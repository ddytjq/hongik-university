There were only 4 nucleotides in DNA, but 20 amino acids in proteins. Further, the 4 nucleotides appeared to be present in equimolar amounts, as if DNA were made of a repeating A,T,G,C unit.			<li>DNA was found to be a linear polymer of nucleotide units, each unit linked to two neighbors, one through the oxygen attached to the deoxyribose 5' carbon, the other through the oxygen attached to the 3' carbon. As a result, DNA chains have a <strong>polarity</strong>. By convention, sequences of nucleotides are usually written in the 5' to 3' direction.			<li>Improvements in analytical techniques in the 1940's and early 1950's revealed that the four bases were not present in equimolar ratios, but that the content of A equalled that of T and that of G was the same as that of C.			<li>The analytical results contributed to the <a href="http://www.accessexcellence.com/AB/BC/James_Dewey_Watson.html">Watson</a>-<a href="http://www.anthro.mankato.msus.edu/information/biography/abcde/crick_francis.html">Crick</a> model of the structure of the B- form of double-stranded DNA. Major features are:			<ul>				<li>Two strands intertwined in a right-handed helix.				<li>The strands' backbones are oriented anti-paralell to one another (5' to 3' and 3' to 5'). They are of opposite polarity.				<li>The sugar-phosphate backbone is on the outside of the helix.				<li>Bases are paired and stacked on the inside.				<li>Geometry strongly favors A-T and G-C base pairs. The model immediately suggested a molecular <a href="#Interp">mechanism</a> for the faithful duplication of the molecule.			</ul>		</ul>		<center>			<p><a href="#Facts">Facts</a> | <a href="#Interp">Interpretations</a> | <a href="#Info">Further Info.</a> | <a href="#bottom">Other Pages</a></p>		</center>		<h4>Interpretations<a name="Interp"></a></h4>		<h4>		<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">			<tr>				<td><img src="i112212.gif" width="176" height="206"></td>				<td>					<ul type="circle">						<li>Faithful duplication of the molecule, such as is possible with this mechanism, is required by <a href="MG111111.html">Mendel's first law</a> (segregation).						<li>Such replication is designated <a href="MG11222.html">semi-conservative</a> since the products consist of one old strand (conserved) and one new strand.					</ul>				</td>			</tr>		</table>		</h4>		<center>			<p><a href="#Facts">Facts</a> | <a href="#Interp">Interpretations</a> | <a href="#Info">Further Info.</a> | <a href="#bottom">Other Pages</a><br>			</p>		</center>		<h4><a name="Info"></a>Further information</h4>		<ul type="square">			<li><a href="http://web.indstate.edu/thcme/mwking/nucleic-acids.html ">Review</a> the basics of DNA structure.			<li>The example shown is known as the <a href="http://w3xe.chem.ucla.edu/uclavoh/rasmol/dodecamer/">Dickerson dodecamer</a>, whose structure was determined by X-ray crystallography.			<li>Under certain conditions DNA forms a right-handed anti-paralell helix in which the base pairs are considerably tilted with respect to the axis of the helix. This form, the A-form, is favored for A-T rich DNA and for double-helical RNA.			<li>Watson-Crick <a href="http://www.accessexcellence.com/AB/GG/dna_molecule.html">DNA structure (one view)</a>; <a href="http://tidepool.st.usm.edu/crswr/doublehelix.html">(further views)</a> suggested a way in which nucleic acid information could be passed from generation to generation.			<li>A left-handed anti-paralell helix, called Z-DNA, can also form, particularly with alternating CpGp sequences.
