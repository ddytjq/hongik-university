<strong>Saturnalia, 22 December 97</strong>
<blockquote>
        <strong><em>The long awaited update!</em></strong>--
        this is a <em>major</em> update of the tutorial.
        Almost every file has been touched in some way.
        <p>
        This release of the online tutorial corresponds with the
        release of the 2nd edition of <em>The Java Tutorial</em> book
        and is the version of the online tutorial that appears on
        the CD-ROM that accompanies that book.
        <p>
        The changes are in progress, but to a large extent
        we have integrated 1.1 information into
        the existing trails, lessons, and examples. This is
        in sharp contrast to the 1.1 notes that were littered
        throughout the previous version of the tutorial and
        were, admittedly, somewhat confusing.
        <p>
        Also, we are in the process of integrating copyedit and
        other changes made to the book version, into the online version.
        This has been completed thoroughly in some areas of the online
        tutorial, and spottily in other areas. We will continue
        with this process throughout the coming months.

        <p>
        New lessons in this tutorial that first appeared in print
        in the 2nd edition of <em>The Java Tutorial</em> book:
        <ul>
        <li>
        <strong>The Java Phenomenon</strong>
        <li>
        <strong>Migrating to 1.1</strong>
        <li>
        <strong>A Preview of Things to Come</strong>
        </ul>

        New trails for this version of the tutorial
        that haven't yet made it to print:
        <ul>
        <li>
        Added a <strong>Putting It All Together</strong> trail
        that provides a large, real-world, client/server example and analyzes it.
        <li>
        Got a totally new <strong>JavaBeans Tutorial</strong>
        by Andy Quinn!
        </ul>
</blockquote>

<strong>8 July 97</strong>
<ul>
<li> One of the goals of the tutorial is to document the latest and greatest
     from JavaSoft <em>as it is released</em>.
     To this end, we've added a lesson about
     <strong>Using Swing Components</strong>.
     The Swing release is an early release of part of the JFC.
     This information is only available from the Java Tutorial.
<li> Added a trail, <strong>Java Security 1.1</strong>,
     covering the new 1.1 security APIs.
<li> Updated the The JavaBeans(tm) Tutorial by Greg Voss.
<li> Promoted <strong>Writing Global Programs</strong> to

<strong>6 June 96</strong> -- Released the Sixth DRAFT.
<blockquote>
This draft is the version on which the book version is based.
The book and online versions aren't exactly the same --
for example, none of the copyeditor's changes 
have made it into the online tutorial yet.
Also, the online tutorial's figures haven't been updated
to be the same as those in the book.
Notable content changes since the fifth draft include:

<ul>
<li> Finished the Common Problems pages.
<li> Added information on the Macintosh JDK.
<li> Added an applet anatomy section to Getting Started.
<li> Improved the talk server example in the applet communication lesson.
</ul>

</blockquote>

<strong>28 Mar 96</strong> -- Released the Fifth DRAFT.
<blockquote>
Many pages in this draft have been rewritten
or expanded upon.
(If you've sent us comments and don't see them reflected in this draft,
please don't be insulted -- 
we haven't finished incorporating reviewer comments.)
Some of the notable changes include:

<ul>
<li> Revised Application Anatomy lesson
     and moved it to the Getting Started trail:
     <strong>The Anatomy of a Java Application</strong>.
     We plan to write an equivalent section
     for applets.

     <strong>The Nuts and Bolts of the Java
     Language</strong> and
     <strong>Objects and Classes in Java</strong>.

     Adding an Applet to an HTML Page
     and
     <strong>Summary</strong>.
<li> Beefed up the applet threads pages:
     <strong>Threads in Applets</strong>.
<li> Added a discussion of peers to the UI trail:
     <strong>Details of the Component Architecture</strong>.
<li> Added material to the native methods trail,
     <strong>Integrating Native Methods into Java Programs</strong>,
     including passing data into and out of native methods
     and accessing Java objects.
<li> Removed some trails: comparison to C/C++, troubleshooting, and tools.
     This information has been (or will be) incorporated into other
     trails/lessons.
</ul>
</blockquote>

<strong>4 Mar 96</strong> -- Released the Fourth DRAFT

Among the normal bug, typo and broken link fixes, this draft includes
revisions to many of our old trails and lessons, plus this new material:

<ul>
<li> Added a new lesson to 
     <strong>Integrating Native Methods into Java Programs</strong>
     trail.

<li> Added new material to and/or wrote from scratch 4 lessons in the

     <strong>Communicating with Other Programs</strong>,
     <strong>Understanding Applet Capabilities and Restrictions</strong>,
        and

     and
     <strong>Practical Considerations when Writing Applets</strong>.

Made the few changes necessary to reflect Beta instead of Pre-Beta.
<li>
Changed the name of this document from
"The Java Programmer's Guide" to
"The Java Language Tutorial: Object-Oriented Programming for the Internet."
Why the long name?
This document is going to be published as a book,
and we wanted to make sure the title
was as descriptive as possible,
without requiring much prior knowledge of the potential buyer.
<li>
Added ALT text to our link graphics, 
so that people using non-graphical browsers
can understand the information the graphic was conveying.
<li>
Added a new lesson,
<strong>Laying Out Components Within a Container</strong>, in the
<strong>Creating a User Interface</strong>
trail.
</ul>

<p>

Everything was updated to reflect the new APIs (except for <i>The "run:"
Protocol Handler</i> and <i>The "text/plain" Content Handler</i>
in the <strong>Getting Started</strong>
trail).
<li>
We fixed many typos, clarified many obfuscations, fixed
broken links and miscommunications.
<li>
We got a face-lift with new icons and a new page design.
<li>
And, we added these trails and lessons:
<ul>
<li>
The
<strong>Writing Applets</strong>
trail has a new lesson:
<strong>Overview of Applets</strong>
which describes
how applets work and how you use the Applet class to create an applet.

<li>
The new
<strong>Creating a User Interface</strong>
trail has two new lessons:
<strong>Overview of UI Elements</strong> which
introduces you to the objects that the Java development environment
provides for building UIs, and 
<strong>Laying Out Components within a Container</strong>
which tells you how to use each of the Components provided in the AWT.

<li>
We've also added the
<strong>Integrating Native Methods into Java Programs</strong>
trail that shows you how to integrate native methods
into your Java programs.

<li>
And finally, we've added two new lessons:
<strong>Threads of Control</strong>
and
<strong>Object-Oriented Programming Concepts</strong>.
</ul>
</ul>
