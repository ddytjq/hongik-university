If the FTSE 100 Index rises by 60% between the Benchmark Level and the Final Level, the customer would receive a return based on 75% of 60%, that is 45%.  Interest of &#163;1,125 (45% of &#163;2,500) would therefore be paid in addition to the original &#163;2,500 capital balance.  If, however, there is no increase in the FTSE 100 Index in that time, the customer would receive back the full capital of &#163;2,500 but no interest on the Equity Tracker.  The returns on the &#163;2,500 One Year Fixed Rate Bond would be unaffected.<P>The <B>Offer Period</B> is from 13 June 2002 until 10 July 2002.<P>Withdrawals from the <B>Fixed Rate Bond</B> element are permitted during the fixed rate period but subject to 60 days' loss of gross interest.  From 1 July 2003, access allowed without penalty.<P>No withdrawals allowed from the <B>Equity Tracker Bond</B> element until after maturity.<BR> From 10 July 2007, access allowed without penalty.</FONT><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>end</b></font></p><p align="right"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#top">back to top</a></font></p><p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="100502"></a>10 May 2002<br>  <b>Mortgage News</b></font></p><p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>NORTHERN   ROCK ADDS UNSECURED CASH RESERVE OPTION<br>  &middot; Flexible personal loans at 8.85% (9.2%APR)</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Northern Rock is enhancing   its flexible fixed and flexible capped mortgage range by adding an <b>Unsecured   Cash Reserve</b>.

Northern Rock   starts Q2 with a pipeline of agreed business of over &pound;3.3 billion - 50%   higher than at the same time last year. Redemptions have continued to run noticeably   lower than natural share, a reflection in part of the transparency of new customers'   products being available to all existing mortgagors.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mortgage arrears - including   Together loans - continue to be tightly controlled and the level of arrears   at more than three months duration remains below half the industry average.   Unsecured personal loans and the secured commercial portfolio are also performing   well. Northern Rock has no residential loan exposure outside the UK nor any   exposure to unsecured corporate lending or leasing.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Funding</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Funding has been well-balanced   and strong. Wholesale monies and the growth in personal savings have both been   positive and have met expectations; and, in addition, during March Northern   Rock successfully completed its sixth securitisation transaction raising &pound;2.4   billion. Notes were placed in Sterling, Euro and, benefiting from SEC registration,   the US Dollar markets, in line with the Company's objectives and retaining its   position at the forefront of securitisation of residential mortgages in the   UK.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Costs</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cost control remains a key   focus for Northern Rock and cost growth is within the Company's strategic target   of being less than total income growth and between one half to two thirds of   the rate in asset growth. This ensures unit costs continue to fall.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Accounting for Reserve   Capital Instruments (&quot;RCIs&quot;)</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The current range of market   expectations of pre-tax profit for 2002 is &pound;310m to &pound;342m. This   does not reflect the recent required change to the accounting treatment for   RCIs following the introduction of UITF 33, the effect of which will be to marginally   enhance our profit attributable to shareholders, return on equity and earnings   per share but will reduce our profit before tax. This is because the coupons   for our RCIs (adjusted for grossing up of tax and the Foundation covenant) will   be treated as a pre, not post, tax deduction.</font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After adjusting for the   new accounting treatment for RCIs, Northern Rock remains comfortable with market   consensus profit expectations. </font></p><p></p><p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Economic Background &amp;   Market Outlook</font></b></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Affordability remains at   sustainable levels given the UK economy as a whole. The housing market remains   both large and robust and the mortgage market - especially with the opportunity   to remortgage at relatively low interest rates - is set to be sufficiently large   for Northern Rock to achieve its lending targets. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the medium term, signs   of a modestly slowing economy may have an impact on housing demand, but this   should be offset by a combination of a shortage of new housing and historically   low interest rates. </font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Comment</b></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adam J Applegarth, Chief   Executive, commented: &quot;Operating performance in the first quarter of the   year continues to be very good.

Not only can they have all their borrowings   at one variable rate, a feature unique to Northern Rock, they can make more   efficient use of their savings. <p><b>together connections</b> customers can <b>either</b> earn interest on their   savings account <b>at the same gross rate as the mortgage or</b> the interest   on the mortgage and unsecured loans will only be charged on the amount owing   <b>minus</b> the average monthly, cleared credit balance from the savings and/or   current account. <p><i>This means, for example, that if a customer has </i><b>together connections</b><i>   mortgage and unsecured loans totalling &#163;100,000 alongside an average monthly   cleared credit savings balance of &#163;20,000 and an average monthly cleared credit   current account balance of &#163;5,000 then the loan amount upon which interest is   charged would be &#163;75,000. </i> <p>The mortgage is the key to customers managing their finances to make sure they   get the most from them. Customers must take the mortgage to qualify for any   other <b>together connections</b> products but there is no obligation to take   out any of the other four products. <p>The mortgage rates are: <ul>  <li> <b>6.59% (7.3% APR) for loans up to 90% of the property value (LTV) </b></li>  <li><b>6.89% (7.4% APR) for loans up to 95% LTV. </b> </li>  <br>  The rates will track the Bank of England base rate until 1 January 2005. Thereafter   the rate is guaranteed to be below Northern Rock's Standard Variable Base Mortgage   Rate (SVR currently 7.25% pa) for the life of the loan. </ul><p>Northern Rock Sales and Marketing Director Andy Kuipers said: "<b>together   connections</b> will suit all lifestyles, no matter how busy or unpredictable.   We are unique in offering a secured loan, unsecured personal loan and credit   card all at the one variable rate. In addition, savers can take advantage of   an unprecedented choice. They can either earn gross savings interest at the   same rate as the mortgage, or use their savings, current account and the flexible   features to reduce mortgage interest and potentially repay their loan earlier." <p><b>together connections - The Loan Options </b> <p><b>together connections</b> offers a flexible home loan with the additional   options of an unsecured personal loan (up to 30% LTV, maximum &#163;30,000) plus   a credit card (with a guaranteed minimum limit of &#163;5,000) all charged at one   variable rate. <p><b>together connections</b> offers consumer friendly benefits - daily interest   calculation, no risk charge, no insurance "tie-ins" and no early repayment charge.   (If the secured loan is repaid and the unsecured loan or credit card balances   remain outstanding, the unsecured loan rate and credit card rate will increase   to 3% above Northern Rock's prevailing Standard Variable Base Mortgage Rate.) <p><b>together connections</b> offers a "lifestyle" loan with the flexibility   of overpayments, underpayments, payment holidays and redrawing of funds. <p><b>together connections</b> offers a tracking guarantee linked to the Bank   of England Base Rate. Northern Rock guarantees that the 95% LTV tier will be   no more than 1.5% above Bank of England Base Rate until 1 January 2005. Thereafter   the rate will always be below Northern Rock's Standard Variable Base Mortgage.   The rate on the 90% LTV tier is guaranteed to be always below the rate for the   95% LTV tier. <p><b>together connections-</b><b> The Savings Account </b> <p><b>together connections</b> savings account is called <b>Save Direct Connections</b>.   Its main features are: <ul>  <li>A telephone based account where customers can receive around the clock information     via the Save Direct telephone service </li>  <li> Six penalty free withdrawals allowed per calendar year </li>  <li> Customers can add to their savings at any time with any amount from &#163;250     upwards. </li>  <li>Interest can be paid annually at the same rate as the <b>together connections</b>     mortgage. </li></ul><p><b>together connections - The Current Account </b> <p><b>together connections</b> Current Account offers a complete banking service   with regular statements and instant access to funds. <p>Customers can: <ul>  <li> withdraw cash from any one of over 19,900 LINK machines countrywide or     a Northern Rock branch </li>  <li> use the Visa Delta payment card as an electronic cheque or as a cheque     guarantee card </li>  <li> arrange direct debits or standing orders </li>  <li> arrange an overdraft (subject to status) </li></ul><p><b>together connections - How the connections work </b> <p>There are two options: <p><b>1. Connections Benefit: Available with both the Save Direct Connections   savings account and the Current Account.</b> Northern Rock calculates the average   monthly cleared credit balance in the account(s). The average cleared credit   balance for the month will be set against the capital balance upon which mortgage   interest and any unsecured personal loan interest is charged. The result is   that the amount the customer pays in interest is reduced. </font><blockquote>   <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With this option, there     is no tax to pay on any benefit because the customer receives no interest.     Instead, borrowers can potentially pay off the mortgage early without increasing     monthly payments. </font>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(This benefit does not     apply to the credit card.) </font> </blockquote><p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Connections Interest:   Available only with the Save Direct Connections savings account.</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">   Traditionally, customers pay a higher rate of interest on their borrowings than   they receive on their savings. Now customers can choose to earn gross annual   interest on their savings account at the same rate as the <b>together connections</b><i><b>   </b></i>mortgage. (Where applicable, this is subject to tax.). </font> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>together connections   mortgages also include the following benefits:</b> </font> <ul>  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Free Risk Charge</b>     (All Northern Rock's new loan products offer free mortgage indemnity guarantee     insurance right up to 95% LTV.) </font>     <p></p>  </li>  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b> Free Mortgage Payment     Protection Insurance for six months, including a free job search service.     </b> </font>     <p></p>  </li>  <li> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>"Help With Costs"</b>     - Remortgage customers can opt for a free legal service provided by a Northern     Rock panel solicitor or, if they wish to use their own solicitor, receive     a &#163;150 contribution towards legal fees in England and Wales or &#163;250 in Scotland.     Purchase customers have the option of a &#163;200 contribution towards legal fees.     </font>     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Upon completion, for       all customers opting to take Help With Costs, the standard valuation/administration       fee will also be refunded (or contribution of &#163;200 in Scotland, where valuation       is carried out prior to application).

However, if customers move       home and transfer their existing mortgage or if they move home and take       out a new Northern Rock mortgage within 3 months, Northern Rock will refund       the amount to the customer after completion of the new loan. </font></p>  </li></ul><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Applications for <b>together   connections</b> can be made: </font> <ul>  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">through any Northern     Rock branch</font></li>  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> by telephoning <b>0845     600 9666</b> </font></li>  <li> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">on-line via Northern     Rock's website <a href="http://www.northernrock.com/html/mortgages/mortgages.htm" target="_top">www.northernrock.com</a></font></li>  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> through independent     financial advisers</font> </li></ul><p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ADDITIONAL INFORMATION   </font></b> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Maximum LTV</b> </font><blockquote>   <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 95% for secured loan,<br>    30% (or maximum of &#163;30,000) for unsecured loan. <br>    (Mix of LTVs optional e.g. customer could choose to have 70% secured and 30%     unsecured subject to maximum loan amount.) </font></p></blockquote><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Early Repayment Charge</b>   </font><blockquote>   <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nil. <br>    Redemption of unsecured loan/credit card will not affect the secured home     loan rate. <br>    Redemption of secured home loan only will result in: </font></p></blockquote><ul>  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> higher rate (SVR plus     3%) being charged on unsecured loan/credit card </font></li>  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">the savings and Current     Accounts will no longer be offset against the loan products.
