  THE ACCOUNT</b><br></font>
  The Falcon First account has been developed as an introduction to the benefits of saving for children from birth, up to the age of 16. As it's never too soon to start saving for the future, the account is backed by an attractive interest rate which shows how simple it can be to make money grow.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>AVAILABILITY</b></font>
  <br>
  Please note, this account is available only to those resident in the Society's area of operations. <!--<a class=s5 href="./availability.html" target=_top>Click here</a>-->Contact your nearest branch or agency to check on availability.
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>HOW TO OPEN YOUR ACCOUNT</b></font>
  <br>
  Please note that we will require sight of documents which prove the child's identity and home address.
  The Falcon First account can be opened at any Society Branch or Agency. The account can be opened in one of two ways:
  <br><br>
  <b>Children under 7</b><br>
  Accounts can be opened for under seven's by a responsible individual who is willing to operate the account as a trustee. Account trustees are not restricted to parents or grandparents only and often include other family or friends who wish to deposit amounts for the child. Once the child   has reached the age of seven, should it be required, the account may be transferred into the child's name.
  <br><br>
  As a trustee, if you are a new investor with the Society, you will be asked to provide one form of personal identification and another for address verification, both for yourself, and the child involved. A list of the acceptable items is displayed in all Branches and Agencies and a copy will be made available on request. All requests for identification are standard and conform to regulations which protect you as the customer and guard against fraudulent transactions.
  <br><br>
  <b>Children 7 or over</b><br>
  A Falcon First account can be opened by a child over seven in their own name and they are therefore allowed to make deposits and withdrawals without a trustee's signature. They will be required to provide one form of personal identification and another for address verification.
  <br><br>
    
  The Falcon First account is available until the age of 16 when the holder will be informed of the alternative savings options available at the time.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>ADDING TO YOUR INVESTMENT</b></font>
  <br>
  You can add to your account at any time and the current rate of interest will be applied immediately.
  <br><br>
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>ACCESS TO YOUR SAVINGS</b></font>
  <br>
  There are no charges or penalties with a Falcon First account. You have immediate access to your savings and are not required to give notice.
  <br><br>
  Withdrawals can be made at any Society Branch or Agency.
  <br><br>
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>INTEREST PAYMENTS</b></font>
  <br>
  Interest is paid to the account annually on the 31st December. To ensure that interest is paid gross, parents or legal guardians must ensure that they sign the Inland Revenue declaration form on behalf of the child. When you open the account our staff will draw your attention to the appropriate form.
  <br><br>Current interest rates will be supplied to you on request and are on display in all Branch and Agency offices.
  <br>
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>INCOME TAX</b></font>
  <br>
  Interest will be paid after deduction of income tax at the lower rate or, subject to the required certification, gross. Registration forms are available from any of the Society's Branches or Agencies, or direct from the Inland Revenue. If you have <a class=s5 href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readermain.html" target=_blank>Adobe Acrobat Reader</a> click <a class=s5 href="http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/pdfs/r85.pdf" target=_blank>here to download the R85 form</a>. If you are a non-taxpayer you will be able to claim repayment of this tax directly from the Inland Revenue. You can also claim a repayment of tax, if your taxable income falls within the starting rate band and you are eligible to pay less tax than the amount deducted from your interest. Individuals who are liable at the higher rate of income tax will have to pay additional tax on the interest to cover the difference between the tax deducted and the higher rate tax due.
  <br><br>
  The Society is required to supply the Inland Revenue with details of all interest paid or credited to investors each year.
  <br><br>
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>FALCON FIRST
  <br>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ISSUE</b></font>
  <ol>
    <li>INVESTMENTS: Each account is subject to an initial investment of £1 and additional sums of any amount may be invested at any time up to the account maximum of £10,000.
        <br><br>

    <li>COOLING OFF PERIOD: If, after careful consideration, you decide that you are not happy with your choice of savings or investment account(s) and you bring this to our attention within 14 days of your initial receipt, we will help you to either switch accounts or return your money with any interest earned over that period*. We will ignore any notice periods and additional charges in these cases.
        <br><br>*Please note: Cheques paid in within the 14 day period will have to clear before a refund can be given.
        <br>

    <li>WITHDRAWALS: These are payable on demand up to £500 in cash or up to the account balance by cheque to be available immediately at any Branch Office. Withdrawals are also available at the Society's Agencies - up to £300 in cash and amounts up to the balance by cheque - but prior notice may be required.
        <br><br>
      
    <li>INTEREST: This is calculated on a daily basis, including the day of receipt but excluding the day of withdrawal and paid on 31st December each year. Interest will be added directly to the account.
        <br><br>

     <li>INTEREST RATES: We reserve the right to amend interest rates at our discretion using one or more of the following methods:
