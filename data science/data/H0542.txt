<P>In 1951, Hodgkin and Huxley completed the equations that described the
currents  underlying  neuronal   action  potentials,   and plotted   a
numerical solution    to   their equations---using    a  hand-operated
calculating machine.  After performing  calculations for 3  weeks they
were halfway  down the falling  phase of the  potential.  They decided
this was sufficient, and included a figure  of the incomplete trace in
their famous 1952 paper (1).</P>

<P>Today, undergraduates can watch simulation packages such as GENESIS or
NEURON generate this trace in milliseconds.  Although further advances
in computing power will continue to  contribute to the rapid growth of
computational   neuroscience, increasing only  the  size  and speed of
simulations is not  sufficient to  sustain  the field.  Progress  also
requires understanding of the basic principles  used in simulating the
function  of    neurons and neural    circuits.  These  principles are
effectively   presented in the  second   edition  of Koch and  Segev's
"Methods in Neuronal Modeling."</P>

<P>Seven new chapters reflect the considerable progress that has occurred
in the 9 years since the  first edition.  In particular, the intrinsic
cellular properties  of neurons are  now investigated in great detail.
For example, De Schutter and  Smolen's chapter describes sophisticated
representations  of neuronal   calcium  dynamics.  (Calcium influences
multiple  neuronal  processes,  including  spike  timing  and synaptic
modification, but early models did not address the complex interaction
of factors that ultimately determine  calcium concentration.)  Another
topic that has seen much recent progress is the kinetics of individual
synaptic currents, and the chapter by  Destexhe, Mainen, and Sejnowski
combines models developed  by  many researchers  to simulate  a  small
network   of  neurons exhibiting    complex   behavior.   A   separate
contribution by Mainen and  Sejnowski covers compartmental simulations
for  modeling active ion   channels  in dendrites.   Other hot  topics
addressed    in new chapters   include the  analysis  of small network
dynamics   (Abbott and Marder),  spike  time variability (Gabbiani and
Koch), and  the simulation of neurons on  computer  chips (Douglas and
Mahowald).</P>

<P>Some of   the  seven chapters retained and    revised from the earlier
edition have already proved  useful as references  to a wide  range of
modelers.  These include the contribution by Rall, a seminal figure in
the   field of  cable    theory  (originally derived  for  calculation
essential to trans-Atlantic  telegraph cables, but highly relevant  to
computing electrical potentials    in  nerve cells),  and  Rinzel  and
Ermentrout's phase plane  analysis of neuronal dynamics.  The original
chapter by Segev on compartmental models has  been greatly extended to
cover popular simulation software.  It now  provides the best starting
point   for a   reader  seeking a    computational tutorial,  although
(overall) this  volume is  more useful   as a  reference  for advanced
research than an introductory text.</P>

<P>Those interested in becoming adept at computational modeling will find
this book most helpful when it is  read while carrying out simulations
on software  packages such    as GENESIS or   NEURON (2).    Extensive
experience with  specific simulations  provides a deeper understanding
of how individual parameters influence overall dynamics.  to this end,
many   chapters  provide   useful  links  to   interactive  tutorials,
simulations, and programs on the World Wide Web.</P>

<P>Although many of the basic principles by which single neurons function
are well  known, many of the  unifying principles at the network level
remain undiscovered.   For  example, regularities in  the  anatomy and
physiology of different subregions  of the cortex suggest that similar
cortical dynamics  underlie  a  range  of  functions.  A  variety   of
computational models  have addressed this problem,  but  they have not
converged on  a shared set of principles.   This volume presents three
different perspectives on models of cortical networks: Shamma examines
unit  activity   in auditory  cortex;   Protopapas, Vanier,  and Bower
address  local  field   potentials  and  neuronal  properties  in  the
olfactory  cortex;   and Hansel   and   Sompolinsky consider   feature
selectivity in the  visual cortex.  Given  the vast scope of the field
of cortical information processing, these authors  could not cover the
side range of theoretical work as comprehensively as do the authors of
the other chapters; for example they do not mention the many models of
associative memory  in hippocampus   or self-organization of   feature
detectors in      primary visual cortex.   But     they  do retain the
appropriate   emphasis  on  accurate   representation  of   biological
parameters, particularly in  the  chapter by Protopapas  et  al.  (who
argue that  realistic network models  can provide   more than  just  a
demonstration   of  the   plausibility    of   preexisting  theories).
Ultimately  the choice   between cortical models  will   come down  to
biological constraints.    Few     if  any, existing       models have
simultaneously   accounted for    intrinsic  properties   of  neurons,
responses at the system level (such  as unit recording and local field
potentials), and  behavioral function.  But  neglect of the biological
level may miss  essential  information processing capabilities of  the
computational soup of membranes and modulators in the brain.</P>

<P>As Shamma  notes    in his chapter,  researchers    choosing among the
innumerable  network topologies and   algorithms must remember "It  is
relatively easy in general to come up with a  network that can perform
any desired task....   It  is a different matter   to come  up  with a
biologically plausible network    to perform the  task."  Research  on
brain function will only converge on a unified explanation when models
are effectively constrained by  biological detail at a cellular level.
"Methods in  Neuronal Modeling"  provides  an important  step  in that
process.</P>
