A brilliant team built around the greatest player of the era, Johann Cruyff, had captivated the globe with an exhilarating, free-flowing attacking style of football - known as "Total Football" - that swept aside everything in its path. In an era riddled by defensive cynicism, Cruyff's team was a sheer joy to watch. There has been nothing like them since. <BR><BR><B>Final opponents </B><BR>However, their final opponents in Munich, hosts Germany, did not&nbsp;follow the script. Although the Dutch took the lead with a first-minute penalty from Johan Neeskens, a Paul Breitner penalty and opportunist strike from Gerd Müller gave the Germans the title. <BR><BR><B>Total football </B><BR>The Dutch coach was Rinus Michels, who had pioneered the "Total Football" style with AFC Ajax in the early 1970s. Michels is now a revered football "guru" and UEFA technical expert, and takes us through his World Cup final day 28 years ago. <BR><BR><B>Long day </B><BR>"The homework was done, it was only a question of how to pass a long day," says Michels of the morning of the game. "For a coach and the players too, it is a long time to fill." Michels followed breakfast and his team talk over coffee and cake with a period of reflection on his own. "I went for a one-hour walk to relax, before we went into our normal routine." <BR><BR><B>Job in hand <BR></B>Kick-off time rapidly approached, and Michels's job was to ensure that his team were ready for the job in hand. He made a final decision that RSC Anderlecht winger Rob Rensenbrink would play despite a nagging thigh injury, and looked into his players' faces. <BR><BR><B>Lots of confidence </B><BR>"They were confident because they had played a marvellous tournament with beautiful victories in a spectacular and impressive playing style for everybody. There was a lot of confidence that they could repeat it against Germany," remembers Michels, whose side, boasting a fearsome attacking threat of Cruyff, up-and-coming midfield star Neeskens, lightning-fast front-runner Johnny Rep and experienced midfield schemer Wim van Hanagem, were the people's favourites to conquer the world crown. <BR><B><BR>'Good luck' </B><BR>"It was just a question of saying 'good luck'," says Michels when the players left the dressing room for the pitch. The formalities over, English referee Jack Taylor got the game under way. Inside 100 seconds, Michels's team were a goal up, Neeskens firing home from the spot after Uli Hoeness had brought down Cruyff in the first attack of the game. <BR><BR><B>No advantage </B><BR>"The quick goal was not an advantage for us team-tactically," recalls Michels. "The Germans had the same playing style as today, a reactive style. But [after the goal] they had no doubt about their tactics - they had to go forward." <BR><BR><B>Turning the tide </B><BR>Germany were successful in turning the tide by half-time, Breitner's penalty and Müller's astute finish giving them the edge. Michels remembers the interval as a fraught period. "I had to substitute Rensenbrink, and my central defender Wim Rijsbergen was on the table with a bad injury. I had to wait for what the doctor was going to say. I had to make the right choices. This has to be done in ten minutes, there is a lot of pressure."<BR><BR><B>More aggression <BR></B>Rijsbergen went out for the second half, with Michels telling his team to keep up their pressure game, but with more aggression. The Dutch swarmed around the Germans' goal - "but we couldn't get the goal we probably deserved," says Michels. "We did everything we could, it was a question of drawing or losing 3-1 on a counter. We had the quality to be able to score in the last minute, so I was never in the mood that it was over." <BR><BR><B>Bitter disappointment </B><BR>Yet for all of the Dutch side's barrage of the German goal, the equaliser did not&nbsp;come. German captain Franz Beckenbauer collected the World Cup, leaving Michels and his shattered players to face bitter disappointment. Michels recollects the aftermath: "In the dressing room we were not in the best mood. After the game, we had to attend a banquet, and the winners were celebrating.<BR><BR><B>Big festival </B><BR>"We went to our hotel, and we thought that there would not be a pleasant ambience - but we came into a big festival organised by the wives of the players!" The post-match party was followed by a rapturous welcome from hundreds of thousands of people back home. "It was unforgettable," says Michels. "We saw the reaction of the press, and we became aware of what we had done for the Dutch people." <BR><BR><B>Glow of satisfaction <BR></B>Michels says that once the initial feeling of disappointment had subsided, a warm glow of satisfaction emerged. Despite their defeat, the Dutch would always be remembered for "Total Football". The coach would take charge of FC Barcelona, taking Cruyff and Neeskens with him, before returning to the Dutch national team helm many years later after an eventful club career. <BR><B>Tasting glory </B><BR>In 1988, an older and even wiser Michels finally tasted glory. He led a second generation of heroes in orange, including Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard, to the UEFA European Championship at the same Munich Olympiastadion where a glorious World Cup adventure had floundered 14 years before. And when the curtain comes down on Sunday's World Cup final, Michels will doubtless feel considerable sympathy for either Brazil or Germany - whichever team is unable to take their fantastic dream to the ultimate conclusion. <BR><BR><B>Hear Rinus Michels</B><BR>Hear Rinus Michels looking back on the 1974 final by clicking on the appropriate link in the "Related Interactive" section on the right-hand side of this page.  </TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="5" BORDER="0" WIDTH="355" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt" xmlns:user="http://mycompany.com/mynamespace"><TR><TD class="NewsBody"><a target="_blank" href="&#xA;					/news/newsId=27447,printer.htmx&#xA;				"><img SRC="/images/All/buttons/printer_friendly.gif" border="0" width="130" height="9" vspace="10" /></a></TD><TD align="right" class="NewsBody"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="window.open('/news/sendmail.htmx?newsId=27447','SendMail','width=355,height=516')"><img SRC="/images/All/buttons/mail_friend.gif" border="0" width="99" height="9" vspace="10" /></a></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="5" BORDER="0" WIDTH="355" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt" xmlns:user="http://mycompany.com/mynamespace"><TR><TD class="NewsBody">©uefa.com 1998-2002.
