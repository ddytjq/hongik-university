Please note tax is not reclaimable. Higher rate tax payers may have an additional liability. For all With Profits Income Bonds sold at the 5.00% interim rate, Legal & General expect to retain this as the interim bonus rate until the end of 2002,

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">
balance is an alternative approach to managing your money which gives you the potential for generous returns and easy access.<P>

It combines two types of product:<P>

<UL>
<LI>balance Savings - an instant access account provided by Northern Rock for your short term needs.<P>

<LI>balance Investment - a With Profits Income Bond provided by Legal & General which aims to give higher returns than the average deposit account over the medium to long term.
</UL><P>

We'll place half of your total investment in each product, giving you the best of both worlds: a balance between generous interest with instant access and better growth prospects for your medium to long term investment.<P>

By investing in both of these products together you effectively create your own financial portfolio, which will provide your savings with excellent growth potential without having to take undue risks.<P>

The minimum total investment is &#163;5,000. The maximum total investment is &#163;500,000 per investor or &#163;1,000,000 for joint investments. After your initial deposit you cannot make additional deposits into balance Savings.<P>

It's an exciting idea, made possible by Northern Rock joining forces with Legal & General - a company with a long and proven expertise in managing investment portfolios.</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="1">
*The Legal & General With Profits Income Bond is unsuitable for short term investments and any encashments from it may be subject to deductions. See <A HREF="ba_keyfeats.htm">Key Features</A> for further details.

The 'savings' part of balance gives you unlimited, penalty-free access to your money. Simply write to Northern Rock and you will be sent a cheque or call into a branch for a cash (maximum &#163;500) or cheque withdrawal. Or your money can be transferred into another Northern Rock account.<P>

<B>GUARANTEED INTEREST RATE</B>
</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">
Northern Rock guarantee that your interest rate will remain fixed at 7.00% gross p.a. AER (6.75% gross p.a. for monthly interest) until 1 April 2003. After this date, the interest rate may vary, as with other instant access accounts. We will write to you shortly before the end of the fixed rate period to advise you of the rate payable.

<B>CHOOSE HOW TO RECEIVE YOUR INTEREST</B>

Choose to have your interest paid annually or monthly. Annual interest is due on 1 February each year and is paid into a nominated bank or building society account of your choice on the next bank working day. Monthly interest will be paid on the first bank working day of each month into the nominated account.

<B>INVEST WITH CONFIDENCE</B>
</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">
The With Profits Income Bond part of balance is provided by Legal & General. It's a low risk investment designed to provide the potential for greater returns than are available from deposit accounts without all the ups and downs associated with a direct investment in the stock market. The bond grows by the addition of a bonus each year.<P>

You should be prepared to hold the investment for at least five years.
</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2" COLOR="#333366">
<B>HOW IT WORKS</B>
</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">
The With Profits Income Bond invests in a wide spread of investments, managed by Legal & General's professional investment managers. Although the capital is not guaranteed the Bond offers potential for long-term growth or income in excess of that normally available from a deposit account. It does this by investing in a diverse portfolio of shares, fixed interest securities and commercial property.
</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="1" COLOR="#000000">
Unlike the deposit account, capital from the Legal & General With Profits Income Bond is not guaranteed.<BR>
The actual bonus rate declared each year may not be equal to the interim bonus rate, although it could be lower or higher.
</FONT><P>

<B><A NAME="Bond">PLUS A WITH PROFITS INCOME BOND</A></B>
</FONT><P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">
The return from these investments is passed on to you each year by payment of a bonus, the amount of which is determined by three key factors:<P>

<UL>
<LI>income the fund receives such as interest, dividends and rent
<LI>any movement in the market value of shares, fixed interest securities and commercial property
<LI>Legal & General's future expectations of income and growth of the investments.
</UL><P>

By this method it is possible to declare bonus rates, and while these are not guaranteed they are potentially less volatile than those based on interest rates.<P>

The current interim bonus is 5.00% net p.a. (equivalent to 6.25% gross p.a. for a basic rate tax payer from a conventional deposit account. Please note non-tax payers cannot reclaim the equivalent of basic rate tax).

Income payments will usually be made to the same account that you select for your balance Savings interest payments.<P>

Returns depend on future bonus rates, which are not guaranteed. This Bond is unsuitable for short term investments and any encashments from it may be subject to deductions. Bonus rates may be significantly higher or lower than the rate applicable at the time of investment. Encashments in the first five years are subject to a deduction. Encashments may be subject to a market value reduction if investment returns are less than required to support bonuses. The capital value is not guaranteed as explained in the <A HREF="ba_keyfeats.htm">Key Features</A> document. There may be a liability to higher rate tax on any encashments. Tax assumptions are based on current legislation which may change in the future. Full written details are available on request.

The balance Savings rate is fixed until 1 April 2003. The annual gross rate is 7.00%/AER (5.60% net). The monthly gross rate is 6.75%, 6.96%AER (5.40% net). Gross p.a. is the rate of interest paid yearly without deduction of lower rate tax to eligible non-taxpayers. The Annual Equivalent Rate (AER) is a notional rate which illustrates the contractual interest rate (excluding any bonus interest) as if paid and compounded on an annual basis.<P>

Interest will be paid after deduction of income tax at the lower rate (currently 20%) or, subject to the required certification, gross. Where the tax deducted exceeds an investor's liability (if any), a claim may be made to the Inland Revenue for repayment of tax. For individuals whose income falls within the lower rate bands, the tax deducted will match their liability to tax on the interest and they will have no further tax to pay on it. Individuals who are liable at the higher rate of income tax of 40% will have to pay additional tax on the interest to cover the difference between the tax deducted and the higher rate tax due.<P>

You should include the amount of interest earned on your annual Income Tax Return. We have to provide the Inland Revenue with information about the amounts of interest our customers receive. If you are a non-taxpayer, you may be eligible to have your interest paid gross. Inland Revenue registration forms and notes on who can qualify for gross interest are available on request or from your Inland Revenue office. Please note, an Inland Revenue registration form must be completed for each account. Previous registrations will not cover any new account which you open.<P>

Proof of identity must accompany your application.<P>

For your security, your telephone calls may be recorded.<P>
