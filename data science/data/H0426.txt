					<p>The University Gynecology Hospital in Basel and the Faculty of Law of the University of Basel initiated the symposium together with other researchers from the Swiss Na-tional Research Program 46 (Implantations, Transplantations) as well as the Swiss Society for Biomedical Ethics.</p>
<p>A bill on embryonal research went into public consultation May 22nd. Dr. Theodor Weber from the Swiss Federal Office for Public Health in Bern introduced the essen-tials of the bill. Opinions can be voiced on this bill until the end of August. The bill re-gulates obtaining embryonal stem cells from surplus embryos for research, research on embryonal stem cells as well as research on surplus embryos. The bill should prevent the misuse of surplus human embryos and of human embryonal stem cells in research and should protect human dignity.</p>
<p>The decision making process of the Swiss National Research Foundation regarding the grant application from the researcher Dr. Marisa Jaconi from the University of Geneva was explained by Prof. P.J. Meier-Abt from the University of Zurich. The National Research Foundation came to an intermediate solution by approving the use of imported human stem cells under restrictive conditions. A position paper on this topic was passed without dissenting votes on 28 September 2001. The grant applicant Marisa Jaconi was one of the speakers at the symposium and presented goals of stem cell research.</p>
<p>Prof. Alois Gratwohl from the Hematology Department of the University Hospital in Basel pleaded for setting guard rails on embryonal research, but not for banning such research, would could lead to a dead-end. The function of the ethics council from the Novartis company was explained by Prof. Hans-Peter Schreiber, the chair-person of the council. Novartis developed a criteria catalogue to regulate the re-search on embryos.</p>
<p>Prof. Wolfgang Holzgreve presented the view of the University Basel (Haematology) regarding the meaning of stem cells for reproductive and obstetric medicine. He refered in particular to the possibility of obtaining stem cells from umbilical cord blood. Within the framework of the Basel Cord Blood Project, a cord blood bank has been established with the goal of being able to provide stem cell transplantations for ap-propriate patients. Results of prenatal treatment with stem cells was presented by Dr. Daniel Surbek, who also works at the University Gynecology Hospital in Basel. He pointed out that certain genetic diseases can cause organ damage even before birth, and prenatal stem cell therapy could therefore be beneficial for such unborn li-ves. The ethicist Dr. Ulrike Kostka discussed the acceptance of stem cell research, and presented a study on that topic. A survey of involved persons, among those doctors nurses and pregnant women, revealed that research on adult stem cells was generally rated as unobjectionable compared to research on embryonal stem cells. Further speakers were Prof. Kurt Seelmann (University of Basel), who discussed legislative aspects of stem cell research, Prof. Laurent Bernheim (University of Geneva), who presented possibilities of treating muscle damage and Prof. Alberto Bondol-fi (University of Zurich/Lausanne), who discussed stem cell research from an ethical point of view.</p>
<p>In the closing discussion, not only the therapeutic possibilities but also the legislative aspects of stem cell research were controversially discussed. The symposium closed with an evening event, to which the public was invited.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="info"><strong>Further Information:</strong><br />
