      <p><b><a class="content" name="benefits"></a>What are the benefits?</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>You decide on the level of benefits you require. In other words you 
          want a retirement fund which secures your financial independence throughout 
          your retirement.</li>
        <li>Your Plan is written under Trust - this means that it is held by one 
          or more persons (the trustees) for the benefit of other persons (the 
          beneficiaries). Foresight supplies the necessary documentation and secures 
          Revenue approval. Foresight arranges the necessary registration of your 
          Plan with the Pensions Board and assists the Trustees (usually the employer) 
          in ensuring compliance with the requirements of the Pensions Act 1990.</li>
        <li> Plan Reviews. It is essential that the benefits being provided under 
          your Plan are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that your pension 
          expectations and your protection, and that of your dependents, are kept 
          in line with earnings and changes in circumstances. Ulster Bank Insurance 
          Services will contact you each year and provide you with information 
          to facilitate your Plan reviews.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b><a class="content" name="taxefficient"></a>Is Foresight tax efficient?</b></p>
      <p>There are a number of features which make the FORESIGHT Retirement Plan 
        the most tax efficient way of providing retirement benefits. Relief is 
        available in accordance with the 1972 Finance Act and current income tax 
        legislation. </p>
      <p><b>Tax advantages</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Regular contributions made by an employer are deductible for tax purposes 
          as an expense of management in the accounting period in which they are 
          paid. </li>
        <li>Regular contributions of up to 15% of salary can also be made by an 
          employee. Tax relief is given to employees under a net pay arrangement 
          by deducting the contributions from gross pay before PAYE tax deductions 
          are calculated. Tax relief is therefore given immediately at the highest 
          rate of tax paid by the employee.</li>
        <li>PRSI relief for both employer and employee is calculated in this manner.</li>
        <li>One off contributions (employer and/or employee) to boost funding 
          may also be made from time to time.</li>
        <li>The fund(s) in which contributions are invested are exempt from both 
          Income Tax and Capital Gains Tax. This means that returns on these funds 
          will be greater than that for equivalent taxed forms of investment.</li>
        <li>At retirement and depending on the number of years service of the 
          employee, up to 1.5 times the employee's your salary may be taken as 
          a tax-free cash lump sum.</li>
      </ul>
      <p align="right"><a class="content" style="text-decoration:none;" href="#top">top 
        ^</a></p>
      <p><b><a class="content" name="benefitsforemployees"></a>What are the benefits 
        for employees/executives?<br>
        </b>Optional benefits which may be provided for employees are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Retirement Pension</li>
        <li>Tax Free Lump Sum</li>
        <li>Death-In-Service Benefit</li>
        <li>Disability Benefit</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b><a class="content" name="flexiblecontributions"></a>Can contributions 
        be flexible?<br>
        </b>The greater the contributions to the Foresight Retirement Plan the 
        bigger the retirement fund that will accumulate. The maximum amount that 
        can be contributed to the Plan depends on each individual case and is 
        subject to Revenue Commissioner's requirements. </p>
      <p>Both regular (monthly, quarterly, half-yearly and yearly) and once-off 
        single contributions may be made to your Foresight Retirement Plan. Indeed, 
        both regular and single contributions can be made to the same plan.</p>
      <p>Regular contributions may be increased at any time. In addition to the 
        flexibility this provides contributions may be automatically increased 
        each year.</p>
      <p><b>Stopping Contributions<br>
        </b>Provided the accumulated fund has a positive 
        value contributions may be suspended for a period of time.&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;</p>

      <p><b><a class="content" name="retirement"></a>Is there an early retirement 
        option?<br>
        </b>With the employers approval members may take early retirement from 
        age 50 or over. In the event of serious ill health members may retire 
        at any time. Obviously on early retirement the benefits available will 
        be determined by the fund accumulated at that time.</p>
      <p><b><a class="content" name="leavingservice"></a>What are the benefits 
        on leaving service?</b> <br>
        On leaving service after 5 years membership of the Plan members are entitled 
        to a personal benefit in accordance with the Pension Act 1900. The benefit 
        will be determined by the contributions invested up to the date of leaving 
        and performance achieved.</p>
      <p>The value of the preserved benefit may be transferred to the pension 
        plan of a new employer or to a personal retirement bond. If leaving service 
        before five years have elapsed and where there is not a compulsory entitlement 
        to a benefit a member may receive a return in lieu of other benefits of 
        their own contributions (if any) subject to the deduction of tax (currently 
        25%).&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;</p>
      <p><b><a class="content" name="charges"></a>What are the charges?<br>
        </b>Pension clients need to know that they are getting a good deal for 
        monies invested. As such, our management charging structure has been designed 
        to provide pension clients with excellent value for money over the wide 
        range of pension plan options available.</p>
