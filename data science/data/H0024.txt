<P><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Introduction</font></b></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;The goal of this research 
  has been to help map and better understand the processes by which genetic knowledge 
  is integrated into the lived experience of &quot;high-risk&quot; family members. 
  This study was designed to clarify the social and cultural dimensions of what 
  is likely to be the proliferation of genetic testing and screening. Our strategy 
  was to focus on both the barriers and bridges to the use of genetic information 
  by moving beyond the medical center or clinic, into the natural settings (Duster, 
  Matza, and Wellman, 1979). We wanted to learn what it means for families to 
  have these new reproductive options and we wanted to examine the consequences 
  for the quality of family life.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">[footnote: Genetic 
  screening is distinguished from testing primarily by its target population. 
  Testing is the use of specific assays to determine the genetic status of individuals 
  already suspected to be at high risk, while screening focuses on the general 
  population, or at least a larger population thought to be at risk-in contrast 
  to individuals (OTA, 1992:4). While our immediate focus in this study was on 
  individuals considered "at high risk," those with a family history, the larger 
  purpose of the study was to learn from high-risk families in the hope that this 
  knowledge would be useful to the public as a whole as genetic diagnostics become 
  more widely available.]</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mapping and sequencing 
  of the human genome has been described as the first major step to a new way 
  of thinking about, and addressing, human health and illness. The Human Genome 
  Project is often characterized as a turning point, unlocking mysteries of human 
  nature and developing the foundation for the elimination of many forms of disease 
  (Kevles and Hood, 1992; Bishop and Waldholz, 1990; Kitcher, 1996, Nelkin &amp; 
  Lindee,1995). Analysts have noted that molecular genetics, as well as the many 
  related new technologies and analytical tools, are having an impact far beyond 
  the realm of human health as well. For example, social institutions such as 
  families, education and business have experienced an array of new challenges 
  and opportunities as a consequence of discoveries in genetics (Powell, 1997; 
  Fujimura, 1997).</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much has been written about 
  the ethics and potential social implications of the rapidly proliferating new 
  technologies. Concerns are reflected in the form of a growing body of legislation 
  and the establishment of a number of new oversight and policy developments at 
  both the state and the federal level (New York Times, Oct. 18,1997; Rothenberg, 
  1997). These bodies have relied heavily on the expertise clinical geneticists, 
  legal and social expertise of the Ethical, Legal and Social Issues Program of 
  the Human Genome Project. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;While the current perspectives 
  of scientists, educators, legislators and business people are important, the 
  legitimacy and ultimately the public commitment to genetic research and technology 
  will also turn in large measure upon the experience, perceptions, and expressed 
  views of those whose lives are touched by the new discoveries and technologies. 
  The public will certainly approve interventions that promise good health, or 
  at least help to eliminate clear threats to health. However, the responses to 
  genetic interventions will be influenced by how we interpret risks and costs 
  and how we balance these options. This study explores these issues in relation 
  to some of the most widely implemented and rapidly proliferating interventions 
  arising out of molecular genetics – genetic testing.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;The term &quot;genetic 
  testing&quot; refers primarily to the practice of obtaining information on an 
  individual – oneself or even potential offspring – by analyzing DNA. Genetic 
  testing may be used predictively or diagnostically. When populations are targeted, 
  such testing is referred to as &quot;genetic screening.&quot; These processes 
  can identify a rapidly growing number of genetic conditions or alleles for such 
  conditions. However, even the most optimistic acknowledge that there currently 
  exists, and may be for some time, a long time gap between capacity to diagnose 
  and any possible therapeutic intervention. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are currently in a period 
  in which genetic tests can predict with varying degrees of accuracy the risk 
  for potentially lethal or debilitating genetic conditions from Tay Sachs and 
  Huntington’s disease to breast cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. Yet the therapeutic 
  interventions such a diagnosis permits are quite limited. Furthermore, diagnostic 
  tests are proliferating far more rapidly than effective treatments. In this 
  period of waiting for an effective intervention strategy, which could take many 
  years, a wide range of social, ethical, economic and legal issues surface for 
  medical and health practitioners and couples at risk for having a child with 
  a gene disorder. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These issues are being debated 
  from the perspective of a variety of experts, but far less attention has been 
  given to the perspective of the families at risk who must negotiate this increasingly 
  difficult terrain of both new and yet often still quite limited possibilities. 
  This project was conceived out of concern for the consequences of these developments 
  for families living with genetic disease, and/or at risk of genetic disorders. 
  We wished to provide a forum and even a megaphone, for the expression of these 
  experiences and viewpoints. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Often, current research 
  on responses to new biomedical technologies is conducted in medical centers. 
  Participants in such studies tend to be those who have already made the decision 
  to seek medical intervention of one form or another. Patients in these settings 
  are likely to have had multiple opportunities to interact with health care providers. 
  Medical-center patients learn to interact in a way that they view as appropriate 
  to the world of biomedicine. Their behavior and expressed views in this setting 
  are far less likely to accurately reflect the perspective they employ during 
  their everyday lives. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have chosen to focus 
  on sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis, recessive genetic conditions with 
  different clinical manifestations that affect different parts of the population. 
  We believe that this strategy gives us a window onto newly emerging social processes 
  and cultural issues that extend far beyond particular conditions and their uniqueness. 
  They help us to see how members of families integrate new genetic knowledge 
  into personal identities, mate selection, reproductive planning and other aspects 
  of private life. In this sense, the study’s participants and the processes they 
  reveal, are likely harbingers of things to come for the entire population. More 
  and more people will come to have the kinds of experiences we will describe 
  as scientists decode the genetic basis for an increasing number of conditions.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The discovery of the gene 
  for cystic fibrosis in 1989 provided a unique opportunity for social research. 
  Its discovery had long been anticipated since cystic fibrosis is the most common 
  genetic disorder among Americans of northern European descent. Cystic fibrosis, 
  however, was not the first serious disorder whose genetic basis scientists revealed. 
  Carrier testing for sickle cell disease goes back several decades (Bowman,1977; 
  Duster, 1990). These two conditions are the most common potentially lethal genetic 
  disorders within their respective populations. They not only have the same recessive 
  patterns of inheritance but also raise similarly serious biomedical challenges 
  and issues of information management. At the same time, each primarily affects 
  different racial and ethno-cultural group. This permitted us to observe and 
  analyze a naturally occurring &quot;experiment" in the variable penetration 
  and meaning of genetic medicine in two diverse populations.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As this report will show, 
  we have observed a wide range of responses to genetic testing, from resistance 
  or avoidance to vigilant utilization. Furthermore, these responses are clearly 
  patterned along a number of social, cultural and economic dimensions. Among 
  families at risk cystic fibrosis compared with those at risk for sickle cell 
  disease, there are significant differences as well as powerful similarities. 
  The major pattern we have observed, however, transcends ethnicity or genetic 
  condition and is counter-intuitive. We found that the closer people are to someone 
  with genetic disease, the more problematic and usually unacceptable genetic 
  testing is as a strategy for dealing with the issue. High-risk family members 
  who support genetic research do so primarily because they view it as leading 
  to better care and ultimately a cure, not because they support genetic testing 
  <I>per se</I>.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although more interest has 
  been exhibited in understanding why certain ethnic groups appear more resistant 
  to genetic testing than others, we believe the most important finding of our 
  study is the similar difficulties virtually all high-risk families have in integrating 
  the discourses of molecular genetics with the divergent values and priorities 
  of family life. In this report we will explain and elaborate on this finding. 
  </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Research Strategies</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Need for Combined 
  Methodologies.</b> Since the purpose of this project was to reveal cultural 
  and social-structural variations in perspectives on genetic testing, it was 
  necessary to use methods that would reveal as much as possible about the &quot;natural 
  attitude&quot; of the subjects. In other words, we wanted to discover and document 
  aspects of their particular social worlds, much of which we could not anticipate. 
  Such an approach demanded that we not impose academic or biomedical vocabularies 
  or vocabularies of motive upon our respondents that they did not bring to the 
  setting. Instead we wanted to use procedures that would give us optimal exposure 
  to the cognitive and emotional processes, cultural patterns, beliefs and practices 
  related to our respondents’ own life experiences. It became clear from our pilot 
  interviews that if we wanted people to be open with us it was important that 
  we avoid giving the impression that we were testing knowledge. Research methods 
  that explicitly test knowledge, are often useful and appropriate. Moreover, 
  the results of such investigations are certainly more easily analyzed. Respondents 
  attempt to provide the &quot;right&quot; answers. However, during such a process, 
  they are less likely to reveal their concerns, feelings or doubts. We elected 
  a combined approach of fieldwork (both observation and participant-observation), 
  semi-structured open-ended interviews with individuals, and group interviews.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Fieldwork.</b> &#9;Although 
  our goal was to reach beyond clinical settings, we began with several months 
  of extensive field work in hospitals and clinics. These included attending medical 
  rounds and conferences at two hospitals with large sickle cell clinics. We attended 
  cystic fibrosis rounds and conferences for clinicians at a third hospital. Occasionally 
  researchers sat in on patient counseling sessions. In all of these settings 
  we observed formal and informal social interaction among health care providers, 
  patients and family members, and took extensive field notes. These activities 
  enabled us to become knowledgeable about the workings of the clinics, increasing 
  our understanding of the diseases and their treatments, provider-patient interactions 
  and family relationships and responses to all of these. It also created allies 
  and informants for us among clinicians, and taught us what kinds of situations 
  and attitudes we should minimize or avoid.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A second focus of our field 
  work was non-medical settings. Members of our staff observed and participated 
  in social activities and benefits for both sickle cell and cystic fibrosis patients. 
  Such events included support group meetings, lay conferences, picnics, talent 
  shows, sporting events and children’s camps. This wide ranging exposure to the 
  social worlds of patients and their families enabled us to gain a more highly 
  textured picture of the concerns of patients and their families. It also prepared 
  us to recruit and interview in a more sensitive manner. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once our interviewers had 
  completed the requisite weeks of field work, they had also become acquainted 
  with health care providers and members of families we were targeting for our 
  study-- those in whom at least one member was known to have sickle cell or cystic 
  fibrosis. Nine of our staff members participated in local, national and international 
  conferences or meetings of geneticists, served on study sections for genetics-related 
  projects or served on panels and committees. While some of these meetings focused 
  on highly technical issues in molecular genetics, some focused on the intersections 
  between science and medicine or basic and applied science. These meetings gave 
  us a deeper understanding of the developments in genetics and of the differences 
  in perspectives among scientists, clinicians and patients and their families.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;<b>Recruitment and Sampling.</b> 
  Our first formal interviews were with mothers of young children with sickle 
  cell disease whom we met in clinical settings. Our sampling procedures<B> </B>combined 
  opportunity sampling to identify families; cascade sampling to move through 
  the family system, and theoretical sampling as we made efforts to include differing 
  types of families with wide ranging experiences in terms of income levels, education, 
  religion, severity of and proximity to the disease, and age of the affected 
  person. Our sample, therefore, while purposive rather than random, enabled us 
  to identify recurrent patterns and ranges of responses to genetic testing across 
  a wide band of social life. Where family members were located within traveling 
  distance (usually about 50 miles) and welcomed us into their homes, interviews 
  were conducted in person. Some interviews were also conducted in community sites, 
  community centers, churches, etc. When necessary, often because of distance, 
  we conducted interviews by telephone (34%<B> </B> were telephone interviews).</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;We interviewed 369 men 
  and women who have, or have had, a person with SCD or CF (or in some cases a 
  known carrier) in their family, and thus might be expected to have some concern 
  about issues of genetic testing. As Table One indicates, we were successful 
  in moving beyond the nuclear family with both disease groups, but significantly 
  more so in the cystic fibrosis families; 61% of CF respondents were extended 
  family members, compared with 33% of SC family members. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">[footnote: Our 
  first year of funded fieldwork and interviewing ended May 31,1993. During that 
  year we prepared much of the groundwork for recruitment of respondents and conducted 
  intensive interviews with 165 individuals in 40 families (See progress report 
  #1). From June 1, 1993 to March 4, 1994, we were forced to cut our operations 
  to a minimum due to a funding hiatus. However, the assistance of a supplementary 
  grant from DOE during that period enabled us to keep the project going with 
  only partial loss of trained staff. Based on a progress report renewal application 
  funding was then resumed at a level that permitted us to continue data collection 
  and move into data analysis. This second funding period ended October 31, 1995. 
  We were granted a one-year no-cost extension to October 31, 1995 and again in 
  1996 to give us more time for cataloguing and coding data for analysis.]</font></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Table 
  One not included in HTML version)</font> </b></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although several factors 
  help explain this difference in levels of response, the one most often articulated 
  was the greater mistrust among African Americans of university, and biomedical 
  researchers. Before considering this issue further, we need to explain our methods 
  in more detail.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">[footnote: We 
  tried to mitigate this with a general practice of matching interviewers and 
  interviewees by ethnicity and race]</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;There is a two-pronged 
  common misconception about &quot;qualitative methodology&quot; that should be 
  addressed and countered, which the research reported here confronts directly. 
  The first misconception is that qualitative methodology is either preliminary 
  or oppositional to quantitative analysis. The second is that social behavior 
  is so randomly distributed that a random sample is either the best or the only 
  way to obtain compelling evidence for apprehending patterns of behavior. Both 
  misconceptions are handled by the idea of &quot;the saturation of the categories.&quot;</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;After reviewing the 
  results of interviews with hundreds or even only scores of different subjects, 
  patterns always emerge in data collection; interviewers begin to report that 
  they have heard many other respondents give similar accounts. When analyzing 
  the data, the categories that emerge and become the basis for sorting responses 
  start to fill up. With more and more data collected, a routine phenomenon emerges, 
  &quot;the saturation of the categories&quot; (Glaser and Straus, 1967:107). 
  This is actually a quasi-quantitative rendering of what happens in &quot;qualitative&quot; 
  research. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">[footnote: Psychiatrists 
  who have practiced for several years are aware of this phenomenon, since they 
  report such things as "when it come down to it, there are only five stories 
  with variations around key themes."]</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;The effective use of 
  the saturation of the categories is assured not only by examination of a number 
  of cases, but through a procedure known as &quot;theoretical sampling.&quot; 
  As generalized relations among categories become discernible, hypotheses are 
  formulated and tested by actively looking for cases that do not necessarily 
  fit the emerging pattern. This strategy led us to search out the widest possible 
  range of respondents along a variety of dimensions. By asking our interviewees, 
  various informants, a member of the federal judiciary, university students and 
  custodial workers, we located families whose members came from of a wide range 
  of religious persuasions, economic statuses, and occupations. Our priorities 
  also included being alert to stories of individuals and families with a range 
  of values and experiences vis-&agrave;-vis genetic disease and technologies. 
  For example, in spite of the high correlation between these two conditions (CF 
  and SC) and ethnicity, our sample includes 11 African-Americans from families 
  with cystic fibrosis and two whites and two Mexican-Americans in the sickle 
  cell group.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;The process of achieving 
  category saturation during the sampling process clarifies some otherwise less 
  notable dimensions of the social world. For example, we noted a number of barriers 
  to participation in our research among African-American families, including 
  a markedly lower level of economic resources, which in turn reduced this population’s 
  interest in and willingness to participate in research. Enlisting their cooperation 
  was much more difficult. However, we were usually able to overcome these obstacles 
  using a variety of strategies. The first was to institute a policy of paying 
  respondents twenty dollars for their participation. We offered this to all respondents. 
  This not only made the potential interviewees more receptive, particularly the 
  poorest ones, but &quot;entitled&quot; our interviewers, who before being authorized 
  to offer this incentive, often reported being inhibited by a feeling that we 
  on the project were exploiting busy, beleaguered family members.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;A second important strategy 
  in the success of our overall recruitment efforts was the matching of interviewees 
  and respondents by race/ethnicity. For example, we found that interviewers of 
  African-American descent were much more successful in gaining the trust and 
  thus participation of African Americans and ultimately far more successful in 
  penetrating to other family members than were our white interviewers. White 
  interviewers were rarely able to interview more than one or two members of the 
  same family even with the twenty-dollar incentive. We also found that the interviews 
  conducted of African Americans by African Americans contained much more candid 
  and critical perspectives on a number of central issues than those white interviewers 
  conducted. The ability of the respondents to identify with interviewers by ethnicity 
  would become an issue later, as well, when we began interviewing Asian-American 
  families.&#9;</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;<B>Interviews. </B>We 
  developed an interview guide to assist our interviewers, who consisted of students 
  (mostly graduate) and senior staff members, in eliciting narratives related 
  to six general topic areas. Within these six areas, we developed a series of 
  open-ended probes that explored the specific terrain relevant to each interviewee:</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I. History of personal experience 
  with CF/SC </font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here the interviewer 
      would begin by asking how the respondent first learned about CF or SC and 
      follow through their entire personal history probing for appropriate details, 
      including thoughts and feelings and behavior in response to specific events 
      that the respondent described as significant. This section was designed 
      to lead into or overlap with other topics.</font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">II. Perspectives on the 
  disease</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here our intent was 
      to explore the respondent's beliefs about the meaning of the disorder in 
      the lives of those affected. We wanted to know what they regarded as the 
      best response to the threat of the disease, including their perspectives 
      on prevention and treatment.</font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">III. Genetic testing</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this section we hoped 
      to determine whether they were aware that testing was available and how 
      they felt about carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis.</font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">IV. Family communication</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also wanted to explore 
      family members' responses to CF/SC and carrier testing. We wondered how 
      they discuss it, how it comes up and what is said. We wanted to know about 
      siblings, parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, and about differences 
      in responses between men and women. </font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">V. Communication with friends 
  and acquaintances</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here we were interested 
      in whether they talk with people outside of the family about CF/SC, under 
      what conditions, and how they perceive the responses of others.</font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">VI. Health care</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We asked what their 
      and their family’s main concern is related to health care. We asked what, 
      if anything, they would change about their health care and whether they 
      have any concerns related to health insurance or coverage.</font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;It became clear early 
  in the process of interviewing that to the extent interviewers were intent on 
  getting answers to every possible question, the interviewers would often derail 
  the respondent from candid responses, or from revealing their own priorities. 
  Therefore, we made a strategic decision to sacrifice efficiency and consistency 
  of form for validity. That is, we attempted to allow maximum latitude for respondents 
  to frame the issues and express them in their own way. We encouraged them to 
  talk about those issues that were most salient for them rather than spending 
  significant amounts of time on issues that they may not have considered. This 
  decision arose partly from the experience of participating in previous research 
  projects dealing with sensitive subject matter, in which it is only after the 
  official interview is over and the tape recorders are turned off that respondents 
  often begin to tell researchers what is really on their minds. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;We were encouraged in 
  our efforts toward a more informal and flexible approach by some of our least 
  formally educated African-American respondents who indicated, sometimes more 
  directly than many other respondents, that they would tell us only what they 
  wanted to tell us. This was best exemplified in the frank formulation of a 63 
  year-old grandmother of a child with sickle cell disease. After initially hesitating 
  to consent to an interview, she said: &quot;Okay, come right now, and don’t 
  ask me any questions, just let me tell you what I know.&quot; </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;The more personal style 
  of interviewing we adopted, while more time consuming and difficult to analyze, 
  often results in more candid and honest responses as the interview takes the 
  form of a supportive and very personal conversation. Even with an informal and 
  open-ended interviewing style, the interviewer always faced a challenge in gaining 
  the trust of the respondent -- shifting the context from a formal, technical 
  and impersonal exchange to a more intimate one. When confronted with the subject 
  of genetic disease, particularly by university researchers, respondents often 
  begin by engaging in a somewhat formal and impersonal discourse. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;We developed a number 
  of strategies to encourage respondents to go beyond this "official presentation 
  of self" and to reveal the experience of their private worlds. These efforts 
  have paid off by giving us personal accounts that are often more emotionally 
  charged and inconsistent with the front-stage public exchanges. It is from this 
  interplay of front and backstage discourses of family members that the current 
  analysis emerges.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;<B>Focus groups. </B>We 
  began conducting focus groups in the third year of the study. Group interviews 
  can serve a variety of purposes. The focus group interview is a well-established 
  technique for identifying the range and patterns of opinions, attitudes, values 
  and feelings on specific topics (Bellinger, Bernhardt and Goldstucker, 1976; 
  Hedges, 1975; Merton, Fiske &amp; Kendall, 1956; Morgan, 1988; Morgan and Spanish, 
  1984), but our intent was somewhat different and is based on the previous work 
  of our Principal Investigator (Duster, 1990). Our goals were to verify the authenticity 
  and salience of themes that emerged from the individual interviews. We were 
  well aware that the most sensitive of individual interview techniques involve 
  assessments on the part of the interviewees as to what the interviewer’s perspective 
  and interests are and varying degrees of editing of the respondent’s remarks 
  to conform to those expectations. Duster’s (1990) work made it clear that we 
  would most likely get the clearest articulations of those perspectives by creating 
  contexts in which individuals who shared particular relationships to the conditions 
  under study (homogeneous groups) outnumbered interviewers. In other words, their 
  shared experience was most likely to find its purest voice in settings in which 
  it was the dominant perspective and the audience was perceived as empathetic. 
  It was precisely these cultural dimensions of the issues we wanted to highlight. 
  </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;This aspect of the process, 
  although cumbersome to arrange, provided some of the richest data in the study. 
  We assembled 15 focus groups, each of which were homogeneous by race and with 
  regard to CF or SC, and stratified around key social dimensions (primarily relationship 
  to a person with the disease). For example, some groups consisted only of mothers 
  of an affected person, others only fathers, or siblings, or grandparents. The 
  groups ranged in size from 3 to 8 participants.</font></P>

</TABLE>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our sickle cell groups were 
  all led by African-American staff members. The cystic fibrosis groups were led 
  by white team members or a black and white team. We found that the supportive 
  atmosphere of these focus groups brought forth intense and animated interaction 
  among participants. It was quite common for respondents to linger and continue 
  their discussion after the researchers indicated that the time planned for the 
  group had run out. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;Our goal here was somewhat 
  different than the more common uses of focus groups in which individual responses 
  are analyzed. Instead we focused on the emergent properties of the discussion. 
  In this setting we found that certain themes emerged as particularly salient 
  and emotionally charged. This occurred with a force and clarity that was often 
  less apparent in individual interviews in which the individual lacked the support 
  or reinforcement of others who shared the same experience. Examples of charged 
  themes that clearly emerged in this context were: anger and frustration about 
  problems getting insurance coverage and reimbursements (especially among CF 
  families), mistrust of government, science and medicine (among African-American 
  SC families), and preoccupation with treatment issues (among mothers, caretakers 
  and affected adults of both groups).</font></P>
<P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Ethical Issues</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Semi-structured interviews 
  as a research tool pose different, and often more complex kinds of ethical issues 
  than questionnaires or pre-coded interview schedules. The three issues that 
  were most salient were related to recruitment of respondents, confidentiality, 
  and misinformation on the part of respondents.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;<B>Recruitment of respondents. 
  </B>The first issue arose early in the study when we began attempting to recruit 
  mothers of children with sickle cell disease from a hospital clinic. It was 
  apparent to our interviewers that these women were having a difficult struggle 
  to meet the demands of everyday life and the needs of their children with sickle 
  cell as well as the needs of their other children. To ask them to participate 
  in an interview that required a significant time commitment and perhaps even 
  transportation and child care often seemed insensitive and unreasonable.&#9;</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;Our observations of 
  the obvious inconvenience to our respondents of lengthy interviews led us to 
  the decision noted above, to offer twenty dollars to interviewees as compensation 
  for these impositions. This offer increased the willingness to be interviewed 
  for many and reduced the sense of the interviewers that they were imposing on 
  interviewees. In view of the often highly emotional nature of the interviews, 
  we decided to pursue interviewees only gently, and to accept repeated evasions 
  as an indication of reluctance to participate.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;<B>Confidentiality. 
  </B>We noted early in the study that members of a family often have markedly 
  different interpretations of major family events and may make harsh judgments 
  of each other. Often family members are aware of these differences. This meant 
  that the most highly-conflicted families were the ones in which recruiting study 
  participants was most difficult and confidentiality was a constant concern.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;The issue of confidentiality 
  was particularly sensitive in this study since we often had a broad spectrum 
  of information about our respondents and their relationships. We often found 
  ourselves knowing more about what relatives think about other members of their 
  family, or the choices they have made, than some family members knew. By the 
  time we interviewed more than one family member we often had information about 
  feelings or events that could have been disruptive if revealed to another family 
  member. In one family, for example, our first interviewee was a woman whose 
  affected child with CF was not her husband’s. In another case a mother of a 
  child with CF would not refer us to any relatives because two family members 
  living with CF kept their diagnoses secret from their employers. One of them 
  was keeping this information from clients because he believed this was necessary 
  for success in his profession. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some adults were open about 
  their CF or sickle cell, but did not want it to become any more of an issue 
  than necessary with other family members. We dealt with these issues by establishing 
  a policy of never referring to the content of other interviews and constantly 
  reminding ourselves and each other of the sensitivity of our situation. It required 
  constant vigilance not to inadvertently divulge information one family member 
  provided to another. We could usually get more interviews per family if the 
  same person interviewed all of them, most assuredly in those cases where the 
  family came to like and trust interviewers who reappeared periodically to interview 
  others who shared a household or neighborhood. We also found that interviewers 
  could get better information if they stayed with the same family. They could 
  ask about issues they learned about from other interviewers without divulging 
  the specific knowledge on which the question was based. Since many of these 
  family stories were dramatic and painful this often exerted enormous emotional 
  pressure on the interviewers necessitating lengthy debriefing sessions and flexibility 
  in scheduling interviews. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;Since each family is 
  unique and many family stories that reveal tensions would be recognizable to 
  its members if described comprehensively, and since secrets that family members 
  keep from other family members are common, reporting on family dynamics is potentially 
  very dangerous to family relationships. This concern for confidentiality or 
  secrecy by respondents sometimes interrupted our cascade sampling when family 
  members declined to refer us to others. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sometimes when the interviewer 
  was able to get a referral, we declined to follow up on it for ethical reasons. 
  One such case involved a young man with a mild case of cystic fibrosis. In a 
  delicate and emotional interview, he told the interviewer about how difficult 
  it had been for him, after four months of a relationship, to finally reveal 
  to his first serious girlfriend that he had cystic fibrosis. He was very relieved 
  that she did not reject him. Interviewing her could have been very helpful in 
  understanding issues young people face in dealing with disclosure about genetic 
  disease in the context of negotiating intimate relationships. The interviewer 
  cautiously explored the idea with the young man, and he was willing to ask his 
  girlfriend if she would consent to participate in the study. However, on reflection, 
  it was clear to the interviewer that the impact of the interview on the girlfriend’s 
  perceptions of the significance of his condition might be greater than the young 
  man anticipated. The interviewer felt an ethical obligation to decline to interview 
  her and told him she decided it really wasn’t necessary, since she wasn’t really 
  a family member. The senior staff supported this decision on ethical grounds. 
  </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;<B>Misinformation. </B>We 
  had to be aware that even when family members gave referrals freely, they could 
  have consequences the family members did not anticipate. For example, occasionally 
  we would come upon a respondent who was not aware that cystic fibrosis or sickle 
  cell was an inherited disorder, or they had grossly incorrect information about 
  the consequences of these conditions. Our strategy was primarily to listen. 
  When asked for information, we reiterated that we were not physicians or genetic 
  counselors, and we made referrals to medical or patient advocacy sources. At 
  the same time, we felt it would be unethical to withhold basic information about 
  these conditions that was common knowledge among the more informed, particularly 
  when they asked us directly. For example, we would occasionally run into people 
  who assumed that these conditions were invariably fatal at an early age. On 
  those occasions, we would point out that recent advances had improved the prognosis 
  and suggest a source of up-to-date information.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;These were not the only 
  ethical issues we confronted. We made decisions not to pursue an interview on 
  occasions when potential respondents warned researchers that their neighborhoods 
  were not safe for outsiders. These choices sometimes conflicted with the goals 
  of the research project. At times this meant pulling interviewers out of the 
  field because they felt emotionally overwhelmed by the suffering they were being 
  exposed to as a result of the diseases or poverty of some of the families.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><b>Quantitative and Demographic Description of Respondents</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">&#9;This project has yielded a rich mapping of the social 
  and cultural patterns of family life as it relates to new genetic knowledge 
  and to certain genetic disorders. Our work can be likened to the mapping of 
  the human genome in that we have identified a number of significant features 
  of the terrain and have laid the groundwork for continued, more detailed analysis. 
  In order to understand these patterns, it is helpful to consider some of the 
  demographics of our sample. Table Three indicates that the educational level 
  of our sickle cell and cystic fibrosis respondents is comparable, with a modal 
  educational level of &quot;some college&quot; for both groups. The cystic fibrosis 
  families had somewhat more members with graduate school education and fewer 
  who were not high school graduates.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">&#9;The relatively small differences in educational level 
  stand in marked contrast to the sharp differences in income. Rather than mirroring 
  the similar educational patterns we find that the modal income level for the 
  sickle cell families is under $10,000, our lowest income category, while the 
  modal income level for the cystic fibrosis families is over $50,000, our highest 
  income category. The contrasting patterns can be seen by comparing Tables Three 
  and Four.</font></P>
<P><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Tables Three and Four 
  not included in HTML version)</font> </b></P>
<P><font face="Arial">&#9;Attitudes toward participating in research differed 
  sharply between the two groups. This was apparent in the greater difficulty 
  we experienced in recruiting participants from sickle cell families, their greater 
  difficulty fitting interviews into their schedules without interruption once 
  they had agreed, and the higher levels of suspicion and cynicism about biomedical 
  research conveyed during the interviews. All of these were factors in the greater 
  proportion of extended family members we were able to gain access to in the 
  cystic fibrosis as opposed to sickle cell families which Table One illustrates.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">We found interesting differences in willingness to be interviewed 
  not only by ethnic group, but by gender as well. Women were much more deeply 
  involved in the day-to-day care of disabled children than men in either ethnic 
  group. This was reflected in their disproportionate presence in medical clinics 
  and advocacy organizations and greater willingness to talk with us about these 
  matters. We were reminded in a wide variety of ways that the issue of genetic 
  disease is a far more difficult topic for men than for women. Men seem to feel 
  greater shame about their association with deleterious genes and greater reluctance 
  to believe they could carry genetic disorders. When they learn they are carriers 
  of a deleterious gene, they tend to be more reluctant to communicate that information 
  to us or to potential partners.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">&#9;African-American men were less accessible to us as potential 
  interviewees (see Table Five) than African-American women or white men. This 
  is partly due to the higher proportion of single mothers in this ethnic group, 
  but it may also reflect the greater mistrust of—and alienation from—the health 
  care system by black men. The interviews with African American men, particularly 
  in focus groups, revealed far more mistrust and cynicism about health care, 
  medicine and science than we found among the predominantly white men or women 
  of either group.</font></P>

<P><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;</font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Within 
  each cultural group we found clearly discernible class and familial variations

  to the challenges that genetic disease and genetic testing presented. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Respondents’ Experience 
  with Genetic Testing Quantified</font></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Carrier Testing. One aspect 
  of the respondents’ relationship to genetic testing is easily quantified -- 
  their genetic status. By this term we mean to indicate their perception of whether 
  or not they are directly affected by deleterious genes. In the case of recessive 
  conditions such as CF and SC this usually corresponds with whether they are 
  homozygous for the condition, carriers or tested non-carriers. In a very few 
  cases (6 SC and 3 CF), respondents provided contradictory or obviously incorrect 
  information or could not remember whether or not they were carriers.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A much greater proportion 
  of the sickle cell respondents compared with the CF respondents have undergone 
  genetic testing and thus know their carrier status (Table Six). This difference 
  is indicated by the fact that &quot;unknown&quot; is the largest category for 
  carrier status among CF family members, and the larger numbers in both the &quot;carrier&quot; 
  and &quot;tested non-carrier&quot; categories for SC. These proportions are 
  consistent both with the longer history of sickle cell carrier testing and the 
  fact that we reached more extended family members in the CF group. More of those 
  who were tested in the sickle cell group turned out to be carriers than tested 
  CF respondents, which we expected given the greater prevalence of the mutation 
  at issue in that population.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Table 
  Six not included in HTML version)</font> </b></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We found only 
  eight individuals who have been identified as CF carriers through genetic testing 
  as opposed to through diagnosis of their offspring with genetic disease. We 
  will discuss the processes that led to their being tested below.</font></P>
<div align="left"> </div>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Prenatal Diagnosis and 
  Selective Abortion.</b> We found fourteen women reporting the use of prenatal 
  diagnosis in each group. This constitutes a smaller proportion of the African-American 
  women than the white women. However, this figure tells us very little about 
  significant differences in the reasons for undergoing such procedures or about 
  differences in attitudes toward selective abortion. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;We can see hints of 
  these differences in the fact that it was only in the CF families, where we 
  found two cases, that selective abortion actually occurred after undergoing 
  prenatal diagnosis. In the first case prenatal diagnosis was offered primarily 
  as a result of the birth of a previous child with CF. This couple had made a 
  decision they would abort if this fetus had CF. The fetus was found to be free 
  of CF but diagnosed with Down syndrome, and the pregnancy was terminated. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;The other selective 
  abortion for CF occurred in a family that already had two previous children 
  with CF. The couple wanted a healthy child and planned to keep the pregnancy 
  a secret from family members and friends until after the amniocentesis could 
  assure them the baby would be free of CF. They chose abortion when they learned 
  the fetus was affected. This couple later went on to have another pregnancy 
  in which it was determined the fetus was not affected. They continued this pregnancy 
  and now consider their family complete.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;African-American family 
  members typically disapprove of the use of selective abortion, particularly 
  for themselves, but CF families very often reject selective abortion as an appropriate 
  option. Twenty African-American mothers of children with sickle cell (and no 
  fathers) reported they were aware that they carried the sickle cell gene before 
  the birth of an affected child, yet did not intervene to prevent this from occurring. 
  Mothers were aware of a risk in only three families that had biological children 
  with CF. One family chose to adopt a second child with CF some time after learning 
  their first child (who was also adopted) had the condition. These numbers tell 
  us very little about the meaning of genetic disorders and new genetic technologies 
  in the lives of our respondents, but they do suggest that the patterns of response 
  among high-risk families are often not what would be expected from a purely 
  biomedical perspective. They also provide a partial framework for understanding 
  the meanings of genetic disorders and new genetic technologies in the lives 
  of our respondents. We will discuss some of the reasons for such responses in 
  the next section.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Cultural Differences 
  and Cultural Issues: Context and Meaning </b></font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;The differences between 
  CF and SC respondents in relation to genetic testing, as the preceding tables 
  suggest, are numerous, complex and multifaceted. Both racial-ethnic groups display 
  a variety of characteristics and responses that reflect their differing economic 
  positions, cultural heritages and the unique challenges of a particular disease. 
  Nevertheless, they have much in common. Our most significant findings do not 
  involve the pronounced differences between the perspectives of the two groups, 
  but rather larger cultural conflicts that both cystic fibrosis and sick cell 
  families must negotiate – the conflict between the diagnosis and communication 
  of molecular or genetic information and the context in which that information 
  is delivered inside families.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;Diagnosis of a life-threatening 
  genetic disorder, or the identification of a gene that could cause such a disorder, 
  has dramatically different meanings for family members and for those who approach 
  it from the perspective of molecular genetics. For the latter there is the analytic 
  power of science brought to bear upon a human problem -- the tracking and decoding, 
  the probe to the molecular level that from the perspective of family life strips 
  away other contexts -- with the usually corresponding hope that this information 
  will enhance the health and the lives of those who receive it. For the family 
  members, however, the cold, hard, scientific facts -- the &quot;neutral&quot; 
  information -- are never neutral because they are never without social context. 
  The nature and character of that context varies from family to family, from 
  genetic disease to genetic disease, by ethnic and racial group, by religious 
  and cultural group, and by gender and social class. These contextual differences 
  place genetic testing in somewhat different perspectives. But one thing is common 
  to all family members who confront a genetic disorder or risk thereof -- <i>the 
  vigorous insistence on recontextualizing what they view as a decontextualized 
  genetic diagnosis.</i></font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;Three key dimensions 
  of the recontextualizing that individuals inevitably indicate concern with are 
  family unity, personal identity, and social standing. These are aspects of culture 
  that CF and SC respondents have in common that make genetic testing problematic 
  as well as sometimes useful and empowering. After discussing these shared concerns 
  we will examine some key differences.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;<b>Family Unity.</b> 
  The family is by definition a collective. When information about deleterious 
  genes is introduced into families where one or more members is known to be disabled 
  by the condition, the character of that collectivity is often notably altered, 
  and sometimes vitally threatened. This is because for these families deleterious 
  genes are interlaced with deep cultural meaning, and are never just abstract 
  concepts. Not only are they embodied, they are unequally distributed among individuals 
  who previously saw their family membership as something they shared equally 
  with their kin. A previously shared legacy is suddenly redefined in a way that 
  emphasizes a new kind of difference among family members, identifying some as 
  having fundamental "defects", and perhaps as having passed them on, or as potentially 
  dangerous to their own offspring, while other members may be certified as free 
  of such liabilities. This definition of the situation introduces classifications 
  into the family that, however practical for appropriate medical treatment, are 
  likely to be disruptive of previous relationships. When family members refuse 
  to integrate genetic information into partner selection or reproductive planning, 
  some professionals characterize this as &quot;denial.&quot; But this characterization 
  obscures more than it reveals.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;Historically, most health 
  problems have been understood to be the result of threats from outside the family. 
  Genetic disease, on the other hand, identifies a child’s parents as the source 
  of the problem. Indeed, children sometimes refer to their condition as "a disease 
  my parents gave me." By identifying the source of the disease in the parents' 
  biological makeup, issues of guilt and blame surface. Usually these feelings 
  are displayed inadvertently, rather than deliberately. Guilt and blame are sometimes 
  acknowledged openly, but more often the admission of such feelings is accompanied 
  by the claim that they were part of an adjustment process in the past, but are 
  no longer a serious problem. A mother of a child with sickle cell was somewhat 
  more explicit in voicing these feelings than some others when she stated:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I feel responsible and 
      his dad feels the same way. It's like we have done something. We have shamed 
      ourselves real bad, but you just have to deal with it. Society puts people 
      down about a whole lot of things. I feel they look upon me as though I'm 
      nasty. You know, they don't take kindly when you do something to a child. 
      </font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fathers seem to have special 
  difficulty accepting their role in their child's disorder. This may even lead 
  them to question (how genuinely we do not know) whether they are in fact the 
  biological father. A more constructive response was expressed by one father 
  who refused to have his identity spoiled by genetic information. He insisted: 
  </font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What makes me a good 
      parent is not whether or not my child is perfect, but what I'm able to do 
      to help her.</font></P>
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;</font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The recontextualization 
  of genetic information is something that all families do. It typically becomes 
  an occasion to re-examine some taken-for-granted assumptions about one’s identity 
  or the meaning of relationships.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;Because neither clinicians 
  nor parents seem to anticipate the potential social significance of such information, 
  carrier children are sometimes informed which parent's defective gene they have 
  received (and thus are at risk of passing on to their own children). Children 
  with disease, who have received one mutated gene from each parent, are sometimes 
  (and apparently this is occurring with increasing frequency) informed which 
  parent's cystic fibrosis or hemoglobinopathy gene scientists believe to be most 
  lethal. The assignment of blame and culpability and the resulting guilt and 
  shame all lurk as part of the recontextualization.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;The similarities or 
  distinctions in genotypes among children become </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">salient 
  as well. Parents indicate the distribution of disease and trait and this information 
  can create divisions within the family. For example, one woman was diagnosed 
  with CF several years before she was genotyped. One of her alleles is a Delta-F-508, 
  the other is unknown. In referring to the second allele, she says, &quot;I call 
  it my good gene. It’s like the one that sort of alleviates whatever the Delta 
  F508 does.&quot; She never learned which parent gave her which mutation, but 
  increasingly this information is available and must be interpreted by family 
  members who are unable to abstractly &quot;partial it out&quot; from their social 
  relations. In one family a child was told that the mutation he received from 
  his father was the more destructive one.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;The opportunities for 
  casting blame are more obvious in the case of grandparents because they are 
  not equally implicated in their grandchild’s condition. The neutral, technical 
  purpose of testing them is to determine which branch of the family is at greatest 
  risk. Nonetheless, testing invariably turns out to be a source of considerable 
  distress for grandparents. Their first reaction to the news is usually to deny 
  that any such condition has ever existed on their side of the family. In one 
  case the grandmother who was tested and found not to be a carrier was sworn 
  to secrecy by her husband. This nullified the ostensible purpose of her test, 
  which was to learn which side of the family should be alerted. Many resist testing 
  because they anticipate difficulty living with the knowledge that they contributed, 
  however innocently, to their grandchild's illness. As one grandmother asked:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whose fault was it? 
      Was it mine or my husband's?...I'd like to know which one -- who carries 
      the gene; my husband or I. But on the other hand, maybe it's good I don't 
      know. </font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our data suggest that these 
  feelings of blame and shame for being what several families call "the culprit" 
  will proliferate with an increased capacity to identify a particular &quot;imperfection&quot; 
  via genetic analysis. A sense of responsibility for the child's suffering is 
  something few parents or grandparents can avoid. Humans <I>insist</I> on giving 
  meaning to new information, particularly when so much social interaction focuses 
  on gathering it. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;The issue of family 
  unity takes on a somewhat different cast depending on some of the families’ 
  other values. Families that are more religious and traditional have a greater 
  level of comfort and acceptance of premarital carrier testing, but are often 
  extremely uncomfortable with and reject prenatal diagnosis. On the other hand, 
  couples that are more egalitarian, highly educated and not particularly religious 
  have fewer reservations about prenatal diagnosis. Both of these types of couples 
  may resist carrier testing before marriage because they see it as a violation 
  of their commitment to the concept of romantic love. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;<b>Self-Identity and 
  Partner Selection.</b> Another key element of genetic testing is the impact 
  it can have on the self-identity of the person affected, often related to the 
  life stage of the individual tested. When testing occurs in infancy it becomes 
  a pivotal focus in defining the child’s future and relationship with the parents. 
  Testing is viewed as a powerful indicator of who the child will become and what 
  his or her future may hold. Results of genetic tests sometimes have welcome 
  consequences, insofar as they facilitate a correct diagnosis and thus point 
  to treatment options that might not have been utilized otherwise. Genetic diagnosis 
  brings relief when the parents, usually the mothers, are being blamed for their 
  child’s problems. For example, before receiving a correct diagnosis of cystic 
  fibrosis one mother (149) was told that the problems her infant was experiencing 
  were due to her being an overly nervous mother, and that something was wrong 
  with her milk supply. In this case, the genetic test provided an explanation 
  (CF) that made her feel less guilty and incompetent as a mother, and facilitated 
  more appropriate treatment for the malnutrition and dehydration that posed an 
  immediate threat to her child's life. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;Genetic testing to confirm 
  the diagnosis can be a relief to parents when it indicates to medical practitioners 
  and other authorities that a child's self-report of pain is due to sickle cell 
  disease and not, for example, physical abuse, inadequate care or hypochondria, 
  all of which are frequently suspected. It may also point to specific treatment 
  strategies that families find more effective than those resulting from other 
  explanations for symptoms. Thus many psycho-social benefits of genetic testing 
  are related to diagnosis of full-blown disease.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;While there is a full 
  range of responses, the first diagnosis of sickle cell or cystic fibrosis in 
  a family is typically received as devastating news. Family members repeatedly 
  report being told that their child will not live to adulthood, along with other 
  similar prognoses that have very often proven unduly pessimistic. In one family 
  we interviewed an adult who as a child with asthma and allergies was misdiagnosed 
  with CF. This diagnosis caused her mother to give up hope for her daughter’s 
  future. Today, the adult daughter is very resentful that major decisions about 
  her life were made under the erroneous assumption that she would die young:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It very much affected 
      my relationship with her [mother]. She was always acting like I was going 
      to die and she made decisions about my life as if I was about to die all 
      the time. </font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This case is of theoretical 
  interest because even though the diagnosis of CF eventually was proven incorrect, 
  its social consequences remained significant. One could argue that such mistakes 
  are much less likely where DNA testing is available. However, we have found 
  adults with mild cases of CF or SC who were grateful they were not diagnosed 
  sooner, because they managed to receive symptomatic treatment while living a 
  &quot;more normal life&quot; and maintaining an &quot;unspoiled&quot; social 
  identity. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;The predictive aspect 
  of genetic testing in the context of a struggle to make a rewarding life is 
  rarely interpreted as enhancing one's power. Genetic testing, as a practice, 
  is not necessarily welcome. This is particularly true when it removes or sharply 
  diminishes one of the main resources in care giving -- hope. In response to 
  learning about the accuracy of DNA diagnosis, a mother explained:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A mother is someone 
      who loves the child and doesn't want to hear all this stuff about his limitations. 
      I don't want to hear what's going to happen down the road as if its all 
      laid out, because I couldn't take good care of him under those conditions.</font></P>
   </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The knowledge that one is 
  a carrier of a potentially fatal genetic disorder takes on particular significance 
  when it arises in young adulthood during or before the quest for a life partner. 
  Medically this is one of the least controversial uses of genetic testing. Respondents 
  may claim to favor the idea that carriers should have their partners tested. 
  However, their actual behavior and the behavior of other family members makes 
  it clear that there is a strong undercurrent of resistance to carrier testing. 
  While the active and outspoken objection is apparent among a minority of respondents, 
  more implicit indications of discomfort with genetic testing are frequently 
  expressed. A typical response is the failure to take any action, even a telephone 
  call, to inquire about proceeding to get tested.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;One’s desirability as 
  a potential partner is one of the most powerful issues in personal identity 
  and biography in our culture, and the idea of romantic love is pervasive. Respondents 
  in both sickle cell and CF samples find carrier testing a troubling, even deeply 
  disturbing real counter to the dominant image of self and other as romantic 
  love objects.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Evidence abounds that even 
  when individuals have been tested and are found to be carriers (often this occurs 
  at birth in the case of sickle cell due to newborn testing programs), this does 
  not necessarily lead to the integration of this knowledge into partner selection 
  or future childbearing decisions. Often those who have been tested for sickle 
  cell trait reject the relevance and implications of testing in choosing a partner. 
  Sometimes results are forgotten. More often carriers simply fail to communicate 
  their carrier status to prospective mates. One young woman indicated her distaste 
  for the idea of using carrier testing as a factor in mate selection when she 
  compared the idea to "breeding dogs." Another young woman explained:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Genetic problems can't 
      be prevented because sometimes you don't plan a baby. They just happen. 
      You can't do anything about it unless you say, "Before I sleep with you 
      I want to get you screened," and it don't work that way, not in reality.</font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;Our data support a recent 
  report of related research by Hill (1994:29-47), who also found widespread resistance 
  to integrating sickle cell testing into mate selection. She describes this response 
  in the African-American communities she studied as "obfuscation of SCD medical 
  knowledge" and attributes it to SCD's threat to motherhood and the distinctive 
  consciousness the material realities of life engender for Black women. Our findings 
  are consistent with hers, but we would emphasize that this attitude exists not 
  only among African Americans, but among European Americans as well. The reasons 
  for this resistance are deeply rooted shared values about the affective nature 
  of close human relations as opposed to their instrumental significance.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;This refusal to consider 
  one's partner's carrier status is consistent with the ideology of "romantic 
  love" -- the most socially approved justification for modern marriage and for 
  sexual activity. Respondents routinely declared that "if they truly loved someone," 
  they would marry them despite the fact that they both might be carriers, and 
  that "if it’s real love, you can overcome things like that."</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;For example, before 
  the availability of carrier testing, one of our male respondents hesitated to 
  marry a woman known to be a carrier because she had previously borne a child 
  with cystic fibrosis. He eventually went ahead with the marriage because he 
  decided that "marriage should be for love." In myriad ways respondents make 
  it clear that they view the use of carrier testing as a factor in partner selection 
  as incompatible with what impels them to have a relationship, the expressed 
  experience of love.<I> </I>&#9;</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;Once the crucial decision 
  of choice of a mate has been made, genetic testing has direct relevance for 
  reproductive planning. Most frequently this occurs around the issue of prenatal 
  diagnosis. Highly educated, and higher income, non-religious contemporary couples 
  are more likely and more willing than traditional, religious, working-class 
  or lower-class couples to consider prenatal testing and selective abortion in 
  hopes of avoiding the birth of children with serious disorders than they are 
  to demand or expect carrier testing of prospective partners as part of mate 
  selection. Yet, even among the most highly educated high-risk families we studied, 
  we found significant resistance to selective abortion. Few parents in our sample 
  expressed a willingness to use this method of preventing the birth of an affected 
  child, and only one couple in the DF families actually did selectively abort 
  a CF fetus. Interestingly, this resistance to selective abortion does not appear 
  to reflect a rejection of abortion, per se. We found seven members of sickle 
  cell families who reported they had had abortions, but none of these were related 
  to prenatal diagnosis. Only one of these involved fear of sickle cell, but this 
  abortion was not the result of genetic testing. Rather it was an abortion obtained 
  by a teenager, who did not even know her carrier status. Because of her family 
  history, she feared her child would be affected, but she did not know the carrier 
  status of her partner. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">[ footnote: This 
  is consistent with the work of Wertz, et al (1992:1077-1085), who found that 
  only twenty percent of parents of children with CF say they would abort for 
  CF in the first trimester; 54 percent would not have an abortion for CF.]</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;Respondents from both 
  the CF and SC groups often told us that although they were politically "pro-choice," 
  they would not themselves abort an affected child. The experience of emotional 
  closeness to someone with a genetic disease reduces, rather than increases, 
  the acceptability of selective abortion. A close relationship with an affected 
  person appears to make it more difficult to evaluate the meaning or worth of 
  that person's existence solely in terms of their disease. Family members consistently 
  affirm the value of the person's life in spite of the disorder, and see value 
  for their family in their experiences with (and of) this member, and in meeting 
  the challenges the disease poses. For example, a woman whose sister had died 
  of cystic fibrosis told us:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If any one of us were 
      pregnant and it was clear that we were carrying a child with cystic fibrosis 
      we knew we would bring it to term. We wouldn't have wished that Sally not 
      be born, and the thought of not having a child because this child shared 
      something that Sally had -- it just creates such cognitive dissonance in 
      my mind that I don't even know what to make of it. </font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At another point in the 
  interview she explains:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I understand how someone 
      without the experience of my family could think that children need to be 
      perfect or else they're miserable, or we do a disservice in having them, 
      but it's never been part of my expectation that people are perfect, or that 
      perfect health means perfect happiness. I've just never equated goodness 
      or life meaning with perfection, and so even though I know intellectually 
      that I should be in a better position to understand the argument that one 
      shouldn't be born unless one is quote unquote perfect, but it makes no sense 
      to me.</font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;Even when respondents 
  indicate they are in favor of genetic testing, they often have difficulty accepting 
  the possibility of selective abortion. In response to a question on the topic 
  of prenatal diagnosis, one such respondent was asked, &quot;What would your 
  children do with this information?&quot; She replied:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My feeling is that both 
      of them, even if they knew they were pregnant with a child with cystic fibrosis 
      they would go ahead and have the child. They've certainly seen Brian grow 
      up and function well with the disease. They realize he is just a normal 
      kid. He's mentally healthy and he's physically able to do things. I would 
      hope that they would go ahead and have the baby. </font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Members of families in 
  which there has been a diagnosis of a gene disorder make it clear that the issue 
  of genetic testing or selective abortion cannot be considered without reference 
  to the family member with the condition in question. The stronger the bond with 
  the affected person, the less likely one is to favor prenatal testing and selective 
  abortion. In some cases, highly educated individuals close to persons with CF 
  seemed to have no trouble integrating their commitment to a person with CF and 
  the idea of selective abortion, but we found no cases where such a decision 
  was contemplated in practice (as opposed to hypothetically) without a high level 
  of personal conflict.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;Even the case of a couple 
  whose first child had CF, and who subsequently chose to terminate a fetus diagnosed 
  with CF in a second pregnancy illustrates this conflict. They were very careful 
  to shield themselves emotionally as much as possible. They used a number of 
  strategies for doing this. One was keeping the pregnancy a secret, particularly 
  from other families that had children with CF. A second was by learning as little 
  as possible about the fetus other than whether or not it was affected. The woman 
  explained:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We chose not to find 
      out what the sex was. I was trying not to perceive that fetus as a child. 
      But having been a pregnancy it was hard to not think of this one as a somebody, 
      you know with a personality. </font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the abortion was done 
  at 12 weeks she requested general anesthetic despite the fact that it was not 
  medically necessary. Months after the birth of a subsequent healthy child, this 
  mother still has conflicts and concerns about how to handle this information 
  within the family. She explains these this way:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[H]ow will I- at some 
      time I want to be able to present all this [to the children], too. How the 
      whole context of all this affected them . . . that they might have had another 
      sibling that we chose not to do that. Because I think that’ s important 
      at some point. . . It’s going to be hard because I don’t know how they’ll 
      respond.</font></P>

</DIR>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;<b>External Forces<I>.</I></b><I> 
  </I> The third dimension of the recontextualization that individuals engage 
  in has to do with the meaning of genetic disorders in the context of the family’s 
  relationship with the larger society. This dimension includes the flow of economic, 
  social and cultural resources between the family and the society. It is here 
  that the incentives for prenatal diagnosis and selective abortion are greatest.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The issue of access to health 
  care arose in the interviews in several ways. Sometimes respondents introduced 
  it as they told the stories of their encounters with genetic disease, and efforts 
  to get effective care for their family member. Other times they raised the issue 
  in response to a question about who should have access to genetic test results. 
  This was a question that often evoked references to insurance companies. The 
  most typical form in which the topic was broached was under the general topic 
  of health care, in response to the question, &quot;What is your main concern 
  related to health care for yourself and your family?&quot; Because the format 
  of the interviews varied depending on the salience of particular issues to each 
  respondent, we will include information on context when quoting respondents. 
  </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;About one-third of our 
  respondents failed to report any concern about access to health care or insurance 
  issues during individual interviews. Many of these respondents were healthy 
  individuals who were not deeply involved in the care of the affected family 
  member. A few who were parents said they felt fortunate to have excellent coverage. 
  A parent who is also a physician employed at a large medical center explained 
  to us that he knew he had the finest care for his child available in the world. 
  In general, however, the more direct experience people have dealing with genetic 
  or other disability the greater their concern, mistrust and often anger at the 
  current health care financing system and its consequences. </font></P>

<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most emotionally charged 
  expressions of the need for health care reform come from adults with genetic 
  disease and the parents of children with cystic fibrosis or sickle cell disease. 
  They usually feel that their survival depends on the quality of medical care 
  available to them, yet obtaining the care they need is often a precarious process 
  to them, primarily for economic reasons. For example, a 29-year-old PWCF (person 
  with cystic fibrosis) with a doctorate who is pursuing an academic career told 
  us she worries more about insurance than about getting sick or getting better. 
  Her biggest concern about health care is paying for her treatment. She told 
  us she wanted to have free health care. &quot;I want that even more than I want 
  not to have CF.&quot; Another young adult with CF echoed this sentiment when 
  she told us:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If someone were to ask 
      me which is scarier to you, dealing with CF and the thought of dying or 
      medical coverage, without a heartbeat of a thought, medical coverage scares 
      me to death! . . . [H]aving the CF I can cope with as long as somehow some 
      way I’m going to be able to get the medical coverage and care that I need. 
      . . . What’s going on with our medical coverage scares the death out of 
      me. I have nightmares. In fact, when we got that letter about all the changes 
      that were going on at [Smith Medical </FONT>Center]<FONT FACE="Arial">, 
      I didn’t sleep, and it all hit all at once. I had stuff going on with my 
      medical coverage, I had stuff then at [Smith], so you’re rocking my world. 
      You’re taking away my place to get health and the way to pay for that health! 
      That scared me way more that the fact that I was coughing up blood at the 
      time! Way more. So those are the things that rock my world. (285)</font></P>

<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;One woman who was particularly 
  vocal on this point was not diagnosed until she was in her twenties. When asked, 
  &quot;In general, what do you think it means for a child to be born with cystic 
  fibrosis these days,&quot; she replied:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, I think you have 
      to classify the question according to the country. Because I have an international 
      perspective, I realize that, for instance, people born with CF in most European 
      countries are assured health care, regardless of the fact that they have 
      a pre-existing condition. And I think that has to be stated right up front. 
      In the majority of countries employment is assured despite having a disability 
      or a preexisting condition. I think in the United States we are more akin 
      to, if you will, third world countries, in our outlook as far as health 
      care and employment availability for people with CF. I think as far as health 
      care per se goes, you know, as far as treatment in hospitals and whatever, 
      we are on a par with the rest of the world.</font></P>

<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For a number of years this 
  woman received her health care coverage through her husband’s employment. After 
  several years of marriage she &quot;had a really bad year.&quot; She went on 
  to explain:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The following year, 
      he was laid off, and when he asked why he was laid off--a small company

      . . . Your premiums are too high, and there was absolutely nothing we could 
      do legally about that. . . Whenever I talk about the health care system

<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;As the life expectancy 
  of persons with cystic fibrosis lengthen (it is now 30 in the USA, and significantly 
  higher in some European countries, especially Denmark) new problems arise related 
  to health insurance coverage. Most parents’ health insurance coverage for their 
  children runs out when the children reach their early twenties. Adults with 
  CF are often unable to be employed full time because of their physical limitations 
  and time required for therapy. If they are healthy enough to work full time, 
  many companies will not hire them because they fear lost time from work higher 
  insurance premiums. As a result many adults with genetic disorders and their 
  families feel trapped by a system in which medical and treatment advances that 
  have enabled them to live longer are being undermined by a bureaucratic and 
  hostile health care financing system that subverts their potential to be productive 
  citizens. There is an elaborate discourse within the social world of cystic 
  fibrosis about strategies for dealing with these concerns. This discourse is 
  often infused with strong emotions, particularly fear and anger.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;Early during a focus 
  group made up of five young men with CF we asked participants about their expectations 
  for the future. An 18-year-old with CF explained how he was planning his future 
  around an occupation that would give him the best health insurance. In his view, 
  this meant not being self-employed, but instead working for a large company. 
  The focus group leader asked the next young man, &quot;Is that an issue for 
  you?&quot; He replied,</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yeah, I think its the 
      biggest issue for all of us. Lets see, I’m in the third year of a COBRA 
      insurance policy that only lasts three years, and then the only insurance 
      I have besides graduate student health insurance plan which is basically 
      worthless, is the State of California, GHPP (Genetically Handicapped Person’s 
      Program), which luckily will probably do everything I need done. But that 
      also means I’ll probably have to either get an employer when I graduate 
      that will somehow get around the pre-existing condition clause, or stay 
      in California and then do something else.</font></P>

<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;Another chimed in, &quot;We’re

    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not in that vein. The 
      things that concern me about insurance are a lot more of what they do cover 
      once they cover you. I happen to belong to an HMO that every time I tell 
      a doctor I belong to this particular HMO they just roll their eyes and say, 
      &quot;Oh, they’re the worst. A typical example is -- this has happened three 
      times in the last year, where I’ll put off going to the doctor till like 
      Friday when I gotta see somebody. I see him. Her prescribes an antibiotic 
      for me. I go to pick it up Friday afternoon. Its late, and my insurance 
      company has to okay this particular antibiotic in order for them to be paid. 
      So the pharmacist has to get a hold of this insurance company to get an 
      okay. They put him on hold, and if they don’t get it okayed I’m going through 
      the whole weekend without it. My company had three different plans, I picked 
      the cheapest one because the other two were very expensive. You could pick 
      your doctor, but the cost was prohibitive.</font></P>

  moved to the value of preventive treatment as opposed to acute treatment. One 
  participant lamented the fact that sometimes choices have to be made out of 
  fear of long-term costs reaching the policy cap. Drug co-payments were another 
  problem. One young man mentioned that prescription costs under his policy were 
  recently increased to eleven dollars each. He added that he requires five or 
  six prescriptions per month. The discussion then moved to the problem of paperwork 
  for reimbursements. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;Cystic fibrosis patients 
  and their families are very aware of the differences between health care policy 
  in this country and Canada and other Western European countries. They are aware 
  that differences in aggressiveness of treatment have significant consequences 
  for their health and longevity. Denmark is occasionally offered as an example, 
  since a Danish physician speaking at a CF Conference attended by some of our 
  participants presented data showing the life expectancy of CF patients in Denmark 
  is forty and rising. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;Adults with CF who can 
  avoid being officially diagnosed or labeled often do so to avoid discrimination. 
  We interviewed a relative of two adults with CF who are hiding their diagnoses. 
  One is in the military, and the other is a professional who seeks treatment 
  out of state because he fears his career will be jeopardized if his condition 
  is known. Neither of these adults would agree to be interviewed due to fears 
  of disclosure of their conditions. In both cases employability and, more indirectly, 
  health care coverage are concerns.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;The perspective of parents 
  on the topic of health care coverage is quite similar to that of CF patients 
  themselves. One significant difference is that while adults with CF are locked 
  out of jobs, their parents are often locked in. In virtually every family with 
  a child with CF, insurance and access to good CF treatment have a profound impact 
  on the parents’ professional and geographic mobility. In some cases women who 
  would prefer to be full-time caretakers of their CF children must keep their 
  jobs to keep the insurance. Fathers are often unable to move ahead professionally 
  because they cannot risk even temporarily losing coverage.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;When children grow up 
  and are uninsurable themselves, their parents may under some policies have their 
  child declared disabled and dependent. We have seen several parents who would 
  like to retire, but cannot because to do so threatens to deprive their child 
  of good health care coverage.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Extended family members 
  often recognize the insurance issues as potentially problematic when they consider 
  genetic testing. While the insurance situation appears to be a factor in discouraging 
  carrier testing, our data indicate that it encourages selective abortion. For 
  example, a cousin of a person with CF explained:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I would probably want 
      to know whether or not I carried it...&quot;If I was carrier, I would think 
      very carefully about whether or not we had enough money, because even with 
      help, even with financial aid, my aunt and uncle, it’s been a lot of money 
      for them.</font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not every family experiences 
  difficulty related to access to health care, but often those who are themselves 
  fortunate in this regard express concern for others who do not share their situation. 
  For example, one father told us he had no problems himself, but knows it is 
  a big problem for other people to get coverage. Furthermore, he isn’t worried 
  about his child’s future because he expects a cure for CF within 10 years. This 
  hope for a cure, which some families expect much sooner than this father, is 
  one factor that counterbalances concerns about health care coverage. The belief 
  that we are on the verge of curing the disease was most widespread in the year 
  or two following the identification of the gene for CF. Much of that optimism 
  that was always limited to cystic fibrosis families, and extremely rare among 
  sickle families, has since turned to disappointment and even cynicism about 
  medical predictions. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;Chronic illnesses such 
  as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell tend to keep adults from achieving economic 
  independence. In the case of sickle cell, the economic consequences seem to 
  be devastating for the families of origin as well. Fewer of them have the resources 
  to achieve or maintain a middle-class life style while coping with the disease 
  in a child. Mothers of children with sickle cell are more often single, and 
  if married, their spouse’s income is more likely to be small. Therefore, loss 
  of maternal employment is a more devastating economically. It does create eligibility 
  for Medicaid, however, as one mother explained, </font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">She’s on SSI . . . She 
      has full coverage and benefits. The only thing I worry about is if I get 
      a job and I get all of that assistance, then, they probably won’t cover 
      my baby because it’s a preexisting thing. So that’s the only thing. Right 
      now, I’m not complaining because the state is helping me and they take care 
      of her and she gets all the medical care she needs. . . . But one thing 
      I don’t care for is that I think she’d get better care if I had more money 
      or better coverage. I think she would get better care and more individual 
      care. Although I love Community Hospital and I love the clinic. . . I would 
      like to have my own private doctor, a hematologist doctor, plus be affiliated 
      with Children’s Hospital. But I would like to get her own doctor so that

<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;The overwhelming majority 
  of adults with SC are on Medicaid and disability and receive medical care free 
  of charge. In the large urban hospitals from which most of our respondents were 
  recruited, sickle cell patients who are seen at a sickle cell clinic may actually 
  get better care than other family members without sickle cell, because they 
  become known to the staff that specializes in their disease. In such cases, 
  their access concerns have less to do with payment than with mistrust of medicine 
  in general. While they tend to find individual providers they trust, there is 
  a pervasive mistrust of the system as a whole. In a focus group with five lower 
  class men with sickle-cell disease, there was discussion of the possibility 
  that a cure exists for sickle cell disease that is being withheld, as well as 
  concern about being used as &quot;guinea pigs.&quot; </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;I don’t trust the government 
  to want to do anything for black people. Even &#9;like you [another man with 
  SC in the group] said earlier, they may have a &#9;cure for it now, who knows. 
  But it doesn’t mean that they’re gonna give it &#9;to us.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;A third man agreed, 
  saying, &quot;I know . . . how secret and covert the government can be. I believe 
  they’ve got a cure for it.&quot; All of these men had found providers they trusted, 
  but both black and white providers established this trust on a personal level. 
  These personal relationships made it possible for sickle cell patients them 
  to function within the health care system, but did not change their view of 
  the medical system or &quot;the government.&quot; </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;In general, as we move 
  up the socio-economic ladder within the African-American community we see more 
  hope and less fear, but it is our view that very few African Americans believe 
  race is irrelevant in determining the resources devoted to sickle cell research 
  and treatment. With few exceptions, we received clearer statements of such critical 
  positions when research team members who were themselves African American conducted 
  individual interviews and focus groups.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;It is difficult to determine 
  the precise extent to which fears about loss of access to health care coverage 
  are a barrier to genetic testing. Nevertheless, we have been able to identify 
  several dimensions of the issue. Fear of being identified with a genetic disease, 
  largely because of the chronicity it implies, creates a general atmosphere that 
  is inhospitable to genetic testing for carriers. We find that it prevents diagnosis 
  of disease in cases that are not severe, as well as inhibiting carrier testing. 
  These are issues that deserve more attention by researchers.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Social and Cultural Differences 
  Between SC and CF Families</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;Three issues emerged 
  from our interviews as central to understanding the African-American response 
  to sickle cell testing. To a great extent they also distinguish these families 
  from the mostly white families confronting cystic fibrosis. The themes are: 
  (1) Risk as Stigmatizing; (2) Zones of Relevance, and (3) Mistrust of the Neutrality 
  of Medicine.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">[footnote: While 
  each of these themes can also be found among some of the white families at risk 
  for CF, in this context, they are neither as widely shared nor as strongly felt.]</font></P>
<P> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;<b>Risk as Stigma - 
  The Redefined Social Bond. </b>When medical professionals encourage or offer 
  genetic testing or other services they usually do so using the language of risk. 
  As with all terms, the meaning of the term &quot;risk,&quot; is a function of 
  context and the context. Biomedical professionals have a sharply different understanding 
  and use of the term than do the laity. This is particularly true among African 
  Americans at the lower end of the socioeconomic ladder. Unlike a sense of danger 
  that often arises directly from human experience, risk, as used in insurance 
  and medicine, is an idea deduced on the basis of probabilistic and sometimes 
  abstract calculations (Castel, 1991). It is most salient for those who have 
  managed to minimize or eliminate the sense of constant danger and unpredictability 
  from their lives. Historically, the concept of risk gained cultural currency 
  among the middle class because &quot;lowering risk&quot; was used to create 
  a sense of security, solidarity and community, linked as it was to the emergence 
  of insurance and compensation for loss. Today, however, from the point of view 
  of many African Americans the language of risk is associated with blame, stigma 
  and exclusion. The term is much less threatening to white middle- and upper-middle 
  class families who are more accustomed to confronting &quot;risk&quot; and then 
  coming to believe that they have successfully reduced the risk in their lives.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;We can see the differences 
  in perception in the accounts of our respondents who describe not statistical 
  risks, but instead speak of <I>individuals as being &quot;risks&quot;.</I> For 
  example, &quot;They told me I was a risk . . . &quot; This usage, equating individuals 
  rather than probabilities as risks reflects recognition that the social bond 
  has been redefined. Exclusion based on genetic vulnerabilities becomes a new 
  social practice. Instead of defining the social group and creating mutual support, 
  risk is now used to create and isolate the &quot;at-risk individual&quot;. Kenen 
  (1995) has placed the emergence of the concept of the at-risk health status 
  in historical context, pointing out that once acute illnesses were under control, 
  the medical community expressed more interest in chronic illnesses and extended 
  its control over formerly non-medicalized conditions such as pregnancy and childbirth. 
  She suggests that the new at-risk status appeals particularly to the upper-middle 
  class (p. 7) and the corporations and medical institutions that cater to them, 
  as preferred clientele.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;The use of the concept 
  of risk to label and confer blame on the less privileged segments of society 
  is a result of activities of specific interest groups who benefit by this interpretation. 
  In contrast, when we look at how members of families with genetic disorders 
  such as sickle cell (and sometimes even cystic fibrosis), use the term risk, 
  we find that typically it is not a quantitative or mathematical term but simply 
  another word for danger. &#9;When risk is used to refer to an undesirable possibility, 
  the &quot;risk&quot; of genetic disease is no more likely to be a central concern 
  than are many other potential problems such as loss of employment, loss of health 
  insurance, or loss of a relationship. In our attempts to elicit narratives, 
  the word often did not come up at all. Sometimes risk entered the dialogue when 
  the interviewer used the word as part of a probe or follow-up question. When 
  the interviewee introduced the concept, he or she was often quoting a provider, 
  such as &quot;I was told that if we both were carriers there would be a 25 percent 
  risk that our baby would have sickle cell disease.&quot; However, even well-educated 
  interviewees often indicated their own precise risk figures were not especially 
  relevant to them. As Abby Lippman’s (1979) work indicates, the major issue was 
  simply the possibility that a child would either have an abnormality or it will 
  not. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;At the lowest end of 
  the social hierarchy another meaning of the term risk is notable; risk as a 
  &quot;stigmatized identity.&quot; For example, one woman told us, &quot;The 
  insurance companies don’t want to cover you because you are a risk.&quot; or 
  as another woman explained, &quot;I can’t even get burial insurance . . . no 
  kind of insurance . . . because you are too much of a high risk.&quot; In this 
  quote as in a number of others that refer to people as risks, interviewees use 
  the term in the third person even if they have to switch mid-sentence. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;A woman in her 30s with 
  sickle cell disease told us that her fiancee’s family describes her as &quot;a 
  risk.&quot; She talks about the difficulty she had telling people she had sickle 
  cell disease and how this resulted in them thinking she is a risk. In her experience 
  people call her that when they want to prevent her from becoming a wife or mother. 
  Her response to this situation has been to have four children, two of whom have 
  sickle cell disease. She takes pride in her ability to prevent and respond to 
  her children’s crises without having to resort to hospitalization. In this context 
  her experience is valuable and she is no longer stigmatized. She found a way 
  to triumph over the perception of herself as a risk, which is to have children 
  with sickle cell who can appreciate her expertise in dealing with situation.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;Overwhelmingly our respondents 
  reject prenatal diagnosis and selective abortion as a strategy for determining 
  which pregnancies will be brought to term. They accept abortion but reject selective 
  abortion.&#9;</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;This definition of risk 
  may be related to the fact that as Lisa Handwerker (1994) has shown, since 1987 
  the courts have increasingly used medical testimony to prosecute women labeled 
  &quot;high risk&quot; for failure to comply with medical advice when their fetuses 
  or babies die. She suggests that attempts to prosecute women discourage rather 
  than encourage seeking medial care. In spite of the fact that the assessment 
  and management of risk for many conditions is neither standardized nor consistently 
  applied, health care providers and the legal system, unfortunately, make decisions 
  as if risk were objective &quot;fact.&quot; By contrast, patients understand 
  risk as part of their complex and ambiguous social world. They are well aware 
  that the label itself may confer misfortune, and the benefit it could confer 
  is much more obscure and remote.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;<b>Zones of Relevance. 
  </b>Closely related to the concept of risk is the issue of relevance. The more 
  predictable the environment, the more attractive it seems to be to engage in 
  the formal risk analysis that genetic medicine often requires. Phenomenologist 
  Alfred Schutz noted the fact that different things carry a different weight 
  for people at various times; he called this notion "zones of relevance." The 
  most attention is given to what he calls the &quot;primary zone.&quot; In certain 
  situations, it is in these areas that we most often solicit expertise (Schutz, 
  19??:124). Asking for the help of experts requires confidence that the specific 
  danger being focused on has been selected for one’s personal as well as the 
  collective benefit. This confidence decreases, however, as one descends the 
  socio-economic scale.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;In talking with one 
  father in our study, we see that he rarely has the occasion to put sickle cell 
  first. Besides his own children, he has taken on two of his brother’s sons, 
  ages 10 and 13, whom he describes as &quot;needing some structure.&quot; He 
  has been unemployed for the last year and is constantly trying to create work 
  for himself while his own sons are both entering &quot;manhood&quot; and facing 
  confusion about their own futures. His oldest son’s severe case of sickle cell 
  disease is only one of many problems, but the one for which most assistance 
  is available. He explains:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There’s an old proverb 
      that [says] when your house is on fire you don’t </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">think 
      about broken windows. In a lot of communities where sickle cell is [present], 
      they’re struggling. People are very poor and they have a lot of problems 
      so they don’t look at this particular problem as being one that’s overwhelming 
      in relation to other problems that they have. </font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus for families such as 
  this, genetic information has little relevance until it comes to the fore during 
  a specific episode of sickle cell crisis.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;When an uneducated young 
  woman fails to remember her precise risk figures, or doesn’t appear to be taking 
  them as seriously as some might think she should, she may be engaging in a much 
  more complex calculus of multiple risks. One of those risks is the possibility 
  of not finding love or bearing children at all. As one woman told us, &quot;lots 
  of kids have problems . . . I wouldn’t let that [the risk of sickle cell] be 
  an issue.&quot; </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;The selectiveness of 
  medical constructions of risk does not escape those who view life as an endless 
  series of challenges. Furthermore, it threatens one area of life which, even 
  if only temporarily, offers relief from a sense of failure, romantic love. The 
  importance of such relationships as a primary zone of relevance and thus a source 
  of resistance to carrier testing must not be overlooked. Respondents frequently 
  indicated that they perceived the calculatedness of risk analysis to be incompatible 
  with emotional commitment, as illustrated in an earlier cited quote linking 
  genetic testing with dog breeding. We found very few African-American women 
  willing to adopt a scientific or instrumental rational approach to their own 
  pregnancies. This is partly because pregnancy represents a commitment to a relationship 
  that is recognized to have multiple perils and more immediate perils.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Mistrust of the Neutrality 
  of Medicine.</b> The markedly precarious economic situations of most African-Americans 
  is what makes both &quot;risk as stigma,&quot; and &quot;zones of relevance&quot; 
  salient in their responses to genetic testing. Another factor that is perhaps 
  more deeply rooted and that is less clearly class-related is mistrust of medicine. 
  African-American respondents gave many indications that they mistrust the neutrality 
  of medicine as an institution and thus are often less likely than our non-African-American 
  respondents to view it as a source of support. Their narratives are peppered 
  with references to medicine as more a tool of domination and control than one 
  of health care providing. This is particularly striking in comparison with the 
  narratives of the predominantly white cystic fibrosis families. An African-American 
  family is much more likely to have had their child’s symptoms considered to 
  be the effects of child abuse or to have relatives and friends who have experienced 
  what they consider to be medical abuse. The widespread discourse of mistrust 
  is often affirmed through repeated encounters of direct personal experience.

      you that they have one and they don’t have one.&quot; And so she was worried

<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This mistrust has its roots

  of black women, the use of genetic testing as a surrogate for racial discrimination, 
  and the experimental research rationale used to withhold treatment of Black 
  men suffering from syphilis in the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. The latter is an 
  atrocity for which the U.S. government has recently formally apologized (Los 
  Angeles Times, 1967). More recently this mistrust has been fueled by attempts 
  to identify poor blacks with a biochemical inclination for violence and by the 
  contested claims of the link between race and the measurement of &quot;intelligence&quot; 
  by the authors of <I>The Bell Curve </I>(Hernstein and Murray, 1994). This is 
  the context in which responses to the concept of genetic risk can be better 
  understood. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;While both men and women 
  give evidence of mistrust of the institution of medicine, African-American women 
  are more likely to focus on individual providers and are thus more willing to 
  attempt to actively negotiate the world of biomedicine. They are also more frequently 
  able to forge personal relationships of trust in clinical settings. &#9;</font></P>

<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;The final difference 
  we will discuss between sickle cell and cystic fibrosis respondents is the difference 
  in their perceptions of the social implications of genetic testing. African 
  Americans, in particular, are concerned about potential abuses of testing in 
  the social and political realms as well as in medical practice. This theme is 
  much more pervasive in interviews of both African-American men and women than 
  among whites. A good example of the general mood on this topic was expressed 
  by a mother of a child with sickle cell:</font></P>

      will be discriminated against. I know that! We can say anything we want, 
      but the facts are, have been and will be that there will be discrimination. 
      There will be unfair treatment of a lot of people as this becomes the rule 
      of thumb, or the order of the day when it shouldn't be like that. I can 
      see people even being divided up into groups. You know, you got all this, 
      you can't do this—you know, dictating to people what they can and cannot 
      do. And I think that is just wrong. I don't like it. I'm not comfortable

<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While the level of concern 
  and mistrust is definitely lower among whites, a distinct lack of enthusiasm 
  for genetic testing is apparent in most interviews. The dimensions of molecular 
  genetics that both CF and SC family members find compatible with their own social 
  worlds, their priorities, commitments and perceptions of reality, are treatment 
  and cure. They appreciate advances in treatment and hope for a cure with varying 
  degrees of optimism. When we asked members of CF families if they followed developments 
  or advances in genetics we consistently got hopeful responses about new treatments, 
  particularly the possibility of gene therapy. Sickle cell family members are 
  less optimistic, which is not surprising given that carrier testing has been 
  available for decades but few new treatments have emerged. Rarely do interviewees

<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While each disease group 
  has distinctive patterns of dealing with the disorders, we have been struck 
  by similarities in resistance between families in which cystic fibrosis has 
  been diagnosed, which are overwhelmingly white and those in which sickle cell 
  disease has been diagnosed, which are overwhelmingly black. Both groups of families 
  make an important distinction between medical knowledge directed toward care, 
  and genetic testing for the purposes of &quot;prevention.&quot; Both welcome 
  the care-giving aspects of medical knowledge, and both display resistance and 
  avoidance to testing for prevention. Thus a common response to prenatal diagnosis 
  is to use it, not in relation to any decision about continuing or terminating 
  the pregnancy, but for reassurance or to provide an early warning system should 
  the fetus be affected. One woman explained that it is better to get the grieving 
  over the loss of a healthy child over with before the baby is born. Using prenatal 
  diagnosis to prepare the family, both emotionally and practically, is a more 
  common strategy among CF families than sickle cell families, partly due to better 
  access to early prenatal care and to health care services in general.</font></P>

<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></FONT> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A focus on thalassemia was 
  not part of the original project design. It evolved primarily because one of 
  our clinical settings offered a rare opportunity for access to patients or families 
  affected by thalassemia, and because physicians at this hospital asked for our 
  assistance in understanding the perspectives of these patients, many of whom 
  are recent Asian immigrants to the U.S. We were eager to study these families, 
  because like sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis, thalassemia is a life 
  threatening recessive genetic disorder and this group could provide us with 
  yet another level of cultural and social variation on how high-risk families 
  relate to genetic disorders and genetic testing. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">[footnote: Thalassemia 
  major (the most serious form) negatively affects the production of red blood 
  cells (hemoglobin) such that the tissues have insufficient oxygen, thereby leading 
  to anemia. Monthly blood transfusions are standard treatment, and the need is 
  usually apparent before 18 months of age. At this age, the child often has signs 
  of anemia, stunted growth, or an enlarged spleen, also manifested in a swollen 
  stomach. Without treatment, the bone marrow (the tissue inside the bones that 
  forms red blood cells) expands as it tries to manufacture more of the necessary 
  red cells. This development weakens the bones and causes bulging in the cheekbones 
  and forehead areas. In addition to these visible changes -- facial distortions, 
  prominent bone structure, short stature -- there generally is also loss of appetite 
  and increased irritability. Bone marrow transplants are the only long-term cure 
  for this disorder, and are much more likely to be successful with children under 
  seven than older age groups. They are least risky with a fully compatible sibling 
  match, although new technologies are making unrelated donors a possibility for 
  the distant future. A person with beta-thalassemia major must, at puberty, begin 
  desferal treatment, which works to remove excess iron which accumulates in the 
  body as a result of regular blood transfusions. Because of advances in treatment, 
  the issue of life expectancy is largely indeterminate, although life expectancy 
  is clearly increasing. ]</font></P>
<font face="Arial"> </font> 
<P><font face="Arial"><b>Methods.</b> The respondents from families affected by 
  thalassemia, unlike the CF and SC respondents, were all recruited in a hospital 
  setting. We had hoped to move beyond this initial point of contact into the 
  extended families but this was rarely possible given time and resource constraints. 
  Thalassemia interviews faced the same difficulties we encountered with SC and 
  CF families, such as time pressures on parents and the need to care for children. 
  However, we had to overcome additional obstacles as well. These included language 
  barriers, a cultural reluctance to discuss personal matters with outsiders who 
  were not medical professionals, and feelings of vulnerability due often to tenuous 
  residency (immigration) status. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">We examined a total of 25 cases (parents and affected adult 
  children) representing a variety of middle-eastern and Asian cultures. The sample 
  of Asians affected by thalassemia was the largest subgroup, and the group in 
  which we began to identify culturally patterned responses. Yet, the Asian sample 
  is diverse with respect to ethnic background (e.g. Chinese, Vietnamese, Laotian, 
  Cambodian) and religious orientation (Catholic, Buddhist, no religion). </font></P>
<font face="Arial"> </font> 
<P><font face="Arial"><b>Overview<I>.</I></b> Because only members of nuclear 
  families were interviewed, the range of familial responses has hardly been tapped. 
  Nevertheless, we have identified some interesting issues, and we will briefly 
  summarize those most relevant to genetic testing.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Responses of family members can be broadly categorized into 
  two types: (1) avoidance, expressed as reserve, distance, and minimal communication, 
  and (2) vigilance, expressed as interest, energy, and engagement. These patterns 
  of vigilance and avoidance need not be mutually exclusive, and it is apparent 
  that some of these experiences may reflect "stages", either linear or cyclical. 
  Vigilance occurs when people attempt to reduce uncertainty by seeking knowledge 
  and acting on that knowledge. Avoidance is a strategy to attempt to cope with 
  uncertainty by blocking, ignoring, or circumscribing unpleasant knowledge (Weitz, 
  1994: 138-139). Several factors associated with thalassemia seem to foster "avoidance" 
  patterns, while other factors encourage vigilance among these families. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial" size="-1">[footnote: Any one interviewee, however, might 
  manifest both patterns, being distant and avoiding in one context (e.g. hospital) 
  or stage of illness (e.g. early diagnosis) while vigilant in another (e.g. seeking 
  out information about alternative cures).]</font></P>
<font face="Arial"><FONT FACE="Arial"> </font> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Patterns of Avoidance.</b> 
  Parents must first come to terms with the diagnosis. A typical initial reaction 
  to the diagnosis is shock and resistance. Thus, one research assistant recorded 
  in her notes the strategy one of the medical doctors at tje hospital routinely 
  tried to break through parental resistance to starting blood transfusions: </font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2></font> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What he does is let 
      the kids get pretty sick so the parents can see with their own eyes that 
      the kids need help. Then he starts the transfusions and lets the kids deteriorate 
      again. This proves to the parents that the kids benefit from the transfusions 
      -- need them to be healthy. Dr. Jones feels this will help families coming 
      in to be transfused. Dr. Jones said that he knows from a kid's blood levels 
      far in advance when the kid is going to need transfusions. But he can't 
      just start giving the kids blood right away before the child gets sick because 
      then the family wouldn't believe the kid needed transfusions. "I have to 
      do it that way because families have to buy into the treatment." Dr. Jones 
      seemed to feel that families had to see their kid was very ill before they 
      would commit to anything so arduous as monthly transfusions.</font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the early stages of diagnosis 
  the parents search for meaning. The question, "Why my child(ren)?" dominates, 
  as individuals try to absorb this personal sense of crisis. Genetic knowledge 
  alone is of limited value in promoting "acceptance" of the disorder at this 
  level, even if parents accept the fact that the disease had to do technically 
  with "something in the blood." </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A major cultural belief 
  competing with the dominant or official medical understandings of disease is 
  a belief in karma. A Chinese father of a thalassemic child (351) was described 
  by the interviewer as still having to cope with his own contributing role in 
  the disease, a culpability associated with another lifetime : "He used to blame 
  himself for the fact that (the child) has Thal major. He sometimes thinks that 
  he did something bad in another life and that now he is paying for it by having 
  a child with problems." Similarly, a Chinese mother (364) at first didn't tell 
  anyone in either her family or her work about (the child's) thalassemia. This 
  seemed to be a combination of not wanting to make her relatives sad and worried 
  about (the child) and also realizing that they might extrapolate from this that 
  there was something bad in their family that they had done to deserve this. 
  One pattern discerned was a cultural belief that imperfect children are punishment 
  for bad associations in the past--even going back several generations through 
  the ancestors. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is also a comtemporary 
  version of culpability. As with sickle-cell anemia and cystic fibrosis families, 
  the medicalization of illness does not always effectively neutralize feelings 
  of blame. Mothers especially may experience guilt and feel that the disease 
  is a result of something they did wrong during pregnancy (316, 331, 359, 408). 
  About his wife's long-standing inability to accept the diagnosis of their thalassemic 
  child, a Chinese male (359) reported: </font></P>

      when she sit and alone, and I can, I caught her crying. And then we talked 
      about it... she's now little bit more fatalistic in some ways. I think it's, 
      it's difficult for her to accept... does understanding of a phenomenon helps 
      one to accept its, its, condition? I don't know. I'm not trained in that 
      field, so I really don't know. Ah, I think she has enough understanding 
      of the thalassemia as a disease or disorder, but does that mean any easier 
      for her to accept the disorder when it happen to your own child? I don't 
      know.</font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some of the self-blame in 
  the above instance is attributed to guilt for not recognizing that a series 
  of miscarriages prior to the birth of the child could be signs or warnings that 
  something was amiss.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another mother of a thalassemic 
  child (333), an immigrant from Thailand, worried that when her eight-year old 
  son gets older, he will ask questions about his disease and blame his parents. 
  She is not otherwise ashamed to talk about the disease and, in fact, is glad 
  to inform others about it. Furthermore, precisely because thalassemia and genetic 
  ideas are not part of general public knowledge, other family members may also 
  resist testing for themselves. The avoidance of diagnosis or testing has implications 
  for screening. Commenting on this, a researcher recorded in her field notes:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mrs. X’s in-laws, however, 
      did not believe this explanation. They thought that it was all Mrs. X's 
      fault that she and her husband had a sick child. Her mother-in-in law in 
      particular blamed her alone for the problem saying that her child was sick 
      because she was so skinny. Mrs. X also said that her husband's brothers 
      and sisters did not believe that it was a disease that ran in their family 
      until three years later when her husband's brother had a child with Thal. 
      At this point her husband's younger sister went to get tested before she 
      got married. (316)</font></P>

<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another case is of particular 
  interest because it shows how major shifts in cultural attitudes can nevertheless 
  occur with both medicalization and shifts in social contexts. This pattern, 
  which was surprisingly common among those we spoke to points to reorientation 
  from avoidance to vigilance. The shift is most clearly delineated, however, 
  in this example. The father of two thalassemic boys (331) reported that in Hong 
  Kong the stigma associated with a genetic trait would ruin one's chances of 
  marriage, constituting a major barrier to genetic testing, even though the Chinese 
  Family Planning Association was said to encourage all citizens to take such 
  preventative measures. Attitudes towards treatment, in turn, reflected a form 
  of cultural fatalism. Thus, regarding this father's own situation, the interviewer 
  wrote:</font></P>
<DIR> 
  <DIR> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"></font> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Initially Mr. Ho was 
      reluctant to have his son transfused because he held the belief of traditional 
      Chinese philosophy that things were the way they were meant to be. He felt 
      that treatment would only extend his sorrow. His son, however, began to 
      receive transfusions and after that Mr. Ho changed his mind about the treatment 
      doing more harm than good because it was obvious that the child felt much 
      better when he was being transfused.</font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The shift in attitude, noted 
  above, eventually extended to not only accepting the genetic definition but 
  to advocating testing for all kinds of problems, such as Down syndrome or other 
  developmental disabilities. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While fatalism can be rooted 
  in cultural beliefs, whether this attitude is reinforced or overcome depends 
  similarly on the social context of the experience of illness. Thus, the mother 
  of a 15-year old boy who was diagnosed in Hong Kong as thalassemic (316) reported 
  that her son was now much more optimistic about his condition since arriving 
  in the United States, primarily because he saw for the first time that there 
  were thalassemics older than 30. He concluded that he would not necessarily 
  die young, but conceivably grow up and even marry. By contrast, a 15-year-old 
  Cambodian patient was described as pessimistic about her future, largely because 
  she saw her older thalassemic sister not doing well. Her missed hospital appointments 
  and noncompliance with treatment schedules might be seen not only as "self-fulfilling 
  prophesies" but as an avoidance reaction to her own image of the prospects which 
  awaited the "inevitable" unfolding of her own condition. (404) </font></P>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></FONT></font> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In some cases, vigilance 
  was undermined by or diverted by social problems not directly related to the 
  disease itself. Thus, a Cambodian mother was distressed over her son's gang 
  affiliations, delinquency, school problems, and running away from home. As the 
  researcher or field worker noted, she was "not sure whether his problems are 
  because of his Thal or because of his being a teenager." (405) </font></P>
<font face="Arial"> </font> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Patterns of vigilance.</b><I> 
  </I>While Asian health beliefs contain certain elements of "fatalism" in their 
  orientation, it is also true that there is a great deal of activity based on 
  notions of effort or "willpower" towards overcoming problems. These attitudes 
  seem relevant to explaining the greater propensity towards vigilance as they 
  encompass specific medical, historical, and social/cultural factors which not 
  only converge to produce this more vigilant frame of mind, but which also differentiate 
  the thalassemia population from the other two risk populations. </font></P>
<font face="Arial"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> </font> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As recent immigrants, this 
  risk population encounters the American health care system for the "first time," 
  and therefore, their experiences are, by definition, less predefined. Whatever 
  cultural beliefs may have competed with the initial medical diagnosis, thalassemia 
  families on average are less mistrustful than sickle-cell families towards what 
  Western science has to offer. The possibility of receiving a bone marrow transplant 
  is perhaps the best indicator of this receptivity. The &quot;non-compliance&quot; 
  and missed appointments reported by physicians, on the other hand, seem to stem 
  largely from relations to an impersonal hospital bureaucracy, the strict requirements 
  of the treatment regimen that is to be sustained for life (i.e. the administering 
  of desferal injections five times a week), and the fact that patients generally 
  do not feel sick enough at the time they are expected to return for treatment 
  (402, 403, 405). </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Alternative Medicine.</b> 
  Another reason that might explain the propensity for many thalassemia families 
  to be "vigilant" is the relative availability of a wider range of health solutions 
  or treatment options. While sickle-cell and cystic fibrosis families also explored 
  nonconventional avenues, it is even clearer in the thalassemia cases that families 
  draw upon their traditional cultures. As with the sickle-cell and cystic fibrosis 
  families, a college education heightens the tendency to assume greater responsibility 
  for health care. This tendency will take an "alternative" turn in the case of 
  thalassemia families, where there are strong cultural ties to a distinct medical 
  tradition. In general, class differences do not appear to be obstacles to pursuing 
  these alternative health care strategies, because these alternative approaches 
  are often less expensive. Since our recruiting of respondents occurred in a 
  hospital setting, it is not clear, however, how much they rely on such alternative 
  avenues of care to the exclusion of Western medicine, or use it conjointly with 
  hospital care. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Grandparents in one household 
  (364), for example, played an important role in seeking alternative medical 
  treatment, taking their then two-month grandson to China to confirm the genetic 
  diagnosis. The maternal grandmother visited a number of hospitals there, consulting 
  different doctors in order to better understand the problem. Altogether, the 
  child stayed in China for six months and received treatment for thalassemia 
  via a somewhat different method. This involved a combination of more frequent 
  transfusions, acupuncture, and iron pills. Despite the fact that the maternal 
  grandmother belonged to a household of fourteen, where the total family income 
  was under $30,000 annually, economic resources were reported not to have been 
  a significant barrier. As the mother explained, the cost of having her child 
  tested and treated in China amounted to only $300 in Chinese money or $50 in 
  US dollars. Eventually, it was the low blood supply and the lack of individual 
  medical attention (1 nurse for every 20 children) that influenced the family's 
  decision to bring the child back to the United States for treatment. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While economic resources 
  (including insurance coverage) enable the consideration of other medical options 
  (such as bone marrow transplants), educational level seems most critical in 
  shaping how individuals respond to or integrate medical information into their 
  lives. It may be that the high value placed on education in Asian-American families 
  with thalassemia contributes to this willingness, interest, and ability to independently 
  pursue medical knowledge.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One Chinese father (359), 
  for example, pointed out that he came from a family in which everyone was college-educated. 
  As an engineering manager who earned over $50,000 a year, he took an extremely 
  rational and intellectual approach, avidly reading a range of medical and technical 
  articles, in Chinese-language sources as well as English. While traditional 
  healing practices were investigated along with advances in Western medicine, 
  the former were eventually terminated because progress could not be objectively 
  measured. As he explained, the process was "to a large degree like rolling the 
  dice, but you are, you are in the blind. You don't know whether there's any 
  progress made, or if there's any slip back being made, because there's absolutely 
  no way of monitoring it." </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Bone marrow transplants<I>.</I></b> 
  As in sickle-cell and cystic fibrosis families, chronicity presents an inevitable 
  drain upon financial resources, concerns about insurance coverage, the effect 
  on a potential mate, and certain problems with long-term care. In the case of 
  thalassemia, blood transfusions at the hospital and desferal treatment at home 
  lead many to pursue the possibility of bone marrow transplants, which promise 
  far and away the greatest hope for long-term cure. Without this procedure, medical 
  complications can result with the development of antigens, which in turn would 
  lead to the rejection of blood transfusions. The same father who had explored 
  traditional healing methods only to rule them out as inadequate because progress 
  could not be objectively measured also felt that transfusions were not the long-term 
  solution.</font></P>

    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">...my wife and I still 
      hold the view that transfusion is not a long-term solution. Although it 
      alleviates the symptoms of thalassemia, blood transfusion is not a, solution, 
      not a true solution. The basic disorder still persists. As she grow older, 
      given the frequency of transfusion she will run into some point in time, 
      . . . having too many antigens in her body. That she will start rejecting 
      transfusions, so to us that is not a long-term solution. I also understand 
      that at that point in time, the bone marrow transplant was the true solution.

<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While bone marrow transplants 
  are expensive procedures, his own cost-benefit analysis (comparing the cost

<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2></font> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While there is a waiting 
  list for possible bone marrow donors, the ideal donor is likely to be a sibling, 
  though in one highly unusual instance it was the mother (355, 356). Because 
  of the heavy burdens of raising a thalassemic child, some parents do not want 
  to have any further children, especially if there is this risk of the child 
  having thalassemia and abortion may or may not be a viable option (333, 351, 
  405). Others are undeterred by the concern of having additional children and 
  see this as a real strategy by which to find a possible match (364, 410). Thus, 
  a Chinese mother of three, who lives in a household of 14 other family members 
  (364), indicated she had gambled on having a second son in the hopes of a match. 
  While this son was a carrier, not a match, her third child, a daughter proved 
  to be match. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">[footnote: When 
  both parents are carriers, the mathematical probabilities of inheriting Beta-Thalassemia 
  major are one in four, which in genetic terms, refers to the chances of both 
  parents passing on to the child an abnormal (altered) genes for hemoglobin.] 
  </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In short, although genetic 
  science can aid in monitoring or ensuring optimal care post-natally, Asian families 
  with thalassemia individuals are predisposed towards taking a more proactive 
  stance. This is reflected in efforts to take advantage of prenatal testing, 
  as well as search for a bone marrow match. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Abortion.</b> Since thalassemia 
  is like other recessive diseases, its diagnosis is most frequently post-partum 
  and the first time that parents have ever heard of the disease. For this reason, 
  abortion was rarely an option in the families observed and interviewed. However, 
  when abortion was suggested as a hypothetical possibility, there was little 
  hesitation, reflecting a practical stance. While there were also exceptions 
  (333), including a woman who worked at an infertility clinic (368), family members 
  generally did not hesitate to say they would have chosen abortion had prenatal 
  information been available. Having a chronically affected child merely reinforced 
  these attitudes. This is in marked contrast to cystic-fibrosis and sickle-cell 
  families. In general, abortion was considered by Asian immigrant families to 
  be a viable option. Their views on this topic seem to be relatively unaffected 
  by religious notions, but perhaps more importantly we hypothesize, it may reflect 
  cultural differences in the definition of the fetus. There is little indication 
  in our interviews of the level of imputing personhood or equating human life 
  with the fetus, as we certainly found in families at risk for CF and sickel 
  cell anemia. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In one rare instance the 
  husband and wife apparently had the opportunity to abort because the disease 
  was diagnosed beforehand. They chose to not abort. The respondent who was the 
  father (355), indicated that family members were surprised that the pregnancy 
  was not terminated: "Several people have said why you keep -- have her? Why 
  you have her?" Ignorance about how serious and debilitating the disease may 
  have been one factor, since he did reflect retrospectively that abortion would 
  have made better sense given the incredible burden of living with the disease. 
  </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>AIDS<I>.</I></b> Although 
  shame and social isolation have been among the culturally traditional responses 
  to certain illnesses thought to be contagious, hereditary, or stigmatizing (e.g. 
  mental illness), the major social avoidance patterns connected with thalassemia 
  have to do little with the genetic disease <I>per se</I>, but rather are related 
  to risks that blood transfusions seems to pose in terms of contracting AIDs. 
  Given that treatment typically consists of monthly transfusions, other family 
  members were concerned about social contact and exposure to the AIDS virus. 
  The following case illustrates how social isolation was more emotionally wrenching 
  than the genetic disease itself, complicating relationships around the primary 
  medical condition.</font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recalling how his own immediate 
  family was placed in pariah status by relatives fearful of contact and contagion 
  and therefore "openly hostile," one father (359) described this period as "the 
  most difficult phase in my life." Although family members eventually "started 
  accepting her (the thalassemic child) back" when AIDS information became more 
  accurate and widespread, the social rejection was particularly hard on the wife 
  because it was a Chinese family, where ties that generally exist between sisters 
  (now distanced by the fear of AIDS) are usually closer than those between brothers. 
  The husband thus recalled this as a period where his wife "cried a lot," and 
  the two took "extremely long walks" to ease the pain of social isolation. </font></P>
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because genetic diseases, 
  unlike AIDS, are not perceived as "contagious," the medical diagnosis can relieve 
  a great deal of guilt or blame. The same respondent thus explained that apart 
  from that critical period clouded by the fear of AIDs, parents, friends of his 
  parents, and acquaintances are now quite accepting of the daughter and her condition. 
  The contagious versus non-contagious aspect of illness is central:</font></P>

  <DIR> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"></font> 
    <P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I don't think there's 
      reason for them to behave any more differently than they normally do, do 
      now. Will they reject us because of (the child)? Ah, I don't know. I mean, 
      we -- it's just like, you know, if one of my friends have -- their parents 
      -- are arthritic, do I reject them because of that? No. It's not contagious 
      disease. I don't care. I mean, if it's contagious disease, that may be different. 
      It's not contagious disease, so I don't know. I don't think so.</font></P>
  </DIR>
</DIR>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></FONT></font> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In general, to the extent 
  that patients did not "talk about" the disease to others, there were at least 
  two main reasons: (1) the fear of social rejection as a result of HIV status, 
  the threat of HIV, or the consequences which either HIV or genetic status might 
  have on employment (351, 359, 364, 392, 401, 402, 403), and (2). </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Once the definition of the problem as a genetic disorder 
  is accepted and understood, thalassemia often evokes a proactive attitude towards 
  genetic testing and communicating such information to family members, as well 
  as a more favorable attitude towards abortion than we observed in either the 
  sickle cell or cystic fibrosis respondents. Language barriers currently are 
  a major barrier to many being able to fully absorb genetic information or the 
  medical advice that is related. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Based on these preliminary findings, it is likely that public 
  education about thalassemia and genetic testing would be well received, particularly 
  given the preventative orientation of this population and its willingness to 
  incorporate genetic knowledge into their reproductive planning and behavior. 
  Genetic knowledge can function to promote more "rational" communication in thalassemic 
  cases, but the medical definition does not entirely eliminate family tension 
  or stigma. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">It has been noted elsewhere that unquestioned acceptance 
  of medical authority can make issues of informed consent problematic: "The medical 
  model is complementary to Asian expectations and respect for authority and may 
  lead to uninformed consent to genetic professional's recommendations" (Wang 
  and Marsh, 1992: 81). To the extent that thalassemia is understood to have stages 
  in the long-term unfolding and adjustment to its chronicity, the construction 
  of meaning around the disease is likely to be more "open-ended" and responsive 
  to new interpretations or understandings during those periods when some kind 
  of medical adjustment is necessary (e.g. the initiation of desferal treatment). 
  Further research, in other words, is needed to determine how cultural beliefs 
  intersect with this definition at various stages of illness and disclosure, 
  and the extent to which the adjustment process reflects a reconciliation of 
  non-medical issues with the official diagnosis. The overall positive response 
  to genetic screening can be likened, on the surface, however, to the positive 
  response of Americans of Ashkenazi Jewish descent to Tay-Sachs screening, a 
  useful point for any future comparative study. </font></P>
<font face="Arial"> </font> 
<P><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Summary and Implications</b></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">&#9;This study has examined the processes by which genetic 
  knowledge is integrated into the lived experience of high-risk family members. 
  We have observed a wide range of responses to new genetic knowledge – from the 
  kind of vigilance that proponents of genetic testing advocate to avoidance and 
  even opposition. We have found that these responses to not occur randomly, but 
  are patterned along social, cultural and economic dimensions. Among families 
  at risk for cystic fibrosis compared with those at risk for sickle cell disease 
  there are significant differences as well as interesting similarities. One major 
  pattern we have observed transcends ethnicity or genetic condition. It is this: 
  the closer people are to someone with genetic disease, the more problematic 
  and usually <I>unacceptable </I>genetic testing is as a strategy for dealing 
  with the issue. To understand the counterintuitive finding that enthusiasm for 
  genetic testing is lowest among those closest to these conditions, we must remember 
  that the successful functioning of high-risk families rests on their acknowledgement 
  of the value of the lives and contributions of their members with genetic disease. 
  </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">High-risk family members who support genetic research do 
  so primarily because they view it as leading to better care and ultimately a 
  cure, not because they support genetic testing.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Sustaining relationships in the face of the gene disorders 
  we have described requires belief in a social bond that can withstand the threat 
  of disability, as well as the recognition that the value of the life of a person 
  is not diminished by physical limitations. These values are woven into the narratives 
  that hold these families together. Without these values, relationships cannot 
  be sustained. Genetic testing as a strategy for eliminating the burdens of genetic 
  disease is experienced as a potential threat to these values. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">When we began our study (in 1992), shortly after the late 
  1989 identification of the genetic mutation that causes cystic fibrosis, there 
  was great joy and enthusiasm for genetic research among families with an affected 
  member. A few respondents even cited the expectation of an imminent cure as 
  justification for not being tested. Since that time we have watched this hope 
  fade, but without any increasing enthusiasm for genetic testing. It is difficult 
  for family members to integrate their personal and family narratives with those 
  of molecular genetics when the latter is used primarily for genetic diagnostics 
  rather than in a context of caring. As a result genetic testing tends to be 
  most acceptable, and most easily considered, among those whose concepts of genetic 
  disease are disembodied and abstract – those without a family history of the 
  disease.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"> A major policy question related to genetic testing, the 
  degree and extent to which consumers want expanded access to such procedures 
  has been discussed without much empirical data. The assumption implicit in recent 
  decisions of the Cystic Fibrosis Consensus forum (April, 1997) to offer testing 
  to those with a family history, is one rooted in the social worlds of molecular 
  and clinical genetics From this perspective, it makes most sense to offer the 
  test where it is most likely to come up positive. Yet, this can only be effective 
  if results influence reproductive plans. Our research indicates genetic testing 
  rarely changes reproductive plans. If policies were to be based on the expressed 
  needs of high-risk families a much greater emphasis would be placed on treatment 
  and care. Testing would be de-emphasized.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">If genetic testing is to continue to target those with family 
  histories of genetic disorders, programs must recognize that the intra and interpersonal 
  conflicts regarding genetic testing are much more complex and disturbing than 
  heretofore considered. It is in these families that conflict, issues of guilt, 
  shame and blame, and difficulties in integrating the new diagnostic technologies 
  are most likely to exist. The practice of offering carrier tests or prenatal 
  diagnosis to those with a family history of a genetic disease, is therefore, 
  much more problematic and complex in terms of potential counseling needed. We 
  therefore join a host of other commentators and ethicists in clearly stating 
  that the practice of offering carrier testing or prenatal diagnosis to the general 
  population is not a good idea (Holtzman, 1997, Task Force). We now have data 
  from the lives of those &quot;in the experience to support this position. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Racial-ethnic differences in rates of utilizing prenatal 
  diagnosis, as well as responses of all potential consumers of genetic testing 
  are best understood by exploring how the social and cultural contexts of those 
  actions are constructed. These, too, are illuminated in the narratives of our 
  respondents. Here we can see the frames of meaning lay persons draw upon in 
  making sense of their lives. Central among all ethnic groups are norms and values 
  that frequently run counter to the instrumental-rationality of the world of 
  molecular and clinical genetics. As we have seen, on a continuum, African Americans 
  are much more sensitive than whites to the potential misuse of science and medicine. 
  As a collectivity, their caution is firmly rooted both in a culturally invoked 
  history and in often stark current economic conditions. This caution is not 
  likely to wane until these conditions are changed. Indeed, until African Americans 
  can see medical institutions devoted to addressing a wide range of health care 
  needs, individual practitioners promoting genetic testing will continue to be 
  viewed with a far greater level of mistrust and suspicion than they can comprehend 
  – given their own ideology of neutral technical advances in biomedicine and 
  genetics.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Although more interest has been exhibited in understanding 
  why certain ethnic groups appear more resistant to new genetic technologies 
  than others, we believe the most important finding of our study is the similar 
  difficulties all groups experience in integrating two divergent discourses. 
  One of these, the discourse of molecular genetics, brackets the larger social 
  context. Meanwhile, the nature of the social worlds in which high-risk families 
  live is by definition context-dependent and negotiated using basically different 
  domain assumptions. Where genetic testing is embraced as a useful tool in realizing 
  one’s reproductive plans it is because family members have found a way to define 
  testing as consistent with the personal and family narratives that form the 
  organizing framework for their behavior. Often this means defining the well-being 
  of existing children with disease in terms of benefits accruing from testing 
  and even selective abortion. In any case, it is in a context of care that genetic 
  testing is most likely to be successfully integrated into family life.</font></P>
