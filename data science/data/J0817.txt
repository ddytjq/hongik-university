<h1>Rookie Zanardi follows the Formula to Portland triumph</h1>

PORTLAND, Ore. -- Rookie Alex Zanardi of Italy started on the pole and pulled away to victory Sunday in the IndyCar
Budweiser/G.I. Joe's 200 at Portland International Raceway.<p>
Zanardi survived a slippery
few laps during a rain shower early in the race and went on to a
nearly wire-to-wire victory to become the first rookie to win an IndyCar event this year and the latest driver to move from the Formula One ranks
to earn a title in an IndyCar event. 
<p><img SRC="0623zanardi.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="150">
&quot;It feels great,&quot; said Zanardi, a former bit player on the Formula One circuit.  &quot;I'm happy for the Target team,
Chip Ganassi and all of the guys.&quot; 
<p>
Zanardi was followed by a pair of Brazilians who also came out of the
Formula One ranks -- Gil de Ferran, last year's IndyCar Rookie
of the Year, and Christian Fittipaldi, runner-up in rookie points
last year.  
<p>
Al Unser Jr. made a major gain in the PPG Cup
points standings with a fourth-place finish, and Parker
Johnstone had his second Top 5 finish of the year. 
<p>
Zanardi and de Ferran both drove Honda-powered cars. Honda has
won six of the nine races this season.
<p>
Zanardi's Reynard Honda averaged 103.283 mph on the nine-turn,
1.95-mile Portland International Raceway road course. In his rookie
season at age 29, Zanardi's previous best finish this year was
fourth at the Rio 400, where he also had the pole.
<p>
Zanardi jumped right out to the lead as the field began to thin
early on. Michael Andretti was hampered by an engine problem on
the first lap and ended up with a 12th-place finish.  Raul
Boesel of Brazil, Canadians Paul Tracy and Greg Moore and Bryan
Herta left with mechanical problems or accidents. 
<p>
Rain began to fall about a third of the way into the race, and
Zanardi lost his lead to Unser temporarily as the Penske driver
switched to rain tires.  As conditions dried, it was the Honda
power of Zanardi that would overcome the challenge and lead the
final 58 laps of the 98-lap race. 
<p>
Although this was Zanardi's first win, it was the fifth win for
Chip Ganassi Racing -- partially owned by former NFL
quarterback Joe Montana. 
<p>
The rain cost PPG Cup points leader Jimmy Vasser dearly, though,
when his car slid off the course and stalled. He never managed to
get back in contention and wound up out of the points in 15th
place. Vasser still leads the PPG standings with 98 points. Unser
picked up 12 points to give him 87.
<p>
Michael Andretti, winner of the previous two races, had early
ignition problems and wound up 12th. That was good for one point
and 72 for the season. Fittipaldi also has 72 points.
<p>
Zanardi's victory margin would have been much greater had it not
been for a yellow flag that tightened the race.
<p>
The yellow came out when Michel Jourdain Jr. ran off the course
on the 63rd lap. By the time the green flag was waved five laps
later, Zanardi's 24-second lead was down to less than a second.
<p>
But his Honda was obviously the class of the race and he pulled
away and was never challenged again.
<p>
The Budweiser/G.I. Joe's 200 was the ninth of 16 events on the
1996 IndyCar circuit.  It was shortened from its previous length
of 102 laps around the 1.95-mile road course this year. 
<p>
The next IndyCar event is the Grand Prix of Cleveland on June
30.
