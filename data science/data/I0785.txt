    <td><font size="2">Don Robinson appears to have been ousted as the front runner to buy the
    Hull City, BBC Radio Humberside reports. A new consortium is said to have stepped in. The
    Phelan brothers, led by chief accountant, Kevin Phelan is supposed to be acting on its
    behalf.<p>Phelan led negotiations to buy the Tigers before David Lloyd stepped in and the
    man who worked with him, Tim Lloyd's financial aide, Michael Appleton, has spoken of his
    surprise.</p>
    <p>The Phelans, based in Dublin, purchased Doncaster Rovers through off-shore holding
    company Westferry in the Summer. Rovers are having those shares switched over to long time
    Rovers fan and previous director, John Ryan. It is understood that Westferry will help
    Rovers to build a new ground over the next few years whilst it deals with the council over
    the sale of Belle Vue.</p>
    <p>What further complicates and interests in this deal, is that Westferry also bought
    Doncaster Dragons, the rugby league team, and have similar interests in Hull Sharks. </p>
    <p>It is too early yet to see what their intentions are over either deal, and although
    their intentions are not purely for the good of football, they do appear to appreciate the
    art of creating a stable business environment. Altrincham have been turned around into a
    community club, Doncaster Rovers are in the early stages of the same.</font></td>
