Abstract
<p>
We analyse the residuals to the fundamental plane (FP) of elliptical galaxies
as a function of stellar-population indicators; these are based on the 
line-strength parameter Mg2 and on UBVRI broad-band colors, and are
partly derived from new observations. The effect of the stellar populations 
accounts for approximately half the observed variation of the mass-to-light
ratio responsible for the FP tilt. The residual tilt can be explained by the 
contribution of two additional effects: the dependence of the rotational 
support, and possibly that of the spatial structure, on the luminosity. 
<p>
We conclude to a constancy of the dynamical-to-stellar 
mass ratio. This probably extends to globular clusters as well, but
the dominant factor would be here the luminosity dependence of the structure
rather than that of the stellar population. 
This result also 
implies a constancy of the fraction of dark matter over all the scalelength 
covered by stellar systems. Our
