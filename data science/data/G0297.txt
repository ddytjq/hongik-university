<P>
<B>NOTICE:</B> The project that is the subject of this report was approved
by the Governing Board of the National Research Council, whose
members are drawn from the councils of the National Academy of
Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute
of Medicine. The members of the panel responsible for the report
were chosen for their special competences and with regard for
appropriate balance.
<P>
This report has been reviewed by a group other than the authors
according to procedures approved by a Report Review Committee
consisting of members of the National Academy of Sciences, the
National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine.
<P>
The National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonprofit, self-perpetuating
society of distinguished scholars engaged in scientific and engineering
research, dedicated to the furtherance of science and technology
and to their use for the general welfare. Upon the authority of
the charter granted to it by Congress in 1863, the Academy has
a mandate that requires it to advise the federal government on
scientific and technical matters. Dr. Bruce Alberts is president
of the National Academy of Sciences.
<P>
The National Academy of Engineering was established in 1964, under
the charter of the National Academy of Sciences, as a parallel
organization of outstanding engineers. It is autonomous in its
administration and in the selection of its members, sharing with
the National Academy of Sciences the responsibility for advising
the federal government. The National Academy of Engineering also
sponsors engineering programs aimed at meeting national needs,
encourages education and research, and recognizes the superior
achievements of engineers. Dr. Harold Liebowitz is president of
the National Academy of Engineering.
<P>
The Institute of Medicine was established in 1970 by the National
Academy of Sciences to secure the services of eminent members
of appropriate professions in the examination of policy matters
pertaining to the health of the public. The Institute acts under
the responsibility given to the National Academy of Sciences by
its congressional charter to be an advisor to the federal government
and, upon its own initiative, to identify issues of medical care,
research, and education. Dr. Kenneth I. Shine is president of
the Institute of Medicine.
<P>
The National Research Council was established by the National
Academy of Sciences in 1916 to associate the broad community of
science and technology with the Academy's purposes of furthering
knowledge and advising the federal government. Functioning in
accordance with general policies determined by the Academy, the
Council has become the principal operating agency of both the
National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering
in providing services to the government, the public, and the scientific
and engineering communities. The Council is administered jointly
by both Academies and the Institute of Medicine. Dr. Bruce Alberts
and Dr.&nbsp;Harold Liebowitz are chairman and vice chairman,
respectively, of the National Research Council.
