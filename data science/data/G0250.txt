              Hawking's parents lived in London where his father was undertaking 
              research into medicine. However, London was a dangerous place during 
              World War II and Stephen's mother was sent to the safer town of 
              Oxford where Stephen was born. The family were soon back together 
              living in Highgate, north London, where Stephen began his schooling. 
              </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
              1950 Stephen's father moved to the Institute for Medical Research 
              in Mill Hill. The family moved to St Albans so that the journey 
              to Mill Hill was easier. Stephen atte<img src="hawking01.jpg" width="90" height="109" align="left" alt="Stephen Hawking">nded 
              St Albans High School for Girls (which took boys up to the age of 
              10). When he was older he attended St Albans school but his father 
              wanted him to take the scholarship examination to go to Westminster 
              public school. However Stephen was ill at the time of the examinations 
              and remained at St Albans school which he had attended from the 
              age of 11. Stephen writes in [2]:- </font>
            <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>I 
              got an education there that was as good as, if not better than, 
              that I would have had at Westminster. I have never found that my 
              lack of social graces has been a hindrance.</i> </font></blockquote>
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hawking 
            wanted to specialise in mathematics in his last couple of years at 
            school where his mathematics teacher had inspired him to study the 
            subject. However Hawking's father was strongly against the idea and 
            Hawking was persuaded to make chemistry his main school subject. Part 
            of his father's reasoning was that he wanted Hawking to go to University 
            College, Oxford, the College he himself had attended, and that College 
            had no mathematics fellow. </font> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
              March 1959 Hawking took the scholarship examinations with the aim 
              of studying natural sciences at Oxford. He was awarded a scholarship, 
              despite feeling that he had performed badly, and at University College 
              he specialised in physics in his natural sciences degree. He only 
              just made a First Class degree in 1962 and in [1] he explains how 
              the attitude of the time worked against him:- </font>
            <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>The 
              prevailing attitude at Oxford at that time was very anti-work. You 
              were supposed to be brilliant without effort, or accept your limitations 
              and get a fourth-class degree. To work hard to get a better class 
              of degree was regarded as the mark of a grey man - the worst epithet 
              in the Oxford vocabulary.</i> </font></blockquote>
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 
            Oxford, Hawking moved to Cambridge to take up research in general 
            relativity and cosmology, a difficult area for someone with only a 
            little mathematical background. Hawking had noticed that he was becoming 
            rather clumsy during his last year at Oxford and, when he returned 
            home for Christmas 1962 at the end of his first term at Cambridge, 
            his mother persuaded him to see a doctor. </font> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
              early 1963 he spent two weeks having tests in hospital and motor 
              neurone disease (Lou Gehrig's disease) was diagnosed. His condition 
              deteriorated quickly and the doctors predicted that he would not 
              live long enough to complete his doctorate. However Hawking writes:- 
              </font>
            <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>... 
              although there was a cloud hanging over my future, I found to my 
              surprise that I was enjoying life in the present more than I had 
              before. I began to make progress with my research...</i> </font></blockquote>
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
            reason that his research progressed was that he met a girl he wanted 
            to marry and realised he had to complete his doctorate to get a job 
            so:- </font> 
            <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>... 
              I therefore started working for the first time in my life. To my 
              surprise I found I liked it.</i> </font></blockquote>
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 
            completing his doctorate in 1966 Hawking was awarded a fellowship 
            at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. At first his position was 
            that of Research Fellow, but later he became a Professorial Fellow 
            at Gonville and Caius College. In 1973 he left the Institute of Astronomy 
            and joined to the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical 
            Physics at Cambridge. He became Professor of Gravitational Physics 
            at Cambridge in 1977. In 1979 Hawking was appointed Lucasian Professor 
            of Mathematics at Cambridge. The man born 300 years to the day after 
            Galileo died now held Newton's chair at Cambridge. </font> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 
              1965 and 1970 Hawking worked on singularities in the theory of general 
              relativity devising new mathematical techniques to study this area 
              of cosmology. Much of his work in this area was done in collaboration 
              with Roger Penrose who, at that time, was at Birkbeck College, London. 
              From 1970 Hawking began to apply his previous ideas to the study 
              of black holes. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing 
              this work on black holes, Hawking discovered in 1970 a remarkable 
              property. Using quantum theory and general relativity he was able 
              to show that black holes can emit radiation. His success with proving 
              this made him work from that time on combining the theory of general 
              relativity with quantum theory. In 1971 Hawking investigated the 
              creation of the Universe and predicted that, following the big bang, 
              many objects as heavy as 10<sup>9</sup> tons but only the size of 
              a proton would be created. These mini black holes have large gravitational 
              attraction governed by general relativity, while the laws of quantum 
              mechanics would apply to objects that small. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another 
              remarkable achievement of Hawking's using these techniques was his 
              no boundary proposal made in 1983 with Jim Hartle of Santa Barbara. 
              Hawking explains that this would mean:- </font>
            <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>... 
              that both time and space are finite in extent, but they don't have 
              any boundary or edge. ... there would be no singularities, and the 
              laws of science would hold everywhere, including at the beginning 
              of the universe.</i> </font></blockquote>
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
            1982 Hawking decided to write a popular book on cosmology. By 1984 
            he had produced a first draft of <i>A Brief History of Time.</i> However 
            Hawking was to suffer a further illness:- </font> 
            <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>I 
              was in Geneva, at CERN, the big particle accelerator, in the summer 
              of </i>1985<i>. ... I caught pneumonia and was rushed to hospital. 
              The hospital in Geneva suggested to my wife that it was not worth 
              keeping the life support machine on. But she was having none of 
              that. I was flown back to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, where 
              a surgeon called Roger Grey carried out a tracheotomy. That operation 
              saved my life but took away my voice.</i> </font></blockquote>
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hawking 
            was given a computer system to enable him to have an electronic voice. 
            It was with these difficulties that he revised the draft of <i>A Brief 
            History of Time</i> which was published in 1988. The book broke sales 
            records in a way that it would have been hard to predict. By May 1995 
            it had been in <i>The Sunday Times</i> best-sellers list for 237 weeks 
            breaking the previous record of 184 weeks. This feat is recorded in 
            the <i>1998 Guinness Book of Records.</i> Also recorded there is the 
            fact that the paperback edition was published on 6 April 1995 and 
            reached number one in the best sellers in 3 days. By April 1993 there 
            had been 40 hardback editions of <i>A Brief History of Time</i> in 
            the United States and 39 hardback editions in the UK. </font> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of 
              course Hawking has received, and continues to receive, a large number 
              of honours. He was elected a Fellow of The Royal Society in 1974, 
              being one of its youngest fellows. He was awarded the CBE in 1982, 
              and was made a Companion of Honour in 1989. Hawking has also received 
              many foreign awards and prizes and was elected a Member of the National 
              Academy of Sciences of the United States. </font>
