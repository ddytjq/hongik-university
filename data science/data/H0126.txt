the body and the forward movement of the forelimbs is

<ol>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">The body is lifted by the
        pectoralis major muscles which depress the laterally
        projecting humeri and press the forearms and the
        fore-feet against the ground. This pair of muscles is
        attached to sternum, interclavicle and clavicles and
        insert on the proximal parts of the humeri.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">The elbows are flexed by the
        biceps brachii muscles. These muscles originate from the
        biceps tubercle on the coracoid, ventral to the glenoid

</i></b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The birds had
bipedal ancestors which were adapted to live on the ground. In
spite of their bipedality they maintained their forelimbs and
pelvic skeleton unreduced.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The bipedal digitigrady and the
similarity of pelvic and hindlegs of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and
modern birds in general to those of the theropod dinosaurs make
it far-fedged to deny that they had common bipedal ancestors,
presumeably some unspecialized group of early archosaurs (Broom,
1913; Heilmann, 1913, 1926). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">What caused the evolutionary
change from the early quadrupedeal diapsids, the eosuchians, to
the bipedal archosaurs, the thecodonts, is hard to say and any
proposal might be meerely guesswork. Nevertheless a hypothesis to
explain it, shall be forwarded:</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The early diapsides surely have
split up into two lineages: The lepidosaurs, which lineage lead
to the lizards and to the snakes, and the archosaurs, which
lineage lead to the dinosaurs, the crocodiles, and the birds.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is pure guesswork to say what
caused this splitting, but a reasonable hypothesis is that the
source-group of the thecodonts, were eosuchians which lived at
lakes and rivers, chasing fishs by swimming.<br>
They swam in a manner like that of fishs, that is to say
propelling by waving their tails from side to side, and in order
to minimize the resistance of the water they held their limbs
close to their flanks. <br>
When they went out of the water to rest on the banks they
maintained this posture and moved the hindlegs parallelly in a
narrow trackway with their thighs close to the flanks. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This manner of locomotion made it
possible for them to walk on the hindlegs alone with the forepart
of the body off the ground keeping it ballanced by their strong,</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">bipedal walking gave them
essential advantages over the quadrupedal reptiles: It saved
muscular efforts in keeping the body off the ground, and it made
it possible to evolve long legs and digitigrady and thus make
them fast runners. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This new posture changed the
pelvis. The digitigrady and the elongation of the hindlegs and
the simplification of the tarsal joint into a hinge as to be seen
in <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and birds is surely an adaptation to the
bipedal ground-running (Cruickshank &amp; Benton, 1985). See fig.
4.</font></p>

<ol type="A" start="1">
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">The quadrupedal diapsides
        lifted the hind part of the body by muscles,
        pubo-ischio-femoralis externus (pife), which originated
        from the under side of the pubic bone (pu) and the iscium
        bone (is) and inserted on the thigh bone (fe). Another
        muscle, pubo-ischio-femoralis internus (pifi) attached to
        the inner side of the pubic bone and the thigh bone moved
        the leg forwards.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">The thecodonts, which had
        been accustomed to hold the thights close to the flanks
        also when they walked on land, lifted the trunk off the
        ground by turning the hindlegs backwards. For this they
        used the muscles from the underside of the iscium to the
        thigh bone, <i>but also the muscle (pifi) from the upper
        side of the pubic bone to the thigh bone</i>. As an
        adaptation to this movement and to reinforce the latter
        muscle, the pubic bone was bend downwards. Because the
        body was no more supported by the forelimbs, and because
        the entire weight of the body therefore should be carried
        by the hindlegs alone, more vertebrae were included in
        the the synsacrum to tie ilium to the spine, and
        consequently ilium was elongated.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">In the pre-birds the
        pubis-thigh muscle (pifi) was further elongated and
        reinforced as the pubis was elongated and bend obliquely
        to the rear.</font> </li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">In birds the pubis is bend
        completely to the rear and tied to the iscium by tissues.
        To this see Romer, 1923, Halstead, 1969,Charig, 1972, and
        Walker, 1977.)</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Another essential anatomical
change caused as an adaptation to the life at the waters was that
of the skull. In order to breath when swimming, the animal should
hold its</font> <font face="Times New Roman">nostrils out of the
water, and as a means to make that easier, the jaws were
elongated. This elongation might also be caused as a means to
catsh fishes in the waters, a manner of life which also might be
the explanation of the special dentition of the thecodonts, the
single rows of teeth in caves of the jaws; the thecodont
dentition. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The elongation of the jaws caused
the characteristic of the archosaur skull, the pre-orbital
fenestrae. See fig. 5.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The tridactylic foot in the
theropod dinosaurs, <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and in birds in general
with a reduced fifth toe and a reversed first toe is most likely
an evolutionary parallel to the foot of ungulate mammals and an
adaptation to ground-running.</font></p>

behaviour in the early bipedal bird-ancestors.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In the bipedal mode of
locomotion, the forelimbs ceased to support the body. These as
well as the sternum and the clavicles, sites of attachment of the
pectoral muscles, therefore were less important. And according to
the general principle of evolution they consequently should be
reduced and eventually vanish.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the fossil record,
these consequenses properly occured in the carnivore theropods of
which the later forms, e.g. <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, had strongly
reduced forelimbs and no clavicles (Swinton, 1934).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>But as demonstrated above
these consequenses of bipedality did not occur in the avian
lineage!</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In the birds the number of digits
was reduced into three, and the movability and the power of
supination was restricted. But the sternum is retained and
enlarged and the clavicles are reinforced and coalesced with the
transverse parts of the interclavicle into the furcula.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Archaeopteryx</i>, with its
general shape of a coelurosaur, possessed long forelimbs and a
well-developed furcula (Owen, 1863). It is uncertain whether it
possessed a sternum (Petronievies &amp; Woodward, 1917; de Beer,
1954 a) or did not (Ostrom, 1976 b). If it did not, it might have
been a close offshoot from the avian lineage which had abandoned
treeclimbing as well as flying capacity to live by the shores of
Solnhofen.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>The retention of the pectoral

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The novel mode of life which
retained the pectoral girdle and the forelimbs in the lineage of
bipedal pre-birds must have required a qualified use of the
forelimbs and of the pectoral muscles. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Mounting trees in a scansorial
manner requires well-developed forelimbs and strong power of the
pectoral muscles (Yalden, 1985).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is therefore an obvious
hypothesis that bipedal, ground-living bird-ancestors with yet
not reduced pectoral girdle and forelimbs climbed trees in a
scansorial manner.<br>
But as the pelvis and the hindlimbs in <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and
in birds in general are obviously adapted to bipedal running, the
bird-ancestors must have maintained the cursorial manner of life.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>It is therefore proposed as a
working hypothesis that the birds originated from bipedal
reptiles which supplemented a ground-living manner of life with a
habit of climbing trees in a scansorial manner.</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">To justify this hypothesis it is
demonstrated below that the adaptation to such a behaviour
requested a pectoral musculature like that of the quadrupedal
bird-ancestors and forelimbs of an avian structure.<br>
And the hypothesis is further justified as it is demonstrated
that the tree-mounting behaviour may have caused the evolution of
other avian characteristics. </font></p>

a long tail they kept the body in balance.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">At an early bipedal stage, when
the forelimbs and the pectoral girdle was yet not reduced, these
pre-birds for some reason occasionally mounted trees in a
scansorial manner.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">By this mode of climbing the
pre-bird had to push itself upwards by its hindlegs, moving one
leg at the time, while it hooked to the tree-trunk with the claws
of the forward toes. And it had to cling to the tree with its
laterally outstretched forelimbs in order not to tumble over in
behind. Due to the relatively long hindlegs and the saggital
stance, it should hold the body in an oblique angle against the
tree-trunk. See fig. 7.</font></p>

As the pre-bird mounted, both its forelimbs should be moved <i>simultaneously</i>
in lateral swings, i.e. forwardly in relation to the body, to
take higher grips. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Most likely the pre-birds
descended from the trees in a head-down manner like that of
modern tree-living reptiles and squirrels.<br>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, the hooking grip of the
forelimbs was preformed by the same muscles, pectoralis major and
biceps brachii, which the quadrupedal bird-ancestors used to lift
the forepart of the body. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Consequently, the adaptation to a
tree-mounting behaviour gave new function to the forelimbs and to
the pectoralis major and the biceps brachii muscles. And the
adaptation to this behaviour prevented the reduction of the bony
attachment of these muscles, i.e. the sternum, the interclavicle
and the clavicles.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Therefore, the hypothesis that
ground-living pre-birds supplemented their cursorial behaviour
with occassional tree-mounting offers a rational explanation of
the retention of the pectoral girdle in birds.</i></font></p>

</b>The tree-mounting activities of the bipedal pre-birds
demanded additional efforts of the pectoralis major muscles as
these were respondsible for holding the entire weight of the body
to the trunk.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This increased the inward
pressure of the shoulders against the chest, which pressure had
to be resisted by the Y-shaped interclavicle/clavicle structure. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This bony structure, which was
inherited from the quadrupedal diapside reptiles, therefore
should be retained and reinforced as the transverse parts of the
interclavicle coalesced with the clavicles into the avian
furcula. This novel bony element is to be seen in <i>Archaeopteryx</i>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The furcula is transmitted to
birds in which it serves partly as a means to stabilize the
shoulder joints (Sy, 1936), and partly as a reinforcement of the
attachment for the enlarged flight-muscles, the pectoralis major
muscles (Olson &amp; Feduccia, 1979).</font></p>

</b>In the quadrupedal bird-ancestors, the elbow flexed
downwardly. But as an improvement of the climbing ability the
elbow should flex forward. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The adaptation to the climbing
behaviour therefore enforced an axial twist of the humerus, and
subsequently a forward migration of the biceps tubercle, site of
adhersion of the biceps brachii muscle. This migration improved
the direction of the pull of this muscle and maximized its
effect.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The forward migration of the
biceps tubercle occured as the anterior part of the coracoid was
twisted so that the biceps tubercle was removed anteriorly to the
glenoid.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">When the pre-birds descended from
trees, head down, their body-weight for a greater part was
carried by the forelimbs. These should in a restrained backward
movement be hooked into the tree-trunk. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Such a restriction had to be
performed by the supracoracoideus muscle which used to pull the
forelimb forward in the quadrupedal bird-ancestors. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The twist of the coracoid and the
forward migration of the biceps brachii muscle and the biceps
tubercle, enlarged the said muscle. Moreover, its angle of action
became more efficient (Fig. 9 B - C). </font></p>

</b>The scansorial manner of climbing required a flex of the
wrist only in the lateral plane. But this flex should be
performed posteriorly in the ulnar direction &quot;the ulnar
abduction&quot; (Schestakowa, 1927). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Accordingly, the power of
supination could be restricted, and the carpals could coalesce,
forming a strong, simplified wrist-joint.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">For transitional stages, see
Ostrom (1976 a). The forelimbs of coelurosaurs, <i>Struthiomimus</i>
(Gregory, 1917), <i>Deinonynchus</i> (Ostrom, 1969) and <i>Archaeopteryx
</i>(Ostrom, 1975 a) correspond to this intermediate structure of
forelimb.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The adaptation to the
tree-mounting behaviour required an increased power of adhersion.
This caused movability in the palmar plane of the first digit. In
the upward climbing the first digit should be directed forwardly
while the other fingers should be outwardly directed. In the
downward climbing the first digit should be directed outwardly
and the other fingers directed backwards. See fig. 7 B.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Besides the manner of climbing
caused that the second and the third metacarpals and digits were
elongated and coalesced in order to transform the hand into one
long, double-pointed hook. <br>
And the digits had to be furnished with strong, hook-shaped
claws. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Hands with digits of this
structure are to be seen in <i>Archeaeopteryx</i>, the forelimb
claws of which were fit for this manner of climbing (Yalden,
1985).</font></p>

</b>The hypotized tree-mounting behaviour of the pre-birds
required increased power of the pelvic-femoral muscles as these,
one leg at the time, had to carry the entire weight of the body
upwards.<br>
Also the performance of an onset from the side of the tree trunk
and the spring-effect of the hindlegs, which should absorb the
impact of the jump, required increased muscle powers. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Adaptation to a tree-mounting
behaviour therefore might have enforced the evolution of the
backward rotation of the pubis as it changed the pubo-femoralis
muscles from protractors into retractors. This increased the push
effect of the femur (Charic, 1972).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Elongation of the ilium should
also be needed as an adaptation to the the tree-mounting and
down-jumping behavior as it reinforced the ilio-femoral- and the
ilio-trochanterius muscles.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Moreover, an elongation of ilium
incorporated more vertebrae into the synsacrum which reinforced
the pelvis and made it better apt to resist the impact when the
down-jumping pre-bird hit the ground.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">A pelvis with backward rotated
pubis is to be seen in <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and in birds. An
elongated ilium and a synsacrum with a great number of
incorporated vertebrae is a general characteristic of birds. See

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The functional hindtoe, hallux, a

</b>When a quadrupedal reptile like <i>Sphenodon</i> and surely
the quadrupedal bird-ancestors moved, the forepart of the body is
suspended between the broad scapulae in the serrati muscles.
These muscles adher to the scapulae and insert anteriorly on the
ribs (Fig. 10 A). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The lateral sides of the scapulae
are the sites of adhersion of the deltoid muscles, the main
function of which is to raise the forelimbs. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">At the bipedal stage the
forelimbs did not support the body, but came to hang suspended in
the trapezius muscles which are fan-like attached to the neck and
back of the animal and insert on the acromial parts of the
scapulae and the upper parts of the clavicles.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">As the raise of the forelimbs at
this stage was of little need and the function of the deltoid
muscles consequently could be reduced, the scapulae could be
reduced. The narrow shape of scapulae in dinosurs, <i>Archaeopteryx</i>
and the birds in general, is a consequense of bipedality (Fig. 10
B).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">By the tree-mounting behaviour
the body of pre-birds again should hang between the scapulae.
When the pre-bird climbed up, the gravity pulled it backwards so
that its body hung suspended in the posterior parts of the
serrati- and trapezius muscles. These muscles therefore evolved
into the peculiar serratus superficialis- and rhomboidius
superficialis muscles in birds (Fig. 10 D).</font></p>

</b>The unique structure of the pectoral skeleton, the forelimbs,
the pelvis and the hindlimbs in <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and birds as
well as the peculiar structure of the avian serrati-rhomboid
musculature, is a justification - not to say verification - of
the hypothesis that bipedal bird-ancestors supplemented a
ground-living manner of life with a tree-mounting behaviour. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">From what is demonstrated above
follows that as an adaptation to a tree-mounting</font> <font
face="Times New Roman">behaviour the bipedal pre-birds acquired
the anatomical prerequisits for the subsequent evolution of
powered flight, namely a pectoral skeleton with a broad sternum
and a interclavicle/clavicle structure as site of adhersion of
the strong pectoralis major muscles which in birds perform the
downstrokes in flapping flight.</font> <font
face="Times New Roman">Besides, the adaptation to tree-mounting
behaviour transformed the coracoid with the biceps tubercle
situated in front of the glenoid and the site of the
supracoracoideus muscle so that it performs the forward pull of
the humerus around the biceps tubercle as a pulley.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Due to the oblique orientation of
the body axis of the down-jumping pre-bird the movement which the
supracoracoideus muscle performed became an almost upward
directed movement, homologous with the upstroke in flying birds. </font></p>
