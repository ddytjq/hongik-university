<p>In Alberta, 'Pertussis Season' is about as predictable as snow in the winter and this year is no
exception. The number of specimens submitted to the Provincial Laboratory have increased from an
average of 200 per month in the early summer this year to over 650 in September. Generally, about
20% of the specimens are positive by DFA and/or culture.</p>

<p>Along with increased sampling come many questions with regard to collection, laboratory processing
and reporting of specimens submitted for Pertussis investigation. In this newsletter we have
attempted to answer some of your questions and address a variety of concerns that have been raised.</p>

<h4>1. <A NAME="When to submit">  When should a specimen be submitted for pertussis investigation?</A></h4>
<p>Pertussis is a notifiable disease. It is highly communicable, especially in an unimmunized
population, and outbreak management depends upon timely notification of Public Health
officials (MOH in your Regional Health Authority) when a case is suspected and/or
confirmed by the laboratory.</P>

<p>A clinical or suspect case is defined as a patient who has any of the following:

<UL>
<LI> paroxysmal cough
<LI> inspiratory whoop for which there is no other known cause
<LI> cough ending in vomiting or associated with apnea with no other known cause
</UL>
<p>For patients presenting with the above symptoms, a nasopharyngeal swab should be collected
for culture and a direct smear prepared for DFA .</p>
<p>Pertussis is typically a childhood disease, however illness in adults is becoming more
common, possibly due to waning immunity. The disease is less severe in older patients, but
since it represents a reservoir for infection of young children, diagnosis and treatment is
important. A cough of longer than two weeks duration is typical of pertussis in older patients.</p>

<p>	The use of antibiotics (erythromycin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) may have little
affect on the clinical course of the disease once symptoms are present, but chemoprophylaxis
reduces shedding of the bacteria, thus limiting the spread of the disease. Antibiotic therapy
should be initiated promptly to minimize secondary spread. <strong>There is no need to culture
asymptomatic contacts prior to prescribing chemoprophylaxis.</strong></p>

<p><FONT  SIZE=+1 COLOR="#FF0000"><strong>Specimens should be submitted <u>ONLY</u> from contacts who are <u>SYMPTOMATIC</u>.
<p>Sampling asymptomatic contacts is not appropriate or useful.</strong></FONT>

<h4>2. <A NAME="Why use special media"> Why do we have to use special transport media for Pertussis culture?</A></h4>

<p><em>Bordetella pertussis</em>, the causative agent of whooping cough, is very fastidious. It is a tiny
gram-negative organism that is very sensitive to drying, environmental toxins and fatty 
acids. The medium that is recommended for optimum recovery of <em>B. pertussis</em> is Regan Lowe
Transport Media (RLTM). It contains charcoal to absorb toxins that may be present in the
sample, horse blood to enhance the viability of the organism and cephalexin to inhibit the
growth of the normal oropharyngeal flora that will also be present in the sample.</p>

<p><h4>3. <A NAME="How important is the expiry date"> How important is the expiry date of the transport media?</A></h4>

<p>Very important!  The horse blood and cephalexin that are used to prepare RLTM are not
stable over a long period of time.  Blood will deteriorate to produce substances that can be
toxic to the organism. In addition, the inhibitory action of the antibiotic is lost over time
allowing the normal oropharyngeal flora that are contaminating the specimen, to produce
metabolic byproducts that are toxic to pertussis.</p>

<p><strong>The shelf life of this media is just eight weeks</strong> and therefore it is important to monitor the
supply and ensure that new kits are ordered to replace those that are nearing their expiry date.
Swabs that are received in RLTM that exceed the expiry date by  one month will not be
processed.</p>


<p>Amies charcoal transport media also carries an expiry date, although the shelf life is
considerably longer than that of RLTM. <strong>Culture results of specimens submitted in
outdated media will be compromised, regardless of the type of micro-organism targeted
for investigation.</strong></p>


<h4>4. <A NAME="How to order RL kits"> How do I order Pertussis kits containing Regan Lowe Transport Media?</A></h4>

<p>Pertussis kits can be ordered through the Provincial Laboratory Distribution 
  Centre. Orders can be telephoned to (780) 407 - 8971, or can be submitted using 
  the form that is designed for this purpose.</p>


<h4>5. <A NAME="What if we don't have a pertussis kit"> What do we do if we don't have a Pertussis kit?</A></h4>

<p>If you do not have a Pertussis kit available, the swab may be submitted in Amies charcoal
transport medium. This medium is not as good as RLTM and the quality of the culture result
may be compromised.</p>

<p>Do not submit dry swabs (i.e. one that has not been immersed in transport medium) or use
clear transport media. The organism will not survive in a dry environment, and the toxins
present in the sample will not be inhibited if the transport medium lacks charcoal. These
specimens will not be processed.</p>
<p>Nasopharyngeal swabs that are made of calcium alginate or dacron should be used for
specimen collection. Cotton swabs are toxic to the organism because of the fatty acids that
are present.</p>


<h4>6. <A NAME="Labelling specimens"> Why do we have to label both the slide and the bottle containing the swab when both
are sent together?  <BR>How should we label them?</A></h4>

<p>Specimens that are submitted for pertussis investigation will consist of a swab in RLTM and
two slides. When these samples are received, they are sorted for processing. The RLTM are
processed separately from the slides. The slides are removed from the transport container for
staining. Therefore, labeling the slide container does not provide patient identification for the
entire sample (i.e. the slides or the swab). <BR><strong>PLEASE LABEL EACH ITEM.  Please use a
pencil to label the frosted end of the slides</strong>.<BR> The staining process dissolves ink and glue so
the use of a pen or adhesive labels on the slides is not useful.</p>


<h4>7. <A NAME="Storage of Collected Specimens"> What do we do with the sample if it cannot be sent to the Provincial Lab the same day as it is collected?</A></h4>

<p>Because growth of bacteria other than <em>B. pertussis</em> can produce toxic byproducts, the
transport media should be held at 4<sup>o</sup>C prior to transport. Rapid transport to the laboratory will
enhance the recovery of pertussis in culture.</p>

<p><h3><A NAME="Laboratory Handling">Laboratory Handling</A>:</h3>

<h4>8. <A NAME="DFA Reliability"> What about the DFA? Why do we do it? It is reliable?</A></h4>
<p>Detection of organisms by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing depends upon the
binding of a fluorescein-labeled antibody to the cell surface of the target organism. The
commercial DFA reagents that were traditionally used for this test were polyclonal. That is,
antisera were prepared using a vaccine consisting of a killed whole cell suspension of
pertussis organisms. Consequently the antibodies that were produced in response to the
vaccine, were directed against many different antigens (or epitopes) present on the cell
surface. Thus the chance of cross-reactivity with organisms, other than pertussis, that might
also carry any one of these antigens was significant.</p>

<p> For the past three years, the Provincial Laboratory has used a monoclonal DFA reagent. Monoclonal antibodies are directed against a single antigen, in this case a lipooligosaccharide epitope, on the surface of the <em>B. pertussis</em>
cell. Because this antigen is species-specific, cross-reactivity should not occur.</P>
<p> The specificity of the <em>B. pertussis</em> DFA using this monoclonal reagent has been reported to be as
high as 99% when compared to culture, the traditional gold standard.</p>		

<p>The advantages of the DFA over culture include detection of organisms that are not viable
and the ability to provide a rapid test result. It has the disadvantage of low sensitivity since
there must be a sufficient number of organisms present in the smear to be visualized on
microscopic examination.</p>		

<p><strong>The DFA is a diagnostic test </strong>and not a screening tool. This means that it has value only in
a population where there is a <strong>high prevalence of disease</strong>. It must, therefore be applied only
to <strong>patients who present a clinical picture that is consistent with pertussis</strong>. </P>
<p>When this test is used in a low prevalence population, that is, one in which symptoms of disease are absent,
its positive predictive value for diagnosis of pertussis  may be low.</p>	

<h4>9. <A NAME="How long does it take to get a DFA result"> How long does it take to get a DFA result?</A></h4>

<p>At the Provincial Laboratory, the turn around time (TAT) for tests that involve examination
of a direct smear, including the DFA, is 24 hours after the specimen is received in the
laboratory. Every effort is made to meet this TAT, however  it is possible that specimens that
are received on weekends, when staffing levels are reduced, may exceed this target.</p>


<h4>10. <A NAME="How long does it take for pertussis culture"> How long does it take to complete a Pertussis culture?</A></h4>

<p><em>B. pertussis </em>is a very slow growing organism with fastidious nutritional requirements.
Colonies may become visible after 72 hours incubation, however many strains take longer
to grow. Positive results are reported as soon as the organism is recovered and its
identification is confirmed. All cultures are held seven days before being reported as
negative.</p>		

<p><em>Bordetella parapertussis</em> grows more rapidly than <em>B. pertussis</em>, and growth may be evident
after as few as two days incubation.</p>	

<h3><A NAME="Reporting of B. pertussis">Reporting</A>:</h3>

<h4>11. <A NAME="What if the DFA is positive and the culture is negative"> What does a positive DFA result mean, if the culture is negative?</A></h4>

<p>The DFA will detect organisms regardless of whether or not they are viable. A negative
culture result may be due to loss of viability rather than absence of the organism. A specimen
for which a positive DFA is reported in combination with a negative culture can result from
several situations:	

<UL>
<LI><p>			Patients treated with antibiotics prior to sampling
<LI><p>			Patients who are past the catarrhal or early paroxysmal stage of disease
<LI><p>			Specimens taken with a cotton tip swab
<LI><p>			Specimens that have been delayed in transit
<LI><p>			Specimens submitted in outdated transport medium
</UL>

<p>If the DFA is positive in a patient with clinical symptoms of pertussis, the result is likely a
true positive, regardless of the culture result. A positive DFA result in an asymptomatic
patient who is culture negative is difficult to interpret, and is probably not clinically useful.</p>	

<h4>12. <A NAME="Why is the DFA negative if the culture is positive"> Why is the DFA negative if the culture was positive?</A></h4>

<p>Since the DFA depends upon the presence of a sufficient number of organisms to be
visualized in the microscopic examination, specimens in which there are only a few
organisms present will be DFA negative. This is why the DFA lacks sensitivity and should
never be used alone to rule out a diagnosis of pertussis.</p>

<h4>13. <A NAME="Are positive reports telephoned"> Are positive reports telephoned?</A></h4>

<p>Since pertussis is a notifiable disease and prompt follow up action is required to control
secondary spread, <strong>all positive pertussis reports are telephoned to both the submitting
agency and the Regional Health Authority Public Health Services.</strong> If the specimen has
been submitted to the Provincial Laboratory indirectly, via a private laboratory system,
positive results will be telephoned to the attending physician's office.</p>		

<p>In order to contact the appropriate Regional Health Authority, we must know where the
patient resides. Please include the <strong>home address, including the city or town of residence,
for the patient</strong> on the requisition that is submitted with the specimen.</p>


<p>The earliest report to be telephoned will be a positive DFA. If the culture result for these
DFA positive specimens is also positive, the culture result will NOT be telephoned.</p>


<p>Positive culture results on specimens that were DFA negative are telephoned as soon as they
are available.</p>	

<p>We hope that we have answered some of your questions. Please feel free to contact us at any time
if you have comments or concerns. We are pleased to receive all suggestions that will enhance our
service.</p>
