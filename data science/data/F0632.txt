these books are extremely focussed in what they cover. The result is another 
great book not only for learning purposes but also as a quick reference. Anyone 
who uses DTS or wishes to learn more should read this book. </P>
<P>The book begins with a discussion of DTS and how it fits in with the many 
different technologies available with a discussion of what it can be used for 
and what it cannot be used for. This is followed by an explanation how a DTS 
package is constructed and the use of the graphical designer. The concept of 
Tasks as individual work units within a DTS package is then developed with a 
detailed discussion of the various Tasks and their uses. The use of tasks to 
create workflows forms the bulk of the book. Various types of package 
implementations are discussed together with how packages can be scheduled. </P>
<P>The second part of the book deals with automating DTS using Visual Basic. 
There are various examples given in the book of how this is done. This section 
was a bit short to my liking even though the authors did discuss the more common 
applications that can be developed using the DTS objects. </P>
<P>The third part of the book discusses data warehousing and data mining using 
DTS and Analysis Services. Again I wish this part could have gone into slightly 
more detail but I guess you cannot have it all. </P>
<P>The final part of the book deals with various case studies which are 
basically step-by-step instructions of how real world solutions were built using 
DTS. I found this part to be invaluable as a learning tool. However I will point 
out that all the examples and code samples in the book are only available by 
downloading them through the New Riders website or the authors’ website. </P>
<P>My conclusion? This is a great book for learning about a tool which isn’t 
used as often as it should be. Maybe if people read it, they will understand 
exactly how useful Data Transformation Services can be! </P></TD></TR></Table>
