[This file is intended to be a summary or an extended abstract.   It is basically a condensed version of Essay #3.   There is a "by the numbers" quick derivation of a model other than the conventional open-flat-closed Friedmann models.   This model is already in the cosmological inventory, but is one of the more esoteric ones<strong>:</strong> the FRW (Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) metric.  The main series of essays simply fill in the details of the overlooked model derived here.

<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The foundations of non-Euclidean geometry were laid by such eminent nineteenth century mathematicians as Gauss, Lobachevsky, Bolyai, Riemann, and Clifford.   But the most interest in non-Euclidean geometry occurred the third decade of the twentieth century when an unknown Prussian mathematician Theodor Kaluza noted that the existence of a fourth spatial dimension would unify Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism with Einstein's theory of gravity.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Although a fourth spatial dimension has traditionally has been assumed to exist the way it is described in string theory - so small we don't notice it in our Euclidean world - there is current interest in the possibility of at least one more "large" or "uncompactified" spatial dimension in theoretical physics. <a href="#ref">[1,2]</a>   Surprisingly it appears that no one has bothered to show how a large fourth spatial dimension can be incorporated into the "standard big bang 
cosmology".
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>There is, however, a significant caveat: a "large" fourth spatial dimension cannot behave like the first three spatial dimensions or our physical world would not behave the way it does.   Light intensity, gravity, and magnetism, which vary as the inverse square of the distance in a three-dimensional world would vary as the inverse cube of the distance if a "large" fourth spatial dimension behaved like the first three.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The assumed "size" of a large dimension in physics generally means anything larger than the very small measure in string theory, but in many articles there seems to be an upper limit to the size of this dimension.   For example, about a millimeter (or fraction thereof) is typically mentioned as a "large" dimension if it is associated with suspected gravitational anomalies.     
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>But I will derive a "large" fourth spatial dimension in a slightly different context by answering these questions: 
<blockquote>
<OL>
<LI>How is it possible for a "large" fourth spatial dimension to exist in a way that causes the three easily recognized spatial dimensions, which obviously seem orthogonal nearby, to lose their apparent orthogonal relationship on a global scale?
<p>
<LI>What specific topological assumptions in standard cosmology do we make to get a Riemannian hypersphere instead of the conventional open-flat-closed Friedmann universes?   
<p>
<LI>And why would we want to make those assumptions?     
</OL>
</blockquote>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>I will answer these questions by presenting an easy to follow argument in topology and will assume ideal conditions.   For instance, it is well known that the early universe is opaque to light transmission for the first few hundred thousand years, and the following derivation ignores that restriction. 
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>To begin, suppose we have an elastic structure expanding according to the Hubble parameter H (km/sec/mpc), where kilometers and seconds are self explanatory and a megaparsec is equal to 3.26 million light years.   Two of these terms - kilometers and megaparsecs - are length which cancel each other out dimensionally, leaving only the sec<sup>-1</sup> term.   So if the only 
thing we knew about the expanding structure was the Hubble parameter, the first thing we could derive is that (1) it has been expanding for 1/H seconds, and this is its "age".
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Then let's assume that light propagates at the usual 300,000 km/sec (symbol: c) along or through this elastically expanding structure.   This assumption allows us to derive two other key global characteristics: (2) the distance to the collapsed receding site is c/H and, if we could actually look out this far, we would see the elastic structure as it was 1/H seconds ago and 
(3) this collapsed dimensionless receding site would be receding at the speed of light c (and so we can't look out as far as we'd like to because we can't see anything receding at the speed of light, particularly something that is geometrically dimensionless).
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>While the speed of light is a constant, the Hubble parameter is not.   In an accelerating universe, the values of H increase as time increases.   The two parameters which affect the Hubble "constant" are relative density (<font face=symbol>W</font><sub>m</sub>) and the 
cosmological constant (<font face=symbol>W</font><sub><font face=symbol>L</font></sub>).  The two <font face=symbol>W</font>s obviously affect its "age" in (1) and the look back time in (2).   But since they have no bearing on the topological argument showing how to derive a large fourth spatial dimension, they will be ignored in further discussion.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Now (1) the "age", (2) look back time of c/H, and (3) the receding velocity c of the collapsed site occur regardless of what the global geometry is.   Up to this point, no geometric constraints have been considered.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>So let's add one: the Hubble parameter occurs on and our light geodesics are confined to a spherical surface defined by 
<p>
<center>Equation 1: x<sup>2</sup>(t) + y<sup>2</sup>(t) + z<sup>2</sup>(t) = r<sup>2</sup>(t)</center>
<p>
where (x,y,z) are the dependent variables (dimensions), r is the radius, and the time parameter t allows the radius to change as we look or travel around the spherical surface.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Before we proceed any further, it's necessary to introduce some topological "lingo": if we're referring to a phenomenon that occurs along the (positively curved) circumference it occurs in S-type space - "S" as in "surface" - but if we're referring to something that occurs along the radius, it occurs in V-type space - "V" as in "volume".
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>No matter what the geometry is, the three global characteristics are unaffected: (1) the "age" of the spherical surface is still 1/H; (2) even though we have to look "round and round" an ever smaller surface, the distance to the collapsed site is still c/H, and (3) the collapsed site - the actual center of the sphere - is still receding at c.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Note that our positively curved light geodesics along the surface (in S<sup>2</sup>) and the global behavior of all loci (that is, the positions which satisfy the equation at a certain time t in V<sup>3</sup>) reach the collapsed site at the same time, when t = 0, but by different routes.   Our geodesics reach that site along the shrinking circumference in S<sup>2</sup>, while the loci get there along the shrinking radius in V<sup>3</sup>.   This explains how we could look past any particular locus on the surface and still have that locus defined geometrically to also exist at the collapsed receding site.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>(As already mentioned, we can't see anything that is receding at the speed of light.   On the other hand, it's possible to make reasonable inferences about how the surface would behave at the theoretical collapsed receding t = 0 position.   We know for sure it's there - the Hubble parameter tells us it's there - although we also know for sure we won't ever "see" it in a physical sense.) 
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Is it possible to modify this geometry and still have our geodesics and loci reach the collapsed site at the same time, when t = 0?   For example if we removed the z term in the above equation, would our light geodesics and loci arrive at the collapsed site simultaneously if both are restricted to (x,y,t) in V<sup>2</sup>?
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The conventional Friedmann models assume that our geodesics and global expansion occur in the same type of space (x,y,z,t) in V<sup>3</sup> which may, or may not, be curved by the two <font face=symbol>W</font>s.   But we look past all loci when t &gt; 0 at the speed of light.   So when time is reversed how do these loci reach the collapsed receding t = 0 site (aka the "singularity") if they are restricted to the same space in which our geodesics occur?
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The simplest model which allows both our geodesics and all loci to collapse to zero size at the same time is a Riemannian hypersphere defined by 
<p>
<center>Equation 2: x<sup>2</sup>(t) + y<sup>2</sup>(t)  + z<sup>2</sup>(t) + w<sup>2</sup>(t) = r<sup>2</sup>(t)</center> 
<p>
This model assumes that our geodesics are confined to the "surface" or "circumference" of a four-dimensional Riemannian hypersphere in S<sup>3</sup>, while the global expansion of all loci relative to the collapsed receding site are confined along the radius in V<sup>4</sup>.   It's nothing more than the geometric behavior of a spherical surface in S<sup>2</sup>/V<sup>3</sup>  extrapolated into S<sup>3</sup>/V<sup>4</sup>.   Both geodesics and loci collapse to zero size at the singularity, but reach that unique position in different types of space when time is reversed.   Equation 1 is, in fact, a legitimate solution of Equation 2 when w = 0; it's an "embedded" spherical surface in a higher-dimensional hypersphere. 
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The inclusion of the w term is the "large" fourth spatial dimension and changes the nature of space from Friedmann space to Riemannian space (or what a cosmologist would call the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker or FRW metric).   It gives us the long suspected and often hypothesized "finite but unbounded" model within the standard big bang cosmology.   Although it's possible to look "round and round" such space via a very high number of circuits as we look back in time, what evidence there is suggests that we look around it just once. 
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The principle can be reduced to the following simple statement in topology: if all loci when t &gt; 0 in any elastic structure expanding according to the Hubble parameter H also exist at the farther collapsed site when t = 0 at 1/H seconds ago that we necessarily look toward, then what appears at first to be an orthogonal V<sup>n</sup> structure is actually a positively curved S<sup>n</sup> structure with an undetected spatial dimension. 
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>When the singularity is referred to, are the vague attributes - such as "whole universe" or "entire universe" at the beginning of time - consistent with the condition above that indicates the existence of a large undetected (so far) fourth spatial dimension?   Whether you agree or disagree, at least now you know the topological thinking which gives us a large fourth spatial dimension.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>So if we want a model in which our light geodesics and loci reach the singularity at the same time when time t is reversed, a large fourth spatial dimension in a Riemannian hypersphere (aka FRW metric) solves a problem that seems to exist in the more familiar open-flat-closed Friedmann models.
