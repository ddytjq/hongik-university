<h2>What is Spectroscopy</h2></font>
<p>
Spectroscopy is a very important tool in astronomy. 
It is detailed study of the light from an object.
Light is energy that moves through space and can be thought of as either waves 
or particles.  The distances between the peaks of the waves of light are called
the light's wavelength.
Light is made up of many different wavelengths.  
For example, visible light has wavelengths of about 1/10th of a micrometer - 
ten thousand wavelengths would be the width of a dime.
<p>
Spectrometers are instruments which spread light out into its wavelengths
creating a spectra.  Within this spectra, astronomers can study
emission and absorption lines which are the fingerprints of atoms
and molecules.
An emission line occurs when an electron drops down to a lower orbit around
the nucleus of an atom and looses energy.
An absorption line occurs when electrons move
to a higher orbit by absorbing energy.  Each atom has a unique spacing of
orbits and can emit or absorb only certain energies or wavelengths.  
This is why the location and spacing of spectral lines is unique for
each atom.
<p>
Astronomers can learn a great deal about an object in space by studying its
spectrum, such as it's composition (what its made of), temperature, density,
and it's motion (both it's rotation as well as how fast it is moving towards or away from us).
<p>
There are three types of spectra which an object can emit: continuous, 
emission and absorption spectra.  The examples of these types of spectra 
shown below are for visible light as it is spread out from purple to red,
but the concept is the same for any region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

<h3>Continuous spectra</h3></font>
Continuous spectra (also called a thermal or blackbody spectra) are emitted by
any object that radiates heat (has a temperature).
The light is spread out into a continuous
band with every wavelength having some amount of radiation.  For example,
when sunlight is passed through a prism, it's light is spread out into 
it's colors.

<h3>Absorption spectra</h3></font>
If you look more closely at the Sun's spectrum, you
will notice the presence of dark lines.  These lines are caused by the Sun's
atmosphere absorbing light at certain wavelengths, causing the intensity
of the light at this wavelength to drop and appear dark.  
The atoms and molecules in a gas will absorb only certain wavelengths of light.
The pattern of these lines is unique to each element and tells us what 
elements make up the atmosphere of the Sun.  
We usually see absorption spectra from regions in space where a cooler gas
lies between us and a hotter source.  We usually see absorption spectra
from stars, planets with atmospheres, and galaxies.

<h3>Emission spectra</h3></font>
An emission spectra occurs when the atoms and molecules
in a hot gas emit extra light at certain wavelengths, causing bright lines
to appear in a spectra.  As with absorption spectra, the pattern of these
lines are unique for each element.  We can see emission spectra from comets,
nebula and certain types of stars.

In practice, astronomers rarely look at spectra the way they are displayed
in the above images.  Instead they study plots of intensity, signal or flux
versus wavelength.
These plots show how much light is present or absent at
each wavelength.  A peak in the plot shows the position of an emission line
and dip shows where an absorption line is.  The spacing and location of 
these lines are unique to each atom and molecule. 
<p>
The shape of the 
continuous spectra (often refered to as the continuum)
on a plot is dependent on temperature and motion of the emitting gas. 
In this simple
plot it is shown as a flat line - in reality it is usually a curved line.
Also, many of the real data plots you will see have the wavelength or
frequency on a logarithmic scale.
