"The key results are:<br><blockquote>
<li>Supermassive black holes are so common, nearly every large galaxy
has one.
<li>A black hole's mass is proportional to the mass of the host galaxy, so
that, for example, a galaxy twice as massive as another would have a black
hole that is also twice as massive. This discovery suggests that the
growth of the black hole is linked to the formation of the galaxy in which
it is located. 
<li>The number and masses of the black holes found are consistent with
what would have been required to power the quasars."</blockquote>

it became one of the brightest stars in the southern sky."

Kaufmann, William J. III; <u>The Cosmic Frontiers of General
Relativity</u>; Little, Brown and Company, Boston
<a name="sup1">1: page 287 of <u>The Cosmic Frontiers of General
Relativity</u>:<blockquote>
"Indeed, only those primordial black holes with masses greater than a few
billion tons (10<sup>15</sup> grams) could have survived up to the present
time.  Therefore, if scientists ever find primordial black holes in space,
they would be at least as massive as a typical asteroid yet probably no
bigger than an atom.  These very tiny objects would be recognized because
they emit incredible amounts of energy, probably in the form of very
"hard" gamma rays."</blockquote>   
<p>
Tiny, light, and hot as---er, yeah.  I imagine they'd be real easy to
spot.  Most emitters of gamma rays are <i>not</i> that small.
<p>
<a name="sup2">2: page 286 of <u>The Cosmic Frontiers of General
Relativity</u>:<blockquote>
"The total amount of energy released during the final second of
evaporation is equivalent to a <i>billion megaton hydrogen
bombs!</i>"</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="sup3">3: Page 285 of <u>The Cosmic Frontiers of General
Relativity</u>:<blockquote>
"Consequently, these quantum-mechanical effects discovered by Hawking are
totally unimportant in massive black holes..&#60reference to a
figure&#62...Black holes whose masses are greater than the mass of the
earth
have temperatures less than a tenth of a degree above absolute
zero."</blockquote>
Considering that the cosmic background radiation is &#177 2&#176 or 3&#176
Kelvin, I figured it's miniscule by comparison, since most black holes
have masses much greater than that of the earth.
<p>
<a name="sup4">4: page 156 of <u>The Cosmic Frontiers of General
Relativity</u>:<blockquote>
"In 1975 a team of scientists from Berkeley and Houston announced that
they had discovered a <i>magnetic monopole</i> in one of their
experiments."</blockquote>
I think it was a fluke experiment like the room-temperature fusion
experiment. Ah, well.
<p>
<a name="sup5">5: page 159 of (I must really have enjoyed this book)
<u>The Cosmic Frontiers of General Relativity</u>:<blockquote>
"This condition violates the famous "law of cosmic censorship" proposed by
Roger Penrose.  This idea states that "Thou shalt not have naked
singularities!"
</blockquote>
Hmm.  Well, since no one can describe with any accuracy what a singularity
looks like (and perhaps because the curvature of spacetime is infinite),
physicists get nervous when told that such things can exist in the Real
World.  Fair enough.  I'd get nervous tremors if I had to describe
something that had not a steady shape but a selection of
<i>possible</i> shapes.
<p>
<a name="sup6">6: page 181 of <u>The Cosmic Frontiers of
Relativity</u>:<blockquote>
"In 1974,[sic] Kip S. Thorne published realistic calculations involving
black holes.  He showed that, under reasonable circumstances, a black hole
would be expected to be rotating at the special or <i>canonical</i> value
of <i>a = 99.8&#37 M.</i>  This is very rapid indeed."</blockquote>
This means that the two event horizons are practically on top of one
another.  Someone could survive a trip through 'em both (not considering
the <a href="inside.html#blue">blue sheet</a>, of course).  This also
means that the ergosphere of a typical rotating black hole really billows
out, which is very useful for finding such a black hole, I think.
<p>
<a name="sup7">7: page 141 <u>The Cosmic Frontiers of General
Relativity</u>: <blockquote>
"In order to appreciate more fully the nature of the Kruskal-Szekeres
geometry, it is instructive to slice up the Kruskal-Szekeres diagram along
spacelike sheets.  These sheets will provide <i>embedding diagrams</i> of
the warping of space around a black hole.  This technique of slicing
space-time[sic] along spacelike hypersurfaces was employed earlier..."</blockquote>
Anyway, that's where I got the picture from.  The only thing that does not
make sense about the whole situation is the time involved.  An eternal
wormhole pinches off so quickly that not even light can get through.  This
would involved spacetime changing at or greater than the speed of light.
It's okay if it pinches off at the speed of light, but greater than...eh,
that's tricky and no one likes Faster-Than-Light particles.
<p>
<a name="sup8">8: page 197 of <u>The Cosmic Frontiers of General
Relativity</u>: <blockquote>
"Figure 12-8 is simply a coninuation of Figure 12-5 and is again based on
caclulations by C. T. Cunningham.  The important fact to notice from the
paths of these light rays is that near the center of the black hole they
are bent <i>away</i> from the singularity.  Although gravity far from the
center of a Kerr black hole is attractive and pulls things inward, near
the singularity gravity is repulsive and tries to push things
out!"</blockquote>
Yup, I am grateful to C. T. Cunningham for the easy-to-understand pictures
of various light rays hitting the singularity. I tried drawing embedding
diagrams by hand and realized that some things are best left to computer
drawing programs.
