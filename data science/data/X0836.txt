    first feature was the New Year's Gift being held later in January for the second year
    though it is usually held on January 1 at Morphettville. Today's racing provided a double
    for stallions Rubiton and Made Of Gold and both are now standing in Victoria after the
    latter relocated in 2001 while local jockey Jason Holder recorded a riding double.
    Graduates of the Magic Millions Adelaide sales came to the fore with 3 winners going
    through the ring in SA and a fourth entered but withdrawn before sale. The feature winner
    for the day Real Time has a half brother entered in this years Magic Millions sale by the
    first season Danzig stallion Anziyan, a full brother to Danehill.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Today was also South
    Australian Harness racings biggest night of the year with three Group 1 races. Many of
    Australia's top trotters and pacers attended to compete in the three Group 1 races - the
    2002 Trotters Cup, 2002 SA Pacers Derby and the 2002 Smoke Free Cup for the pacers. The
    appearance of champion pacer Shakamaker and champion trotter La Coocaracha drew a huge
    crowd including many thoroughbred and greyhound racing regulars and also younger fans of
    the harness racing such as cousins Renee and Renee. Neither disappointed as fans were
    given two awesome displays with a third Group 1 race, the Derby, in between featuring some
    of the country's most promising 3yos. For the harness pictorial go <a href="../globe120102/index.htm">here</a>.</font></td>
