<H3>WHAT IS THE TRUE VALUE OF AN AUTO RACING SPONSORSHIP DOLLAR?</H3>

<!--ICparagraph_text-->
<!--ICparagraph_text-->
<P>Corporate America’s advertising budgets are still bleeding in the wake of the across the board budget cuts since September 11th.  Corporate marketing managers attempt the challenging undertaking of getting maximum sales results from minimum advertising dollars.  Many are looking to the marketing phenomenon known as NASCAR auto racing for maximum exposure and finding the price tag daunting.<BR><BR>NASCAR, auto racing and the economy surrounding it is exploding.  It has become America’s sport, doing six (6) billion dollars in sponsorship dollars alone in a recent season (twice the combined total of the NFL, Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League).  Unfortunately, there are very few segments of NASCAR racing that have yet to reach their marketing potential.  Some would say that the marketing potential in auto racing has peaked.  Some declare that the average American race fan can no longer identify with the superstar NASCAR drivers and owners and the huge salaries that they receive coupled with the massive corporate entities that  they represent.  The end result of this situation is that advertising dollars are not producing desired results in the auto racing arena and most advertising budgets cannot justify the return on investment.<BR><BR>There is one segment of auto racing that has yet to be realized for it’s marketing power.  But that is on the verge of changing.  Auto racing pit crews have become the immediate future of auto racing sponsorship opportunities.  Marketing managers are realizing the hidden potential of the pit crews that have become so appealing to the American race fan.  The pit crews are the blue collar “working men” of racing and the racing public both idolizes them and relates to them.   This combination is a marketing miracle. They are the Pittsburgh Steelers of auto racing and they can influence your customers.<BR><BR>This is not a surprising trend to Cambria Laveck Padgett, Director of Member Services for the National Association of Pit Crew Members.  “This well deserved recognition of the racing pit crews has been growing for some time now as NASCAR‘s popularity has continued to soar.”  “It is not surprising that Corporate America  is realizing the marketing potential of these pit crews.”  “Pit crews are the hardest working competitors at the track each weekend but are still within reach of the fans.”  “Race fans both admire and relate to the crews and sponsors are beginning to notice.”  <BR><BR>The National Association of Pit Crew Members recognizes the efforts of auto racing pit crew and team members and their contributions to their field.  With members from all auto racing series across America from desert off-road endurance racing to the NASCAR Winston Cup garage the NAPCM provides Corporate America with tailored product marketing opportunities while avoiding the prohibitive price tags that racing teams can command.  <BR><BR>With the cost of a major auto racing sponsorship averaging between five and twenty million dollars the National Association of Pit Crew Members has a lot to offer potential sponsors.  Economically the NAPCM offers potential sponsors maximum return on advertising investment while still providing the exposure to the proven auto racing target market.<BR><BR>More information on sponsorship opportunities with the National Association of Pit Crew Members can obtained by contacting:<BR><BR>National Association of Pit Crew Members, Inc.<BR>Post Office Box 984<BR>Skyland, N.C.  28776<BR>(828) 242-0877</P>
