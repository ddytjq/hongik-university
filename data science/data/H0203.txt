<p><A Name="58"><B>Development and Application of
Subtractive Hybridization Strategies to
Facilitate Gene Discovery</b></a>
<p>Maria de Fatima Bonaldo, Greg Lennon and <B>Marcelo Bento Soares</B> 
<br>The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA
<br><a href="mailto:bento-soares@uiowa.edu">bento-soares@uiowa.edu</a>

<p>The methods we originally developed to normalize
directionally cloned cDNA libraries (Soares et al.,
1994; Bonaldo, Lennon &amp; Soares, 1996) have
been successfully utilized to generate a number of
human, mouse and rat cDNA libraries. All human
and mouse libraries (and soon the rat libraries as
well) have been contributed to the I.M.A.G.E.
consortium and they have been extensively used for
large scale generation of expressed sequence tags
(ESTs). Both the ESTs and their respective clones
are publicly available. Although the use of
normalized libraries has proven most advantageous
to minimize the redundant identification of the
mRNAs of the super-prevalent and intermediate
frequency classes within a particular tissue, it
cannot prevent the redundant identification of
mRNAs (of any frequency class) that are
expressed in multiple tissues. In other words,
normalization alone cannot avoid the redundant
identification of ESTs that have been obtained
previously from other libraries. This problem is
becoming increasingly more relevant as we
approach completion of the ongoing human and
mouse gene discovery efforts. Hence, we proposed
to take advantage of subtractive hybridization
strategies that we developed, to generate libraries
enriched for novel cDNAs. Briefly, pools of
I.M.A.G.E. clones from which ESTs have been
derived, are used as drivers in hybridizations with
single or multiple normalized libraries thus
generating subtracted libraries enriched for cDNAs
not yet represented in public databases. Subtracted
libraries are characterized by Southern
hybridization to assess reduction in representation
of clones of the driver population and then
contributed to the I.M.A.G.E. consortium for
large-scale arraying and sequencing. Sequence
analysis of two subtracted libraries that we have
generated indicated a four-fold reduction in
representation of the driver population. It is
anticipated that the use of subtracted libraries will
become increasingly advantageous as we strive
towards the ultimate goal of identifying all human
and mouse genes. This project has two major
goals: (1) to optimize the method for construction
of subtracted libraries, and (2) to generate
subtracted libraries to facilitate the ongoing human
and mouse EST programs.

<p>The general objectives of the European IMAGE
Consortium are: 

<ul>
  <li>To generate a minimal set of non
redundant cDNA clones for most human
gene transcripts and a master set of
unique full-length cDNA clones
representing 3,000 transcripts based upon
the IMAGE Consortium resources (arrays
of cDNA and CpG islands clones).</li>
  <li>To characterize by DNA sequencing with
high accuracy the complete sequence of
the master set of 3,000 human gene
transcripts (6 Mbases of finished
sequence).</li>
  <li>To obtain high resolution and comparative
functional mapping localization in man
and model organisms of 1,000 genes
represented in the master set.</li>
  <li>To develop the IMAGE Consortium Data
Base to provide an easy access to an
integrated view of the sequence, map and
expression data generated. </li>

</ul>

<p>The European IMAGE Consortium will devote
20% of the resources to the assembly of the
physical resources (cDNA and CpG island arrays
characterized by end sequencing and
fingerprinting, minimal sets of clones selected after
comprehensive sequence, clone and functional
clustering, master set of 3,000 full-length clones).
These resources will be available throughout the
European Union for the user community in both
academy and industry. The Consortium will serve
the future needs of the scientific community in the
systematic identification of all human genes and
their regulatory sequences by deciphering in an
efficient and economic manner 6 Mb of complete,
finished sequence for 3,000 transcripts of average
size 2 kb: 50% of the resources will be devoted to
the sequencing of full-length cDNAs and CpG
islands selected by Consortium on the basis of their
map position, similarity to known families or
expression profiles. In order to ensure that
advances in basic genetic knowledge is used to
further enhance human health, the Consortium will
seek to contribute to the identification of genes
involved in human biology and diseases by
correlating precise map location and phenotypic
expression data, exploiting various comparative
approaches for 1,000 of the genes represented in
the master set: 10% of the resources will be
devoted to high-resolution and comparative
functional mapping in close interaction with the
mapping consortia in order to obtain the most
precise and evolutionary relevant map location.
Last but not least, 20% of the resources will be
devoted to the IMAGE Consortium Data Base.
This will provide the community with up to date,
integrated sequence, mapping and expression data
related to the IMAGE consortium arrays, as they
are collected by IMAGE Consortium members in
Europe, the United States and Japan, and will help
in sharing and harmonizing such data.

<p>The Functional Genomics Initiative at the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory integrates outstanding
capabilities in mouse genetics, bioinformatics, and
instrumentation. The 50 year investment by the
DoE in mouse genetics/mutagenesis has created a
one-of-a-kind resource for generating mutations
and understanding their biological consequences. It
is generally accepted that, through the mouse as a
surrogate for human biology, we will come to
understand the function of human genes. In
addition to this world class program in mammalian
genetics, ORNL has also been a world leader in
developing bioinformatics tools for the analysis,
management and visualization of genomic data.
Combining this expertise with new instrumentation
technologies will provide a unique capability to
understand the consequences of mutations in the
mouse at both the organism and molecular levels.


<p>The goal of the Functional Genomics Initiative is
to develop the technology and methodology
necessary to understand gene function on a
genomic scale and apply these technologies to
megabase regions of the human genome. The effort
is scoped so as to create an effective and powerful
resource for functional genomics. ORNL is
partnering with the Joint Genome Institute and
other large scale sequencing centers to sequence
several multimegabase regions of both human and
mouse genomic DNA, to identify all the genes in
these regions, and to conduct fundamental surveys
to examine gene function at the molecular and
organism level. The Initiative is designed to be a
pilot for larger scale deployment in the
post-genome era. Technologies will be applied to
the examination of gene expression and regulation,
metabolism, gene networks, physiology and
development.


<p>The initiative was launched in 1996 and is
comprised of the following component efforts:


<p><B>Directed High-Efficiency Mouse Mutagenesis</b>
(Monica Justice) - We have established a
comprehensive high-efficiency mouse germline
mutagenesis program to examine mammalian gene
function. N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) is currently
the mutagen of choice because it induces point
mutations that reflect single gene function. Large
genomic regions can be scanned for mutations that
may reflect loss of function, gain of function, or
partial loss of function. In parallel, we are
developing sequence-ready BAC contigs of a
region that we are mutagenizing. Allelic series for
loci will be obtained that will complement other
mutagenesis approaches, such as gene disruptions.
Our program incorporates many different methods
of genetic screening to isolate mutations, and the
mutations will serve as a resource to the mouse
and human genome communities.


<p><B>The Mouse Screenotyping Center</B> (Dabney
Johnson) - We have established a mouse
phenotype-screening center to complement and
extend current mouse mutational analyses by
developing screening protocols for biochemical and
behavioral abnormalities. High-throughput
methodologies are being developed to efficiently
screen for induced aberrations in behaviors, in
locomotor and neuromuscular function, and in
biochemical and hematological parameters. The
screens are designed to detect mouse models of a
variety of human diseases from among large
populations of potentially mutant mice.


<p><B>Comprehensive Cellular Protein Analysis using
Microfluidic Devices</B> (Rose Ramsey) - ORNL's
unique lab-on-a-chip technology is being combined
with mass spectrometric methods to provide
uniquely powerful methods for comprehensive
cellular protein analysis using microfluidic devices.
The microchips will integrate on a single structure,
elements that enable multidimensional separations
of protein mixtures with electrospray ionization of
the analytes for direct, on-line interfacing with
mass spectrometry. This system will provide
unparalleled throughput and sensitivity, allowing
robust protein identification in small samples.


<p><B>Gene Expression Studies using Genosensor
Microchip Technology</B> (Ken Beattie) - Porous
glass flowthrough Genosensor chip technology
provides unique hybridization surface area and
sensitivity for use in large-scale gene expression
studies, mapping, and mutational surveillance. 


<p><B>Genome Lab-on-a-Chip</B> (Michael Ramsey) -
Microfluidic and microinstrumentation capabilities
are being applied to labor intensive assays used in
gene mapping and analysis of genetic mutations
and polymorphisms. "Laboratory-on-a-chip"
technology is being used to automate assay
procedures, increase analysis rates, eliminate the
use of radioactive isotopes, and reduce the
consumption of limited DNA samples. Current
efforts are focused on development of multiplexed
microdevices for PCR-based analysis of simple
tandem repeat markers used in the genetic and
physical mapping of the mouse genome.


<p><B>Mouse Physiological Monitoring Microchip</B>
(Nance Ericson) - Unique integrated circuitry is
being created to provide a capability for large scale
monitoring of mouse physiological parameters
related to physiological or behavioral abnormalities
due to mouse mutations. Application of this new
technology to genome studies will accelerate mass
specimen screening by providing automated
detailed observation and reporting of multiple key
physiological parameters, such as body
temperature, heart rate, physical activity level,
location and motion patterns using a microscale
implanted device.


<p><B>High-Throughput Tomographic Imaging of
Mouse Phenotypes</B> (Michael Paulus) - A new
high-resolution high-throughput automated 3D
mouse imaging and screening methodology is being
created which will rapidly identify, quantify and
record subtle phenotypes in mutagenized mice,
based on a novel x-ray imaging technology with 50
micron spatial resolution and a 3D dataset
acquisition time of &lt;1 minute per mouse.


<p><B>Development of DNA Sequencing and
Automated Genotyping Infrastructure</B> (Richard
Mural) Basic capabilities for DNA sequencing and
automated genotyping are being developed to
support mouse genetics and molecular biology. Not
only are these capabilities necessary for addressing
basic problems in genetic and molecular biology
but they will also and flexibility to the program for
initiating new projects. Having the DNA sequence
of regions which are being mutagenized will also
be important to mutation detection.


<p><B>Event-Based Flexible Automated DNA
Sequencing</B> (Reid Kress) - By moving automated
DNA sequencing from a sequential, batch-mode
process to a continuous mode hands off process we
will be able to maximize the efficiency and
cost-effectiveness of our limited DNA sequencing
resources at ORNL. 

<p><B>Bioinformatics Support for Gene Function</B> (Ed
Uberbacher) - A comprehensive system to collect
and assemble information relevant to the function
of newly discovered genes is being constructed for
application to sequenced human and mouse regions
in the Functional Genomics Initiative. This
includes support for initial gene finding and
informatics-based characterization, and
compilation of experimental information generated
related to mouse mutations, gene and protein
expression studies, and computational and
experimental information derived from numerous
external databases and other model organisms. The
resulting catalog of gene function information will
be linked to genome-wide browsing being produced
by the Genome Annotation Consortium. 


<p><B>Direct Visualization of Regulatory Protein-DNA
complexes and Mutations using AFM</B> (David
Allison) - High-throughput atomic force
microscopy will be used to precisely locate and
visualize proteins bound to individual DNA
molecules or genes, including complexes related to
regulation of gene expression and repair enzymes
site-specifically bound to lesion sites. Automated
image analysis and interpretation systems are being
applied to locate and characterize the protein-DNA
complexes.


<p><B>Mass Spectrometry for DNA Analysis</B> (Michelle
Buchanan) - To complement the genome-wide
mutation screening efforts, we are examining
parameters in mass spectroscopy-based DNA
analysis. Our initial efforts have focused on optical
imaging and diagnostics of the matrix assisted
laser desorption ionization (MALDI) plume, and
investigations of the crystallization of DNA for the
MALDI matrix. In parallel, we are examining
methods for higher-throughput DNA analysis
necessary for large-scale genome-wide
polymorphism analysis.

<p>The human XPF gene is required for the cellular
response to DNA damage caused by ultraviolet
radiation and mutagenic chemicals. Mutation in
this gene leads to one form of the disease syndrome
xeroderma pigmentosum. Homologs of the XPF
protein are present in fly, worm, plant, yeast and
archea, indicating conservation of an essential
function throughout all of evolution. The
expression of mouse XPF in pachytene
spermatocytes corroborates other indications that
XPF has an additional role in genetic
recombination during meiosis. Information from all
of the homologs has been valuable in directing
experiments to determine the specific
characteristics of the XPF protein. We have
demonstrated the predicted endonuclease activity,
protein-protein interactions, and DNA binding in
the recombinant XPF protein that was
overexpressed and purified from <I>E. coli</I>.
Fragments of XPF obtained during purification
retain endonuclease activity. This result, together
with the sequence analysis of homologous proteins,
has lead us to produce a series of deletion
fragments of XPF in order to identify functional
domains. The use of comparative genomics
coupled with protein chemistry has thus enabled us
to begin defining the function of this protein that is
crucial to human health.

<p>Recently we demonstrated that transformation-
associated recombination (TAR) in the yeast
<I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I> can be used to
selectively isolate single copy genes, BRCA2 and
BRCA1, from total human DNA as large circular
YACs<sup> (1)</sup>. The TAR cloning method is based on
co-penetration into yeast spheroplasts of gently
isolated genomic DNA along with the vector DNA
that contains 5' and 3' sequences specific for gene
of interest, followed by recombination between the
vector and the human DNA to establish a YAC <sup>(2)</sup>.
We investigated whether a single copy gene could
be isolated directly from total human DNA by
TAR cloning using only one piece of its sequence
information. A TAR cloning vector was
constructed that contained a small amount of 3'
HPRT sequence and an Alu repeat.
Transformation with the vector along with human
DNA led to the selective isolation of large circular
YACs containing the entire HPRT gene. YACs up
to 400 kb were generated that extended from the
unique position of 3' HPRT to various Alu's
similar to "genome walking". Based on
transfection of the NeoR-retrofitted YAC clones
into mouse cells, the YACs contained the
functional HPRT. Use of the common Alu repeat
as a second targeting sequence greatly expends
utility of TAR cloning. We propose that a new
TAR cloning approach is readily applicable to
direct isolation of single copy genes from
mammalian genomes.

<p>During the last two years or so, our
DOE-sponsored research led to the discovery and
characterization of DNA targets for retroposon
integration (1,2). These targets are most likely
recognized and cut by L1-ORF2 enzymes already
existing in mammalian cells and have been
postulated to be hot spots for homologous
recombination (3). Recently, our team in
collaboration with Dr. Sun-Yu Ng, has
demonstrated that the preferred integration targets
are also hot spots for homologous recombination
which is increased by up to two orders of
magnitude in test cancer cell lines (4). In another
collaborative effort, we have discovered that
mobile elements integrate primarily at kinkable
DNA sites (5).

of new repetitive families (7,8).

<p>Construction of large-insert libraries in bacterial
hosts, such as those using PAC/BAC vectors and
DH10B cells, has been limited by the inefficient
transformation of <I>Escherichia coli</I> with large
DNA molecules by electroporation. The goal of
this project was to elucidate the mechanism and
kinetics of the entrance of large DNA molecules
into DH10B cells on exposure to electric fields and
to exploit this information to increase the
efficiency of PAC/BAC library construction. The
essence of the approach used is the independent
optimization of the three distinct stages of
electrotransformation (ET): i) electrophoretic
movement of DNA towards cells in cell-DNA
suspension, ii) permeabilization of cell wall
(production of electric pores) and iii)
electrophoretic permeation of DNA molecules into
the cells through electric pores. This was feasible
due to the apparatus constructed in Saint
Petersburg State Technical University that can
generate multiple independently-regulated electric
pulses. The results obtained previously with
different <I>Escherichia coli</I> strains, other than
DH10B, have revealed that the optimal time of
electrophoretic permeation of DNA molecules into
the cells through electric pores is proportional to
the square root of the molecular length of
supercoiled plasmids in the range from 7 up to 250
kb. This explains the failure of previous large
DNA ET work that had been based on results with
smaller DNA. To more fully characterize the ET
process of DH10B cells with large DNA, we have
determined the effects of each of the electric field
parameters on transformation with respect to
plasmid size (and topology). Plasmids ranging in
size up to 250 kb have been used, and the resulting
transformed molecules have been examined to
verify their fidelity. The data which will be
presented shall show that kinetics of DNA
penetration into DH10B cells on exposure of
electric field differ drastically from those obtained
for other used <I>E. coli</I> cells (C600, HB101, K802,
DH5a). First of all no clear dependence on
molecule size of supercoiled plasmids was
observed. The preliminary interpretation of the
results is: the size of appearing electropores in
DH10B is much bigger than that in other <I>E. coli</I>
cells. It explains high ET efficiency of DH10B
cells with large supercoiled plasmids which can be
achieved (up to 108 transformants per mg of 250
kb plasmid) and which is, on a molar basis, only
several times lower than the highest ET efficiency
with small pUC18 plasmid.

<p>Because of the advantages of large insert size and
stability associated with BAC cloning systems, we
have attempted to adapt the pBelloBAC vector for
use with flow sorted human chromosomes.
Compared to making genomic libraries (where
DNA mass is not limited) the cloning of
chromosomes into the BAC vector is very
challenging due to the fact that only microgram
quantities of DNA can be obtained even after
extensive periods of sorting (months). The
technical challenges involved in making
chromosome-specific BAC libraries include
developing methodologies to 1) allow efficient
recovery of flow sorted chromosomes into agarose
plugs; 2) predictable partial digestion of small
masses of chromosomal DNA embedded in
agarose; and 3) improving BAC cloning
efficiencies to allow construction of multiple
representation libraries from microgram quantities
of chromosomal DNA. 


<p>We have found that partial digestions using
HindIII can be performed in a predictable and
reliable manner on microgram quantities of
genomic DNA by carefully controlling incubation
time and enzyme concentration-to-DNA mass
ratios. In addition, these small amounts of partially
digested genomic DNA can be size selected using
PFG electrophoresis and cloned into the BAC
vector with efficiencies that are sufficient for
producing multiple representation chromosome
libraries (103-104 cfu per mg starting DNA;
average insert size approximately 90 kb).


<p>Improvements have also been made in the
collection of flow sorted chromosomes prior to
DNA isolation. The previously used method for
collecting chromosomes involved sorting into an
agarose-coated tube until the tube was full of
sheath fluid and then harvesting the relatively small
number of chromosomes by centrifugation. We
have developed a new method that allows larger
numbers of chromosomes to be sorted into a single
agarose coated tube. This is accomplished by using
a series of centrifugation, decanting, and re-sorting
steps to 'stack' chromosome pellets within the
tube. A final spin followed by brief melting and
regelling of the agarose is used to embed the
chromosomes within the agarose plug. Higher
DNA yields have resulted from using the stacked
pellet method. However, chromosomes were lost
during this process because the yield of
chromosomal DNA was not directly proportional
to the number of chromosomes that were originally
sorted. This loss of chromosomes during the
embedding step represents the single major
problem that remains to be solved in order to allow
the production of chromosome-specific BAC
libraries. This work was supported by the US
DOE under contract W-7405-ENG-36.

<p>Transformation-associated recombination (TAR)
was exploited in yeast to the selective isolation of
human DNAs as circular YACs from
monochromosomal mouse/human hybrid cell lines.
Chromosome 5 and 16 specific YAC libraries were
produced from the hybrid cell lines Q826-20 and
CY18, respectively, using the F-factor based TAR
vectors containing human Alu repeats. The
presence of an F-factor origin in the TAR vectors
provides the opportunity for transfer of generated
YACs to <I>E. coli</I> to produce BACs. Although &lt;2%
of the DNA in the hybrid cells was human as many
as 80% of the transformants had human DNA
YACs based on colony hybridization of a
representative number of clones with both human
and mouse probes. Thus, the level of enrichment of
human DNA to mouse was nearly 3,000-fold. The
YAC libraries of chromosome 5 and 16 consist of
299 and 1320 clones, respectively, with an average
size of 150 kb. Approximately 266 chromosome 5
and 748 chromosome 16 specific BACs were
obtained after electroporation of YACs into <I>E.
coli</I>. Based on the size of the clones generated from
chromosome 5, the YAC and BAC libraries are
~0.24X and ~0.21X, respectively, in chromosomal
coverage. Based on the size of the clones generated
from chromosome 16, the YAC and BAC libraries
are ~2.4X and ~1.2X, respectively, in
chromosomal coverage. The chromosomal
distribution of 41 TAR BACs each from
chromosomes 5 and 16 was evaluated by
fluorescence in situ hybridization. The distribution
of FISH signals was random along the length of
each chromosome. We concluded that TAR
cloning may provide an efficient means for
generating YAC/BACs from specific
chromosomes.

<p>The goal of the human genome project is to
characterize and sequence entire genomes of
human and several model organisms, thus
providing complete sets of information on the
entire structure of transcribed, regulatory and other
functional regions for these organisms. In the past
years, a number of useful genetic and physical
markers on human and mouse genomes have been
made available along with the advent of BAC
library resources for these organisms. The
advances in technology and resource development
made it feasible to efficiently construct
genome-wide physical BAC contigs for human and
other genomes. Currently, over 30,000 mapped
STSs and 27,000 mapped Unigenes are available
for human genome mapping. ESTs and cDNAs are
excellent resources for building contig maps for
two reasons. Firstly, they exist in two alternative
forms - as both sequence information for PCR
primer pairs, and cDNA clones - thus making
library screening by colony hybridization as well
as pooled library PCR possible. We are now able
to screen genomic libraries efficiently for large
number of DNA probes by combining over 100
cDNA probes in each hybridization. Second, the
linkage and order of genes are rather conserved
among human, mouse and other model organisms.
Therefore, gene markers have advantages over
random anonymous STSs in building maps for
comparative genomic studies. 


<p>As a preliminary work for the ongoing
"BAC-EST" project, we are currently screening
our human BAC libraries with thousands of cDNA
probes. We have thus far used over 3,000 Unigene
probes and the number will increase to 7,000 in
this year. Our goal is to screen the library with at
least 27,000 markers, most of which are in the
form of cDNA probes. This represents at least 1
marker per every 100 kb of euchromatin regions.
We plan to deconvolute the positive BACs to each
marker by sorting the library into groups of BACs
that are positive to specific pools, arraying each
group on small hybridization filters, then
hybridizing the filters with individual probes. We
are also determining the end sequences for the
positive BACs. BAC end sequence (BES)
information can be extremely useful to precisely
align these mapped BAC clones against any known
sequence contigs by means of sequence match.
Putative contigs or clone overlaps identified by
markers or sequence match are verified via
restriction fingerprint analysis. The BAC clone
resources integrated with physical mapping
information will be useful for building
sequence-ready contigs on any chromosomal
region.

<p>We have previously reported on the construction of
an integrated physical map of human chromosome
16 (Doggett et al., Nature 377:Suppl:335-365,
1995). This map was constructed against a
framework somatic cell hybrid breakpoint map
which divides the chromosome into 90 intervals.
The physical map consists of both a low resolution
YAC contig map and a high resolution
cosmid/P1/BAC contig map. The low resolution
YAC contig map is now comprised of 900 CEPH
megaYACs, and 300 flow-sorted 16-specific
miniYACs that are localized to and ordered within
the breakpoint intervals with 1150 STSs. (These
include 200 megaYACs and 300 STSs which were
incorporated from the Whitehead Institute's total
genome mapping effort.) The YAC/STS map
provides practically complete coverage of the
euchromatic arms of the chromosome and provides
STS markers on average every 78 kb. The
integrated map also includes 470
genes/ESTs/exons and 400 genetic markers--as
part of an ongoing effort to incorporate all
available loci into a single map of this
chromosome. A high resolution 'sequence ready'
cosmid contig map consisting of 4000
fingerprinted cosmids assembled into contigs
covering 60% of the chromosome is anchored to
the YAC and cytogenetic breakpoint maps via
STSs developed from cosmid contigs and by
hybridizations between YACs and cosmids.
Current work is focused on completing the
'sequence ready' map using a combination of
cosmids and BACs. IRS-bubble PCR products
from a minimally tiling set of YACs are being
hybridized to the chromosome 16 cosmid library to
localize cosmids to gaps in the existing map; and
over 200 BACs, identified by library screening are
now linked to the cosmid map. Several large
contigs have been completed across disease gene
regions in collaboration with several other
investigators by supplying the available map
resources (YACs, STSs, and cosmid contigs) and
high density cosmid filter arrays for cosmid
walking and YAC to cosmid hybridization
experiments. The largest of these is a 4 Mb
restriction mapped 'sequence ready' cosmid contig
extending proximally from the p telomere. A 3.0
Mb region of this contig, extending proximally
from the PKD1 locus is the substrate for a finished
sequencing effort underway at Los Alamos.

<p>Extensive physical mapping efforts and advances
in automated sequencing technology have resulted
in the initiation of genomic sequencing of large
human chromosomal regions. Currently, both NIH
and DOE are supporting several centers in the U.S.
to begin sequencing the genomes of human and
model organisms systematically and in massive
scale. In the past 1.5 years, Caltech has been
building physical contig maps on the 20 Mbp
region of the human chromosome 16p arm
(16p13.1-11.2) jointly with TIGR and LANL as a
pilot experiment to generate sequence-ready
physical map using large insert human BAC
libraries (A, B and C) that have been constructed
at Caltech. 


<p>First, the pooled library A (with 3.5 X genomic
coverage) was screened with 98 ordered STS
primer pairs taken from the integrated chromosome
16 YAC-STS map constructed by LANL. In this
initial screening, 77 STS markers successfully
identified 184 positive BACs. Positive BACs were
characterized by checking multiple single colonies
per clone, and restriction fingerprint analysis. For
the clones to be sequenced, FISH mapping and
genomic Southern hybridization steps were added
for the verification of the chromosomal localization
and genomic colinearity. Inserts from these
positive BACs were used for screening library B
and C (approximately 10X genomic coverage) by
colony hybridization. The libraries were also
screened with approximately 90 Unigene cDNA
probes that have been localized to the 20 Mb
region, and with approximately 250 Unigene
cDNA probes mapped to the other regions on
chromosome 16. Shotgun clones derived from the
ends of completely sequenced BACs were used as
probes to efficiently identify BACs that overlap
minimally with the sequenced BACs. We have thus
far identified nearly 1,000 putative BACs
belonging to the 20 Mb region, and more than
2,000 BACs over the entire chromosome 16. End
sequences were determined from all of these
BACs. The BES (BAC end sequence) have been
used to align these clones against the sequenced
BACs by sequence match, thus allowing rapid and
precise determination of the extent of overlaps
between clones. The putative overlaps from the
sequence match are verified by restriction
fingerprint analysis.


<p>Currently we are building BacDB database, a
modified version of ACeDB.4_1, by entering and
organizing all information related to human BAC
clones and physical mapping data that are
available from Caltech, LANL, TIGR, as well as
public resources. The database contains available
BAC related data and mapping information, STSs,
ESTs, BES, and completed BAC sequences.
BacDB will not only serve as an integrated
database for mapping and sequencing, but will be a
tool for the efficient identification of
sequence-ready clones.

<p>Libraries constructed in BAC vectors have become
the choice for clone sets in high throughput
genomic sequencing projects because of their
higher stability as compared to their YAC or
cosmid counterparts. We have proposed the use of
BAC end sequences as a primary means of
selecting minimally overlapping clones for
sequencing large genomic regions. A necessary
prerequisite of this is the collection of end
sequences from all the clones in deep coverage
BAC libraries. This is now being pursued for both
the human and <I>Arabidopsis</I> genomes. BAC vectors
are based on the <I>E. coli</I> F-factor replicon and offer
strict copy number control limiting the number of
BACs to 1-2 copies per cell. However, in addition
to minimizing the chances of chromosomal
rearrangements, the low copy number also poses a
challenge for high throughput direct sequencing of
the BAC clone ends because of the difficulty in
obtaining sufficient quantities of high quality
template from standard minipreps.


<p>We have developed reliable approaches for both a
multiprep for BAC DNA purification and a
protocol for the direct sequencing of BAC DNA
using Dye Terminator chemistry. The combination
of these two methods allows us to produce daily
about 400 high quality BAC end sequences with an
average edited length of 400 bases using 4 ABD
377 sequencers and a small team of personnel. To
aid in sample tracking and high throughput
processing, the prep is processed completely in a
96 well format, from clone storage and growth
through DNA purification, isopropanol
precipitation, and final resuspension. Sequencing
reactions are also processed in a 96 well format,
including the removal of excess dyes before
loading onto the sequencers. Both high throughput
methods are amenable to future automation. Our
methods will be presented along with discussion
regarding the advantages and disadvantages of
various methods we tried.

<p>The STC approach has been proposed as an
attractive strategy to provide a sequence ready
scaffolding for the efficient and directed
sequencing of the complete human genome <sup>(1)</sup>. This
effort has been undertaken through a collaborative
effort between the California Institute of
technology, TIGR and the University of
Washington, and funded through the U. S.
Department of Energy.  The approach entails the
sequencing of the ends of 300,000 Bacterial
Artificial Chromosomes (BACs) that constitute a
20X deep Human DNA library to construct a
sequence ready scaffold of the human genome.


<p>At the Univ. of Washington we have assembled a
high throughput automated end sequencing and
fingerprinting process with its associated
informatics. BAC clones are robotically inoculated
from 384 well plates into 4 ml 96 well culture
format, grown and the BAC DNA robotically
extracted using AutoGen 740 robots.  BAC
template DNA from the AutoGen is then
robotically transferred into 96 well microtiter
plates from which DNA sequencing and
fingerprinting reactions are setup.  DNA
fingerprinting is performed using conventional
agarose electrophoresis, digestion with a single
restriction enzyme (EcoRV) followed by
automated imaging and analysis.  DNA sequencing
is performed using PE-ABD High Sensitivity dye
primers and ABI 377 DNA sequencers. 
Laboratory protocols, automated data production, 
data processing,  quality control measures and
LIMS will be described in detail.  During a 50 day
period the STC laboratory sequenced 23317 BAC
ends (STCs).  19224  (82.4%)  where greater than
100 bp non trimmed and the average nontrimmed
read length was 388 bp for a total of 7.46 Mb
(.25%) of the genome.  29 % of the STCs
contained repetitive DNA but less than 11% where
entirely repeat.  12% of the repetitive DNA were
LINE sequence, 4.6% LTR, 6.7% SINE sequence
and 1.3% of the STCs contain a microsatellite or
simple sequence repeat.  The total G + C content
was 40% and the average CpG content was .28, 
both expected numbers for human genomic DNA. 
224 STCs had CpG scores of 1 representing CpG
islands.  3103 STCs (16.8%) hit the EST,
non-redundant nucleotide or Sixframe database.
1103 STCs hit the EST database (DB), 517  of
which hit only the EST; 1087 STCs hit the nr
nucleotide DB, 471 of which hit the nr nucleotide
DB only, and 913 STCs hit the nr protein DB, 500
of which hit only the nr protein DB.  181 STCs
(1%) hit all three databases, 131 hit nr nuc. and nr
protein DBs, 101 hit the EST and nr prot. DBs,
and 304 hit EST and nr nucleotide DBs, i.e.,  4%
hit more than one of these DBs and probably
represent genes.

<p>PCR-based methods have provided invaluable
tools for the analysis of large genomic clones, such
as YACs and BACs, that comprise the bulk of
most existing and emerging genomic physical
maps.  However, applications of the available
methods are often limited, or made more difficult
to apply, because of the need for significant
identity between primers and sequences located on
both sides of a targeted site.  We have developed a
method that permits target sequences to be
exponentially amplified, with a high degree of
purity and specificity, from low-complexity
templates when only a single sequence-specific
anchor primer is present in the mixture. 
Amplification is efficiently driven by specific
binding of the primer to one end of the target locus,
with reverse priming initiated at nearby regions
containing only a 5-6 bp sequence match with the
anchor oligonucleotide.  Using standard
vector-derived primers, we have applied the
single-primer protocol to amplify end-fragments
directly from a number of different
BAC-containing colonies, and have generated high
quality DNA sequence information from the PCR
mixtures without the need for further purification. 
This work introduces single-primer PCR as a
simple, efficient and convenient alternative to
existing methods for isolation of sequence-ready
end fragments and other sequences from within
BACs and other large-insert genomic clones.

<p>One of the JGI genomic sequencing targets is the
distal 45 Mb of the long arm of human
chromosome 5. This region was chosen because it
contains a cluster of cytokine growth factor (IL3,
IL4, IL5, IL9, IL12, IL13, GM-CSF, FGFA,
M-CSF) and receptor genes (GRL, ADRB2,
M-CSFR, PDGFR) and is likely to yield new and
functionally related genes through long range
sequence analysis. This region is relatively rich in
disease-associated genes including susceptibility to
asthma, several autosomal dominant corneal
dystrophies, low-frequency hearing loss, dominant
limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, Treacher Collins
syndrome, and myeloid disorders associated with
the 5q- syndrome.


<p>The mapping strategy is based on a combination of
both hybridization and PCR approaches. Inter-Alu
fragments generated from non-chimeric YACs
covering 3-5 Mb of DNA were used to isolate
regionally specific P1/PAC/BAC clones. These
clones were sized by pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis, and their map locations were
confirmed using fluorescent in situ hybridization.
We estimated that approximately 60% of the
clones representing a targeted region in the P1,
PAC or BAC libraries were identified by this
approach. Overlaps between P1s, PACs and BACs
were mainly established by PCR using STSs
generated from ends of clones. Contigs were
further oriented using STSs developed from known
genes, ordered markers, and ends of P1s, PACs,
BACs and YACs. The STS content mapping also
allowed us to identify new clones to fill gaps. 


<p>We have used this strategy to map 198 P1s, 60
PACs and 1,407 BACs so far in the region of
5q23-q35. These clones were linked by 1,321
STSs to form 74 contigs. The contigs are
approximately 0.2-4 Mb in size. The average
density of STSs is about 3.7 per 100 Kb in the
proximal 20 Mb and about 2.3 per 100 Kb in the
distal 25 Mb. Most STSs were derived from the
ends of BACs which allowed detection of 3.4%
chimeras by PCR analysis. The clone coverage of
the proximal 20 Mb is over 95% and the coverage
of the distal 25 Mb is between 70-80% at different
locations. To date, 121 P1/PAC/BAC clones
spanning the proximal 10 Mb were in the pipeline
for production sequencing. This clone map with
STS information is distributed through our Web
site (<I><a

<p>We have developed an integrated genetic and
physical map for human chromosome 19
consisting of metrically ordered, well-annotated
cosmid/BAC contigs that provide a critical
resource for sequencing. 


<p>At approximately 65 Mb, chromosome 19
represents 2% of the haploid genome; it is the most
GC-rich human chromosome, suggesting an
especially high gene density. The current map
consists of 185 ordered cosmid/BAC contigs of
average size 225 kb (range 40 kb to 3.3 Mb)
spanning a total of 42 Mb, i.e. over 75% of the
non-centromeric portion of chromosome 19. An
additional 8 Mb of small EcoRI mapped cosmid
contigs, average size 80 kb, have not yet been
incorporated into the ordered map. The order of the
constituent contigs have been determined by
standard FISH techniques applied to a series of
chromatin targets with increasing resolution.
High-resolution FISH to decondensed human
sperm pronuclei establishes genomic distances
between 286 ordered FISH markers in 19p and q,
thereby providing a "metric" framework that links
the ordered contigs to the cytogenetic map.
Complete digest EcoRI maps have been
constructed for all contigs, which provide
validation of the contig assembly and constituent
clones, as well as an indication of contig size and
extent of clone overlap.


<p>The map currently includes 15 Mb of restriction
mapped contigs greater than 500 kb (average size
1 Mb), which provide ideal substrates for
large-scale genomic sequencing of this
chromosome. About 7.5 Mb have been sequenced
or are currently in the sequencing pipeline. The
high depth of coverage (average 5X) and mix of
cosmid and BAC clones enables selection of an
optimum set of spanning clones with minimum
overlap for sequencing. 


<p>The map is extensively annotated, with over 300
genes/cDNAs and 180 polymorphic markers that
have been localized at the clone, and occasionally
restriction fragment, level. Placement of the genetic
markers in the physical map demonstrates excellent
correspondence with existing genetic maps and
provides relative order of many markers that
cannot be distinguished by recombination. This
map provides a unique resource for identification
of disease genes mapped to this chromosome.

<p>The framework genome-wide physical maps have
largely been constructed with YAC clones. YACs
however, are often unstable and chimeric, and
because of the difficulty to isolate cloned YAC
DNA in a pure form, are unsuitable for DNA
sequencing. Therefore, BAC libraries, which retain
the advantages of large insert size, are stable, and
easy to manipulate, were constructed. Physical
mapping with these libraries is now underway and
is a critical component to large scale genomic
sequencing.


<p>Clone based physical maps have been constructed
by many methods, including clone fingerprinting
and STS content mapping. We are developing an
alternative method which is applicable to small to
moderate complexity clone libraries such as
chromosome specific cosmid and BAC libraries
and plasmid subclone libraries of BACs. This
two-dimensional hybridization method is based on
clone hybridization with pooled clone DNA as
probes. The principal experimental design is as
follows: First, several grids of the library are
made. Second, DNA of the clones are pooled by a
two-dimensional strategy (rows and columns) and
purified by subtractive hybridization to remove
both low abundance and high abundance repetitive
elements. Third, the grids are hybridized separately
with the row and column pooled DNAs. Positive
hybridizing clones that are in common between the
row and column pool probes will overlap with the
clone that is in the intersection point with these
pools. We are using the program MAP (written by
Mark Mundt) to construct contigs from the
two-dimensional hybridization results. 


<p>This method was tested with 350 cosmids, chosen
from the chromosome 16 specific cosmid library
by grid hybridization with 3 YACs. Overlaps
identified by two-dimensional hybridization were
confirmed by restriction fingerprinting. We are
currently implementing this approach for rapid
construction of contigs from a chromosome 16
specific BAC library and for the ordering of
plasmid subclones of cosmids and BACs into
minimal tiling sets prior to their sequencing.

<p>ISCN 1995 established a new set of Human
chromosome ideograms that comprise 850
metaphase-chromosome bands, differentiated by
five shades of staining intensity [ISCN (1995),
Mitelman, F. (ed), S. Karger, Basel; and Francke,
U. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 65 206-219 (1994)].
The five band shades are referred to as white, light
gray, medium gray, dark gray, and black. These
shades, presumably, reflect different underlying
states of chromatin. The publication of the
mapping of 16,000 partially sequenced genes, or
cDNAs, to a framework radiation hybrid map of
the Human genome has established the
chromosome assignment for as much as 20% of all
Human genes [Schuler et al., Science 274 540-546
(1996)]. In this work, the genes were observed to
be distributed non-uniformly along the
chromosomes. Because none of these cDNAs were
localized to a specific chromosome band, no
conclusions were drawn about gene densities in the
different types of bands.


<p>To establish a relationship between gene density
and band type we have used the proportion of each
type of band on each chromosome to estimate the
respective gene densities, by optimizing the
consistency of the model with the numbers of
cDNAs on the 22 autosomes. In detail, the
theoretical prediction for the number of genes on
chromosome number j equals &acirc;5=1 aipij, in which
the ai are gene density parameters for band type I
and the pij are the proportions for the five types of
bands on this chromosome. The statistical analysis
used involves integrating over the posterior joint
distribution for the parameters, given the linear
model and the cDNA data. In one data-analysis we
grouped the white and light gray bands together,
assigning them a shared gene-density, and also
grouped the two darkest bands together, thereby
reducing the number of gene-density parameters to
three. The inferred gene density for the white &amp;
light gray bands equaled 7.3/Mb, with a standard
deviation of 0.3, the inferred gene density in gray
bands equaled 1.45/Mb, with a standard deviation
of 1.1, and the inferred gene density in gene density
in dark gray and black bands equaled 0.45/Mb,
with a standard deviation of 0.4. If we knew the
total number, T, of genes in the Human genome,
the expected gene densities are, of course, our
estimates multiplied by T/16,000. Reasonable
choices for T range from 60,000 to 100,000. We
will present the gene density estimates for all types
of bands, plus confidence intervals. 


<p>It is reasonable to conclude that the expected gene
density decreases with band darkness. These
results have practical implications for large scale
sequencing of the Human genome and have
ramifications for the study of the evolution of
genomes.

<p>As sequencing of the human genome progresses,
the role of the mouse as proxy mammal for
functional studies will become crucial. We at
ORNL have designed a comprehensive program
that will combine the power of our unparalleled
mouse 'mutation machine' with our massive
computational capability in bioinformatics and our
integrated technology development effort in
detection and analysis of new mutant mouse
phenotypes. Our goal is to assign function to all
the genes that reside in defined segments of the
mouse genome, via efficient identification of
phenotypic changes in behavior, biochemistry, and
gene expression that accompany induced genetic
changes. 


<p>The creation of functional maps of the mammalian
genome must keep pace with the rapidly expanding
physical and transcriptional maps. High-efficiency
mutagenesis in mouse spermatogonial stem cells,
using the supermutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea
(ENU) to induce point mutations in single genes,
will provide the functional information for given
segments of DNA sequence within the physical
map. Other mutagens, for made-to-order
mutagenesis, are also being tested, as are
DNA-repair deficient mouse strains as mutagenesis
targets. For an immediate target, we propose to
'saturate' a long and well-characterized
chromosomal deletion with ENU-induced
mutations to develop a gene-by-gene phenotype
map of the region uncovered by the deletion. This
efficient experimental protocol will generate
phenotypes evident in deletion hemizygotes after
only the second generation post-treatment, and all
progeny in that generation will be 'color-coded' for
instant genotyping. Submapping of phenotypes will
be quite efficient because we have existing mutant
stocks that carry many additional deletions whose
endpoints nest within the large deletion. Physical
and transcriptional mapping within this set of
nested deletions are well under way.


<p>We will also create similar deletion reagents in the
mouse cognate for a human chromosomal region
already being sequenced; good choices would be
mouse chr 16/human chr 21, or mouse chr 8/
human chrs 16 and 19. A complex of nested
deletions will be generated molecularly using the
Cre/loxP approach, or via radiation-induced
mutations in ES cells.


<p>Pilot experiments conducted here at ORNL
demonstrated that high-efficiency ENU
mutagenesis generated numerous visible and lethal
mutations that fall within a large deletion
encompassing the p locus in mouse chr 7. These
experiments resulted in the isolation and fine
localization of at least seven new loci in 1244
gametes tested; since only lethal and visible
phenotypes were under scrutiny, more subtle
mutations/alterations were missed. We propose to
extend this analysis to a second p-region deletion,
p30PUb, that has been shown to contain multiple
interesting phenotypes. These phenotypes have
been submapped to specific intervals between
deletion breakpoints, but we now must create the
necessary intragenic mutant alleles for any genes in
the deletion. We expect also to generate new
phenotypes as we disable additional genes within
the large deletion. DNA sequence of the deleted
region will be determined in conjunction with the
JGI to facilitate gene identification and mutational
analysis.


<p>Additional crucial components of our strategy are
automation of phenotype screening by
microfabrication of subdermal sensors,
computer-aided imaging of both skeletal and soft
tissues, and improvements in through-put for
behavior-testing paradigms and GC/MS analysis
of blood, urine, and breath for biochemical
alterations. Changes in gene expression will be
detected by the use of chip-based DNA/RNA
analysis, and mass-spectrometry-based protein
analysis from mutant vs normal cell populations.


<p>We are also developing sperm-freezing protocols
for mutation preservation and distribution, and
efficient artificial insemination for recovery.

<p>The mouse, with its powerful genetic tools and its
extensive comparative molecular linkage map with
the human, is a useful model organism to study
mammalian gene function. Multiple mutant alleles
of genes can be derived by mutagenesis that may
reflect loss of function, partial loss of function, or
gain of function. The entire series of alleles must
be studied together to dissect the function of the
gene. 


<p> Overlapping deletions obtained at albino (c) are
useful genetic reagents for functional genomics.
Saturation mutagenesis with ethylnitrosourea
(ENU) utilizing the deletions at the c region on
mouse Chromosome 7 revealed many new
functional units that reflect single gene changes
(Rinchik et al. 1990; Rinchik et al. 1995). The
region is homologous to human Chromosome
11q13-q21, and is linked to the mouse homologue
of human oculocutaneous albinism, type 1A.
Because of the nature of the phenotypic screen,
many of the new mutants die as embryos. The
region is particularly valuable for functional
studies because of the variety of genetic reagents,
including overlapping deletions and point
mutations, that are available. Our focus is a group
of alleles isolated at a locus (axis) that affects the
development of the body axis. The homozygous
phenotypes of six alleles at axis that are likely to
be point mutations range from early prenatal
lethality to adult viability. The baseline function of
axis is demonstrated by two alleles that arrest
during formation of the primitive streak. However,
two other alleles have a severely disorganized body
axis later in development. One allele exhibits a
variety of neural tube defects, including
exencephaly. Together, these observations suggest
that the axis locus functions in the formation of the
rostral-caudal body axis and neurulation.
Intriguingly, homozygotes of one allele of axis
survive to adulthood, and have axial skeletal
abnormalities. Complete complementation studies
of these six alleles reveal complex genetic
characteristics such as intragenic complementation
among two of the lethal alleles and a maternal
effect of the viable allele. The maternal effect is a
phenotype of severe neural kinking, accompanied
by somite abnormalities, suggesting again, a role in
the determination or maintenance of the integrity of
the body axis. The varied features of axis will
provide important insights into the mechanism of
gene function at this complex locus. 


<p> The chromosomal region that includes axis
contains other genes that affect body axis and
skeletal development. Predictions of the potential
role of a gene or genes at axis will be presented, as
well as a view of the functional organization and
possible interactions of other loci in the region.
These analyses will give us essential data for
subsequent large-scale expansions of the functional
map of the mouse genome in parallel with human
gene maps using additional induced and targeted
deletions combined with chemical mutagenesis.

<p>One of the larger syntenically homologous blocks
of human and mouse genomes includes the long
arm of human chromosome 19 and the proximal
portion of mouse chromosome 7. As part of an
extensive comparative genome mapping of human
chromosome 19, we have targeted a region
spanning approximately 2.5 Mb near the telomere
of H19q. As a first step for characterization of this
region, we have assigned several known genes and
cDNA sequences to the 19q13.4 physical map.
Most genes assigned to this region are C2H2-type,
zinc finger (ZNF)-containing genes, which include
ZNF134, ZNF154, ZIK1, C2H2-25, and one EST
(T26651). These genes are all localized to a
centrally-located contig (577/1514) and KRAB
(Kruppel-associated box)-type ZNFs. To provide
clues for the potential role of these genes, the
expression-patterns of these ZNFs have been
determined; most genes are expressed ubiquitously
in all tissues examined but the highest expression
level for each gene has been observed in different
tissues. Using an interspecific backcross system,
we have mapped ZNF134-related sequences in the
mouse and confirmed that the mouse genome has
similar zinc-finger genes clusters in proximal Mmu
7. We are currently constructing mouse BAC
contigs and, at the same time, isolating the mouse
homologs or related genes for the human ZNFs
from these contigs. 


<p>Recently, we have also assigned the human
homolog of a mouse imprinted gene, Peg3
(paternally expressed gene 3), to a contig (174)
located approximately 1Mb proximal of a ZNF134
contig. Studies of several imprinted domains,
including Prader-Willi and Angelman
syndrome-region (H15q11-13)/central Mmu 7 and
Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome-region
(11p15.5)/distal Mmu7, indicated that genomic
imprinting is generally conserved among
mammalian species and also that imprinted
domains are large--spanning distances ranging
from several hundred kilobases to two megabases.
Due to these observations, we have decided to
characterize PEG3/Peg3-containing regions in both
human and mouse. In human, the adjacent contig
to a PEG3-contig appears to have numerous ZNFs.
In mouse, we have isolated two zinc finger genes
located very close to Peg3 and are currently
investigating the imprinting status and genomic
organization of these genes relative to Peg3.

<p>Chromosome duplication is a force that drives
evolution. We now suggest that this may also be
true of the primates and that the resulting
duplications in part determine the spectrum of
human chromosomal rearrangements. To
investigate the existence and origin of duplications
in the human genome, and their consequences,
5,000 bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs)
were mapped at 2-5 Mb resolution on human high
resolution chromosomes by using fluorescence in
situ hybridization. A subset of 469 of these was
defined that generated two or more signals,
excluding those located in regions of known
repeated sequences, viz., the regions of
centromeres, telomeres and ribosomal genes.
Although a subset of these multiple site BACs
represent the chimeric artifacts of cloning, derived
from two different chromosomal regions, others
reflect regions of true homology in the human
genome. 


<p>Two questions were considered; first, the extent to
which the multiple sites of hybridization of single
BACs within single chromosomes reflected the
breakpoints of naturally occurring human
inversions, and second, the extent to which these
same multiple hybridization points reflected the
chromosomal inversion points in primate evolution. 


<p>For human inversions, the results of the analyses
revealed a total of 124 BACs (2.5%) mapping to
two or more sites on the same chromosome, of
which 81 (65%) mapped to one of 27 distinct
human inversion sites, the largest share of which
recognized the well-established pericentromeric
inversions of chromosomes 1, 2, 9, and 18, as well
as the paracentric inverted region of chromosome
7q11/q22. From this, we infer that meiotic
mispairing involving the homologous regions may
be responsible for the inversions. 


<p>With respect to primate evolution, a significant
proportion of inversion breakpoints that
characterize the chromosomal changes seen in the
evolution of the great apes through man, are also
reflected in the distribution of BAC multiple
intrachromosomal sites. Further analyses of the 29
independent BACs recognizing the pericentromeric
region of human chromosome 9 suggest at least
three classes, two of which recognize only single
sites in Pan troglodytes. These data suggest that
inversions occurring through primate evolution
may generate small duplications that, although
they can cause chromosomal imbalance in single
individuals, they also provide the additional genetic
material for speciation.

<p>An in situ methodology employing solution
conditions has been developed for binding
oligodeoxyribonucleotide 'third-strands' to
chromosomal DNA targets in non-denatured
protein-depleted metaphase spreads and interphase
nuclei. Third-strand in situ hybridization (TISH)
was performed on slides at pH 6.0 using a dual
psoralen-and biotin-modified 17-nt pyrimidine-rich
third strand to target a unique multicopy sequence
in human chromosome 17 alpha-satellite (D17Z1
locus). UVA photofixed third strands, rendered
fluorescent by FITC-labeled avidin, are
reproducibly centromere-specific for chromosome
17, and visible without amplification in human
lymphocyte and somatic cell hybrid spreads and
interphase nuclei. Two D17Z1 haplotypes, one
positive and the other negative for third-strand
binding, were identified in three combinations (+/+,
+/-, and -/-). Third-strand probes specific for
unique multicopy alpha-satellite targets in human
chromosome X and 16 have also been developed.
Similar alpha-satellite target sequences have been
identified in 22 of the 24 human chromosomes,
making centromere-specific chromosome
identification by TISH applicable to virtually to all
human chromosomes. The technology is presently
being applied to chromosomes of other eukaryotes.
TISH has potential diagnostic, biochemical, and
flow cytometric applicability to native metaphase
and interphase chromatin.

<p>Human genetic polymorphisms are valuable for
extracting information about population structure
and evolutionary histories. Clonally inherited DNA
such as mitochondrial or Y chromosome-specific
DNA is of particular use due to lack of
recombination. Microsatellites have been used to
reconstruct human evolutionary histories. Until
recently, only six male-specific tetranucleotide
repeats have been publicly available as PCR
markers. We have developed six additional
microsatellite markers using a cosmid library of
flow-sorted human Y-chromosomes. These
microsatellites are tetranucleotide (GATA)n
repeats of nine to twelve repeat units each, and are
polymorphic among unrelated individuals. All
markers were analyzed using Applied Biosystems
Genescan fluorescent fragment sizing. At least
three alleles were identified for each marker when
diverse genomic DNAs were used as PCR
template. The allele sizes range from 162 to 372
nucleotides. An additional marker was identified,
having polymorphic alleles in both males and
females of sizes 217-237. These markers fall into
sets of non-overlapping alleles that allow for
efficient gel multiplexing with fluorescent dyes.
Because six of these markers are male-specific or
have male-specific alleles, they are valuable for
evolutionary and population studies where
non-recombining DNA is desired.

<p>Libraries of all or part of the mammalian genome
have been propagated in single cells and have been
used as tools in gene discovery through in vitro
analyses. We have expanded upon this concept by
the creation of panels of YAC and P1 transgenic
mice containing defined contiguous regions of the
mouse or human genome. Since each library
member contains a large (80-700 kb) transgene,
together several megabases of contiguous DNA
from a defined region of the genome can be
propagated using the mouse as a host. We have
successfully used such libraries to sift through
large genomic regions and to localize and clone
genes based on phenotyping members of the
library. Examples of our use of these libraries to
link sequence with function include: 

<p>  (1) Biological annotation of human 5q31
genomic sequence data. Computational
analysis of 1.2 Mb of sequence from human
5q31 generated as part of the JGI sequencing
program has revealed multiple putative genes
and exons. As a tool to validate the
computationally predicted novel genes in this
region, and to determine their site and timing
of expression, we have created and analyzed a
1.5 Mb in vivo library of human 5q31 and
documented the expression patterns of the
newly identified genes in the YAC transgenics. 

<p>  (2) Fine mapping a 5q31 QTL for asthma.
Several human studies have mapped a major
QTL determining IgE levels in asthmatics to
5q31. Through analysis of IgE levels in
members of the 5q31 in vivo library following
an airway irritant we have identified a single
YAC noted in two separate founder lines to be
associated with a marked decrease in IgE
levels. 


<p>We are in the process of looking at mice containing
fragments of this YAC to move from this disease
associated 5q31 QTL to the causative gene.

<p>  (1) In vivo complementation for cloning mouse
mutations. We developed an in vivo library of
the 550 kb region to which the mouse
recessive neurological mutation vibrator had
been localized by meiotic mapping. Through
the in vivo complementation of the phenotype
with a member of the library, we have been
able to fine map and than clone the gene
(PITP-N) responsible for the disorder. 

<p>  (2) Identifying genes contributing to defects in
cognition on chromosome 21. We have created
a 1.8 megabase in vivo library of human
chromosome 21q22.2 in a panel of YAC
transgenic mice. Analysis of these animals
with regard to learning and behavior identified
a 550 kb YAC responsible for specific
deficits. Through fragmentation of the YAC
we have been able to identifying a gene
(GIRK) whose altered level of expression is
responsible for behavioral abnormalities in
mice, a gene whose altered expression has also
been linked to learning defects in Drosophila. 


<p>These studies on panels of transgenic mice
containing large inserts have effectively enabled
phenotypic assays at the organismal level to be
performed on many genes at once. This, in essence,
constitutes a multiplex analysis that permits
increased throughput of data collection relating
sequence to phenotype.

<p>Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes (BACs) are
extensively used for large-scale mapping and
sequencing. In order to identify and characterize
BAC clones for contig assembly, we have
developed a rapid fingerprinting method using
fluorescently labeled dideoxyadenosine
triphosphates ([F]ddATP). Taq FS incorporates
[F]ddATP at the first nucleotide of a 5' overhang
generated by Hind III digestion. The labeled
fragments are further digested by four-base cutters
to generate even smaller fragments (less than 500
bp) for visualization on sequencing gel. The
reaction uses [F]ddATP labeled with one of three
mobility-matched fluorescent dyes for fragments of
each four-base cutter. They allow to multiplex the
analysis in a single gel lane. The fourth color in the
same lane is used to identify the location of the
fragments of known molecular weights and then to
calculate the size of each fragments based on that
result. Fragment size data assigned by Genescan
(ABI) are converted into FPC (Fingerprinted
Contigs, Sanger Center, UK) format and then
electronically transferred to FPC for automatic
contig assembly. We have tested the system on one
of the most well characterized BAC contigs of
human chromosome 22; 96 BACs from the
chromosome 22 regions where large-scale
sequencing is underway. Without manual
intervention, the system did not produce false
overlap in all 96 BAC clones, and assembled 16
contigs and 31 singletons. The accuracy of
overlaps constructed by the method is comparable
to that established using BAC end sequence, and
compared with completely sequenced BACs.


<p>Fragments patterns determined by this method
provide each BAC with digital fingerprint, and
may be stored for searching clones with minimal
overlap, and for identification of clones.

a variety of research areas of Human Genome
Project because of their stability in <I>E. coli</I>, easy
handling of BAC DNA, and relatively large insert
size. Over the past four years, we have generated
over 400,000 BAC clones from two individuals,
and arrayed them in 384-well microtiter plates to
organize these clones. Recently we initiated a new
round of construction of BAC libraries for the
community involved in the high throughput
sequencing efforts. In order to build high quality
libraries, we have implemented many checks and
extensive experiments to test for the degree of
representation and the degree to which BACs
accurately reflect the human genome. We extend
our improved quality control procedures to the new
library making endeavor. For these libraries, we
made a new generation BAC vector,
pIndigoBAC45 which gives much darker blue
colored colonies on the X-gal plates. This feature
enables us to identify clones with inserts more
accurately, resulting low percentage of empty
clones, and to shorten the time required for library
construction. To estimate the number of empty
wells and the number of clones that lack inserts,
we stamp all the clones from each 384-well
microtiter plates onto LB agar-plates. This detects
mistakes made during colony picking procedure.
To check for chimerism, co-habitation of wells by
multiple clones, and representation of the human
genome, we end-sequence BACs and carry out RH
mapping based on PCR using primers designed by
the sequences. In collaboration with Mark Adams
at TIGR, we have sequenced thus far both ends
about 1,000 BAC clones in the newly constructed
BAC library. Furthermore, we plan to compare
new libraries with previously constructed BAC
libraries by testing with the same probes used for
these libraries. We will report the progress of these
library construction and discuss quality of these
BAC clones.

<p>The major goals of the Human Genome Project are
the identification and the localization of
50,000-100,000 genes expected in the human
genome, the generation of physical maps for each
individual chromosome, and finally, the
determination of the nucleotide sequence for the
entire 30,000 megabase pairs of DNA. There is a
clear need to develop reliable clone resources
which are accurately mapped and at the same time
can provide templates for direct use in large scale
sequencing. A new generation of cloning system,
the Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes (BACs), has
been developed in our lab and is now extensively
used throughout the community in a variety of
research areas.


<p>To initially demonstrate the usefulness of the BAC
system for long range physical mapping, a scaffold
integrated contig map of the entire long arm of
chromosome 22 was constructed. Individual clones
were ordered into contigs by fingerprint analysis
and placed along the genomic stretch according to
their content of genetic anchorpoints. The map
consists of more than 700 BAC clones and spans
the length of approximately 45 megabase pairs.
Each BAC clone is further characterized by
fluorescence fingerprinting and end-sequencing the
inserts. Sequence information of the clone ends is
presently used to select new clones from the 15x
coverage BAC library, which extend contigs and
close the gaps.


<p>Our ultimate goal is to generate a well
characterized collection of BACs, which provides
complete physical coverage of the entire long arm
of chromosome 22 with minimal overlaps. This
map will serve as an excellent resource to discover
all of the transcripts mapped on the chromosome,
and can readily be used for cost-efficient genomic
DNA sequencing with minimal redundancy.

<p>Researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory
are developing a highly automated
integrated-circuit based research tool for
subdermal monitoring of physiological parameters
in mice used for gene expression studies.
Application of this new instrumentation capability
to genome studies will accelerate mass specimen
screening by providing automated detailed
observation and reporting of multiple key
physiological parameters of interest. Body
temperature, heart rate, physical activity level,
movement trajectory, and possibly blood pressure
will be measured by an implanted integrated-circuit
based instrument containing multiple integrated
sensors. Measured data will be transmitted
periodically via wireless techniques for subsequent
data processing, visualization, fusion, and storage.
The integrated sensor/telemetry package will be
low-cost, reusable, and sufficiently miniaturized to
be directly injectable. The system will provide
detailed parameter measurement and analysis
capabilities not presently available to genomics
researchers. Advanced multi-parametric data
presentation will permit improved detail and
accuracy in high-volume phenotype screening and
increased detectability of subtle genetic defects.
This paper will present preliminary information on
parameter measurement methods, sensor selection,
instrument and system architectures, instrument
miniaturization techniques, and data processing

<p>Beryllium alloys are used in several industrial
processes and products, including the synthesis of
components of nuclear weapons. Chronic
beryllium disease (CBD) affects a percentage of
human individuals exposed to airborne particles of
beryllium. CBD is an autoimmune disease
affecting the lungs of susceptible individuals.
Antigen-presenting cell surface proteins have been
the focus of investigation into possible genetic
susceptibility to this disease. It was discovered
previously that certain HLA-DP&szlig;1 alleles
correlated with the development of CBD. Because
the suspected allele is also found in normal
populations at frequencies of over 40% it was
necessary to collect sequence information from
more individuals. In order to determine if the
implicated genotype, with a Glu-69 mutation, was
the sole contributing mutation we sequenced over
30 individuals for exon II of this locus. More than
90% of disease individuals possessed the Glu-69
mutation, although most of these were in the
heterozygous state. This larger data set supports
previous results, but because of the high frequency
of this mutation in normal individuals it will
require more extensive investigation to determine if
other contributing genetic factors are present. In
addition to this locus, we are sequencing two other
MHC Class II HLA loci, HLA-DQ&szlig;1 and
HLA-DR&szlig;1 for CBD correlating genotypes.
Screening for susceptibility to CBD will require
robust assays, and the development of a genetic
screen is one goal of this research.

<p>The Oak Ridge National Laboratory has recently
begun the development of a new high-resolution,
high-throughput 3-D mouse imaging and
computer-aided screening methodology to rapidly
identify, quantify and record subtle phenotypes in
mutagenized mice. The research goals for this
program are to develop a novel x-ray imaging
technology with &lt;50 mm spatial resolution, a 3-D
data acquisition time of &lt;1 minute per mouse and
an estimated cost of a few dollars per image. A key
element of this new system will be a novel
cadmium zinc telluride detector operating in pulse
counting mode. This new detector technology
provides spatial resolutions and x-ray energy
discrimination capabilities unattainable with
traditional x-ray computed tomography detectors.
Due to its high atomic number, the new detector is
also suitable for traditional nuclear medicine
studies. Additionally, new image processing and
pattern recognition algorithms will be developed
for the system to assist researchers in identifying
phenotypes. In this paper we present the objectives
and approach for this research program and some

<p>We have developed an enzymatic assay for direct,
sensitive and quantitative nucleic acid detection.
This assay is based on cleavage of a unique
secondary structure that can be formed between
two DNA probe oligonucleotides and a target
nucleic acid of interest. The assay depends on the
coordinate action between the two synthetic
oligonucleotides. By the extent of their
complementarity to the target strand, each of these
oligonucleotides defines a specific region of the
target strand. These regions are oriented such that
when the two oligonucleotides are hybridized to the
target strand, the 3' end of the upstream
oligonucleotide overlaps with the 5' end of the
labeled downstream "signal" oligonucleotide. The
resulting structure is recognized by a
structure-specific nuclease, which cuts the signal
oligonucleotide to release a labeled fragment.
When the reaction contains an excess of the signal
molecules and is performed at elevated temperature
to promote rapid dissociation and association of
these molecules, the cleaved signal oligonucleotide
is readily replaced by an intact copy so that the
process can be repeated. In this way many signal
molecules are cleaved for each copy of the target
nucleic acid. The amount of target present may
then be calculated from the yield of cleavage
product, the rate of product accumulation and the
time of incubation. 


<p>We have found that the accumulation of cleaved
product is linear over both time and target
concentration, with the rate of accumulation
dependent on the turnover rate of the enzyme. With
a turnover rate of about 35 cleavage events per
minute, our current system permits signal to be
amplified by more than 1000-fold, compared to
single round hybridization, in 30 minutes, thus
allowing the quantitative detection of sub-attomole
levels of target nucleic acid.


<p>Quantitative detection of nucleic acids in this
fashion has several advantages over other methods
of oligonucleotide-based detection. Foremost,
because the cleavage requires the precise
coordination and hybridization of two
oligonucleotides, this reaction has a high level of
specificity for the intended target sequence. The
specificity of the detection is further enhanced
because the investigator can select the site of
cleavage in the signal molecule by designing the
appropriate amount of overlap with the upstream
oligonucleotide. The production of a discrete
cleavage product of expected size allows that
product to be more easily distinguished from the
products of oligonucleotide destruction that may
arise from thermal degradation or from nuclease
contaminants in diagnostic test samples. Further,
the use of oligonucleotides that are mostly or
completely composed of DNA, rather than RNA,
eliminates background that could arise from
target-independent degradation by ribonucleases.
Finally, because each cleavage event is dependent
on the presence of the actual target material, and
not on the products of the cleavage reaction,
contamination by material carried over from
completed detection reactions cannot induce
additional signal in subsequent reactions. We have
applied this method to direct detection of DNA
targets such as DNA viral genomes, and to the
detection of mRNA for monitoring of gene
expression. Judicious placement of the
oligonucleotide pair around splice junctions allows
mRNA detection without prior destruction of
genomic DNA. The products of the cleavage
reaction can be analyzed by gel electrophoresis, or
by non-gel methods such as capture to solid
support. We will show how additional
post-cleavage manipulation of the products can
lower the limit of detection by 2 to 3 orders of
magnitude when compared to gel-based readout.

<p> The construction of high resolution physical maps
and definition of a minimal tiling path are
indispensable for directed approaches to large
scale DNA sequencing. Similarly, closure of gaps
and completion of shot-gun sequencing projects
depends on knowledge of the physical location and
size of gaps. We applied 'Quantitative DNA Fiber
Mapping (QDFM)', an optical procedure for
mapping based on hybridization of fluorescently
labeled probes on to individual stretched DNA
molecules, for construction of high resolution
physical maps and definition of minimal tiling
paths as well as for quality control of sequencing
templates derived from human chromosome 20.
Digital image analysis allowed localization of
probes with near kilobase(kb)-resolution in
intervals of several hundred kb<sup>(1,2)</sup>. When the
technique was applied to construct physical maps
for regions on the proximal long arms of human
chromosomes 11 and 22 <sup>(3)</sup>, respectively, we
encountered numerous unstable yeast artificial
chromosome (YAC) clones. Deletions in these
YACs prohibited their use for map construction.
We therefore modified our mapping scheme and
prepared DNA fibers comprised of genomic DNA.
This proved to be a rapid method for determination
of clone overlap and genomic distances between
genes or markers. Furthermore, the genomic fibers
provide a 'gold standard' for validation of clones
and their contigs as well as the delineation of
deletions in large clones. Compared to mapping on
to fibers that were prepared from cloned fragments
and purified by pulsed field gel electrophoresis,
genomic DNA fibers are expected to significantly
shorten the mapping cycle time, because slides
carrying these fibers can be prepared in large
batches and stored. The use of genomic fiber slides
for mapping will also facilitate the implementation
of standardized protocols that are amenable to
automation and increase the mapping throughput.
Using clones derived from selected regions on
human chromosomes 5 and 16, respectively, we
are presently evaluating the utility of genomic
fibers for clone/contig validation.

<p>Gene dosage alterations underlie many diseases.
For example, variations in DNA sequence copy
number are associated with a significant
proportion of the genetic aberrations involved in
cancers, and also with certain developmental
abnormalities. Comparative genomic hybridization
(CGH) has proven to be an effective method for
detecting and mapping these genetic alterations. In
CGH total genomic DNA from a test specimen and
a normal genomic reference DNA are labeled with
different fluorochromes and hybridized to normal
metaphase chromosomes. The ratio of the
fluorescence intensities at a location on the
chromosomes is approximately proportional to the
ratio of sequences in the test and reference
genomes that bind there. The use of metaphase
chromosomes as the hybridization target has
previously limited the resolution of CGH to 10-20
Mb. However, we have now implemented a new
form of high resolution CGH by replacing the
normal metaphase spread with an array of genomic
cosmid, P1, and BAC clones (Sudar et al., these
Abstracts). This approach provides a resolution at
least a factor of 100 better than standard CGH, as
it is determined only by the size and spacing of the
target genomic clones. Thus, measurements of
copy number can be made at low resolution on
clones spaced at several Mb, or at high resolution
using closely spaced or overlapping clones. We
have performed both low and high resolution
analyses of the DNA sequence copy number
variation occurring on chromosome 20 in breast
cancer and in pre-cancerous models. A low
resolution, 'scanning' array of the entire
chromosome was constructed from genomic clones
spaced at ~1-3 Mb intervals on human
chromosome 20. The analysis of breast tumors and
breast tumor cell lines revealed at least five
independent regions of copy number increase and a
region of decrease on 20q that were present in
various combinations. Thus, multiple, interacting
genes involved in breast and perhaps other cancers
may be located on 20q. Two of these regions were
also recurrently present at elevated copy number in
HPV-immortalized keratinocytes, suggesting that
the processes of tumorigenesis in vivo and
immortalization of cells in culture may proceed
through common pathways of amplification and
overexpression of certain genes mapping to these
two loci. High resolution analysis was also
performed on breast tumors with elevated copy
number occurring within a ~1 Mb region at
20q13.2. The array was composed of contiguous
and overlapping clones from a contig that has been
constructed spanning this region (Collins et al.,
these Abstracts). For some tumors, a constant level
of elevated copy number was observed across the
region. However, in others, an abrupt variation in
copy number was recorded, which mapped the
boundaries of different levels of amplification to
within a fraction of a BAC or P1 clone. These
copy number alterations measured with array CGH
are concordant with data obtained by using the
array target clones as probes for interphase
fluorescent in situ hybridization. However array
CGH appeared to be both more quantitative and
substantially faster, since only one hybridization
was required to obtain the data at all loci. The
increasing availability of genomic resources and
the technology to print arrays with more than 104
elements/cm2 (Sudar et al., these Abstracts) make
it reasonable to consider performing genome-wide
analyses of copy number variation using arrays
that would provide 1 Mb or better resolution for
the entire human genome.

<p>High level amplification of chromosome 20 band
13.2 occurs in 10% of primary breast tumors and
correlates with poor prognosis in node negative
patients. This amplification is also detected in
numerous other solid tumors including bladder,
brain, colon, head and neck and melanoma. We
hypothesize that selection for overexpression of
one or more genes encoded within this amplicon
drives the 20q13.2 amplification event. To fine
map the amplicon and identify the hypothesized
oncogene(s) a 1.0 Mb interval spanning the
amplicon was cloned in contiguous BAC, PAC,
and P1 clones.


<p> To fully explore the genomics of the 20q13.2
amplicon we have sequenced ~ 80% of the 1 Mb
contig and analyzed it extensively for genes using a
suite of bioinformatics tools. This combined with
exon trapping and cDNA direct selection has led to
the discovery of four genes ZABC1, ZABC2,
NABC1, PIC1-related and a new cyclophilin
pseudogene. ZABC2 may be the ortholog of the
Drosophila melanogaster homeotic gene tea shirt.
PIC1-related is ~ 93% identical to PIC1 or sentrin,
a gene that encodes a ubiquitin-homology domain
protein. NABC1 encodes a novel cytoplasmic
protein of unknown function. ZABC1 is especially
interesting. The cDNA sequence of ZABC1 is
predicted to encode a putative transcription factor
containing eight C2H2 zinc finger domains. To
manage this data and make it available to
collaborators we have developed a tailored
ACEDB database accessible via the World-Wide
Web (Davy et al, these abstracts).


<p>A ~260 kb "minimum common amplicon" was
defined by performing interphase FISH using P1
and BAC probes from the sequence-ready contig
on ~300 primary tumors. ZABC1 is centrally
located in the 260 kb critical region. Quantitative
PCR and Northern analysis were employed to
analyze the expression of this gene in breast cancer
cell lines and primary tumors. Expression of
ZABC1 is elevated in all cell lines and tumors in
which it is amplified. High level expression of
ZABC1 was found in the breast cancer cell line
600MPE, a notable finding because 600MPE is
not amplified at the ZABC1 locus. This suggests
alternative mechanisms may elevate ZABC1
transcripts in some tumors. ZABC1 is the only
transcribed sequence identified that maps in the
260 kb critical region with a pattern of expression
so strongly correlated with copy number. The
murine ortholog of ZABC1 has been cloned to
study its expression in murine mammary tumors
and its normal spatial and temporal pattern of
expression.


<p>We have now constructed a BAC contig across the
mouse ZABC1 locus. It is our goal to sequence
this contig and identify conserved noncoding
regulatory elements through comparative sequence
analysis. BACs from the contig will also be used to
determine if ZABC1 is amplified in murine
mammary tumors. It is anticipated that the
combination of comparative and functional
genomics will elucidate key regulatory elements of
the ZABC1 gene and lead to insights regarding the
mechanism of amplification at 20q13.2. In
addition, comparative genomic hybridization to
DNA microarrays is being used to map this
amplicon at unprecedented resolution revealing
new regions of consistent copy number
abnormalities and suggesting additional co-selected
and counter-selected genes involved in the
evolution breast tumors (Albertson et al., these
abstracts).

<p>The Resource for Molecular Cytogenetics is
developing computer assisted microscopy and
image analysis techniques to allow combined
genotypic and phenotypic analysis of intact cells in
tissue. The long range goal is to obtain quantitative
information about the copy number of DNA
sequences, levels of expression of RNA and
proteins and their distributions in cells; to
morphologically characterize cells, nuclei and
other organelles, and to analyze the cellular
organization of tissue. This information will
contribute to our understanding of functional
processes in normal and diseased tissue involving
candidate genes. Some of these genes will have
been discovered using genome-wide surveillance
techniques, such as array-based comparative
genomic hybridization(CGH).

<p> 

<p>The technical procedure we have adopted for this
project, which is at an early stage, is as follows:
Adjacent thin (4 micron) and thick (30 micron)
sections are cut from cancer specimens. The thin
sections are used for standard histological staging,
while the thick sections are used for quantifying
the specific molecular species of interest in the
individual cells. Thick sections are employed,
because they contain intact cells, thus permitting
accurate quantification at the individual cell level,
and the cellular organization of the tissue is
preserved. However, such sections require careful
optimization of fluorescent in situ hybridization
(FISH) and immunocytochemical procedures for
labeling the particular molecular species, followed
by 3D (confocal) microscopic image acquisition
and 3D image analysis. We have developed several
image analysis programs for this project. The first
interactively enumerates punctate FISH signals in
the individual intact nuclei of thick sections, and
the second registers adjacent thick and thin
sections. It is thus now possible to use this
procedure to study the relationship between the
copy number of specific genomic sequences in
individual cells and histological stage of the tissue.
In a preliminary application to a breast biopsy
specimen, we demonstrated that histologically
benign regions contained cells with two copies of a
chromosome 1 alpha-satellite probe, whereas
invasive cancer regions had variable copy numbers
per cell of the probe. We are continuing these
experiments in order to determine the degree of
genetic heterogeneity in tumor cells and
surrounding histologically normal tissue.

<p> 

<p>The image analysis programs mentioned above
limit the procedure to the enumeration of punctate
FISH signals in each cell. In order to expand the
range of applications, we have developed
algorithms for segmenting individual cell nuclei
within thick sections. This enables quantification
of diffuse molecular markers inside nuclei, the size
and shape of nuclei, the spatial positions of FISH
signals inside the nuclei, and the spatial
relationships of cells to each other in the tissue.
The input to the algorithms is a 3D image of nuclei
labeled with a DNA counterstain. The first of the
algorithms automatically thresholds the image into
regions of background and nuclei. The next
algorithm is a custom-designed, interactive 3D
rendering program, which the analyst uses to
inspect each nuclear region and indicate if each
region is a single nucleus or a cluster of nuclei.
Clusters are then divided by an automatic
algorithm, which employs a variant of the Hough
transform to shrink nuclei and consequently
separate them. The resulting divided regions are
presented to the analyst, who indicates if they are
nuclei, are still clusters, or have been incorrectly
divided and should be rejoined. The alternating
steps of automatic cluster division and human
inspection are repeated as many times as necessary
to correctly segment all nuclei in the image.

Current molecular biology techniques were developed primarily for characterization of single
genes, not entire genomes, and, as such, are not ideally suited to high resolution analysis of
complex traits and the molecular genetics of very large populations.  Despite rapid progress in the
human genome project effort, there is little doubt that radically new conceptual approaches are
needed before routine whole genome-based analyses can be undertaken by both basic research and
clinical laboratories. 
<P>
Physical mapping of genomes, using restriction endonucleases, has played a major role in the
identification and characterizing various loci, for example, by aiding clone contig formation and by
characterizing genetic lesions.  Restriction maps provide precise genomic distances, unlike
ordered sequence-based landmarks such as Sequence Tagged Sites (STSs), that are essential for
optimizing the efficiency of sequencing efforts,  and for determining the spatial relationships of
specific loci.  When compared to tedious hybridization-based fingerprinting approaches, ordered
restriction maps offer relatively unambiguous clone characterization that is useful in contig
formation, establishment of minimal tiling paths for sequencing, and preliminary characterization
of sequence lesions.  In addition, such maps provide a useful scaffold for sequence assembly,
often critical in the final sequence finishing stage. Despite the broad applications of restriction
maps, the associated techniques for their generation have changed little over the last ten years,
primarily because they still utilize electrophoretic analysis.  To help overcome these shortcomings,
our laboratory developed the first practical non-electrophoretic genomic mapping approach,
Optical Mapping, to meet this need.  
<P>
Optical Mapping is a single molecule methodology for the rapid production of ordered restriction
maps from single DNA molecules.  Ordered  restriction maps were constructed originally from
yeast chromosomes by imaging restriction endonuclease cutting events on single, stained DNA
molecules with fluorescence microscopy.  Cut sites appeared as gaps that widened as the DNA
fragments relaxed. Maps were then constructed by measuring fragment sizes via relative
fluorescence intensity or apparent length measurements. Modern Optical Mapping technology
uses aminosilane treated surfaces to adhere molecules prior to digestion.  In this way, multiple
samples can be robotically gridded onto a single surface and digested in parallel.  Deposition
techniques developed in our laboratory elongate and fix molecules to these surfaces, while
retaining biochemical accessibility of samples. Following staining with a fluorochrome, cleaved
molecules are imaged by a fully-automated microscope system, developed in our laboratory. 
Importantly, cleaved molecule fragments retain their order, facilitating fragment sizing and
obviating complicated schemes to re-establish fragment order.  The final map is of course, a very
informative ordered restriction map instead of a mere fingerprint.
<P>
Intensive effort in our laboratory have been directed to the development of machine vision
systems, and map construction algorithms to automatically construct maps from images of
digested molecules.  This analysis is based on Bayesian inference techniques and enables the
construction of maps from noisy data.  For example, the map construction algorithms can produce
maps from a population of partially digested clone molecules, (BACs, cosmids, phage) having a
digestion rate as low as 15%.
<P>
Using the approaches discussed above, this laboratory has generated ordered  restriction maps for
the Beckwith-Wiedeman locus in humans (in collaboration with Dr. D. Housman's group at
MIT), the Brca2 locus (in collaboration with Dr. S. Fisher's group at Columbia University),  and
the mouse olfactory locus (in collaboration with Dr. R. Axel's group at Columbia University). 
Optical Maps are currently being generated from phage, cosmid, YAC and Bacterial Artificial
Chromosome (BAC) clones. Our laboratory has been extensively mapping BAC contigs derived
from the human Y chromosome, in collaboration with Dr. David Page's group at MIT.  The aims
are to disambiguate clones and markers to provide the basis from which to critically understand
the functionality of many loci, and provide a scaffold for sequence assembly.  The detailed analysis
of the Y chromosome requires such detailed maps, since it is highly punctuated with repeated
sequences, that frequently confound traditional techniques of characterization.  
<P>
More recent efforts have been directed at the high resolution mapping of bacterial (in
collaboration with Dr. O. White, TIGR) and parasite genomes (in collaboration with Drs. M.
Gardner, D. Carucci; TIGR, Naval Medical Research Institute) to provide high resolution
scaffolds for facilitated sequence assembly and verification.  Here, we have been using high
molecular weight DNA gently extracted from cells, entirely obviating the need for the mapping of
clonal material. We have used Optical Mapping to generate physical maps of two microbial
genomes. Nhe I maps of the <I>E. coli</i> (4.6Mb) and <I>Deinococcus radiodurans</i>
(3.1Mb) genomes were generated from chromosomal DNA, obviating the use of clones for the
construction of primary maps. DNA samples, prepared from gel inserts, were fixed onto
derivatized glass surfaces and molecules as large as 2.4 Mb were measured. Co-mounted lambda
bacteriophage DNA was used as a sizing standard and to estimate cutting efficiency. Contig maps
were created by aligning maps from multiple molecules. To benchmark our system, we compared
the <I>E. coli</i> Nhe I optical map with the map predicted from the published sequence. The
150 fragment optical map had average fragment size 30 kb and a relative sizing error of 5 per cent
for fragments >5 kb. We then generated a whole genome Nhe I map of the <I>D. radiodurans</i>
genome. The final map was assembled without gaps at an average depth of 35X, using 157
molecules with an average restriction fragment size of 29 kb. This map will significantly aid
sequence assembly and verification to collaborators at TIGR, sequencing this microorganism.
<P>
Full automation of Optical Mapping holds enormous promise for miniaturization, with expected
increases in throughput and reductions in cost.  Thus, advantages of Optical Mapping include high
throughput and resolution, safety, and low cost. Compared with traditional electrophoresis-based
methods, Optical Mapping produces information rich physical maps for whole genomes with
much higher a resolution. High throughput and the obviation of clones makes Optical Mapping
ideally suited for population-based genomic studies.We expect that the advantages of Optical
Mapping will facilitate closure of the initial objectives of the human genome project, and aid in
reducing costs associated with the sequencing of microbial genomes.
