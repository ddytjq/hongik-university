for a Haploid Species</font></font></u></b></center>

<p>summary from pp. 514 - 516 of Haldane's "The Cost of Natural Selection"
<p>Let <b>p<sub> n</sub></b> be the frequency of an allele <b>A </b>in
any generation n, and <b>q<sub> n</sub></b> be the frequency of an alternative
allele <b>a</b> at the same locus for a haploid organism.
<p>If (1 - <b>s</b>) of individuals carrying the a allele survive for every
one of A, then selection acts on the individuals as follows:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; At the start of the generation, frequencies for A and
a will be p<sub>n</sub> and q<sub>n</sub> respectively. After selection,
the frequencies of A and and a will change to p<sub>n</sub> / (1-sq<sub>n</sub>)
and (1 - s) * q<sub>n</sub> / (1-sq<sub>n</sub>).
<p>In his calculations of the substitution cost, Haldane chose to ignore
the denominator (1 -sq<sub>n</sub>) for small s. For instance, if s is
.01 and q is .99, the denominator would be 1 - 0.01*.99 which equals 0.9901.
Ignoring the denominator introduces an error of 1 - 0.9901&nbsp; = 0.0099
in one generation. This is an error of less than 1% per generation, and
it will go down as q is reduced. (In fact, the maximum error will always
be s, the selection coefficient.) Haldane felt this could be ignored, but
others have disagreed with Haldane on this point.
<p>The&nbsp; fraction of selective deaths due to natural selection for
a single generation is then given as follows:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>d</b> <b><sub>n</sub></b> = s*q<sub>n</sub>
<br>That is because (ignoring the denominator), the new value of q is given
as (1 - s)q<sub>n</sub> and s*q<sub>n</sub> is the fraction of selective
deaths.
<p>If <b>q<sub> n+1</sub> </b>is defined as the frequency of the a allele
after a round of selection,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; q<sub>n+1<b>&nbsp;</b></sub> = [(1 - s)*q<sub> n</sub>]/[p<sub>
n</sub> + (1 - s)*q<sub> n</sub>]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; q<sub>n+1</sub> = [(1 - s)*q/[p<sub> n</sub> + q<sub>
n</sub> - s*q<sub> n</sub>]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; q<sub>n+1</sub> = [(1 - s)*q<sub> n</sub>]/[1 -
s*q<sub> n</sub>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Because p<sub> n</sub> + q<sub> n</sub> = 1.)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The change in q ( <b><font face="Symbol">D</font>q</b>
) due to one generation of natural selection is given by:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Symbol">D</font>q<b> </b>= q<sub>n+1</sub>
- q<sub> n</sub>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Symbol">D</font>q = -s*p<sub> n</sub>
*q<sub> n</sub> /[ 1 - s*q<sub> n</sub>]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="delta_q_n_haploid.html">Derivation of <font face="Symbol">D</font>q
for a Haploid Organism</a>
<p>From this, we can see that for any generation n, q<sub>n </sub>is given
by:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; q<sub>n</sub> = [1 + (1 - s)<sup>-n</sup> * (q<sub>0</sub><sup>-1</sup>-
1)]<sup>-1</sup>
<p>Well, Haldane thought that this was obvious from inspection, but follow
the link below to see how this equation can be derived.
<br>&nbsp;<a href="Deriv_q_n.html">Derivation of the equation for q<sub>n</sub></a>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Since&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d <sub>n</sub> = s*q<sub>n </sub>gives
the number of deaths due to selection in a single generation ( as a fraction
of the population size), we can find the total number of selective deaths
(<b>D</b>) ( as a&nbsp; fraction of the initial population size).
<p>By summing the selective deaths over all generations of the selection
process:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; D =&nbsp; <font face="Symbol"><font size=+1>S</font><font size=-2><sup>&yen;</sup></font></font><sub><font size=-2>n=1</font></sub>
s*q<sub>n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </sub>(This is the summation from n=1
to infinity of s*q<sub>n</sub>.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; D = s*<font face="Symbol"><font size=+1>S</font><font size=-2><sup>&yen;</sup></font></font><sub><font size=-2>n=1</font></sub>
q<sub>n</sub>
<p>This D, the summation of selective deaths over all generations of a
substitution is what Haldane defined as the <b>Cost of Natural Selection</b>.
<p>Haldane continues at this point to derive an equation to determine the
cost for any value of s and p<sub>0</sub>. Using calculus, he determines
that the cost is independent of everything but the initial value of p.
The cost is given by the equation:
<p>D = -ln(p<sub>0</sub>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( ln is the natural logarithm.)
<p>Follow the link below if you would like to see details of how this equation
is found:
<br>&nbsp;<a href="Deriv_hap_integral.html">Derivation for the Cost of
Selection for a Haploid Organism</a>
<p>According to Haldane's equation for the cost, if a gene is present in
1 individual in a population of 10,000; the cost for it to become fixed
(at 100%) is given as:
<p>D = -ln(1/10000) = 9.21. What this cost means is that in order for the
substitution to take place, 9.21 times the population will be required
in selective deaths. In other words, in our population of 10,000, approximately
92,100 individuals will have to die in order for the substitution to occur.
<p>Note that the cost is entirely dependent upon p<sub>0</sub>. Here is
a table showing the cost for several values of p<sub>0</sub>:
<br><tt>&nbsp; p<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Cost</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;---------&nbsp;&nbsp; ----</tt>
<br><tt><sub>&nbsp;</sub>0.01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4.6</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;0.001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.9</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;0.0001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.2</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;0.00001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.5</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;0.000001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13.8</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;0.0000001&nbsp;&nbsp; 16.1</tt>
<p><tt>To summarize, the Cost of Natural Selection is the number of selective
deaths required to fix an allele in a population. The cost for a haploid
organism is entirely dependent upon the initial value of the frequency
of the allele to be fixed and is given by the equation D = </tt>-ln(p<sub>0</sub>).
