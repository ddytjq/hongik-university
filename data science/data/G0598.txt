            <p></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If 
              you follow astronomy reporting in U.S. newspapers, you are probably 
              used to reading the syndicated copy of some of the very best science 
              reporters (from such newspapers as The New York Times, The Boston 
              Globe, or The Los Angeles Times.) But these reporters, many of whom 
              have some training in science, and who generally belong to a trade 
              organization called the National Association of Science Writers, 
              are really the cream of the profession. Under that cream comes a 
              much larger group of reporters, editors, and radio and TV people 
              whose training and judgment have become a cause for national concern. 
              </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
              the old days, many journalists were trained in some academic subject 
              (or self-trained) and went out to report the news. Today, there 
              are over 400 schools or departments of journalism in the US (although 
              many are slowly changing their names to include words like communication 
              and media Å in part because many of their graduates hope to earn 
              large salaries reading the news from cue cards on television.) These 
              graduates, armed with courses as unspecific and muddled as anything 
              our schools of education can come up with, are beginning to fill 
              the ranks of the radio, television, and print media in the country. 
              Many have minimal or no training in science and a good fraction 
              share the larger public's distrust of and sense of intimidation 
              by scientists. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Even 
              many of the elite journalists in the first group don't do as much 
              digging and reporting these days as you might imagine. They have 
              a kind of symbiotic relationship with the public information officers 
              at universities, research labs, and scientific societies, whose 
              job it is to get out the news from their institution and have it 
              be as widely disseminated as possible. (The two groups are actually 
              so interwoven that journalists frequently move from one to the other 
              and back again with ease.) Because no reporter can keep up with 
              all that is happening in every science, many have come to rely on 
              public information officers to identify noteworthy stories for them. 
              And those are usually the stories that are then developed. There 
              are exceptions &#151; often stories with a local angle or a whiff 
              of scandal &#151; but many journalists are happy to pluck the fruit 
              from the low hanging branches of the information tree; it is rare 
              to see them do much climbing on their own. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
              San Francisco, for example, the majority of non-local astronomy 
              stories the public has gotten to read or hear about in the past 
              two years have been determined by only two processes: 1. what stories 
              Steve Maran, the Public Information Officer of the American Astronomical 
              Society, decides to feature at the society meeting press conferences 
              (which are attended by many top science reporters whose stories 
              are frequently syndicated around the country); and 2. what stories 
              NASA and Space Telescope Science Institute public information officers 
              decide to hold news conferences or issue illustrated news releases 
              about. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When 
              the non-elite group of journalists cover some science story (especially 
              on radio and TV), they often do so reluctantly and frequently make 
              a muddle of it. Or they wind up simply rewriting a press release 
              or wire service copy, or focusing on a local scientist who can comment 
              in 20 seconds on the story. Furthermore, it often turns out that 
              most of what these journalists call science news is actually news 
              about medicine or applied technology. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> It 
              is these second-tier journalists who often get confused (to make 
              the most charitable interpretation) between science and pseudoscience. 
              They were the ones who reacted to the Nancy Reagan astrology revelations 
              by interviewing local astrologers (who made it all sound like the 
              most natural thing in the world that the president's schedule should 
              be determined by astrological forecasting) and by doing puff pieces 
              on all the movie stars that also guided their lives by astrology. 
              </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But 
              there is another part of modern journalism, which more rarely gets 
              discussed: the gatekeepers of the media. Decisions about what gets 
              on the evening news are usually not made by the people you watch 
              on your screen. Decisions about what gets significant coverage in 
              the newspapers are not made by the people whose bylines you know. 
              Decisions about what topics are discussed on the radio are often 
              not made by the people whose voices you hear. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Making 
              these decision is the role of the gate-keepers, editors and producers 
              who filter the news, select the stories to be covered, and direct 
              the tone of the material that will be read on the air. These gate-keepers 
              are often young, superficially educated, and lack any serious knowledge 
              of science. Yet they are the ones who assign the stories to reporters, 
              determine the length of articles or broadcast pieces, and decide 
              where these pieces will appear. They have been, many of them, raised 
              on a steady diet of the kind of journalism we now have, and so accept 
              the current system without question. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Furthermore, 
              it is this group, more than the reporters, that is actually charged 
              with minding the corporate bottom line at their institutions, and 
              is thus most likely to pander to the worst instincts of the public 
              instead of educating them. (Just count the number of news stories 
              about ghosts around Halloween or the predictions of psychics around 
              the new year.) Their sense of the public trust of journalism is 
              founded much more on an entertainment than an educational model, 
              and the trends in what gets reported and how it gets reported clearly 
              bear out their influence. Small wonder that serious science and 
              skeptical inquiry, which is the best thing the scientific method 
              has to teach us, get such short shrift. </font></p>

            <p></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Now 
              we get further into the media wasteland, where oases are harder 
              to find. Scientists tend to focus on and hear about these oases, 
              such as the Stardate and Earth & Sky radio programs, the NOVA television 
              series on PBS, the new telecourse on astronomy from Coast Community 
              College, an occasional special somewhere on a cable channel, etc. 
              The most successful astronomy TV program was Cosmos, estimated to 
              have been seen by 500 million people in more than 60 countries since 
              1980. But all these are merely exceptions to the general rule of 
              what is seen on television on an average night. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Overall, 
              the television picture is very dim indeed, with vast quantities 
              of pseudo-science being served up by most of the commercial networks. 
              (This is being exacerbated by the tremendous growth of what is called 
              "tabloid tv" &#151; shows that generally imitate the contents and 
              approach of the tabloid newspapers.) Science on many stations is 
              often limited to ten-second newsbites on the evening news that make 
              little sense to the uninitiated (and are often "Guinness Book of 
              World Records" stories &#151; the farthest galaxy, or the most massive 
              black hole.) </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As 
              a country, we need to recognize the enormous power that the media 
              have, and pay more attention to how decisions are made in the media. 
              By this I don't mean censorship, but rather undertaking a long-term 
              educational program to make sure that those who have the responsibility 
              for deciding what goes on the air (or what is printed) have the 
              education and the informed background to make sensible judgments. 
              One step would be to introduce and require excellent science overview 
              courses developed specifically for students going into journalism. 
              Another would be for everyone who is dissatisfied with science coverage 
              on the media to make his or her voice heard locally or nationally. 
              (In San Francisco, the work we have done at the ASP has increased 
              the amount of astronomy on local radio and television significantly 
              and, although it took a while, it was not a very painful exercise.) 
              </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The 
              argument the media always make in response to such concerns is that 
              they are merely giving the public what it wants. But this argument 
              is specious. Someone like me, who began life in Communist Eastern 
              Europe, never got to taste a mango or an avocado as a child. Thus 
              I would never have known to ask for a mango or an avocado, or have 
              realized that I might want one. But after we came to America, I 
              was introduced to a much wider range of foods: my palate was educated...and 
              now I ask for mango and avocado regularly. Similarly, I would suggest 
              that when the media tell us that people are much more interested 
              in the Bermuda triangle that the Great Attractor, they are merely 
              confessing our joint failure at educating both the gatekeepers of 
              the media and the public about the tasty treats real science has 
              to offer. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
              focusing so strongly on the entertainment aspect of their mission 
              over the educational aspect, the media lose sight of the fact that 
              there is an alternative to pandering to the lowest taste. It is 
              the far more difficult and long term job (and the almost forgotten 
              pleasure) of elevating the tastes and desires of their audience 
              to new levels of perception and understanding. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I 
              should mention that there is a national organization which is making 
              a creditable effort to help the media sort out science from fiction 
              science. The group is called the Committee for the Scientific Investigation 
              of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), a mouthful of a name, but 
              a group with their hearts in the right place. It consists of scientists, 
              educators, magicians, philosophers, lawyers, and other skeptics 
              whose interest is to get the rational, skeptical perspective about 
              fiction science out to the media and the public. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Through 
              their superb magazine, The Skeptical Inquirer, their meetings and 
              workshops, and their information releases to the media, CSICOP has 
              managed to alert and educate a significant number of reporters to 
              stop and consider what they are doing when they file a story involving 
              pseudoscience. They also work to bring together such reporters with 
              skeptical spokespeople before a story is written. (They can be contacted 
              at: P.O. Box 703, Amherst, NY 14226; I urge everyone in astronomy 
              education to get to know their work and support what they are doing.)
