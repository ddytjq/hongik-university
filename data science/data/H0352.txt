      <td width="515">Small molecule drugs are xenobiotics, foreign molecules, that the
        human body attempts to deal with through a number of responses.&nbsp; Some drugs are excreted from the human body
  intact.&nbsp; Most drugs, however, need to be modified structurally to facilitate
  excretion.&nbsp; These modification processes are called drug metabolism.&nbsp;
        Drug
  metabolism is a detoxification function the human body possesses to defend
  itself from environment hostility.&nbsp; When a person is sick, however, the body
  needs some kind of medication to fight the disease.&nbsp; Ideally, a drug should
  reach the site of action intact, cure the disease, and leave the body after it
  completes its mission.&nbsp; However, drug developers often face the dilemma that a
  potential drug is either metabolized/excreted from the body too fast, that the
  drug can not reach its therapeutic effect, or too slow, that it stays in the
  body for a long time, causing side effects.&nbsp; (Remember the drug is a xenobiotic
  that the normal human body doesn't need.)&nbsp; The study of drug metabolism,
  therefore, serves primarily two purposes: to elucidate the function and fate
  of the drug, and to manipulate the metabolic process of a potential drug.

  <p>The liver is the primary site for metabolism.&nbsp; Liver contains the necessary
  enzymes for metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics.&nbsp; These enzymes induce
  two metabolism pathways: Phase I (functionalization reactions) and Phase II
  (biosynthetic reactions) metabolism.&nbsp; Some typical examples of Phase I
  metabolism include oxidation and hydrolysis.&nbsp; The enzymes involved in Phase I
  reactions are primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum of the liver cell,
  they are called microsomal enzymes.&nbsp; Phase II metabolism involves the
  introduction of a hydrophilic endogenous species, such as glucuronic acid or
  sulfate, to the drug molecule.&nbsp; Enzymes involved in phase II reactions are
  mainly located in the cytosol, except glucuronidation enzyme, which is also a
  microsomal enzyme.</p>
  <p>Drugs are usually lipophilic substances (Oil-like) so they can pass plasma
  membranes and reach the site of action.&nbsp; Drug metabolism is basically a process that introduces hydrophilic
  functionailities onto the drug molecule to facilitate excretion.&nbsp; When the drug
  molecule is oxidized, hydrolyzed, or covalently attached to a hydrophilic
  species, the whole molecule becomes more hydrophilic, and is excreted more
  easily.&nbsp; Drugs often undergo both Phase I and II reactions before excretion.&nbsp;
  The Phase I reaction introduces a functional group such as a hydroxyl group
  onto the molecule, or exposes a preexisting functional group, and Phase II
  reaction connects this functional group to the endogenous species such as a
  glucuronic acid.&nbsp; The modified drug molecule may then be hydrophilic enough to be
  excreted.</p>
  <p>Although liver is the primary site for metabolism, virtually all tissue
  cells have some metabolic activities.&nbsp; Other organs having significant
  metabolic activities include the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and lungs.&nbsp;
  When a drug is administrated orally, it undergoes metabolism in the GI track and
  the liver before reaching systemic circulation.&nbsp; This process is called first-pass
  metabolism.&nbsp; First-pass metabolism limits the oral bioavailability of drugs,
  sometimes significantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <td width="515">Drugs are ultimately excreted from the body through various routes.&nbsp;
        The
kidney is the major organ for drug excretion.&nbsp; It excretes hydrophilic drug and
drug metabolites through glomerular filtration.&nbsp; Macromolecules such as proteins
are retained.&nbsp; Lipophilic drug molecules are not directly excreted from the kidney.&nbsp;
        Only after they are metabolized into more hydrophilic molecules,
        can they be excreted through the kidneys into the urine.&nbsp; Drugs and their metabolites are also
excreted into bile.&nbsp; This is usually mediated by protein transporters.&nbsp;
        Drugs and
their metabolites in bile are eventually released into the intestinal tract.&nbsp;
        The
drugs may be reabsorbed into the body from the intestine.&nbsp; Drug metabolites such
as glucuronide conjugates, may be converted back to the parent drug in the intestine
through glucuronidase enzyme, and then reabsorbed into systemic circulation.&nbsp;
        This drug recycling process is called enterohepatic recycling.&nbsp; This process, if
extensive, may prolong the half-life of the drug.&nbsp; The bile drugs and drug
metabolites, if not reabsorbed by intestine, are excreted from the body through
feces.&nbsp; Also, a variety of orally administrated drugs are excreted through
feces because they are not absorbed through the intestine.&nbsp; Oral bioavailability
constitutes a major challenge for drug developers.&nbsp; Other routes of excretion,
such as sweat, tears, and saliva, are quantitatively less important. Excretion
through breast milk is not important to the mother, but may be of key importance
to the baby, because the drug may be toxic to the baby.&nbsp; Pulmonary excretion is
important for anesthetic gases and vapor drugs.

<p>As is pointed out, small molecule drugs are usually lipophilic substances
that can penetrate cell membranes to reach the site of action, and drug
metabolism is a process of introducing hydrophilic functional groups onto the
drug molecule.&nbsp; The most common phase I reactions are oxidative processes that
involve cytochrome P450 enzymes.&nbsp; These enzymes are a super family of proteins
found in all living organisms.&nbsp; These enzymes catalyze the following reactions:
aromatic hydroxylation; aliphatic hydroxylation; N-, O-, and S-dealkylation;
N-hydroxylation; N-oxidation; sulfoxidation; deamination; and dehalogenation.</p>
<p>These enzymes are also involved in a number of reductive reactions, generally
under oxygen-deficiency condition.&nbsp; Hydrolysis is also observed for a wide
variety of drugs. The enzymes involved in hydrolysis are esterases, amidases,
and proteases. These reactions generate hydroxyl or amine groups, which are
suitable for phase II conjugation.</p>
<p>Phase II conjugation introduces hydrophilic functionalities such as
glucuronic acid, sulfate, glycine, or acetyl group onto the drug or drug
metabolite molecules.&nbsp; These reactions are catalyzed by a group of enzymes called
transferases.&nbsp; Most trasferases are located in cytosol, except the one
facilitates glucuronidation, which is a microsomal enzyme.&nbsp; This enzyme, called
uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGTs), catalyzes the most important
phase II reaction: glucuronidation.&nbsp; Glucuronic acid contains a number of
hydroxyl groups and one carboxylic acid functionality.&nbsp; This molecule is
extremely hydrophilic, and improves the hydrophilicity of a drug molecule when
they are covalently bound.</p>

<p> In reality, drug metabolism is an extremely complicated
process, and the picture can be very messy. Often, a drug is metabolized into
many products, some major, others minor. A complete picture of the metabolism of
a drug is, in many cases, not possible, and not usually necessary.</p>
