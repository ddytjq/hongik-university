      <P><B>What is BeaveRun MotorSports ComPlex?</B></P>

      <P>BeaveRun is a motorsports complex designed especially for
      sports car racing, motorcycle racing, karting activities, autocrossing,
      product testing, and street and race driver training.  In summary,
      it has been designed to provide a place for all types of motor
      vehicle experiences.  It lies on almost 400 acres of land in
      Western Pennsylvania.  When fully completed, it will have almost
      four miles of a paved road course that can be run in five different
      configurations, a 8/10 mile paved training/karting track, a 400
      foot diameter skid pad and a vehicle dynamics testing area consisting
      of more than six acres of open pavement.  It will have timing
      and scoring and classroom facilities, restrooms and showers as
      well as an administration building and a clubhouse with food
      service, and a lounge with a large screen TV.  A karting shop
      will also be constructed at BeaveRun. </P>

      <P><B>What type of activities will take place at BeaveRun?</B></P>

      <P>BeaveRun will host as many different activities as you could
      imagine in the area of motor vehicles.  It will have a variety
      of driver schools and racing schools. You will see a broad cross-section
      of racing, from top of the line amateur sports car races, to
      vintage car races, motorcycle races, karting races and competitive
      autocross races.  Many clubs, such as the Sports Car Club of
      America, Porsche Club, the Mercedes Benz Club, the BMW Club,
      Viper Club, Camaro Club, Audi Club have reserved time in the
      summer of 2002.  In addition, look for vintage cars from all
      over North America at BeaveRun in mid-July, as they tune up for
      the Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix.  You will also see a great
      deal of race driver training as well as street driver training
      for both cars and motorcycles as well as karts.  We will have
      an active teen driver program.  Testing will be conducted for
      everything from street tires to new racecar designs</P>

      <P><B>When will BeaveRun be open for business?</B></P>

      <P>The first phase of BeaveRun will be open for business in early
      summer 2002.  The first phase will include the north road course
      (1.6 miles), the training/karting track, the skid pad and the
      vehicle dynamics testing area.  Buildings in the first phase
      include timing and scoring facilities, a classroom, restrooms
      and showers, a karting shop and an administration building. We
      plan to have the second phase, consisting of the remaining road
      courses, the clubhouse, an additional timing scoring building
      and the clubhouse open in the summer of 2003.<BR>
       <BR>
      <B>What is the status of construction at BeaveRun?</B></P>

      <P>The first phase land was cleared in the summer of 2001.  Excavation
      of the first phase began in December 2001.  Paving is scheduled
      to begin as soon as weather permits in the spring 2002.  We are
      pleased to have two very accomplished prime contractors working
      on BeaveRun.  Marucci &amp; Gaffney personnel have taken a special
      interest in excavation for the project.  They will be working
      throughout the winter to see that things are in place for paving
      in the spring.  IA Construction will complete the paving using
      a polymer formula especially designed for BeaveRun. <BR>
         <BR>
      <B>Who owns BeaveRun?</B></P>

      <P>BeaveRun MotorSports ComPlex is owned by a Pennsylvania limited
      partnership, Speed4U, L.P.  The general partner of Speed4U, L.P.,
      is PMPark, Inc.  PMPark owns a one percent interest in Speed4U.
       Limited partners own the remaining 99 percent interest in Speed4U.
       In that regard, Speed4U has been qualified to issue limited
      partnership interests by the United States Securities and Exchange
      Commission as well as several state securities agencies through
      a private placement memorandum.  Speed4U has entered into a management
      agreement with PMPark for management of BeaveRun at a fee of
      $2000 per month. <BR>
         <BR>
      <B>Why was a limited partnership chosen to own BeaveRun?</B></P>

      <P>As note above, Speed4U, L.P., which is a limited partnership,
      owns BeaveRun. A limited partnership was chosen to own BeaveRun
      for two main reasons.  One is because a limited partnership,
      unlike a corporation, is not a separate income tax paying entity.
      Thus, not only does Speed4U not pay income taxes, but also tax
      benefits that are often held in a corporation flow directly to
      the partners.  In addition, limited partners have no personal
      liability associated with the operation of BeaveRun.  Speed4U
      issues limited partnership units through a private placement
      memorandum.  We chose to use a private placement for the issuance
      of limited partnership units because of ease of issuance, and
      since it is a &quot;private&quot; placement, there are no sales
      commissions.  Thus, the investment goes directly to Speed4U to
      be used for development of BeaveRun.  In other words, nobody
      collects $200 for passing &quot;Go&quot;.</P>

      <P><B>How are you financing the development of BeaveRun?</B></P>

      <P>BeaveRun is financed in part with equity and in part with
      debt.  We estimate the cost of phase I to be about $6 Million.
       The whole project is budgeted to be about $9.7 Million.  We
      are financing the first phase with $4.4 Million in debt with
      the balance of the costs (about $1.6 Million) covered by equity
      contributed in part by the general partner, and in part by the
      issuance of limited partnership interests.  This ratio was chosen
      because it leverages the equity to maximizes the return to the
      limited partners. </P>

      <P><B>Do you have financing in place?</B></P>

      <P>Speed4U closed on construction and permanent financing through
      PenTrust Advisory Services, Inc., and the ERECT Fund in December
      2001.  A portion of the construction financing will be taken
      out by a SBA 504 loan arranged through the Regional Development
      Funding Corporation.  The loans have a one-year construction
      period with a ten-year permanent term and a twenty-year amortization.
       The interest rate throughout the term is fixed at about 9% </P>

      <P><B>Have you conducted any market analysis for operations at
      BeaveRun?</B></P>

      <P>Yes, Frost Motorsports, L.L.C., completed a market analysis
      in October 2001 for the operation of Phase I alone.  The analysis
      states in part that:  &quot;This facility is expected to be open
      by mid 2002 and is positioned to be a source of pride for the
      entire Western Pennsylvania area, . . ..  Many of the events
      scheduled for the facility will have regional and national significance,
      as well as strong corporate interest, which together, will provide
      a solid contribution to the area's economic growth.&quot;   The
      report also reflects a positive cash flow beginning in the first
      year of operations.  The report, which includes only phase I,
      projects net revenues before debt service to exceed $771,000
      during the second year of operation, with the net revenues increasing
      to over $935,000 by the fifth year.  </P>

      <P><B>Do you have an appraisal of BeaveRun?</B></P>

      <P>Yes, an appraisal/market valuation analysis for Phase I, alone,
      was completed by Cambridge Partners &amp; Associates as of September
      20, 2001, in accordance with appraisal standards established
      by the American Society of Appraisers, the Appraisal Institute,
      and USPAP.  The appraisal reports a &quot;going concern&quot;
      value equal to $6,200,000 and a real estate value of  $6,286,000.
       It also indicates cash flows and net revenues very similar to
      that shown by Frost Motorsports, L.L.C.  We are pleased with
      the results of these reports, especially since the appraised
      value for phase I exceeds our projected cost for development.
       The reports confirm the value of BeaveRun as we had anticipated.
      </P>

      <P><B>What is the BeaveRun Track Club?</B></P>

      <P>The BeaveRun Track Club is created to enable members to use
      the facilities at BeaveRun on a regular basis.  Weekly track
      time will be allocated to members of the Club.  In addition,
      exclusive weekend time will be available.  Members will also
      have use of the clubhouse, will receive discounts on fees for
      services and the cost of merchandise.  Finally, we plan to have
      friendly competition among members associated with timing on
      the road course, the karting/training track and autocross events.
       An annual banquet is planned.  </P>

      <P><B>Who is operating BeaveRun?</B></P>

      <P>The founders of BeaveRun are Thomas C. Wettach and Timothy
      W. Silbaugh.  They are the principal officers of PMPark, Inc.,
      the sole general partner of Speed4U, L.P.  Earl Seiler and Scot
      Silbaugh also have interests in PMPark, Inc.  Alan Wilson, of
      Wilson Motorsports, is the BeaveRun designer and continuing safety
      consultant.  Mike Rand is our part-time manager and Danny Yanda
      is also a consultant.  Earl Seiler is construction manager and
      Scot Silbaugh is operations manager.  Marketing and advertising
      are being handled by George Patterson, marketing manager.  Additionally,
      the Society of Automotive Engineers will be working with BeaveRun
      in administering training programs. </P>
