<BR><H4><U>Winter Solstice 1999</U>
<BR>
This is from Barbara Wolf of <A HREF="http://www.globalmeditations.com">GlobalMeditations.com</A>:
<BR>(I might add that this influence will be felt for about 6 months to a year astrologically, though of course stronger around the time of appearance...)
<BR><BR>
"The Solstice, December 22, 1999 is an important moment. 
Not only is it the longest night of the year (in the Northern 
Hemisphere), but, three other events happen.  1. The Solstice 
coincides with a Full Moon. 2. The moon is within a few hours of its 
perigee, its closest point to the Earth, which makes the Moon appear 
to be about 14% bigger than usual. 3. The Solstice is only ten days 
from the Earth's perihelion, its closest point to the Sun. 
<BR>Jim Fournier from <A HREF="http://www.geoman.com">Geoman.com</A> explains: "Since the Moon shines with reflected sunlight, then the moon will appear 7% brighter than usual. These events 
occurring together are extremely rare. This is probably the biggest, brightest moon of the Millennium as well as its last." 
<BR><BR>
Events in U.S.A. Eastern Standard Time:<BR>
Winter solstice is at 2:44 a.m., Dec. 22.<BR>
The moon is at perigee (221,614 miles from Earth), 5:55 a.m., Dec. 22.<BR>
Full moon is at 12:31 p.m., Dec. 22.<BR><BR>
Jim Fournier explains the Galactic Alignment with the Full Moon on the 
Solstice:<BR>
"The Full Moon on the Winter Solstice next week is like the sweep second
hand aligning with the minute and hour hand at midnight of a twenty-six
thousand year cycle. If there is one moment which represents the exact
fold point of the transition in our time this is it.
 <BR><BR>
This year the axis of the solstices is closely aligned with the line from here to the center of the Galaxy. Thus, on the Winter Solstice at
the turn of the Millennium, the center of the Galaxy is closely
aligned with the Sun. Not only that, because the Full Moon falls
precisely on the Winter Solstice, the line of the Earth, Sun and Moon,
as well as the plane defined by the Earth's axis with respect to the
ecliptic are all closely aligned with the direction to the center of
the Galaxy." <A HREF="http://www.gaiamind.org/solstice.htm">More info and a chart</A>. 
<BR><BR>
From Narada Moy, Phd, author of <A HREF="http://205.217.42.18/esoteric/tnsa.htm">Toward A New Scientific Astrology</A>:<BR><BR>
"I would point out as an astronomer, that our knowledge of the exact center of the galaxy is somewhat uncertain. Thus there is a few hundred years out of the 26,000 year cycle by which the exact alignment of winter solstice is also uncertain.
<BR><BR>
"As an astrologer, the influence of the full moon at winter solstice 1999 requires the examination of the position of the planets at that time as well as the galactocentric alignment. The full moon is located a 0 degrees 25 minutes Cancer. Mars is at 20 degrees Aquarius weakly conjunct Uranus at 14 degrees Aquarius, and strongly square to Venus at 19 degrees Scorpio.  This means that with the Galaxy conjunct the solstice in Capricorn. that the year, and the next 26,000 years will see the redefining of the Male-Female relationship and identity. <BR><BR>
"Men will become even more aloof and focus on freedom, love, and independence, and women on their visionary talents and selflessness.  This can lead to power struggles, but when they learn how to respect this cycle's differences for men and women, they will each be in their power. 
<BR><BR>"This doesn't seem like much of a change because this configuration has been prenoded by near alignment of the galaxy center with the zero point of Capricorn, and thus 'cuspyness' has been happening for nearly a century.  However, it will become extremely intense, especially this year.  Men will become more withdrawn, women more bitter. This has the result--when we learn to live with it--of a very powerful alliance. This alliance will truly bring in the Aquarian age of love, freedom, and communication.  The communication part--the Information Age influence--comes about because of the sextile of Mars with Mercury in Saggitarius.  The victory over the rift between the sexes will come about because men will want to open the dialogue with women over these issues. This resource (Venus semisextile to that Mercury) will help women to grow.  Men will open up to their feelings (the full moon) and express them to women. What a love fest!! The beginning of a new 26,000 year cycle of love (not just 2,000 years). The Aquarian planets and influence will be felt full term.
<BR><BR>"We must, however, deal with the misuses of love that precipitated the fall of Atlantis 1/2 cycle ago in 10,500 BC (Cayce's date for the fall of Atlantis). Karma created at the half cycle is reaped at the next half cycle. This has to do with genetic engineering, man-animal mixtures, ritual murder (and abortion?), war, racial hatred,  and hatred between the sexes--male and female bondage. An opportunity unparalleled for the last 12,000 years."
<BR><BR>
<H4><U>Nostradamus, From a message to king Henry II:</U><BR>
"Then the great empire of antichrist shall begin in the Attila, and Xerxes come down with an innumerable multitude of people, so that the coming of the Holy Ghost, proceeding from the 48th degree, shall transmigrate, driving away the abomination of the antichrist, who made war against the royal person of the great vicar of Jesus Christ and against His church, His Kingdom, and rein for a time, and to the end of time. And before this shall precede a solar eclipse, the most dark and obscure that was since the creation of the world, 'til the death and passion of Jesus Christ, and from Him until now. There shall be in the month of October, a great revolution made, such that everybody will think that the earth has lost its natural motion and has gone down into perpetual darkness."
<BR><BR>
If this refers to the October revolution ushering in Communism and the Soviet Union, what about the other references?  It is interesting that there was a great solar eclipse in 1917 on July 19 preceding that October revolution, and that it had 4 planets in Leo.  The July 19 date resonates with July 18, 1999 (date of a grand square with Leo involved) and also with the August 11, 1999 solar eclipse in Leo.  Was something started in October of 1999--perhaps a pre-revolution in Russia or in the US? (White Supremicist?--that would be really bad news. Will it come out in millennial terrorist acts?) Is it the Muslim fundamentalist revolution of the Taliban?<BR><BR>
<U>Nostradamus' s quatrain #69</U><BR> "In the year 1999 and seven months, from (or born of) the sky will come a great king of (or with) terror. He will bring back to life the great King of the Mongols. Before and after war (Mars) reigns happily.". <BR>
From: ELSA TUMBO (posted on an AOL message board)--<BR>
"Nostradamus died twenty years before Pope Gregory changed the existing Julian calendar by l0 days to increase its accuracy.   This modestly named Gregorian calendar  is still in use today.  It was instituted in Gregory's time in the month of October and it effectively changed the date October 5 to the l5th.  This calendar is still in use and it  makes August llth the same as July 31 (actually Aug 1, but the eclipse started Aug 10 for those in the US.)  in Nostradamus's time--just under  the wire."<BR><BR>
Perhaps Nostradamus was talking about the great earthquake in Istanbul, Turkey, which occurred about a day after the August 11th solar eclipse peaked over that very area. There are some who believe the alignment of the sun and moon during an eclipse can provide a small gravitational trigger for earthquakes, but this is not the concensus among scientists.  Another interpretation might be JFK Jr. plunging from the sky with terror. The above-mentioned quatrain is also one of the purported 'Antichrist' quatrains relating to an Asian figure, and certainly the war on the Serbians reigned happily. One of the greatest world stresses right now is that Red China is threatening to invade Taiwan because it is about to declare its independence officially.  The US would consider invasion an event of the "gravest consequence".  China now has the neutron bomb and our intercontinental missile technology.

<H4><B>Was Nostradamus right? <FONT  COLOR=#852B95><FONT  COLOR=#0000D7>THE MILLENNIUM</FONT></FONT>--is it all it's cracked up to be?  Will we go down in war, famine, plague, natural disaster?   Is Saddam Hussein the oriental in the blue turban?  (On the square in Bagdad he <U>is</U> pictured wearing a blue cap.) Is Mullah Mohammed Omar, the Taliban leader, the figure? He wears a blue turban. Will Jesus come again? (Mary has been sighted with much greater frequency.) Or is it all just millennial fever?  Are we crossing into the Aquarian Age? Some things <U>can</U> be said.

<CENTER><FONT  COLOR=#EA0000>PREDICTIONS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY</FONT></CENTER>
<BR>
1. The use of the internet may spawn a new social order.  People on the internet may become so close to ones like them that they will call them 'THEIR FAMILY', and act as if they are .  Read <A HREF="http://empyreanquest.com/science/qpi.htm">THE QUANTUM PARTICLE INTERNET</A> by P. Stephen Petersen, <A HREF="http://empyreanquest.com/index.html">EMPYREAN QUEST PUBLISHERS</A>.  This CONTROVERSIAL book is a fantasy on a parallel world where the internet has secretly taken over half the populace, and they act like quantum particles. Scientists Halbert Zweistein (Albert you know who) and Stan Exciting (Neils Bohr) debate whether the particle people are human or not.  The non-connected scientists devise 'The Quantum Execution Experiment'  where death row inmates replace SCHROEDINGER'S CAT. In the near future we may understand the laws of retribution and grace. Hopefully it will not take such radical means.
<BR><BR>
2. THE TAI CHI may be recognized as a quantum symbol of the coming <FONT  COLOR=#EC0000>THEORY OF EVERYTHING</FONT>. It will be made mathematical.  Read the scientific work, <A HREF="http://empyreanquest.com/science/qtc.htm">THE QUANTUM TAI CHI </A> by P. Stephen Petersen, PhD. It is possible it will be generally accepted that each individual is responsible for creating the world they occupy? The magnetization of possibilities is one way of interpreting Quantum Theory, as this book indicates.
The 21st Century may eliminate the philosophy of 'victimhood', leading us to responsibility and integrity.
<BR><BR>
3. The political order may also be transformed to a PEACEFUL RELIGIOUS STATE, perhaps much in the way John R. Barker presents in his novel, <A HREF="http://empyreanquest.com/fiction/pain.htm">NOT WITHOUT PAIN</A>. The work is available FREE ONLINE (until January 1, 1998 only) at <A HREF="http://empyreanquest.com/index.html">EMPYREAN'S SITE</A>.  Ancient artifacts are discovered in Mexico, revealing an ancient spiritual path.
<BR><BR>
4. <FONT  COLOR=#D90702>THE FUSION OF SCIENCE AND RELIGION</FONT> or THE ADVANCE OF RELIGION BEYOND THE NEW SCIENCE.  Russian scientists several decades ago first measured an electromagnetic field wandering around a room after a person's death.  This demonstrates a kind of 'life' after death.  Since then, we have developed means of photographing the human aura.  A science of healing is unfolding around the interpretation of colored patterns around the human body.  UCLA now has a department studying <FONT  COLOR=#0000E1>KIRLIAN PHOTOGRAPHY</FONT>.  Life patterns of electromagnetic matrices remain when part of a leaf is cut off.  We will understand the fields involved in laying down the pattern for life in this century.  
<BR><BR>
Science will explore domains formerly thought to be for religion only.  We will understand the <FONT  COLOR=#0000E1>FIELDS OF THE BODY</FONT> and how they manifest the mystical experience of 'THE ONE'. We also will reorient our science around the LAW OF THE ONE, using it as the first principle from which all others, including holistic quantum theory, can be derived. 
<BR><BR>
5. There will be a TEMPTATION TO USE CLONING to continually create psychic copies of oneself.  This involves training up children physically just like oneself to have the same knowledge and emotional set.  They then train children, etc.  This path, if followed, will have the <FONT  COLOR=#DF1C00>DIRE CONSEQUENCE</FONT> of the loss of identity and uniqueness, as clones proliferate and lose their conditioning.
<BR><BR>
6. The ALTERNATIVE to a spiritual world is a society of ULTIMATE CONTROL, the controllers siphoning off the life force as in <A HREF="http://empyreanquest.com/fiction/scifi.htm">THE SYMMETRY OF THE JEI</A>, by Philip James.  This short novel is also available from EMPYREAN QUEST.

<BR><BR>
<CENTER><FONT  COLOR=#F20000>BIG CHANGE IN PROGRESS?</FONT></CENTER><BR>
A very significant change is likely in about 1998-2002, when the <FONT  COLOR=#0000E1>GALACTIC CENTER REACHES THE FIRST POINT OF CAPRICORN</FONT>.  This is the position of the sun at winter solstice, the beginning of the rising light of the sun in the northern hemisphere, and the beginning of the cycle. This happens every 25,800 years and is THE RETURN KARMA FOR THE FALL OF ATLANTIS (galactic center in Cancer, half a cycle back), if you believe Edgar Cayce's date for the fall (10,500 BC).  
<BR><BR>
This means we are in the time when we may <FONT  COLOR=#FB0F02>REDEEM THE KARMA OF THE MISUSE OF SCIENCE</FONT> in creating combinations of men and animals.  Particularly important, then, in the two centuries to come will be the outcome of our biological discoveries in the area of cloning and genetic manipulation.  WE MUST learn a REVERENCE FOR LIFE and the natural order or we may suffer the same fate as the ATLANTEANS.  <BR><BR>
