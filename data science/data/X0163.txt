<CENTER><P><B><I>I had a Lady Email me one Day and she asked me what the
values of the Bull is worth. So I&nbsp;talked to her and explained it,
She Mentioned to me that NO ONE online of all the dart sites that she visited
had any explantions on the values of the Dart Board. So this gave me a
idea lets place one here at The Dart Connection, Yes many people come here
already know about the Dart Board BUT there are a few people that do not
know the values of the dart board. So I found a fair sized board online
and did a little editing to the board and now it is ready to go online
for the people that can use this info to help them learn and enjoy the
Awesome game of darts. And also to let you know that your suggestions do
not go in one ear and out the other I do listen and try to help as much
as I can. So Special thanks to GabbyDoll of Florida for her suggestion.
And if you have any suggestions or links anything that you think would
be good for The Dart Connection Please feel free to email me and I will
get back to you as soon as i can. Thanks and enjoy all. Happy Darting..
