        <p><b>Making sense of music on the internet can be a daunting task: do you buy CDs or download MP3s, where is that website that caters for your taste, how do you filter down the vast amount of information when searching for music. Personally, I don't want to see 1438 links to Britney Spears when I am searching for Burning Spear!</b></p> 
        
        <P><b>Where to Start</b></p>
        
		<p>One of the main problems you first encounter when looking for music on the web is the sheer volume of websites. In the golden days of 'old media', the BBC's Radio One was the place to find out about new music. After a brief spell as a relatively un-cool and out of date station the beeb sacked or relegated the 'old-school' DJs (remember 'wacky' Steve Wright) and re-invented itself with a selection of underground radio talent, largely poached from other stations! Today, Radio One provides a strong cross section of mainstream and alternative music, reflected in it's website<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk"> www.bbc.co.uk/radio1</a>. This is a great place to start searching for music: simply pick the DJ who best suits your musical taste and check out various web links to labels, artists and information from their Radio One home page. However, some of these allegedly cutting edge radio celebrities are more up on new technology than others!</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.linkdup.com">www.linkdup.com</a> provides a comprehensive database of music links (among other things). Searching for 'music' in their global search will generate a list of artists, labels, festivals, portals, media, nightlife, accessories etc and covers some diverse independent and mainstream topics.</P>

		<p>For all you musical anoraks out there, try pitching your knowledge against the awesome musical database that is the "All Music Guide" <a href="http://www.allmusic.com">www.allmusic.com.</a> This has to be the ultimate source of music information on the web. Type in the artist you are looking for and you will get comprehensive information about your chosen music idol, their discography, who they have worked with and what colour underpants they were wearing at their first gig!</p>

		<p><b>Back to the Mainstream</b></p>
		
		<p>There is no question that mainstream music on the web is massive. Currently the majority of people are buying CDs but digital downloads are becoming increasingly popular. A survey by International Data Corp <a href="http://www.idc.com">(www.idc.com)</a> found that use of music downloads is by far the heaviest among individuals under age 20. Over 77% of respondents under the age of 20 said that someone in their household has downloaded songs off the Internet. So where do you go to buy the latest Robbie Williams CD or download Barenaked Ladies?</P>

		<p><a href="http://www.cdnow.com">www.cdnow.com</a>, <a href="http://www.mp3.com">www.mp3.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.music.com">www.music.com</a> are all similar and competing sites offering music, news, videos, etc. CDnow obviously focuses on 'e-tailing' CDs and mp3.com on digital download so the choice may just come down to which format you prefer. Other notable mainstream music sites include <a href="http://www.mtv.com">www.mtv.com</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk">www.amazon.co.uk</a> which is trying to build on it's success in the on-line book market by including an impressive music 'channel' as well.</p> 

		<p>For those who like to be one step ahead of your mates with musical discoveries check out <a href="http://www.peoplesound.com">www.peoplesound.com</a>, which brands itself as "the definitive source of great new music online". Equipped with a search engine that will match new (and often unsigned) bands to the type of music you like, this is a fantastic way of becoming the A&R expert among your friends.</P>

		<p><b>Flash New Sites</b></p>

		<p>Finally, if you like your music sites to look as well as sound cutting edge there are plenty of artist sites to engage your mouse skills while you search for their music. You can easily lose an hour on the very fresh <a href="http://www.ronisize.com">www.ronisize.com</a> (Mercury Prize winner 1997) but, as with most of these sites, you will need to download flash or real player. <a href="http://www.djvadim.com">www.djvadim.com</a> takes on-line musical interactivity to the next level with the facility to mix sounds by clicking on various graphic areas. Last but not least <A HREF="http://www.xynetwork.com">www.xynetwork.com</A> is apparently where the best producers in the world bring the future of radio to anyone with internet or WAP phone on any network. I wonder if Radio One will be playing catch up again?</p>
