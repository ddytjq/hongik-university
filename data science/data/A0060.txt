<p><b><u>A Service of Quality</u></b></p>

<p>We place paramount importance on customer service and aim to meet your expectations on every occasion.</p>

<p>To achieve this aim we need accurate personal information about you. Please help us take prompt and efficient action by informing us of any changes to your personal circumstances either by visiting your Branch, calling Phoneline (24 hours a day) or by writing to us.  We have a legal obligation under the Data Protection Act to
ensure that all information held and processed about you complies with the principles of the Act.</p>

<p>The Act requires all personal information to be treated in the strictest confidence and to be used only for purposes of which you are aware.</p>

<p><b><u>Confidentiality</u></b></p>

<p>We will treat all your personal information as private and confidential (even when you are no longer a customer).  Nothing about your accounts nor your name and address will be disclosed to anyone, other than in four exceptional cases permitted by law.  These are:</p>

<p><ul><li>where we are legally compelled to do so;</li> 
<li>where there is a duty to the public to disclose;</li>
<li>where disclosure is required to protect our interest;
<br>(This will not be used as a reason for disclosing information
about you or your accounts, including your name and address, to
anyone else for marketing purposes.)</li>
<li>where disclosure is made at your request or with your consent.<br>
(This can be either as a result of an application for a product or
service or by signing an explicit declaration as part of the

other insurance proposals and insurance claims, for you and
