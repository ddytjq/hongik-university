Thermal Radiation</font></u>
<p>
Any object that is hot gives off light known as 
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/light/radiation.html">
Thermal Radiation</a> (or sometimes Blackbody Radiation for arcane physical 
reasons).  The hotter an object is, the more light it emits. And, as the
temperature of the object increase, it emits most of its light at higher
and higher energies. (Higher energy light means shorter wavelength light.)
The relationship between the amount of light emitted, its wavelength and its
temperature is an equation known as the <i>Planck Law</i>,named after 
the German physicist Max Planck, who first discovered it. For a hot object
at a given temperature, T, the equation gives the amount of light emitted at
each wavelength. A plot of the Planck Law has a characteristic shape:
<p> <center><img src="./images/physics/bb_spec.gif"></center><p>

The peak wavelength of the curve is given by the formula:<p>

<center><img src="./images/physics/lambda_max2.gif"></center><p>

with wavelength in angstroms (&Aring;) and temperature in degrees Kelvin.
Here is a Java 
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/light/planck.html">
Thermal Radiation Experiment</a> which will allow you to determine the 
relationship between temperature and wavelength.  The table below shows 
some astronomical objects, their normal temperatures, and the wavelengths
where they emit the most light.

If you add up the light energy emitted at all wavelengths, you get the total 
radiant energy from the object, called the <i>Luminosity</i> in Astronomy.
The luminosity of an object depends very sensitively on temperature and 
also on size (surface area), so that:<p>

where R is the radius of the body and T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin.

<i>Not to scale</i>.</TD>

Physics at the microscopic (atomic) level is very different and seemingly
very strange for those of us accustomed to the world on millimeter--kilometer
scales.  In our discussion, we'll employ a very simplified atomic model 
proposed in 1915 by Danish Nobel Laureate, Neils Bohr. This is called the 
"planetary atom" or 
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/light/bohr.html">
Bohr Model</a>. In this view, the atom consists of a nucleus, composed
of protons and neutrons, with electrons orbiting around the nucleus, like
a miniature solar-system. The electrical attraction between the protons
and electrons holds the atom together. The typical size of an atomic 
nucleus is 10<sup>-13</sup>cm with the  electrons orbiting at a radius of 
about 10<sup>-8</sup>cm (1&Aring;). A 
<a href="http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~dauger/orbitals/">
realistic picture </a>of atomic structure can be found at this UCLA site.

When scientists began probing the structure of the atom in the late 1800's
and early 1900's, they discovered
an amazing thing. The standard rules of Physics, set forth by Isaac
Newton, don't work at the atomic scale. Newtonian mechanics cannot
correctly describe the behavior of protons, neutrons, electrons or atoms.
Bohr, Planck, Pauli and other physicists (yes, including Einstein) began to 
develop a new set of physical "laws" that they demonstrated apply to the 
microscopic world of atoms.
This new theory was called "Quantum Mechanics".

<ol>
<li>Physical characteristics at the atomic level are <I>quantized</I>; which
means they can have only certain, discrete values.  For example, the 
energies available to an atom are limited to specific amounts. Consequently,
in the Bohr Model, this means that only certain orbits are allowed for the 
electrons. So, in a hydrogen atom, the first (lowest) energy state has an  
orbit with a radius of about 0.5 &Aring;; the next permitted orbit (energy)
has a radius of about 2 &Aring;, and so on.  No intermediate orbits or 
energies are allowed. 

<li>Only one particle can occupy a particular state at any one time. This
is the called the <i>Pauli Exclusion Principle</i>, after Wolfgang Pauli.
For example, in the first allowed atomic orbit only two electrons are
allowed, one spinning clockwise and one spinning counterclockwise

<li>Light, protons, electrons and other particles exhibit both wave-like and 
particle-like behaviours.  This is called the <i>Wave-Particle Duality</i>.

<li>The Universe is <i>probabilistic</i> rather than <i>deterministic</i>.
This means that, even if we know everything that there is to know about an
atom or other system, we cannot predict exactly what it is going to do
next.  The laws of physics can only assign "probabilities" or likelihoods
for specific behaviours.  
</ol>

The quantization of atomic energy levels (1) and the Pauli Exclusion Principle
(2) are responsible for the 
<a href="http://tqd.advanced.org/2690/ptable/ptable.html">Periodic Table</a>
of the elements.
<p>
The energies available to an atom depend directly on the electrical force 
between the nucleus and the electrons.  The difference in energy between 
levels corresponds to a specific wavelength of light. When the atom
encounters a photon of this specific wavelength, the photon will be
absorbed by the atom, and the electron will jump from the lower energy
level to the higher one. When the electron falls back down to its original
state, the atom emits a photon of this same specific wavelength (or possibly 
of another wavelength from a specific set of allowed wavelengths/energies). 
So, only certain photons can be absorbed or emitted by an atom. The simplest 
atom is, of course, hydrogen with a single nuclear proton and a single 
electron.

Einstein's puzzled appearance in the image at the top of the page alludes to 
his discomfort with the rules of Quantum Mechanics, particularly the 
probabilistic nature of physics.  Einstein is quoted as stating: <i>"God
does not roll dice!"</i> But, to our best ability to determine,  it seems 
clear that <i>"She does!"</i>.
