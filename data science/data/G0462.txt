<h1>Drawing a line of simultaneity</h1>
<i>AKA: why they tilt when you go faster</i>
<p>
This works out better if you draw it out on graph paper.  Okay, first draw
a diagram relative to you.  You've got your worldline as a vertical thick
line on the y-axis.  Pick a point on that worldline and call it event A.
Pick a point later on the worldline and call it event B (don't make them
too far apart or you'll need a large piece of paper!).  Now draw the light
cones for both events---don't worry!  The light cone for event A is just
two light rays, y = x and y = -x, that come out and up from point A.  The
light cone for event B---well, we kinda only want the light cone going
back in time.  This just means draw the same two light rays y = x and y =
-x coming out and down from point B.  It makes a nice diamond shape.
Where the two light cones cross, label those points C and D.  The line of
simultaneity is just the line through C and D.

Okay, now ya get to do a this for a moving observer.  Heh heh!  It's
pretty much the same technique.  First draw a diagram relative to you,
just like before.  Now say I zip by you at a fraction of the speed of
light.  On the same diagram draw my worldline at an angle from the
verticle (an angle less than 45&#176, rem'ber) and crossing your worldline
at
some point.  Now you're going to draw a light cone for my worldline.  Pick
any point on my worldline and call it event A.  Pick another point further
along my worldline and call it event B.  Draw the light cone for event
A---just those same 45&#176 lines!  Draw the light cone going back in time
for event B---again, same as last time.  You'll notice that it doesn't
make the square you got when you drew the box for your worldline; instead,
it's a rectangle.  Label the intersection points of the two light cones as
C and D.  Just like before the line through C and D is my line of
simultaneity.  See: it's tilted!

Okay, basic rundown of the worldline.  When I draw a spacetime diagram, I
must consider relative to whom I'm drawing it.  Each spacetime diagram has
a reference frame.  In this case lets say I draw a diagram relative to me.
My worldline is straight and is the y-axis (since I can't move away from
myself).  My lines of simultaneity are horizontal lines (since I'm staying
still relative to myself).  My lines of simultaneity are based off of my
worldline.  The line is a bunch of events that are simultaneous to me at
any given time.  If you were standing next to me, your worldline would be
a thick line a certain distance away from mine and your lines of
simultaneity would be the same horizontal lines, but your lines of
simultaneity would be based off of only your worldline.  It would have
nothing to do with the fact that I'm standing next to you and my lines of
simultaneity happen to be horizontal.
<p>
Saying the lines of simultaneity "angle off the space axis" is confusing!
Don't think of them as connected somehow with the space axis.  It's like
back in algebra: a horizontal line looks like it's got something to do
with the x-axis, but it's really a line of constant y.  Each horizontal
line for me is a collection of events (points, that is) that I see as
happening at t = n.  Ah, there's the snag.  This was a tricky point in
class, so don't feel bad about being caught by it.  Different observers
can have different opinions about simultaneity and they can all be right.
I can look at two events and say they are simultaneous, and you can look
at the same two events and say that one happened before another.  For
instance take the diagram that is relative to you and has me moving past
you at a fraction of the speed of light.  Look at C and D for my
worldline--oh, I forgot to put them in...well, look at where they should
be.  It seems to me that C and D are simultaneous.  To you, however, D
happens before C.  Who's 'right'?  Well, depends on which reference frame
you're looking at, I guess.
<p>
Your guess that the tilting of the lines of simultaneity is a function of
speed is quite right!  It ties into the idea of time dialation at
relativistic speeds (at speeds which are fractions of the speed of light).
Time dialation happens at non-relativistic speeds, but it's so minute that
it's near to impossible to detect.  Near-light stuff is where all the fun
things happen!
