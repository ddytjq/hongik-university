<a name="HH"><b>Herbig-Haro Object</b></a>, <b>HH Object</b>:<br>
Small emission nebulae with high velocities (several 100 km/s), formed by bow
shocks when fast-flowing jets of ejected material from a young star collides 
with interstellar matter. The matter is typically ejected along the rotation 
axis of the young star, and the emission occurs from recombination of ions
behind the bow shock. 
They are named for American astronomer George Howard Herbig (1920-)
and Mexican astronomer Guillermo Haro (1913-88).

<a name="liner"><b>LINER</b></a>, Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission Region:<br>
Galactic nucleus with a characteristic emission line spectrum, dominated by 
low-ionization states (O II, N II, S II) and only weak emission lines from
higher-ionization states (He II, O III, N III). The spectrum indicates 
Seyfert-like activity in the nucleus, probably not related to stars, but either
the massive central object in the nucleus, or shock waves generated by 
supernovae; the observed linewidths are similar to those observed in
<a href="#seyfert">Seyfert galaxies</a> and indicate rapid motion
(Spectra as Seyfert 2, except for stronger low-ionization lines). 
Like Seyfert nuclei, LINERs are more abundant in disk galaxies (spirals and 
lenticulars) of early types S0, Sa, and Sb than in other types, but much
more common.

<a name="pec_g"><b>Peculiar Galaxy</b></a>:<br>
<p>

<a name="planetar" href="../../planetar.html"><b>Planetary Nebula</b></a>:<br>
Gaseous nebula ejected by a sunlike star at the end of its nuclear life,
before becoming a White Dwarf star. Named so because they reminded William 
Herschel to the appearance of planet Uranus. Planetary Nebulae are 
short-living objects and dissipate into space in a few 10,000s of years.
<p>


<a name="pop"><b>Population, Stellar:</b></a><br>
Various regions in galaxies are composed of different populations of stars:
Young stars of second or third generation, enriched with heavy elements
gained from earlier generation stars, form <i>population I</i> which is
usually found in the disks and spiral arms of galaxies. Old stars of the
first generation, <i>populatiion II</i> are typically located in the core
and halo of galaxies. Elliptical galaxies are often made totally of
population II stars, irregulars like the Magellanic Clouds of pure
population I.
<p>

<a name="pulsar"><b>Pulsar</b></a>:<br>
Regularly pulsating radio sources, with periods of order seconds or less. 
They are actually fastly neutron stars with a hot spot, which emits radiation
in a cone as the star rotates, and are observable if Earth and our solar 
system happens lie within thy cone.

<h3><a name="R">R</a></h3>

<a name="refl_neb"><b>Reflection Nebula</b></a>:<br>

<h3><a name="S">S</a></h3>

<a name="s0"><b>S0 Galaxy</b></a>:<br>
other name for <a href="#lenticul">Lenticular Galaxy</a>
<p>

<a name="seyfert"><b>Seyfert Galaxy</b></a>:<br>
Galaxies (mostly spiral) with extremely bright small nuclei which show
broad emission lines in their spectra. In Type I Seyfert galaxies,
permitted lines have bright cores which are as broad as forbidden
lines, and very wide wings indicating velocities of 5,000 to 10,000 km/s.
In type II Seyfert galaxies, these wings are absent and lines are Doppler
broadened corresponding to velocities of 500 km/s; type II Seyferts are
often strong and variable X ray sources. 
The brightest Seyfert galaxy, of type II, is 
<a href="../../m/m077.html">M77</a>.

<p>

<a name="spir" href="../../spir.html"><b>Spiral Galaxy</b></a>:<br>
<p>

<a name="star_cl" href="../../cluster.html"><b>Star Cluster</b></a>:<br>
A group of stars, bound together by their mutual gravity, occupying a
certain volume of space and showing common proper motion. Presumably the
stars of a cluster have formed together at about the same time and within
the same area of space from a <a href="#diffuse">diffuse nebula</a>. Their
<a href="#hrd">HRD</a>'s are thus isochrones (lines, surfaces or states of
<i>constant time</i>) of stellar evolution. One distinguishes 
<a href="#open">open</a> and <a href="#glob">globular</a> star clusters. 
<p>

<a name="st_cloud"><b>Star Cloud</b></a>:<br>
<p>

<a name="starburst"><b>Starburst Galaxy</b></a>:<br>
A galaxy which experiences a current, or has experienced a recent burst, or 
outburst, of star formation, with star formation rates of up to about 100 
times the normal rate. Consequently, starbursts produce large numbers of young
stars, including high mass stars of spectral types O and B.  Frequently these 
stars are obscured by interstellar dust, which is heatened by their radiation
to a temperature of about 100 K, and therefore shines brightly in the infrared 
light.
Starbursts are probably triggered by gravitational perturbations in encounters 
with neighboring galaxies. 
The most prominent example of a Starburst galaxy is
<a href="../../m/m082.html">M82</a>.

<a name="st_ass"><b>Stellar Association</b></a>:<br>
<p>

<a name="supercl"><b>Supercluster</b></a> (of galaxies):<br>
<p>

<a name="sn"><b>Supernova (SN)</b></a>:<br>
Stellar explosion which causes a star to flash up rapidly (hours) to the 
brightness of a whole galaxy (up to absolute magnitudes of about -19 to -20),
to fade again slowly (over months) after some time.
The term "Supernova" was coined by Baade and Zwicky 1934.
Classification from spectral analysis as Type I (no H lines) and II (contains H),
where type I is further subdivided into Type Ia (spectrum contains Si lines),
Ib (no Si, but Helium), and Ic (no Si, no He). While all supernovae of all 3
subtypes of type I have similar light curves, the light curves of type II give 
rise to classification of subtypes IIL (linear decrease) and IIP (brightness 
stays on a constant plateau for some time), and peculiar light curves like that 
of SN 1987A. Rare subtypes of Type II are II-b  which has only little
hydrogene in spectrum, and type II-n which has narrow emission lines on
top of broad ones, and a slowly and lately declining light curve. There
are two causes for supernova explosions:
<ol>
<li><!1.> 
  The explosion of a massive star at the end of its life; these occurs only
  for young (<a href="#pop">population I</a>) stars, and thus in disk
  galaxies, and generates types Ib, Ic, and II supernovae; Ib supernovae
  occur if the progenitor has been stripped off (by stellar winds
  [Wolf-Rayet] or binary interaction) its H mantle layer, Ic if also the
  He layer has been removed.
<li><!2.>
  The explosion of a white dwarf as it acquires too much mass in a binary
  system (occur in all types of galaxies), supposed reason for type Ia.
</ol>
An older classification, proposed by Zwicky, also contained types III, IV and
V which are now obsolete, where types III and IV are now regarded as variations 
of type II, and type V probably not as supernovae at all. Only one SN has ever 
been classified as type IV, SN 1961 in NGC 3003, which had a unique light curve. 
Classified as type V have been <a href="../ngc/etacar.html">Eta Carina</a> and 
a SN in NGC 1058.
<p>

<a name="snr" href="../../snr.html"><b>Supernova Remnant (SNR)</b></a>:<br>
<p>

<a name="synch_neb"><b>Synchrotron Nebula</b></a>:<br>
Nebula emitting synchrotron radiation, i.e. radiation emitted by electrons 
accelerated in strong magnetic fields. Typically found in <a href="#snr">
supernova remnants</a> and cosmic jets.
<p>

<h3><a name="V">V</a></h3>

<a name="var"><b>Variable Star</b></a>:<br>
A star which varies notably in brightness. For some stars, this is caused by 
occultations in a binary system (eclipsing binaries) or rotation, while others
vary phyically by pulsation, cataclysmic events like explosions, or other 
reasons.
<p>
Strictly speaking, every star is physically variable over timescales of its 
evolution.
