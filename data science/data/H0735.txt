<h2>TB IS BACK--WITH A VENGEANCE!  <br>
HEALTH CARE WORKERS BEWARE!!</h2>
<h4>By Dr. Paul Schnee, Medical Officer of Health</h4>

<h3>The Worldwide Picture</h3>

In April 1993, the World Health Organization declared TB as a global emergency, the first declaration of its kind in WHO
history.  In 1995, TB killed nearly 3 million people, --more than AIDS, malaria, Ebola, plague and cholera combined.  In
the next ten years, TB will kill 30 million people.

1/3 of the world&#146;s population has been infected by TB!  Every second a person becomes infected with TB.  In the next
ten years, 300 million more people will become infected and 90 million will develop the disease.

<ul>
<li> <u>Europe</u> -- TB cases are increasing, especially in Eastern Europe and Russia.  In London, 2% of the city&#146;s homeless are sick and infectious from TB.
<li> <u>Asia</u> -- a multi-drug resistant TB time bomb is set to go off in Thailand, India and Pakistan.  40% of TB patients in some
regions of Pakistan are resistant to 3 or more TB drugs.  Up to 68% of health care workers in some hospitals in Thailand are infected with TB.
<li> <u>Africa</u> -- 40% of South Africa&#146;s people are infected with TB. Numerous health care workers in some African hospitals  have died of TB.  In some sub-Saharan African countries, TB rates have doubled in the last 10 years.

</ul>


<h3>The Deadly Duo  (TB &amp; HIV)</h3>

About 1.7 billion people (1/3 of the world&#146;s population) are infected with TB.  4 million people are infected with
HIV.  Since about 10% of infected people with normal immune systems eventually  develop TB, about 170 million of these
people will develop TB (10% of 1.7 billion).  However, HIV-infected people are far more likely to become infected with
TB and to subsequently develop clinical disease than people with normal immune systems.  It is estimated that HIV
infection will annually produce an additional 1.4 million active cases of TB.  Thus, HIV infection will greatly
magnify the global TB epidemic.  TB is already the leading cause of death amongst the HIV infected.

<h3>Drug-Resistant Strains</h3>

Ironically, TB control projects (badly managed) are the primary source of multi-drug resistant TB.  People who fail
to complete treatment regimens may remain infectious and transmit resistant organisms.  There is no cure for some
multi-drug resistant strains of TB.  Up to 50 million people may currently be infected with TB resistant to at least one
anti-TB drug.

<h3>Why Worry?  TB is &#147;Over There,&#148;  not here, isn&#146;t it?</h3>

True, most of the world&#146;s TB is &#147;over there,&#148; but due to international travel and immigration, TB is being brought
here.  Every country is threatened by the TB in other countries.  Since 1980,  more than 2 million people have
immigrated to Canada.  In 1994, 57% of cases of TB in Canada occurred in foreign-born people.  Some of this TB is drug-
resistant.  In 1994 in Edmonton, 81% of the new TB cases were found in recent immigrants (within the past five years)
from TB endemic countries, especially Asia.

<h3>TB in Children</h3>

TB is the leading single infectious cause of female deaths, killing over 1 million women every year.  Children bear the
brunt of their parents&#146; TB.  No other infectious disease creates as many orphans as TB.  In the US, the number of
children under age 15 sick with TB increased by 35% between 1985 and 1992.

<h3>Refugees</h3>

Half the world&#146;s refugees may be infected with TB. Conditions in refugee camps are ideal for the spread of TB.

And don&#146;t forget about our aboriginal people; they have a higher TB rate than immigrants!
The overall rate of TB in Canada was an all-time low of 7.0 per 100,000 people in 1993, but rose to 7.1 in 1994.
Alberta&#146;s TB rate was 5.8 in 1993 and rose to 6.6 in 1994.
The TB rate in the Yukon was 33.8 in 1994.  The TB rates in the NW Territories fluctuate from 40 to 100!

<h3>Who gets TB?</h3>

The major risk behavior for contracting TB is BREATHING!!  Anybody can become infected if sufficiently exposed to
Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  Once infected, an average of about 10% of people will develop active disease.  The
likelihood of becoming infected and of developing the disease depends upon a number of factors, primarily the
state of the person&#146;s immune system.

<h3>Persons most likely to be exposed</h3>
Health care workers are high on this list, along with inner city residents, residents of mental institutions, prisons
and nursing homes, foreign-born, aboriginal and elderly people and IV drug users.

<h3>Once exposed, who are most likely to develop the disease?</h3>
People with weak immune systems are at highest risk for developing the disease.  These include:
<ul>
<li> the very young and the very old 
<li> the HIV infected
<li> the immunosuppressed (eg. on corticosteroids or cyclosporin)
<li> the malnourished and homeless, alcoholics and drug abusers.
<li> workers exposed to silica dust (especially those with silicosis)
<li> the chronically ill (renal failure, diabetes, leukemia, lymphomas, malignancies, etc.)
</ul>


<h2>Health Care Workers Must Become More Suspicious of TB</h2>

<h3>What should we watch for?</h3>
Think TB if any of our patients (especially in the categories listed above) have cough and sputum (especially
if blood-tinged) for more than 1 month, fever for more than one week, malaise, fatigue, weight loss, night sweats or a
&#147;pneumonia&#148; that will not respond to treatment.

<h3>What should we health care workers do?</h3>
We must always be aware of the possibility of TB in every patient we care for, especially high risk patients mentioned
above.  We must establish TB control procedures in all of our health care service sites (including Doctor&#146;s offices).
We must personally support and cooperate with TB control procedures established in health care sites where we work.

<h3>Control of TB in the Region</h3>
National TB control guidelines will be available in April.  With the guidance of the regional communicable disease and
infection control committee, these guidelines will be implemented in the region in 1996,.

Physicians can contact Alberta Tuberculosis Services ( Dr. Anne Fanning and staff -- Phone 422-2444, Fax 422-5149) for
advice regarding TB.  The regional Medical Officer and the Public Health Nurses (with the guidance of TB services) are
also available to do the local contact tracing, tuberculin testing and ensuring that patients receive and take their
prophylactic and treatment medications. </p>
