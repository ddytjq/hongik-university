  <p> <b><img src="../../graphics/retscan3.jpg" width="150" height="99" align="left" hspace="10" alt="iris scan">Amsterdam 
    (6/17/02)-</b> Security systems that scan the iris of your eye may soon help 
    speed you through those long lines at the airport. </p>
  <p><font size="2"><b>Photo- Traveler using iris scan security system</b></font></p>
  <p>Following the September 11th disaster, there has been increased interest 
    in streamlining travel without sacrificing security. Iris recognition systems 
    would seem to fit the bill. Such systems are now in limited use at several 
    airports in Europe and the United States. These systems take advantage of 
    random variations in the visible features the iris, the colored ring around 
    the pupil. After a traveler has his iris scanned once, a unique file is placed 
    in a database. Subsequently, the traveler simply looks at a suitably equipped 
    camera that scans and checks the iris in little more than one second. </p>
  <p>Amsterdam Airport Schiphol began using its automated border passage system 
    in October 2001. That system combines iris recognition technology and an advanced 
    smart card. It is the first of its kind to use iris recognition to secure 
    border control. New enhancements to the system will extend its functions to 
    include ticketing, check in, screening and boarding. Schiphol will also use 
    an iris recognition system behind the scenes to provide secure access to restricted 
    areas. </p>
  <p>An iris recognition system is also being evaluated at London's Heathrow airport. 
    Frequent transatlantic travelers on British Airways and Virgin now use the 
    EyeTicket Jetstream system to speed them through passport control at the world's 
    busiest airport. The system is similar to that in use at Schiphol. A similar 
    system is in place in Germany's Frankfurt Airport. While the North American 
    experience has so far been limited to the small regional Charlotte Airport 
    in South Carolina, plans are now underway to install similar systems at JFK 
    in New York, Dulles in Washington, DC and at 14 international airports in 
    Canada. </p>

  <p>Iris scanning takes advantage of random variations in the visible features 
    the iris, the colored part of the eye. The iris consists largely of a system 
    of muscle that expand and contract the pupil in response to changing lighting 
    conditions. The details of each iris are phenotypically unique, that is, no 
    two are exactly alike, not even among twins, not even in your own two eyes. 
    The structure of the iris develops in the embryo, assuming its lifelong character 
    by the seventh or eighth month. Some color changes can occur in the first 
    months of life, which explains why some babies who are born with blue eyes 
    may end up with brown or some other color. </p>
  <p>After taking a picture of the eye, the system samples the radial and angular 
    variations of each individual iris to form an IrisCode, a digital file that 
    serves as a reference in database. At 512 bytes, the file is quite small, 
    since it is a hexadecimal code reference rather than an actual iris image. 
    Research confirms an extraordinarily high level of statistical reliability 
    for the system.</p>
  <p>A person using the system simply looks into a camera. The computer program 
    then locates the iris. Next, the system locates the iris' outer and inner 
    edges. The monochrome camera uses both visible and infrared (700-900nm) light. 
    The program maps segments of the iris into hundreds of vectors. Position, 
    orientation and spatial frequency provide the basis for calculation of the 
    IrisCode. The system also manages to take into account normal changes in the 
    eye. For example, the system compensates for papillary expansion and contraction. 
    It can also detect reflections from the cornea. </p>
  <p>Is there any way to fool the system? Researchers attempted to do this by 
    creating contact lenses with irides printed on them. The system had no trouble 
    spotting the fakes. Some of the newer drug treatments for glaucoma include 
    changes in iris pigmentation among their side effects. This should not be 
    a problem since iris recognition systems rely on monochrome images, the developers 
    say. </p>
  <p align="left">Iris recognition technology is finding its way into many aspects 
    of everyday life. England's Nationwide Building Society (a bank), for example, 
    replaced PIN numbers with iris recognition at its ATM machines in 1998. The 
    systems now form part of many building access systems in government and industry. 
    More recently, products have become available to screen computer network users 
    and to provide secure online transactions. Any application for which you currently 
    use a password could soon require a quick look at your eye instead. </p>

  <p><a href="http://www.melia.com/ngm/0204/feature0/"><img src="../../graphics/afghan.jpg" width="132" height="98" align="left" border="0" alt="nat geo link"></a>Iris 
    recognition systems are also finding unexpected applications. The best know 
    example involved using iris recognition to confirm the identification of a 
    mysterious young Afghan woman originally photographed by Nation Geographic 
    photographer Steve McCurry in 1984. Some 18 years later, McCurry photographed 
    Sharbat Gula in Afghanistan. At the behest of National Geographic, Dr. John 
    Daugman, developer of the iris recognition system, then compared the irides 
    in the photographs using his algorithms. He concluded that the eyes were a 
    match. </p>
