		<P>
		Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is a major economic and political initiative to create a single currency for all the European Union (EU) countries that wish to join.
		The Treaty of Maastricht covers political and economic considerations including the legal requirements for	joining EMU. The Treaty was signed by the member states in 1992. It amended the Treaty of Rome, which established the EU (then known as the European Economic Community or EEC) in 1957.
		One of the key provisions of the Treaty establishes a single European currency area where monetary policy is managed centrally by the European Central Bank. The euro is the name given to the single currency adopted by those countries participating in the final stage of EMU.

		<P>
		On 1st January 1999 Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain joined EMU in the "first wave" Three remaining members of the European Union (United Kingdom, Denmark	and Sweden) have decided not to join in the first wave but may join at a later stage.  Greece initially did not meet the criteria for membership as laid down by the European Central Bank but joined EMU in 2001. If other countries, such as Hungary, join an expanded European Union it is expected they will also seek to join the single currency.

		<P>
		The initial 11 countries, plus Greece, are following a timetable that was set out in the Maastricht Treaty:<BR>
		<B>Launch of the euro</B><BR>
		In January 1999 the euro was adopted as the currency of each of the 11 countries. At that
		point their existing national currencies became denominations of the euro, using a fixed exchange rate (or the "conversion rate" as it is officially known). <BR>
		<B>Transition </B><BR>
		 The period between January 1999  and 31 December 2001 is known as the Transition Period. While there
		are no euro banknotes or coins available at this stage businesses and individuals may use either the euro or their existing national currency for 'non-cash' payments.  By end of 2001 all accounting operations other than 	cash must convert to the euro.<BR>
		<B>Cash Changeover</B><BR>
		 euro notes and coins will be introduced on 1st January 2002 which marks the start of the Cash
		Changeover during which time the national currency will be withdrawn. The maximum period allowed for this is six months but most of the 12 countries are planning to complete the exercise in a much shorter period.

		<P>
		From the 1st January 1999:
		<UL>
		<LI>There has been  no exchange rate fluctuations between the currencies of EMU member countries
		<LI>Prices may be quoted in euros and the national currency. Thus price comparisons for goods from different countries become easier because they can be priced in euros across the Eurozone
		<LI>People can choose to hold bank accounts and make payments in euros or in their national currency
		<LI>Purchases in some places can be made in euros using cheque books or cards although euro notes and coin will not be available until 1st January 2002
		<LI>A single interest reference (base)  rate became common across the member countries
		</UL>

		From the 1st January 2002:
		<UL>
		<LI>Prices must be quoted in euro and pricing in national currencies will be quickly phased out
		<LI>National currency notes and coins will be withdrawn within two to three months
		<LI>Accounting will have to be undertaken in euro only.

		<P>
		The euro is the name of the single currency adopted by the EMU member countries. One euro is divided into 100 cents. The euro has been given the currency code of "EUR" and has the symbol €. You will see these becoming increasingly used, especially in the EMU member countries. They mean the same thing and can be used interchangeably.

		<P>
		Overall monetary policy is determined by the European Central Bank, whose primary objective is to maintain price stability within the euro area. The ECB, in conjunction with the National Central Banks of the participating countries, has operational responsibility for implementing euro monetary policy.

		<P>
		ECB is the abbreviation for the European Central Bank. Mr. Wim Duisenberg was appointed President of the ECB by EU leaders in 1998 for a term of up to 8 years.  The President chairs the Governing Council that has representatives from all EU member states, although some decisions regarding the euro can  be made only by Council members from participating countries (commonly referred to as the "Euro Club").
		<P>
		The ECB sets the reference (or base) interest rate for the whole of the euro area. The Governing Council of the ECB meets monthly to determine this rate according to economic conditions.

A Bank of Scotland credit card can be used to make purchases in euro or in the traditional currency. It can also be used to obtain cash from cash machines in the national currency now and in euro when the new banknotes are introduced. As for any foreign currency any euro payments made with your credit card will be converted to sterling. Your statement will show the sterling amount, the original currency value and the exchange rate used.

		<P>
		Businesses that are selling to, or buying from, Europe, either directly or through other mechanisms, have begun to see transactions quoted and settled in euros. The changeover from national currency to the euro in the eurozone is proceeding rather slowly but remember that these currencies are withdrawn in 2002. Some industries, such as agriculture and tourism, are likely to encounter the euro earlier than other sectors.
		If you have customers or suppliers in the eurozone a requirement to trade in euros could arise at any time. Transacting in euro involves  exchange rate risk and you will have to consider how to deal with the resulting exposure.

		<P>
		You cannot be forced to make or accept payments in euros but you may experience increased pressure from your eurozone trading partners to transact in euros. Depending on the strength of your trading relationship and		competitive position a decision to offer or accept only sterling prices may put business at risk.

		<P>
		Dealing in national currencies alongside the euro is straightforward. National currencies will exist until 2002 and are interchangeable with the euro. This means that you can maintain a national currency account or open a euro account as appropriate. For example, if you have a Bank of Scotland euro  currency account, any incoming payment  in a national currency can be converted to euro at the fixed rate, free of conversion commission. Information regarding the original currency amount and the conversion rates used will be provided for ease of reconciliation.

		<TD CLASS=body WIDTH=75%><B><A NAME="bank">Will I need a euro bank account?</A></B>
		<P>
		This depends on the number of euro payments you need to make or receive and you should discuss your requirements
		with your branch manager. If you expect to receive only a few euro payments it may be simpler to have them
		converted to sterling and applied to your sterling account. If you expect to make and  receive payments in euro
		on a regular basis a euro account can offer a convenient way to manage at least some of your exchange rate risk.
		<P>
		Bank of Scotland offers a euro denominated account, with the option of a euro cheque book to make euro payments in
		the UK.

		Interest rates in the eurozone are, at present, lower than UK interest rates.
		However, the cost of currency exchange and fluctuations in currency value may cancel out or significantly reduce
		any benefits of a lower interest rate. Normally, therefore, borrowing in a foreign currency should be considered
		only if you have an income stream in that currency with which to repay the debt. In this way foreign exchange
		rate risk can be avoided. You should also remember that euro and sterling interest rates may move over time
		and any initial advantage may be eroded or reversed.

		<P>
		Conversion to and from the euro and the participating country currencies must be undertaken according to strict
		guidelines specified by the European Commission.  These rules do not apply to conversion between sterling and
		euro while the UK is not an EMU member country. The basic rules are:
		<OL>
		<LI> Conversion rates are expressed to 6 significant figures (see table above). All six of these figures should be used
		when performing a conversion calculation.
		<LI>The use of inverse conversion rates is specifically prohibited.
		<LI>Conversion between two national currencies must be calculated via the euro as an intermediary step. During this
		first step of conversion, rounding of the intermediate amount is possible to no less than 3 decimal places. At the
		final stage of conversion the resultant figure can be rounded up or down to the nearest cent (for euro) or the nearest
		sub-unit of the national currency (e.g. centime for the French franc). If the result is exactly half way then the amount
		should be rounded up.

		<P>
		The Government decided that the UK would not join EMU in the first wave in 1999. The UK will only join after
		positive decisions by the Government, parliament and the people by way of a referendum. The Government has set
		out five economic tests which will have to be met before any decision to join can be taken. The Government has
		said that it will produce an assessment of the five economic tests early in the next parliament.
		Countries that choose to join at a later stage may not follow a similar timetable to those countries that joined in
		1999. The UK Government published in February 2000 a second Outline National Changeover Plan for the UK which gives
		more information about the practical steps that would be involved should the UK decide to join EMU. Copies of this
		document can be obtained from HM Treasury (contact phone number: 020 7270 4558) or can be downloaded from the Euro
		Preparation Unit website at <A HREF="http://www.euro.gov.uk" TARGET="_new">www.euro.gov.uk</A>

		<P>
		Whether the UK joins or not, some shops, particularly those in major tourist areas or near airports,
		may start to accept payment in euros as well as sterling. Remember though that transactions will not be possible
		in euro cash until euro notes and coins are introduced in the participating countries in January 2002.
		Whilst the UK remains outside EMU there will not be a legal obligation on retailers in the UK to accept euro
		payments.
		<P>
		Wholesale market activity undertaken within the City of London has adopted the use of euro in preference to
		traditional currencies for transactions in the currencies of the participating countries.
		<P>
		For some UK businesses the euro may mean disruption or even threat to their current activities, particularly
		where a business is involved in a supply chain with larger European based manufacturers who have expressed a
		wish to account, even within the UK, solely in euro.
		<P>
		Dealing in national currencies alongside the euro is straightforward. National currencies will exist until 2002
		and are interchangeable with the euro. This means that you can maintain a national currency account or open a
		euro account as appropriate. Any receipts or payments made in a national currency can be converted to euro at
		the fixed rate, free of conversion commission.
		<P>
		Information regarding the original currency, the value of receipts and the conversion rates used will be provided
		on statements for ease of reconciliation.
		<P>
		Bank of Scotland credit cards can be used to make purchases both in euros and the traditional currencies with
		dual pricing now beginning to appear in some participating countries. They can also be used in cash machines to
		withdraw traditional currencies (euro notes and coins will not be introduced until 2002).
		Anything you buy in euros will continue to be shown on your statement as the sterling equivalent.

		<P>
		Irrespective of the UK's final decision on whether or when to join EMU, Bank of Scotland has developed plans to
		ensure that we can provide a range of euro products and services to fully meet the needs of all our customers.
		Our plans assume a UK changeover timetable along the lines outlined below with a Transition period of up to two
		years. During the early part of this dual currency period we expect the euro to be used mainly in the financial
		markets and by businesses trading with Europe. In the later stages all businesses will gradually change over to
		euro operations.  Most consumers are expected to continue to use sterling until
		E-day.
		During the transitional period customers will be able to make or receive euro payments using their existing sterling accounts. Where a transaction originated in euro the account statement will show the amount in both sterling and euro.
		We will also carry out a conversion (to euro) of all our sterling accounts at the end of the transition period. This will be a major undertaking and we are already examining what would be the most effective way of achieving this.
		It would take UK banks up to three years to complete preparations for the provision of comprehensive euro
		banking services for personal and business customers. While plans are being drawn up, full-scale development
		will not proceed until there is a high degree of confidence that the UK will join the single currency and in
		the timescale for doing so.

The government has intimated that a decision on UK entry will only be taken after an assessment of the 5 economic tests and that this assessment will be undertaken within 2 years of the current Parliament i.e. by end of June 2003.
