<p><b>1. What is the Council for Biotechnology Information?</b></p>

<p>The Council for Biotechnology
Information (CBI) is a coalition of seven of the world’s leading biotechnology
companies and two trade associations. Its mission is to improve understanding
and acceptance of biotechnology by collecting balanced, science-based
information and communicating it through a variety of channels. CBI was founded
in April of 2000.</p>

<p><b>3. Where does CBI work?</b></p>

<p>CBI’s North American operations are headquartered in Washington, D.C., 
with offices in Mexico City and Toronto. CBI also has sister biotech organizations in
Africa, Australia/New Zealand, Brazil, the Caribbean, Europe and Japan.</p>

<p><b>4. What is biotechnology?</b></p>

<p>Plant biotechnology is a tool to make seeds with special qualities that can allow
farmers to grow plants that are more nutritious, more resistant to pests and more
productive. It is used to identify a special trait in one source, such as taste 
or hardiness, and incorporate that trait into a plant.</p>

<p>Plant biotechnology is part of a continuum &mdash; a refinement of genetic enhancement
techniques begun thousands of years ago with the domestication of wild plants.
A major step forward occurred when 19th century researchers learned how to crossbreed 
plants to add new traits such as color. This led to the development of hybrids a 
half-century ago &mdash; one of the great achievements of modern agriculture.</p>

<p>The tools of biotechnology allow researchers to achieve the same kind of 
genetic exchange, but more precisely &mdash; eliminating the need to crossbreed 
plants for several generations to breed in desired qualities and breed out 
those qualities that are unwanted.</p>

<p>While biotechnology takes traditional crossbreeding to a new, more 
precise (and more promising) level, the National Research Council said in a 
1989 report that “no conceptual distinction exists between genetic modification 
of plants and microorganisms by classical methods or by molecular techniques that 
modify DNA and transfer genes.”</p>

<p>In fact, the word “biotechnology” first appeared in print back in 1919.<sup>1</sup>

<p><b>5. What are some examples of biotech products that are now on the market?</b></p>

<p>The very first commercial biotechnology product ever created was synthetic 
insulin.<sup>2</sup> The product, which was approved by the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) in 1982,<sup>3</sup> provided people who suffer from diabetes
with a more plentiful, affordable source of this important protein that controls the 
body’s blood-sugar levels. Since 1982, 76 biotech medicines have been approved by the FDA.
They include medicines that treat cancer, heart disease, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, immune
system deficiencies and infections. Another 369 are being tested.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>Currently, about 40 biotech crops<sup>5</sup> have been approved for commercial use 
in the United States. Worldwide, soybeans, corn, cotton and canola accounted for more 
than 99 percent of biotechnology crops in 2001.<sup>6</sup> All of these crops provide 
agronomic (agricultural) benefits,which is why farmers have embraced this new technology.
Biotech crops have boosted yields, reduced spraying and helped protect the environment 
by conserving topsoil through reduced tilling, which has also saved fuel. A 2002 study 
by the National Center for Food and Agriculture Policy quantified the benefits.
For example, herbicide tolerant soybeans helped farmers reduce their annual costs by $15 an
acre, which totals $735 million across 49 million acres.<sup>7</sup> In 2002 in the 
United States, it’s expected that 74 percent of the soybean acres will be planted with 
biotech seeds.<sup>8</sup></p>

<p>The next wave of biotech crops in development will produce food that is more 
nutritious and healthful, including vegetable oils with increased levels of vitamin E and
reduced levels of saturated fats; and peanuts, wheat and rice with potential
allergens removed.</p>

<p>Plant biotechnology is also being used to develop functional foods, such as vaccines
delivered through bananas or potatoes, and tomatoes with increased lycopene,
which has been linked to reduced risk of prostate and digestive tract
cancer.</p>

<p><b>6. How widespread are these crops?</b></p>

<p>Since 1996, when biotech crops like corn and soybeans were first grown commercially,
the adoption of plant biotechnology has been rapid. In the United States in 2001, 
68 percent of all soybean acres, 69 percent of all cotton acres and 26 percent of 
all corn acres were planted with biotech varieties. New statistics from the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture say those percentages are continuing to grow in 2002, to 74 percent for 
soybeans, 71 percent for cotton and 32 percent for corn.<sup>9</sup></p>

<p>The adoption of biotechnology has also grown rapidly across the globe.
In 2001, worldwide plantings of biotech crops totaled 130 million acres &mdash; 
up 19 percent from 2000, according to the <a href="http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/reports/nassr/field/pcp-bbp/pspl0302.pdf" onclick="javascript:window.open('index.asp?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fusda%2Emannlib%2Ecornell%2Eedu%2Freports%2Fnassr%2Ffield%2Fpcp%2Dbbp%2Fpspl0302%2Epdf','','').focus();return false;">
International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA).<img src="html/images/spacer.gif" border="0" width="4"><img src="html/images/pdf.gif" border="0" width="20"></a>
That is more than 30 times the area planted in 1996. Biotech soybeans, corn,
cotton and canola accounted for more than 99 percent of worldwide biotechnology
crops in 2001. The level of global adoption varies by crop. In 2001, biotech plants
accounted for 46 percent of the global soybean crop, 20 percent of the cotton, 11 percent
of the canola and 7 percent of the corn, according to the ISAAA.</p>

<p><b>7. Are these products safe for me and my family?</b></p>

<p>Yes. Biotech foods on the market today are as safe as those developed through 
conventional breeding.<sup>10</sup> In the eight years since the first biotech food 
product came on the market (the FlavrSavr<sup>&reg;</sup> tomato in 1994), there hasn’t 
been a single documented case of an illness caused by biotech foods.<sup>11</sup>
Hundreds of studies have confirmed the safety of biotech crops and food,
including a 15-year, $64 million study by the European Commission that involved
more than 400 research teams on 81 projects. In October 2001, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) also renewed registration for Bt cotton and corn,
saying they pose no risks to health or the environment.</p>

<p>Scientific organizations and regulatory agencies around the world have confirmed 
the safety of biotech foods, including the United Nations’ World Health Organization (WHO) 
and Food and Agriculture Organization, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society of
London, national academies in China, Brazil, India and Mexico, and other
international scientific groups. More than 3,300 scientists, including three
Nobel Prize winners, have signed a statement in support of biotechnology.</p>

<p><b>8. Can a biotech food contain a gene to which I’m allergic?</b></p>

<p>Ensuring that biotech foods don’t trigger allergies is an important part of the 
regulatory approval process. Since about 90 percent of food allergies are caused 
by a handful of foods,<sup>12</sup> the potential for causing allergies can be easily 
reduced by not using genetic material from these products. In addition, any genetic 
material that is used is carefully studied to see if it has anything in common with 
known allergens. Then, once it’s inserted into a plant, the plant is further studied 
to see if new allergens are created.</p>

<p>Other research is underway to use biotechnology to <i>remove</i> allergens
from foods such as peanuts and wheat.<sup>13</sup></p>

<p>“Biotechnology probably offers the only hope to allergic consumers that the crops 
they’re sensitive to might someday safely be incorporated into their diets,” said 
Steven Taylor, director of the Food Processing Center at the University of Nebraska 
and a co-director of the Food Allergy Research and Resource Program.<sup>14</sup></p>

<p><b>9. Who ensures the safety of biotech foods?</b></p>

<p>In the United States, the safety of biotech food is overseen by three 
separate agencies:</p>
<ul>

<li>The Food and Drug Association (FDA) assesses the safety of
all foods and animal feeds, including those produced through plant
biotechnology.</li><br>&nbsp;

<li>The Department of Agriculture (USDA), through its Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service, oversees field testing of biotech seeds
and plants to make sure their release causes no harm to the environment,
especially native plants.<sup>15</sup></li><br>&nbsp;

<li>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) evaluates
biotech plants’ environmental safety such as their pesticide properties,
possible effect on wildlife and how these plants break down in the environment.
The agency also must approve any herbicide use with herbicide tolerant crops.<sup>16</sup></li>

</ul>

<p>This process can involve several years and at least 10 stages of intermediate 
review, from initial screening to field testing to experimental-use permits. 
Academics, third-party scientists, consumers, growers and the public at large all have 
multiple opportunities to participate.</p>

<p>Regulators consider whether the food produced from a new biotech plant is 
“substantially equivalent” to the food produced from the plant’s conventional 
counterpart. To date, every biotech crop on the market &mdash; from corn to cotton 
to tomatoes &mdash; has been proven “substantially equivalent” and thus fully safe 
to eat and grow.</p>

<p>Several leading health organizations have voiced support for biotechnology, including:
<ul>

<li>The American Medical Association, which recognizes the “many potential benefits 
offered by genetically modified crops and foods &#133; and encourages ongoing research 
in food biotechnology.”<sup>17</sup></li><br>&nbsp;

<li>The American Dietetic Association, which said, “Biotechnology techniques have the 
potential to be useful in enhancing the quality, nutritional value and variety of 
food available for human consumption and in increasing the efficiency of food production,
food processing, food distribution and waste management.”<sup>18</sup></li><br>&nbsp; 

<li>The Institute of Food Technologists, which said plant biotechnology
“offers the potential to rapidly and precisely improve the quantity and 
quality of food available,” and added that the precision of biotechnology will 
lead to “more predictability and an easier safety assessment process.”<sup>19</sup></li><br>&nbsp;

<li>And the World Health Organization, which stated that “the benefits of biotechnology 
are many,” including improved production and reduced pesticide use, and promise 
“major improvements in both food quality and nutrition.”<sup>20</sup></li>

</ul>

<p><a href="index.asp?id=1295">Canada</a> and 
<a href="index.asp?id=1270">Mexico</a> also have
regulatory systems for testing the safety of biotech foods.</p>

<p><b>10. Are biotech foods or ingredients labeled?</b></p>

<p>In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration requires labeling if a biotech
food is significantly different from its conventional counterpart. That is, if
there’s a change in its nutritional content. If the products are “substantially
equivalent,” a label isn’t required. The idea behind this approach is that a
label should not be based on the <i>process used</i> to grow a crop and should
instead be focused on food’s nutritional content. The American Medical
Association has concurred, saying, “There is no scientific justification for
special labeling of genetically modified foods, as a class.”<sup>21</sup></p>

<p>If a biotech food is significantly different from its traditional counterpart &mdash; such
as an orange with higher-than-normal levels of vitamin C &mdash; a label would be
required. The U.S. system is designed to provide consumers with meaningful,
science-based information about the health and nutritional content of their
food, not how the crops that went into that food were produced.</p>

<p>Countries (such as Japan) and trading blocs (such as the European Union) 
that do require labels often have had to develop a long list of exemptions and
loopholes, making implementation difficult.<sup>22</sup> An article
in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> says the European system has “confused consumers” 
and “spawned a bewildering array of marketing claims, counterclaims and outright 
contradictions that only a food scientist possibly could unravel.”<sup>23</sup></p>

<p><b>11. What about consumers’ right to know?</b></p>

<p>Consumers need relevant and meaningful safety and nutritional information to make sound 
food choices. Adding information about the <i>process</i> by which food is grown &mdash; 
and not focusing on foods’ nutritional content &mdash; does not provide relevant safety
information. That’s why the Food and Drug Administration has adopted its
labeling policy based on actual nutritional content.</p>

<p>Today’s foods produced using biotechnology are tested and reviewed repeatedly 
by researchers to make sure they are as safe as their conventional counterparts.
As a result, there’s no need for special labeling.</p>

<p>If the food product is changed in some material way or in a way that may affect 
health, then labels are required. In addition, the FDA is developing guidelines a policy for 
labeling nonbiotech foods so consumers who prefer those foods have an option.</p>

<p><b>12. What is the environmental impact of biotechnology?</b></p>

<p>Biotech crops help farmers protect the environment by allowing less tilling 
so they can preserve top soil, reduce soil erosion and use less fuel. They also 
reduce crop losses from weeds, insects and disease, and increase yields so more food 
can be grown on existing land. That helps preserve wilderness areas. By providing 
better pest control, some biotech crops like cotton also allow farmers to spray less.</p>

<p>Reduced tillage practices in soybeans saved 247 million tons of irreplaceable 
topsoil in 2000, and reduced the number of times farmers had to run equipment over 
fields, which saved 234 million gallons of fuel, according to a November 2001 American 
Soybean Association study.<sup>24</sup> Cotton farmers used 2.7 million
pounds less insecticide in 1999 than in 1995 (the year before pest-resistant Bt
cotton was introduced in the United States<sup>25</sup>) to control pests such as
bollworm and budworm.</p>

<p><b>13. What about the study that said Bt corn kills monarch butterflies?</b><p>

<p>A widely publicized Cornell University laboratory study examined what happened 
when monarch butterfly larvae were force-fed milkweed covered with Bt corn pollen.
After releasing the results, the lead researcher cautioned that
“it would be inappropriate to draw any conclusions about risk to monarch populations 
in the field based solely on these initial results.”<sup>26</sup></p>

<p>In fact, both before and since that lab test, many scientists have studied the risk 
of monarchs’ exposure to Bt corn pollen under natural conditions in fields, and have 
found that the corn poses little risk to the butterflies.</p>

<p>The most recent study was published Sept. 14 by the National Academy of Sciences.
Results from the two-year in-field study concluded that monarch butterfly caterpillars face
“negligible” risk from Bt corn pollen. In fact, by allowing farmers to reduce
spraying, biotech crops have reduced losses of beneficial insects.</p>

<p>In October 2001, the EPA renewed for seven years registrations for varieties of Bt corn. The EPA, which approved
the crop in 1995, 1996 and 1998, concluded that Bt corn “does not pose risks to
human health or to the environment.”<sup>27</sup>

<p><b>14. What about biotech crops leading to the creation of “superweeds” and
other new environmental risks?</b></p>

<p>Genes from a biotech crop technically could spread to wild relatives, although 
such gene flow would not be unique to biotech plants. It’s unlikely to occur in most 
cases, however, for the same reason that a cat can’t breed with a canary. In other 
words, for genetic transfer to occur, plants must be sexually compatible. In the case of
superweeds, there must be wild relatives nearby capable of reproducing with the
cultivated crop.</p>

<p>Since there are no wild relatives of soybeans or corn in the United States,
for example, the chance of creating a superweed is low.<sup>28</sup>
Other crops such as canola, which has wild varieties, require extra precautions
such as planting a border barrier around biotech crops to block the flow of
pollen. Farmers planting these crops are required to take those precautions as
part of their crop management programs.</p>

<p>Even if genes did spread to a wild relative, the bigger question is whether 
this would give weeds a meaningful competitive advantage. Herbicide resistant 
weeds, for example, are a minor nuisance to farmers, but have no advantage in their 
own natural ecosystem.<sup>29</sup> A recent study concluded that biotech plants 
themselves are unlikely to survive long in the wild.<sup>30</sup></p>

<p><b>15. What about the unknown, potential long-term risks of biotechnology?</b></p>

<p> Biotechnology may seem like a new technology, but it has been under 
development and tested for 20 years. And it is based on 150 years of research into 
plant breeding, dating back to Austrian monk Gregor Mendel’s experiments with sweat peas.</p>

<p> There’s no scientific evidence showing that biotech foods are any less safe 
than conventional foods. In fact, biotech foods undergo more extensive testing 
than their traditional counterparts. More than 25,000 field trials have been 
conducted on more than 60 crops in 45 countries, and scientists have detected no
long-term effects on consumers, animals or the environment.<sup>31</sup>
“Many consumers in North America, Europe and China have been eating GM
(genetically modified) food over the past several years, without any
demonstrated adverse effects on human health,” said Ismail Serageldin and
Gabrielle Persley of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural
Research.</p>

<p>While some opponents are lobbying to slow its development or restrict its
uses by citing unknown and unproven potential risks, most of the world cannot
afford to wait to reap biotechnology’s proven benefits.</p>

<p>Per Pinstrup-Andersen of the International Food Policy Research Institute
summed up the issue well. He said, “Condemning biotechnology for its potential risks 
without considering the alternative risks of prolonging the human misery caused by 
hunger, malnutrition and child death is as unwise and unethical as blindly pursuing 
this technology without the necessary biosafety.”<sup>32</sup></p>
