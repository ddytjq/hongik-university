Before the launch of CGRO, most scientists thought that gamma-ray
bursts came from magnetic neutron stars residing in a thick disk in the
Milky Way (see, e.g., Higdon and Lingenfelter 1990, Harding 1991).
Upper limits to the rate of faint bursts (e.g., Fishman et al. 1979)
already implied that the cumulative brightness distribution of
gamma-ray bursts must roll over at the faint end.  Since a uniform
distribution of sources in space requires that the brightness
distribution of the bursts follow a power law with -3/2 slope, the
rollover meant that gamma-ray bursts must be inhomogeneously
distributed in space.  Most scientists expected that BATSE would find
that the sky distribution of faint bursts is concentrated in the
Galactic plane, and would thus confirm that the burst sources lie in a
Galactic disk roughly 2 kpc thick.
<P>
Instead, the data gathered by BATSE confirmed the existence of a
rollover in the cumulative brightness distribution of gamma-ray bursts
but showed that the sky distribution of the faint bursts is consistent
with isotropy (see Figure 1) (Meegan et al. 1992, Briggs et al.
1995).  The rollover in the cumulative brightness distribution and the
isotropic sky distribution imply that we are at, or near, the center of
the spatial distribution of burst sources and that the intrinsic
brightness and/or spatial density of the sources decreases with
increasing distance from us.  Therefore the bursts cannot come from
the Galactic disk.
<P>
While an origin for the bursts in the Oort Cloud of comets that exists
around the solar system is not ruled out, this model suffers from a lack
of any appealing physical mechanism and the likelihood that the Oort
Cloud is not highly spherical.  Consequently, the primary impact of the
BATSE results was to intensify debate about whether the bursts are
Galactic or cosmological in origin.
<P>
There is no overwhelming piece of evidence, no &quot;smoking gun,&quot; which
proves that the bursts are Galactic or cosmological.  That is why we
are having this commemorative debate.  As is so often the case at the
frontier of science, and as it was in the original &quot;Great Debate,&quot; the
evidence is circumstantial, even contradictory.  Yet in the scientific
process, each piece of evidence is weighed.  Some pieces are given more
weight, others less.  And different scientists may give different
weights to the same piece of evidence.  But eventually, through the
process of weighing-up the evidence, scientists reach a conclusion.
<P>
Paczynski (1995) focuses on the isotropic sky
distribution of gamma-ray bursts.  He describes the impact of the
announcement that the sky distribution of the faint bursts is
consistent with isotropy on him and on some others when it was made by
the BATSE team in September 1991 (Meegan et al. 1992).  The isotropy of
the bursts on the sky is an important piece of evidence.  The
cosmological hypothesis is consistent with it.  But the Galactic
hypothesis is also consistent with it (see Figure 2).  If this were all
of the evidence that we considered, quite frankly we could not
distinguish between the cosmological and Galactic hypotheses.  I
contend that we can go further, by considering other important pieces
of evidence, some of them very new.  Indeed, since September 1991 many
unexpected and important pieces of evidence have been discovered which
bear strongly on the question of the distance scale to gamma-ray
bursts.  Of course the conclusion is not yet clear.  But when we
consider all of the evidence, I think you will see that it adds up to a
strong case for the Galactic hypothesis.
<P>
The particular Galactic model that many scientists are now studying is
motivated by the discovery that many neutron stars are born with such
high velocities that they escape from the Galaxy (see Figure 3).  These
neutron stars form a distant, previously unknown Galactic &quot;corona&quot;.
This distant corona contains an ample population of sources which
appear isotropic when viewed from Earth, and can therefore easily
account for the angular and brightness distributions of the BATSE
bursts.  The soft gamma-ray burster phenomenon shows that high velocity
neutron stars can produce burst-like behavior.  Indeed, the famous 1979
March 5 event shows that high velocity neutron stars can produce an
event which has the energy, duration, and spectrum of a gamma-ray
burst.  The Galactic corona model has the attractive feature that it
naturally accounts for the many similarities between gamma-ray bursters
and soft gamma-ray repeaters, which we know are high velocity neutron
stars.  In addition, the model easily explains the rapid time
variability of many bursts, cyclotron lines, repeating, and the lack of
bright optical counterparts.
<P>
On the other hand, the cosmological models that many scientists are
studying, such as coalescing neutron star binaries and failed
supernovae, face severe difficulties in explaining cyclotron lines,
repeating, the lack of bright galaxies in the error boxes of bright
bursts, and even the energies of the bursts.
<P>
Let us now pick up the story of the Galactic hypothesis with the
discovery that many neutron stars have very high velocities.
