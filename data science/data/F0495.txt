<B>API</b>

<B>API</b> (Application Programming Interface) is basically a bunch of <B>procedures</b> (Functions & Subs, but mostly functions) that we can use to make our programs even more powerful than what they already are. There many things VB can't do alone, and that's where API comes in. There are a hell of a lot of API procedures that we can use (couple of thousand...), they vary from API procedures that shut down the computer to API procedures that can find out the amount of space you have free on you HD... I'm sure you have seen API, and even used it before, if you read all my tutorials in order...<Br>
<Br>
Windows API is in .DLL files, which stands for Dynamic Link Library. Windows itself is built on DLLs, check your System folder and you will see there are a lot of them, all which take up quite some space. Dlls load up when they're needed and unload when they have finished being used, what this does for us is that we don't need GBs of RAM in our PCs. In this day in age, your PC should have atleast 32MB RAM, for power users: 128MB or even 256MB RAM. I have 64MB RAM, which is decent (almost...), I hope to get another stick of 64 soon though... Most common API functions are in user32.dll, gdi32.dll, and kernel32.dll files.<Br>
<Br>
Anyway back to API, you can access the API Viewer (VB editions Pro & Ent only) in VBs program group folder. Load the file "Win32api.txt", and check out API Type Declares... You can get all the API you need and copy it very quickly. After doing that you should paste it into a .bas file.<Br>
<Br>
You should also know what the keywords ByVal and ByRef mean... The ByVal (By Value) keyword indicates you want to pass an argument by its original value, and that the value will not be changed. The ByRef (By Reference) keyword indicates that you want to pass an argument by reference, and its value can be changed. If you do not indicate the ByVal keyword, VB passes it ByRef automatically (which is default for some.)<Br>
<Br>
<font color="blue">Here is the API call to Shut Down Windows</font><Br>
<Br>
Declare Function ExitWindowsEx Lib "user32" Alias "ExitWindowsEx" (ByVal uFlags As Long, ByVal dwReserved As Long) As Long<Br>
<Br>
And here is one way to use it...<Br>
<Br>
ExitWindowsEx 1, 1<Br>
<Br>
<font color="blue">API in general...</font><Br>
<Br>
First you have to declare the API by using "Declare", and in front of it you can even specify the scope of it by using the Private or Public statements...<Br>
<Br>
See the "Lib" keyword? That means that the procedure is kept in a DLL file...<Br>
<Br>
Next you see the name of the library it's in (user32)...<Br>
<Br>
Alias? WTF is that? heh, that just means that the procedure is specified inside the DLL library, by another name...<Br>
<Br>
And then of coarse you have the "arguments" that will be given to the DLL...<Br>
<Br>
Finally, the return data type for the procedure, which in the API above is Long, or in short &...<Br>

Hopefully now you know a little bit more on API... It's not too hard to use, but some times it can get a little messy.<Br>
