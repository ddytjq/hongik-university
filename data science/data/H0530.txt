<P>A brief history of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Human Genome Program 
  (HGP) will be useful in clarifying the objectives of the DOE program as well 
  as those of the collaborative U.S. Human Genome Project. DOE's Office of Biological 
  and Environmental Research [OBER, changed in 1998 from the Office of Health 
  and Environmental Research (OHER)] and DOE's predecessor agencies--the Atomic 
  Energy Commission and the Energy Research and Development Administration--have 
  long sponsored research into genetics, including that of microbial systems and 
  mammals. This research involves basic studies of genome structure, replication, 
  damage, repair, and the consequences of radiation-induced heritable mutations. 
  Scientists have recognized for years that the DNA in the cell nucleus (the repository 
  of information controlling cell structures and functions) was the cellular component 
  most susceptible to damage from radiation and chemicals. Thus a detailed knowledge 
  of the DNA sequence (in essence its information content) would enable better 
  assessments of damage to it. See <a href="http://www.ornl.gov/hgmis/project/timeline.html">Timeline</a> 
  and <a href="http://www.ornl.gov/hgmis/publicat/tko/01_foreword.html">Foreword</a> 
  and <a href="http://www.ornl.gov/hgmis/publicat/tko/02_why.html">Why DOE</a> 
  from <i>To Know Ourselves</i>.</P>


<P>Before the HGP began, DOE OBER was already engaged in several multidisciplinary 
  projects contributing to the nation's biomedical capabilities, including the 
  GenBank DNA sequence repository initiated and sustained by DOE computer and 
  data-management expertise at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Major user facilities 
  supporting microstructure research were developed and are maintained by DOE. 
  Unique chromosome-processing resources and capabilities were in place at Los 
  Alamos and Lawrence Livermore national laboratories. Among these were fluorescence-activated 
  cell sorter (FACS) systems to purify human chromosomes that were part of the 
  National Laboratory Gene Library Project for producing DNA clone libraries. 
  The availability of these monochromosomal libraries opened an important path--a 
  practical way to subdivide the huge total genome into 24 much more manageable 
  components. </P>


<P>In 1984, OBER and the International Commission on Protection Against
Environmental Mutagens and Carcinogens cosponsored a conference in Alta,
Utah, that highlighted the growing roles of recombinant DNA technologies.
Substantial portions of the meeting's proceedings were incorporated into the
Congressional Office of Technology Assessment report, <EM>Technologies for
Detecting Heritable Mutations in Humans</EM>, in which the value of a reference
sequence of the human genome was recognized. </P>


<P>Acquisition of such a reference sequence was, however, far beyond the
capabilities of biomedical research resources and infrastructure existing at that
time. Although the small genomes of several microbes had been mapped or
partially sequenced, the detailed mapping and eventual sequencing of 24 distinct
human chromosomes (22 autosomes and the sex chromosomes X and Y) was a
much larger task. </P>


<P>From these interests, capabilities, and discussions, OBER began in 1986 to 
  consider the feasibility of a human genome program. Leading scientists were 
  invited to the March 1986 international conference at Santa Fe, New Mexico, 
  to assess the desirability and feasibility of implementing such a project. With 
  virtual unanimity, participants agreed that ordering and eventually sequencing 
  DNA clones representing the human genome were desirable and feasible goals. 
  With this enthusiastic response, OBER initiated several pilot projects and sought 
  further program guidance from the DOE Biological and Environmental Research 
  Advisory Committee [BERAC, changed in 1998 from the Health and Environmental 
  Research Advisory Committee (HERAC)]. </P>


<P><b>The BERAC Recommendation </b></P>


<P>The April 1987 BERAC report recommended that DOE and the nation commit to
a large, multidisciplinary, scientific and technological undertaking to map and
sequence the human genome. DOE was particularly well suited to focus on
resource and technology development, the report noted. BERAC further
recommended a leadership role for DOE because of its demonstrated expertise in
managing complex and long-term multidisciplinary projects involving both the
development of new technologies and the coordination of efforts in industries,
universities, and its own laboratories. A 1988 study by the National Research
Council (NRC) titled <EM>Mapping and Sequencing the Human Genome</EM> recommended
that the United States support a human genome program and presented an outline
for a multiphase plan. </P>


<P><b>National Research Centers</b></P>


<P>Three genome research centers were established in 1988-89 at Lawrence Berkeley, 
  Lawrence Livermore, and Los Alamos national laboratories. In January 1997, the 
  three centers were merged into the <a href="http://jgi.doe.gov">Joint Genome 
  Institute (JGI)</a> (see <a href="http://www.ornl.gov/hgmis/publicat/hgn/v9n3/01eyes.html">"Eyes 
  on the Prize: Deliver the Sequence,"</a> and <a href="http://www.ornl.gov/hgmis/publicat/hgn/v10n1/01jgi.html">&quot;DOE 
  Joint Genome Institute Exceeds DNA Sequencing Goal,&quot;</a> <EM><i>Human Genome 
  News</i></EM>). The merger represents a shift toward large-scale sequencing 
  and integrates work at the three centers via intensified collaborations. "The 
  Joint Genome Institute will enable more efficient cooperation among DOE laboratories 
  to develop the next generation of genome sequencing technologies," said Martha 
  Krebs, director of DOE's Office of Energy Research. </P>


<P>In addition to production sequencing, a major goal of the JGI is to enrich the
sequence data with information about its biological function, dubbed "functional
genomics" as compared to the "structural genomics" of generating maps and other
resources in the Human Genome Project. Functional genomics projects will focus
on studying domains sequenced by the JGI. </P>


<P><b>DOE-NIH Coordination</b></P>


<P>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) also was a necessary participant in 
  the large-scale effort to map and sequence the human genome because of its biomedical 
  research mission and its vast community of scientists. This was confirmed by 
  the NRC report, which recommended a major role for NIH. In 1987, under the leadership 
  of Director James Wyngaarden, NIH established the Office of Genome Research 
  in the Director's Office. In 1989 this office became the National Center for 
  Human Genome Research (NCHGR), directed by James D. Watson. After Watson's resignation 
  in April 1992, Michael Gottesman was appointed NCHGR Acting Director. In 1993, 
  Francis Collins was made Director of NCHGR, which became the <a href="http://www.nhgri.nih.gov/">National 
  Human Genome Research Institute</a> (NHGRI) in 1997. </P>


<P>In addition to extramural support for research projects in physical mapping 
  and the development of index linkage markers and technology, NIH supports genetic 
  mapping based on family studies and, following NRC recommendations, studies 
  on several relevant model organisms. DOE-supported genome research is focused 
  on the human genome and on comparative mouse genomics through large-scale physical 
  mapping, resource and instrumentation technology development, and improvements 
  in computational and database capabilities and research infrastructure. In a 
  1994 spinoff from the HGP, DOE initiated the highly successful <a href="http://www.er.doe.gov/production/ober/EPR/mig_top.html">Microbial 
  Genome Program</a> to determine the complete sequence of bacteria having potential 
  usefulness in energy, environmental, and evolutionary research.</P>


<P>DOE and NIH cooperated to support critical resources such as the <a href="http://gdbwww.gdb.org/">Genome 
  Database</a> (GDB) formerly based at Johns Hopkins University. Cofunded in 1991 
  as the central international repository of human chromosome mapping and related 
  data, GDB also received some funds from other nations. In addition, nine international 
  nodes of GDB had copies of all GDB data. DOE later assumed lead responsibility 
  for GDB with some NIH funding. Active DOE support for GDB ceased in January 
  1999, with a copy of the database posted at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory 
  <a href="http://compbio.ornl.gov/gac">Genome Annotation Consortium</a> site. 
  GDB has since received other support and is continuing to serve the scientific 
  community from the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.</P>


<P>DOE and NIH NHGRI also have cooperated to support joint workshops and some 
  ethical, legal, and social issues projects. Advisory groups meet periodically 
  to define program needs and develop recommendations for the DOE and NIH programs. 
</P>


<P>Rapid progress and technology developments during the first half of the project 
  have affirmed researchers' optimism that the task can be completed ahead of 
  time and within budget. A final 5-year set of <a href="http://www.ornl.gov/hgmis/publicat/hgn/v10n1/03goal.html"> 
  U.S. goals</a> was presented to Congress in the fall of 1998. Priorities through 
  2003 include the following: </P>

<ul>
  <li>Clone and sequence full-length cDNAs of humans and model organisms, especially 
    mouse. </li>
  <li>Develop and improve software for determining and assembling sequences and 
    recognizing expressed genes. </li>
  <li>Identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms as measures of human variation. 
  </li>
  <li>Continue to study ethical, legal, and social issues related to the project. 
  </li>
</ul>

  <P>Although initially controversial in the scientific community, the genome 
    project's value has been proved beyond question. The wider biological and 
    scientific communities in the United States and around the world are developing 
    tools and applications for the new data in such wide-ranging fields as medicine, 
    agriculture, bioremediation, and industrial enzymology. International efforts 
    have played a critical role in the project's success, with at least 18 countries 
    now supporting programs for analyzing the genomes of a variety of organisms 
    ranging from microbes to economically important plants and animals to humans.
