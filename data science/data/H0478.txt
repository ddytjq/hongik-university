TITLE:  Cloning the antibody response in humans with inflammatory central
nervous system disease: analysis of the expressed IgG repertoire in subacute

ABSTRACT:  The presence of increased IgG in the brains of humans with
infectious and inflammatory CNS diseases of unknown etiology such as multiple
sclerosis may be a clue to the cause of disease. For example, the intrathecally
synthesized oligoclonal bands (OGBs) in diseases such as subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE) or cryptococcal meningitis have been shown to represent
Ab directed against the causative agents, measles virus (MV) or Cryptococcus
neoformans, respectively. Using SSPE as a model system, we have developed a
PCR-based strategy to analyze the repertoire of IgG V region sequences
expressed in SSPE brain. We observed abnormal expression of germline V
segments, overrepresentation of particular sequences that correspond to the
oligoclonal bands, and substantial somatic mutation of most clones from the
germline, which, taken together, constitute features of Ag-driven selection in
the IgG response. Using the most abundant or most highly mutated gamma H chain
and kappa or lambda L chain sequences in various combinations, we constructed
functional Abs in IgG mammalian expression vectors. Three Abs specifically
stained MV-infected cells. One Ab also stained cells transfected with the MV
nucleoprotein, and a second Ab stained cells transfected with the MV-fusion
protein. This technique demonstrates that functional Abs produced from putative
disease-relevant IgG sequences can be used to recognize their corresponding
Ags.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Measles virus (MV) infects 40 million persons and kills one million
per year primarily by suppressing the immune system and afflicting the central
nervous system (CNS). The lack of a suitable small animal model has impeded
progress of understanding how MV causes disease and the development of novel
therapies and improved vaccines. We tested a transgenic mouse line in which
expression of the MV receptor CD46 closely mimicked the location and amount of
CD46 found in humans. Virus replicated in and was recovered from these animals'
immune systems and was associated with suppression of humoral and cellular
immune responses. Infectious virus was recovered from the CNS, replicated
primarily in neurons, and spread to distal sites presumably by fast axonal
transport. Thus, a small animal model is available for analysis of MV
pathogenesis.<p>

ABSTRACT:  OBJECTIVES: The value of measurements of serum C-reactive protein
(CRP) in differentiating central nervous system (CNS) infections of varying
etiologies in the Philippines was investigated. METHODS: A wide array of
bacteriologic and virologic methods as well as computed tomography, typical
clinical presentation, and autopsy were used for etiologic diagnosis. RESULTS:
Among 103 patients with CNS infection, etiology was identified in 60 (58%)
cases. Bacteria were found in 19 (including 7 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 5
Haemophilus influenzae, 3 Neisseria meningitidis), tuberculosis in 4, viruses
in 38 (including 20 coxsackievirus, 8 measles, 4 adenovirus, and 4 poliovirus
infections), and brain abscess in 3 patients. C-reactive protein was elevated
on admission in all 18 cases of bacterial meningitis tested, exceeding 50 mg/L
in 17 (94%), and was not affected by prior antibacterial treatment. The mean
CRP was significantly higher in the bacterial group than in the viral group
(207 +/- 111 mg/L vs. 39 +/- 34 mg/L; P &lt; 0.001). In the viral group one
third had CRP above 50 mg/L. In patients with tuberculous meningitis, brain
abscess, or cryptococcal meningitis, CRP was moderately to highly elevated.
CONCLUSIONS: In the presence of a normal CRP concentration (below 10 mg/mL)
acute bacterial meningitis is excluded even in a developing country setting and
antimicrobial therapy is not warranted.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Measles virus (MV) infections normally cause an acute self limiting
disease which is resumed by a virus-specific immune response and leads to the
establishment of a lifelong immunity. Complications associated with acute
measles can, on rare occasions, involve the central nervous system (CNS). These
are postinfectious measles encephalitis which develops soon after infection,
and, months to years after the acute disease, measles inclusion body
encephalitis (MIBE) and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) which are
based on a persistent MV infection of brain cells. Before the advent of HIV,
SSPE was the best studied slow viral infection of the CNS, and particular
restrictions of MV gene expression as well as MV interactions with neural cells
have revealed important insights into the pathogenesis of persistent viral CNS
infections. MV CNS complication do, however, not large contribute to the high
rate of mortality seen in association with acute measles worldwide. The latter
is due to a virus-induced suppression of immune functions which favors the
establishment of opportunistic infections. Mechanisms underlying MV-mediated
immunosuppression are not well understood. Recent studies have indicated that
MV-induced disruption of immune functions may be multifactorial including the
interference with cytokine synthesis, the induction of soluble inhibitory
factors or apoptosis and negative signalling to T cells by the viral
glycoproteins expressed on the surface of infected cells, particularly
dendritic cells.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The patient is a 10-year-old male who experienced somnolence and
incomplete quadriplegia after headache and vomiting, without exanthema, for 3
days. The clinical course and magnetic resonance imaging findings of the brain
and spinal cord were compatible with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. The
serologic examination revealed that the patient had rubeola because titers of
IgM and IgG antibody to measles virus measured by enzyme immunoassay were 0.91
and 40 (cutoff = 0.80 and 2), respectively, at 5 weeks after the onset, the IgM
titer had become negative (0.56), and the IgG titer had decreased to 17.7 at 13
weeks after the onset. Because the patient had received a measles-mumps-rubella
vaccine at 12 months of age, the acute disseminated encephalomyelitis was
thought to be attributed to the modified measles resulting from measles vaccine
failure.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Molecular determinants of neuropathogenesis have been shown to be
present in the hemagglutinin (H) protein of measles virus (MV). An H gene
insertion vector has been generated from the Edmonston B vaccine full-length
infectious clone of MV. Using this vector, it is possible to insert complete H
open reading frames into the parental (Edtag) background. The H gene from a
rodent brain-adapted MV strain (CAM/RB) was inserted into this vector, and a
recombinant virus (EdtagCAMH) was rescued by using a modified vaccinia virus
which expresses T7 RNA polymerase (MVA-T7). The recombinant virus grew at an
equivalent rate and to similar titers as the CAM/RB and Edtag parental viruses.
Neurovirulence was assayed in a mouse model for MV encephalitis. Viruses were
injected intracerebrally into the right cortex of C57/BL/6 suckling mice. After
infection mice inoculated with the CAM/RB strain developed hind limb paralysis
and ataxia. Clinical symptoms were never observed with an equivalent dose of
Edtag virus or in sham infections. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to
detect viral antigen in formalin-fixed brain sections. Measles antigen was
observed in neurons and neuronal processes of the hippocampus, frontal,
temporal, and olfactory cortices and neostriatum on both sides of symmetrical
structures. Viral antigen was not detected in mice infected with Edtag virus.
Mice infected with the recombinant virus, EdtagCAMH, became clinically ill, and
virus was detected by IHC in regions of the brain similar to those in which it
was detected in animals infected with CAM/RB. The EdtagCAMH infection had,
however, progressed much less than the CAM/RB virus at 4 days postinfection. It
therefore appears that additional determinants are encoded in other regions of
the MV genome which are required for full neurovirulence equivalent to CAM/RB.
Nevertheless, replacement of the H gene alone is sufficient to cause
neuropathology.<p>

ABSTRACT:  OBJECTIVE: To analyse whether an HIV-1 envelope protein might play a
role in damaging the blood-brain barrier as a fundamental step in the early
invasion of the central nervous system by HIV-1. DESIGN: Analysis of
permeability of rat brain endothelium cultures to albumin, to assess the
functional integrity of the vascular component of the blood-brain barrier.
METHODS: Rat brain endothelium cultures prepared by cerebral microvessels were
exposed to recombinant gp120IIIB on microporous membranes and passage of
biotin-labelled albumin was analysed. Scanning electron microscopy was used to
analyse cell culture morphology. Some cultures were preincubated with
N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a selective inhibitor of nitric oxide
synthase, or with spantide, a selective substance P antagonist. RESULTS: HIV-1
gp120 increased the permeability of rat brain endothelial cells to albumin in a
dose-dependent manner. Scanning electron microscopy revealed profound
gp120-induced alterations in cell morphology accounting for the increased
permeability to macromolecules. These alterations were neutralized by
anti-gp120 monoclonal antibody but not by isotype control antibody or L-NAME.
By contrast, spantide and anti-substance P polyclonal antibody completely
blocked the gp120-induced increase in albumin permeability. Control cultures
exposed to measles virus nucleoprotein showed an increase in permeability that
was not blocked by spantide. Brain endothelial cells, exposed to gp120,
displayed cell surface immunoreactivity for substance P, suggesting that
substance P is secreted by brain endothelium in response to gp120 stimulation
and binds to brain endothelial cells through a receptor-mediated mechanism.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a role for substance P in the gp120-induced
increase in permeability of brain endothelium.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We have developed a strategy to identify the disease-relevant
antigens in a chronic inflammatory CNS disease exhibiting intrathecally
expressed oligoclonal IgG. Using subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a
chronic inflammatory measles virus infection of the brain as a model system, we
constructed a phage display antibody Fab library from the amplified products of
IgG expressed in the brain. Selection of the library against measles
virus-infected cell lysates yielded four distinct Fabs which, by ELISA and by
immunostaining, reacted specifically with measles virus-infected cells. Three
Fabs immunoprecipitated a 72 kDa protein from infected cell cultures
corresponding to the measles virus phosphoprotein. The fourth Fab
immunoprecipitated and recognized by immunoblotting a 60 kDa protein
corresponding to the measles virus nucleoprotein. The results demonstrate that
functional antibodies from an inflammatory CNS disease can be expressed in
bacteria and used to identify disease-relevant antigens. This approach could be
applied to chronic inflammatory CNS diseases of unknown cause such as multiple
sclerosis.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Expression of the human measles virus receptor, CD46, in the murine
central nervous system allows infection and replication by wild-type human
measles virus (MV) strains (Rall, G.F., Manchester, M., Daniels L.R., Callahan,
E., Belman, A., Oldstone, M.B.A., 1997. A transgenic mouse model for measles
virus infection of the brain. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94, 2243-2248). MV
replicates in neurons in focal lesions of the cortex, hippocampus and thalamus,
leading to death of the animals. In MV-infected CD46 transgenic mice,
infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes and macrophages was
seen. Upregulation of MHC class I and class II molecules was observed, along
with reactive astrocytosis and microgliosis. Increased chemokine mRNAs,
especially RANTES and IP-10, and cytokine RNAs IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL1-beta
were observed. Apoptosis of neurons also was increased. No MV replication or
inflammation was seen in similarly inoculated nontransgenic littermates. These
results further characterize the MV-induced encephalitis in CD46 transgenic
mice and highlight similarities to MV infection of the human CNS.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Forty-seven common dolphins (Delphinus delphis ponticus) were
stranded on the northern shores of the Black Sea between mid-July and early
September 1994, more than in previous or subsequent years. Two of the 47
dolphins were examined in detail to try to determine the cause of the increased
stranding rate. Their lesions included broncho-interstitial pneumonia with type
II epithelial cell hyperplasia and multinucleate syncytial cells, neuronal
necrosis, gliosis, and non-suppurative meningitis of the brain, necrotic
stomatitis, gastroenteritis and cholangitis, and lymphoid depletion of the
spleen and lymph nodes. The diseased tissues stained positive in an
immunoperoxidase test, using a polyclonal antiserum to measles virus as the
primary antibody, and electron microscopy showed that they contained
regularly-shaped intranuclear particles about 22 nm in diameter. They were
positive by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the nucleoprotein gene of
morbillivirus. However, there was no evidence of morbillivirus in frozen
tissues either by virus isolation or by antigen capture ELISA. The
concentration of sigma DDTS in the blubber of both dolphins was about 50 to 100
times higher than the levels in toothed cetaceans from the North Sea, North
Atlantic Ocean, and Baltic Sea. The lesions were consistent with those found in
other species with morbilliviral disease, and the positive immunoperoxidase
test, PCR and electron microscopical examination confirmed a morbillivirus as
the primary cause of these lesions.<p>

deficient cellular immunity, the elevated antimeasles antibody titers and CSF
findings indicated that humoral immunity was not impaired. Histologic, electron
microscopic, and immunocytochemical studies revealed the typical intranuclear
inclusions of paramyxovirus nucleocapsids, and measles virus antigen in neurons
and oligodendrocytes.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The main trends are described in the studies of subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis conducted in Poland or abroad with participation of Polish
scientists. The history of these studies began in the years 1957-1959 with the
works of Wender and Osetowska and ends presently at the end of our century with
extinction of SSPE as a result of consistently conducted obligatory
vaccinations against measles. The studies of Polish authors involved the
problems of clinical diagnosis using immunological, electrophysiological and
neurological imaging methods. Neuropathological problems were also studied
extensively. Parallely with similar studies in the foremost foreign centres
trials of SSPE treatment were undertaken in Poland, in recent years by means of
intracerebroventricular administration of interferons. An original Polish
method was the treatment with inducers of endogenous interferons. After the
introduction of vaccinations against measles epidemiological studies repeated
in the whole country were introduced for the assessment of the results of this
preventive measure. These studies are regarded as model ones at international
level.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The authors report a case of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in
a child who had measles during the neonatal period. At 3 years, 6 months of
age, over a period of a few weeks, the patient lost the ability to sit unaided
as a result of progressive truncal ataxia, without apparent cognitive changes,
simulating acute cerebellar ataxia. His symptoms improved in 1 month, and he
was able to walk again with support, but mental alteration and periodic mild
head nodding on awakening followed. His illness was diagnosed as subacute
sclerosing panencephalitis on the basis of the elevated titers of measles
antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid. Measles infection before 1 year of age
is a risk factor of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, but reports about
patients with neonatal measles infection are rare. Immaturity of the brain at
the time of measles infection may not only be a risk factor but may also
influence the clinical course of the disease.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In many cases of neurological disease associated with viral
infection, such as measles virus (MV)-induced subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis in children, it is unclear whether the virus or the antiviral
immune response within the brain is the cause of disease. MV inoculation of
transgenic mice expressing the human MV receptor, CD46, exclusively in neurons
resulted in neuronal infection and fatal encephalitis within 2 weeks in
neonates, while mice older than 3 weeks of age were resistant to both infection
and disease. At all ages, T lymphocytes infiltrated the brain in response to
inoculation. To determine the role of lymphocytes in disease progression,
CD46(+) mice were back-crossed to T- and B-cell-deficient RAG-2 knockout mice.
The lymphocyte deficiency did not affect the outcome of disease in neonates,
but adult CD46(+) RAG-2(-) mice were much more susceptible to both neuronal
infection and central nervous system disease than their immunocompetent
littermates. These results indicate that CD46-dependent MV infection of
neurons, rather than the antiviral immune response in the brain, produces
neurological disease in this model system and that immunocompetent adult mice,
but not immunologically compromised or immature mice, are protected from
infection.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In an autopsy study the distribution of measles virus (MV) in the
central nervous system (CNS) of 18 measles-infected children (13 HIV
seropositive, 5 HIV seronegative), in Abidjan, Ivory Coast was examined using
immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization. Of these children 17 died from
measles giant cell pneumonia. In 3 of the 13 HIV-seropositive patients MV
antigens and genomic RNA was detected in the CNS. One of these positive
patients had an MV encephalitis with abundant virus throughout most of the CNS.
MV was not detected in the CNS of any of the 5 HIV-seronegative patients. These
findings, albeit in a small number of cases, would suggest there may be an
increased susceptibility to infection of the CNS with MV in HIV-positive
children. In this respect entry and growth of MV in the CNS in HIV-seropositive
individuals may be similar to the occurrence of measles inclusion body
encephalitis in immunocompromised individuals. Furthermore, comparison of the
HIV-MV encephalitis patient with two patients with subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE) demonstrated a paucity of virus in neuronal processes in
the HIV-MV encephalitis. Unlike in SSPE, MV maturation by budding through the
plasma membrane may occur, thereby minimizing build up of and intracellular
movement of incomplete virus.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A major source of inflammatory cytokines in the measles virus
(MV)-infected brain are astrocytes, which produce a variety of soluble
mediators including interferons-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta), interleukin-1
(IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-6 (IL-6).
Using the MV-strain Edmonston (ED) and the recombinant MV-strain MGV in which
the MV-envelope proteins H and F have been replaced by the vesicular stomatitis
virus (VSV) envelope protein G, we investigated IL-6 induction in human U-251
astrocytoma cells in the presence and absence of a MV-specific receptor (CD46)
interaction. The CD46-MV interaction did not inhibit the induction of
cytokines. Similar multiplicities of infection of MGV induced generally lower
levels of IL-6 than MV-ED. UV-inactivated replication-incompetent MV-ED induced
low levels of IL-6. In contrast, MGV did not induce IL-6 after inactivation
with UV light, indicating that the MV-ED-receptor interaction or the uptake of
viral particles by membrane fusion induced IL-6, whereas interaction with the
VSV-G receptor and uptake of viral particles by endocytosis did not induce
IL-6. Crosslink of the MV-receptor CD46 with antibodies and treatment of cells
with purified viral glycoproteins led to the induction of small but significant
amounts of IL-6. Our data suggest that triggering of CD46 and associated
protein kinases can lead to the induction of low levels of IL-6, whereas the
replication of the negative strand RNA virus constitutes the major stimulus
leading to the synthesis of high levels of IL-6 in astrocytes.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We report an extended set of neuroimmunological data detected in
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from n = 267 patients with definite multiple
sclerosis (MS). Known frequencies of oligoclonal IgG (98%), frequencies of
intrathecal fractions of IgG, IgA and IgM (72%, 9% and 20%, respectively) were
confirmed and quantitated as intrathecal fractions, IgIF or CSF concentrations,
IgLOC. Eighty-nine per cent of the patients had a combined 'MRZ-reaction', i.e.
intrathecal antibody synthesis (Antibody Index, AI &gt; 1.4) against measles,
rubella and/or varicella zoster virus. Frequencies of single antibodies
decreased from measles (78%) to rubella (60%), VZV (55%) and HSV (28%). This
MRZ-reaction, indicating a chronic autoimmune type disease already at time of
first clinical symptoms, is less sensitive but more specific than detection of
oligoclonal IgG. With increasing intrathecal IgG synthesis the number of
different locally synthesized antibody species were increased as well as the
amount per species (increased mean AI values). The concentration of MRZ
antibodies in CSF represents together about 2% of intrathecally synthesized
total IgG. But, as a very particular result the ratio of intrathecally
synthesized specific antibody/intrathecally synthesized JgG was 5-fold higher
(0.24-0.85%) compared to the corresponding ratio in blood (0.06-0.17%) of MS
patients. This difference between brain ratio and blood ratio is discussed to
be indicative for the anti-MRZ antibody forming B-lymphocyte subset in blood
migrating into brain at earlier time of pathophysiological start of disease.
These results give a concise explanation of neuroimmunological aspects in MS,
not understood so far.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The susceptibility of CD46 (human membrane cofactor protein)
transgenic mice to measles virus (MV) infection was investigated. Cell cultures
(lung and kidney) established from transgenic and control mice showed that
although both could be infected only those from the CD46+ mice gave fusion. A
complete round of replication with the release of infectious virus was detected
exclusively in the transgenic cell cultures whose permissiveness to MV was
markedly less than that of Vero cells. The ability of MV to replicate in vivo
in mice was studied using both vaccine and laboratory-adapted wild-type strains
of virus. After intraperitoneal and intranasal inoculations of transgenic mice,
virus replication could not be detected. In contrast intracerebral inoculation
induced infection in both transgenic and nontransgenic mice. Our results from
in vitro infection studies support the hypothesis that CD46 is a major host
cell factor involved in the MV-induced fusion process and MV entry. The studies
further indicate that MV tropism is not governed solely by the expression of
the CD46 gene and that the high efficiency of the replicative cycles
characteristic of fully permissive host cells requires additional factors,
which are lacking in both transgenic and nontransgenic mice. Copyright 1998

ABSTRACT:  Considering an autoimmunity and autism connection, brain
autoantibodies to myelin basic protein (anti-MBP) and neuron-axon filament
protein (anti-NAFP) have been found in autistic children. In this current
study, we examined associations between virus serology and autoantibody by
simultaneous analysis of measles virus antibody (measles-IgG), human
herpesvirus-6 antibody (HHV-6-IgG), anti-MBP, and anti-NAFP. We found that
measles-IgG and HHV-6-IgG titers were moderately higher in autistic children
but they did not significantly differ from normal controls. Moreover, we found
that a vast majority of virus serology-positive autistic sera was also positive
for brain autoantibody: (i) 90% of measles-IgG-positive autistic sera was also
positive for anti-MBP; (ii) 73% of measles-IgG-positive autistic sera was also
positive for anti-NAFP; (iii) 84% of HHV-6-IgG-positive autistic sera was also
positive for anti-MBP; and (iv) 72% of HHV-6-IgG-positive autistic sera was
also positive for anti-NAFP. This study is the first to report an association
between virus serology and brain autoantibody in autism; it supports the
hypothesis that a virus-induced autoimmune response may play a causal role in
autism. Copyright 1998 Academic Press.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We reported a patient with measles encephaloneuropathy. A
26-year-old woman in her 15th week of gestation became febrile and developed
cutaneous eruption typical of measles on July 1 1997. Five days after
appearance of the rash, fetal death was identified and the fetus was removed.
Following the operation, she became comatous. Neurological examination revealed
neck stiffness, flaccid paralysis of the four limbs, and decreased sweating in
the lower limbs. CSF protein was 143 mg/dl with cell count of 1365/mm3. Myelin
basic protein in CSF was positive. High titers of antimeasles antibodies were
found in the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid. EEG revealed a predominance of
slow waves. In MRI obtained earlier in her illness, high signal intensity areas
were noted to spread in the brain stem and external capsule on T2-weighted
images. However, T1-weighted image was unremarkable. Serial
electrophysiological studies suggested demyelination of the motor nerves. With
combination of methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin therapy, she made a
remarkable recovery without any neurologic sequelae. We believe that the
measles encephalitis in our patient is predominantly demyelinating due to an
immunologic reaction in a pathophysiological aspect. We should pay attention to
coincident poly-radiculoneuropathy in the early stage of measles
encephalopathy.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Measles viruses isolated from brain cells of patients with subacute
sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) have numerous mutations, especially in the
matrix protein (M) gene. To find whether the M genes of these SSPE viruses were
mutated randomly or in a pattern, we sequenced this gene from three strains of
defective measles virus isolated in Osaka, Japan. We could deduce the sequence
of the possible progenitor measles virus for each patient by comparison of the
isolate with measles viruses prevailing at roughly the same time and place as
the primary infection. Biased hypermutation affected the M genes of all three
SSPE viruses, although the molecular mechanisms for the mutations might be
various. Replacements of U with C in the plus strand accounted for 76% of all
mutations in two of the strains, but in the other strain, replacements of A
with G accounted for 52% of the mutations, and the U residues were unchanged.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Attenuated Edmonston measles virus (MV-Edm) is not pathogenic in
standard mice. We show here that MV-Edm inoculated via the natural respiratory
route has a limited propagation in the lungs of mice with a targeted mutation
inactivating the alpha/beta interferon receptor. A high dose of MV-Edm
administered intracerebrally is lethal for about half of these mice. To study
the consequences of the availability of a high-affinity receptor for MV
propagation, we generated alpha/beta interferon-defective mice expressing human
CD46 with human-like tissue specificity. Intranasal infection of these mice
with MV-Edm resulted in enhanced spread to the lungs and more prominent
inflammatory response. Virus replication was also detected in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells, the spleen, and the liver. Moreover, intracerebral
inoculation of adult animals with low MV-Edm doses caused encephalitis with
almost inevitably lethal outcome. We conclude that in mice alpha/beta
interferon controls MV infection and that a high-affinity receptor facilitates,
but is not strictly required for, MV spread and pathogenesis.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Measles viruses (MV) can be isolated from the brains of deceased
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis patients only in a cell-associated form.
These viruses are often defective in the matrix (M) protein and always seem to
have an altered fusion protein cytoplasmic tail. We reconstituted a cell-free,
infectious M-less MV (MV-DeltaM) from cDNA. In comparison with standard MV,
MV-DeltaM was considerably more efficient at inducing cell-to-cell fusion but
virus titres were reduced approximately 250-fold. In MV-DeltaM-induced syncytia
the ribonucleocapsids and glycoproteins largely lost co-localization,
confirming the role of M protein as the virus assembly organizer. Genetically
modified mice were inoculated with MV-DeltaM or with another highly fusogenic
virus bearing glycoproteins with shortened cytoplasmic tails (MV-Delta(tails)).
MV-DeltaM and MV-Delta(tails) lost acute pathogenicity but penetrated more
deeply into the brain parenchyma than standard MV. We suggest that enhanced
cell fusion may also favour the propagation of mutated, assembly-defective MV
in human brains.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A highly sensitive measles-specific RT-PCR-nested PCR system was
established, which consistently amplified measles virus genome sequence from
control samples containing as little as 5.5 x 10(-3) pfu per reaction. This
method failed to detect the presence of measles virus in 93 colonoscopic
biopsies and 31 peripheral blood lymphocyte preparations, examined and obtained
from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and noninflammatory
controls. All patients had detectable levels of serum neutralization antibody
against measles virus. Each biopsy was estimated to have about one million
cells, based on the amplification of the beta actin gene. The assay was
calibrated by use of a known number of lymphocytes. The method applied was able
to amplify measles virus RNA from a nucleic acid mixture equivalent to 18 cells
derived from subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) brain material. The
level of measles RNA present, if any, in the biopsies is therefore at least
50,000-fold less than in SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In two patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) of
10 and 25 months duration we demonstrated by immunohistochemistry the presence
of measles-virus nucleocapsid antigen (MVNA) in CD68+ cells and astrocytes of
brain tissues. In both cases, CD68+ hematogenous monocyte/ macrophages and
perivascular microglial cells (Mphi) were found infiltrating the brain
parenchyma, and often partially or completely invested by perivascular reactive
astrocytes expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Mphi with
cytoplasmic MVNA were often seen in the Virchow-Robin spaces and in close
association with perivascular astrocytes, which often also contained MVNA+
intracytoplasmic inclusions. Reactive astrocytosis was more severe in the
patient with long-standing illness, and a correspondingly elevated number of
strongly GFAP+ MVNA+ or MVNA- perivascular binucleated astrocytes was observed.
An uptake of MVNA+ cell debris by reactive astrocytes was evident in areas of
white matter displaying extensive demyelination and necrosis. Taken together,
these observations seem to indicate that the brain infiltration by Mphi
carrying measles virus could represent one pathway of virus entry and
dissemination in the central nervous system. Virus transfer to perivascular
astrocytes via cell-to-cell contacts with infected macrophages is also
suggested.<p>

ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND: Subacute measles encephalitis (SME), or measles
inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE), is a rare central nervous system (CNS)
complication following infection by the measles (rubeola) virus. It usually
occurs in young patients with defective cellular immunity from either
congenital or acquired causes. In the United States, with the resurgence of
measles infection and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic, subacute
measles encephalitis should be added to the differential diagnosis in acquired
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients presenting with unexplained CNS
manifestations. CASE: A 2-year-old, HIV-positive, white male was admitted for
generalized convulsive seizures. Vaccination was described as "up to date."
Despite treatment with anticonvulsive drugs, the child continued to develop
frequent partial and generalized seizures. Cephalic computed tomography and
magnetic resonance imaging revealed a hypodense area in the right
parietotemporal cortex without an associated mass effect. Fine needle
aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the affected area showed neuronal reduction,
degeneration with eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions, perivascular
lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and gliosis. Electron microscopy of the
intranuclear inclusions revealed fine, fibrillar, tubular nucleocapsids,
consistent with the measles virus. CONCLUSION: Acute measles encephalitis
(AME), subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), and SME are the three CNS
syndromes associated with measles infection. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) antibody titres against measles virus are usually high and helpful in the
diagnosis of AME and SSPE. In SME, neither serum nor CSF antibody titres
against measles are high. Therefore, FNAB is necessary for a definitive
diagnosis.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Twenty-seven patients with acute monosymptomatic optic neuritis were
randomly selected from a population-based cohort of patients extensively
screened for known etiologies of ON. Paired serum and CSF obtained median 20
days from onset were examined for oligoclonal IgG, free kappa and free lambda
chains, and virus-specific oligoclonal IgG antibodies by an affinity-mediated
capillary blot technique. CSF-restricted oligoclonal IgG bands, free kappa and
free lambda chain bands were observed in 17, 15 and nine patients,
respectively. In addition, 16 patients showed a polyspecific intrathecal
synthesis of oligoclonal IgG antibodies against one or more viruses (12
measles, nine varicella zoster, six rubella, six mumps) compared to all the 18
examined patients with definite multiple sclerosis (P = 0.0014). The presence
of virus-specific oligoclonal IgG was significantly related to the results of
oligoclonal IgG (P = 0.0034), free kappa chain bands (P = 0.0020), and brain
MRI abnormalities (P = 0.0402). At 1 year follow-up five patients had developed
clinically definite multiple sclerosis; all had virus-specific oligoclonal IgG
antibodies, oligoclonal IgG and abnormal MRI at onset.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We report an autopsy-proven case of SSPE in which the course was
rapidly progressive, leading to death in 2 months. The patient was admitted for
investigation of visual symptoms. His examination revealed complete right
homonymous hemianopia and myoclonic jerks in the right half of the body. EEG
showed high voltage periodic slow-wave discharges that were often associated
with jerks. Measles antibody was positive in serum and CSF. MRI showed
hyperintensity in the white matter of the occipital poles. The patient became
completely blind and had jerks in all four limbs. His condition continued to
deteriorate and within 3 weeks he reached a state of deep coma. The myoclonic
jerks became less marked and gradually completely ceased. The EEG showed
diffuse slow activity without periodic complexes. The patient died
approximately 2 months from onset of disease. Brain autopsy revealed severe
neuronal loss with abundant inclusion bodies in the remaining neuronal and
oligodendroglial nuclei, which was compatible with SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  OBJECTIVE: To determine if there is evidence for a causal
relationship between acute encephalopathy followed by permanent brain injury or
death associated with the administration of further attenuated measles vaccines
(Attenuvax or Lirugen, Hoechst Marion Roussel, Kansas City, MO), mumps vaccine
(Mumpsvax, Merck and Co, Inc, West Point, PA), or rubella vaccines (Meruvax or
Meruvax II, Merck and Co, Inc, West Point, PA), combined measles and rubella
vaccine (M-R-Vax or M-R-Vax II, Merck and Co, Inc, West Point, PA), or combined
measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (M-M-R or M-M-R II, Merck and Co, Inc, West
Point, PA), the lead author reviewed claims submitted to the National Vaccine
Injury Compensation Program. METHODS: The medical records of children who met
the inclusion criteria of receiving the first dose of these vaccines between
1970 and 1993 and who developed such an encephalopathy with no determined cause
within 15 days were identified and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 48 children,
ages 10 to 49 months, met the inclusion criteria after receiving measles
vaccine, alone or in combination. Eight children died, and the remainder had
mental regression and retardation, chronic seizures, motor and sensory
deficits, and movement disorders. The onset of neurologic signs or symptoms
occurred with a nonrandom, statistically significant distribution of cases on
days 8 and 9. No cases were identified after the administration of monovalent
mumps or rubella vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: This clustering suggests that a causal
relationship between measles vaccine and encephalopathy may exist as a rare
complication of measles immunization.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The cytoplasmic tail of the measles virus (MV) fusion (F) protein is
often altered in viruses which spread through the brain of patients suffering
from subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). We transferred the coding
regions of F tails from SSPE viruses in an MV genomic cDNA. Similarly, we
constructed and transferred mutated tail-encoding regions of the other viral
glycoprotein hemagglutinin (H) gene. From the mutated genomic cDNAs, we
achieved rescue of viruses that harbor different alterations of the F tail,
deletions in the membrane-distal half of the H tail, and combinations of these
mutations. Viruses with alterations in any of the tails spread rapidly through
the monolayer via enhanced cell-cell fusion. Double-tail mutants had even
higher fusion competence but slightly decreased infectivity. Analysis of the
protein composition of released mutant viral particles indicated that the tails
are necessary for accurate virus envelope assembly and suggested a direct F
tail-matrix (M) protein interaction. Since even tail-altered glycoproteins
colocalized with M protein in intracellular patches, additional interactions
may exist. We conclude that in MV infections, including SSPE, the glycoprotein
tails are involved not only in virus envelope assembly but also in the control
of virus-induced cell fusion.<p>

to 20%. Sequence analysis revealed frequent mutations in the corresponding

ABSTRACT:  Post-traumatic Meniere's disease is a true clinical entity based on
clinical observations and histopathologic study. The traumatic insult may be a
blow to the head, a temporal bone fracture, infectious sequelae of measles,
mumps, syphilis, or even acoustic trauma. Although there are many cases of
Meniere's disease for which no definite etiologic agent can be identified, a
detailed clinical history is the only way to identify possible etiologic causes
for Meniere's disease. In all forms of post-traumatic Meniere's disease, the
symptoms manifest in a delayed fashion following the insult, usually years.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Acute measles is a classic infectious disease of childhood with
worldwide distribution. Its causative agent, measles virus (MV), is an
efficient pathogen, persisting in nature in populations large enough to support
it, even though it is able to cause an acute infection in any individual only
once in his lifetime. The characteristic clinical hallmarks of measles, fever
and rash, coincide with antiviral immune response. MV-specific T lymphocyte and
antibody responses contribute to virus clearance and protection from
reinfection, respectively. Concomitant with immune activation immunologic
abnormalities arise during MV infection. The ensuing suppression of cellular
immune responses is presumably responsible for increased susceptibility to
other infections. Additionally, central nervous system (CNS) complications of
MV infection with different pathogenesis occur. Autoimmune disease may appear
in the form of acute measles encephalomyelitis. Furthermore, MV may persist in
the CNS in rare cases without periodic shedding of infectious virus. Measles
inclusion body encephalitis can develop on the basis of inadequate
virus-specific cell-mediated immune responses and subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis occurs many years after primary measles as a slow virus
infection. Host cell factors operating in cells of the CNS together with
mutations particularly in genes coding for viral envelope proteins initiate and
maintain the persistent state of infection with a viral replication cycle that
is attenuated at the transcriptional and translational level.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Rubella virus is a single-stranded, plus-sense RNA virus belonging
to the Togaviridae family. Rubella virus infection causes a benign disease
known as rubella or German measles, however infection during early pregnancy
can lead to severe birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).
Sequelae of rubella virus infection include three distinct neurological
syndromes: a postinfectious encephalitis following acute infection, a spectrum
of neurological manifestations following congenital infection, and an extremely
rare neurodegenerative disorder, progressive rubella panencephalitis (PRP),
that can follow either congenital or postnatal infection. The pathogenesis of
all three of these syndromes is incompletely understood. Virus invasion and
replication in the brain has only been definitively demonstrated in CRS and
appears to account for the majority of neurological lesions observed in this
disease. Immune-mediated pathology is particularly evident in PRP and may be
autoimmune in nature, possibly triggered by molecular mimicry between viral and
host epitopes, considering the apparent lack of virus in the brain. The
pathogenesis of rubella encephalitis following acute infection has not been
determined.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In a healthy 49-year-old man, a decrease in job efficiency was
noticed along with bizarre behavior. On admission, he was euphoric, childish,
superficial and had increased libido. Neurological findings were normal. There
were no abnormal findings on routine blood tests, hematochemistry or urine
analysis. MRI showed no abnormal findings. However, single photon emission CT
(SPECT) showed diffuse hypoaccummulation of tracer from the temporal to frontal
regions. Lumbar puncture showed clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with
pleocytosis and an elevated protein level. Moreover, antibody IgG titers to
herpes simplex virus (HSV) and measles virus were elevated, according to EIA
[serum HSV -1,202.2x, measles virus 47.1x: CSF HSV-116.1x, measles virus 9.9x].
The ratio of serum to CSF antibody titers of HSV and measles virus were 12.5
and 4.75, respectively. The antibody index values of HSV and measles virus IgG
titers were 8.42 and 22.22. The ratio of albumin was 105.7. Chronic,
progressive HSV encephalitis is rare, and there have been very few reports of
encephalitis due to double infection by HSV and another virus. Our patient was
diagnosed as having encephalitis due to double infection with HSV and measles
virus, because the ratio of serum to CSF antibody titers was less than 20 and
the antibody index values were over 1.91. Moreover, since the IgG index was
elevated and the ratio of albumin was not low, it was suggested that the
blood-brain-barrier had not been disrupted, and antibodies were being produced
chronically in the medullary cavity. Hyperaccummulation of tracer on SPECT
studies has been reported in the early stages of HSV encephalitis. In our case,
while CT and MRI showed no abnormal findings, SPECT showed diffuse
hypoaccummulation. SPECT appears to be a useful tool in the diagnosis of this
disorder. In case of chronic, progressive personality change in middle-aged
adults, we must be aware of double virus infection of the brain as a possible
causal factor.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Immunoglobulin (Ig) G was purified from soluble and membrane
fractions of postmortem subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) brain,
multiple sclerosis (MS) brain plaque-periplaque white matter, and normal human
brain (NHB) white matter. After homogenization in 0.32 M sucrose and removal of
cell debris and nuclei by low-speed centrifugation, soluble and crude membrane
fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation. After removal of sucrose by
dialysis, IgG was isolated from the soluble fraction by protein A affinity
chromatography. IgG was obtained from the membrane fraction by elution at low
pH and purification from the eluate by protein A chromatography. Whereas very
little IgG was in NHB white matter, significant levels of IgG were recovered
from both SSPE and MS brain. Both immunocytochemical staining of measles
virus-infected cells in tissue culture and protein immunoblotting of
virus-infected cell lysates showed that the IgG from SSPE brain contained
activity specific for measles virus protein. The abundance, purity and
functional activity of IgG extracted from SSPE and MS brain indicate that IgG
extracted from the brain of humans with an inflammatory disease of unknown
etiology can be used to identify its corresponding antigen.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A small plaque mutant with reduced neurovirulence in newborn mice
was obtained from Edmonston strain measles virus after propagation for 5 months
in NIH3T3 cells. It retained the antigenicity of the parental virus and tended
to induce higher neutralizing antibody titers in the adult BALB/c mice. The
intracerebral (but not intraperitoneal) inoculation of the live mutant virus
one day before prevented the newborn BALB/c mice from encephalitis caused by
the intracerebral challenge with the parental strain at a dose of 10-20 LD50.
The intracerebral inoculation with the mutant virus whose replication capacity
was inactivated by UV-irradiation was ineffective. The protection was not
attributed to interferons nor to viral interference. The mechanism remains
unknown.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We describe a 3-year-old boy with subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE) who died 4 months after its onset. His initial symptoms
were drowsiness and left hemiplegia. He became comatose in 10 days, and
developed a decortical posture after 45 days. He suffered from multiple
cerebral hemorrhage and infarction 3 months later. Oligodendrocytes were
positively stained by immunocytochemical stain with a complement-fixing measles
antibody. Light microscopy revealed glial nodules, perivascular cuffing and
reactive gliosis. Small arteries showed intimal thickening with resultant
occlusion and occasional recanalization. These findings suggested vascular
involvement in SSPE. This case illustrates the difference between the fulminant
and chronic forms of SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In this study we investigated pathological changes of the expression
of the measles virus (MV) receptor, CD46, in subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE) brains. We analyzed CD46 expression in lesions of brain
specimens from five SSPE patients in comparison to uninfected regions of the
same brains and to normal human brains. The correlation between CD46 and MV
infection, in individual cells in SSPE brains, was analyzed by double-staining
procedures using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and in situ hybridization to
detect MV-specific mRNAs. We found that CD46 was expressed at relatively low
levels by neurons and astrocytes in normal brains in comparison to
neuroblastoma and astrocytoma cell lines. Within heavily infected (MV-positive)
brain lesions of all five SSPE cases, CD46 was either not detected or was
expressed to a lesser degree by neural cells, irrespective of whether MV
antigens were detectable or not. In contrast, normal levels of CD46 were found
in SSPE brain tissue distant from the lesion. Using in situ hybridization,
mRNAs of both MV nucleocapsid and MV hemagglutinin (MV-H) were detected in all
SSPE lesions, while no or only small amounts of MV-H protein were detected.
MV-infected neurons were never found to express CD46. Although a strict
correlation between levels of the MV-H protein and the absence CD46 could not
be seen, these findings suggest that the CD46 expression is reduced by the MV
infection in lesions of SSPE brains.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The EEG of a 12-year-old girl with stage II subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE), who had also suffered from a non-progressive mental
retardation of unknown aetiology since early childhood, revealed periodic
generalised stereotyped fast wave bursts synchronous with myoclonic jerks. The
background activity was nearly normal. The diagnosis of SSPE was established by
raised serum and measles antibody titres, raised CSF IgG, and brain biopsy.
This rare type of periodic complex has only once been described in the
literature, again in a mentally retarded child who had developed SSPE. We
suggest a mechanism of origin of this type of periodic complex drawn from
observations in these two cases, and discuss its significance.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Measles virus can give three different forms of infections in the
central nervous system. These are acute postinfectious encephalitis, acute
progressive infectious encephalitis, and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis
(SSPE). The postinfectious acute disease is interpreted to reflect an
autoimmune reaction. The acute progressive form of brain disease, also referred
to as inclusion body encephalitis, reflects a direct attack by the virus under
conditions of yielding cellmediated immunity. The late progressive form of
encephalitis (SSPE) has been extensively analyzed. Recent molecular genetic
studies have unravelled a range of mechanisms by which a defective expression
of either the matrix, the fusion, or the hemagglutinin proteins may lead to
viral persistence in brain cells under conditions not allowing identification
by immune surveillance mechanisms. Many aspects of virus-cell interactions have
been examined by use of explant cultures of neuronal cells of human and animal
origin. Some of the findings are reviewed. Experimental animals, in particular
rodents, have been used to establish systems in which phenomena, pivotal to the
evolution of acute as well as persistent measles virus infections in the brain,
can be studied. A wide range of potentially important mechanisms has been
highlighted and is discussed. More recently, mice with genetic defects in
immune functions were used to evaluate consequences as to initiation and
dissemination of virus infection in the brain.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The spread of measles virus into the brain was studied exploiting
the olfactory pathway, which represents an important route of neuroinvasion by
viruses. The virus was injected into the main olfactory bulb of wild-type mice
and mice with disrupted TAP1 gene (TAP refers to the Transporter associated
with Antigen Presentation), which codes for products essential for the
cell-mediated immune response. Virus invasion was monitored for 4 weeks by
immunohistochemistry. The distribution of measles virus was found to be
restricted to brain areas connected with the olfactory bulbs. However, in the
wild-type mice there was a marked infiltration of lymphocytes in the infected
brain structures, and the virus did not pass beyond the piriform cortex. In the
TAP1 -/- mice the virus spread more extensively along olfactory projections
into the limbic system and monoaminergic brainstem neurons. Infected mice of
both types developed seizures, which may have been focally evoked from the
piriform cortex. This study provides evidence that measles virus can spread
through axonal pathways in the brain. The findings obtained in the
gene-manipulated mice point out that a compromised immune state of the host may
potentiate targeting of virus to the limbic system through olfactory
projections.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis virus has been isolated with
difficulty from brains of infected patients. More strains are needed for the
study of the pathogenesis of this virus. To make the isolation more efficient,
we selected portions to be examined from the brains of three patients with
reference to findings of repeated magnetic resonance and computed tomographic
imaging. Three cell lines susceptible to measles virus field strains were used.
In all three cases viruses were isolated most effectively from recent lesions
and with Vero cells. Our results suggested that these imaging methods and Vero
cells could be used for improvement in the efficiency of isolation of this
virus from patient brains.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The extent of apoptotic cell death was examined in central nervous
system (CNS) tissues from three cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis
(SSPE). Apoptosis was demonstrated by in situ end-labelling of DNA in
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Measles virus and cell types
were labelled by immunohistochemistry and/or in situ hybridization.
Furthermore, bcl-2 expression in SSPE was examined by immunohistochemistry. All
three cases exhibited varying degrees of apoptosis in all CNS areas studied.
Brain tissue from a non-neurological control case did not show any significant
apoptosis. Characterization of cell types demonstrated neurons,
oligodendrocytes, lymphocytes and microglia undergoing apoptosis. A linear
relationship could not be established between virus burden and the extent of
apoptosis in any particular area. Virus-negative cells were observed which were
undergoing apoptosis. Bcl-2 immunoreactivity in SSPE was confined to the
infiltrating cell population. These results suggest that apoptosis of various
cell types may contribute to the neuropathogenesis of measles virus infection
in the human CNS, either as a direct effect of viral infection or by
cytokine-mediated responses.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Measles virus (MV) persistence in brain cells has broad effects on
different cellular functions. We have previously shown that NS20Y clone,
originally derived from C1300 neuroblastoma cells, persistently infected with
MV (NS20Y/MS), displays constitutively elevated levels of c-fos and PKC mRNAs,
implying MV-mediated effects on transcriptional regulation. Nonetheless, the
mode by which virus affects the transcriptional machinery still remains
obscure. In order to define this phenomenon, we studied the binding properties
of major transcription factors (AP-1 and NFkappaB) in NS20Y/MS cells. Using
electrophoretic mobility shift approach (EMSA) with the appropriate
oligonucleotide probes, we have found that the persistent MV infection does not
affect NFkappaB binding, while the AP-1 binding was significantly decreased.
Similar inhibition was not observed in NS20Y cells acutely infected with MV.
Anti-measles antibody-mediated restriction of viral gene expression restored
AP-1 binding, thus suggesting that measles virus proteins may affect the
components of the host transcriptional machinery.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Viral infections of the nervous system make up a wide range of
disorders with a mainly benign outcome. However, in some cases there is severe,
morbimortality. In viral encephalitis there is direct involvement of the brain
parenchyma which is seen clinically as reduced consciousness, convulsions
and/or focal neurological deficit. The especial attraction of some viruses for
particular cells or structures determines the variety of clinical findings. The
incidence and frequency of the various agents depends on several factors
(geographical location of a certain virus, age and general health of the
population concerned, etc.). In areas free of arbovirus the commonest
aetiologies are; varicella, herpes simplex, parotiditis and enterovirus. Modern
treatment (transplants, chemotherapy) of previously fatal diseases and the AIDS
epidemic have increased the number of immunodeficient patients; the population
is susceptible to viral infections of the nervous system which are infrequent
(e.g. cytomegalovirus, papovavirus) or which follow a different course (e.g.
measles, enteroviruses) to that in immunocompetent patients. Specific
conditions are reviewed. Improvement in the general health and sanitation of
the population, and the universal use and development of new vaccines will
significantly reduce the incidence of viral encephalitis. Improved prognosis
will be related to the use of modern laboratory techniques which permit early,
sensitive, specific diagnosis and the development of antiviral agents.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is mainly thought of as a
disorder of childhood and adolescence and may not be readily recognized when
presenting later in life. Prior reports have suggested that adult-onset SSPE
may have atypical features. We have added two cases to the existing literature
on adult-onset SSPE, compared them with a more classic juvenile presentation,
and extensively reviewed those reports that were published after the
etiological link with the measles virus had been established. Adult-onset SSPE
patients present at a mean age of 25.4 years (range 20-35 years). They have a
higher proportion of either negative history of measles exposure or
undocumented history by the reporting authors. Those with available history of
measles exposure tend to have it either earlier (younger than 3 years old) or
later (after 9 years) than the usual childhood measles infection. Where the
primary infection is known, unusually long measles-to-SSPE intervals have been
documented, ranging from 14 to 22 years. None of the cases followed measles
vaccination. Visual symptomatology was very frequent, with 8 of the 13 cases
reviewed having a purely ophthalmological presentation; only 2 patients
presented with behavioral changes. Although the course of the disease was
progressive and fatal in the majority, there appeared to be a higher rate of
spontaneous remission as compared with childhood-onset SSPE. Myoclonus, spastic
hemiparesis, bradykinesia, and rigidity were the predominant motor
manifestations. Neuropathology revealed cortical and subcortical gray matter
involvement preferentially of the occipital lobes, thalamus, and putamen. The
importance of recognizing the spectrum of potential presentations of SSPE and
providing an early diagnosis will increase as more effective treatments become
available.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We have examined the in situ transcription of leukaemia inhibitory
factor (LIF) in brain tissue from 3 cases of subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE) and in 2 non-neurological control brains. This has been
compared with expression of interleukin 2 (IL-2), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and
tumour necrosis factor beta (TNF beta) in the same tissues. All of the
cytokines in the study were expressed in cells in the inflammatory infiltrate
as well as in glial cells. LIF mRNA was also found to be expressed in neurons,
in foci where these cells were also virally infected. No hybridization was
found with any of the probes in areas of SSPE brain, which were negative for
measles virus RNA or in the non-neurological control cases, although expression
was demonstrated in the latter by use of reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR). Differentiated, cultured human neuronal cells were also
positive, by RT-PCR, for LIF. This is the first demonstration of LIF expression
in human brain and the results suggest that this cytokine is up-regulated, in
several cell types, including neurons, following virus infection.<p>

ABSTRACT:  AIMS: To determine the specificity of persistent measles virus
infection in intestinal samples from Crohn's disease patients using
quantitative immunogold electron microscopy. To compare the results with
samples from ulcerative colitis, a granulomatous inflammatory control
(tuberculous lymphadenitis), and a positive control. METHODS: Formalin fixed,
paraffin embedded intestinal tissue from patients with Crohn's disease was
reprocessed and stained with antimeasles nucleocaspid protein primary antibody
followed by 10 nm gold conjugated secondary antibody. Tissue samples were taken
from granulomatous and non-granulomatous areas of the intestine. Intestinal
samples from patients with ulcerative colitis, tuberculous lymphadenitis, or
acute mesenteric ischaemia were similarly processed. Brain tissue from a
patient with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) was used as the
positive control. Duplicate sections of all tissues were processed without the
primary antibody. Stained specimens were examined by electron microscopy.
RESULTS: In Crohn's disease patients, 8/9 foci of granulomatous inflammation
and 0/4 foci of non-specific inflammation were positive for measles virus. Of
controls, 0/5 non-inflamed intestinal tissues, 1/8 tuberculous tissues, 1/5
ulcerative colitis tissues, and 1/1 SSPE tissues were positive. Gold grain
counts per nuclear field-of-view in both Crohn's disease granulomas (43.29) and
SSPE (36.94) were significantly higher than in tissues from patients with
ulcerative colitis (13.52) or tuberculous lymphadenitis (15.875), and
nongranulomatous areas of Crohn's disease (4.89) (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.001, p
= 0.0006, respectively), with no significant difference between Crohn's disease
and SSPE (p &gt; 0.1). In both SSPE and Crohn's disease staining was confined
to a small population of cells exhibiting characteristic cytopathology.
CONCLUSION: These data support a role for measles virus in the aetiology of
Crohn's disease.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In an autopsy study of HIV-infected children in Abidjan, Cote
d'Ivoire, the neuropathology of 76 HIV-1- and 2 HIV-2-positive children was
compared with that of 77 frequency-matched HIV-negative children, in whom the
systemic pathology was also known. Seventy of the 78 HIV-seropositive children
were confirmed as HIV-infected, as determined by combined serology, IgA Western
blots and clinicopathological criteria. The HIV-negative children showed a high
background level (n = 49, 64%) of neuropathological abnormalities, including
nonspecific inflammatory infiltrates, micromineralization, and bacterial and
lymphocytic meningitis. In the HIV-positive children, HIV encephalitis was
found in 4 (6%), cytomegalovirus in 2 (3%), toxoplasmosis in 3 (4%) and measles
encephalitis in one (1%). Bacterial meningitis was equally common in both
groups, but cerebral malaria was less common (n = 2, 3%) in HIV-positive than
in HIV-negative children (n = 11, 14%). The low prevalence of HIV encephalitis
may reflect comparatively early death in HIV infection in Africa as compared
with our experience in Europe and the US.<p>

ABSTRACT:  This is a case report of a 10-year-old boy with subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE). He initially developed visual disturbance and macular
degenerative changes of the right eye at the age of 8 years, followed by
chorioretinitis of the left eye, and his neurological symptoms deteriorated
rapidly from the age of 10 years. He was diagnosed as having SSPE, as judged on
cerebrospinal fluid examination for measles virus RNA by reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), at the second stage of
Jabbour's classification on admission. Although high intensity lesions were
observed in the right occipital and temporal lobes, especially around the optic
radiation, on T2-weighted brain MRI before the start of intrathecal
interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy, they had disappeared at about two months
after the treatment. Chorioretinitis (and/or macular degeneration) should be
considered in the differential diagnosis of SSPE, permitting early IFN
therapy.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a persistent viral
infection of the central nervous system due to a defective measles virus.
Beginning with progressive cognitive malfunctioning, myoclonus and other less
specific neurologic signs and symptoms, it usually evolves to a vegetative,
decorticated state and death. Disease course and characteristics can be highly
variable. Since the widespread measles vaccination in the Western countries
started in the late seventies and early eighties, the incidence of SSPE has
dropped significantly. Also adult onset is more frequently seen which changes
the field of differential diagnosis. In this article 3 atypical cases of SSPE
are described with peculiarities such as adult onset, pronounced extrapyramidal
involvement, remission and prolonged disease course. Common features of the
disease are emphasized to enable accurate diagnosis which is based on clinical
features, presence of high titers of serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSE)
measles antibodies, MRI and EEG.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Prevention of virus-related neurological diseases are surveyed.
Patients of poliomyelitis has recently been drastically reduced by world-wide
administrating live vaccines. In view of rare incidence of paralysis after
giving live vaccine, adoption of inactivated vaccine has recently been
reconsidered. A live varicella vaccine was developed and has been world-wide
used for normal and high-risk children. Incidence of zoster in vaccinated acute
leukemic children is several times higher in those who with rash after
vaccination as compared with those without rash, and as no or few rash appears
after vaccination of normal children, it is expected that vaccination of normal
children would lead to reduction of zoster after their aging. Measles
encephalitis has rapidly been reduced by world-wide use of live vaccines.
Mouse-brain derived vaccine against Japanese encephalitis(JE) has been used in
Asian countries. Development of tissue-culture derived JE vaccine is under
way.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is one of the most
important slow virus infection caused by measles virus in human. It have passed
over 20 years since measles virus was found in the brain of SSPE patients.
However, definite etiological mechanism is still unknown. In Japan, number of
SSPE patients are gradually decreasing, but over 5 patients are reported every
year. Recently, the age of onset of SSPE became higher, incubation period from
measles to SSPE onset became to be more prolonged, and serum measles antibody
titers became lower than before. From typical clinical findings, serum and CSF
measles antibody titers and periodic complex high voltage slow waves with
suppression burst, SSPE is suggested. It is not so difficult to make diagnosis.
As the differential diagnosis, epilepsy, brain tumor, metabolic diseases, or
psychological disorders are mentioned. Treatment for SSPE is still
undetermined. At present, it is thought that combined treatment of oral
inosinpranobex (isoprinosine) and intratechal or intraventricular interferon
(IFN) administration is the most effective.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) are the major slow virus infections of
humans. SSPE is caused by mutant measles virus after long persistence in the
brain. Its pathogenesis is discussed, based on accumulating data on molecular
properties on measles virus prevalent in the field as well as recent
identification of measles virus receptor. Current situation on the therapy of
SSPE is also described. PML is caused by the infection of oligodendroglia with
persisting JC virus. Its pathogenesis is discussed based on the molecular
properties of the archetype and PML type of JC virus, and on the recent
findings on the involvement of JC virus T antigen in demyelination. Increase in
the incidence of PML in patients with AIDS is discussed in view of the
interactions between HIV and JC virus.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In addition to the rash, fever, and upper respiratory tract
congestion that are the hallmarks of acute measles virus (MV) infection,
invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) can occur, establishing a
persistent infection primarily in neurons. The recent identification of the
human membrane glycoprotein, CD46, as the MV receptor allowed for the
establishment of transgenic mice in which the CD46 gene was transcriptionally
regulated by a neuron-specific promoter. Expression of the measles receptor
rendered primary CD46-positive neurons permissive to infection with
MV-Edmonston. Notably, viral transmission within these cultures occurred in the
absence of extracellular virus, presumably via neuronal processes. No infection
was seen in nontransgenic mice inoculated intracerebrally with MV-Edmonston. In
contrast, scattered neurons were infected following inoculation of transgenic
adults, and an impressive widespread neuronal infection was established in
transgenic neonates. The neonatal infection resulted in severe CNS disease by
3-4 weeks after infection. Illness was characterized initially by awkward gait
and a lack of mobility, and in later stages seizures leading to death. These
results show that expression of the MV receptor on specific murine cells
(neurons) in vivo is absolutely essential to confer both susceptibility to
infection and neurologic disease by this human virus. The disparity in clinical
findings between neonatal and adult transgenic mice indicates that differences
exist between the developing and mature CNS with respect to MV infection and
pathogenesis.<p>

ABSTRACT:  INTRODUCTION: Prophylactic immunization against measles, rubella and
mumps is carried out using a trivalent vaccine. The second dose is recommended
at 11-12 years-old. Neurological complications have been described after
vaccination for measles and rubella. All cases occurred several days after
vaccination. CLINICAL CASES: We describe four girls aged between 10 and 11
years old who were vaccinated on the same day. Almost immediately they
complained of symptoms in the vaccinated arm. These were pain, paresthesia,
coldness, pallor and sweating of the hand. On the following days there was loss
of strength and alterations in sensation. All laboratory, radiological,
neurophysiological and psychiatric studies were normal. Immunological study
showed changes in the immunohumeral response to the vaccine. Complete recovery
was made. CONCLUSIONS: The different types of post-vaccination complications
described to date are reviewed, together with conditions showing features such
as those described, particularly the reflex sympathetic syndrome. Possible
reasons for the poor immunohumoral response to the vaccine in these patients
are discussed.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence of the H gene of 75 measles
virus (MV) strains (32 published and 43 new sequences) was carried out. The
lineage groups described from comparison of the nucleotide sequences encoding
the C-terminal regions of the N protein of MV were the same as those derived
from the H gene sequences in almost all cases. The databases document a number
of distinct genotype switches that have occurred in Madrid (Spain).
Well-documented is the complete replacement of lineage group C2, the common
European genotype at that time, with that of group D3 around the autumn of
1993. No further isolations of group C2 took place in Madrid after this time.
The rate of mutation of the H gene sequences of MV genotype D3 circulating in
Madrid from 1993 to 1996 was very low (5 x 10(-4) per annum for a given
nucleotide position). This is an order of magnitude lower than the rates of
mutation observed in the HN genes of human influenza A viruses. The ratio of
expressed over silent mutations indicated that the divergence was not driven by
immune selection in this gene. Variations in amino acid 117 of the H protein (F
or L) may be related to the ability of some strains to haemagglutinate only in
the presence of salt. Adaptation of MV to different primate cell types was
associated with very small numbers of mutations in the H gene. The changes
could not be predicted when virus previously grown in human B cell lines was
adapted to monkey Vero cells. In contrast, rodent brain-adapted viruses
displayed a lot of amino acid sequence variation from normal MV strains. There
was no convincing evidence for recombination between MV genotypes.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Plaque-periplaque areas from MS brain tissue were explanted and
propagated in tissue culture. The same in vitro techniques that successfully
rescued measles virus from SSPE brain, papovavirus from PML brain, and HSV from
normal human trigeminal ganglia, were applied. MS brain cells were also
inoculated into chimpanzees, multiple rodent species, and embryonated hens
eggs. No neurologic disease developed in experimentally infected animals, and
no cytopathic effect was observed in explanted cells, or after cocultivation or
fusion of MS brain cells with indicator cells. Further analysis of explanted
and cocultivated cells by indirect immunofluorescence with various antiviral
antisera prepared against viruses associated with post-infectious
encephalomyelitis, as well as antisera to other ubiquitous viruses, failed to
detect viral antigen. Finally, attempts to detect a latent enveloped virus in
MS brain cells by 'superinfecting' MS brain cells in culture with vesicular
stomatitis virus (VSV) did not reveal a VSV non-neutralizable fraction.
Nevertheless, since oligoclonal bands (OGBs) in the CSF of patients with
chronic infectious diseases of the CNS are directed against the causative
agent, it is likely that OGBs in MS CSF are antibody directed against the agent
or antigen that triggered disease. Although the relevant antibody may be scarce
relative to irrelevant antibody in MS CSF, and only small amounts of an
MS-specific antigen may be present in brain, this report provides a rationale
for strategies proposed in our companion report by Owens et al which will allow
detection of an MS-specific antigen or its cognate RNA in brain.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Nine patients below 20 years of age (4 males and 5 females), who
were diagnosed to have acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) by clinical
findings and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were reviewed retrospectively.
They ranged from 4 months to 20 years of age with an average of 8.6 years.
Seven patients (78%) received neurophysiological studies, which included
electroencephalography, multimodality evoked potentials (EPs), nerve conduction
velocity and/or F-wave measurement. The presentation symptoms were mainly
headache, vomiting, consciousness change and motor deficits. Seven (78%) of
nine patients had symptoms preceded by fever or upper respiratory tract
infections; one (11%) was preceded by trivalent mumps, measles, rubella
vaccination and no definite predisposing factor was found in another. Computed
tomography (CT) scans were abnormal in five (71 %) of seven children, while MRI
showed multiple lesions in seven (78%) of nine children. The lesions in MRI
were mainly in the brainstem (n = 6), basal ganglion (n = 5), thalamus (n = 4),
periventricular white matter (n = 4) and cerebellum (n = 4). EPs disclosed
spinal cord involvement in all patients who received the examination.
Peripheral neuropathy was disclosed in one patient. It was concluded that
associated radiculoneuropathy is possible in patients with ADEM. Both MRI and
neurophysiologic studies are complementary for diagnosis of ADEM.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive, slow
virus infection of the brain, caused by the measles virus, attacking children
and young adults. We investigated 15 patients with SSPE by MRI, with 5 normal
and 10 pathological results. In the early period, lesions were in the grey
matter and subcortical white matter. They were asymmetrical and had a
predilection for the posterior parts of the hemispheres. Later, high-signal
changes in deep white matter and severe cerebral atrophy were observed.
Parenchymal lesions significantly correlated with the duration of disease. A
significant relationship between MRI findings and clinical stage was observed
in the 1st year of the disease.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We report a 15 year old girl with a childhood hemiplegia, who
developed a recent progressive intellectual decline associated with elevated
globulins and measles antibody titres in the cerebrospinal fluid, indicating a
diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). The magnetic resonance
imaging revealed left hemispheric atrophy concordant with a long-standing right
hemiplegia, and electroencephalography exhibited lateralized periodic complexes
(PCs) over the right hemisphere concordant with left-sided myoclonic jerks. The
modification of PCs in our patient due to preexisting damaged cerebral
hemisphere illustrate that a fairly functional cortex and subcortical white
matter are needed for the expression of the PCs of SSPE.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We have studied the relationship between measles virus and the
accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated tau (PHF-tau) in nine cases of
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). By assessing the presence of viral
intranuclear inclusions and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in each case, we
found no correlation between presence and amount of measles virus and the
numbers of neurons containing PHF-tau. Immunohistochemical double labeling in a
case with long duration of disease and severe histopathologic change revealed
no strict colocalization of measles virus antigen and PHF-tau throughout
different brain regions. In areas containing both antigens, most neurons
carrying measles virus did not have a tangle and vice versa, eventhough some
colocalization beyond that expected by chance was observed in specific cortical
areas. These results indicate that, although secondary to viral infection, NFT
formation in SSPE is not restricted to cells carrying viral antigen.
Conversely, measles virus infected cells do not necessarily accumulate PHF-tau.
This lack of colocalization at the cellular level, throughout different brain
areas and among different cases suggests that the formation of NFT in SSPE is
not directly induced by the infectious agent. The formation of NFT in this
disease appears to be elicited through a specific type of tissue damage and,
thus, to be an epiphenomenon. This pathogenetic detail may be of interest for
our understanding of the role of neurofibrillary degeneration in the
pathogenesis of other more frequent neurodegenerative diseases with
cytoskeletal pathology.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Most chronic headache syndromes can be identified by conducting a
careful interview that yields a thorough understanding of the patient's
headache experience. The interview should explore the PQRST of the pain:
provocation, quality, region, strength and time course, with the last element
being the most helpful. Associated symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting in
migraine, can be clues to the etiology. A list of all current medicines and the
frequency of use should be obtained, since overuse of various analgesics can
convert paroxysmal migraine into chronic daily headache. Psychosocial issues
should be addressed, since depression can manifest as chronic headache. Changes
in mood, energy, appetite, sleep, libido, enjoyments and suicidal ideation
(represented by the acronym MEASLES) can indicate depression. A neurologic
examination is important, and any focal findings warrant tomographic imaging of
the brain. Findings on physical examination, however, are usually normal in
patients with chronic headache. Laboratory and imaging studies are of most
value when targeted to elucidate potential diagnoses raised by the detailed
interview.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A total of 21 patients with postmeasles and 26 patients with
postvaricella C.N.S. complications were studied. In both groups, males were
predominant than females. The C.N.S. manifestations included disturbed level of
consciousness, coma, seizures, motor deficits, ataxia and myoclonus. The
sequelae were more frequent in postmeasles cases and ranged from behavioral
abnormalities to motor deficits. C.S.F. examination showed that most of the
cases demonstrated increase in the protein content (45-100mg) and pleocytosis.
Myelin protein was detected in 8 samples and 6 samples of postmeasles and
varicella C.S.F. out of 12 samples in Tested in each group. Specific virus IgG
antibody was detected significantly in 8 paired C.S.F. samples of postvaricella
group and only one sample of postmeasles out of 12 paired samples tested in
each group. C-T. scan examination revealed that the most common finding was the
brain oedema (13 in measles, and 21 in varicella group).<p>

ABSTRACT:  Microwave irradiation was investigated as a pretreatment to in situ
hybridization on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Two probe/tissue
systems were used: a single-stranded RNA probe for the detection of measles
virus nucleocapsid genome in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis brain tissue,
and a double stranded DNA probe for chicken anaemia virus in thymus of chicken
infected with the virus. Microwaving, when used as sole pretreatment, was not
as effective as the more traditional enzyme pretreatments for in situ
hybridization. However, when used in combination with existing pretreatments, a
significant increase was found in hybridization signal in both brain and thymus
tissue. This was emphasized when combination enzyme/microwave pretreatments
were used prior to detection of measles virus by in situ hybridization in a
series of five archival subacute sclerosing panencephalitis cases. The use of
microwave irradiation would be recommended as a means of supplementing in situ
hybridization methods, especially when using long-term formalin fixed
paraffin-embedded tissue.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In situ reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
amplification with labeled-probe hybridization (in situ RT-PCR/LPH) was used to
detect measles virus RNA within formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded brain tissue
sections from a patient who died with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis
(SSPE). Many more infected neurons and oligodendrocytes were detected by in
situ RT-PCR/LPH than by immunohistochemistry or by in situ hybridization alone.
In addition, infection of vascular endothelial cells was demonstrated only by
in situ RT-PCR/LPH. The observation that many cells contained only a few copies
of viral RNA without detectable antigen is consistent with a persistent viral
infection of the central nervous system. In situ RT-PCR/LPH, combining the
sensitivity of PCR with the tissue localization of in situ hybridization,
should prove useful in further studies to detect nucleic acids in situ in the
central nervous system.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Lack of major histocompatibility class I antigens on neurons has
been implicated as a possible mechanism for viral persistence in the brain
since these antigens are required for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte recognition of
infected cells. In subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), measles virus
(MV) persists in neurons, resulting in a fatal chronic infection. MHC class I
mRNA expression was examined in formalin-fixed brain tissue from 6 SSPE
patients by in situ hybridization. In addition MHC class I protein expression
in MV-infected neurons was examined in experimental Subacute Measles
Encephalitis (SME) by double immunohistochemistry. MHC class I mRNA expression
was found to be upregulated in SSPE tissues studied, and in 5 out of 6 cases
the expression was definitively seen on neurons. The percentage of neurons
expressing MHC class I mRNA ranged between 20 to 84% in infected areas. There
was no correlation between the degree of infection and expression of MHC class
I molecules on neurons. Importantly, the number of neurons co-expressing MHC
class I and MV antigens was markedly low, varying between 2 to 8%. Similar
results were obtained in SME where 20 to 30% of the neurons expressed MHC class
I but &lt;8% co-expressed MHC class I and MV antigens. Perivascular
infiltrating cells in the infected regions in SME expressed IFNgamma
immunoreactivity. The results suggest that MV may not be directly involved in
the induction of MHC class I on neurons and that cytokines such as IFNgamma may
play an important role. Furthermore, the paucity of neurons co-expressing MHC
class I and MV antigens in SSPE and SME suggests that such cells are either
rapidly cleared by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), or, alternatively, lack of
co-expression of MHC class I on MV infected neurons favors MV persistence in
these cells by escaping CTL recognition.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The capacity of adult human microglia to activate memory
T-lymphocyte responses to recall viral antigens in autologous peripheral blood
lymphocytes (PBL) was examined using measles and influenza viruses. Microglia
and peripheral blood macrophages were isolated form 6 patients who underwent
surgical brain biopsies. Microglial cultures readily expressed high levels of
HLA class II molecules under basal culture conditions. However, compared to
macrophages, microglia appeared to express much lower levels of CD45, a
phenotype that has been associated with the ability of rat brain
macrophage/microglia to present antigen. PBL were depleted of macrophages
(D-PBL) and the efficacy of the depletion was assessed by a reduction in the
T-cell response to concanavalin A. D-PBL were reconstituted with macrophages,
microglia, or in some cases microglia pretreated with interferon-gamma (IFN
gamma). It was observed that microglia were as efficient as macrophages in
presenting viral antigens. Pretreatment of microglia with IFN gamma did not
enhance further antigen presentation. Oligodendrocytes which lack constitutive
or inducible HLA class II molecules failed to present viral antigens. The
results have implications of the direct function of microglia as perpetuators
and possibly initiators of immune responses to virus infection in the central
nervous system compartment.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) had largely disappeared
from the United States because of nearly universal measles vaccination, but it
has reemerged in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Two
children with SSPE are described. The first was HIV positive and presented with
seizures and encephalopathy at the age of 21 months. The second developed
myoclonus and dementia at age 4 years; she was not infected with HIV, but her
mother had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging
findings were nonspecific and could have been compatible with HIV
encephalopathy. Electroencephalography was characteristic of SSPE, showing
high-voltage, periodic slow-wave complexes and background slowing. The
diagnosis of SSPE was confirmed by brain biopsy or high measles antibody titers
in the cerebrospinal fluid.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The human cell surface protein CD46 is the main measles virus (MV)
receptor. We analyzed the CD46 isoforms expressed in the brain of three
patients who died with persistent MV infections and in an unaffected brain.
Complete CD46 cDNAs were produced and found to code exclusively for CD46
isoforms with cytoplasmic tail 2. Selective expression of tail 2 isoforms was
shown in a second control brain by Western blots with antibodies specific for
each of the cytoplasmic tails. Binding of purified MV particles and
virus-dependent cell fusion were tested after transient expression of
brain-derived CD46 proteins in mouse cells. All the brain-derived proteins
mediated MV binding and virus-dependent fusion. Isoforms containing both
serine/threonine/proline (STP)-rich domains were more active in virus binding,
whereas isoforms with only one STP domain were more efficient in mediating
fusion.<p>

ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND: We used polymerase chain reaction to search for nucleic
acid sequences of several viruses in DNA and RNA extracted from brain tissues
of schizophrenic and control subjects. METHODS: We extracted DNA and RNA
templates from frozen brain specimens of 31 patients with schizophrenia and 23
nonschizophrenic control patients with other diseases. The extracts were
subjected to polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide primers for 12
different viruses (cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus
type 1, human herpesvirus type 6, varicellazoster virus, measles virus, mumps
virus, rubella virus, the picornavirus group, influenza A virus, human T-cell
lymphotropic virus type I, and St Louis encephalitis virus), several of which
have been suspected of involvement in schizophrenia. Nested primers were used
to increase the sensitivity of the method. RESULTS: No amplified nucleic acid
sequences encoded by the selected viral genomes were detected in extracts of
any brain specimens from either schizophrenic or control patients. CONCLUSIONS:
These data agree with previous studies that failed to find sequences of a
number of viruses in the cerebrospinal fluid or selected areas of the brains of
schizophrenic patients. Additional efforts should be undertaken to identify
other known and unknown pathogens in schizophrenia, sampling more areas of the
brain from subjects with a variety of clinical types of schizophrenia.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Live attenuated measles virus (MV) vaccines are ineffective in young
infants because of neutralization by maternal antibody. An immunization
strategy that may permit priming for T cell memory for MV in infants at or
shortly after birth uses recombinant bacille Calmette-Guerin expressing the
full-length MV nucleocapsid (N) protein (rBCG::N). C3H/He mice immunized with
rBCG::N developed T cell responses and ELISA antibodies to the N protein and
low levels of neutralizing antibody after intracranial infection with MV strain
CAM/R40. There was considerable reduction in the virus titer recovered from
brain homogenates, a decrease in the incidence and severity of histologic
encephalitis, and a decrease in mortality in rBCG::N-printed C3H/He mice
compared with control mice. Given the limitations of existing live attenuated
MV vaccines, these results encourage the further testing of rBCG::N vaccines in
primate models.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A digoxigenin-labelled dsDNA-probe of 287 basepairs length
complementary to the nucleoprotein-gene of canine distemper virus (CDV) was
generated by the polymerase-chain-reaction. The dsDNA-probe hybridized
specifically with base sequences of 8 different CDV strains, whereas no
hybridization was observed with a porpoise and a canine parainfluenza virus and
only a weak signal was obtained with measles virus. In formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded brain sections of 35 immunohistologically CDV antigen
positive dogs with spontaneous distemper encephalitis CDV-RNA could be detected
in 25 cases by in situ hybridization. The reason for the lack of RNA detection
in some immunohistologically positive dogs may be due to the low stability of
DNA-RNA-hybrids. Degradation of RNA by RNAses or diffusion out of autolysed
cells can not be excluded.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is a slowly progressing fatal
human disease of the central nervous system which is a delayed sequel of
measles virus (MV) infection. A typical pathological feature of this disease is
the presence of viral ribonucleocapsid structures in the form of inclusion
bodies and the absence of infectious virus or budding viral particles. The
mechanisms governing the establishment and maintenance of a persistent MV
infection in brain cells are still largely unknown. To understand the
mechanisms underlying MV persistence in neuronal cells, a tissue culture model
was studied. Clone NS20Y/MS of the murine neuroblastoma C1300 persistently
infected with the wild-type Edmonston strain of MV secretes relatively high
levels of alpha/beta interferon (IFN). As shown previously, treatment of the
persistently infected cultures with anti-IFN serum converted the persistent
state into a productive infection indicated by the appearance of multinucleated
giant cells. In this study, we have investigated whether alpha/beta IFN
produced by NS20Y/MS cells activates cellular protein tyrosine kinases which
will induce tyrosine phosphorylating activity specific to virus-infected cells.
We present data to show augmented protein tyrosine kinase activity in the
persistently infected cells. We demonstrate that the MV N protein is
phosphorylated on tyrosine in addition to serine and threonine in the
persistent state but not in NS20Y cells acutely infected with MV.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Biased hypermutation events found predominantly in the matrix gene
of measles virus isolated from persistent human CNS infections have been
attributed to the action of a cellular unwinding/modifying activity (UMA). To
define the level and distribution of this activity in brain cells, fractionated
extracts were prepared from the nuclei and cytoplasm of human glioblastoma
(D-54, U-251) and neuroblastoma (IMR-32, SKN-MC) cells and analyzed for their
ability to modify synthetic dsRNAs specific for the measles virus (MV) matrix
(M) gene. On a quantitative basis we could show that the activity localized to
both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of both cell types analyzed
independent of cell proliferation. The presence of significant levels of UMA in
the cytoplasm of human brain cells following growth arrestment in vitro with
retinoic acid supports the interpretation that UMA may contribute to the
attenuation of MV gene functions during the primary infection of brain cells,
thereby supporting the establishment of virus persistence.<p>

ABSTRACT:  By means of RT-PCR, a portion of measles virus (MV) mRNA encoding

obtained from administrative autopsy cases, who apparently had not suffered
from subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)-like central nervous system
disorders. Most of the brain-derived NP sequences showed significant
asynonymous nucleotide substitutions when compared with wild-type MV isolates
and SSPE virus. Our present results suggest that MV commonly persists in the
human brain without causing apparent clinical symptoms, probably due to
decreased virus replication.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A 20-year-old man who had developed involuntary movement of his left
hand and memorial disturbance visited our hospital in December, 1991. On
admission, myoclonus, dementia and speech disturbance were recognized. He was
diagnosed as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) based on a high titer
of serum anti-measles antibody (1/256), serum anti-measles-IgG antibody (&gt;
1/4,800) and typical EEG fiding of periodic synchronus discharge (PSD). Inosine
pranobex was administrated orally (4,800mg per day). Serial cranial magnetic
resonance imagings (MRI) were taken since January, 1992 to June, 1994. No
abnormal finding was demonstrated until April 16, 1992 in MRI, but 123I-IMP
SPECT detected decreased accumulation in parietal to occipital lobes on early
image in February 5, 1992. Marked high signal area on T2 weighted image in
right temporal lobe and parieto-occipital lobe were firstly demonstrated in
June 22, 1992 on MRI. These high signal lesions alternated the areas and
locations, but the changes were not related to his clinical symptom. These
findings may suggest ischemic changes after demyelination. His symptoms have
been improving gradually since June, 1994. To our knowledge, 42 cases of
adult-onset SSPE were reported so far (5 were in Japan). This case is the first
report in the world on adult-onset SSPE serially observed with MRI and SPECT
since early stage.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Measles virus (MV) RNA is present in endothelial cells (Ec) in brain
tissue from cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and relatively
high titres of infectious virus are produced in human cerebral Ec in vitro.
Infection of Ec at the blood-brain barrier could therefore provide the
opportunity for entry of virus to the CNS. Adhesion of syngeneic splenocytes to
MV infected murine (Balb/c) cerebral Ec is found to be upregulated. Increased
expression of endothelial adhesion molecules, following virus infection at the
blood-brain-barrier, may be an important mechanism in inducing inflammatory
infiltration of the CNS in SSPE.<p>

and further investigated in animal models and tissue culture. Several
mechanisms contributing to MV persistence are discussed. Recent findings,
especially the analysis of CD46 and moesin as receptor acting molecules for MV,
correlate well with the tropism of MV and open new fields for the investigation
of MV associated immunosuppression and central nervous system (CNS)
complications.<p>

mechanisms that affect both viral transcription and translation. Host enzymes
that hypermutate viral genes, and those induced by cytokines, may act

ABSTRACT:  Neurologic diseases are important complications of measles. The role
of virus infection of the central nervous system as well as the route of virus
entry has been unclear. Five autopsied cases of individuals who died with
severe acute measles 3-10 d after the onset of the rash were studied for
evidence of viral involvement of the central nervous system. In all cases, in
situ hybridization and RT-PCR in situ hybridization techniques showed
endothelial cell infection. Immunoperoxidase staining with an anti-ferritin
antibody revealed a reactive microgliosis. These data suggest that endothelial
cells in the brain are frequently infected during acute fatal measles. This
site of infection may provide a portal of entry for virus in individuals who
subsequently develop subacute sclerosing panencephalitis or measles inclusion
body encephalitis and a target for immunologic reactions in post-measles
encephalomyelitis.<p>

ABSTRACT:  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the characteristics of severe complications
of measles in patients admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit. DESIGN:
Clinical description of a case series. SETTING: The Pediatric Intensive Care
Unit of Soroka Medical Center, Beer-Sheva, Israel, during a measles epidemic.
PATIENTS: Fifteen pediatric patients with measles requiring intensive care.
RESULTS: Fifteen of 237 hospitalized children with measles required intensive
care in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. Eleven patients were malnourished;
none had been vaccinated for measles. All 15 patients required mechanical
ventilation for pneumonia that had caused severe respiratory distress. Twelve
of 15 patients were severely hypoxemic before intubation. Seven had a clinical
syndrome consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome. Other
complications on admission to the intensive care unit included spontaneous
pneumothorax in three patients, empyema in two, encephalopathy in seven, shock
in three, sepsis in five, hypocalcemia in 11, thrombocytopenia in eight, and
coagulopathy in seven. Complications during treatment included pneumothorax in
four patients, fibrosing alveolitis in one, brain infarct in one, thrombus
formation in three, and nosocomial sepsis in one. Four patients had long-term
sequelae (chronic lung disease, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis,
hemiplegia, and partial amputation of a limb), and seven patients recovered
uneventfully. Four patients died; all had adult respiratory distress syndrome,
three had pneumothorax, and one had nosocomial sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients
with measles who require intensive care have a high risk for death or long-term
complications, even when treated in a modern pediatric intensive care unit.
Adult respiratory distress syndrome and air leaks were the most severe
complications in these patients. To reduce the severity of these complications,
mechanical ventilation should be based on using the lowest possible inspiratory
pressure and fraction of inspired oxygen, while accepting an arterial oxygen
pressure less than 60 mm Hg. Secondary bacteremia was an early and prominent
complication, and antibiotic treatment should be instituted early in patients
with measles requiring intensive care.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A number of in situ hybridization protocols using digoxigenin or
biotin labelled probes were assessed for viral nucleic acid detection in
formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue. Single-step detection protocols for
biotin labelled probes produced low sensitivity; however, enzyme based one-step
detection protocols for digoxigenin probes produced high sensitivity for both
RNA and DNA systems. For both probe types, multistep detection protocols
produced equally high sensitivity. Use of an enhanced APAAP procedure for
digoxigenin labelled probes achieved maximal sensitivity without use of
biotin-strep-tavidin reactions. The sensitivity of nucleic acid detection
obtained with a digoxigenin labelled probe is comparable to that obtained using
biotin. Digoxigenin labelled probes for nucleic acid detection are recommended
for tissues with endogenous biotin.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Recent effective treatments for subacute sclerosing panencephalitis
(SSPE) are oral inosiplex and intrathecal interferon therapy. The former seems
to be effective for life expectancy but not for neurological disability, and
the latter is a debating antiviral treatment although favorable reports are
increasing. A 12 year-10 month-old boy with SSPE was presented as a successful
case of prolonged effectiveness in both neurological symptoms and life
expectancy. There are no significant side effects by the 200 weeks treatment of
intrathecal alpha-interferon of large dose (6 million unit/dose/week) and
ordinary dose of inosiplex (100 mg/kg/day). Neurological disability index
(Dyken) improved from 70% to 10%; speech and higher cerebral functions improved
from aphasia and almost vegetative states to verbal communicable level; motor
dysfunction from bedridden to wheel chair level; and myoclonic and other
seizures were controlled. Laboratory data also improved; periodic synchronized
discharge (PSD) and other paroxysmal discharges disappeared and alpha activity
that had once disappeared in the background activity of active stages
reappeared in the EEGs. Measles antibodies in serum and CSF improved, and
oligoclonal bands disappeared. However diffuse brain atrophy remained on
neuroimaging. Long-term intrathecal large dose treatment with alpha-interferon
is effective and safe. It should be started as soon as the diagnosis is made,
and a trial of large-dose and long-term therapy may be worthy even for more
advanced cases irrespective of progress of neuroimages.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Current postulates support the idea that MS is triggered by an
infectious agent or agents through an autoimmune reaction directed against
brain antigens in genetically susceptible individuals. Evidence for an
infectious etiology of MS is indirect. We have proposed that MS may, in some
instances, be due to a zoonotic infection and that canine distemper virus, a
measles-like virus in dogs, is a likely candidate in the causation of this
disorder. The high homology between canine distemper and measles virus proteins
has made it extremely difficult to distinguish distemper from measles
antibodies serologically. We now provide evidence that humans can be infected
with this neurotropic dog virus. Furthermore, a high titer of canine distemper
virus antibodies is significantly associated with MS. Identification of the
etiologic agent in MS may lead to the elucidation of disease pathogenesis and
to disease prevention through appropriate public health and vaccination
programs.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Synthetic peptides representing T- and B-cell epitopes from the
fusion (F) protein of measles virus (MV) were tested for their ability to
induce a protective immune response against intracerebral challenge with
neuroadapted strains of MV and canine distemper virus (CDV) in mice. Of the
panel of peptides tested, only a chimeric peptide consisting of two copies of a
promiscuous T-cell epitope (representing residues 288 to 302 of MV F protein)
synthesized at the amino terminus of a B-cell epitope (representing residues
404 to 414 of MV F protein) was able to induce a protective response against
challenge with MV and CDV in inbred mice. The protective response induced by
this peptide (TTB) was associated with a significant reduction in mortality,
histological absence of acute encephalitis, and greatly reduced titers of virus
in the brains of TTB-immune mice following challenge compared with the results
for nonimmunized controls. A chimeric peptide comprising one copy of the T-cell
epitope and one copy of the B-cell epitope (TB) did not induce a protective
response. A comparison of the antibody responses induced by the two chimeras
suggested that differences in protective efficacy following immunization may be
a result of the higher affinity of the antibody induced by the TTB peptide than
that of the antibody induced by the TB peptide. In addition, differences in the
immunoglobulin G subclass of the antipeptide antibody responses were observed,
and these may play a role in the differences in protection observed. These
results indicate that appropriately designed synthetic peptides have potential
as vaccines for the induction of cross-reactive protection against
morbilliviruses.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Representational difference analysis was used to search for
pathogens in multiple sclerosis brains. We detected a 341-nucleotide fragment
that was 99.4% identical to the major DNA binding protein gene of human
herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). Examination of 86 brain specimens by PCR demonstrated
that HHV-6 was present in &gt; 70% of MS cases and controls and is thus a
commensal virus of the human brain. By DNA sequencing, 36/37 viruses from MS
cases and controls were typed as HHV-6 variant B group 2. Other herpesviruses,
retroviruses, and measles virus were detected infrequently or not at all. HHV-6
expression was examined by immunocytochemistry with monoclonal antibodies
against HHV-6 virion protein 101K and DNA binding protein p41. Nuclear staining
of oligodendrocytes was observed in MS cases but not in controls, and in MS
cases it was observed around plaques more frequently than in uninvolved white
matter. MS cases showed prominent cytoplasmic staining of neurons in gray
matter adjacent to plaques, although neurons expressing HHV-6 were also found
in certain controls. Since destruction of oligodendrocytes is a hallmark of MS,
these studies suggest an association of HHV-6 with the etiology or pathogenesis
of MS.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Measles virus infection of the central nervous system in the murine
model of experimental measles virus-induced encephalitis is successfully
controlled by virus-specific T-helper lymphocytes. T cells from BALB/c mice
that are resistant to measles virus encephalitis proliferate well against
measles virus in vitro, and bulk cultures recognize viral nucleocapsid and
hemagglutinin as well as fusion proteins. The measles virus-specific T cells
secrete large amounts of interleukin 2 (IL-2), gamma interferon (IFN-gamma),
and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) but no IL-4, IL-6, or IL-10, and
hence the cytokine pattern is consistent with that of subtype 1 T-helper
lymphocytes. In contrast, cells obtained from measles virus-infected
susceptible C3H mice recognize measles virus proteins only weakly and secrete
little IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Treatment of infected mice with anti-TNF-alpha
antibodies has no effect on survival or virus clearance from the brain. Upon
neutralization of IFN-gamma in vivo, the phenotype of measles virus-specific
T-helper cells isolatable from BALB/c mice is reversed from subtype 1 to
subtype 2-like. Anti-IFN-gamma antibody-treated BALB/c mice are susceptible to
measles virus encephalitis, and viral clearance from the central nervous system
is impaired. These results indicate that IFN-gamma plays a significant role in
the control of measles virus infection of the central nervous system.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Guillain-Barre syndrome has been considered to be primarily an acute
inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP). Our experience with
Guillain-Barre syndrome in northern China differs from the traditional concept.
Electrophysiologically and pathologically, most of our patients have motor
axonal degeneration with minimal cellular inflammation, which we have termed
'acute motor axonal neuropathy' (AMAN). The current studies were undertaken to
characterize prospectively the clinical, electrophysiological, and serological
features of Guillain-Barre syndrome, defined clinically, in northern China. In
1991 and 1992, we characterized by electrodiagnostic criteria 129 Chinese
patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome. The AMAN form was present in 65% of
patients, the AIDP form in 24% and 11% were unclassifiable. For the 38 patients
who presented from January to October, 1992, we performed serological assays
for antibodies to Campylobacter jejuni and to glycolipids. Of these 38
patients, 55% had AMAN, 32% had AIDP and 13% were unclassifiable. Sixty-six
percent of the 38 had serological evidence of recent C. jejuni infection as
compared with 16% of village controls (P = 0.001). Seventy-six percent of AMAN
patients and 42% of AIDP patients were seropositive. IgG anti-GM1 antibodies
were more frequent in Guillain-Barre syndrome patients compared with village
controls (42% versus 6%; P &lt; 0.01). However, no statistically significant
correlations were found between the pattern of disease, AMAN or AIDP,
anti-glycolipid antibodies, or C. jejuni antibodies. Based on
electrophysiological criteria, Guillain-Barre syndrome in northern China can be
divided into two predominant forms: AIDP and AMAN. The AMAN form is more common
and predominates in the yearly summer outbreaks of Guillain-Barre
syndrome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<p>

ABSTRACT:  PURPOSE: To investigate the imaging and pathologic characteristics
of acute encephalopathy with bilateral thalamotegmental involvement in infants
and children. METHODS: Five Japanese children ranging in age from 11 to 29
months were studied. We performed CT imaging in all patients, 10 MR
examinations in four patients, and an autopsy in one patient. RESULTS: The
encephalopathy affected the thalami, brain stem tegmenta, and cerebral and
cerebellar white matter. The brain of the autopsied case showed fresh necrosis
and brain edema without inflammatory cell infiltration. Petechiae and
congestion were demonstrated mainly in the thalamus. CT and MR images showed
symmetric focal lesions in the same areas in the early phase. These lesions
became more demarcated and smaller in the intermediate phase. The ventricles
and cortical sulci enlarged. MR images demonstrated T1 shortening in the
thalami. The prognosis was generally poor; one patient died, three patients
were left with severe sequelae, and only one patient improved. CONCLUSIONS: The
encephalopathy might be a postviral or postinfectious brain disorder. T1
shortening in the thalami indicated the presence of petechiae.<p>

ABSTRACT:  MxA is a GTPase that accumulates to high levels in the cytoplasm of
interferon-treated human cells. Expression of MxA cDNA confers to transfected
cell lines a high degree of resistance against several RNA viruses, including
influenza, measles, vesicular stomatitis, and Thogoto viruses. We have now
generated transgenic mice that express MxA cDNA in the brain and other organs
under the control of a constitutive promoter. Embryonic fibroblasts derived
from the transgenic mice were nonpermissive for Thogoto virus and showed
reduced susceptibility for influenza A and vesicular stomatitis viruses. The
transgenic animals survived challenges with high doses of Thogoto virus by the
intracerebral or intraperitoneal route. Furthermore, the transgenic mice were
more resistant than their nontransgenic littermates to intracerebral infections
with influenza A and vesicular stomatitis viruses. These results demonstrate
that MxA is a powerful antiviral agent in vivo, indicating that it may protect
humans from the deleterious effects of infections with certain viral
pathogens.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Astrocyte cultures of adult human brain were used to study the
morphogenesis of measles virus at different multiplicity of infection.
High-dose (1 to 10 TCD50/ml) inoculation of the culture was found to give rise
to an acute infection with cytolysis on days 10-12 postinfection and formation
of extracellular mature virions. Low multiplicity of infection (0.01-0.1
TCD50/ml) caused the persistence of virus. During a persistent infection the
virus in titers 1.7 to 2.4 lg TCD50/ml was detected as long as up to the 3rd
passage. Ultrastructural studies of such cultures revealed some features which
were not observed in an acute infection: (1) the diameter of intracytoplasmic
RNP increased by 1.5 times vs. that in other cell cultures because of coarse
thickening of the envelope; (2) numerous immature virions in which
nucleocapsids were completely or partially absent; and (3) uncommonly low
number of mature virions. Moreover, alterations in the spatial orientation of
cytoskeleton components, such as intermediate and thin (actin) filaments were
observed. A conclusion is made that astrocytes as a reservoir for measles virus
accumulation serve as the source of immature envelope virus production, which
may be one of the possible causes of sclerosing panencephalitis. The causes of
disturbances in RNP transport from the site of assembly to cell membrane are
discussed.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Expression of endothelial cell (EC) adhesion molecules is increased
in inflammatory neurological disorders and this may regulate lymphocyte homing
to the central nervous system (CNS). Viral encephalitis is characterised by
lymphocytic infiltration of the CNS and one mechanism of this response may be
EC adhesion molecule induction with consequent inflammatory cell/EC binding.
This report characterises the effects of herpes simplex 1 (HSV1) or measles
virus (MV) infection of BALB/c brain microvascular EC in vitro on adhesion of
naive syngenic splenocytes and levels of ICAM-1. Adhesion was enhanced by 42%
for MV-infected cells and by 73% for HSV-1-infected EC. At the multiplicities
of infection employed, levels of ICAM-1 were upregulated on HSV-1-infected EC,
but not on MV-infected EC. It is concluded that ICAM-1/ligand interactions do
not play a role in mediation of MV enhancement of adherence, but represent one
mechanism responsible for increased lymphocyte adherence to HSV-1-infected
cerebral EC.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The nucleotide sequences of the large protein (L) gene derived from
two wild-type measles viruses (MV) and two SSPE brain-derived viruses have been
determined. All sequences have single large open reading frames encoding 2183
amino acid residues. The deduced L proteins are well conserved and the proposed
functional domains which have been identified for rhabdo- and paramyxoviruses
are completely conserved in all strains. The degree of variability of L
proteins is the lowest of all structural proteins of MV, reflecting its role in
virus reproduction and persistence. Biased hypermutation was not observed in
the L genes derived from SSPE brain tissue. None of the nucleotide changes can
be associated with the attenuated phenotype of the Edmonston vaccine viruses.<p>

and onset of blindness. He soon became comatose and died 6 weeks later. Brain
biopsy showed nuclear inclusion bodies resembling viral capsids, astrocytosis
and perivascular lymphocytic cuffing but no demyelination. The diagnosis of
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis was made on finding: measles virus antigens
in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid, the identification of measles RNA
sequences in brain tissue by the polymerase chain reaction, and intense,
oligoclonal, IgG-banding in the CSF. However, the relatively advanced age of
the patient, the absence of myoclonus and the nondistinctive EEG profile
lacking synchronous bursts of high-voltage slow and sharp waves, are unusual.<p>

sections, and 10 nm gold conjugated secondary antibody and electron microscopy
on ultrathin sections. The techniques were validated using both measles
infected vero cells and human tissues with established measles infection: these
included brain affected by subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and acute
measles appendicitis. The technique was applied subsequently to six untreated
cases of granulomatous Crohn's disease, and two cases of ileocaecal
tuberculosis, a granulomatous control. Mumps primary antibody--applied to both
mumps infected vero cells, and measles infected vero cells and tissues studied
by immunoperoxidase, and measles antibody on mumps infected cells studied by
immunoperoxidase and immunogold--were used as specificity controls: the primary
antibodies identified their respective target antigen and there was no antibody
cross reactivity. Measles virus nucleocapsids labelled with gold conjugated
antibody in both infected cells and tissues, including foci of granulomatous
inflammation in five of six cases of Crohn's disease: in the fifth case, the
granuloma could not be identified in ultrathin section. In one of the
tuberculosis cases, a low level of signal was noted while the second case was
negative. Labelling adopted a characteristic pattern in all infected tissues,
strengthening the specificity of these findings. This study provides the first
direct confirmation of persistent measles virus infection of the intestine.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Sequence analysis of the nucleoprotein and phosphoprotein (P) genes
of viruses in the hamster neurotropic lineage of measles virus revealed that
the neurotropic variants are quite different from the Philadelphia 26
progenitor strain. In Vero cells persistently infected with the hamster
neurotropic strain, predicted changes occur in 5.0% of the nucleoprotein and
8.1% of the P amino acids and some of these changes appear to affect the
relative electrophoretic mobility of each protein. To evaluate one aspect of
the viral polymerase complex containing these mutations, the distribution of P
mRNA editing in each of the three strains was determined by both cloning and
sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragments which included
the editing site and by primer extension analysis of viral mRNA. Editing of P
mRNA in the neurotropic strains shows a shift away from the single G insertion
product to those with greater than 2 Gs inserted. The altered editing
distribution has implications for the role of transcriptional regulation in
measles virus persistence.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In order to examine the status of quinolinic acid (QUIN) metabolism
in a model of delayed excitotoxic neurodegeneration, the de novo production of
QUIN from 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid was assessed in brain homogenates and brain
slices of mice injected with hamster neurotropic measles virus. In the
hippocampus, which presents exclusive nerve cell loss in this model, the
activity of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase, an astrocytic enzyme
responsible for the biosynthesis of QUIN, was increased 3.3-fold by 7 days
after virus inoculation. Less dramatic increases were observed in the cerebral
cortex and the striatum, while cerebellar enzyme activity was not different
from control values. In the same brain homogenates, no changes occurred in the
activities of kynurenine aminotransferase, the biosynthetic enzyme of the
neuroprotectant kynurenic acid, and of the astrocytic marker glutamine
synthetase. At 7 days postinoculation, hippocampal slices from virus-treated
animals, when exposed to 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, produced 18 times more QUIN
than slices from control animals. Notably, a significant increase was also seen
3 days postinoculation, i.e., at a time when astrocytes had started to
proliferate but prior to the onset of neurodegeneration (Eur. J. Neurosci.
3:66-71, 1991). These data suggest that astrocyte-derived QUIN may play a
causative role in the occurrence of hippocampal nerve cell loss in measles
virus-infected mice.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is related to "defective"
measles virus or vaccination, though an association with parainfluenza viruses
has been reported. SSPE is characterized by a slow, erratic course and elevated
cerebrospinal fluid measles titers. An immunocompetent, vaccinated infant, with
onset of symptoms in parainfluenza virus season and a catastrophic course is
described. Cerebrospinal fluid titers were negative, but postmortem brain had
typical SSPE lesions. Patient brain-derived RNA, subjected to reverse
transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction yielded polymerase chain
reaction products with measles virus but not parainfluenza virus genes. The
sequenced fragment revealed multiple mutations, typical for SSPE. SSPE can thus
present in infants, with short latency and no cerebrospinal fluid antibodies.
Viral genomic analysis may be diagnostic, permitting early therapy.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The biological activity of monoclonal antibodies specific for the
hemagglutinin protein of measles virus strain CAM recognizing six epitope
groups according to their binding properties to measles virus strain CAM/R401
was investigated in vivo in our rat model of measles encephalitis. When
injected intraperitoneally into measles virus-infected suckling rats, some
monoclonal antibodies modified the disease process and prevented the
necrotizing encephalopathy seen in untreated animals. The analysis of measles
virus brain isolates revealed emergence of variants that resisted
neutralization with the passively transferred selecting monoclonal antibody but
not with other monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibody escape mutants were
also isolated in vitro, and their neurovirulence varied in the animal model.
Sequence data from the hemagglutinin gene of measles virus localize a major
antigenic surface determinant of the hemagglutinin protein between amino acid
residues 368 and 396, which may be functionally important for neurovirulence.
The data indicate that the interaction of antibodies with the measles virus H
protein plays an important role in the selection of neurovirulent variants.
These variants have biological properties different from those of the parent
CAM virus.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Twelve children with type 1 herpes simplex encephalitis (3 with
relapse, 9 without) have been monitored during the past 7 years. Ten of the
children received intravenous infusion of acyclovir (30 mg/kg/day) for 10 days,
1 child who experienced relapse received 15 mg/kg/day, and another relapsed
child received no antiviral agents until relapse. Relapse occurred 20-36 days
after initial onset. All relapsed patients underwent another 10 days of
acyclovir treatment (30 mg/kg/day). Choreoathetosis appeared as the initial
sign of relapse followed by rapidly progressive unresponsiveness in all 3
relapsed patients: in 1 nonrelapsed patient choreoathetosis occurred during the
recovery period. In these 4 patients involuntary movement was remitted within 3
months to 2 years. One patient with choreoathetosis died of measles pneumonia 4
months after onset of herpes simplex encephalitis and the surviving 3 were
severely retarded. Although neuroimaging sparing of basal ganglia does not
indicate structural and functional abnormalities, the disturbance of the neural
connection among the basal ganglia and the cerebral cortex, which manifested
severe damage over frontal, temporal, and parietal mantles on CT, may be the
source of movement disorders in these patients. We conclude that
choreoathetosis may be the first sign of relapse of herpes simplex encephalitis
in children and may be an indicator of poor prognosis. The neuropathogenesis of
choreoathetosis requires further investigation.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Clinical observations and experimental animal models have stressed
the importance of the cellular immune response in the recovery from measles
virus infection. However, the relative contribution of different T-cell subsets
to viral elimination is controversial. The aim of the present study was to
define the components of the immune system which contribute to the control of
measles virus infection. For this purpose the effect of in vivo depletion of
CD4+ and/or CD8+ T lymphocytes in the murine model of experimental acute
measles encephalitis was monitored with respect to disease manifestation,
survival, neuropathological changes, virus elimination from brain, and
antiviral antibody titre. In measles virus-resistant BALB/c mice removal of the
CD8+ T-cell subset did not interfere with the clearance of virus from the
brain. In contrast, depletion of CD4+ T cells rendered BALB/c mice susceptible
to infection. Also, in measles virus-susceptible C3H mice CD4+ T cells played a
role in recovery from measles infection, but seemed not to be as effective as
CD4+ T cells from resistant BALB/c mice. The data indicate that CD4+ T cells
are essential for protection against measles virus-infection of the central
nervous system.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We report a 21-year-old man with agammaglobulinemia and chronic
progressive encephalopathy. The patient was diagnosed as having X-linked
agammaglobulinemia at 6 months of age, and gamma globulin supplementation was
initiated. He exhibited normal development until he was 11 years old, when he
showed a decline in school performance and a personality change. Computed
tomography images at that time disclosed diffuse cerebral atrophy. Several
generalized tonic-clonic convulsions, myoclonus and spasticity appeared at the
age of 13 years. He lost his ability to walk and speak at the age of 17 years
old. He is currently 21 years old and displays severe mental deterioration and
spastic tetraplegia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed progressive diffuse
cerebral atrophy with no change in intensity. The cerebellum and the brain stem
were relatively well maintained. Viral isolations were negative and serum
antibody titers for rubella, measles, and human immune deficiency virus were
not elevated. Our patient's symptoms resemble those previously reported as
chronic progressive encephalopathy without viral isolation. This condition may
be a complication of agammaglobulinemia. It is possible that the encephalopathy
of our patient has the same etiology as that described in the other reports.
Further attempts to identify the etiology of the encephalopathy using molecular
techniques are necessary.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Measles virus (MV)-specific transcription in human brain cells is
characterized by particularly low abundances of the distal mRNAs encoding the
MV envelope proteins. Similar transcriptional restrictions of the closely
related vesicular stomatitis virus have been observed in mouse fibroblasts
constitutively expressing the interferon-inducible MxA protein (P. Staeheli and
J. Pavlovic, J. Virol. 65:4498-4501, 1991). We found that MV infection of human
brain cells is accompanied by rapid induction and high-level expression of
endogenous MxA proteins. After stable transfection of MxA, human glioblastoma
cells (U-87-MxA) released 50- to 100-fold less infectious virus and expression
of viral proteins was highly restricted. The overall MV-specific transcription
levels were reduced by up to 90%, accompanied by low relative frequencies of
the distal MV-specific mRNAs. These restrictions were linked to an inhibition
of viral RNA synthesis and not to a decreased stability of the viral RNAs. Our
results indicate that expression of MxA is associated with transcriptional
attenuation of MV in brain cells, thus probably contributing to the
establishment of persistent MV central nervous system infections. In addition,
the mechanism of MxA-dependent resistance against MV infection, in contrast to
that of vesicular stomatitis virus, is cell type specific, because an
inhibition of MV glycoprotein synthesis independent of transcriptional
alterations was observed in MxA-transfected human monocytes (J. J. Schnorr, S.
Schneider-Schaulies, A. Simon-Jodicke, J. Pavlovic, M. A. Horisberger, and V.

ABSTRACT:  A 23-year-old woman in her 23rd week of gestation became febrile and
then developed cutaneous eruption typical of measles on July 16, 1993. Two
weeks prior to this, her 8-month-old daughter has developed measles. The woman
became comatose in a few days and was admitted to our hospital where coma,
flaccid paralysis of all four limbs and midbrain corectopia were apparent. High
titers of anti-measles antibodies were found in the serum and cerebrospinal
fluid. She received a 3-day course of pulse-dose intravenous
methylprednisolone, however, without effect. Her consciousness gradually
improved and after 1 month, subtle volitional movements were observed. However,
fetal death was found and the fetus was removed by cesarean section. In MRI
T2-weighted images, earlier in her illness, high signal intensity areas were
scattered deeply in the cerebral white matter and the posterior limbs of the
internal capsule. However, T1-weighted image was unremarkable. Marked, diffuse
cerebral atrophy was noticed 3 months later by both CT and MRI, which was
accompanied by wide spread high signal intensity areas around the lateral and
fourth ventricles. Regarding the pathogenesis, there are two possibilities,
i.e., her encephalitis was due to direct measles viral invasion into the CNS,
or due to the autoimmune processes triggered by measles infection. Immune
dysfunction known to occur during pregnancy might be responsible for the
severity of encephalitis the patient suffered from. A recent increase in the
number of adult measles infection might be an admonition that pregnant women
are not exceptional to measles infection and that the infection could give rise
to a severe form of measles encephalitis.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Evidence is presented showing that the brain cells of patients with
subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) contain mutant measles (MV) genomes
having the characteristics of 5' copy-back defective interfering (DI) RNAs.
Using a polymerase chain reaction-based amplification specific for copy-back
DIs, abundant, discrete cDNAs representing different-sized MV defective RNA
species were generated from each SSPE brain. The defective genomes were cloned
in two portions. The most common of these defective species were sequenced,
confirming their MV genome origin and 5' copy-back nature. We deduced that the
minimum DI stem length of these species was 95 nucleotides, further delimiting
the prerequisite 5' regulatory region sequences specifying MV genomic
replication/encapsidation functions. This calculation assumes a precise
copy-back mechanism and complete complementarity of the panhandle structure.
Since the SSPE-derived viral genome encodes dysfunctional viral envelope
proteins, we hypothesize that SSPE brains may lack the high degree of selective
pressure encountered in tissue culture MV infections. This allows for the
coexistence of numerous replication-competent defective particles in each SSPE
brain. A role for viral defective particles as modulators of this persistent
measles virus infection of humans is proposed.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Encephalitis is the result of focal or global inflammation of the
brain caused by invasion of the brain parenchyma by viruses, bacteria,
parasites or fungi. In addition, postinfectious encephalitis may result from
immunological processes as a consequence of preceding viral infections such as
measles. For most forms of viral encephalitis no specific therapy is available.
Herpes simplex encephalitis may be diagnosed using modern laboratory techniques
for detection of viral DNA without the need for brain biopsy. Herpes simplex
encephalitis responds well to treatment with acyclovir, as does encephalitis
caused by varicella-zoster virus, which typically occurs following cutaneous
herpes zoster involving dermatomal distributions of the trigeminal nerve. In
immunocompromised hosts many etiologies of encephalitis need to be considered.
It is important to arrive at a precise diagnosis in order to choose appropriate
therapeutic agents directed toward treatable pathogens such as Toxoplasma
gondii and cytomegalovirus.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) cores extracted from virions of wild-type
(Edmonston strain) measles virus (MV) or obtained from MV-infected cells (cRNP)
were shown to be capable of transcribing RNA in vitro but at relatively low
efficiency. The tightly bound matrix (M) protein could be effectively removed
from virion RNP (vRNP) and from cRNP by exposure to buffers of high ionic
strength (0.5 to 1.0 M KCl) but only at pH 8.0 or higher. The vRNP and cRNP
cores complexed with M protein exhibited markedly reduced transcriptional
activity at increasing concentrations, whereas vRNP and cRNP cores free of M
protein exhibited linear and substantially higher transcriptional activity;
these data suggest that M protein is the endogenous inhibitor of MV RNP
transcription. M-gene cDNA clones derived from three strains of wild-type (wt)
MV and 10 clones from mRNAs isolated from the brain tissue of patients who had
died from subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and from measles inclusion
body encephalitis (MIBE) were recloned in the pTM-1 expression vector driven by
the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase expressed by a coinfecting vaccinia virus
recombinant. All 10 mutant SSPE and MIBE clones expressed in vitro and in vivo
M proteins that reacted with monospecific anti-M polyclonal antibody and
migrated on polyacrylamide gels to positions identical to or only slightly
different from those of the M proteins expressed by wt MV clones. When
reconstituted with cRNP cores, the three expressed wt M proteins and 6 of the
10 mutant-expressed M proteins showed equivalent capacity to down-regulate MV
transcription. Three of the M proteins from SSPE clones and one from the MIBE
clone showed little or no capacity to down-regulate transcription when
reconstituted with cRNP cores. The only plausible explanations for loss of
transcription inhibition activity by the four SSPE/MIBE M proteins were
exceedingly high degrees of hypermutations leading to U--&gt;C transitions and
cloning-corrected mutations in the initiator codon (ATG--&gt;ACG) of the four M
genes. However, only the hypermutated M protein expressed by the MIBE cDNA
clone exhibited virtually no capacity to bind cRNP cores in a reconstitution
assay. These experiments provide some preliminary data to support the
hypothesis that MV encephalitis may result from certain selective mutations in
the M gene.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The expression of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6 and tumor necrosis
factor (TNF) alpha transcripts in cultured human glial cells was examined using
reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification
and Southern blot quantitation. Microglial cultures derived from brain biopsy
specimens from three different individuals expressed transcripts for the three
cytokines under basal culture conditions. This expression was enhanced in
response to measles virus (MV) infection (IL-1 beta, 2.2-8.8-fold; IL-6,
2.5-8.4-fold; TNF alpha, 2.2-3.2-fold). Neither IL-1 beta nor TNF alpha
transcripts were detectable in undissociated brain tissue from two individuals,
suggesting that the basal expression of these cytokines in culture may have
been induced by tissue dissociation or by the culture conditions.
Oligodendrocytes did not express cytokine transcripts under basal culture
conditions, and IL-1 beta and IL-6 but not TNF alpha transcripts could be
induced by MV. Similarly, meningeal fibroblasts expressed IL-1 beta and IL-6
but not TNF alpha in response to MV-infection, suggesting that the production
of TNF alpha is more cell type-restricted than either IL-1 beta or IL-6. The
results indicate that adult human microglia can participate in the inflammatory
response to MV infection in the CNS by producing cytokines that contribute to
inflammation and demyelination. In addition, besides their role in myelination,
oligodendrocytes can potentially influence immunoreactivity in the CNS by
producing IL-1 beta and IL-6.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Two young patients with subacute measles encephalitis are described:
a 20-year-old male hemophiliac infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
and a 4-year-old girl with acute leukemia. Both patients were afebrile and had
persistent focal seizures and slurred speech beginning 2 and 7 months,
respectively, after the onset of uncomplicated acute measles. The diagnosis of
subacute measles encephalitis was established by demonstration of paramyxovirus
nucleocapsid on electron microscopy of brain tissue in one case and by
detection of measles virus genome with the polymerase chain reaction in both.
Treatment of the HIV-infected man with intravenous ribavirin was begun when the
patient lost consciousness after several weeks of seizures; he died. The girl
with leukemia was treated early after the onset of symptoms and recovered after
a 15-week course. Review of 31 previously published cases revealed a typical
clinical presentation. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis,
electroencephalography, measurement of measles antibody in serum and CSF, and
computed tomography of the brain were not helpful in the diagnosis of subacute
measles encephalitis. In contrast, histologic examination of brain tissue
proved useful in establishing the diagnosis. On the basis of our experience and
our literature review, we conclude that histologic and polymerase chain
reaction studies of brain tissue are required for the early diagnosis of
subacute measles encephalitis and that therapy with intravenous ribavirin is
effective when administered early.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) patients carry persistent
measles virus infection in the brain. Furthermore, the blood lymphocytes
contain viral RNA. Lymphocytes derived from 6 SSPE patients were stimulated
with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Production of antibodies against measles virus
of the IgG isotype was detected in the supernatants of cell cultures of all
patients, regardless of the disease's activity, duration or interferon therapy.
In contrast, only some of these cell cultures also produced antibodies against
myelin.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The questions how a viral infection induces cellular autoimmune
reactions (CMAI) and which components of both virus and auto-antigen play part
in this process were addressed in our animal model of measles virus
(MV)-induced CMAI against myelin basic protein (MBP) during subacute measles
encephalitis (SAME). In an attempt to define whether cellular or humoral immune
responses are involved in the occurrence of the autoimmune based disease
process, Lewis rats were treated with different combinations of antibodies and
T cells reactive with either MV and its structural proteins or MBP and
MBP-peptides. The only treatment combination after which experimental allergic
encephalomyelitis (EAE)-like disease and pathology developed was when
non-encephalitogenic T cells reactive against residues 69-81 of MBP were
adoptively transferred into MV-infected Lewis rats. The results of the study
show that T cells which are non-encephalitogenic in the normal central nervous
tissue are capable of inducing an allergic encephalomyelitis in animals with a
viral infection involving the brain.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The measles virus (MV) hemagglutinin (H) gene nucleotide sequences
of the LEC-WI strain and 11 branched sequential neutralization escape variants
of the strain derived by selection with five monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) were
determined by direct analysis of amplified polymerase chain reaction products.
The parental LEC-WI strain isolated from a patient with subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis exhibited H gene sequence characteristics similar to other
persistent virus strains derived from brain materials. Mostly single-point H
gene mutations, coding for single amino acid substitutions in the H protein,
were found to provide explanations for the resistance to the individual Mabs.
Resistance to Mabs 16-CD11 and I-41 resulted from changes of Gly-491 to Asp (or
Val) and Phe-552 to Val, respectively. One variant (B89) selected by Mab
16-CD11 had a mutation introduced by a single nucleotide deletion and
subsequent nucleotide insertion, which caused a shift in the open reading
frame. The epitope of Mab I-29 was assigned to Ser-313 or Gly-314, which were
changed to Leu and Arg, respectively. The variants subjected to the Mab I-44
selection exhibited change of Ser-189 to Pro. Radioimmunoprecipitation assay
and endoglycosidase H (Endo H) treatment revealed that this change destroyed a
potential N-linked glycosylation site, indicating that the carbohydrate chain
participates in formation of the epitope or indirectly influences its
properties. Resistance to Mab 16-DE6 involved three specific amino acid changes
in three different places, Gly-211 to Ser, Gly-388 to Asp, and Ser-532 to Phe
or Arg-533 to Gly, reflecting the occurrence of a conformational epitope. In
conclusion, this study identifies the precise positions of several critical
sites on the MV H protein which react with neutralizing antibodies.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Epidemiological studies performed to identify the possible cause of
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) suggest that an environmental agent could be involved
in its etiopathogenesis. For a long time it has been hypothesized that this
agent was a virus, but until now no virus specific to MS has been consistently
identified. Animal models indicate that the demyelination of the central
nervous system can be induced by certain families of viruses, but the
implication of this in the etiopathogenesis of MS has not been clearly
demonstrated. Morbilliviruses were the most studied. Research on this subject
arose from the observation of the similarity between the brain lesions
occurring in MS and encephalitis caused by the measles virus (Subacute
Sclerosing Panencephalitis). Antimeasles, antirubella, antiherpes zoster
antibodies have been found in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid of MS
patients, but the relationship between this finding and the disease is not
clear. It has recently been proposed that the pathogenetic immune response in
the brain of MS patients might be directed predominantly towards antigens of a
DNA virus, such as JCV. This preferentially infects glial cells and causes a
demyelinating syndrome in immunodeficient subjects, called Progressive
Multifocal Leucoencephalopathy. The target JC viral antigens in MS could be
synthesized during transient viral reactivation. A recent hypothesis is that
retroviruses may intervene in the etiopathogenesis of MS. Strong interest has
been taken in HTLV-I after its identification in Tropical Spastic Paraparesis,
a disease with certain similarities to MS. Serologic and polymerase chain
reaction findings from various authors have suggested an association between
this human retrovirus and MS. However more recent data are not consistent with
this. Current experiments aimed at detecting retroviral particles in long-term
cultured peripheral blood monocytes and cerebrospinal fluid mononuclear cells
in MS could clarify whether these cells provide a reservoir for such viruses,
with a latency of many years without expression at brain level.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The diagnostic approach of focal central nervous system lesions in
AIDS patients is now well established. In contrast, it is extremely difficult
to determine the cause of diffuse encephalopathies, occurring frequently at the
terminal stage of AIDS. Imaging is usually non specific and laboratory
investigations are seldom contributive. In most cases, the aetiological
diagnosis is provided by post mortem examination. In this first part of the
study the authors deal with viral encephalitides which represent a classical
and frequent cause of diffuse encephalopathy in AIDS. HIV encephalitis usually
causes a progressive brain disease resulting in severe dementia; imaging may
show diffuse leucoencephalopathy and/or cortico-subcortical atrophy. CMV
encephalitis is often asymptomatic, discovered at autopsy; however, this
diagnosis should be considered in patients with an encephalopathy of rapid
onset, discrete signs of meningitis, symptoms of myelo-radiculitis, or a
systemic CMV infection. Varicella-zoster virus encephalitis is not uncommon and
may occur in the absence of characteristic rash. Infections by herpes simplex
and measles viruses are exceptional.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Nucleotide sequence analysis was carried out to study genes encoding
the matrix (M) protein of measles virus (MV) from several regions of the brain
of a case of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. This analysis revealed the
presence of MV with "wild-type" sequences as well as variants which had
undergone at least five biased hypermutation events (U to C and A to G in the
positive strand sequences). Despite the presence of MV variants with genes
encoding the intact matrix protein open reading frame, M protein could not be
detected in any of the brain regions. The distribution of virus variants was
studied by cDNA cloning and sequence analysis and by in situ hybridization. The
hypermutated viruses appeared to expand clonally throughout the brain of
patient B.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Recovery from viral infection is a result of very complex
interactions between specific and nonspecific immune reactions and the
infectious agent. A variety of immune mechanisms are undoubtedly important
factors in this event and operate together in overcoming the infectious
process. However, despite much available information about these viral defense
mechanisms, it has proved remarkably difficult to assign a determinative role
in vivo to any single antiviral immunological mechanism in recovery from a
single viral disease, particularly since the immune response to the virus
itself may frequently contribute to the pathology of the disease. Furthermore,
if virus-induced immune responses are also directed against normal host
components, this may set the stage for an autoimmune disease. In this context
acute measles encephalomyelitis is of interest since in this disease autoimmune
reactions against brain antigens have been observed and considered of
pathogenetic importance. In this short review, virological and immunological
findings of measles virus infections in a rat model in relation to autoimmune
reactions will be presented and the mechanisms by which measles virus may alter
host reactivity against self-antigens discussed.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The expression of measles virus (MV) in six different permanent
human glioma cell lines (D-54, U-251, U-138, U-105, U-373, and D-32) was
analyzed. Although all cell lines were permissive for productive replication of
all MV strains tested, U-251, D-54, and D-32 cells spontaneously revealed
restrictions of MV transcription similar to those observed for primary rat
astroglial cells and brain tissue. In vitro differentiation of D-54 and U-251
cells by substances affecting the intracellular cyclic AMP level caused a
significant reduction of the expression of the viral proteins after 18, 72, and
144 h of infection. This pronounced restriction was not paralleled to a
comparable level by an inhibition of the synthesis and biological activity in
vitro of virus-specific mRNAs as shown by quantitative Northern (RNA) blot
analyses and in vitro translation. The block in viral protein synthesis could
not be attributed to the induction of type I interferon by any of the
substances tested. Our findings indicate that down-regulation of MV gene
expression in human brain cells can occur by a cell type-dependent regulation
of the viral mRNA transcription and a differentiation-dependent regulation of
translation, both of which may be crucial for the establishment of persistent
MV infections in the central nervous system.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The hamster neurotropic (HNT) strain of measles virus causes
non-inflammatory encephalopathy in Balb/c mice, associated with
neurodegeneration in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions. This loss of pyramidal
cells can be prevented by twice daily systemic treatment with 1 mg/kg
dizocilpine (5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclo-hepten-5,10-imine
maleate; MK-801) for 7 days. By varying the MK-801 treatment protocol, we now
found that drug administration during the last 4 days prior to sacrifice (i.e.
days 4-7 post inoculation, p.i.) is essential for neuroprotection. In contrast,
MK-801 treatment during the first days (days 0-4 p.i.) did not prevent the
neuronal necrosis. These data suggest that the concentration of an excitotoxic
factor in the mouse brain increases after virus inoculation, reaching toxic
levels by days 4-5 p.i. This novel 'subacute' mouse model of neurodegeneration
therefore constitutes an attractive tool for mechanistic and interventional
studies in excitotoxicity research.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Paramyxoviruses such as measles virus or canine distemper virus are
etiological agents for acute and chronic encephalitis (measles inclusion body
encephalitis, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and chronic distemper
encephalitis or old dog encephalitis). The mechanisms by which viral injury
leads to neurological diseases have not yet been fully elucidated. We have
developed an experimental model in mice in order to analyze the spatial and
temporal distribution of canine distemper virus in the central nervous system.
Cerebral target structures for viral replication were examined for the presence
of viral material (proteins and mRNA) during the two stages of the biphasic
disease. During the acute stage of infection all target areas could be
identified by day 6 with a similar anatomical distribution in all the animals
examined, which were either intracranially or intracerebroventricularly
infected. Viral mRNA and proteins were selectively localized in certain brain
structures such as the thalamus, hypothalamus, substantia nigra (pars
compacta), locus ceruleus and raphe nuclei (dorsalis and centralis), and limbic
system (hippocampus, septum, entorhinal and cingulate cortex, amygdala). The
virus was apparently unable to replicate in cerebellum, striatum, a large part
of cortex, or endothelial cells. During the subacute disease, viral material
was no longer detectable except in a few structures such as hypothalamus up to
4-6 weeks after inoculation. After this time, all target structures were devoid
of any labeling in spite of the occurrence of pathology (obesity, paralysis)
during this viral quiescent phase. These results suggest that after the initial
viral exposure, expression of viral genes in defined structures might disrupt
central homeostasis and finally may lead to neurological or neuroendocrine
diseases, even in the absence of the hallmarks of the virus.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Between 1971 and 1989 measles encephalitis was identified in five
children receiving chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Review of
these and previously reported cases of measles encephalitis in immunosuppressed
patients failed to identify any pathognomonic features in the history, the
clinical presentation, or the results of electroencephalography or computed
tomography. Detection of measles virus antigen in nasopharyngeal secretions or
intrathecal synthesis of specific antibody was not possible in all instances.
Early diagnosis by direct detection of viral antigen in the brain was
confounded by difficulties in identifying areas of the brain suitable for
biopsy. Increasing herd immunity to measles in the general population by
vaccination is the only effective intervention against measles encephalitis in
immunosuppressed children. Measles encephalitis must be remembered as a
possible explanation of encephalopathy in the immunocompromised child: the
benefits of early use of antiviral agents need to be evaluated.<p>

ABSTRACT:  As part of continuing multidisciplinary studies on the
neuropathogenesis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), in situ
hybridisation, immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy were used to detect
measles virus nucleic acid, protein and nucleocapsids in brain perivascular
infiltrates of three cases. Perivascular cuffing cells which contained measles
virus nucleic acid and antigens were found in all cases. Infected cuffs
occurred predominantly in areas of general parenchymal cell infection and in
many of these a high proportion of the infiltrating cells were infected. Other
cuffs in these areas were either uninfected or contained only a few infected
cells. Occasional infected cells were also seen in cuffs in non-infected areas.
In contrast, no specific immunocytochemical reactions or in situ hybridisation
for measles virus was observed in brain tissue from a patient with herpes
encephalitis. By electron microscopy viral nucleocapsid, consistent with
measles virus, was found within the cytoplasm of plasma cells in the
inflammatory cuffs in SSPE brain tissue. Possible explanations for our results
are that infiltrates become infected on arrival in the CNS or alternatively,
that the infected infiltrates reflect a generalised infection of the
reticuloendothelial system. The frequent presence of uninfected cuffs favours
the former explanation.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Measles virus (MV) rarely induces lethal diseases of the human
central nervous system characterized by reduced expression of the viral
envelope proteins and by lack of viral budding. The MV envelope contains two
integral membrane proteins, termed fusion (F) protein and hemagglutinin (H)
protein, and a membrane-associated matrix (M) protein. Previously, analysis of
MV genes from autopsy material indicated that the M protein and the F protein
intracellular domain are often drastically altered by mutations. Here, we
present evidence that truncation of the F protein intracellular domain does not
impair fusion function, and we suggest that this alteration interferes with
viral budding. Unexpectedly, certain combinations of functional F and H
proteins were unable to induce syncytium formation, an observation suggesting
that specific F-H protein interactions are required for cell fusion. We also
found that three of four H proteins of persistent MVs are defective in
intracellular transport, oligosaccharide modification, dimerization, and fusion
helper function. Thus, MVs replicating in the brain at the terminal stage of
infection are typically defective in M protein and in the two integral membrane
proteins. Whereas the M protein appears dispensable altogether, partial
preservation of F-protein function and H-protein function seems to be required,
presumably to allow local cell fusion. Certain subtle alterations of the F and
H proteins may be instrumental for disease development.<p>
