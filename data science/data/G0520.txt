Upcoming Eclipses of the Sun and Moon</a> in <b>Data Services</b>.)
</p>

<br>
<a name="top">
<br>
<p>While there is vast literature on all aspects of eclipses of all kinds,
most of it is contemporary, ephemeral, and often of limited circulation.
One must have access to a major library, a persistent interest, and
patience to investigate beyond a superficial survey.  The use of an
inter-library loan from a large university library may prove helpful.
This reference list is intended to be representative of the eclipse
literature; it is not intended to be complete.
</P>

<h4 align=center>Numerical Data from the U.S. Naval Observatory</h4>

<P>
The Astronomical Applications Department of the U. S. Naval Observatory
and Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office of the Royal Greenwich
Observatory jointly issue two annual publications which contain
numerical data for the eclipses of a given year.  The primary
publication is <em>The Astronomical Almanac</em>, usually issued during
the year preceding the year of the volume.  <em>Astronomical
Phenomena</em> is an inexpensive booklet containing a preprint of
selected phenomena data from the <em>Astronomical Almanac</em>.
<em>Astronomical Phenomena</em> is typically available several years
before the year of the booklet.  For further information, see
<a href="publications/docs/almanacs.html">
Annual Astronomical and Navigational Almanacs</a> in
<b>Publications</b>.

<p>
U. S. Naval Observatory Circular 170, <em>Solar Eclipses</em>,
1991-2000, gives the principal circumstances of all solar eclipses
occurring during the period, and includes an overall path map for each
eclipse.  It is useful for long-term planning purposes.  For ordering
information, see <a href="publications/docs/usnopubs.html">
U.S. Naval Observatory Special Publications</a> in
<b>Publications</b>.

<p>
The data in all of the above publications is predictive, showing where
and when eclipses will occur and be observable.
</p>

<h4 align=center>Eclipse Bulletins</h4>

<P>
The U. S. Naval Observatory's series of detailed eclipse Circulars was
discontinued in 1991, following an internal review.  However, in early
1993, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) initiated
a series of special eclipse bulletins providing detailed predictions,
including path maps and local circumstances, for individual eclipses.
The NASA bulletins are often in limited supply; information on
ordering them is available on the Solar Data Analysis Center's
<a href="http://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/eclipse/" target="_top">eclipse web pages</a>.
</P>

<h4 align=center>General Descriptive References</h4>

<P>
Any good encyclopedia or college-level textbook on astronomy has at
least a brief description of eclipses - what they are, why they occur,
and why they are of interest.  Examples of textbooks with particularly
complete discussions of eclipses are:

<P>
Abell, G. (later editions with Morrison, D. and Wolff, S.)
<em>Exploration of the Universe</em>; all editions.  New York:
Saunders.

<P>
Pasachoff, J. <em>Contemporary Astronomy</em>; all editions.  New York:
Saunders.

<p>
Astronomy magazines for the layman have frequent articles and columns on
eclipses, both general and specific.  Examples of these magazines are
<em>Sky & Telescope</em>, <em>Astronomy</em>, and <em>Griffith
Observer</em>.  There are others, foreign and domestic, as well as the
regular publications of astronomical societies.  Less frequently, there
are articles in magazines such as <em>Scientific American</em> and
<em>National Geographic</em>.

<h4 align=center>Canons</b></h4>

<div class="med">
<P> The primary use of eclipse "canons" is for chronological and
historical research, but they are also useful for long-term planning and
prediction.  This list on the following page provides the most
comprehensive works.

<P> Espenak, F. (1987).  <em>Fifty Year Canon of Solar Eclipses:
1986-2035</em>.  NASA Reference Publication 1178 Revised (also available
from Sky Publishing Corp., P.O.  Box 9111, Belmont, MA 02178-9111).  A
limited canon which is readily available.  It is divided into 4
sections:  a catalog of local circumstances at greatest eclipse, world
maps showing central paths, tabular data for the path of each central
eclipse, and a hemispherical map for each eclipse.  This canon is based
on Newcomb's Theory of the Sun an d the Improved Lunar Ephemeris.

<p> Espenak, F. (1989).  <em>Fifty Year Canon of Lunar Eclipses:
1986-2035</em>.  NASA Reference Publication 1216 (also available from
Sky Publishing Corp., see address above).  This is the companion volume
to Espenak's solar eclipse canon described above.  It is divided into 3
sections:  a catalog of circumstances, small global maps showing areas
of visibility, and world maps showing eclipse limits.  Diagrams showing
the progress of the Moon through the Earth's shadow are also provided
for each eclipse.

<p> Liu, Bao-Lin and Fiala, A. (1992).  <em>Canon of Lunar Eclipses 1500
BC to AD 3000</em>.  Richmond, VA:  Willmann-Bell.  In addition to the
canon itself, this book contains two detailed explanatory chapters on
lunar eclipses and several unique tables giving frequency distributions.
Eclipse visibility is determined by using the tabular data and base maps
in conjunction with transparent overlays.  Calculations are based on
modern ephemerides:  ELP2000-85 for the Moon and VSOP87 for the Sun.

<p> Meeus, J. and Mucke, J. (1983).  <em>Canon of Lunar Eclipses, -2002
to +2526</em>, 2nd ed.  Wien:  Astronomisches Buro.  This large volume
contains elements of 10,936 lunar eclipses (including penumbral
eclipses) in the form of a computer listing and small plotted charts.
It is based on Newcomb's Theory of the Sun and the Improved Lunar
Ephemeris.

<p> Mucke, J. and Meeus, J. (1983).  <em>Canon of Solar Eclipses, -2003
to +2526</em>.  Wien:  Astronomisches Buro.  This large volume contains
elements of 10,774 solar eclipses in the form of a computer listing and
small plotted charts.  It is based on Newcomb's Theory of the Sun and
the Improved Lunar Ephemeris.

<p> Oppolzer, T. von (1962).  <em>Canon of Eclipses (Canon der
Finsternisse)</em>.  New York:  Dover (reprint).  This is the classic
reference, originally published in 1887.  The Dover edition, translated
by Owen Gingerich, is also out-of-print.  The volume contains basic
tabular data and instructions for calculation for all solar and lunar
eclipses from 1207 BC to 2161 AD.  A set of maps show approximate tracks
of central line solar eclipses north of -30ƒ latitude.  The longitudes
are increasingly in error, as th e variation of the Earth's rotation was
not known at the time.  Other errors in the theories and tables are
known as well.  </p>

<h4 align=center>Historical Canons for Limited Areas</h4>

<P> Stephenson, F. and Houlden, M. (1985).  <em>Atlas of Historical
Eclipse Maps:  East Asia 1500BC-AD1900</em>.  Cambridge:  Cambridge
University Press.  This volume contains computer-generated maps and some
tabular material for East Asian central solar eclipses which occurred
during the time period specified in the title.  Each map shows the path
of the central phase of the eclipse and indicates the site of a major
Chinese city, usually the capital at the time.  The maps and data are
based on a modified j=2 lunar ephemeris and are corrected for the
long-term fluctuations in the Earth's rotation.

<p> Kudlek, M and Mickler, E. (1971).  <em>Solar and Lunar Eclipses of
the Ancient Near East from 3000 BC to 0, with Maps</em>.  Hamburg:
Verlag Butzon & Bercker Kevelaer.  This work, apparently produced in a
limited printing, will probably prove very difficult to obtain.  Tables
provide the local circumstances of the solar eclipses occurring during
the specified time period, for 7 important Near East cities.  The maps
indicate the locations of the important cities and the central paths of
the solar eclipses.  The lunar eclipse data is tabular.  Oppolzer's
methods were used to perform the calculations.

<h4 align=center>Theory and Mathematical Treatment</h4>

<p> <em>Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac</em> (1992).
Mill Valley, CA:  University Science Books.  This book provides a
detailed mathematical explanation of how the calculations in <em>The
Astronomical Almanac</em> are performed.  Chapter 8, which covers eclipses
of the Sun and Moon, is a completely revised and rewritten version of the
material contained in the 1961 <em>Explanatory Supplement</em>.
A <a href="publications/docs/related.html#expsup">description
and ordering information</a> is given in <b>Publications</b>.

<p> <em>Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris and the
American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac</em> (1961).  London:  H.M.
Stationery Office.  This volume contains the mathematical methods and
theories once used in the production of the national almanacs.  It is
now out of print and somewhat out of date.  Chapter 9 treats solar
eclipses, lunar eclipses, and transits of Mercury and Venus.

<p> Chauvenet, W. (1960).  <em>A Manual of Spherical and Practical
Astronomy</em>.  New York:  Dover (reprint).  This classic work,
originally published in two volumes in 1868, uses and expands upon
Bessel's methods for calculating eclipses.  For the most part, it forms
the basis for the material in the <em>Explanatory Supplement</em>.
Volume 1, Chapter X treats solar and lunar eclipses and transits.

<p> Green, R. (1985).  <em>Spherical Astronomy</em>.  Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press.  Chapter 18 of this book contains an
up-to-date vector/matrix treatment of the basic eclipse calculations
based on Bessel's formulation.  It is somewhat limited in its scope, but
very useful.

<P> Link, F. (1969).  <em>Eclipse Phenomena</em>.  New York:
Springer-Verlag.  This small volume contains a wealth of information on
lunar eclipses and transits of the inferior planets which is available
almost nowhere else.  It is concerned primarily with physical and
atmospheric effects of the eclipsing body, but also includes
computational and historical information.  In addition, it treats
eclipse and occultation effects involving other planets, natural and
artificial satellites, radio observations, and re lativistic effects.
</P>

<h4 align=center>Software</h4>

<P> There is a variety of commercially-produced software packages which
claim to perform some eclipse computations.  John Mosley of the Griffith
Observatory briefly reviewed a selection of this software in the March
1988 issue of <em>Sky & Telescope</em> magazine, page 306.  The U.S.
Naval Observatory can make no statements concerning the validity of the
methods used by these programs or the accuracy of their results as the
programs have not been evaluated by the staff.  Eclipse software is not
available from the U.S. Naval Observatory.</p>
