Motorcortex sends information to both, and both structures send informationright back to cortex via the thalamus.  (Remember, to get to cortexyou must go through thalamus.)  The output of the cerebellum isexcitatory, while the basal ganglia are inhibitory.  The balancebetween these two systems allows for smooth, coordinated movement,and a disturbance in either system will show up as movement disorders. </FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="cbell1.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>A.  The basal ganglia:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">What are the basal ganglia?  The name is confusing,as generally a ganglion is a collection of cell bodies <U>outside</U>the central nervous system.  Blame the early anatomists.  Thebasal ganglia are a collection of nuclei deep to the white matterof cerebral cortex.  The name includes:  <B>caudate, putamen,nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, subthalamicnucleus</B>, and historically the <B>claustrum </B>and the<B>amygdala</B>.  However, the claustrum and the amygdala do notreally deal with movement, nor are they interconnected with therest of the basal ganglia,  so they have been dropped from thissection.  Other groupings you may hear are the striatum (caudate+ putamen + nucleus accumbens), the corpus striatum (striatum+ globus pallidus), or the lenticular nucleus (putamen + globuspallidus), but these groupings obviously get confusing very quickly,so we will try to avoid them.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The anatomy of these structures should be a reviewfrom the "coronal and horizontal sections" lab.  Hereonce again are the basal ganglia as they appear when stained formyelin:<BR></FONT><CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">rostral section:</FONT></CENTER></TD><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">middle section:</FONT></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><IMG SRC="cbell2.gif"></CENTER></TD><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><IMG SRC="cbell3.gif"></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2 WIDTH=504><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">caudal section:</FONT></CENTER><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="cbell4.gif"></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino"> </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">An alternate stain is the acetylcholinesterase (AChE)stain.  This technique stains for the enzyme that degrades acetylcholine(ACh), a major neurotransmitter.  Areas which use ACh generallystain darkly.  Here is a section through monkey brain, stainedfor AChE.</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="cbell5.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">You can see that the caudate and putamen are stained,while the globus pallidus remains fairly pale.  This emphasizestheir different functions and connections.  And those are...?<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>B. Different functions and connections:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The relationships between the nuclei of the basalganglia are by no means completely understood.  When dealing withthe brain, you may sometimes be tempted to think that everythingis connected to everything else.  Take heart, some fairly simplegeneralizations and schematics can be drawn.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The caudate and putamen receive most of the inputfrom cerebral cortex; in this sense they are the <U>doorway intothe basal ganglia</U>.  There are some regional differences: forexample, medial caudate and nucleus accumbens receive their inputfrom frontal cortex and limbic areas, and are implicated morein thinking and schizophrenia than in moving and motion disorders. The caudate and putamen are reciprocally interconnected withthe substantia nigra, but send most of their output to the globuspallidus (see diagram below).<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The substantia nigra can be divided into two parts:the <B>substantia nigra pars compacta</B> (SNpc) and the <B>substantianigra pars reticulata</B> (SNpr).  The SNpc receives input fromthe caudate and putamen, and sends information right back.  TheSNpr also receives input from the caudate and putamen, but sendsit outside the basal ganglia to control head and eye movements. The SNpc is the more famous of the two, as it produces dopamine,which is critical for normal movement.  The SNpc degenerates inParkinson's disease,  but the condition can be treated by givingoral dopamine precursors.    <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The globus pallidus can also be divided into twoparts: the <B>globus pallidus externa</B> (GPe) and the <B>globuspallidus interna</B> (GPi).  Both receive input from the caudateand putamen, and both are in communication with the subthalamicnucleus.  It is the GPi, however, that sends the major inhibitoryoutput from the basal ganglia back to thalamus.  The GPi alsosends a few projections to an area of midbrain (the PPPA), presumablyto assist in postural control.  <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">This schematic summarizes the connections of thebasal ganglia as described above.  <BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="cbell6.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Although there are many different neurotransmittersused within the basal ganglia (principally ACh, GABA, and dopamine),the overall effect on thalamus is inhibitory.  The function ofthe basal ganglia is often described in terms of a "brakehypothesis".  To sit still, you must put the brakes on allmovements except those reflexes that maintain an upright posture. To move, you must apply a brake to some postural reflexes, andrelease the brake on voluntary movement.  In such a complicatedsystem, it is apparent that small disturbances can throw the wholesystem out of whack, often in unpredictable ways.  The deficitstend to fall into one of two categories: the presence of extraneousunwanted movements or an absence or difficulty with intended movements.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>C. Lesions of the basal ganglia:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Lesions in specific nuclei tend to produce characteristicdeficits.  One well-known disorder is <B>Parkinson's disease</B>,which is the slow and steady loss of dopaminergic neurons in SNpc. An instant Parkinson-like syndrome will result if these neuronsare damaged.  This happened several years ago to an unfortunategroup of people who took some home-brewed Demerol in search ofa high.  It was contaminated by a very nasty byproduct, MPTP ,whichselectively zapped the SNpc neurons.  The three symptoms usuallyassociated with Parkinson's are <B>tremor</B>, <B>rigidity</B>,and <B>bradykinesia</B>.  The tremor is most apparent at rest. Rigidity is a result of simultaneous contraction of flexors andextensors, which tends to lock up the limbs.  Bradykinesia, or&quot;slow movement&quot;, is a difficulty initiating voluntarymovement, as though the brake cannot be released. <BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Huntington's disease</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">,or <B>chorea</B>, is a hereditary disease of unwanted movements. It results from degeneration of the caudate and putamen, andproduces continuous dance-like movements of the face and limbs. A related disorder is <B>hemiballismus</B>, flailing movementsof one arm and leg, which is caused by damage (i.e., stroke) ofthe subthalamic nucleus.  <BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>D.  The cerebellum:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The cerebellum is involved in the coordination ofmovement.  A simple way to look at its purpose is that it compareswhat you thought you were going to do (according to motor cortex)with what is actually happening down in the limbs (according toproprioceptive feedback), and corrects the movement if there isa problem.  The cerebellum is also partly responsible for motorlearning, such as riding a bicycle.  Unlike the cerebrum, whichworks entirely on a contralateral basis, the <U>cerebellum worksipsilaterally</U>.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The cerebellum ("little brain") has convolutionssimilar to those of cerebral cortex, only the folds are much smaller. Like the cerebrum, the cerebellum has an outer cortex, an innerwhite matter, and deep nuclei below the white matter. <BR></FONT><CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><IMG SRC="cbell7.gif"></CENTER></TD><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><IMG SRC="cbell8.gif"></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=252><BR><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Cat cerebellum, sagittal section</FONT></CENTER></TD><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino"> </FONT></CENTER><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Single folium, enlarged</FONT></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino"> <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">If we enlarge a single fold of cerebellum, or a <B>folium</B>,we can begin to see the organization of cell types.  The outermostlayer of the cortex is called the <B>molecular layer</B>, andis nearly cell-free.  Instead it is occupied mostly by axons anddendrites.  The layer below that is a monolayer of large cellscalled <B>Purkinje cells</B>, central players in the circuitryof the cerebellum.  Below the Purkinje cells is a dense layerof tiny neurons called <B>granule cells</B>.  Finally, in thecenter of each folium is the white matter, all of the axons travelinginto and out of the folia. <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">These cell types are hooked together in stereotypicalways throughout the cerebellum.  <BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="cbell9.gif"><BR></CENTER><CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD WIDTH=252><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Mossy fibers</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino"> are one of two main sources of input to the cerebellar cortex.  A mossy fiber is an axon terminal that ends in a large, bulbous swelling.  These mossy fibers enter the granule cell layer and synapse on the dendrites of granule cells (right); in fact the granule cells reach out with little "claws" to grasp the terminals.  The granule cells then send their axons up to the molecular layer, where they end in a T and run parallel to the surface. For this reason these axons are called <B>parallel fibers</B>.  The parallel fibers synapse on the huge dendritic arrays of the Purkinje cells.</FONT></TD><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><IMG SRC="cbell10.gif"></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2 WIDTH=504><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">However, the individual parallel fibers are not a strong drive to the Purkinje cells.  The Purkinje cell dendrites fan out within a plane, like the splayed fingers of one hand.  If you were to turn a Purkinje cell to the side, it would have almost no width at all.  The parallel fibers run <U>perpendicular</U> to the Purkinje cells, so that they only make contact once as they pass through the dendrites.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">   </FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="cbell11.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Although each parallel fiber touches each Purkinjecell only once, the thousands of parallel fibers working togethercan drive the Purkinje cells to fire like mad.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The second main type of input to the folium is the<B>climbing fiber</B>.  The climbing fibers go straight to thePurkinje cell layer and snake up the Purkinje dendrites, likeivy climbing a trellis.  Each climbing fiber associates with onlyone Purkinje cell, but when the climbing fiber fires, it provokesa large response in the Purkinje cell.    <BR></FONT><CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD WIDTH=252><BR><BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="cbell12.gif"></CENTER></TD><TD WIDTH=252><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The Purkinje cell (left) compares and processes the varying inputs it gets, and finally sends its own axons out through the white matter and down to the <B>deep nuclei</B>.

The three deep nuclei are responsible for sending excitatory output back to the thalamus, as well as to postural and vestibular centers.</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=252><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">There are a few other cell types in cerebellar cortex, which can all be lumped into the category of inhibitory interneuron.

Inputs and outputs of the cerebellum:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The cerebellum operates in 3's: there are 3 highwaysleading in and out of the cerebellum, there are 3 main inputs,and there are 3 main outputs from 3 deep nuclei.  They are:<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The 3 highways are the <B>peduncles</B>, or "stalks". There are 3 pairs: the <B>inferior</B>, <B>middle</B>, and <B>superiorpeduncles</B>.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The 3 inputs are:  Mossy fibers from the <B>spinocerebellar</B>pathways, climbing fibers from the <B>inferior olive</B>, andmore mossy fibers from the <B>pons</B>, which are carrying informationfrom <B>cerebral cortex</B>.  The mossy fibers from the spinalcord have come up ipsilaterally, so they do not need to cross. The fibers coming down from cerebral cortex, however, DO needto cross (remember the cerebrum is concerned with the oppositeside of the body, unlike the cerebellum).  These fibers synapsein the pons (hence the huge block of fibers in the cerebral peduncleslabeled "corticopontine"), cross, and enter the cerebellumas mossy fibers.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The 3 deep nuclei are the <B>fastigial</B>, <B>interposed</B>,and <B>dentate nuclei</B>.  The fastigial nucleus is primarilyconcerned with balance, and sends information mainly to vestibularand reticular nuclei.  The dentate and interposed nuclei are concernedmore with voluntary movement, and send axons mainly to thalamusand the red nucleus.<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="cbell14.gif"><BR><BR></CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=#0000FF FACE="Palatino"><A HREF="http://thalamus.wustl.edu/course">RETURN TO HOME PAGE</A><BR></FONT></B></BODY></HTML>
