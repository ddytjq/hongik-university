<P>
Following the BATSE's discovery the old galactic disk paradigm was
practically eliminated as it was in a direct conflict with the observed 
distribution.  The two competing distance scales emerged: one was the 
galactic corona and the other was cosmological.  The nature of the arguments 
leading to these two possibilities was (and still is) very different.
<P>
There is no evidence in the BATSE (or any other) data which would point 
to the galactic corona as the site of gamma-ray bursters.
The proposed distribution is unprecedented in that there is no other
observed population of sources in that region.  It requires 
the bursters to have constant space density out to a distance
of at least 30 kiloparsecs away from the center, so that our 8 kiloparsec
offset from the center would not be noticed.  A typical burster is now supposed
to be at <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_3109_tex2html_wrap296.gif"> kiloparsecs, a factor of 1,000 farther away than
in the old galactic disk paradigm, and therefore it has to be <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_3109_tex2html_wrap278.gif">
times as luminous.  All models ever developed for the disk paradigm are
useless, including the models that so nicely explained the spectral
lines reported by the GINGA team.  The main problem faced with all coronal
models is the need to explain their distribution,
or more precisely how gamma-ray bursters come to be in an area where nothing
else is.  It is paradoxical that the galactic distribution proposed for
the bursters is designed so as to erase any trace of the galactic origin
in the observed distribution.
<P>
Ever since the extended corona was first proposed as the site for gamma-ray
bursters the emphasis was on the radial extent and sphericity,
hence the popularity of the very high velocity neutron stars which can 
go out as far as we please.  But the really difficult problem with the
coronal idea is not its outer extent, but the size of its inner core, the
region over which the number density of the bursters has to be uniform,
independent of location (Paczynski 1991, Hakkila et al. 1994, and 
references therein).  In order not to see our 8 kiloparsec offset
from the galactic center that core must be at least 30 kiloparsec in
radius.  In spite of the many papers written about the coronal models I am
not aware of a satisfactory explanation of the extent of this uniform
density region.  The observed isotropy of the strong bursts (Atteia et al.
1987) combined with the observed radial uniformity of the PVO bursts
(Fenimore et al. 1992, 1993, 
and references therein) demands that there is a region around us which
has a constant number density of gamma-ray bursters.  If that region
is in our galaxy it must be at least 60 kiloparsecs in diameter.
This is the most serious problem faced by any galactic corona model.
<P>
The nature of the problem is twofold.  First, there is nothing else observed
to have so extended constant density volume.  Second, the galactic mass
is concentrated to its center and this makes it very difficult,
perhaps impossible, to design a theoretical distribution which could
be made and kept uniform within such a big sphere.
<P>
The observed distribution is automatically satisfied if we adopt
cosmological distance scale: all objects detectable at cosmological
distances are distributed isotropically in the sky, and the number
density of all of them appears to decrease at sufficiently large distances
as a consequence of the redshift.  The uniform density region in
almost any cosmological scenario is a few Gigaparsec in extent.
The observed distribution is the most important argument for the 
cosmological distance scale to gamma-ray bursters.
<P>
There are plenty of models, or rather very schematic scenarios for either
distance scale.  As the sources are clearly non-thermal the diversity of
models is limited only by the skill and imagination of theoreticians.
This is not a unique situation.  To
the contrary: this is a typical situation.  It is pretty much 
the same with all other non-thermal sources, like radio pulsars
or quasars, even though we know the distance to those objects.  Once we have
to abandon the constraints of thermal equilibrium and feel free to add
magnetic fields, turbulence, relativistic particles,
and other ``high energy'' ingredients,
it is next to impossible to come up with a unique and highly quantitative
description of what is going on.  This is not to say that we should not
try to invent new non-thermal models.  In the process we find a large variety
of interesting possibilities, and perhaps at some point we shall find 
a testable model which will turn out to be correct.  I do not expect
this to happen as long as we do not know for sure how far away the bursters
are, and therefore we do not know what the energy requirements are.
I am not aware of a single case in the history of astrophysics in which 
a distance to any non-thermal source was reliably established using any 
non-thermal emission models.  Unfortunately, even when the
distance is known it is still difficult or impossible to decide which
non-thermal model is correct.
<P>
The distribution of radio pulsars in the sky, as well as the effect of the
interstellar medium on the propagation of pulsar emission, revealed their
distance almost instantly.  Yet, we still do not have a quantitative model
for their radio and gamma-ray emission.  The distance to
quasars was found when their emission line spectra revealed their 
redshifts, and some of them were found at the centers of galaxies.  However,
even though there is no longer a significant dispute over their distance,
we still do not have a quantitative model of their non-thermal emission 
which extends from long wave radio to GeV gamma-rays.  Of course there
are plenty of models of radio pulsar and quasar emission, but none
of them is generally accepted, and no consensus is in sight after
three decades of hard work.
<P>
Perhaps the most devastating argument against using models
to determine the distance scale is the history of gamma-ray bursts.
As far as I can see the galactic disk origin with its distance scale
of <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_3109_tex2html_wrap296.gif"> parsecs has been practically abandoned in spite of the fact
that most theoreticians used to be convinced it was correct.
More models were developed, and more theoretical papers were written
for the distance of <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_3109_tex2html_wrap296.gif"> parsecs,
than for all other distances combined.  Yet, those models developed over
almost two decades had to be abandoned because of the BATSE observations.
In spite of so many very diverse 
possibilities no bursts were convincingly found to be at <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_3109_tex2html_wrap296.gif"> 
parsecs.  I do not think the quality of models developed for the distance of
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_3109_tex2html_wrap296.gif"> kiloparsecs or <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_3109_tex2html_wrap178.gif"> Gigaparsec is any higher than
was the quality of the disk models: none is nearly good enough to be really
trusted.  I am not aware of any reason why the physics of the new models
is superior to the physics of the old models.  My conclusion is that
the models of gamma-ray bursters as currently available are useless for
distance determination.  Each model is designed to work at some particular
distance, be it 100 parsecs, 100 kiloparsecs, or 1 Gigaparsec.
In fact there are many competing models for every possible distance.
Even when the distance is finally established by model independent means we
still shall not know which model, if any, is correct, as is still the
case for quasars.
<P>
How can one determine the distance if
one does not know what it is that one tries to determine the distance to?
In fact, this is how astronomy usually works.
The stars were known for millenia and they were used for variety of 
purposes, from navigation to astrology, while nobody knew what they 
were, or even how far away they were.  About 150 years ago
the distance to the first star, 61 Cygni, was measured
using the Earth's motion around the sun (Bessel 1838).
Gradually, not only many stars had their distances
measured, but also the size of the Galaxy was estimated.
Still, it was not known what makes the stars shine, and no
quantitative stellar models existed.
Finally, some 60 years ago the energy of the 
stars was explained in terms of thermonuclear reactions and
the first quantitative stellar models were built, often
refining the distance.
<P>
When a new class of objects is discovered it is a standard procedure to
estimate the distance from the observed distribution.  It is always
clear that if the sources are concentrated to the galactic plane or the
galactic center then their distances must not be very different from
a kiloparsec.  If the distribution is isotropic then they must be either
very close, at <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_3109_tex2html_wrap296.gif"> parsecs, or very far, more than <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_3109_tex2html_wrap296.gif">
Megaparsecs away.
Often new types of objects, or even a diffuse background which may not
be resolved into sources, are separated into galactic and extragalactic 
components on the basis of their sky distribution.
The same procedure can be applied to gamma-ray bursts.  And the
verdict is: the distance scale seems to be cosmological.  Has this been
proven?  Certainly not.   Gamma-ray bursts are so enigmatic that in fact
they may be a manifestation of an entirely unknown phenomenon, they may be
events on an unknown and unprecedented type of objects, with a new and
unprecedented distribution in space.  We must have a truly firm determination
of their distance before we may hope to understand what they are and
how they burst.
<P>
What can be done to to prove the distance scale?  Some steps have already 
been taken.  The cosmological distance scale is suggested by the fact that
the observed distribution is not only isotropic but also appears to be
bounded.  The latter effect comes about because the distant sources are
supposed to be
redshifted.  If they are redshifted we should look for additional
observational consequences, of which at least two are promising.  First,
the redshift affects not only the wavelength of every photon but also
the apparent duration of every burst (Paczynski 1992, Piran 1992).
Second, the spectra are not strict power laws, they are somewhat curved.
Therefore, a redshifted spectrum should appear somewhat softer (Paczynski 
1992).  The time dilation effect was apparent in some correlations,
but the possibility of the redshift interpretation was not noticed
for a while (Kouveliotou et al. 1992, Paciesas et al 1992).  Recently,
both effects were reported to be present in the data (Lestrade et al 1992,
Norris et al. 1994, 1995, Nemiroff et al. 1994, Wijers &amp; Paczynski 1994)
at approximately 4 <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_3109_tex2html_wrap294.gif"> level.  Some doubts remain (Mitrofanov et al.
1994, Band 1994b, Fenimore &amp; Bloom 1994)
and it will take some time until the consensus is
reached on the presence or absence of the effect, and on its interpretation.
At this time the case for the presence of the cosmological redshift
effect in the weak BATSE bursts looks promising, but it is not proven yet.
The case for cosmological redshift will be stronger when
the two methods, the time dilation and the spectral softening,
are shown to agree.
<P>
What about a variety of arguments advanced against the cosmological distance
scale?  Let me list some of the more common.  The lines reported
by the GINGA experiment, and previously claimed by the KONUS
as well as some other experiments, are a common objection to the
cosmological distances.  I think the
reality of the lines is far from proven.  Only two fully algorithmic
searches were done for the lines: one for the SMM data (Messina &amp; Share
1992), the other for the BATSE data (Palmer et al. 1994), and no line was 
found in either of the searches.
All lines ever claimed were found using subjective human judgement, and
at best a posteriori statistical analysis was performed.
<P>
Let us suppose the lines turn out to be real.  There is no unique way to 
interpret them.  For example, at least three papers were written pointing 
to gravitational femtolensing as a possible cause if the bursters
are at cosmological distances (Gould 1992, Stanek et al. 1993,
Ulmer &amp; Goodman 1995).  This explanation
was never pushed very hard because the confidence in the
reality of the lines is not very high.  Why spend time explaining
something which may not exist?  In any case, the only
models explaining the lines in terms of cyclotron absorption required
the bursters to be at <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_3109_tex2html_wrap296.gif"> parsecs (cf. Lamb 1992, and references
therein).  None of
those models can be adapted to work at either galactic corona or 
cosmological distance scales, as the bursting material is expected
to expand relativistically in either of those two cases.  If the
lines are proven to exist a new explanation and new models have to
be developed for any of the two distance scales currently under
consideration.  The lines, even if they exist, will not resolve
the galactic corona vs cosmology controversy.
<P>
Huge energies required by cosmological gamma-ray bursts are often pointed
out as a problem.  This argument was often used in the past against the
extragalactic distance to M31 and the cosmological distance to quasars.
A term ``supernova'' was even invented many decades ago to ridicule the
possibility that a stellar explosion observed in M31 as S Andromedae
might be as powerful as required by the supposedly extragalactic origin.
Today we know that supernovae are indeed very powerful, that M31 is
another galaxy, outside of our own, and cosmological distances to
the quasars are no longer seriously disputed.
<P>
I think it might be useful to point out that in astronomy
``large'' is not less plausible than ``small''.  In fact, many
types of objects and events are known to be possible only if they
are ``astronomically large''.  For example, it is well established
that thermonuclear burning of hydrogen may be sustained in a
self-gravitating object only if its mass is larger than <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_3109_tex2html_wrap298.gif">
grams.  The only known neutrino bursts, those from supernovae,
are on a scale of <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_3109_tex2html_wrap300.gif"> ergs, all released within
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_3109_tex2html_wrap306.gif"> seconds.  Everything
we know in our universe is very low on energy compared with
the Big Bang.  Incidentally, the term ``Big Bang'' was also invented
to ridicule the concept.  Therefore, the energetics of gamma-ray
bursts is not a distance indicator and cannot be used against them
being at cosmological distances.
<P>
The repetition is well established for the X-ray bursts and for the soft 
gamma repeaters (all three of them) but it is a controversial issue 
for gamma-ray bursts (cf. Band 1994a, and references therein).
The repetition, if established, will be very important for the understanding
of gamma-ray bursts, but it has no relation to the distance scale as
long as we do not know what the gamma-ray bursters really are.
For example, Ostriker (1992) thinks the bursters are at cosmological 
distances and he expects them to repeat.
<P>
A common feature of all anti-cosmological arguments is that all of
them are model dependent.  The author(s) always have some specific model
in mind when a claim is made that the model could not possibly
give rise to a burst at a distance of a few Gigaparsecs.  And usually
the argument is correct, but only for that particular model, or
for a particular set of models.  There never was a proof that no
model could possibly produce a burst
at any specific distance scale.  Also, there never was a model that
could quantitatively demonstrate that it must produce a burst.  Notice,
that even though so many sophisticated models were developed for the
distance scale of <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_3109_tex2html_wrap296.gif"> parsecs, we have no observational
evidence that there are any events of the type described with those
models.  My conclusion is: we have to admit we do not know what gamma-ray
bursters are and we do not know what makes them burst.  Therefore,
if we want to determine their distance we must use a model independent
method.  And this is perfectly normal: this is how distances are
established in astronomy.
<P>
There is a complication with the cosmological distance scale which should
be mentioned here.  All types of objects observed at cosmological
distances, quasars, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies, are known to
evolve: their typical luminosity and their number density
observed at large redshifts are different than local.
The population of gamma-ray bursters may also evolve.
If there were no bursters in the early universe, then the observed 
distribution appears bounded because there are no bursters
at large distances, and not because the redshift made the
distant bursters very dim, and pushed them below the detection
threshold.  In this case the weakest BATSE events could be
relatively nearby, and their redshifts may be too small to measure.
What is interpreted as a redshift might instead be a
consequence of evolution.  This is a rather ugly possibility,
but unfortunately it cannot be ruled out as long as we do not understand 
gamma-ray bursters.  The case for cosmological redshift will be stronger 
when the time dilation and the spectral softening are found to be consistent
with each other.
