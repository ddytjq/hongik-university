<h2>
<a NAME="benefits"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A. Benefits</font></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Regard a Personal Computer (PC) as a means
of storing, changing and presenting documents, information, images and
sounds.&nbsp; Regard the Internet as the largest possible publicity medium
and library that potentially anyone can access at anytime, anywhere in
the world. It is possible to combine the power of the PC and the Internet
to enormous advantage. The benefits are:</font></b>
<ol>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Stored documents can be used to create
new or revised documents, which avoids duplication of effort to re-key
those parts of documents which have not altered e.g. make changes to last
year’s document to create this year’s.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The ease of making changes also encourages
higher standards.&nbsp; The look of a printed document influences the reader’s
first impression .&nbsp; Good presentation will encourage the reader, which
may be vital where <a href="guideline11.html">Magazines</a> are seeking
to encourage an active membership, or a Proposal is seeking a commercial
sponsor.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Documents can be automatically checked
for accuracy of spelling, the quality of the grammar and credibility of
values in the data, etc.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Items can be collated from a variety of
sources, or individuals, but edited to have a consistent size or form of
presentation. Modern software applications (or programs) will import documents
created using other software applications. For example, <i>Microsoft Publisher</i>
or <i>Quark Express</i> may be used to create the clubs magazine with documents
sourced from many parties produced with a variety of software applications.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Electronic mail (e-mail) allows easy contribution
of articles at any time without the need for transcription from paper.
Even the “snail mail” postal submission of articles on floppy disk is an
advantage over traditional paper based methods.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Changes can be made to data, and the implications
of changes recalculated quickly and reliably.&nbsp; For example, a spreadsheet
can be reused time and time again to perform tedious calculations on different
sets of data. Equally, changes to parts of documents can be made and the
revised version reproduced quickly without re-inventing the wheel. The
generation of time-cards for rallies is an ideal candidate for a spreadsheet
applications, especially “summertime” time-cards.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many clubs outsource the printing of their
magazine: printers commonly accept the original on floppy disk or even
via e-mail which helps to speed-up production and cut costs. The days of
poor quality printing using a worn out <i>Gesetner</i> in the garden shed
are over!</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Shared access to information can be made
easier by the exchange of disks, e-mail or via the club’s Internet web
site.&nbsp; It is possible to create a section of the club web site which
only the committee can access using a password.</font></b></li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a NAME="costs"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">B. Costs</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Acquisition is a prime candidate for sponsorship,
if you have something to offer in return.&nbsp; Information Technology
is a competitive market, requiring a high profile and advertising.&nbsp;
A PC system only costs about the same as a 10cm line advertisement in a
Regional Newspaper.... The cost of acquisition will involve not only the
hardware, but also the applications software to make the hardware do the
tasks required.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Typical PC systems (especially
those bought by mail order) include a colour ink-jet printer, document
scanner, telephone modem, colour monitor, a high capacity hard disk drive,
CD-ROM drive, joystick, a powerful processor and lots of memory. The prices
are constantly decreasing and the abilities of the systems increasing.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Always buy the highest
specification system you can afford as three years is reckoned to be the
standard life of any PC system before it needs upgrading: such is the pace
of improvement.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Purchase price usually
includes a one-year warranty for Parts &amp; Labour.&nbsp; As with all
electrical goods, all the maintenance companies will wish to sell you long
term maintenance (3 years) paid in advance.&nbsp; Do you know in advance
that they will still be trading for the years that you pay for...</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Important files should
be “backed-up” frequently: floppy disks are very cheap and backup copies
should be kept apart (i.e. another location) from the PC in case of fire,
theft or some other problem which damages the PCs hard disk. The clubs
Internet web site provides an additional method for storing important files.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Printers consume “ink”
in some form, usually cartridges or toner packs in the case of high quality
laser printers.&nbsp; The actual cost will increase with the quality of
the output required, but consumable costs of&nbsp; 1p - 5p per page of
A4 are not untypical. Some clubs will directly print their magazines: a
black and white laser printer may prove cost effective compared with going
to an external printer.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Printers also consume paper.&nbsp;
Rejecting drafts to improve quality is best done by pre-viewing the output
on the monitor, prior to incurring the cost of consumables.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The skills required to
use a PC system are a balance between buying products which one volunteer
can use to good effect with their existing skills, and its ease of use
to allow others to gain the skills necessary to use the chosen system.&nbsp;
With voluntary effort involving a range of individuals over time, remember
the repeated cost of training new users. Many local evening classes exist
and self-help video tapes can provide training.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs of IT products are
falling all the time.&nbsp; It is not necessary to purchase all the elements
up-front.&nbsp; Establish an acquisition plan in phases, allowing the benefits
to pay back each phase before further investment or sponsorship. The document
scanner is the lowest priority but will enable the addition of photographs
and logos to documents and conversion of old documents into a word processable
form.</font></b>
<h2>
<a NAME="options"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">C. Technical Options</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Hardware for most Clubs will be based on
Personal Computers (PC) of the IBM “clone” type or Apple Macintosh. Each
form of hardware has an “operating system” associated with it which is
the software that obeys the commands users give when they press keys and
click mouses. Typically, the PC will use some flavour of <i>Microsoft Windows</i>
and the Macintosh will use
<i>Mac-OS</i><sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>to
achieve the same ends.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; TV monitors are extremely
poor quality when compared to those used for PC systems.&nbsp; Most leading
software could not be supported by a TV monitor.&nbsp; The dominant market
standard is currently described as the “SVGA”&nbsp; Monitor and provides
very high quality rendering of any graphics.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Memory (RAM) size can be
increased after purchase, 16Mb for Windows 95 is the lowest recommended
limit and 32Mb would be optimum. Additional memory is very cheap indeed
and is well worth the expenditure. More memory generally provides more
performance benefit compared with a faster CPU.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Hard disk storage of 2Gb
is considered to be a lower limit on PC systems. As with memory, the cost
of a very high capacity (>4Gb) hard disk is relatively&nbsp; cheap and
easy to install and will allow the PC to perform more smoothly. Always
try to get the largest disk you can afford as modern software always requires
more disk space than the previous version!</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The type of Processor or
CPU&nbsp; dictates the speed of performance coupled with adequate RAM.
Always get the fastest (measured in MHz) processor available at the time
of purchase. The Intel Pentium series of processors offer very fast performance
although other manfacturers such as Cyrix produced comparable products.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides exchanging files
via floppy disks, new PCs are equipped to be “Internet ready” which means
that by plugging the PC into an ordinary telephone line (or even better
an "ISDN" line) files may be exchanged with distance being no object and
calls costed at the local call charge rate.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Computers in the same building
can use Local Area Networks (LANs), such as “<i>Novell</i>”, “<i>Windows
NT</i>”&nbsp; or “<i>AppleTalk</i><sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>” to
gain shared access in an Event HQ, Press office, etc.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Software producer
needs to offer more functions than their competitors, hence each is different
to use but they will have similar functionality.&nbsp; Although they have
basic ability to exchange files with their competitors’ products, the full
benefit of re-using and exchanging files is only available to a group of
users of the same application package.&nbsp; If there is to be co-operation
and exchange of information, it would be beneficial to agree to use the
same software product such as
<i>Microsoft Office</i>.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Printers enable a hard-copy
to be made of the document and, as with all computer hardware the prices
are dropping constantly. The choice will usually be for a colour ink-jet
printer and/or a black and white laser printer. Colour laser printers are
still beyond the reach of most.</font></b>
<h2>
<a NAME="applications"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">D. Applications</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Word-Processing at its simplest will allow
files to be edited to create new versions, and minimise the amount of typing
which needs to be done to prepare letters, Regulations, Marshals Instructions,
Newsletters, Sponsorship Proposals, Minutes of meetings, etc.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Those software options
costing the extra &pound;100 - &pound;300 also offer pre-print viewing
of each page through a preview option&nbsp; or "WYSIWYG" (<i>what you see
is what you get</i>).</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Spreadsheets allow tables of figures
to be automatically calculated, and are the simplest method by which a
list of figures can be listed out and compared to others.&nbsp; Most offer
graphs in addition to tables of figures.&nbsp; Improved management of Clubs
can provide early pay-back e.g. <a href="guideline4.html">Budgets versus
Actuals for Event expenditure</a>.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Integrated application
packages&nbsp; such as <i>Microsoft Office</i> or <i>Lotus Smartsuite</i>
offer a word Processing, spreadsheet, database, presentation and other
applications built into one application suite which works well together.
It is easily possible to “import” documents produced with one type of application
into another. <i>Microsoft Works</i> is a cheaper alternative to Office
and does most things adequately well.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Desk Top Publishing (DTP)
is the next logical step from word-processing. The role of DTP is to aid
the presentation on a page of text, data and images files.&nbsp; The frequently
used commands are therefore associated with cut / paste and photographic&nbsp;
layout, and less with the editing and checking of the accuracy of the actual
text / data itself&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (the role of Word-Processing
and Spreadsheet software).</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Frequent needs for high-impact
headings, and the increased use of photographs in documents will mark the
need to acquire specialist DTP application software.&nbsp; At the same
time it is likely that a document scanner will be beneficial, operating
like a photocopier which produces a file (instead of a hard copy) which
can be imported into a DTP application.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="guideline4.html">Club
Treasurers</a> can benefit from the workload saved by a recognised Accounting
package although a modern spreadsheet package will provide all the required
functionality. Across a series of Events, each using Spreadsheet data,
an Accounts package will provide accurate VAT records, balance a variety
of accounts, and provide consolidated financial reports normally landed
heavily on the shoulders of the keenest or financially-qualified Committee
Member.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Mailing lists are available
as a side-line to most word-processing applications, however there are
specialist packages which not only maintain the Name / Address but also
the date of the last contact and background notes.&nbsp; Such contact /
prospect packages are invaluable for canvassing
<a href="guideline5.html">membership</a>
and commercial sponsorship contacts.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Every Event requires some
form of Results Service, to the Organisers, Competitors, Media and Spectators.&nbsp;
The same PC used for letters, minutes and accounts for most of its life
can move to Event HQ to fulfil a different role for a Clerk of the Course.
The “laptop” or “notebook” PC is especially convenient for this role.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Most Events can rely on
Spreadsheet-based Results, others on the voluntary effort of their neighbourhood
Programmer.&nbsp; Those who have specialist motor sport Results packages
available for sale or rental usually ensure the RACMSA know of their existence.</font></b>
<h3>
<a NAME="internet"></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica">D.a. Use of the Internet</font></h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Allows access to the world largest searchable
dynamic information source for both reading from and publishing to.&nbsp;
The lnternet is available 24 hours a day, potentially from anywhere in
the world.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Allows the sending of messages
(e-mail) to anyone with an e-mail address anytime, anywhere in the world.&nbsp;
As well as sending basic text, it is easy to 'attach' a document produced
by a particular application such as a word processing, spreadsheet package
or database.&nbsp; This allows committee members to exchange documents
conveniently.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Allows anyone to join '<a href="../../other.html">mailing
lists</a>' dedicated to discussing particular topics.&nbsp; Anyone may
post a question to the list, it will be distributed to all those on the
list and see it answered by a number of people in a few hours.&nbsp; Mailing
lists use e-mail as the post and delivery mechanism.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Allows anyone to join '<a href="../../other.html">newsgroups</a>'
which allow the following of a 'threaded' discussion on specialist topics
and also the contribution to the discussions.&nbsp; Newsgroups are accessed
via a variety of mechanisms but a web browser is the most convenient.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Encourages submission of
magazine articles via email: the psychological barrier of the obligatory
envelope and stamp is removed.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Enables collaborative and
concurrent working on major projects.</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="web"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">D.b. Publishing a Club
Web Site</font></b></h3>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Allows the club to reach an constantly
growing, enormous audience of potential new members: most schools and Universities
have direct connections to the lnternet.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Enables existing members
to be kept infomed about all aspects of its activities: future event calendars
should be maintained so that members do not need to telephone committee
members.&nbsp; Include map references for event locations.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Allows the club to publicise
its events much more widely and cheaply than conventional paper based advertising
with no publishing deadlines to comply with.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Can generate extra income
from advertisers and sponsors (compare with standard magazine based copy)</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enables a central
repository for club documentation, standard forms and archive.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generates a focal
point for the club activities which can be used to advantage with local
media and potential sponsors.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sets the club apart
from competing organisations for potential new members: motor sport has
to compete for members along with all the other modern activities on offer.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is generally agreed that a web site
worth having has the following qualities:</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is easily found:
there is no point designing a state-of-the-art site if it can not be found:
seek advice on how to get your site 'indexed' and 'linked' to.&nbsp; The
clubs 'webmaster' should develop links from all the relevant local government
sites and those listing clubs and societies.&nbsp; A <a href="../../uk_clubs.html">full
directory of UK Motor Clubs</a> may be found on one the leading UK Motor
Sport web sites at <a href="../../index.html">http://www.ukmotorsport.com/</a>
along with the MSAs on-line '<a href="../starting/index.html">Starting
Motor Sport</a>'.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The site must be kept updated:
an out-of-date one is worse than not having one at all.&nbsp; Once the
initial site building has been achieved, allow one hour a week for maintainence
and development work.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; Has the full support of
the whole committee.&nbsp; The magazine editor, press officer and public
relations officer especially should play a prominent role in contributing
to the sites content and development.&nbsp; A full committee meeting dedicated
<i>only</i> to the web site should take place early on in its development.&nbsp;
The'webmaster' may be one of these officers or a stand-alone committee
post: maybe a member who has expressed an interest in the lnternet can
be encouraged to take on this relatively new role.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is complimentary
to the clubs magazine rather than being its competitor.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The site is easily navigable
and clearly laid out so that all viewers (especially newcomers) will readily
find the information they are after: various methods of providing menus
and contents lists exist.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The content is interesting,
relevant and varied: content is much more important than appearance however
the site should be tidy and eye-catching to attract the younger audience.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; The site loads quickly:
use of graphics and images should be carefully considered as inappropriate
use of images substantially increases the time taken for the pages to appear
on the screen: the webmaster should seek advice.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adds 'value' to the
club by allowing anyone to discover the character of the club and remove
barriers to membership: an on-line membership form is readily achieved.&nbsp;
Seek advice before accepting credit card details on-line.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New material is tagged
as such and revision dates are given for exising pages.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does not make-up
for a poor quality motor club but will turn a good club into a better one
and aim for better than survival in the new millenium.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mechanism of
creating the club's web site from scratch is composed of a few basic steps:</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Decide on the contents.&nbsp;
Create separate pages for each indentifiable topic and provide links to
all of these from the 'home page' or front door to the site.&nbsp; Provide
a link from each page back to the home page.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arrange for an 'Internet
Service Provider' (ISP) to 'host' the site.&nbsp; A small local ISP often
provides a better service than one of the large anonymous multi-national
lnternet Access Providers: seek advice if possible.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload or publish
the site contents to the ISPs web server.&nbsp; You will be told the URL
or web address for your site.&nbsp; An example would be <a href="../../hartmc/index.html">http://www.ukmotorsport.com/hartmc/</a></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Publicise the web
site address as widely as possible.&nbsp; All club paperwork should have
it on, all publicity material, press releases, sponsorship packs etc etc.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reap the benefits!</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
