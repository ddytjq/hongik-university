Away Fans Guide to Stockport County FC has information vital to visiting fans
including where to drink, how to get there, where to park, where to
find food, local cash machines and bookmakers plus lots of other useful
information. The guide also covers the facilities at the ground including
facilities for disabled visitors. The guide is probably the most complete
one of its type on the internet.">

is very open and not the most pleasant of places in a howling gale in the 
middle of winter. The end also plays host to the electronic scoreboard.

</P><P>Away fans also get allocated a number of seats in the covered Vernon Stand. 
</P><P>The away end has no bar or bookmakers although a William Hills can be found in 
Castle Street. The Railway End has only a single food kiosk (although less busy serving windows can 
be found round the back).
Whilst they sell the acclaimed Hollands Pies other food sampled seemed well below average.
</P><P>There is only one toilet block for the whole of the Railway End (that we could find) and expect huge queues at half time for 
both gents and ladies but especially the gents.
</P><P>Flags and banners are normally allowed in but complaints about the noise from local resident means drummers are now
banned from both the home and away sections of the ground.

of the season, but this may have been slightly delayed.

the partly pedestrianised Castle Street in Edgeley, just a 5 minute walk from

has two pool tables and Sky Sports. Home and away fans mix happily in both bars although 
away fans tend to use the games room more. Food is available on match days. It is located half way down Castle

Edgeley Road than the Castle Street pubs it does have the advantage of
having a free car park and is only 10 minutes walk from the ground.

away fans. Families are also welcome (and whilst there is no play area for
the kids at present, this will be forthcoming when the Brewery stump up
the cash).
</P><P>Although it doesn't have a pool table it does have a full size snooker
table, it also has Sky TV and serves food and the beer is very cheap.
</P><P>The Railway gets a special mention by having the net savvy to email
webmaster of visiting teams to invite them. They also request that large
groups of visiting fans (i.e. coach loads) let them know before hand (to
put on extra staff etc). They can be emailed on <a class="entry" href="mailto:sjmaccounting@talk21.com">

</P><P>Leave the M60 at junction 2 onto the A560 signposted Stockport town centre. After about 1/2 mile turn right at the 
traffic lights (signposted Stockport FC) onto B5465 (Edgeley Rd). A mile further on turn right 
down Dale St, Caroline Street or Worral St to reach the ground.   
 
Alternatively exit the M60 at junction 1 onto the A560. At the first set of traffic lights turn right (signposted 
Stockport FC). After about a mile/mile and a half turn left at the lights onto Edgeley Road (signposted Stockport FC)
and the ground is on the right approximately one mile down.
</P><P>Another alternative is to approach from the A6 turn and right into Greek Street, at the roundabout
go straight on to B5465 Mercian Way which soon runs into Edgeley Rd. Turn left 
into Dale St, Caroline Street or Worral St to find the ground.
</P><P>Liam Corte from <a class="entry" href="http://www.hisc-online.co.uk">HISC</a>recommends
</P><P>From North, South & West: Take the M63 and exit at junction 11, then join the A560 and follow signs for Cheadle, 
after 0.25 mile turn right into Edgeley Road, and then after 1 mile turn into Caroline Street for the ground.
</P><P>From East: Take the A6 or A560 into Stockport Town Centre, turn left into Greek Street, take the second exit into 
Mercian Way (via a roundabout) then turn left into Caroline Street, the ground will be straight ahead of you.
</P><P>James Farrar adds the following.
</P><P>Junction 11 is the way to go, much quicker, except it's now Junction 2 of the
M60 after the renumbering of last year.

and street parking is very limited. Locals recommend parking at the cinema 
near the train station and council car parks off Mercian Way for 50p. The is some
street parking to the north of Edgeley Road but it has been advised that it is highly recommended that you 
<b>do not</b> park in Edgeley or Shaw Heath because of the high level of car crime in the area.

little or no interest in the club who can cause trouble around the ground, especially after the game (watch out walking
down Mercian Way after the game). Local rivals Manchester City and not-so-local rivals Burnley may not be as welcome as most.

a visit to each of the local pubs before the game and are often more visible 
outside the Robert Peel. 
</P><P>Stockport's stewards however have been criticized for their heavy
handedness in the past and more than one source has described 
them as 'jobworths'. However at least one contributor complimented them.
