          <b> Standard Variable Mortgage Rate of 5.05% (5.17% APR)#<br>
          </b>Our standard variable mortgage interest rate is currently one of 
          the lowest in the country. Compare our APR# with other lenders' products 
          to see who offers the best long term value. See '<a href="long_term-main.htm" target="body">Long 
          Term Value</a>' to see how we have helped our borrowers save money over 
          the last 5 years.<b><br>
          <br>
          Daily Interest<br>
          </b>Interest is charged daily, which means that you benefit immediately 
          from lower interest charges when making your minimum monthly payment 
          and any overpayments.<b><br>
          <br>
          No Arrangement or Application Fees<br>
          </b>We will not charge you an arrangement or application fee to set 
          up your New Deal Remortgage. You are remortgaging to save money, so 
          the last thing you want to do is to pay a large fee to swap your mortgage 
          to us. You do need to bear in mind that your lender may levy an early 
          repayment charge.<b><br>
          <br>
          No Valuation Fee<br>
          </b>We will carry out a standard valuation of the property and providing 
          your mortgage completes, we will pay for it. We will also give you a 
          copy of the valuation report.<b><br>
          <br>
          No Early Repayment Charge<br>
          </b>We will not charge you for repaying part or all of your mortgage 
          early. As this is a daily interest mortgage, any overpayments you make 
          to reduce your mortgage balance will automatically reduce your interest 
          charges and therefore save you money.<b><br>
          <br>
          No Legal Fees or &pound;300 Cash Bonus<br>
          </b>We will pay the legal fees associated with your remortgage if you 
          use a solicitor on our panel. Any legal costs incurred following the 
          transfer of your mortgage to us will be payable by you. Alternatively, 
          we will give you a cash bonus of &pound;300 on completion of your mortgage, 
          which you can use as you wish!<b><br>
          <br>
          1% Loyalty Cash Bonus <br>
          </b>We want you to keep your mortgage with us and believe you will want 
          to stay once you see our track record for Long Term Value. To reward 
          you for your loyalty, we will pay you a 1% cash bonus at the end of 
          your fifth year with us. The bonus will be based on the capital balance 
          outstanding on your mortgage at that time.<br>
          <br>
          <b>No Compulsory Newbury Building Society Insurance<br>
          </b>We can arrange Buildings and Contents Insurance to protect your 
          home. We recommend that you take Mortgage Payment Protection Insurance 
          (MPPI) to protect your income if you cannot work through redundancy 
          or illness. We also recommend financial advice, which we offer through 
          our partnership with Norwich Union.</font></p>

          'New Deal' remortgage is available from 30 July 2001. A written quotation 
          is available on request.<br>
          <br>
          The maximum loan to value on New Deal Remortgage is 75%. This is calculated 
          using the valuation figure as given by the Society's Valuer.<br>
          <br>
          Registered mortgage intermediaries receive a fee when introducing mortgages 
          to us, which if applicable, will be disclosed to you.<br>
          <br>
          To apply for a mortgage you must be aged 18 or over. All loans are subject 
          to status and independent valuation.<br>
          <br>
          You should ask your tax office if 'New Deal' remortgage benefits are 
          subject to tax.<br>
          <br>
          Your mortgage account must be conducted satisfactorily to continue to 
          benefit from the features of the 'New Deal' remortgage. This includes 
          the 1% loyalty cash bonus on the fifth anniversary of the mortgage completing.<br>
          <br>
          Interest is charged daily.<br>
          <br>
          Overpayments can be made and will immediately affect interest charged. 
          Overpayments cannot be used to take payment holidays or be refunded/drawn 
          down.<br>
          <br>
          As part of the 'New Deal' remortgage we offer a free legal service. 
          *To qualify, the legal work must be carried out by a solicitor on the 
          Society's 'New Deal Remortgage' panel. We will instruct the solicitor 
          when we issue your mortgage offer to you. The free legal service excludes 
          costs incurred from registering unregistered land/property or telegraphic 
          transfer fees - you will be responsible for paying these fees if they 
          apply. If your mortgage does not complete for any reason, you will be 
          responsible for paying the legal fees in full. The free legal service 
          applies only to the initial transfer of the mortgage. Any legal fees 
          incurred after the mortgage is transferred will not be paid by the Society. 
          <br>
          <br>
          We do charge mortgage administration fees for specific mortgage services.

          Fees</a>'.<br>

          The Society frequently discloses black and white data on mortgage customers 
          to a credit reference agency. This procedure has strict rules in order 
          to protect account holders and has been approved by the Data Protection 
          Commissioner.<br>
          <br>
          <b>THE MORTGAGE CODE</b><br>
          <br>
          We comply with the Mortgage Code, which is a voluntary code followed 
          by lenders and mortgage intermediaries, setting minimum standards of 
          good lending practice. A copy of the Mortgage Code is available on request 
          and is given to all customers who apply for a mortgage with us.<br>
          <br>
          We believe that choosing your mortgage is one of the most important 
          decisions you are likely to make, so we will advise you on which product 
          we feel is most suitable for you, taking into account your circumstances, 
          preferences and current market conditions. <br>
          <br>
          We are committed to providing you with standards exceeding those laid 
          out in the Mortgage Code and welcome you to tell us if we are not meeting 
          your expectations.<br>
