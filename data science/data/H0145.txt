        <p>The following rationale for preparing guidelines on ethical issues in medical genetics
        and genetic services appears in a document of the World Health Organization on Ethics and
        Health at the Global Level: WHO's Role and Involvement [1]:</p>
        <p>"A great number of international committees, commissions and advisory groups and
        many reports and guidelines have been produced on specific biomedical issues. In dealing
        with ethics, WHO will not duplicate what has been done or is being done in existing
        national or regional forums. WHO's involvement in ethics will be directly derived from its
        global mission, its inclusive vision of health, and its responsibility for coordinating
        international health action.</p>
        <p>Cutting across specific health issues and disciplines, WHO's main aim must be to
        enhance the integration of ethics in overall public health policies and practices as well
        as in international health cooperation. Perhaps the most pressing reason for this is to
        promote greater equity in access and use of health services by all individuals and in all
        countries. WHO will contribute to coordinating national and regional approaches,
        identifying gaps and workable solutions, and promoting harmonization of standards and
        practices at a global level."</p>
        <p>To this end, the WHO Human Genetics Programme developed the draft document
        "Guidelines on Ethical Issues in Medical Genetics and the Provision of Genetics
        Services"&nbsp;[2]. This document was circulated worldwide, and comments were
        received from all Regions and WHO staff. The draft document and all responses received
        formed the background information for a WHO Meeting on "Ethical Issues in Medical
        Genetics" held in Geneva from 15 to 16 December 1997. The participants at the meeting
        were experts in this field from both developing and developed countries.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the meeting was to review ethical issues in medical genetics and to
        propose international guidelines on ethical issues in medical genetics and genetic
        services. These proposed guidelines, which were unanimously adopted by the participants in
        this meeting, appear below. </p>

        <p>The contents of this document were unanimously agreed upon by the experts present at
        the meeting. The rapid developments in the area of genetics make it necessary to continue
        discussions as new developments take place. For this reason, it is likely that the
        proposed guidelines will need modifications at certain intervals. The group felt that it
        is important for WHO to provide leadership in the international debate on issues related
        to ethics and the provision of medical genetics services.</p>
        <p>The recommendations that follow are designed to assist decision-makers at both national
        and international levels to protect people and families with genetic disabilities, to
        recognize the great potential of advances in human and medical genetics for public health,
        and to develop policies and practices that will ensure that these applications can become
        accessible to all and are provided with due regard to ethics and justice worldwide.</p>
        <p>The advances in human genetics that have occurred during the past twenty years have
        revolutionized knowledge of the role of inheritance in health and disease. We now know
        that our DNA determines not only the cause of catastrophic single-gene disorders, which
        affect millions of persons worldwide, but also predisposition to cancer, heart disease,
        psychiatric disorders and even to some infectious diseases.</p>
        <p>When used properly, this knowledge will be extremely important in helping to achieve
        better health for people in all countries. However, these advances will only be acceptable
        if their application is carried out ethically, with regard to autonomy, justice, education
        and the beliefs and laws of each nation and community.</p>
        <p>Genetics teaches that there is no such thing as a "superior" or
        "inferior" genome; humankind depends for its richness and its survival on the
        interaction of its complex genetic diversity with the environment.</p>
        <p><b>General ethical considerations</b>. The medical application of genetic knowledge
        must be carried out with due regard to the general principles of medical ethics; doing
        good to individuals and families, not doing harm, offering autonomy of choice after
        information is given, and facilitating personal and social justice. These principles,
        which have often been outlined by WHO and other groups, are the same as in other medical
        fields.</p>
        <p><b>The proper use of genetic data</b>. Since we inherit our genes from our parents,
        pass them on to our children, and share them with our close and distant relatives, every
        genetic diagnosis, test and procedure involves many people.</p>
        <p>It is ethically imperative that genetic data should only be used to the advantage of
        members of a family or ethnic group, and never to stigmatize or discriminate against them.</p>
        <p><b>Voluntary use of genetic screening and testing</b>. There shall be no compulsory
        genetic testing of adult individuals or populations.</p>
        <p>Every test shall be offered in such a way that individuals and families are free to
        refuse or accept according to their wishes and moral beliefs.</p>
        <p>All testing should be preceded by adequate information about the purpose and possible
        outcomes of the test and potential choices that may arise.</p>
        <p>Children shall only be tested when it is for the purpose of better medical care, as in
        the case of newborn screening when early treatment will be of benefit to the child.</p>
        <p><b>Prenatal testing</b>. Prenatal diagnosis should be offered to those who need it, but
        there must be no pressure on couples to accept such testing, nor to use the results of the
        test to compel either continuing or terminating a pregnancy when the fetus is affected
        with a genetic disorder.</p>
        <p>Decisions in the context of reproduction should rest with those being tested, not with
        physicians or the government.</p>
        <p>The woman should be an important decision-maker in all matters related to reproduction.</p>
        <p>Prenatal diagnosis should be done only to give parents and physicians information about
        the health of the fetus; its use for paternity testing, except in cases of rape or incest,
        or for gender selection, apart from sex-linked disorders, is not acceptable.</p>
        <p><b>Justice demands equitable access to services</b>. Genetic services for the
        prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease should be available to all, without regard
        to ability to pay, and should be provided first to those whose needs are greatest.</p>
        <p><b>Genetic data should be treated as confidential at all times</b>. Genetic data should
        only be used to advantage and empower an individual or family, and for better treatment or
        prevention of disease. Data relevant to health care should be collected and kept by
        medical geneticists in secure confidential files.</p>
        <p>Genetic data should not be given out to insurance companies, employers, schools or
        governments, other than after the full informed consent of the person tested. In some
        countries it may be possible, or necessary, to protect both confidentiality and
        non-discrimination through legal means.</p>
        <p><b>Genetic counselling</b> is the provision of accurate, full and unbiased information
        in a caring, professional relationship that offers guidance, but allows individuals and
        families to come to their own decisions. Counselling is essential before any genetic
        testing is carried out, and should continue afterwards if the results entail choices for
        the person and family tested.</p>
        <p>Genetic counselling should be available to all, and should be as non-directive as
        possible.</p>
        <p><b>Education</b> about genetics for the public and health care professionals is of
        paramount importance.</p>
        <p>Genetics is playing an increasingly important part in medical practice, and many people
        are concerned about possible abuse of this new knowledge. It is important that education
        about genetic principles relevant to human health be emphasized appropriately for all
        people in all cultures.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;Education is a two-way process, and geneticists and other health care
        professionals have much to learn from support and advocacy groups representing those with
        genetic disorders. Such groups are an integral part of genetic services, and should be
        guaranteed a voice in policy and education.</p>
        <p><b>In conclusion</b>, WHO and its constituents are urged to consider these issues as a
        matter of priority, to facilitate global consultation and consensus on them, and to ensure
        that ethical codes are put in place nationally and internationally so as to guarantee that
        advances in genetics can benefit the community in an ethical way. It was agreed that WHO
        and many other international bodies are correct in rejecting any intentional step towards
        human cloning as unsafe, ethically unacceptable and a distraction from the more crucial
        issues dealt with in these guidelines.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font SIZE="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
        <p>The proposed guidelines are intended to protect people and families with genetic
        conditions and to inform health policy officials at the highest level of government,
        public health officials and workers, and physicians and other health care professionals.</p>
        <p>The document should also be seen as a contribution to WHO's consideration of
        "Health Policy for the 21st Century," especially since it concerns global issues
        of equity in access to medical genetics services by all individuals and in all countries.
        One of WHO's main aims must be to further the integration of ethics in overall health
        policies and practices as well as in international health cooperation. </p>
        <p>The primary purpose of these proposed guidelines is to assist policy-makers, officials,
        practitioners and other health workers in the Member States of WHO in ensuring that
        genetic information and genetic services are introduced into the broader medical practice
        of the nations in ethically acceptable ways. A secondary purpose is to allay fears and to
        reassure the public that adequate controls exist in member countries to prevent abuses of
        genetic information and unacceptable practices. Member States will develop their own
        policies and practices, using the broader principles and guidelines of this document as
        points of departure.</p>
        <p>The knowledge gained from discoveries in human genetics has the potential for making a
        significant improvement in the health of the world's people when applied properly at the
        individual, family and community levels. If such discoveries and information are
        integrated into primary health care in ethically acceptable ways and with respect for
        cultural and religious diversity, the increased benefits for diagnosis, treatment and
        prevention of human genetic conditions will be appreciable in both developed and
        developing countries. </p>
        <p>Genetics and biomedical technology open vast new avenues for research and can provide
        humankind with much needed therapeutic tools. But, where human life and dignity are at
        stake, technology cannot be left on its own to govern ethics, nor can health technology,
        practices and procedures be left to the vagaries of economic forces and personal
        interests, fears or vulnerabilities. The profound economic and technological inequalities
        that exist between nations and population groups have an impact on biomedical research and
        health care practice. Efforts must be made worldwide to mitigate such inequalities, so
        that the safety and rights of all individuals and communities are adequately protected and
        a proper balance is achieved between their rights and responsibilities. </p>
        <p>In pursuing this task, it was recognized that some ethical problems of human genetics
        are highly debatable and -- at this time in history -- are issues beyond the reach of
        practical consensus among countries. The meeting was convened to explore the possibility
        of reaching moral consensus on such issues, but it could not produce consensus where this
        does not exist in the international community. We recognize that the laws of nations
        differ with respect to these particular issues, and that laws are subject to debate,
        evolution and change. </p>
        <p>In the face of such controversial issues, our view is not that WHO is obliged to
        resolve these controversies, but that WHO can call for international unity among leaders
        and peoples as regards the task of including genetic knowledge and its discoveries within
        the goals of medicine. We recognize and respect the diversities of culture, religion and
        social structure that shape the public's moral attitudes in different countries. We also
        call for mutual respect and continued dialogue on such issues among scientifically
        informed members of the world's cultural and religious traditions, and for an exchange of
        views between developed and developing countries.</p>
        <p>Educating the public should be a primary goal of WHO, and education is a prerequisite
        to informed discussion of the issues in this document. WHO should play a leading role in
        providing a platform for public discussion of ethics and genetics worldwide. </p>
        <p><b><font SIZE="+1">2. ETHICAL PRINCIPLES IN MEDICINE </font></b></p>
        <p>The traditional sources of ethical guidelines in medicine apply also to medical
        genetics, which is a field of medicine (Table 1). Medical genetics' main concerns,
        however, extend beyond those of the traditional structure of medicine and the
        physician-patient relationship. For example: (a) genetic information may affect an entire
        family, rather than only the individual; (b) genetic discoveries may be predictive of
        future adverse events in an individual's or family member's health; (c) genetic
        information and the choices of the present may affect future generations; and (d) medical
        genetics has a tradition of non-directiveness in counselling.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The principle of respect for autonomy includes: (a) respecting the self-determination
        and choices of autonomous persons, and (b) protecting persons with diminished autonomy,
        e.g., children and persons with mental impairments.</p>
        <p>The principle of beneficence (L. "bene" = good) is the source of physicians'
        obligation to give highest loyalty to the welfare of individuals and families. Beneficence
        also bears upon a goal of medicine to improve the health of populations with the voluntary
        cooperation of the populations involved.</p>
        <p>Non-maleficence (L. "male" = evil, harm) is the source of the traditional
        medical norm of "do no harm", meaning a duty to prevent harm altogether, or, if
        harm cannot be avoided, to minimize harm to individuals and families. </p>
        <p>The goals of justice can be described somewhat differently: treating persons fairly,
        giving persons what they deserve, or giving persons that to which they are entitled. The
        term "distributive" (or social) justice means to allocate benefits (e.g.,
        property) and burdens (e.g.,&nbsp;taxation) fairly and with equity, in order to enhance
        social harmony and cooperation. Distributing the benefits (e.g.,&nbsp;of diagnosis and
        treatment) and the burdens (e.g., of rationing of expensive care or of research risks) of
        health care ought to be governed by ethically justified rules such as: to each according
        to need, to each according to an equal share or opportunity, etc.</p>
        <p>At present, the principles laid out in Table 1 are not applied with equal force around
        the world, especially respect for persons. Health professionals need to pay special
        attention to these principles in areas of the world where they are unfamiliar or
        infrequently used.</p>
        <p>It is a common misconception that prevention and care of genetic disorders and birth
        defects concern only people living in industrialized countries. Genetic conditions occur
        with similar frequencies in different nations and irrespective of the socioeconomic status
        of individuals. In fact, at all levels of society, children born with genetic
        disadvantages have higher risks of getting sick and dying of environmental causes such as
        infections and malnutrition. A&nbsp;meaningful right to health care must include access to
        services for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of genetic disorders. The priority
        assigned to genetic services with respect to other health services is a matter of public
        health policy in each country. </p>
        <p>WHO Member States should be encouraged to draw up public health policies that include
        standards for genetic services along the lines recommended in the Report of a WHO
        Scientific Group on Control of Hereditary Diseases [3]. People have the right to equitable
        access to genetic services according to the standard of care that exists in each country,
        according to need and irrespective of the ability to pay. Also, some parties, such as
        women, children and people with disabilities, are especially disadvantaged and vulnerable
        in some societies and deserve special consideration. Professionals should help to protect
        such persons wherever they are at risk of harm.</p>
        <p>Within genetic services, priority should be given to programmes that address the
        heaviest burdens and needs of the majority of the population. In particular, efforts
        should be directed towards extending the reach of genetic services at the primary care
        level, with the utilization of technologies and personnel that are appropriate to the
        needs, expectations and beliefs of the community. On the other hand, it is an inequitable
        use of scarce resources to develop expensive high technology services that cater only to
        the wealthier sectors of society while being largely inaccessible to the majority. </p>
        <p>The principle of distributive justice should ensure that scarce resources are utilized
        equitably on the basis of need, and thus would oppose catering to consumers' requests for
        genetic services (e.g.,&nbsp;prenatal diagnosis) to gratify cultural or personal desires
        rather than for medical reasons. </p>
        <p><b><font SIZE="+1">3. GOALS AND PRACTICES OF MEDICAL GENETICS</font></b></p>
        <p>Medical genetics is the field of medicine that is most centrally involved in providing
        services to persons with genetic conditions and their families. The goals of medical
        genetics services are to help people with a genetic disadvantage and their families to
        live and reproduce as normally as possible, to make informed choices in reproductive and
        health matters, to assist people to obtain access to relevant medical services
        (diagnostic, therapeutic, rehabilitative or preventive) or social support systems, to help
        them adapt to their unique situation, and to become informed on relevant new developments.
        </p>
        <p>Conditions studied by medical geneticists include diseases caused by defects in single
        genes (e.g., haemophilia, sickle cell anaemia, neurofibromatosis, cystic fibrosis),
        disorders caused by interaction between several genes and environmental factors (e.g.,
        common congenital malformations, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, breast
        cancer, mental disorders), and conditions caused by chromosomal anomalies (e.g., Down
        syndrome). Diagnostic work in medical genetics includes laboratory work at the DNA,
        protein and chromosome levels as well as clinical observation of disorders, including
        birth defects. </p>
        <p>Whereas single-gene disorders are rare, conditions caused by an interaction between
        genes and environmental factors are frequent and include disorders such as cardiovascular
        diseases, several cancers, asthma, diabetes mellitus and mental disorders. Preventive
        aspects of work in medical genetics include identification of high-risk individuals with
        respect to common disorders for the purpose of preventing disease (e.g., heart disease) or
        securing early diagnosis and treatment (several cancers). At present there are significant
        research efforts aimed at developing somatic cell gene therapies or therapies to improve
        or block the function of genes.</p>
        <p>Medical genetics services should be organized at all levels of medical care and should
        be directed by specially trained physicians. Actions may be conducted by a variety of
        health personnel according to the level of care and the particular organization of health
        delivery in each society. The different members of the genetics team may include Ph.D
        geneticists, nurses, primary care physicians, other health professionals, specially
        trained health care workers or genetic counsellors, social workers and laboratory
        personnel. </p>

        <p>&nbsp;Non-discriminatory language emphasizes the personhood of those with genetic
        conditions. Thus, for example, someone with Down syndrome is best described as a
        "person (or child) with Down syndrome" rather than a "Down syndrome
        child" or "Down syndrome case." Words that dehumanize persons with
        disabilities or stigmatize them should be avoided.</p>
        <p><b><font SIZE="+1">5. GENETIC COUNSELLING</font></b></p>
        <p>Non-directive counselling has two major elements. The first is the provision of
        accurate, full and unbiased information that individuals and families may use in making
        decisions. The second is an understanding, empathic relationship that offers guidance and
        helps people to work towards their own decisions. In non-directive counselling, the
        professional avoids purposely slanting information that may lead people to do what the
        counsellor thinks best. Individuals and families must depend on the counsellor as a source
        of accurate information, and usually have no way of discovering when information is
        biased. Non-directive counselling does not mean presenting information and then abandoning
        individuals and families to make their own decisions without help. Most people may want to
        talk with someone who will listen to their concerns, help them to express and understand
        their own values, and help them to work toward their own decisions. Non-directive
        counsellors do not tell people what to do; decisions are those of the individuals and the
        families. The counsellor should, as much as possible, support all decisions. </p>
        <p>One factor in favour of non-directive counselling was that genetics evolved as a
        largely diagnostic speciality with little treatment. As more treatments become available,
        and as susceptibility testing for common multifactorial diseases may suggest lifestyle
        changes that could benefit the individual's health, the counselling approach may become
        similar to approaches in general medicine, where the doctor may recommend beneficial
        treatment or lifestyle changes. Counselling related to reproductive choices should remain
        non-directive. The ethical principles that underlie genetic counselling and their
        applications are outlined in Table&nbsp;3.</p>

        <p><b><font SIZE="+1">6. GENETIC SCREENING AND TESTING </font></b></p>
        <p>Genetic screening refers to tests offered to a population group to identify
        asymptomatic people at an increased risk from a particular adverse outcome. Examples are
        phenylalanine screening for phenylketonuria in newborn babies, or the use of maternal
        serum biochemical markers in pregnant women to screen for fetuses with Down syndrome. In
        all cases, individuals whose screens indicate that they are at higher risk must be offered
        a definitive diagnostic test.</p>
        <p>Genetic testing is the analysis of the status of a particular gene. A genetic test may
        establish: (a) a specific diagnosis of a genetic condition in a symptomatic individual,
        (b) the certainty that a particular condition will develop in an individual who is
        asymptomatic at the time of the testing (presymptomatic diagnosis), or (c) the presence of
        a genetic predisposition to develop a particular complex disease such as cancer or
        cardiovascular disease.</p>
        <p>The main objective of genetic screening and testing is to prevent disease or secure
        early diagnosis and treatment. </p>
        <p>Ordinarily, population screening programmes are offered only when proven methods of
        treatment or prevention are available. In selecting population groups to be screened
        because they are thought to have higher than average risks, it is important to avoid the
        possibility of stigmatizing the entire group. Anonymous screening for epidemiological
        purposes may be conducted after notification of the population to be screened, in the
        absence of preventive or therapeutic options for the individuals screened. Screening
        programmes are usually better received if they work in cooperation with community leaders
        in the group to be screened. Screening should be preceded by educational programmes for
        the group.</p>
        <p>If screening is provided for newborn babies, there is an obligation on health care
        providers to make sure that appropriate and timely treatment is provided. Suggested

        <p>The ethical requirement of informed consent differs between a research setting and a
        clinical situation. International ethical guidelines for research [4] are applicable to
        efforts to establish new genetic tests or to develop quality control of tests [5], as well
        as to other research-related situations. Informed consent for any study to validate a
        genetic test must be obtained if the specimen can be linked to the person from whom it was
        taken. People should be informed of possible future uses of the specimen, whether
        identifiers will be retained, and if so, whether individuals will be re-contacted about
        new developments concerning their health care. </p>
        <p>If a child or adolescent is tested as part of a research project, the child's assent
        should be sought. An adequate explanation for a child's assent should describe the
        potential harms and benefits of testing in a simple manner appropriate to the child's age.</p>

        <p>Presymptomatic testing refers to identification of healthy individuals who may have
        inherited a gene for a late-onset disease, and if so will develop the disorder if they
        live long enough (e.g., Huntington disease). Susceptibility testing identifies healthy
        individuals who may have inherited a genetic predisposition that puts them at increased
        risk of developing a multifactorial disease, such as heart disease, Alzheimer disease or
        cancer, but who, even so, may never develop the disease in question.</p>
        <p>Presymptomatic testing in the absence of therapeutic options should be available if the
        following conditions are met:<ul>
          <ul>
            <ul>
              <ul>
                <p>&nbsp;A. The information provided by testing will be used to prevent harm to the person
                tested, or to spouse, family, prospective children or others.</p>

            <ul>
              <ul>
                <p>B. The person is fully informed about the limitations of testing, including
                possibilities of uninformative results, and inability to predict exact age of onset or
                (sometimes) severity of symptoms.</p>
                <p>C. The person (or the legally authorized representative) is mentally capable of giving
                consent.</p>
                <p>D. Testing is accompanied by a counselling programme of appropriate length and
                intensity for the disorder.</p>

            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>In regard to requests for testing children, in the absence of medical benefit through
        prevention or treatment, presymptomatic or susceptibility tests for adult-onset disorders
        are usually best postponed until adulthood, when the young adult can make her/his own
        decision. In counselling, geneticists need to explain to parents the potential benefits
        and potential harms of testing children. </p>

        <p>Disclosure and confidentiality issues are some of the most frequent ethical problems
        appearing in medical genetics. Because of the possibility of harm from disclosure to
        institutional third parties, utmost care must be taken to protect confidentiality.
        However, a genetic diagnosis in an individual may indicate genetic risks in his/her
        relatives. In those circumstances, the genetic service provider should encourage the
        individual to ask the relatives to seek genetic counselling. If the individual refuses,
        especially in cases where effective and affordable treatment or preventive measures are
        available, the counsellor may ethically make direct contact with the relatives, bearing in
        mind that the information provided should concern only their own genetic risks, not the
        genetic status nor the identity of the relative who refused to inform them. Counsellors
        should also make sure that adequate follow-up takes place.</p>

        <p>10. <b>PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS</b></p>
        <p>Prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders and fetal anomalies has expanded significantly
        for hundreds of conditions through DNA analysis of fetal cells, and the increased use of
        ultrasound and maternal serum biochemical screening (amniocentesis). The purpose of
        prenatal diagnosis is to rule out the presence in the fetus of a particular medical
        condition for which the pregnancy is at an increased risk. This information is provided to
        the couple to assist in their decision-making process regarding the available options,
        such as carrying the pregnancy to term, preparing for a difficult delivery and for special
        newborn care, or terminating the pregnancy. Genetic counselling is particularly important
        prior to prenatal diagnosis and, after a result indicating an affected fetus, to secure
        fully informed choices. Information about the purposes, benefits and limitations of
        maternal serum biochemical screening must be given when offering the test, including the
        fact that any abnormal screening result will need confirmatory testing by invasive
        prenatal diagnosis and may potentially lead to a decision about abortion.(1)</p>
        <p>Cultures, religions and national laws differ with regard to abortion of an affected
        fetus after prenatal diagnosis. WHO cannot resolve these differences, but can suggest
        general guidelines for the provision of prenatal diagnosis, subject to the framework of
        the law in each individual country. Proposed ethical guidelines for the provision of
        prenatal diagnosis and of counselling about it are given in Tables&nbsp;8 and 9.</p>

        individuals and couples following a prenatal diagnosis assumes that any such abortion is
        not prohibited by law. In this respect, WHO refers to the Official United Nations Report
        of the International Conference on Population and Development (Cairo, 5-13 September 1994)
        which states, in part, (para 8.25): "In no case should abortion be promoted as a
        method of family planning. ... Women who have unwanted pregnancies should have ready
        access to reliable information and compassionate counselling. Any measures or changes
        related to abortion within the health system can only be determined at the national or
        local level according to the national legislative process."</i></font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;11. <b>BANKED DNA </b></p>
        <p>Stored DNA in tissue or blood samples may provide useful information for examination of
        genetic disorders in families or for research. Information from DNA specimens may be of
        importance for relatives and not only for the person from whom DNA originates. Therefore,
        access to stored DNA by family members needs to be considered.</p>
        <p>Existing stored specimens or samples, such as those in university or hospital
        departments or collections of blood spots, should not be subject to new rules for consent
        or re-contact that may be established in the future.</p>
        <p>In developing policies about samples to be collected in the future, it is helpful to
        keep the following issues in mind:<ul>
          <ul>
            <p>- protection of individuals from possible discrimination by employers and insurers,
            etc.;</p>
            <p>- possible benefits to the individuals from research findings;</p>
            <p>- the possibility of multiple uses of the same sample in different and unforeseen
            research projects;</p>
            <p>- possible sharing of samples among collaborators, including international
            collaborators and commercial entities;</p>
            <p>- advantages and disadvantages for individuals and researchers of removing all
            identifiers (including coded numbers) from a sample.</p>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>A blanket informed consent that would allow use of a sample for genetic research in
        general, including future as yet unspecified projects, appears to be the most efficient
        and economical approach, avoiding costly re-contact before each new research project. The
        consent should specify that family members may request access to a sample to learn their
        own genetic status but not that of the donor. While spouses may not have such a right of
        access, their concerns should be considered. All samples should be used with appropriate
        regard for confidentiality. Proposed guidelines for access to banked DNA are given in
        Table 10. </p>

        <p>Biomedical research in human genetics can lead to the development of diagnostic and
        pharmaceutical products. Patents may be necessary to raise funding to develop such
        products commercially, but gene sequences without proven utility should not be granted
        patents. Patenting has the potential to impede international collaboration, especially
        between developing and developed countries, to the ultimate detriment of service delivery
        to those with genetic disorders. Genetics differs from many areas of research in that
        important new knowledge can come from a family, or an ethnic group, with a particular
        genetic variant. If this leads to the development of a diagnostic test or new therapies,
        equity requires that the donors, or the community generally, should receive some benefit.</p>

        <p><b><font SIZE="+1">12. ASSISTED REPRODUCTION AND MEDICAL GENETICS</font></b></p>
        <p>Although not directly related to medical genetics, various types of assisted
        reproduction are often discussed in connection with genetic counselling. Couples who are
        at risk of having a child with a genetic disorder may choose alternative options. These
        may include egg or sperm or embryo donation, or surrogacy. Countries have legitimate wide
        differences in their beliefs about the acceptability of each of these practices. In
        addition, these alternatives are often expensive in health resources. Whichever
        reproductive alternatives are offered must be consistent not only with the cultural
        traditions and beliefs of each country, but also with overall respect for the autonomy of
        individuals and families. In this context, reproductive cloning (the creation of a fetus
        whose genome is entirely derived from another individual) has been rejected by many
        international bodies, including WHO, has aroused fears in many societies, and is not in
        accord with currently accepted international ethical standards.</p>
