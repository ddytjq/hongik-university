The big picture:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The <B>somatosensory system</B> includes multipletypes of sensation from the body - light touch, pain, pressure,temperature, and joint and muscle position sense (also calledproprioception).  However, these modalities are lumped into threedifferent pathways in the spinal cord and have different targetsin the brain.  The first modality is called <B>discriminativetouch</B>, which includes touch, pressure, and vibration perception,and enables us to &quot;read&quot; raised letters with our fingertips,or describe the shape and texture of an object without seeingit.  The second grouping is <B>pain and temperature</B>, whichis just what it sounds like, and also includes the sensationsof itch and tickle.  The third modality is called <B>proprioception</B>,and includes receptors for what happens below the body surface:muscle stretch, joint position, tendon tension, etc.  This modalityprimarily targets the <B>cerebellum</B>, which needs minute-by-minutefeedback on what the muscles are doing. <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">These modalities differ in their receptors, pathways,and targets, and also in the level of crossing.  Any sensory systemgoing to the cerebral cortex will have to cross over at some point,because the cerebral cortex operates on a contralateral (oppositeside) basis.  The <U>discriminative touch system crosses high</U>- in the medulla.  The <U>pain system crosses low</U> - in thespinal cord.  The proprioceptive system is going to the cerebellum,which (surprise!) works ipsilaterally (same side).  Thereforethis system <U>doesn't cross</U>.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>B.  Discriminative touch:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">As an introduction to the somatosensory system, wewill start by looking in some detail at the discriminative touchsystem.  The system that is carried in the spinal cord includesthe entire body from the neck down; face information is carriedby cranial nerves, and we will come back to it later.  Overall,the pathway looks like this:<BR></FONT><CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD WIDTH=252><BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="bsen1.gif"></CENTER></TD><TD WIDTH=252><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Sensation enters the periphery via sensory axons.  All sensory neurons have their cell bodies sitting outside the spinal cord in a clump called a <B>dorsal root ganglion</B>.  There is one such ganglion for every spinal nerve.  The sensory neurons are unique because unlike most neurons, the signal does not pass through the cell body.  Instead the cell body sits off to one side, without dendrites, and the signal passes directly from the distal axon process to the proximal process.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The proximal end of the axon enters the dorsal half of the spinal cord, and immediately turns up the cord towards the brain.  These axons are called the <B>primary afferents </B>(pink), because they are the same axons that brought the signal into the cord.  (In general, <I>afferent</I> means towards the brain, and <I>efferent</I> means away from it.)  The axons ascend in the dorsal white matter of the spinal cord.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">At the medulla, the primary afferents finally synapse.  The neurons receiving the synapse are now called the <B>secondary afferents </B>(purple).  The secondary afferents cross immediately, and form a new tract on the other side of the brainstem. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2 WIDTH=504><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">This tract of secondary afferents will ascend all the way to the <B>thalamus</B>, which is the clearinghouse for eveything that wants to get into cortex.  Once in thalamus, they will synapse, and a third and final neuron (lavender) will go to <B>cerebral cortex</B>, the final target.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>C.  Names and faces:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Now let's give names and images to the pathways andnuclei.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The location of the pathway in the spinal cord hasseveral names.  Since the tracts are on the dorsal side of thecord, they are sometimes called the <B>dorsal columns</B>.  Inupright humans, we call dorsal &quot;posterior&quot;, so theyare also called the <B>posterior columns</B>.  Finally, they haveLatin names.  If we look at a cervical cord section (below) theposterior columns can actually be divided into two separate tracts. The midline tracts are tall and thin, and were given the name<B>gracile fasciculus</B> (gracile means slender, and fasciculusmeans a collection of axons).  The outer tracts are more wedgeshaped, and were given the name <B>cuneate fasciculus</B> (cuneatemeans wedge-shaped).  <BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bsen2.gif"></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The gracile fasciculus is carrying all of the informationfrom the lower half of the body (legs and trunk), while the cuneatefasciculus is carrying information from the upper half (arms andtrunk).  This explains why you will only see the cuneate fasciculusin thoracic and cervical sections, even though the gracile fasciculusstarts down in the sacral cord.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">In the medulla, each tract synapses in a nucleusof the same name.  The gracile fasciculus axons synapse in the<B>gracile nucleus</B>, and the cuneate axons synapse in the <B>cuneatenucleus</B>.</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bsen3.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The secondary afferents leave these nuclei and immediatelycross, lining up in the ventral medulla.  The new tract that theyform is called the <B>medial lemniscus</B> (&quot;midline ribbon&quot;),and it will ascend all the way through the brainstem.  Here ishow it looks in the upper medulla:<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bsen4.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">In the pons, the medial lemniscus begins to flattenout as the pontine nuclei enlarge beneath it.</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bsen5.gif"><BR><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">By the time we get to the midbrain, the medial lemniscusis getting pushed way up laterally and dorsally, which will positionit to enter the thalamus.<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bsen6.gif"><BR><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Once in the thalamus, the secondary afferents synapsein a thalamic nucleus called the <B>ventrolateral posterior nucleus</B>(VPL).  The <B>thalamocortical afferents</B> (from thalamus tocortex) travel up through the internal capsule to get to <B>primarysomatosensory cortex</B>, the end of the pathway.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Primary somatosensory cortex is located in the post-centralgyrus, which is the fold of cortex just posterior to the centralsulcus.<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bsen7.gif"><BR><BR><BR></CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>D.
