<H2>ANNUAL REPORT </H2>
</center>
Activity in the Network continued at its full level throughout the
year resulting in 53~joint publications for refereed journals, and 24
conference reports. As for the first year, the scientific report below
is split according to the major research areas detailed in our original
proposal. An additional major activity during 1997-98 is, however,
listed separately since it does not neatly fall under any single
heading. This is the Network's activities in preparation for, and
to exploit the Hubble Deep Field South programme, a Director's
observing programme on the Hubble Space Telescope. 
<br><br>
The Network's first set of postdoctoral fellows reached the end
of their 2-year terms in September 1998. Earlier in the year
the Network therefore carried out a joint hiring exercise based on a common
internationally circulated advertisement and joint consideration of
the 40 or so applications which arrived in response to it. This
exercise resulted in one of the Network Fellows being retained for
a further two years and the other five being replaced. All five
who moved on were successful in obtaining permanent or long-term 
research posts in astrophysics, four in their home country and the
fifth in Mexico.
<br><br>
The annual meeting of the Network was held over the period 31 August -
5 September at Castle Poelgeest in Leiden. This was a very lively and 
interactive meeting attended by 71 scientists from the six Network
sites. It led to substantial progress on existing joint programmes as 
well as to a number of new collaborations. A number of smaller
meetings were held at various sites during the year and are detailed 
in the scientific report below.
<p>
<B> 1 Radio galaxies </B>
<br><br>
Many of the most interesting targets uncovered by radio surveys are
optically faint, and as a result ESO's VLT (available from April 1999), with
its huge collecting area and diverse battery of instrumentation offers a
great opportunity for European astronomers. In consequence, in addition to
continuing their fruitful multi--wavelength imaging and spectroscopic
campaigns, Network radioastronomers have this year concentrated on 
preparing samples of radio
galaxies for VLT studies. The Leiden-Cambridge collaboration has
obtained and reduced completely data for
half of the 92~cm ``Westerbork survey In the Southern Hemisphere'' (WISH),
the first deep large-area radio survey at low frequencies in the southern
hemisphere.  In addition, spectroscopic redshifts have been obtained for
the first large and complete sample of powerful southern radio
galaxies.
<br><br>
<UL>
<LI> Scientific highlights
<br><br>
Network astronomers obtained the first solid
detection of CO emission from 
a distant radio galaxy, 1909+722. 
<br><br>
Sub-millimetre studies established that the most distant 
radio galaxies contain more dust than their low redshift counterparts.
<br><br>
Deep HST infrared imaging showed that, unlike their
low redshift counterparts, the highest redshift radio galaxies 
are not associated with well formed ellipticals.
<br><br>
Deep spectroscopy of powerful redshift one radio galaxies
demonstrated that the interstellar medium is dramatically affected by the
passage of the radio source shocks.
</UL><p>
<B> 2a Evolution of cluster galaxies: </B>
<br><br>
A key objective is to understand how
galaxies evolve in rich cluster environments.  We have investigated the
luminosity evolution of cluster galaxies,
concentrating in particular on the spheroidal galaxies, using a
newly-constructed catalog of morphologically-classified Hubble Space
Telescope images of 13 clusters with redshifts $0.17<z<0.56$.  We find
convincing evidence of evolutionary brightening of the cluster
ellipticals as expected for
passive evolution of stellar populations.  Using spectro-photometry
we have also studied the
star formation histories of galaxies in these clusters.
<br><br>
A deep, multi-colour imaging survey of a sample of high X-ray
luminosity clusters (z=0.22-0.28) shows that the integrated luminosity
of the redder cluster galaxies is well correlated with cluster
X-ray temperature, and hence with cluster mass.  Furthermore, the
typical restframe UV-optical colours of the luminous ellipticals
exhibit a remarkably small cluster-to-cluster scatter, indicating that
this population varies little between clusters.
However, at fainter magnitudes we observe a marked increase in the
range of mid-UV colours. In the light of the apparent decline in the
population of S0 galaxies seen in distant, $z>0.4$, clusters  we
propose that they may be the progenitors of the dominant S0 population
of local rich clusters, caught in the final stage before they become
completely quiescent.
<br><br>
The colour-magnitude relation for early-type galaxies has been used to
constrain the formation of rich cluster galaxies up to redshifts
$\simeq1$. The bulk of the stellar populations of these galaxies has
been found to be old, formed at redshifts greater than 2.  We have
also developed a new Bayesian classifier for photometric redshifts, and
studied its application to the identification of new high redshift
clusters.
<p>
<B> 2b Evolution of field galaxies: </B>
<br><br>
The study of distant star-forming galaxies has witnessed remarkable
recent progress. Several network researchers have very
successfully used the new observing capabilities provided by the
SCUBA bolometer array at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT),
which has improved the performance of submillimetre-wave continuum
observations substantially.  Observations of dust-enshrouded star
formation in extremely distant galaxies 
has opened a new window on galaxy formation and evolution.
The faint objects detected have been used to estimate a major
contribution to the global star formation history of
the Universe.  Their HST morphologies
indicate that interacting and disturbed galaxies predominate, suggesting
that interactions remain
important for triggering star formation bursts at high redshift.
Faint, compact
galaxies may represent a later evolutionary stage in these mergers, or
be more centrally-concentrated starbursts. The Network team has obtained the
deepest sub-mm galaxy number counts published so far.
<br><br>
The evolution of field ellipticals has been studied
using data from the Hubble Deep Field. 
Even at redshifts as high as 2-3, these galaxies lie on the fundamental
plane, apparently in a Virial equilibrium.  However, at these same
redshifts a significant lack of large galaxies is observed, indicating
that the formation of an important fraction of present-day ellipticals
was not complete at these early epochs.
<br><br>
Several Network researchers in our network have been studying the
host galaxies of QSOs, reporting the first unambiguous detection of the
host galaxy of a normal radio-quiet high-redshift QSO at 2.2 microns
(K-band).  The luminosity of the host is about 35\% of the total
in the observed K-band, implying that the host is about 100 times 
brighter than an unevolved L* galaxy placed at the QSO redshift (z=2),
and about 25 times
brighter than a passively evolved L* galaxy at the same redshift. The
luminosity of the host galaxy is thus similar to the highest found
in radio-loud QSOs and radio-galaxies at the same redshift.
<br><br>
At lower redshifts, we have made substantial progress towards
understanding why Lyman-alpha emission is very weak or absent in the UV
spectrum of HII galaxies.  We have observed 8 HII galaxies with low
metallicity with HST and detected Lyman alpha with a strong P-Cygni
profile in half of them, while broad Lyman alpha absorption with no
emission was detected in the other half.  This result supports
the hypothesis that Lyman alpha is destroyed in these systems by
multiple scattering in gas at the same velocity as the emitting gas,
and that Lyman alpha photons can only escape in the line wings. The
difference between detecting or not the Lyman alpha emission may be
related to the presence, or not, of the high velocity scatterers, i.e., a
galactic wind.
<br><br>
Network researchers from Paris and Cambridge have detected molecular
gas in a third QSO at redshift larger than 4, the lensed
radio quiet quasar BRI~0952-0115 at redshift of $z=4.43$.
further papers are in preparation concerning their latest
results on the mm/submm detection of dust emission in high redshift 
QSOs using the IRAM 30m, SCUBA/JCMT and Caltech/CSO.
In order to select new sources to search for molecular lines in absorption 
at high redshift, the group has also performed a millimeter continuum
survey of a large number of radiosources. They have detected 1.3mm 
emission in several hundred sources. 
<p>
<B> 3 QSO absorption lines </B>
<br><br>
A group including a number of Network researchers has used the 
adaptive optics system on the Canada-France-Hawaii 
telescope to study intermediate and high redshift quasar-hosts. 
In particular, they observed the $z$~=~3.87
broad absorption line quasar APM~08279+5255 (Ledoux et al. 1998).
The object is found to be a double source. The separation of the two images is
0.35~$\pm$~0.02 arcsecs and the intensity ratio $I_{\rm north}$/$I_{\rm
south}$ = 1.21~$\pm$~0.25 in the $H$-band. No other image is detected down to
$H$(5$\sigma$)~=~21.3 within 10$''$ from the double image.
Strong support for the lensing hypothesis comes from the uniformity of the 
quasar spectrum as a function of spatial position in the image obtained 
with the integral field spectrograph OASIS at CFHT. From the
2D-spectroscopy, narrow-band images are reconstructed
over the wavelength range 5600-6200~\AA\ to search for
emission-line objects in a field of 15$''\times$12$''$ around the
quasar. We find no  such object to  a limit of 6$\times$10$^{-17}$ erg
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. We use the images centered on the deepest
absorption lines of the to dim the quasar and to increase
the sensitivity closer to the line of sight. One of the images, centered at
5766.4~\AA , exhibits a 3$\sigma$ excess 1.5$''$ from the quasar to the
north-east. \par\noindent
Further Network collaboration has been developed as part of HdFS
project (see below).
This is a unique opportunity to study the relation between the 
Ly$\alpha$ forest and metal absorption systems detected in the QSO spectrum
and the galaxies in the field at $z$~$\sim$~1.2. A VLT proposal has been 
submitted.
<p>
<B> 4 Population synthesis models </B>
<br><br>
Charlot (Paris) and Kauffmann (Munich)
have shown that a powerful way to constrain galaxy formation
theories is to analyze the evolution of the $K$-band luminosity function,
since this avoids uncertainties in relating galaxy colours to morphology.
Based on presently available samples, the evolution of the $K$-band
luminosity function appears to be inconsistent with traditional models,
but similar to that expected in hierarchical models of galaxy formation.
<br><br>
A major effort in Padova concentrated on interfacing the new Padova 
multi-component
population synthesis code with the Durham semi-analytic galaxy
formation model. Very encouraging results from this effort were
presented at the 1998  annual meeting and are the subject of two
papers under preparation. An INTERNET interactive section providing
the new models is under construction. The Padova stellar populations
group is also collaborating with Cambridge (star formation indicators in
galaxies), Paris (photometric redshifts and narrow band indices
in early--type galaxies), and Munich (stellar evolution and
population synthesis).
<p>
<B> 5 Semianalytic modelling </B>
<br><br>
Kauffmann (Munich) and Charlot (Paris) 
have combined semi-analytic models of galaxy formation in a
hierarchical universe with new metallicity-dependent spectral
synthesis models to compute the chemical enrichment, colors, line
indices and mass-to-light ratios of early-type galaxies as a function
of redshift. The success of their models in reproducing the slope and
scatter of the color-magnitude and Mg$_2-\sigma$ relations of 
elliptical galaxies challenges the traditional view in which
early-type galaxies form in a single monolithic collapse at high 
redshift and undergo closed-box chemical evolution. They further 
predict that the metallicity of the intracluster medium must
evolve very little out to $z>1$.
<br><br>
Paris and Durham researchers are collaborating to implement the 
theoretical IR/submm spectra of Devriendt et al. 
(1998) into the semi-analytic model of Baugh et al. (1997), to obtain
specific predictions for IR galaxy counts. Paris and Padova scientists
are working to produce multi-wavelengths models of Active Galactic 
Nuclei in a simple semi-analytic scheme. They will
implement simple recipes for the formation and evolution of 
starbursts in the simple semi-analytic scheme of Cavaliere \& 
Vittorini (1998), which takes into account QSO formation and rejuvenation
through interactions. This model will give multi-wavelength predictions
for galaxies and AGNs, in particular, for AGN counts
at IR/submm wavelengths.
<br><br>
The Durham-Copenhagen group have used their semi-analytic galaxy 
formation model to calculate the size distribution of galaxy
disks and how this evolves with redshift. They find that in a
Lambda CDM model, the predicted present-day distribution of disk
scalelengths at different galaxy luminosities agrees very well with
the observational one derived by De Jong \& Lacey (1998). The evolution
of the disk size distribution to z=1 is predicted to be quite weak at
given luminosity, except for the most luminous galaxies, in
qualitative agreement with what is found from the CFRS redshift
survey.
They have also extended the model
to calculate the global HII region emission
line properties of galaxies. The results give
a good fit to the present-day H-alpha luminosity function of
galaxies, and can reproduce the
trend that the fraction of present-day galaxies with large OII
equivalent widths increases with decreasing luminosity. The effects of
dust on the emission line luminosity densities commonly used as star
formation tracers are found to be large, around 1 magnitude of
extinction for H-alpha and 2 magnitudes of extinction for the OII line
over the range z=0-5. Finally together with Padova scientists they
have made a combined stellar population/dust model which can predict
galaxy spectra from the UV to the
sub-mm, including both absorption and re-emission by dust. The result
gives a reasonable match to the observed FIR (60 micron)
luminosity function of galaxies at z=0, and predicts a steep
rise in the FIR luminosity density of the universe with increasing
redshift. This agrees qualitatively with inferences from
recent SCUBA observations (see 2b).

<B> 6 Simulations of galaxies and clusters </B>
<br><br>
Substantial progress was achieved in this area.
Activity took place at Durham, Munich, Paris and Padova, resulting
in 12 joint refereed publications and 7 conference proceedings involving
these institutions, particularly the first two.  In
order to take advantage of the unique opportunities offered by the
network's access to one of the largest parallel supercomputers in Europe,
the Cray-T3E in Garching, we deviated from our original
programme. Thus, during 1998 we carried out the ``Hubble volume''
simulations described below under 
``scientific highlights.'' This required developing and
implemented a new, highly efficient parallel N-body code. We also invested
substantial effort analysing the set of dark matter simulations which the
network and external collaborators had carried out the previous year as
described in our 1997 report. These simulations are the first to resolve
individual galactic halos in volumes large enough to provide reliable
clustering statistics. A variety of studies were carried out using these
data. Highlights include the most accurate study so far of the clustering
statistics of the dark matter (Jenkins et al 1998); detailed analyses of
the internal structure (Thomas et al 1998), velocity distributions
(Colberg et al 1998a), formation history (Tormen, Frenk \& White 1998),
and large-scale environment of galaxy cluster halos (Colberg et al 1998b);
a study, using novel techniques, of the topology of the dark matter
distribution and a comparison with recent galaxy surveys (Springel et al
1998, Canavezes et al 1998); analyses of the strong (Bartelmann et al
1998) and weak (Jenkins \& Bartelmann 1998) gravitational lensing
properties of clusters. Taken together, these studies represent the most
comprehensive analysis ever of a high precision set of dark matter
simulations and represent an important step towards the achievement of our
year 3 milestone. 
<br><br>
Our year 2 milestone (understanding the requirements for disk galaxies to
form with the observed properties) proved to be more difficult to achieve
than expected. Nevertheless, the TMR postdoc at Durham, Dr. Governato, and
other network researchers made progress in the subject, further developing
serial and parallel N-body/gasdynamic codes, including those written by
young network reseachers Springel and Carraro. These codes are being
applied not only to the formation of disks, but also to the formation of
ellipticals and to the effects of galaxy mergers. Results from this work
are already coming in. 
<br><br>
<UL>
<LI> Scientific highlights 
<br><br>
The ``Hubble volume'' simulations are the largest calculations ever
attempted of the formation of structure in the expanding Universe. They
represents one of the most intensive applications of supercomputing to a
civilian research project. With a billion particles, the Hubble volume
exceeds the previous largest simulation by over an order of magnitude in
size. It models the growth of clusters and larger structures over
virtually the entire observable universe. It allows study, for the first
time, of fundamental statistical properties of galaxy clusters, one of the
primary tools for cosmological research. The achievement represented by
this simulation attracted considerable media attention in Europe and the
USA.

<B> 7 Activities associated with the Hubble Deep Field South </B>
<br><br>
The observation by HST of a ``Deep Field" in the northern hemisphere has
stimulated enormous activity world-wide in areas
relevant to the ``Formation and Evolution of Galaxies". As soon as the
Space Telescope Director decided to conduct a similar effort
in the southern hemisphere, we decided to take steps to ensure that European
participation in this program would be substantial. Because European 
optical astronomy in the south is carried out primarily through the
European Southern Observatory (ESO), we decided at our 1997
annual meeting to initiate a ground-based follow-up effort of the
HST observations through ESO, with its main emphasis on spectroscopy.
<br><br>
A working group, coordinated by M. Dennefeld (Paris) and including 
members of most of the participating institutes, defined a
step-by-step program to obtain spectra for as many as galaxies as
possible around the Hubble Deep Field-South (HDF-S). To ensure that 
to complete this work as rapidly as possible, this ground-based program 
was started before the actual HST observations (taken in October 1998
and release November 23 1998) and a successful proposal was submitted
to ESO resulting in imaging of the full field and spectroscopy of the  
spectroscopy of the 200 brightest galaxies being obtained at the ESO
NTT in September and October 1998.
<br><br>
Simultaneously, coordination was set-up with ESO, who intended to do the 
corresponding ground-based deep imaging, to ensure that the
appropriate images and 
colours would be available for the next step, deep spectroscopy with the VLT.
Indeed, selection of the galaxies to be observed with the VLT will rely
on photometric redshifts derived from these deep images using a tool 
developed within the Network. The corresponding scientific program was 
defined during a special meeting held in Padova in June 1998, and refined at 
the annual Network meeting in Leiden in September 98.
<br><br>
Three major programmes were identified which capitalise on the
specific capabilities of the HST and VLT instrumentation, and a
proposal for the VLT time was submitted in each area (decision
expected December 1998). The first will measure
the cosmic star formation history directly in the redshift range where 
it is supposed to peak ($~ 1<z<2.5$). It will use the new VLT
IR instrument, ISAAC to detect the Halpha line, the tracer
of star formation traditionally used in nearby galaxies.
The second will search for high-redshift galaxies ($z > 3.5,$ with the
B drop-out technique) and use the FORS instrument on the VLT to derive
their redshifts and star formation rates. This will
determine whether star formation activity truly declines at high
redshift.  The third will investigate the nature and redshift of the faint
galaxies which are close to the QSO in the STIS field of the
HDF-S. Here FORS will be used to identify the galaxies responsible for
the absorption lines in the QSO spectrum, and to estimate the
metallicity of the gas component of galaxies at redshift 2.

<B> Networking Activities </B>
<br><br>
<UL>
<LI> Meetings
<br><br>
An international workshop, ``The most distant radio galaxies'',
was held in Amsterdam on 15-17 October 1997, involving participants 
from 5 network sites. A 500 page book 
containing the proceedings of the workshop is in press. 
<br><br>
The annual meeting of the network was held in Leiden  on 31st August to 5
September 1998, with 71 participants from the 6 network sites. Details
of the programme are given in the WWW pages.
<br><br>
A meeting was held at Cambridge during April/23-24/1998 to discuss
progress and future plans in the cosmological simulations of galaxy
formation. In addition to network participants, this meeting also included
external colleagues (from the Virgo consortium) who often collaborate with
network participants. The discussions were far ranging and included
coordination of the science to be done with the ``Hubble volume''
simulations as well as detailed planning for our programme of gas-dynamical
simulations of galaxy formation.
<br><br>
<LI> Training of young researchers
<br><br>
There have been substantial numbers of exchanges of young researchers
between sites. Currently one PhD student (A. Helmi from Leiden)
is carrying out her thesis work under the supervision of a scientist
at another site (S. White in Garching). Network funds are also
supporting an Italian student (S. Marri from Firenze) to pursue
doct
oral studies in Garching as part of a Firenze-Garching collaboration.
<br><br>
Of the researchers employed as Network postdoctoral Fellows, Philip
Best will remain in Leiden for 2 more years, Fabio Governato has left
Durham to take up an academic post in Milan, Bianca Poggianti has
left Cambridge for an academic post in Padova, Malcolm Bremer has
left Paris for a lectureship in Bristol, Itziar Aretxaga has left
Garching to take up a long-term research post in Puebla (Mexico), and
Yuen Ng has left Padova for a post at the Space Research Organisation
of the Netherlands. The new Network Fellows are: in Cambridge
Pierre-Alain Duc (a Frenchman previously at ESO, Garching), in
Durham Sergio Gelato (an Italian previously in Copenhagen), in
Garching Tom Theuns (a Belgian previously at Cambridge), in Padova
Herve Aussel (a Frenchman previously in Paris) and in Paris, Steve
Hatton (an Englishman from Durham). Almost all these researchers
already have active collaborations in more than one Network site.
