<H1>Trail Shock - Studies Weigh Mountain Biking and Hiking Impacts</H1>

<H3>New research suggests that mountain bikes and boots leave equal wear and tear on trails.</H3>

<P>

<P> Lead photo: Mountain biker near lake. Caption "New research suggests that
mountain bikes and boots leave equal wear and tear on trails. How bikers ride and
where hikers step may make more of a difference." </P>

<P> Describing himself as "sort of stubborn," Bob Moss is the type of person who
questions assumptions. So in the 1990s, when he saw the New York-New Jersey Trail
Conference (NY-NJTC) and other hiking groups angrily blaming trail widening and
ruts on mountain bikers, he decided to conduct his own study. </P>

<P> A few years ago, he began counting hikers and mountain bikes and monitoring
the condition of trails in New Jersey's Ringwood State Park, near his home. After
months of observation, though, he realized he didn't have enough time to
correlate the types of users and trail impacts. But he did note that trails
popular with mountain bikers sometimes widened in spots. </P>

<P> Moss enters this emotional issue as no defender of mountain bikers. "I really
don't like bicycles in the woods," he says, "but I also don't like people talking
and not knowing (what they're talking about). At all these meetings it always
seemed to me the same thing: the bicyclists saying, 'We don't damage the trails,'
and the hikers saying (to bikers), 'You're ruining them.' That's where the
curiosity came from," </P>

<P> He is not alone in pondering the question of whether mountain bikes
accelerate trail erosion more than the boots of hikers - something some hikers,
especially on the Northeast's heavily used trails, have alleged for years. As
NY-NJSTC President Gary Haugland says, "We are a trail-maintaining organization.
We see the evidence of (bike) impacts," Since the mid-1980s, a host of scientific
studies has attempted to measure the comparative effects of hiking boots and fat
tires on trails. But interviews with hiking and bicycling groups and researchers
in the field - including the co-author of a new study slated for publication this
year - reveal that very little hard data exist to prove conclusively that bikes do
more damage to trails than do boots. And those studies that have examined the
evidence widely conclude that the charge against mountain bikes simply does not
stick. </P>

<P> Many people interviewed for this story cite a 1995 study conducted by
researcher Gordon Cessford for the New Zealand Department of Conservation, which
concluded, "It has not been established in the research done to date that
mountain bikes have greater overall impact on tracks than do walkers." Another
researcher, Donald Weir an environmental consultant and engineer in Alberta,
Canada, authored a report in 2000 that synthesized the findings of various
studies.  "I found there's very little statistical difference (in physical impact
on a trail between a hiker and a mountain bicyclist," Weir says. </P>

<P> As a result of her graduate research at the University of Guelph in Ontario,
Canada, Eden Thurston co-authored a paper to be published this year in the
Journal of Environmental Management on a study that measured trail damage from an
equal number of one-way downhill passes by bikers and hikers on 10-15 degree
slopes on an Ontario park. Thurston's study took place on about 667 acres at an
elevation of approzimaterly 1,350 feet, in maple forest with fine, sandy-loam
soils. Hikers and bikers traveled over separate plots of ground, with researchers
measuring the effects at intervals up to 500 passes. While emphasizing that her
work "isn't the last word on this topic, (and) a lot more needs to be done," she
found "there was no significant difference in the direct physical impacts of
hikers and mountain bikers." </P>

<P> "There seems to be a suburban myth that observable trail degradation is the
result of mountain biking," says Thurston. "People can see the tire treads, but
is that really causing trail erosion?" </P>

<P> Yu-Fai Leung Ph.D, an assistant professor at North Carolina State University,
who has examined trail erosion for the National Park service and others, says the
type and amount of use has far less to do with erosion than factors like amount
of rainfall and trail steepness and design. "Environmental factors" - including
trail slope and precipitation  - "have more to do with (causing) erosion." </P>

<P> "Mountain-bike impact (is most likely to result from) someone skidding
brakes, which is bad technique and not a good thing to do," says Phil Keyes of
the New England Mountain Bike Association (NEMBA). Keyes agrees with many
researchers that "water going down a trail does infinitely more damage than
bikes." But critics in the Northeast charge that research results so far have
reflected other regions' soils, topography, and more dispersed use, and therefore
don't necessarily apply here, The NY-NJTC is interested in finding answers to
these questions based on conditions in the Northeast, according to Haugland, Late
in 2000, the NY-NJTC formed an advisory committee of scientists from various
disciplines to examine trail erosion. As of early February, the committee had
just begun to meet and had no timetable for releasing findings. </P>

<P> "We have to move the issue beyond out respective passions," Haugland says.
"Our feeling is that the data (from elsewhere) don't conform to the needs here in
the eastern forest. We see the evidence of (bike) impacts, but it has not been
studied scientifically." </P>

<P> If, in fact, boot and tire impacts do turn out be roughly equivalent, is
biker-hiker animosity likely to evaporate? No, suggests other research that
concludes conflicts between recreational user groups arise partly because one
group considers another's behavior unacceptable, and their motivations for being
outdoors are very different. Andrew Norkin, the AMC's White Mountains Trails
manager, points out, "There were that historically were limited to hiking before
biking came along, and folks weren't receptive to a new user group" </P>


<P> Scott Reid of Leave No Trace, which advocates low-impact recreational
practices, calls the problem "a turf thing. Especially in the East, the trails
have been built by hikers, they've put in the sweat equity, and suddenly along
cones the new kid on the block riding fast, skidding around turns, and they're
loud.  There are social issues." </P>

<P> What's the solution? In the 1990s, the NY-NJTC actively opposed "the
redesignation of hiking trails as mountain biking trails without our knowledge of
consent," Haugland says, while also encouraging land managers to establish
separate bike trails. "We believe that in order to serve hikers and mountain
bikers, there need to be separate networks of trails." The AMC trail-use policy
also recognizes that in some cases land managers "should consider designated
single-use trails" in a given areas and "may wish to designate
mountain-biking-only trails as well." George Cartamil, a volunteer
trailmaintenance supervisor with the AMC's New York-North Jersey Chapter, points
out that he has advocated for parks allowing mountain-bike groups to build their
own trails. But he says he has yet to see the bike community step forward. </P>

<P> "Even if bikers did build their own trails, Cartamil adds, they will invade
hikers' trails. What are you going to have, a ranger on every trail? That's
impossible. It's an ongoing battle, and it creates a constant friction between
both groups." </P>

<P> Back in New Jersey, Bob Moss points to Ringwood State Park as a model for
reducing conflicts between mountain bikers and hikers. The park set up a
single-track bike race route. Plus, bikers have approached him seeking advice on
how to avoid trail widening, and Moss later saw where bikers had done trail work.
"There are ways to build trails that will stand up to bicycle use or heavy hiking
use," Moss says. "If there are enough trails to keep mountain bikers happy and
they don't have to go on hiking trails, that should take care of the problem."
</P>

<P> <H3>(Sidebar) Why Wheels Seem Worse</H3> </P>

<P> Why does it sometimes seem that mountain biking damages trails more than
hiking does? Here are two ideas posed by researchers: "It would appear that the
main physical impact from the advent of mountain-biking really lies in the
increase in user numbers., rather than in the nature of then new activity." -
"Off-Road Impacts of Mountain Bikes: a Review and discussion." Gordon R.
Cessford, <I>Science & Research Series No. 92</I>, 1995; Department of Conservation,
Wellington, New Zealand. </P>

<P> "Bikers enjoy the challenge of obstacles on the trail, such as gullies,
roots, rocks, and water. Many of these features are the result of erosion. If
mountain bikers seek out eroded areas, then bikes will contribute further to soil
erosion."  - <I>Impacts of Experimentally Applied Mountain Biking and Hiking on the
Vegetation and Soil of a Deciduous Forest.</I> Eden Thurston and Richard J. Reader,
University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada (to be published in a 201 issue of the
<I>Journal of Environmental Management</I>). </P>
