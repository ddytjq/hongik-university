<P>
Tornados are violently rotating columns of air capable of tossing cattle, 
destroying houses, and demolishing virtually anything in their paths. They're 
strong enough to obliterate large buildings, lift 20-ton railroad cars from 
their tracks, and drive blades of grass into telephone poles. They'll also muss 
up your hair big-time.
<P>
Where do tornados derive so much of their strength? Rotation! They spin, twirl, and 
twist their way through small towns wreaking havoc everywhere they go. If 
tornadoes only went up and down, left and right, or to-and-fro they wouldn't be 
nearly as daunting. In fact, if they didn't gyrate they wouldn't be anything 
more than a strong wind. It's their <I>rotational power</I> that makes them 
nature's most violent storms. Just think about kind of power <I>you</I> could 
achieve if your rotational ability were stronger. Do you think it would it 
affect how much weight you could lift in the gym? It most certainly 
would.<BR>

<b>Anatomy of Rotation</b></font>
<P>
Though there are many different muscles recruited for the job of trunk 
rotation. The top two heavy hitters are the oblique brothers &#8212; internal and 
external. Together they create the mean rotational ability of our trunk and 
lower torso. The internal oblique begins at the iliac crest and thoracolumbar 
fascia and inserts into the last four ribs (9-12) and the linea alba (Figure 
1A).
<P>
This oblique has numerous functions one of which includes stabilization of the lumbar spine through its connection with the thoracolumbar fascia. In addition to assisting with stability of the lumbar spine and pelvis, the internal obliques are considered ipsilateral rotators when our pelvis is anchored and contralateral rotators while our truck is anchored. 
<TABLE align=left border=0 cellPadding=10 cellSpacing=0 width=100>

<TR><TD><DIV align=center><FONT color="darkgreen" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2">Figure 1B</FONT></DIV></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
This is a difficult concept for many to grasp, so allow me to explain. When your 
upper body is free to move and your lower body is fixed (i.e. while standing or 
sitting), the direction you rotate uses that particular internal oblique (Figure 
1B). For example, when you turn your body to the left, your <I>left</I> internal 
oblique would contract to pull you in that direction. Ipsilateral means 
"affecting the same side of the body," so if something is an ipsilateral 
rotator, it means whichever side you rotate to, a particular muscle contracts on 
that side. A contralateral rotator on the other hand means that whichever side 
you rotate to, a muscle on the opposite side will contract. Confused? Don't be. 
Read on and it should all come together.

</TABLE>
<P>
Also helping with the job of rotation are the external obliques. Being the largest of the abdominal muscles per square inch, they have just as many roles as the 
internal obliques, if not more. Among their functions are, torso rotation, side 
flexion, pelvis stabilization and rib cage stabilization. The external obliques 
run from the external surfaces of the last 8 ribs to the anterior portion of the 
iliac crest and the aponeruosis of the anterior abdominal wall (Figure 2A). 
Whereas the fibers of the internal oblique go from our pelvis upward toward our 
rib cage, the fibers of the external obliques go from our sides downward toward 
our pelvis. In fact, when you put your hands into your front pants pockets, the 
direction of your hands and fingers run roughly the same direction the fibers of 
the external obliques. The internal obliques run almost perpendicular to them. 
<TABLE align=left border=0 cellPadding=10 cellSpacing=0 width=100>
<TR><TD><IMG src="images/muscle4.jpg" width="125" height="181"</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><DIV align="center"><FONT color="darkgreen" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2">Figure 2B</FONT></DIV></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Because of the massive origin on the last 8 ribs, the external obliques 
serve to stabilize our ribcage during dynamic movement. How might this relate to 
you? If you participate in a combative sport such as boxing or martial arts, 
it's important to stabilize your rib cage when you take a punch or kick. For 
those of you that Olympic lift and perform the snatch, you too have a tremendous 
need to stabilize your rib cage. When you snatch a weight overhead, there's a 
tremendous load going through your arms into your shoulder girdle, which sits on 
your rib cage. If you can't adequately stabilize your ribs, the force being 
driven through your arms and shoulder girdle instead becomes dissipated into 
your spine! (Can you see the importance of having the rotational power of a 
tornado yet?)
<P>
Another function of the external obliques is to stabilize the pelvis, 
which will in turn help to stabilize the lumbar spine. In fact according to 
Kendall, because the external obliques can rotate the pelvis posteriorly, they 
act functionally as lower abdominal muscles. The inability to stabilize your 
pelvis may make you more susceptible to a lower extremity and/or back injury. 
<P>
Last, but not least, both sets of obliques assist in side flexion.
<P>
Whereas the internal obliques are an ipsilateral rotator of the trunk 
while the pelvis is fixed, the external obliques act as a <I>contralateral</I> 
rotator of the trunk while the pelvis is fixed. Going back to the previous 
example: if you are sitting and rotate your upper body to the left, your 
<I>right</I> external oblique will contract (Figure 2B). Therefore rotation to 
the left while your pelvis is fixed is accomplished by the <I>left</I> internal 
oblique and <I>right</I> external oblique. Figure 3 may help you visualize this 
a bit more effectively.

</TABLE>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,helvetica,arial, sans-serif" SIZE="-1" color="darkgreen">
<b>Importance of Rotation</b></font>
<P>
Both the internal and external obliques play an important role in stabilization of 
our pelvis and lumbar spine. Typically an unstable pelvis and lumbar spine are 
the weakest link in people and when we have a weak link in our body, we won't be 
able to lift as much weight as we're capable of lifting. As far as our body is 
concerned, when we're unstable, we're more likely to injure ourselves if we lift 
as much as we want. As an example, have you ever tried to set down a heavy 
object onto a weak table? Chances are that when you realized how unstable the 
table was, you removed the heavy object and put it elsewhere. Why? You decided 
the table might break and you didn't want it to hold the load. Our bodies are no 
different! If our brain realizes that we are unstable and that we might break if 
we go too far, it simply won't let us lift a certain load.
<P>
In fact, try this with a training buddy: Have him stick out his arm to the side and 
keep it there while you push it down. Now, have him draw his belly button inward 
toward his spine as far as possible and, while keeping the belly button inward, 
try to press his arm down again. If all went well, he was probably much stronger 
the second time. This is because the body senses a greater level of stability 
and allows you to use more muscle &#8212; you're able to use more of your strength 
because your body senses that you're stable and can handle it.
<P>
Increased strength via a more stable body is merely one reason we should 
train our obliques and rotational ability.
<P>
Next time you're walking, notice what your upper body does in relation to your lower 
body. To counteract the inertia of our leg during the swing phase of gait, your 
upper body rotates in the opposite direction so you can continue walking in a 
straight line. When our right leg comes forward, our upper body <I>rotates</I> 
left. Barring a injury or specific condition, if we're moving, chances are we're 
rotating!
<P>If we rotate while walking, think about how the necessity to rotate increases when we're jogging or even sprinting. The importance of rotation is obvious for 
athletes. Some examples include people in combative sports (kicking, punching), 
golfers (swinging), baseball players (swinging, throwing), swimmers (constantly 
rotating during the crawl stroke), and the list goes on! Rotation is 
<I>life,</I> and if we can't rotate we're vastly deficient in a very important 
movement pattern.
<P>Suffice it to say that functional training for our obliques isn't an 
option, it's a must! For injury prevention, low back stabilization, sports 
performance or increasing how much we can lift in the gym, we all would do well 
to develop that tornado-like rotational power that's so devastating in 
nature!

</TABLE>
<P>
Just for a moment, think about the most feared and devastating Warner Bros. cartoon 
character during Bugs' era. I'll give you a hint, he was furry, drooled 
veraciously, grunted, had an insatiable appetite, and could rotate with blinding 
speed. Give up? Taz! That diminutive juggernaut, otherwise known as the 
Tazmanian Devil, wreaked havoc everywhere he went by destroying anything in his 
path. But take a good look at him. He has skinny arms and legs! Yet, when he 
starts spinning, everyone runs for cover. The moral of this story is, you can 
have the biggest arms or legs in the world but if you can't rotate, you'll be as 
weak as Porky Pig.

<b>Exercises to Improve Rotational Strength</b></font>
<P>
Most people don't incorporate rotational exercises into their training regimen. 
Therefore, I recommend starting slow to minimize your chance of injury. These 
first few exercises might seem mild by some people's standards, but again, if 
you're new to rotational exercises, it would be wise to start with these. 
<br><br><br>
<FONT FACE="verdana,helvetica,arial, sans-serif" SIZE="-1 color="darkgreen">
<b>GYM AND SWISS BALL EXERCISES</b>
<P>
<B>Swiss Ball Supine Russian Twist </B></font>
<P>
Begin this exercise by lying supine on a Swiss Ball with your shoulders in the middle of the ball. Put your hands together out in front of your body and place your 
tongue on the roof of your mouth just behind your front teeth. (If you're 
uncertain where to place your tongue, swallow and make note of where your tongue 
goes &#8212; that's the position.) Gently draw your belly button in and begin rotating you torso left to right, making sure you don't drop your hips.
<P>
Once performing 10-12 repetitions to each side becomes easy, you can make it more 
challenging by either speeding up the movement, placing a weight in your hands, 
or both.
<TABLE align=center border=0 cellPadding=10 cellSpacing=0 width=100>
<TR><TD><IMG src="images/muscle8.jpg" width="300" height="248"

<P>
<FONT FACE="verdana,helvetica,arial, sans-serif" SIZE="-1" color="darkgreen">
<B>Swiss Ball Prone Russian Twist</B></font>
<P>
Whereas many oblique and rotational exercises are performed by rotating 
the upper torso, this variation on the Russian Twist rotates the lower torso. In 
doing so, the obliques will be used in a completely different recruitment 
pattern than upper torso rotation exercises.
<P>
Begin with your hands on the ground in a push up position and put your knees, with a 
90° angle, on the apex of the ball. Draw your belly button in toward your spine 
while slowly dropping and rotating your knees to the left. When your legs become 
parallel to the ground, use your obliques to rotate your knees back to the 
starting position. Repeat this process on both sides for the desired number of 
reps or until your form begins to break down. While performing this exercise, 
make sure to maintain the same hip and knee angle you started the exercise with 
&#8212; do not straighten your legs out as you drop your knees to the side.
<P>
Once you have become adept at this exercise, you can make it more challenging by 
speeding up the tempo of movement.

<B>Swiss Ball Oblique Crunch</B></font>
<P>
Most of you have probably performed some type of oblique crunch from the floor, but 
until you have performed it on a Swiss Ball, you haven't been getting the most 
out of the exercise. In fact, Swiss Ball crunches are superior to most other 
types of crunches, but since this is a rotational article, I'll stick with the 
topic.
<P>
Roll back over a ball with your head touching the ball, but don't roll too far or 
you're liable to fall off. Put your tongue on the roof of your mouth just behind 
your front teeth to stabilize your neck. Draw your belly button in and with your 
finger tips resting lightly on your ears, begin curling up from your head while 
simultaneous rotating to one side. Slowly reverse the curl until you've reached 
the starting position. You now have the option of curling to the same side or 
alternating sides until you've reached the desired number of reps.
<P>
Once this become easy, you can turbocharge the exercise by placing your arms above 
your head or by adding weight to the movement. If adding weight, be sure to 
anchor your feet with at least twice the weight you're using to prevent you from 
falling backward off the ball.
<P>
You can also perform this movement using a medicine ball and a partner &#8212; toss the ball to your partner as you crunch and rotate and have them toss it back to you 
as you're on the way back down to the starting position. The closer the ball is 
to the head, the less load there will be on the abdominals. Remember, start 
slow!

<B>Wood Chop</B></font>
<P>
The wood chop is one of the most effective exercises for oblique conditioning that I 
know of! Begin standing next to a cable column apparatus with a single handle 
attachment. Reaching across your body, grab the handle with the hand furthest 
from the cable and then place your other hand over the first one. Keeping your 
arms straight with a slight bend in your elbows and knees, draw your belly 
button in and pull the cable diagonally across the body, finishing when the 
handle is just outside your opposite foot. Slowly return to the starting 
position and continue performing the movement for the desired number of 
repetitions.
<P>
While performing this exercise, be sure to keep good posture so your obliques are 
trained in a vertical axis. Lastly, try to keep the movement purely rotational 
with minimal flexion at the end of the movement. I also recommend shifting your 
weight from leg to leg while performing the exercise to integrate the upper and 
lower torso in a functional movement pattern. Once you have performed the 
desired number of repetitions on one side, perform the same number on the other 
side.

Try these exercises for a while and in Part II of this article, I'll show you more 
dynamic rotational exercises by incorporating the use of a medicine ball and my 
new Tornado Ball!
