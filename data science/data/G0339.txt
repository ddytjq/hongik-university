      a new astrophysical mystery came banging on the door. It was
      a burst of gamma radiation so strong that it swamped detectors.
      It was the calling card for a new type of star - the magnetar
      - that only recently has captured public attention.</P>

      <P>On March 5, 1979, the gamma ray burst detectors on a number
      of satellites rang off the scale. Most of the research on the
      burst was done by a team led by Dr. Thomas Cline of NASA's Goddard
      Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. But long after the afterglow
      had faded, the burst continued to reverberate throughout the
      astrophysics community.</P>

      &quot;It was a very historic event,&quot; said Dr. Gerald Fishman,
      at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. Fishman is principal
      investigator for the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE),
      an instrument aboard the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory used to
      study gamma ray flashes in space. The March 5, 1979, burst came
      12 years before the launch of Compton, and before the other astrophysics
      satellites now in use. Still, the burst spurred interest in the
      field.</P>

      <P>&quot;Nothing like it has happened since then,&quot; Fishman
      continued. &quot;It was quite exciting because here was a tremendous
      blast seen by eight or nine spacecraft across the solar system.&quot;</P>

      <P>The amazing thing is that it saturated every single detector,
      keeping scientists from getting an accurate measure of the energy
      peak.</P>

      <P>&quot;To this day, there hasn't been another like it,&quot;
      said Dr. Charles Meegan, a co-investigator on the BATSE team,
      also at NASA/Marshall.

      </TABLE>The burst was just 2/10ths of a second long - with as
      much energy as the sun releases in 1,000 years, and was followed
      by a 100-second tail.</P>

      <P>&quot;Our first reaction was that the initial spike was an
      instrumental effect,&quot; said Dr. Chryssa Kouveliotou of the
      Universities Space Research Association working at NASA/Marshall.
      Kouveliotou then was a graduate student at the Max Planck Institute
      for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany. She was working
      on her doctorate in astrophysics, using data from the third International
      Sun-Earth Explorer (ISEE-3) which carried one of the instruments
      that detected the burst.</P>

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Compounding a mystery</FONT></B><BR>
      Gamma ray bursts had been mystifying astrophysicists since the
      late 1960s when they were discovered by satellites designed to
      monitor compliance with a treaty banning nuclear weapons tests
      in space. The discovery of this phenomenon led scientists to
      piggyback small detectors on a number of science satellites including
      interplanetary probes. By looking at the different times that
      the signals arrived at various satellites, the scientists could
      get a better fix on the location of the burst sources.

      Magellan's flotilla that circled the globe in 1520-21. The Large
      Magellanic Cloud - where SGR 0526-66 is believed to reside -

      <P>&quot;There was a lot of debate about whether it really was
      from the Large Magellanic Cloud, or was a coincidental overlap,&quot;
      Meegan said. Until then, scientists had thought that most bursts
      occurred within our galaxy. For the bursts to come from outside
      the galaxy would require an immense amount of energy in order
      to appear so strong here.

      <P>&quot;A lot of people believed this was an LMC event,&quot;
      Kouveliotou said. &quot;A great many others did not, simply because
      of the energetics involved.&quot;</P>

      <P>&quot;It was very strong,&quot; Meegan said. &quot;We wondered,
      Why should the strongest burst be far away? That led us to think
      that we are dealing with something different.&quot;</P>

      <P>But the error box was the smallest that had ever been established
      for a gamma ray burst, and put the apparent source inside the
      remnant of a supernova known as N49.</P>

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Pulses in the afterglow</FONT></B><BR>
      The mystery deepened when scientists examined the tail which
      showed a series of pulses that indicated something was rotating
      and beaming energy.</P>

      <P>&quot;That was the astounding thing,&quot; Meegan continued.
      &quot;No one had never seen any period before. That helped convince
      a lot of people, incorrectly, that gamma-ray bursts are from
      neutron stars in our galaxy.&quot;</P>

      <P>A pulsar - a rapidly rotating neutron star - does not really
      pulse. It actually beams radiation continuously from its north
      and south magnetic poles. The magnetic poles are normally offset
      from the geographic poles, so the star's rotation sweeps the
      beam across the sky like a lighthouse. For an observer who happens
      to be in the right place, the star appears to pulse on and off.</P>

      <P>&quot;The 8-second period seen in the tail was very first
      coherent modulation observed in a gamma ray burst,&quot; Kouveliotou
      explained.

      <P>The March 5, 1979, event was not the first or last gamma-ray
      eruption from the LMC object. Dr. Evgeny Mazets of the Ioffe
      Institute in Moscow noticed that a series of 16 events had come
      from the same general area of the sky, and that the energies
      of each lay in the region of the electromagnetic spectrum where
      the nomenclature changes from X-rays to gamma rays.</P>

      <P>During 1985-86, Dr. Kevin Hurley of the University of California
      at Berkeley collected data obtained by a number of scientists
      and realized that some bursts seemed to be coming from the same
      general part of the sky, on the plane of the Milky Way galaxy.
      International collaboration led to discovery of another source
      at 1806-20 (18 hours, 6 minutes right ascension, -20 deg. declination).</P>

      <P>It was time to try to put a name on the new sources. During
      an international space science meeting in Toulouse, France, in
      1986, a group of 50 astrophysicists discussed what had been learned
      to date.

      They also selected a name. Soft Gamma Repeater - SGR - was easier
      to say than Hard X-ray Repeater - HXR - although both describe
      the spectral range and fact that they have repeated bursts.</P>

      <P>At this point they had just three SGRs: the March 5, 1979
      object at 0526-66, Hurley's object at 1806-20, and a third at
      1900+14 (again, the numbers indicate the position in the sky).
      For a long time, SGRs were listed as a peculiar subset of the
      larger mystery of Gamma Ray Bursts, beasts that appear at totally
      random times and, as astronomers gradually learned, totally random
      locations in the sky.</P>

      <P>Eventually, BATSE led scientists to separate the two. BATSE
      showed that the true Gamma-Ray Bursts are scattered across the
      sky, and not grouped along the plane of the Milky Way galaxy.
      That means that they are associated with the deep cosmos rather
      than just with our galaxy. Later discoveries proved that the
      bursts are deep in the universe and thus almost unbelievably
      powerful.</P>

      <P>Meanwhile, the SGR mystery headed towards resolution. In 1992,
      Dr. Robert Duncan of the University of Texas in Austin and Dr.
      Chris Thompson of the University of North Carolina at Chapel
      Hill formulated their magnetar theory.

      <P>This was a radical new concept. When a massive, rapidly rotating

      20 km (12 mi) and having a density so great that a pinhead of
      neutron star material would weigh as much as a battleship. It's
      also so hot that for the first 30 seconds or so it circulates
      as hot neutron liquid rises to the surface, cools, and sinks.
      This motion generates a magnetic field. If the star is spinning
      at 200 rotations/second or more (more than 360 times faster than
      an old 33-1/3 record), it sets up a dynamo effect that generates

      it sets up a dynamo effect that forms an intense magnetic field,
      and a magnetar is born.</FONT></P>

      <P>&quot;In ordinary neutron stars the crust is stable, but in
      magnetars, the crust is stressed by unbearable forces as the
      colossal magnetic field drifts through it,&quot; said Duncan.
      &quot;This deforms the crust and sometimes cracks it.&quot; Violent
      seismic waves then shake the star's surface, generating Alfv&eacute;n
      waves - the electromagnetic equivalent of a Slinky toy - which
      energize clouds of particles above the surface of the star. These
      cause most of the bursts attributed to SGRs.</P>

      <P>Initially, Duncan and Thompson offered their theory to explain
      gamma ray bursts and, possibly, SGRs. In time, they and other
      scientists realized that while the explanation for bursts remains
      elusive, they probably had found the solution for SGRs and for
      another odd character, the Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXP). For
      some years, scientists had been looking at AXPs, neutron stars
      associated with young supernova remnants, but with but with rotation
      periods much longer than found previously in young neutron stars.</P>

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Observational confirmation</FONT></B><BR>
      Support for the magnetar theory came early in 1998. In 1996,
      the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) had observed SGR 1806-20.
      Kouveliotou and her colleagues discovered a period within persistent
      X-ray emissions. They then looked at earlier observations by
      Japan's Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA)
      and found the same period. She found that SGR 1806-20's rotation
      was slowing at the rate of 1 second every 300 years. What seems
      like a miniscule effect, Kouveliotou calculated, required an
      immense cause: an intense magnetic field that is applying the
      brakes to the neutron star.</P>

      <P>Those results were published in <I>Nature</I> on May 21, 1998.
      Just a month later, a fourth source, SGR 1627-41, was discovered.

        SGR outbursts come in two forms. Most are starquakes that occur
        when the kilometer-thick metallic crust shifts and pumps energy
        into the plasmasphere around the neutron star. Such an event
        is depicted here. The really big bursts, like the March 5th 1979
        event, are caused by sudden readjustments of the. (Images by
        Dr. Robert Mallozzi, University of Alabama in Huntsville)</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P>Meanwhile, things were picking up. Kouveliotou, Hurley, and
      others were observing SGR 1900+14, first in April with ASCA,
      then on May 26 with BATSE when it erupted, and then with RXTE
      during June 1-9 where they found the SGR's spindown rate could
      be measured even in the space of a few days. Then, on August
      27, 1998, SGR 1900+14 really sounded off. Hurley saw a clear
      series of pulsations in data recorded by a detector on the Ulysses
      probe out near Jupiter. The Advanced Satellite for Cosmology
      and Astrophysics and the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer also recorded
      the burst.</P>

      <P>It had almost the same apparent brightness as the March 1979
      event burst by SGR 0526-66. But because the Large Magellanic
      Cloud containing SGR 0526-66 is about 8 times more distant than
      SGR 1900+14, SGR 0526-66 was intrinsically 64 times brighter.</P>

      <P>As with the March 5, 1979 burst, a long tail with strong pulsations
      was recorded. The intensity and other factors led scientists
      to confirm that SGR 1900+14 is a magnetar, like SGR 1806-20.
      The burst apparently was caused by an out-of-control magnetic
      field adjusting itself in a manner similar to what happens inside
      solar flares.</P>

      <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">At the head of the class</FONT></B><BR>
      After almost two decades, SGRs had graduated to be the most vocal
      of a new class of stars, magnetars, also comprising AXPs and
      &quot;dead&quot; magnetars that have wound down and become silent
      and, to Earthlings, invisible.</P>

      <P>So what's next?</P>

      <P>&quot;We keep observing SGRs and AXPs with every satellite
      we've got,&quot; Kouveliotou said. &quot;You never know what
      more surprises are out there.&quot;</P>

      <P>That means whenever possible, watching with ASCA, Rossi X-ray
      Timing Explorer, and - later this year - the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
