  <br>

  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>TYPICAL EXAMPLE</b></font>
  <br>
  An application for a repayment mortgage of £30,000 secured over 25 years on a
  purchase price of £50,000, 300 monthly mortgage payments of £189.84. Total amount
  payable £57,291.62, includes valuation fee of £125, solicitors charge of **£110.45
  (estimated), initial interest £54.17 and redemption fee £50, assuming completion on
  20th November 2001.
  <br><br>
  ** The solicitors estimated charge shown above is only an illustrative figure for the 
  preparation of the mortgage deed and does not take account of other work that the
  solicitor will need to carry out on your behalf.
  <br><br>
  Example assumes rate of 5.69% (APR 6.1%). Rates quoted including APR are variable.
  APR shown is typical of a repayment mortgage of 25 years. Building insurance is required.
  A detailed written quotation for a specific situation is available from the Society
  on request. Minimum age is 18 years.
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>WHAT ARE THE COSTS?</b></font>
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b><i>Valuation and Administration Fee</i></b></font>
  <br>
  The Society is required by law to have a valuation of the subject property carried out by a 
  suitably qualified professional valuer. The valuation report is for the use of the Society
  to assess the adequacy of the security for mortgage purposes and is not a full structural survey.
  A copy of this report will be included with the offer of mortgage. Basic valuation fee charges are
  as indicated below, or if you wish, the Society can arrange a Home Buyers Report or a Structural
  Survey. Included within the overall fee payable is an administration fee which goes towards the
  Society's administration costs when processing a mortgage application.
  <br><br>

  <b>From time to time the Society's mortgage schemes may offer a free of charge basic valuation.</b>
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b><i>Scale of Valuation Fees <font size=1>(including Administration fee)</font></i></b></font>
  <br>    
  The charge for the valuation is payable to the Society and is in accordance with the following scales:

  <br>
  Where considerable improvements are to be made, the estimated cost of such should be added to the purchase
  price and the valuation charge based on the total cost.
  <br><br>
  Where the advance is made conditional on completion of either the property or work specified in the offer
  of advance, an extra £35 is charged for each visit by the valuer.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b><i>Solicitors Fees</i></b></font>
  <br>  
  When mortgaging a property the services of a solicitor are required and you will be 
  responsible for meeting all the costs. In order to establish the fees involved you
  will need to speak to your chosen firm of solicitors.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b><i>Initial Interest</i></b></font>
  <br>     
  The charge for initial interest covers the interest due on the loan in the month it commences.
  A separate payment is required to cover this as it is not included within the regular monthly
  payment that starts the month after commencement of the mortgage.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b><i>Redemption of Mortgages</i></b></font>
  <br> 
  The administration charge for the vacating and discharge of a mortgage is £50.
  <br><br>
 
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>THE MORTGAGE CODE AND THE BANKING CODE</b></font>
  <br>
  Barnsley Building Society subscribes to both of the above Codes which set standards of good
  Mortgage Lending and Banking practice. Copies of the Codes are held at the Society's Head Office
  and its branches and will be given out on request.
  <br><br>
  Under the Mortgage Code the Society offers three levels of service to all customers dealing direct
  with the Society to help them choose a mortgage, these being:
  <ul type=square>
    <li>Advice and recommendation as to which of our mortgage products is most suitable
        for you based on your particular requirements.
    <li>Information on the range of mortgage products we offer.
    <li>Information on a particular mortgage product from our range, if you have made up your mind already.
  </ul>
  We can also provide information on a particular mortgage chosen by a customer applying to the Society 
  through a mortgage intermediary.
