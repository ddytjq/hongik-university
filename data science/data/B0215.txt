          </font><font size="3"><b><font size="2">Administration Fee</font></b><font size="2"> 
          - This is a fee charged which is not refundable if the mortgage application 
          does not proceed. The Administration fee will often form part of the 
          valuation fee but will be retained by the lender even if the valuation 
          has not been carried out. </font></font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>A.E.R.</b> - Annual Equivalent Rate - This illustrates what the interest 
          rate would be if the interest was paid onto the account and compounded 
          each year. As every advert for savings products will contain an AER 
          the consumer will be able to compare more easily the expected return 
          from differing products. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Annual Percentage Rate</b> - This is meant to show the true cost 
          of borrowing and adjusts the notional interest rate to take account 
          of all the initial fees and ongoing costs to reflect the real cost of 
          borrowing throughout the entire mortgage term. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Annuity Mortgage</b> - (See Repayment Mortgage) </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Arrangement Fee</b> - This is a fee charged in order to access particular 
          mortgage deals. Arrangement fees particularly apply if you are looking 
          for a fixed rate or discounted rate mortgage and these may either be 
          payable up front, added to the loan on completion, or deducted from 
          the loan on completion. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Arrears</b> &#150; Contracted mortgage payment not made by the due 
          date. Applicants who have arrears on a current mortgage may experience 
          problems if attempting to arrange a new mortgage through the mainstream 
          lenders. </font></p>

          of the banking industry , issuing of money and more recently the control 
          of inflation , with the formation of the Monetary Policy Committee under 
          the new Labour government. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Base Rate</b> - The minimum rate at which banks are prepared to lend 
          money , altered by the central bank's dealing rates with the discount 
          houses. It forms the benchmark for all other interest rates. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Basic Rate of Tax</b> - The basic rate of income tax is set in the 
          annual budget. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Basis Point</b> - Unit of measure (usually one hundredth of a percentage 
          point) used to express movements in interest rates, foreign rates or 
          bond yields. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Beneficiary</b> - The recipient of the assets subject to a Will or 
          Trust. Essentially the nominated receiver of the benefit from the proceeds 
          of a Will/Trust usually specified in the documentation. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Bonus</b> - Additional payment of interest if defined conditions 
          are met, typically if an investment is held for a certain term or if 
          withdrawals are kept under a certain limit. </font></p>

          <b>Capital and Interest Mortgage</b> - ( see Repayment Mortgage ) </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Capital </b>- Amount of money invested , not including interest earned 
          that may have been added to it. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>C.A.R.</b> &#150; Compounded Annual Rate - The annual rate of interest 
          that will be earned if , interest is credited to an account monthly, 
          quarterly or biannually and allowed to remain on the account for that 
          year. The rate will therefore be higher then the quoted standard rate 
          and will enable comparisons with other accounts quoting annual rates. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Capital Raising</b> - Normally refers to a Remortgage when additional 
          funds are taken over and above the amount required to repay the existing 
          mortgage debt which is then used for personal finance purposes. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Capped Rate</b> - A capped rate is a mixture between a fixed rate 
          and a variable rate. The interest rate is guaranteed not to rise above 
          a set level within the capped rate period but if the normal variable 
          mortgage rate is below the capped rate then the variable rate is charged. 
          This gives the 'best of both worlds' as the interest rate can fall but 
          will not rise above the capped rate. However, the level at which the 
          cap is fixed is usually higher than for a fixed rate mortgage for a 
          comparable period of time. Sometimes 'Cap and Collar' mortgages are 
          offered and these impose a minimum payment rate ( the collar ) in addition 
          to the maximum rate ( the cap ). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Cash Back</b> - This is the arrangement whereby a cash sum of money 
          is repaid to the borrower at the start of the mortgage. Cash back deals 
          are also available in conjunction with some fixed or discounted rates 
          but the amount of the cash back will normally be reduced in these circumstances. 
          If a large cash back is being considered then it could, in some circumstances, 
          be liable to Capital Gains Tax ( refer to your accountant or local tax 
          office for clarification ). There will normally be early redemption 
          charges if the mortgage is repaid. Early repayment charges vary depending 
          upon the mortgage product being sold. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b>Consumer Credit Act 1974</b> - An act which regulates 
          lending for personal purposes and prescribes statutory safeguards.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Current Account</b> - Another name for an instant access account 
          offering banking facilities such as cheque book , cash card, guarantee 
          card and automated payments (standing orders, direct debits etc). At 
          present the Society has no plans to introduce this type of account. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Conditional Insurance</b> - This refers to insurance products which 
          some lenders will impose as a condition of their mortgage offer. This 
          could mean that the lender insists that accident, sickness and unemployment 
          cover is taken out or that combined buildings and contents insurance 
          is taken, or on their own. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>County Court Judgement (CCJ)</b> - A judgement for debt recorded 
          at a County Court. These judgements will be shown when the lender carries 
          out a credit search. If the debt has been repaid, subsequent to the 
          judgement being recorded, then the entry will be marked 'satisfied'. 
          The appearance of CCJ's on the credit register will greatly reduce mortgage 
          options and nearly all lenders will insist that they are satisfied before 
          considering an application. Even with the judgement(s) satisfied few 
          lenders are prepared to consider lending other than for the most minor 
          judgements. </font></p>

          <font color="#3e3e7b"><b>D</b> <a name="D"></a></font></font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b>Daily Interest</b> - Interest is calculated on the 
          balance of the account at the end of each day. Interest is then accrued 
          daily and added to the account balance on the last day of every month. 
          This means every cleared payment that is made reduces the mortgage balance 
          and interest is recalculated on the reduced balance.</font></p>

          want to find out more about daily interest and how much you could save 
          by taking a mortgage that is calculated on daily interest rather than 
          annual interest <a href="../mortgage/diguide_new.htm">click here</a>.</p>
        <p><font size="2"> <b>Discounted Rate</b> - The lender agrees to give 
          a fixed discount off the normal variable rate for a guaranteed period 
          of time. The discounted rate will move up and down with the normal variable 
          rate but the payment rate will retain the agreed differential below 
          the variable rate for the agreed period of time. If a discounted rate 
          is taken the lender will normally impose early redemption charges if 
          the mortgage is repaid. Early repayment charges vary depending upon 
          the mortgage product being sold. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>

        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Endowment Mortgage</b> - An interest only mortgage supported by an 
          endowment policy. During the term of the mortgage only interest on the 
          mortgage is paid to the lender. At the same time premiums are paid into 
          an endowment policy which should mature at the end of the mortgage term. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Escalating</b> - Interest rate that increases during the term of 
          the account, on defined dates and by agreed amounts. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Exchange of Contracts</b> (NOT SCOTLAND) - This is the stage in the 
          property transaction at which legally binding contracts are exchanged 
          between the buyer and the seller. Once contracts are exchanged the vendor 
          becomes legally obliged to sell and the purchaser to buy on the terms 
          agreed. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Existing Liabilities</b> - This term is used by lenders to define 
          all other finance commitments apart from the existing mortgage. This 
          will take into account such items as bank loans, HP, credit cards, maintenance 
          payments( to ex-spouse ) etc. Most lenders will take these items into 
          account when assessing how much they are prepared to lend and will usually 
          deduct 12 months payments from gross annual income before applying their 
          normal income multipliers. </font></p>

          <b>First Tessa</b> - The first Tessa account a customer opened , with 
          a maximum first year investment of &pound;3000. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>First Time Buyers (FTB)</b> - lenders differ in their definition 
          of a First Time Buyer. Some lenders will include in this someone who 
          has owned a property before but has no property to sell (i.e. may be 
          renting temporarily after selling ) and other lenders will include joint 
          borrowers where just one party is a FTB. Other lenders will take a more 
          literal definition and only include someone who has never owned a property 
          before. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Fixed Rate</b> - The lender will fix the interest rate that they 
          charge at a set level for a fixed period of time. There are normally 
          a whole range of fixed rate products available which vary in terms from 
          very short periods (3 - 6 months ) up to the whole 25 year mortgage 
          term. The lender will normally charge early redemption charges if the 
          mortgage is repaid. Early repayment charges vary depending upon the 
          mortgage product being sold. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Fixed Interest Rate</b> - The account holder receives a pre-determined 
          and unchanging rate of interest , usually on a bond or term account 
          , giving the investor a known return for his capital deposit. The rate 
          will not change even if general base rates change. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Follow-on Tessa</b> - A subsequent Tessa , reinvesting the capital 
          only from an original or first Tessa. This must be done within six months 
          of the first Tessa maturing. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Freehold</b> (NOT SCOTLAND) - This describes the tenure of a property 
          where ownership of the property and land is held indefinitely. This 
          compares with leasehold property where the property is held for a limited 
          period of time. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Further Advance</b> - This is an additional loan made by the existing 
          mortgage lender and secured by the first charge on the property. The 
          Further Advance can be used for a variety of purposes ( subject to the 
          lenders approval ) such as home improvement, purchase of freehold or 
          purchasing a partners share of the equity in your home. </font></p>

        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Gross Interest</b> - The contractual rate of interest without or 
          before the deduction of any income tax liability. If interest is received 
          gross the investor takes the responsibility for discharging any tax 
          liability due to the Inland Revenue. However the interest will generally 
          be paid net unless a registration form is completed to comply with Inland 
          Revenue regulations. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Gross Monthly Payment</b> - This is the monthly mortgage payment. 
          This figure will be shown on the mortgage offer and will represent the 
          actual payment to be made. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Guarantor</b> - A guarantor is a person other than the borrower who 
          guarantees the mortgage repayments. A Guarantor can sometimes be used 
          to support a borrower who has insufficient income to qualify for a mortgage 
          in their own right. The Guarantor will normally need to have sufficient 
          income to support the new mortgage in its entirety after taking into 
          account any existing mortgage and other commitments they have personally. 
          The Guarantor becomes responsible for the whole mortgage debt if the 
          borrower defaults. </font></p>

          <b>Higher Rate of Tax</b> - Currently the highest rate of UK income 
          tax. Not charged by the Society as we deduct tax under the lower rate 
          of tax (currently 20%). </font></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b>Home Buyers Report </b>- A type of survey report 
          which is more detailed than a Mortgage Valuation but not as in depth 
          as a Full Structural Survey. A Home Buyers Report is often carried out 
          by the proposed lenders surveyor and the report can then be used for 
          the lender to replace the Mortgage Valuation in addition to acting as 
          a detailed report for the borrower. A Home Buyers report may not be 
          suitable for certain types of property where a Structural Survey may 
          be more relevant. If in doubt talk to the surveyor you propose to use. 
          </font></p>

        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Incentive rate </b>- A rate of interest charged for an initial period 
          to attract business to the provider . Typically this might be a lower 
          APR on credit cards for the first six months if existing balances are 
          transferred to them. After the incentive period the rates will revert 
          to the normal rates prevailing at that time. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Income Multiplier</b> - Income Multipliers are used as one calculation 
          in determining how much mortgage lenders are prepared to lend on mortgage. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Individual Savings Accounts</b> - Started on April 6th, 1999 and 
          replaced PEP's and TESSA's. Guaranteed to run for at least 10 years, 
          although it will be reviewed after seven years and changes may be made 
          to the terms after the initial ten year period has expired. There will 
          be a maximum investment allowed of &pound;5000 per annum, of which &pound;1000 
          can be put into life assurance and &pound;1000 into cash ( including 
          National Savings). This annual limit will be raised to &pound;7000 for 
          the first year only - and up to &pound;3000 will be allowed to be held 
          in cash. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          In the budget on March 22nd, 2000 the Chancellor announced that for 
          the tax year 2000 - 2001 the investment limits would remain at the original 
          level of &pound;7000 and not be reduced as originally stated to &pound;5000. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Initial Interest</b> - This figure is usually shown on the mortgage 
          completion statement and refers to the amount of interest charged from 
          the date that the funds are drawn down to the first repayment date. 
          This has the effect of increasing the first mortgage payment and the 
          amount of the initial interest payable will depend on the time in the 
          month when the mortgage is completed. . </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Inland Revenue</b> - Government department responsible for assessment

          <b>Interest Rate</b> - The amount paid on the money deposited or the 
          price paid for borrowing money. The way it is debited or credited will 
          vary but the rate will usually be linked directly or indirectly to base 
          rates. </font></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b>Investment limit </b>- The maximum amount that can 
          be credited to an individual account. Usually if the limit is shown 
          as &pound;250,000 for example , this would be per person so that a joint 
          account could attract up to &pound;500,000. However this may not be 
          the case for limited issue accounts. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b><br>
          Investor's Compensation Scheme</b> - This scheme is devised to protect 
          private investors from loss as a result of the collapse of an investment 
          company. However there is a limit to the amount an individual can register 
          their claim for. The first &pound;20000 is protected by 90%, giving 
          a maximum compensation of &pound;18,000 no matter how much is invested 
          with one provider. </font></p>

          <b>Interest Only Mortgage</b> - Interest only mortgages have become 
          increasingly popular in recent years. Interest only mortgages can be 
          supported by an endowment policy, pension plan or Pep in which case 
          they are normally referred to as an endowment, pension or Pep mortgage. 
          An interest only mortgage may, however, be arranged without the support 
          of any particular repayment vehicle. Many lenders will now accept payment 
          of interest only on the basis that the borrower makes their own arrangements 
          to repay the capital at or before the end of the mortgage term. This 
          could be done in a number of ways such as inheritance, sale of the property 
          or from the realisation of other assets. </font></p>

          <b>Land Registry Fee</b> - This is a fee charged by the Land Registry 
          to record a change in the registered title of Registered Land. The change 
          will normally be notified to the Land Registry by the solicitor acting 
          in the house purchase (or Remortgage ) and as such the Land Registry 
          fee will normally be payable to the solicitor and accounted for in his 
          final account. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Leasehold</b> (NOT SCOTLAND) - This is the tenure that applies to 
          most flats and maisonettes in the UK (excluding Scotland). As opposed 
          to freehold property the rights to the property are owned only for a 
          fixed period of time, with the freehold being held by a third party. 
          The lease outlines the responsibilities of the various lessees in a 
          block and determines the arrangements to be adopted for such things 
          as upkeep of the common areas and insurance of the property. Because 
          these cross covenants are required to avoid disagreements and confusion 
          between the lessees only leasehold flats and maisonettes are mortgagable. 
          This should not be confused with the situation where the freehold is 
          owned by all the lessees in a block and this will commonly be advertised 
          as 'share of freehold'. Providing individual leases exist for each lessee 
          then this would normally be acceptable to mortgage lenders. If in any 
          doubt always take legal advice before proceeding. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Legal Completion</b> - This refers to the time at which the legal 
          ownership of the property changes hands. This date will usually be agreed 
          upon at exchange of contracts. This will also be the date at which the 
          mortgage becomes effective ( sometimes the mortgage completion date 
          may be a couple of days before this to ensure that the solicitor has 
          funds on the due day). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>LIBOR Linked Rate </b>- LIBOR is the London Inter Bank Offered Rate 
          and is the rate at which banks lend money to each other. LIBOR changes 
          daily and a LIBOR linked mortgage will normally be adjusted every three 
          months. LIBOR linked rates are usually quoted as X% above LIBOR. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b><a name="ltv"></a>Loan to Value (LTV)</b> - The loan to value is 
          expressed as a percentage and represents the relationship between the 
          size of the mortgage and the value of the property. For example a mortgage 
          of &pound;30,000 on a property valued at &pound;40,000 would be shown 
          as 75% LTV. This is an important figure to look at when considering 
          the various mortgage options as the higher the LTV required the fewer 
          the options. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Lower rate of Tax</b> - Variable. Currently set at 20%. This is the 
          rate at which the Society deducts tax from investment interest. </font></p>

          instant access account. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Minimum balance</b> - This indicates the minimum initial investment 
          acceptable to the account. Some accounts may allow the balance to fall 
          below this once it is operational. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Monthly Payment</b> - This figure will be shown on both the mortgage 
          offer and mortgage completion statement and shows the actual amount 
          of the mortgage payment you will pay. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Mortgage Term</b> - This is the number of years over which the mortgage 
          is arranged. If a capital and interest mortgage is being considered 
          then it is worth looking at shorter terms than the traditional 25 year 
          mortgage as considerable interest savings can be made by reducing the 
          mortgage term by even a couple of years. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Mortgage Valuation</b> - This is the most basic form of survey and 
          is the minimum required by lenders in order to ascertain the suitability 
          of the property as security for their loan. Although the borrower will 
          normally receive a copy of this report it should not be relied upon 
          as a comprehensive report on the condition of the property. A more detailed 
          report (either a Home Buyers Report or Structural Survey) should be 
          commissioned when considering the purchase of a property. </font></p>

          rate less 20%. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Nonrefundable / Not reclaimable</b> - Tax status of account where 
          interest is paid net of basic rate tax but the tax cannot be reclaimed 
          by non-taxpayers. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>No Notice Account </b>- An account where withdrawals may be requested 
          without having to give a notice period but where the receipt of funds 
          may be delayed due to the nature of the account i.e. postal and telephone 
          operated accounts which rely on the post or bank transfer system to 
          deliver the funds after a withdrawal request is made. This title is 
          used to separate these accounts from Instant Access accounts which again 
          do not require any notice on withdrawal but the funds can be received 
          on demand at a branch or cash machine. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Notice</b> - Period of written notification that needs to be given

          earlier access with an interest penalty. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Negative Equity</b> - Appeared in the late 80's as a result of the

          insurance (sometimes referred to as A.S.R. - accident, sickness and 
          redundancy insurance ). This is an insurance policy which is taken out 
          by the borrower and protects against the borrower being unable to work 
          for these reasons. The policy will usually pay a percentage of the normal 
          monthly mortgage repayment (plus insurance) if the borrower is unable 
          to work due to accident / sickness or unemployment / redundancy. These 
          payments will normally only be made for a limited period of time - typically 
          6/12 months or until the borrower returns to work. The terms of these 
          policies and the cost vary considerably from company to company. </font></p>

          to enable instructions to be given via the telephone or fax. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b><a name="portable"></a>Portable</b> - This describes the ability 
          to move a particular mortgage product from one property to another in 
          the event of a property move. This is particularly important if a fixed, 
          capped, cash back or discounted product is taken where early redemption 
          charges are levied. If the product is not 'portable' then a house move 
          would involve the payment of early redemption charges even if another 
          mortgage was taken with the same lender. A portable mortgage means that 
          the same scheme is transferred to the new mortgage for the remainder 
          of the original term e.g. a 5 year fixed rate is taken which has redemption 
          charges within the first five years. If the borrower decides to move 
          after two years then the same five year rate will apply to the new mortgage 
          for the balance of the remaining three years. If the original product 
          was not portable, however, then redemption charges would be paid on 
          redemption of the existing mortgage and a new product would have to 
          be taken for the new mortgage. </font></p>

          <b>Redemption Charge</b> - An additional charge made by the lender if 
          the mortgage is repaid within a pre-agreed period of time. These have 
          become increasingly common with the growth in fixed rate and heavily 
          discounted products. They are generally applied to compensate the Society 
          for the costs incurred in arranging the fixed rate or discounted mortgage 
          schemes. The costs are spread over the term of the initial fixed rate 
          or discount period and are recovered over the period of the fix or discount.Normally 
          expressed as a number of months interest within a set period of years 
          i.e. 6 months interest if redeemed within the first seven years but 
          may also be expressed as a percentage of the mortgage debt i.e. 5% of 
          the mortgage if redeemed within the first seven years. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Remortgage</b> - This is the process by which a mortgage on a property 
          is moved from one lender to another. The new mortgage is used to repay 
          the existing lender and at the same time additional funds may be raised 
          for other purposes. Remortgaging has become an increasingly popular 
          way to take advantage of the competitive deals offered by lenders to 
          attract new business. If a Remortgage is being considered then careful 
          attention should be paid to the costs associated with arranging the 
          Remortgage as well as the savings to be made on the monthly repayment 
          ( the costs can sometimes erode any savings to be made ). A check should 
          also be made with the existing lender to ensure that there are no early 
          redemption charges. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b><br>
          Repayment Mortgage</b> - Also called an Annuity mortgage or Capital 
          and Interest mortgage. With this type of mortgage the monthly repayment 
          includes an element of the capital sum borrowed in addition to the interest 
          charged. In the early years of the mortgage the majority of the monthly 
          repayment consists of interest with only a small part repaying the capital. 
          However, as the debt gradually reduces the element of capital increases 
          and the interest element reduces, so although the monthly repayment 
          stays the same ( assuming interest rate remain unaltered ) the debt 
          starts to reduce more quickly as the term of the mortgage progresses. 
          On a 25 year term mortgage it would not be unusual to still owe over 
          50% of the original debt after the first 15 years. Providing the correct 
          monthly repayments are made on their due dates this mortgage will guarantee 
          to repay the total mortgage debt at the end of the mortgage term. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><br>
          <b>Retention</b> - This relates to monies withheld by lenders until

        <p><font size="2">The appropriate rate is paid on the whole purchase price 
          and not just the excess applying to that band i.e. a purchase price 
          of &pound;350,000 will attract &pound;10500 stamp duty, being 3% of 
          &pound;350,000. The above rates were announced on March 22nd, 2000 by 
          the Chancellor in his budget speech. </font></p>

          report normally undertaken in connection with a House Purchase. If a 
          Structural survey is opted for then the lender will also need to have 
          a mortgage valuation carried out for their own purposes and the borrower 
          will be responsible for both fees. An alternative may be a Home Buyers 
          Report which will cover both the borrower and the lender but advice 
          should be taken from a qualified surveyor who will be able to advise

          common types of this insurance are Mortgage Protection or Level Term 
          Assurance. Mortgage protection is normally used in connection with a 
          capital and interest mortgage and the level of the insured cover reduces 
          in line with the reduction in the mortgage debt. Level Term assurance 
          is more likely to be used in connection with an interest only mortgage 
          as the level of cover remains constant as does the mortgage debt. With 
          Term Assurance cover there is no payout if the policyholder survives 
          the policy term and the policy simply lapses with no value. This factor 
          makes this type of cover relatively inexpensive. </font></p>

          <b>Variable Rate</b> - This is the traditional way that mortgages were 
          arranged before the concept of fixed rates. A variable rate will fluctuate 
          up and down to reflect the true cost of borrowing. Some variable rates 
          may be discounted for a period of time. </font></p>
