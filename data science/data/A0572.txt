accounts on-line or apply on-line for an account. The secure areas of the website can be
identified by the address in the top of your browser. An encrypted area's address will
begin <b>https://</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;rather than the usual <b>http://</b> .<br>
<br>
<b>e-banking service&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br>
Our e-banking service operates from secure systems within Abbey National and because you
are accessing your accounts remotely we have added extra layers of security for your added
peace of mind.<br>
<br>
Prior to entering your logon credentials we take you to a secure part of our computer
system. Subsequent messages sent to and from this system are protected by 128-bit SSL
(Secure Socket Layer) technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;We recommend that you update your browser's
cipher strength to 128-bit SSL. This should prevent any problems caused when viewing
secure sites. If you have any questions about this please contact our technical support
line on <span class="bodytext"><b>0845 600 4388</b></span>, which is open from 7am until 11pm, seven days a week.<br>
<br>
In order to access your accounts we require 3 pieces of information from you to verify
that you are authorised to view the account details. Firstly your card number is required,
secondly a passcode is needed and finally a registration number. Only once all three parts
of the data are confirmed as being correctly entered will we allow access to the accounts
system.<br>
<br>
In addition, we have introduced a <a href="atwork/atwork_peace_mind_guarantee.htm" class="smLink">'Peace of Mind Guarantee'</a>. When using the Abbey National On-line Services we will cover any losses from fraud -
guaranteed. Just as long as you have taken the necessary safeguards to keep your passcode
and registration number secret and haven't deliberately involved yourself in fraud. <br>
<br>
All our on-line transactional services are protected by 'firewalls'. This technology
monitors &amp; prevents any unauthorised access to our back-end systems ensuring that all
your account/personal details cannot be accessed by 'hackers'.<br>
<br>
<b>e-mortgage service</b><br>
Our e-mortgage service uses the same levels of security as our e-banking service to
protect your privacy and ensure your security on-line (see the 'e-banking service' section
above). <br>
<br>
The identity of customers using the Abbey National e-mortgage service is confirmed through
the dual use of a passcode and registration number, which have been designed in accordance
with financial industry standards and best practice.<br>
<br>
All information passed between Abbey National and customers using the e-mortgage service
is sent using strong industry standard encryption technology.<br>
<br>
When filling in your contact details within our e-mortgage service we ask for your e-mail
address so that we can occasionally send you information about accounts and services which
we think would be of interest to you. If you would prefer that we did not use your e-mail
address in this way you can opt out by using the tick box situated there.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>

let us remove you from our list.<br>

strong protective measures and is encrypted using 128-bit SSL technology when you submit
your application. Once the form is received, it is stored on our secure servers and
processed using our normal internal computer systems.<br>

details to a recognised credit reference agency to help process your application.<br>
<br>

on-line form, we will tell you how your information will be used in our data protection
statement and in the relevant terms and conditions. You will be asked to confirm that you
have read and understood these before your application can proceed. <br>
