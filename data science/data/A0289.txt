It is perfect for people who want to get the most from their money but cannot afford to lock it away for long periods of time.  The relatively short ‘no-access’ period and low minimum investment will open up greater returns to more people – not just those financially secure enough to opt for fixed term accounts over a longer period.”<br><br>-Ends-</td></tr><tr><td align='right'><b><a href='story.asp?id=297 '>Read the full story here</a></b><hr></TD></TR><TR><TD><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=20 WIDTH='100%' CELLSPACING=0 ALIGN='center' BORDER=1><TD VALIGN='top' WIDTH='50%'><p align='left'>26/06/2002</p><h3>MONEY MANAGEMENT IS “SINGLE” PRIORITY</h3><p class='justify'><font size=2><B>Calls for more financial advice to help single parent families save money for the future could rise today as research conducted by Birmingham Midshires reveals that nearly one in two single parent families (48%) claim to have no money left at the end of each month.
