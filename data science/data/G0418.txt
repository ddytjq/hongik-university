Determinations of the motion of the sun with respect to the
extra-galactic nebulae have involved a term of several hundred
kilometers which appears to be variable.  Explanations of this paradox
have been sought in a correlation between apparent radial velocities
and distances, but so far the results have not been convincing. The
present paper is a re-examination of the question, based on only those
nebular distances which are believed to be fairly reliable.
<p>

Distances of extra-galactic nebulae depend ultimately upon the
application of absolute-luminosity criteria to involved stars whose
types can be recognized. These include, among others, Cepheid
variables, novae, and blue stars involved in emission nebulosity.
Numerical values depend upon the zero point of the period-luminosity
relation among Cepheids, the other criteria merely check the order of
the distances.  This method is restricted to the few nebulae which are
well resolved by existing instruments. A study of these nebulae,
together with those in which any stars at all can be recognized,
indicates the probability of an approximately uniform upper limit to
the absolute luminosity of stars, in the late-type spirals and
irregular nebulae at least, of the order of (photographic) = -6.3.[1]
The apparent luminosities of the brightest stars in such nebulae are
thus criteria which, although rough and to be applied with caution,
furnish reasonable estimates of the distances of all extra-galactic
systems in which even a few stars can be detected.

Finally, the nebulae themselves appear to be of a definite order of
absolute luminosity, exhibiting a range of four or five magnitudes
about an average value M (visual) = - 15.2.[1] The application of
this statistical average to individual cases can rarely be used to
advantage, but where considerable numbers are involved, and especially
in the various clusters of nebulae, mean apparent luminosities of the
nebulae themselves offer reliable estimates of the mean distances.
<p>

Radial velocities of 46 extra-galactic nebulae are now available, but
individual distances are estimated by only 24. For one other, N. G. C.
3521, an estimate could probably be made, but no photographs are
available at Mount Wilson. The data are given in table 1. The first
seven distances are the most reliable, depending, except for M 32 athe
companion of M 31, upon extensive investigations of many stars
involved.  The next thirteen distances, depending upon the criterion of
a uniform upper limit of stellar luminosity, are subject to
considerable probable errors but are believed to be the most reasonable
values at present available. The last four objects appear to be in the
Virgo Cluster. The distance assigned to the cluster, 2 x 10[6] parsecs,
is derived from the distribution of nebular luminosities, together with
luminosities of stars in some of the later-type spirals, and differs
somewhat from the Harvard estimate of ten million light years.[2]
<p>

The data in the table indicate a linear correlation between distances
and velocities, whether the latter are used directly or corrected for
solar motion, according to the older solutions. This suggests a new
solution for the solar motion in which the distances are introduced as
coefficients of the K term, i. e., the velocities are assumed to vary
directly with the distances, and hense K represents the velocity at
unit distance due to this effect. The equations of condition then take
the form
<p>

<i>rK</i> + <i>X</i>cos(alpha)cos(delta) + <i>Y</i> sin(alpha)cos(delta)+
<i>Z</i>sin(delta)  = <i>v</i>.<p>
<p>


Two solutions have been made, one using the 24 nebulae individually,
the other combining them into 9 groups according to proximity in
direction and in distance.  The results are
<p>
<pre>

                    24 objects          9 groups

          X          - 65 +/- 50         +3 +/- 70
          Y          +226 +/- 95       +230 +/-120
          Z          -195 +/- 40       -133 +/- 70
          K          +465 +/- 50       +513 +/-  60 km./sec. per 10[6] parsecs.

          A           286deg.           269deg.
          D           +40deg.           +33deg.
          Vo          306 km./sec.      247 km./sec.
</pre>
<p>

For such scanty material, so poorly distributed, the results are fairly
definite.  Differences between the two solutions are due largely to the
four Virgo nebulae, which, being the most distant objects and all
sharing the peculiar motion of the cluster, unduly influence the value
of K and hence of Vo. New data on more distant objects will be required
to reduce the effect of such peculiar motion. Meanwhile round numbers,
intermediate between the two solutions, will represent the probably
order of the values. For instance, let A = 277deg. , D = +36deg. (Gal. long. =
32deg. , lat. = +18deg. ), Vo = 280 km./sec., K = +500 km./sec. per million
parsecs. Mr. Stromberg has very kindly checked the general order of
these values by independent solutions for different groupings of the
data.
<p>

A constant term, introduced into the equations, was found to be small
and negative.  This seems to dispose of the necessity for the old
constant K term. Solutions of this sort have been published by
Lundmark,[3] who replaced the old K by k + lr + mr[2].  His favored
solution gave k = 513, as against the former value of the order of 700,
and hence offered little advantage.

</pre>

The residuals for the two solutions given above average
150 and 110 km./sec.
and should represent the average peculiar motions of the
individual nebulae and of the groups, respectively. In order to exhibit
the results in a graphical form, the solar motion has been eliminated
from the obsrved velocities and the remainders, the distance terms plus
the residuals, have been plotted against the distances. The run of the
residuals is about as smooth as can be expected, and in general the
form of the solutions appears to be adequate.
<p>

The 22 nebulae for which distances are not available can be treated in
two ways.  First, the mean distance of the group derived from the mean
apparent magnitudes can be compared with the mean of the velocities
corrected for solar motion. The result, 745 km./sec. for a distance of
1.4 x 10[6] parsecs, falls between the two previous solutions and
indicates a value for K of 530 as against the proposed value, 500
km./sec.
<p>

Secondly, the scatter of the individual nebulae can be examined by
assuming the relation between distances and velocities as previously
determined. Distances can then be calculated from the velocities
corrected for solar motion, and absolute magnitudes can be derived from
the apparent magnitudes. The results are given in table 2 and may be
compared with the distribution of absolute magnitudes among the nebulae
in table 1, whose distances are derived from other criteria.
N. G. C. 404
can be excluded, since the observed velocity is so small that the
peculiar
motion must be large in comparison with the distance effect. The object
is not necessarily an exception, however, since a distance can be
assigned for which the peculiar motion and the absolute magnitude are
both within the range previously determined. The two mean magnitudes,
-15.3 and -15.5, the ranges, 4.9 and 5.0 mag., and the
frequency distributions are closely similar for these two entirely
independent sets of data; and even the slight difference in mean
magnitudes can be attributed to the selected, very bright, nebulae in
the Virgo Cluster. This entirely unforced agreement supports the
validity of the velocity-distance relation in a very evident matter.
Finally, it is worth recording that the frequency distribution of
absolute magnitudes in the two tables combined is comparable with those
found in the various clusters of nebulae.

<p>
<p>

The results establish a roughly linear relation between velocities and
distances among nebulae for which velocities have been previously
published, and the relation appears to dominate the distribution of
velocities. In order to investigate the matter on a much larger scale,
Mr. Humason at Mount Wilson has initiated a program of determining
velocities of the most distant nebulae that can be observed with
confidence. These, naturally, are the brightest nebulae in clusters of
nebulae. The first definite result,[4] v = + 3779 km./sec. for
N. G. C.  7619,
is thoroughly consistenct with the present conclusions. Corrected
for the solar motion, this velocity is +3910, which, with K = 500,
corresponds to a distance of 7.8 x 10[6] parsecs. Since the apparent
magnitude is 11.8, the absolute magnitude at such a distance is
-17.65, which is of the right order for the brightest nebulae in a
cluster. A preliminary distance, derived independently from the cluster
of which this nebula appears to be a member, is of the order of
7x10[6] parsecs.
<p>

New data to be expected in the near future may modify the significance
of the dpresent investigation or, if confirmatory, will lead to a
solution having many times the weight. For this reason it is thought
premature to discuss in detail the obvious consequences of the present
results. For example, if the solar motion with respect to the clusters
represents the rotation of the galactic system, this motion could be
subtracted from the results for the nebulae and the remainder would
represent the motion of the galactic system with respect to the
extra-galactic nebulae.
<p>

The outstanding feature, however, is the possibility that the
velocity-distance relation may represent the de Sitter effect, and
hence that numerical data may be introduced into discussions of the
general curvature of space. In the de Sitter cosmology, displacements
of the spectra arise from two sources, an apparent slowing down of
atomic vibrations and a general tendency of material particles to
scatter. The latter involves an acceleration and hence introduces the
element of time. The relative importance of these two effects should
determine the form of the relation between distances and observed
velocities; and in this connection it may be emphasized that the linear
relation found in the present discussion is a first approximation
representing a restricted range in distance.
