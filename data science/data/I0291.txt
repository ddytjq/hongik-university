    <td><font SIZE="2">From the summer of 1998, the European Football Association (UEFA) have
    decided to ban all standing room on the terraces, at football grounds holding European
    football ties. Standing during a game is totally banned.<p>If the supporters do not start
    a discussion with the authorities now, it will be inevitable that UEFAs all seater demand
    could be extended to the national leagues of all European countries, as is the case with
    the Premier League in England.</p>
    <p>It is a fact that the implementation of all-seaters stadiums in England together with
    other amenities have enhanced security, but this has dampened the enthusiastic atmosphere
    created by the supporters.</p>
    <p>Football is a trend these years, but someday it will turn. If standing fans are being
    banned, the atmosphere will disappear (as in England), the trendy spectators will
    disappear, souvenir sales will decrease and the question remains; will the real fans still
    be there?</p>
    <p>Most fans agree on this issue and lots of talk is going on, but now it is time for
    ACTION!!!</p>
    <p>Our goal is:<ul>
      <li>We will fight for the possibility to remain standing throughout the game.</li>
      <li>We will fight for the right to have a section of the stands with unnumbered seats or
        terraces, so supporters can stand together with their friends and acquaintances.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will prove, that:<ul>
      <li>Standing fans are an integral part of football.</li>
      <li>That when the enthusiasm and atmosphere disappear the fans will disappear, thus
        effecting the clubs economy.</li>
      <li>Fans have their right to be heard and cannot be ignored if we stand together.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our point for discussion could be:<ul>
      <li>A 100% peaceful protest weekend in the autumn 1998 (5 and 6 September?!) with the
        participation of the fans from ALL European clubs, observing a total silence during the
        first half of a game, and giving full vocal support during the 2nd half.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The action in details (suggestion):</p>
    <p>During the 1st half:<ul>
      <li>All fans will be seated, keeping quiet and will only applause when goals are scored -
        similar to a tennis match. This will be a symbol to how boring football will become in
        future...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>During the 2nd half:<ul>
      <li>All fans will stand up and give full vocal support. This will symbolize how much
        standing and singing supporters mean for football, and be a symbol on how it ought to be.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Distribution:<ul>
      <li>Copies of this letter have been sent through the internet to most those European
        fanclubs. It can also be found on the official home pages, the fanzines, and fanclubs
        sites. </li>
      <li>Rumors spread through the internet, fanzines, pamphlets and verbally.</li>
      <li>This standard letter can be copied and distributed to every football enthusiast you can
        think of.</li>
      <li>We ask you to distribute this letter to every fan you know, who might be interested in
        this protest. The success of the action depends on the interest of supporters. We want all
        clubs in Europe to participate...</li>
