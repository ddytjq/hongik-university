		<P>Important: These Notes and the Consent appearing in Paragraph 2 must be read 
		prior to completing the application form and retained by you to read in 
		conjunction with the Offer of Loan in due course. You should read carefully the 
		application form before completing the Declaration. References in the notes to 
		'our', 'we' and 'us' shall mean Bristol &amp; West plc and references to 'you' 
		shall mean the applicant(s).</P>
			
		<OL>
			<LI><B>Offer of Loan</B>
			<P>When we have decided that a loan may be made we will 
			issue an Offer of Loan. The Offer (including its terms and conditions) forms an 
			integral part of the mortgage and when the Solicitor requests the loan funds, he 
			will confirm that the terms and conditions of the Offer are acceptable to all 
			applicants and any guarantors. It is, therefore, important that all parties to 
			the mortgage check the Offer for correctness and inform the Solicitor that the 
			terms are acceptable. (In Scotland, references to 'mortgage' and 'Mortgage Deed' 
			are to the Standard Security in our favour).</P></LI>
			
			<LI><B>General Consent to Transfer</B>
			<P>This is an important notice which we are required to bring to your attention: 
			<OL type=a>
				<LI>You acknowledge that we have the legal power (incorporated in the mortgage 
				deed) to subsequently transfer the mortgage to another body which may not 
				necessarily be a bank or an associated body of a bank and for the avoidance of 
				doubt, you expressly and irrevocably consent to us exercising such power in our 
				absolute discretion.</LI>
				<LI>Any transfer under this Consent will only be made to a body which adheres to 
				the Statement of Practice relating to the transfer of mortgages drawn up under 
				the auspices of the Department of the Environment and the Treasury and adopted 
				by us (a copy of which is available on request).</LI>
				<LI>Any transfer under this General Consent will only be exercised on the basis 
				that we will retain control of the administration of the mortgage and in 
				particular:</LI>
				<OL type=i>
					<LI>the setting of the mortgage interest rate in line with the provisions of our 
					Mortgage Deed;</LI>
					<LI>the conduct of relations with borrowers including those whose payments are 
					seriously in arrears.</LI>
					<LI>providing our performance is satisfactory we will exercise this control for 
					a minimum of one year.</LI>
					<LI>Any transfer under this General Consent will be on the basis that the 
					transferee may only subsequently transfer the mortgage on the above terms.</LI>
				</OL>
				</LI>
			</OL>
			</P></LI>
			
			<LI><B>Additional Security</B>
			<P>Additional security in the form of a 
			mortgage indemnity policy is required by us where the loan exceeds 85% of the 
			valuation of the property, or the purchase price, whichever is the lower. The 
			mortgage indemnity policy is taken to cover the increased risk to us of making a 
			loan in excess of our normal limits. This type of policy should not be confused 
			with life or other forms of assurance. Its sole purpose is to provide us with 
			additional security. It is not a policy of insurance to protect borrowers 
			against falls in house price or against the consequences of their failure to 
			fulfil their obligations under the mortgage.</P>

			<P><I>Understanding Mortgage Indemnity Insurance</I></P>
			<P>It is sometimes difficult for borrowers to 
			understand the precise nature of mortgage indemnity insurance and how it affects 
			their continuing responsibilities.<BR>The notes below are intended to explain 
			clearly the role played by mortgage indemnity insurance and indicate how it will 
			operate in the event of the borrower's property being repossessed and sold.</P>
			
			<P><I>The Fundamental Principles Of Mortgage Indemnity Insurance</I>
			<UL>
				<LI>It is taken out by us for our own additional security in the event that we 
				have to repossess and sell the property at a loss.</LI>
				<LI>It covers us for our losses on the sale of the property following 
				repossession; it does not cover you.</LI> 
				<LI>Notwithstanding the existence of a mortgage indemnity policy, you are still 
				responsible for repaying all the money borrowed from us under the mortgage.</LI>
				<LI>The cost is met by you in the form of a once only non-refundable fee 
				deducted from the loan funds. Some or all of this fee will be used to obtain 
				mortgage indemnity insurance.</LI> 
				<LI>We will only require you to meet the cost of the policy where we are lending 
				you more than 85% of the property valuation, or the purchase price (whichever is 
				the lower). However, the mortgage indemnity policy will give us cover for the 
				total amount lent in excess of 75% of the property valuation or purchase price 
				and this will be reflected in the cost of the premium.</LI>
				<LI>The benefit to you is that we are willing to lend more with the protection 
				of mortgage indemnity than we could prudently lend without it.</LI>
			</UL></P>
			
			<P><I>How We Can Claim Under The Mortgage Indemnity Policy</I></P>
			<P>The first step for any borrower who is experiencing 
			difficulties in mortgage repayments or who is suffering as a result of negative 
			equity, should be to talk to us; there could be a number of options open to the 
			borrower.<BR>
			However if a borrower falls significantly behind with mortgage 
			repayments and we are obliged to repossess and sell the property, a claim could 
			be made by us under the mortgage indemnity policy. The amount we will seek to 
			claim from the insurer will be based on the difference between the sale price 
			and the amount outstanding on your mortgage - referred to as the 
			'shortfall'.<BR>
			The insurance policy will not always cover all of our losses and 
			in addition, the insurer has the right of 'subrogation' - in other words the 
			insurer, or we on the insurer's behalf, will look to the borrower to re-imburse 
			them for the full amount of the shortfall. Borrowers should remember that under 
			the terms of their mortgage with us they make a personal promise to repay all 
			the money owing under the mortgage. The existence of a mortgage indemnity policy 
			does not alter this obligation.</P>
			
			<P>Remember - borrowers cannot avoid 
			responsibility for repaying all money owed under their mortgage by simply 
			handing the property back to us. Any advice that suggests that a mortgage 
			indemnity policy will mean borrowers do not have to repay any shortfall between 
			the sale price and the amount outstanding on the mortgage, is incorrect. The 
			insurer or we on their behalf, have 12 years in England and Wales and 6 years in 
			Scotland, in which to seek full recovery of the debt from the borrower. In these 
			circumstances a borrower's ability to obtain credit or a mortgage in the future 
			will be severely affected.<BR>
			Never let difficulties in meeting mortgage payments get out of hand - talk to us first.<BR>
			Having explained that mortgage 
			indemnity insurance is for our protection and not the borrower, we are genuinely 
			sympathetic towards borrowers who come and talk to us about any difficulties 
			they are experiencing, as early as possible. There are many ways in which the 
			burden of meeting mortgage repayments can be eased. For example, the period of 
			the mortgage could be altered to reduce the monthly amounts payable. Help may be 
			available from the DSS or the mortgage could be converted to interest only in 
			order to reduce the outgoing. For borrowers who find themselves unable to move 
			home because of negative equity, we have a special mortgage product that could 
			help.
			<BR>Remember if you are experiencing difficulties in meeting your mortgage 
			repayments, talk to us as soon as possible.</P>
			
			<LI><B>Legal and Mortgage Charges</B></LI>
			<P>You may require the services of a 
			solicitor to act in the purchase or remortgage of the property. We recommend 
			that you contact him/her as soon as possible. If your solicitor is on our 
			approved panel of solicitors, he/she may be able to act for us in this 
			transaction. We operate a restricted panel of sole practitioners. If you 
			instruct a sole practitioner, you should check with your branch or 
			administration centre to confirm that he/she may also act for us. You will be 
			responsible for all the legal charges in connection with the mortgage. The 
			Solicitor should be consulted at the outset for an estimate of the total costs 
			involved.<BR>
			We will have the right arising from the mortgage to make 
			administration charges on the happening of certain events and to debit these 
			charges to your account. Details of these charges are set out in our brochure 
			entitled 'A Guide To Mortgage Charges' which can be 
			obtained from your branch or administration centre.<BR>
			NB: Wherever the context 
			allows, 'Solicitor' also includes Licensed Conveyancers who are on our approved 
			panel.</P>
			
			<LI><B>Monthly Payment and Initial Interest</B></LI>
			<P><I>When Monthly Payments Are Due</I><BR>
			Monthly payments are due in advance on the first of each month or 
			any other date in each month which we specify. The first payment that you will 
			be required to make to us will normally be on the 1st of the month following the 
			date on which we make the loan. However, where this date is after the 24th of 
			the month then the first payment due to be made will be on the 1st of the second 
			month after we make the loan.</P>
			
			<P><I>The First Payment and Initial Interest</I><BR>
			The first payment due to us, will be made up of one normal 
			monthly payment (unless funds are advanced after the 24th of the month, in which 
			case two normal monthly payments will be required) together with any interest 
			due from the day the loan is made to the end of the month in which completion 
			takes place. This interest amount is referred to as Initial Interest and is 
			collected in this manner because, in common with the majority of lenders, 
			payment calculations use whole months to calculate the payment due.<BR>
			You need 
			to ensure that you allow for all these amounts after you have received the loan 
			because we will collect this by one single direct debit on the first date due. 
			Thereafter the direct debit will collect the normal monthly payment on the 1st 
			of each following month. For the purpose of charging interest, the date we make 
			the loan means the day after the date of our cheque for the loan, if we pay by 
			cheque, or the day after the date of an electronic transfer of funds, if we pay 
			by transfer. Our normal policy is to pay the loan by 
			cheque.</P>
			<P><I>CONTRACTUAL / ACTUAL REPAYMENTS</I><BR>
			There are two types of payment quoted in your Offer of Loan. The Contractual
			Payment is calculated as a capital and interest payment figure based on the
			current standard variable rate, whereas the Actual Payment takes into account
			any fixed interest rate or interest-only concessions, as stated in our
			Residential Mortgage Conditions.</P>
			
			<LI><B>Leasehold Securities</B></LI>
			<P>Our minimum requirements in respect of leasehold properties are as follows:- 
			<OL type=a>
				<LI><I>Houses and Bungalows</I>
				<OL type=i>
					<LI>The remaining term of the lease must be at least 70 years from the day we 
					make the loan.</LI>
					<LI>The lease must not contain a forfeiture clause upon the bankruptcy of the 
					lessee which would entitle the landlord to terminate the lease.</LI> 
					<LI>If the lease contains a clause which could result in a substantial increase 
					in the ground rent or which is considered unduly onerous, then full details 
					should be referred to us immediately as it could adversely affect the value of 
					the property.</LI> 
					<LI>If you own or are about to own the freehold as well as the leasehold 
					interest in the property, we will require a mortgage over both interests. 
					</LI>
				</OL>
				<LI><I>Flats and Maisonettes</I></LI></BR>
				For Flats and Maisonettes the following requirements must be fulfilled in addition to those above. 
				<OL type=i>
					<LI>The lease must contain provisions giving adequate mutual rights of support.</LI>
					<LI>There must be satisfactory arrangements for maintenance and repair of the 
					common structure, foundations, roof, main walls, common parts and services. In	
					the case of large blocks, maintenance must be affectively controlled by the 
					landlord or a viable management company in which the lessees have an enforceable 
					interest.</LI>
				</OL>
				</LI>
			</OL></P>
			<P>NB. Our Solicitors are required to advise us if 
			these requirements are not satisfied, or if there are any unsatisfactory or 
			unduly onerous provisions in the lease.<BR>
			Where the lease provides for the 
			payment of ground rent, maintenance charges and other outgoings, such payments 
			must be made punctually by you. This is a requirement of your mortgage as well 
			as being an obligation contained in the lease. Failure to comply with this 
			requirement will entitle us to exercise our rights and remedies under the 
			mortgage including the right to debit your mortgage account to pay the lease 
			outgoings. Similar requirements apply in relation to properties held on long 
			leases in Scotland.</P>
			
			<LI><B>Insurance</B></LI>
			<P>Special Mortgage Products<BR>
			There may be certain mortgage products that we offer from time to time that require specific 
			insurance products to be taken out as part of that mortgage. You should refer to 
			your product literature and Offer of Loan if you are unsure in this 
			respect.</P>
			<P>Buildings Insurance<BR>
			We require that all properties mortgaged 
			to us will be insured in our name as well as yours. This can be done in one of 
			several ways:<BR>
			<I>Arranging It Through Us</I><BR>
			We will be pleased to arrange 
			cover for you. This would be arranged on an index linked basis for the amount 
			recommended by the Valuer when he/she values the property.<BR>
			<I>Arranging It Yourself</I><BR>
			Alternatively, you may be entitled to arrange your own insurance 
			cover with an insurance company of your choice subject to the following 
			conditions: 
			<OL>
				<LI>the company and the policy must be approved by us in writing before completion;</LI>
				<LI>we must be jointly insured with you; </LI>
			</OL>
			If you wish to arrange your 
			own insurance you should advise your branch or administration centre when you 
			complete your Application Form. If you arrange your own buildings insurance a fee of £25 
			is payable to Bristol & West to cover additional administration costs.<BR>
			<I>Minimum Cover Required</I><BR>
			The minimum amount of insurance cover required is the full cost of reinstatement i.e. the 
			full rebuilding cost of the property including an appropriate allowance for the 
			cost of demolition, site clearance, surveyor's and legal fees and the extra cost 
			of rebuilding to comply with Local Authority requirements.<BR>
			<I>Leasehold Property</I><BR>
			Leasehold properties where the insurance is controlled by the 
			Landlord, will normally not be insured through our agency. However, we will 
			require full details of the policy to be lodged with us and our interest noted 
			on the original policy.<BR>
			<I>Contents Insurance</I><BR>
			We are able to offer special schemes to cover the household insurance needs of our customers. Further 
			details are available on request from your branch or administration 
			centre.<BR>
			<I>Payment Protection Insurance</I><BR>
			We are also able to offer a 
			scheme to provide cover for your mortgage payments during sickness and 
			redundancy. This product is only available for a period of three months after we 
			make the loan. You will normally pay your premiums by direct debit, once the 
			policy has been set up. A brochure providing full details of the extent of cover 
			and terms and conditions is available from your branch office or administration 
			centre.<BR>
			<I>Payment of Insurance Premium</I><BR>
			Insurance premiums for 
			buildings and/or contents may be paid together with your monthly mortgage 
			payment due on the 1st of each month, if you choose to pay monthly. 
			Alternatively, you may pay annually by direct debit. If, however, you decide to 
			pay monthly, we charge a handling fee of 5% of the premium. You should also be 
			aware that the first insurance premium due, whether it be annually or monthly, 
			will be deducted from the loan funds before the loan is made.<BR>
			As you are committed to purchase upon exchange of contracts (and normally on conclusion of 
			missives in Scotland), it is suggested that the policy/policies are put in force 
			on exchange (or conclusion).</P>
			
			<LI><B>Loan Repayment Methods</B></LI>
			<P>We will allow you to arrange your 
			mortgage on a repayment, endowment, personal pension plan, ISA or (in limited 
			circumstances) an interest only basis. We may require that life or other forms 
			of assurance cover be in force for the full amount owed under the mortgage.<BR>
			Should you require advice, we will be pleased to consider your individual 
			life or other assurance needs and you should contact your local branch or 
			administration centre.<BR>
			If you already have adequate life or other forms of 
			assurance or intend to arrange cover separately, written evidence confirming 
			this will be required by us.<BR>
			We may require a legal assignment of your life policies as a condition of the loan.<BR>
			In all cases, where there are two or 
			more applicants, the policy should be arranged to cover you jointly. As you are 
			committed to purchase upon exchange of contracts (and normally on conclusion of 
			missives in Scotland) it is suggested that the policy/policies are put in force 
			on exchange (or conclusion).<BR>
			It is vitally important that you make and 
			continue to maintain suitable arrangements to repay the loan and not just the 
			interest chargeable on the loan. If you break any term of an agreement with us 
			that you may pay interest only, for example, you fail to maintain a suitable 
			endowment policy taken out to repay the loan), we may give notice: 
			<UL>
				<LI>putting an end to the agreement for payment of interest only;</LI> 
				<LI>specifying a new monthly payment worked out to cover repayment of the loan 
				and any other loan as well as interest by the end of the mortgage period; and</LI> 
				<LI>changing the rate of interest to our standard variable rate, if the interest 
				rate is different.</LI>
			</UL>
			If you do not take out or maintain suitable 
			arrangements to repay the loan we will still require you to repay the full 
			amount owed under the mortgage at the end of the mortgage period even if the 
			maturity value of your chosen policy is not enough to pay off the mortgage. It 
			is your responsibility to ensure that at all times an adequate method is in 
			place to repay the amount owed under the mortgage. We will however, remind you 
			annually of the need to make sure that an adequate repayment method is in place.</P> 

			<LI><B>Charging of Interest</B></LI>
			<P>
			<OL type=a>
				<LI><I>Interest Will Be Charged</I></LI>
				<OL type=i>
					<LI>In the first year on the full amount of any money lent to or becoming owing 
					by you from the date on which it was lent or became owing to the end of the year 
					or to the end of the month in which sums you owe are repaid.</LI> 
					<LI>In any subsequent year on the full amount owed under the mortgage (whether 
					principal, interest or otherwise) on the last date of the preceding year and on 
					any further sum lent to or becoming owing from you during the year as from the 
					date the money was lent or became owing under the mortgage until the end of the 
					year or to the end of the month in which you repay the loan. NB: For the above 
					purpose, the date of the loan is the day after the date of our cheque for the 
					loan, if we pay by cheque or the day after the date of an electronic transfer of 
					funds, if we pay by transfer. A 'year' is the twelve months ended 31st March or 
					such other date as our Board of Directors may from time to time approve. 
					</LI>
				</OL>
				<LI><I>Repayment Mortgages</I></LI></BR>
				The mortgage payment is so calculated that it 
				will repay the total loan and interest within the term quoted in the Offer of 
				Loan, on the assumption that Monthly Payments are made on the due dates. 
				<LI><I>Interest Only Mortgages</I></LI></BR>
				You are required to pay interest only on 
				the loan, the capital being repaid to us upon the maturity of the life assurance 
				policies from your own resources at the end of the mortgage period. The 
				appropriate premium payments must be made by you to the Insurance Company on the 
				due date. We will not wish to receive the policy document. It must be retained 
				safely by you and you should ensure that the correct cover has been provided. 
				Please carefully read Section 9 above. 
				<LI><I>Rate of Interest</I></LI><BR>
				We have the power to vary our Standard Variable 
				Rate as set out in our Residential Mortgage Conditions. Any such change will be 
				communicated to you within twenty-eight days of the decision to change the rate.	
			</OL></P>
			
			<LI><B>Retentions</B>
			<P>We may retain loan funds until such time as the 
			terms and conditions of the Offer of Loan have been complied with. When we 
			require such a retention, interest is charged only on the amount released to you 
			and the monthly payment is also calculated on this figure.<BR>The retention 
			monies will be released to you once we have satisfied ourselves that the 
			necessary works (including unmade roads) as stipulated in your Offer of Loan 
			have been carried out. It may be necessary for the work to be inspected by our 
			valuer and any re-inspection fee will be deducted from the loan funds which will 
			be issued to your Solicitor.<BR>
			In the event of any arrears of interest or 
			monthly payments arising on the loan, we reserve the right to offset the 
			retention monies against any such arrears.</P> 
			
			<LI><B>Redemption charges</B></LI>
			<P><OL type=a>
				<LI>If we issue an Offer of Loan to you, please check it carefully to see if any 
				redemption charges are payable in the event that you pay off the loan or any 
				part of it early</LI> 
				<LI>If the Offer does not contain any redemption charge conditions, you will 
				still be obliged to pay us a fee to cover our reasonable administration costs 
				(which may include a Deeds Release fee) if the loan or any part of it is repaid 
				early. A reasonable administration fee is also payable when the mortgage period 
				comes to an end.</LI> 
				<LI>If you subsequently wish to apply to transfer from one mortgage product to 
				another, we have the right to decline your application. <BR>
				However, if we accept your application, we may insist as a condition of the transfer that you 
				pay us transfer and administration charges. The amount of the transfer charge 
				may be equivalent to the redemption charge set out in your Offer of Loan. 
				</LI>
			</OL></P>
			
			<LI><B>Annual Statement</B></LI>
			<P>An annual statement will be issued to you in 
			April, showing the capital balance outstanding and all transactions made on the 
			account during the previous financial year to 31st March. The statement also 
			shows whether the mortgage payments are in advance or in arrears.</P>
			
			<LI><B>Portability</B></LI>
			<P>From time to time, we offer special mortgage products, 
			a feature of which may be the option to transfer the rate of interest (usually a 
			fixed rate) from one mortgage to another, within a defined time-frame. The fixed 
			interest rate is only transferrable on the outstanding portion of the loan to 
			which the rate was originally applied. Full details are available upon request.</P>
			
			<LI><B>Duties</B></LI>
			<P>By signing the Mortgage Deed you will be agreeing to take 
			on a number of duties. These duties include the obligation to repay any 
			shortfall arising on the sale of the property by us.<BR>
			Full details of these 
			duties are contained within our Residential Mortgage Conditions which will be 
			sent to your Solicitor at the time the Offer of Loan is issued.<BR>
			Your Solicitor should explain these duties to you prior to completion of the 
			mortgage.<BR>
			Failure to observe the duties set out in the conditions entitles us 
			to call in the entire amount owed under the mortgage.</P>
			
			<LI><B>Valuation or Survey?</B></LI>
			<P><I>Mortgage Valuation</I><BR>
			This report is a basic inspection prepared for Bristol &amp; West plc, it answers only 
			Bristol &amp; West's questions concerning the appropriate security for your 
			loan.<BR>
			You cannot rely on it to answer the questions which concern your 
			personal interests and you must obtain a more detailed survey before entering 
			into a legal commitment to purchase. A copy of the report is provided to you for 
			information purposes only.<BR>
			Two forms of survey exist to help home buyers. They are:- 
			<OL type=i>
				<LI><I>The Home Buyer Survey and Valuation</I><BR>
				This report is in a standard 
				format and is designed specifically as an economy service. It is intended only 
				for houses, flats or bungalows which are conventional in type and construction 
				and apparently in reasonable condition. It focuses on essential defects and 
				problems which are urgent or significant and which do have an effect on the 
				value of the property, although it includes much other valuable information. If 
				the surveyor does not consider the property suitable for this type of report, he 
				or she will contact you but will continue with the mortgage valuation inspection 
				instructed by Bristol &amp; West. 
				<LI><I>The Building Survey (formerly called a Structural Survey)</I><BR>This 
				report is suitable for all residential properties and provides a full picture of 
				their construction and condition. It is likely to be needed if the property is, 
				for example, of unusual construction, is dilapidated or has been extensively 
				altered or where a major conversion or renovation is planned. It is usually 
				tailored to your individual requirements. Report includes extensive technical 
				information on construction and materials, as well as details of the whole range 
				of defects, major to minor. </LI>
			</OL>
			Our fee scale for the Mortgage Valuation 
			and Home Buyer reports is listed in a separate leaflet (Your Guide to Mortgage 
			Charges - MO313). There are no standard fees for a Building Survey and it is 
			important that you agree, both a fee and Conditions of Engagement before 
			proceeding if it is your intention to instruct a Building Survey. Bristol &amp; 
			West plc will still require a Mortgage Valuation Report if you chose a Home 
			Buyer Report or Building Survey. It may be possible for a Building Survey to be 
			carried out by the Surveyor whom we instruct to carry out the Mortgage Valuation 
			Report, with some saving in overall costs. If you chose this option, you must 
			instruct the Surveyor yourself in respect of the Building Survey element. It is 
			vital that the Surveyor obtains your precise instructions within the Terms of 
			Engagement before inspecting the property, in order to avoid separate visits.</P>
			
			<LI><B>Guarantors</B></LI>
			<P>Where we decide to accept someone as guarantor then by 
			signing the mortgage deed that the guarantor may become liable instead of, or as 
			well as, the borrower whose debt to us he/she is guaranteeing. The guarantor's 
			liability to us will be limited to the amount of the original loan we make to 
			the borrower, any further loans made to the borrower with the guarantor's 
			written consent and interest and costs as provided in our Residential Mortgage 
			Conditions. The guarantor should receive independent legal advice before signing 
			the mortgage deed.</P>
