<h1>The very small quantum mechanics bit (part 1)</h1>
Pretty odd, isn't it?  First I tell you that nothing can leave a <a
href="static.html">static black hole</a> once it has passed the event horizon, but now I say that
sometimes it can!  I think most of quantum mechanics seems contradictory.
While classical physics said protons and electrons and all of those funky
little particles could be visualized like little marbles rolling around 3D
tracks.  Quantum mechanics says it will have none of this!  Those
particles are more like groups of waves than little balls of matter.  This
fit in with an experimentally-proven idea called the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle, that it was impossible to predict with absolute
certainty a particle's location, just give probabilities of where it
<i>could</i> be.  The wave-packet view incorporates this uncertainty,
while the marbles-in-tracks does not.  Chalk one up for quantum mechanics.
Realize, I understood very little of what I just said; I'm just repeating
what I've read.
<p>
Turns out that this probability thing is also important in electrical
circuit devices like diodes.  A diode creates a wall, a potential barrier,
so no electricity can flow in certain instances.  However, quantum
mechanics predicts that there is <i>some</i> probability that
particle-waves can get through.  Guess what---electrons do get through
this barrier, even though classical mechanics says they can't!  What does
this have to do with static black holes??  The gravity field of the black
hole can be thought of as a potential barrier preventing stuff from
leaving. For large black holes that barrier is so thick that the
probability of something getting through is pretty much zero.  But, but
,but---for small black holes that barrier is very thin!  In 1975 Hawking
proved that particles can be created within the event horizon and escape
to the outside world! Well, they say he proved it. I take their word for
it, for I suspect the proof would take more math skills than I currently
have to understand.
