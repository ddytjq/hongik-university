                You guys took control of the race with about three laps to go.<br>
                </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A: 
                Well, Coach [John McDonnell] told us to just sit back and let 
                them do the work until there was not more than 800m to go, that 
                we should just race and let them take the pace. I guess I didn't 
                see Coach make the signal, but Daniel [Lincoln] may have and he 
                just went all or nothing. He broke away by five or six meters. 
                It helped me; I tried to to take the lead, to help Daniel along, 
                but I was so worried about myself that I wasn't much help. I stayed 
                down coming into the last lap, trying my legs out, and then just 
                started banging away. Daniel and Jason [Sandfort] started picking 
                up the shrapnel. It was fun.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366">Q: 
                Are you surprised that Lincoln didn't take second?</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
                </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A: 
                Well, I knew Torres and Ritzenhein are running the World Championships 
                in two weeks for the U.S., so they're in pretty good shape. We 
                hoped for 1-2, at least for the opportunity, but we didn't really 
                think it was actually going to happen. I mean, there were too 
                many good guys who could come in between us. The big surprise 
                was Jason Sandfort. If he scored, he scored, if he didn't, he 
                didn't, and coming in fifth place, he should have the whole team 
                fired up.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366">Q: 
                You were in between Torres and Ritzenhein in cross-country. Have 
                you been training with them in mind?</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
                </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A: 
                Kind of. Track season, Colorado doesn't really work for it. They're 
                pretty much a specialized cross-country training program. Seeing 
                them qualify last week was a surprise, but I knew they were there 
                to compete for the win. I think we had the edge, with more speed, 
                but I thought we could have them. The real surprise was Ryan Shay.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366">Q: 
                Was Shay trying to set up a fast pace?</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
                </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A: 
                I think he wanted to put up a fast pace, to try and neutralize 
                my kick. He put on more speed than most people out there, this 
                time of season, it's the only way you're going to do it. Unfortunately 
                you have to do all the work, and no one helps you.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366">Q: 
                He may have been looking for the same kind of race he ran to win 
                the outdoor 10,000 last spring.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
                </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A: 
                I was watching Murray Link during the race, and he was pointing 
                at Ryan Shay the whole way. He was standing next to coach McDonnell; 
                it's his first time back in Arkansas, since outdoors. He wanted 
                one of us to get Shay for him. But I was thinking about the two 
                Colorado guys.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366">Q: 
                Is this race going to happen all over again at the outdoor meet?</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
                A: I hope so. I hope outdoor season is better, even. Daniel's 
                going to go to the steeplechase, of course. I don't know the plans, 
                yet, but maybe I'll double, the 1,500 and the 5,000, or the 5,000 
                and the 10,000, depending on the shape I'm in. But the 5k is the 
                big one. I've got the 3k tomorrow, everyone's meeting in that 
                one, it's going to be quick and rough. I've been concentrating 
                on the 5k all week. I haven't been thinking about the 3k, just 
                putting it in the back of my mind and racing the race that's coming, 
                and let it take care of itself. I don't know who will be fresh 
                for that race. I need to get my legs back.</font></p>

                A: 
                I'm a senior, so this was my last indoor race. I'll concentrate

                made him run a 3:55 for his relay. The plan was to be comfortable, 
                and if I kick at 150 to go, then I win, and I did.</font></p>

                </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A: 
                It was good, actually, because it opened up the pace, and made 
                some room, we had more space to move around. If you make a move 
                that far out, though, you cannot go all the way. Especially in 
                a mile race. You're done with 400 meters to go.</font></p>

                No, not in a field like this. Not with Kimani, not with Don Sage 
                from Stanford. You have to think about winning, but you can't 
                be eaten up by it. I got up this morning, had my brunch as usual, 
                a cup of coffee, and thought, I feel good. I feel like the best

                I come from Germany, I ran through high school and all over Europe, 
                and then I had to decide what I wanted to do. I wanted to get 
                a good education, and to run. So there was nothing else to do 
                but go to Illinois State! [Grins...]</font></p>

                Yes, I actually thought we went out a little slow. We went through 
                the 800 at about 2:01. It was a slow pace, and that gave everybody 
                time and energy. I decided I would try to win it, and I thought 
                I could until perhaps the last 200. That's where I had to kick 
                with Goy.</font></p>

                </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A: 
                It was pretty tough, running the DMR, being way behind and coming 
                up. I had to do it for my team. I had to do everything I can.

                A: Yes, I've had them taped. It's the same problem I had in cross

                cross country. Every time I run cross country, I get injured.

                all the way around?</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
                </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A: 
                I was getting pushed around a lot, for the first couple of laps.</font></p>

                Yeah. It was a very physical race for the first ten laps or so. 
                At that point, I was getting a little bit nervous about how it 
                was going to turn out, if I was going to have a chance to move 
                up, or if somebody broke away early on, if I was going to be able 
                to catch them. But it worked out just right, I got out of the 
                big pack right about at four laps to go, and started running the 
                pace I wanted to run. Then Nilsson, I think, came back and took 
                the lead, and that really started my engine, got the adrenaline 
                going, and then I just went for it with a lap to go.</font></p>

                that I wasn't going that fast, and I could see on the screen that

                Do you think you're more of a track runner now, than a cross-country 
                runner? You had a good high school cross-country career, but now 
                you've had two solid races on the track.<br>
                </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A: 
                I don't know. My high school ring has no track symbol on it, because 
                I was only a cross country runner in high school. But so far I've 
                had more success on the track than in cross country. I'm starting 
                to enjoy it more and more, which is good, because track's in the 
                Olympics, and cross country isn't. I've had such good experience, 
                every time I've gone to NCAA's in track, huge crowds, great fans.</font></p>

                Yes, I am, very much so. I can't wait for the spring, I'm loving

                </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A: 
                I might. I'd love to, I'd like to run a few eights. I'd like to 
                get my PR down in the 800. I'm at 2:08 now, but hopefully I'd 
                like to run 2:04 this season. I know eventually, if I'm going 
                to be a world class athlete, I'm going to have to run faster than 
                even 2:04 for a half-mile. I'm trying to kick start my year to 
                get myself down to my eventual goal time.</font></p>

                I'd like to keep this momentum going in my training, but as far 
                as times, I'd like to get down around 4:10 for the 1,500. I'll 
                probably run my first race at the Stanford Invite, the last weekend 
                of March. I'd like to get ready for a long season. I hope I'll 
                get to run over the summer, I haven't done that yet. I'm coming 
                up on my last year. After this spring it's just one season of 
                each left. I haven't redshirted a season yet, so I'm motoring 
                straight through on the four-year plan. I've been very fortunate 
                to stay healthy and stay motivated so far. I've had all the resources 
                available to have both, motivation and good health.</font></p>

                I like going with a little ways to go, and making the other boys 
                work. I really don't want to let anyone get by me in that last 
                lap, it would've been really heartbreaking. I set out to get ahead,

                I think I had the fastest 3k time and the fastest mile time [of 
                the 3k field] going in. So I was very confident that in any sort 
                of race, I'd be there at the end. It was the strongest 3k field 
                we've ever had, and with three laps to go I'd say any one of maybe 
                seven guys could've won it. Luckily, I got the breaks, and came 
                out on top.</font></p>

                </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A: 
                Possibly, I've been kicking very well in my last few races, and 
                in the DMR last night I felt really comfortable out there on my 
                own, so I was a lot more relaxed going in today, and I think the 
                lack of nerves definitely helped me out, it let me stay patient 
                with all the pushing and the shoving.</font></p>

                A: We're definitely running Penn, we'll do the DMR and the 4 x 
                Mile. I really want to go to the Commonwealth Games (representing 
                New Zealand), which is in Manchester. I've got to run 3:38 in 
                the 1,500 to get the qualifying time, I want to hit that fairly 
                early, maybe just after Penn Relays, get that time under my belt, 
                and then run NCAAs, then Commonwealth Games at the end of July.</font></p>

                As long as I get the time, and I back it up with a few other races 
                under 3:40 or 3:55 for the mile, they'll select me.</font></p>

                Are you the prime candidate?<br>
                </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A: 
                There's another guy who ran 3:55 a few years ago, who's trying 
                to make it, and Hamish Thorpe, who ran here today. And there's 
                a young guy, Nick Willis, who's going to try to make it. We're 
                all trying to hit the same time, and they take three, so if all 
                four of us make the qualifier, one's going to be upset. But I'll 
                just have to run faster than those three guys to make the team.</font></p>

                </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A: 
                Yes. I'm going to run a 5k in Florida early in the season, I haven't 
                run one since I was eighteen. I ran 14:18 to qualify for World 
                Juniors, but I was hurt for that. I haven't run one since. After 
                four years, I think it's time to put the hurt on in the 5k. It 
                will just be the one, I won't touch it for maybe a year after 
                that.</font></p>
