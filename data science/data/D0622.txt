<hr>
<p>This is our journey down the mountains of Jamaica on horseback along the Hooves Beach Trail. The journey begins at the Seville Estate located in St. Ann, Jamaica. We traveled along a trail, like the one you see in the picture above, that led to the Heritage Beach along the coast of the Caribbean Sea where we ran through the water with the horses.<br>
<br>
<img src="hooves6.jpg" align=left hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="The ride along the trail"><p>Upon entering the facility, we were given a guided tour of the ranch house and were shown many collectables that were gathered or that remained. After the tour, we were able to choose or horses and were given a brief instruction on how to ride the horses down the trail. We even got a quick history of our horses and where they came from. We then rode with our caravan down the trail while the guides explained the history and the beauty of Jamaica. Along the way, they would point out different fruit and plant life and their uses in their everyday life. The guides also told who owned the land and what the owners used to do with their property.
<br>
<br>
<img src="hooves3.jpg" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="Pitstop for picture taking"><p>Here we are with our tour guide. Although the trail looks like it is mostly in the woods (which it is), there weren't any bugs biting or crawling all over us. It was nice, enjoyable weather that helped make the trip more exciting. The guides stop frequently to allow for picture taking. The rule on these guided tours is that the guides carry your cameras, so there are not as many chances to snap a quick shot as there are things to look at. Fortunalely, we were able to carry ours until we got to the beach. As you can see in the background, we are almost to the sea. This part of the journey took about forty-five minutes to get to. It was near here that we saw land crab holes the size of soft balls. The guides pointed them out to us as we started head ing towards the beach. We were warned that we were safe during the day, but we wouldn't want to walk this trail at night, for that is when they come out. The land crabs are the ones they eat.<br>

<img src="craft02.jpg" width=300 height=150 align=left hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="Jamaican craft store on the beach"><p>On the beach at the end of the trail we came to this little craft store. It was one of many that we saw while we were in Ocho Rios. All the items sold were hand made; from earrings to necklaces to bracelets. The prices were reasonable and they accepted American currency. It was a good place to stop and stretch, as we are not used to riding horses. The guides gave everyone plenty of time to relax before we got back on the horses. Here we were asked to remove any loose items and get into our swim wear to take the horses through the sea. <br>
<br>

<img src="hooves4.jpg" align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 alt="Running the horses through the Caribbean Sea"><p>After looking over the goods the people had for sale, we took our horses for a refreshing ride through the sea. It seemed to be just as refreshing to the horses as it was for us. The guides bought us out so the water came up to our knees. When we were done, we got to get something to drink, then headed back to the ranch where we began. The return seemed shorter that the first half of the journey. This trip is one for beginners or advanced riders and is one everyone will enjoy.
