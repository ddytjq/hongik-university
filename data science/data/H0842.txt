Classiccomputed tomographic (CT) findings in NF1 with thoracic involvement includesmall, well-defined subcutaneous neurofibromas, focal thoracic scoliosis,posterior vertebral scalloping, enlarged neural foramina, and characteristicrib abnormalities due to bone dysplasia or erosion from adjacent neurofibromas.However, more atypical manifestations are occasionally seen, and magneticresonance (MR) imaging can be useful in equivocal cases. NF1 withabdominopelvic involvement tends to arise in the retroperitoneal, mesenteric,and paraspinal regions; it may be quite extensive and therefore difficult todistinguish from adenopathy at CT. The multiplanar capabilities of MR imaging,particularly with T2 weighting, make this modality helpful in evaluatingaffected patients and making the diagnosis. The classic peripheralmanifestations of NF1 include limb hemihypertrophy, pseudarthrosis, peripheralnerve neurofibromas, and subcutaneous common and plexiform neurofibromas. Insome cases of NF1, imaging findings are inconclusive, and biopsy and subsequentpathologic analysis are required. Familiarity with the various manifestationsof NF1 in different anatomic locations is important in making the diagnosis andoptimizing postdiagnostic treatment.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Neurofibromatosis-1-radiography;*Tomography,-X-Ray-Computed<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Diagnosis,-Differential; Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging;Neurofibromatosis-1-pathology<p>CHECKTAGS:  Human<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article; Review; Review,-Tutorial<p>SUBHEADINGS:  pathology; radiography<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20010802<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  21251316<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 2 of 66 in MEDLINE(R) on CD 2001/07<p>TITLE:  Chest wall hamartoma with Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome: clinical reportand brief review of chromosome 11p15.5-related tumors.<p>AUTHOR:  Jonas,-R-E; Kimonis,-V-E<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Pediatrics, Southern Illinois UniversitySchool of Medicine, Springfield, Illinois 62794-9230, USA.<p>SOURCE:  Am-J-Med-Genet. 2001 Jul 1; 101(3): 221-5<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0148-7299<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  2001<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  United-States<p>ABSTRACT:  A girl born with a left chest wall hamartoma, macroglossia, nevusflammeus of the middle forehead, and a small umbilical hernia developed leftlower extremity hemihypertrophy by 1 year of age and is assumed to haveWiedemann-Beckwith syndrome.

The association of a decreased ASM activity and anovergrowth disorder, Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) with hemihypertrophy hasbeen described at a 23 months old boy in a recent case report (Rethy et al, inthis issue). ASM catalyses the production of ceramide, a key molecule ofapoptosis, from sphingomyelin. Based on these data it is suggested that the ASMgene (SMPD1) can suppress/counterbalance the anti-apoptotic effects ofBWSrelated growth-promoters, like IGF-II, under normal circumstances. Recentliterary data support this view. ASM deficient lymphoblasts derived frompatients with Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) fail to undergo apoptosis in responseto external signals and Fas cross-linking. BWS-related genes are considered tobe regulated by genomic imprinting. Therefore the author compared somecharacteristics of both SMPD1 and imprinted genes. The analyzed features ofSMPD1 gene (few and small introns, Alu 1 repeat element, CC-rich regulatoryregion, alternative splicing) are characteristic to imprinted genes.Hemihypertrophy, mentioned in the referred BWS-case, is distinctive to theinvolvement of the maternal allele of the second BWS chromosomal region(BWSCR2) at 11p15.3. The SMPDI gene has been localized just distal to the B05breakpoint of BWSCR2. Furthermore, in BWS-associated tumors, the loss ofheterozygosity (LOH) found on 11p15 was always maternal. Thus, in the casereferred to with ASM deficiency the maternal allele has certainly beeneffected. These conclusions are in accordance with the 'cluster-model ofimprinting' as well as with the conflict theory of imprinting. Taken together,the above mentioned clinical and experimental data suggest that SMPD1, mostlikely at 11p15.4, is an imprinted, maternally expressed, BWS- andapoptosis-related growth suppressor gene. Further studies are necessary toprove this hypothesis.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Beckwith-Wiedemann-Syndrome-genetics; *Growth-;*Sphingomyelin-Phosphodiesterase-genetics<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Beckwith-Wiedemann-Syndrome-physiopathology;Genomic-Imprinting; Infant-; Sphingomyelin-Phosphodiesterase-physiology<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  genetics; physiopathology; physiology<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  EC 3.1.4.12<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  Sphingomyelin-Phosphodiesterase<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20010517<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  21204314<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 5 of 66 in MEDLINE (R) 2001/01-2001/05<p>TITLE:  Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency in Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome.<p>AUTHOR:  Rethy-,-L-A; Kalmanchey-,-R; Klujber-,-V; Koos-,-R; Fekete-,-G<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Paediatrics, Semmelweis University, Budapest,Hungary. retlaj@yahoo.com<p>SOURCE:  Pathol-Oncol-Res. 2000; 6(4): 295-7<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  1219-4956<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  2000<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  England<p>ABSTRACT:  We report the association of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and aresidual acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) activity of about 35% in a 23 months oldHungarian boy. Besides the classical triad of exomphalos, macroglossia andgigantism some other BWS-related features: polyhydramnios (known from thepraenatal history), hemihypertrophy, craniofacial dysmorphy, a mild mentalretardation, bilaterally undescended testes, cardiac anomalies and a terminallydeveloped, fatal embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma were present in the patient. Thedecreased activity of the ASM was measured in the patient s skin fibroblasts.This result, with hepatomegaly, mental retardation, feeding problems, a failureto thrive and muscle-hypotony, partially resembled the ASM-deficient forms ofNiemann-Pick disease (NPD). Morphological analysis of the bone-marrow cellsgave normal results. There was no chromosomal alteration found by conventionalkaryotyping of the patient s lymphocytes.BWS-associated genes as well as thehuman ASM gene (SMPD1) are all located at 11p15. DNA-studies by region specificmarkers as well as mutational analysis for the most common NPD-mutations areplanned in the future. This is the first report on the simultaneous occurrenceof BWS and ASM-deficiency.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Beckwith-Wiedemann-Syndrome-complications;*Sphingomyelin-Phosphodiesterase-deficiency<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Infant-; Insulin-Like-Growth-Factor-II-metabolism;Rhabdomyosarcoma,-Embryonal-complications<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  complications; metabolism; deficiency<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  67763-97-7; EC 3.1.4.12<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  Insulin-Like-Growth-Factor-II;Sphingomyelin-Phosphodiesterase<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20010517<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  21111254<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 6 of 66 in MEDLINE (R) 2001/01-2001/05<p>TITLE:  A child with adrenocortical adenoma accompanied by congenitalhemihypertrophy: report of a case.<p>AUTHOR:  Hara,-F; Kishikawa,-T; Tomishige,-H; Nishikawa,-O; Nishida,-Y;Kongo,-M<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Pediatric Surgery, Fujita Health UniversitySchool of Medicine, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan.<p>SOURCE:  Surg-Today. 2000; 30(9): 861-5<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0941-1291<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  2000<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  JAPAN<p>ABSTRACT:  We report herein the findings of a 7-year-old male child with aruptured adrenocortical adenoma and congenital hemihypertrophy which wasincidentally detected after suffering a trauma. A review of 21 pediatric casesof adrenocortical neoplasms in the literature was made. The patient showedprecocious puberty such as pubis and advanced bone age, but an endocrinologicalexamination revealed no definite abnormalities. The right adrenal tumor withhematoma was resected after these evaluations. Adrenocortical adenoma isconsidered to occur more frequently in female children. However, the incidenceof adrenocortical tumors accompanied by congenital hemihypertrophy does notdiffer between males and females. The outcomes were relatively good, althoughthe observation periods were short in some patients. A large number of patientspresented with a tumor and hemihypertrophy on the same side. This finding is ofinterest when considering the possible association between hemihypertrophy ofthe organs and tumor proliferation. However, their association in terms ofdevelopment was unclear. It is necessary for patients with hemihypertrophy tohave regular examinations for the possible development of malignant tumors,especially in the kidney, adrenal gland, and liver.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Adenoma,-Adrenal-Cortical-complications;*Adrenal-Cortex-Neoplasms-complications<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Child-; Hypertrophy-congenital; Laterality-<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article; Review; Review-of-Reported-Cases<p>SUBHEADINGS:  complications; congenital<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20010222<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  20492865<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 7 of 66 in MEDLINE (R) 2001/01-2001/05<p>TITLE:  Intraabdominal lymphangiomyoma in an infant with protein-losingenteropathy and hemihypertrophy.<p>AUTHOR:  Koltuksuz,-U; Ozgen,-U; Ozen,-S; Sarac,-K; Gursoy,-M-H<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Pediatric Surgery, Inonu University Facultyof Medicine, Malatya, Turkey.<p>SOURCE:  Turk-J-Pediatr. 2000 Oct-Dec; 42(4): 341-3<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0041-4301<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  2000<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  Turkey<p>ABSTRACT:  Lymphangiomyoma is an extremely rare tumor occurring exclusively inwomen of reproductive age.

PTEN is a tumour suppressorand dual-specificity phosphatase which affects apoptosis via its lipidphosphatase activity in the phosphoinositol-3-kinase and AKT pathway as well asinhibiting cell spreading via the focal adhesion kinase pathway. CS and BRRshare some features, such as hamartomas and lipomatosis. To determine whetherother syndromes characterized by overgrowth and lipomas are part of the PTENsyndrome spectrum, we ascertained six individuals with overgrowth and lipomasbut who did not meet the diagnostic criteria for CS or BRR. Five had Proteussyndrome and one, a Proteus-like syndrome. When germline DNA and DNA from atleast one involved tissue per case were examined for PTEN mutations, only theProteus-like patient was found to harbour a germline R335X mutation.Interestingly, a lipomatous mass, an epidermoid naevus and arteriovenousmalformation tissue, all of which were sampled from physically distinct sites,were all found to carry a second hit R130X mutation on the allele opposite thegermline R335X. Both mutations have been described in CS and BRR. We postulatethat the second hit, R130X, occurred early in embryonic development and mayeven represent germline mosaicism. Thus, PTEN may be involved in Proteus-likesyndrome with its implications for cancer development in the future.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Arteriovenous-Malformations-genetics;*Germ-Line-Mutation; *Limb-Deformities,-Congenital-genetics;*Lipomatosis-genetics; *Phosphoric-Monoester-Hydrolases-genetics;*Proteus-Syndrome-genetics<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Base-Sequence; DNA-Primers; Hypertrophy-;Reverse-Transcriptase-Polymerase-Chain-Reaction<p>CHECKTAGS:  Human; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't; Support,-U.S.-Gov't,-P.H.S.<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  genetics<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  0; EC 3.1.3; EC 3.1.3.-<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  DNA-Primers; Phosphoric-Monoester-Hydrolases;PTEN-protein<p>CONTRACT OR GRANT NUMBERS:  P30CA16058CANCI<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  20215304<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 11 of 66 in MEDLINE (R) 1999 Part B<p>TITLE:  Oral manifestations of Schimmelpenning syndrome: case report and reviewof literature.<p>AUTHOR:  Murakami,-A; Skovby,-F; Andreasen,-J-O; Cohen,-M-M; Jensen,-B-L;Kreiborg,-S<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Pediatric Dentistry, School of Dentistry,Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.<p>SOURCE:  Ann-Acad-Med-Singapore. 1999 Sep; 28(5): 744-8<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0304-4602<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1999<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  SINGAPORE<p>ABSTRACT:  Schimmelpenning syndrome (SS) is characterised by specific skinmanifestations, skeletal defects, and central nervous system abnormalities.Here, the SS is briefly reviewed, and the oral and dental manifestations aredescribed in a patient whose medical findings were previously published andincluded severe hypophosphatemic rickets.

When it issystematized, it is indistinguishable from hypomelanosis of Ito. Pigmentaryanomalies along the lines of Blaschko can be associated with systemic features.For these reasons, 20 children, referred consecutively for evaluation ofsegmental, linear achromic nevus, were evaluated to define the incidence ofassociated abnormal systemic features. Extracutaneous abnormalities werepresent in 2 of 20 children (10%).

We report a patientwith hemimegalencephaly, hemihypertrophy, macrocephaly, vascular lesions,psychomotor retardation and intestinal lymphangiectasia. The clinical historyand findings posed a diagnostic dilemma as the features overlapped betweenseveral conditions, namely macrocephaly-cutis marmorata telangiectaticacongenita (M-CMTC), Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome (KTWS), Proteus syndromeand a provisional unique syndrome described by Reardon et al. (1996, Am J MedGenet 66:144-149).

It encompasses a spectrum ofmultifaceted disorders and may present with a wide range of clinicalmanifestations, including abnormalities of the skin, nervous tissue, bones, andsoft tissues. The condition can be conclusively diagnosed when two of sevencriteria established by the National Institutes of Health Consensus DevelopmentConference are met. Most children with NF-1 have no major orthopaedic problems.For those with musculoskeletal involvement, the most important issue is earlyrecognition. Spinal deformity, congenital tibial dysplasia (congenital bowingand pseudarthrosis), and disorders of excessive bone and soft-tissue growth arethe three types of musculoskeletal manifestations that require evaluation.Statistics gathered from the Cincinnati Children's Hospital NeurofibromatosisCenter database show the incidence of spinal deformity in children with NF-1 tobe 23.6%; pectus deformity, 4.3%; limb-length inequality, 7.1%; congenitaltibial dysplasia, 5.7%; hemihypertrophy, 1.4%; and plexiform neurofibromas,25%. The orthopaedic complications can be managed, but only rarely are theycured.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Bone-Diseases,-Developmental-surgery;*Bone-Neoplasms-surgery; *Neurofibromatosis-1-surgery; *Orthopedic-Procedures<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Bone-Diseases,-Developmental-diagnosis;Bone-Neoplasms-diagnosis; Child-; Neurofibromatosis-1-diagnosis;Patient-Care-Team<p>CHECKTAGS:  Human<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article; Review; Review,-Tutorial<p>SUBHEADINGS:  diagnosis; surgery<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  99365495<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 15 of 66 in MEDLINE (R) 1999 Part A<p>TITLE:  Adrenocortical neoplasms in children: radiologic-pathologiccorrelation.<p>AUTHOR:  Agrons,-G-A; Lonergan,-G-J; Dickey,-G-E; Perez-Monte,-J-E<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Radiology, Pennsylvania Hospital,Philadelphia 19107, USA.<p>SOURCE:  Radiographics. 1999 Jul-Aug; 19(4): 989-1008<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0271-5333<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1999<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  Primary neoplasms of the adrenal cortex are rare in children anddiffer significantly in epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and biologicfeatures from their counterparts in adults. In children, the inclusive termadrenocortical neoplasm is applied because adrenal adenoma and adrenalcarcinoma may be difficult to distinguish histopathologically. Pediatricadrenocortical neoplasms typically occur before 5 years of age, affect younggirls more commonly than boys, and are associated with hemihypertrophy andBeckwith-Wiedemann and Li-Fraumeni syndromes. Most children with anadrenocortical neoplasm present with signs and symptoms of endocrineabnormality, including virilization and Cushing syndrome. Cross-sectionalimaging studies typically demonstrate a large, circumscribed, predominantlysolid suprarenal mass with variable heterogeneity due to hemorrhage andnecrosis. Calcification is not uncommon. Local invasion and metastases to thelungs, liver, and regional lymph nodes may be present at diagnosis. Whenfriable tumor thrombus extends into the inferior vena cava, it poses a highrisk of pulmonary embolization. The finding of increased retroperitoneal fatdue to hypercortisolism on computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imagesof children with an adrenal mass favors the diagnosis of adrenocorticalneoplasm. Surgical resection is the mainstay of therapy, with chemotherapy usedfor patients with metastases or persistent elevated hormone levels followingsurgery. Patients younger than 5 years with aggressive adrenocortical neoplasmsfare better than older children.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Adrenal-Cortex-Neoplasms-pathology;*Diagnostic-Imaging<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Adrenal-Cortex-Neoplasms-complications;Adrenal-Cortex-Neoplasms-diagnosis; Child-; Child,-Preschool;Diagnosis,-Differential; Infant-<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article; Review; Review,-Tutorial<p>SUBHEADINGS:  complications; diagnosis; pathology<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  99394071<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 16 of 66 in MEDLINE (R) 1999 Part A<p>TITLE:  Orthotopic liver transplantation for unresectable hepatoblastoma: asingle center's experience.<p>AUTHOR:  Al-Qabandi,-W; Jenkinson,-H-C; Buckels,-J-A; Mayer,-A-D; McKiernan,-P;Morland,-B; John,-P; Kelly,-D<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Oncology, The Birmingham Children's HospitalNHS Trust, England.<p>SOURCE:  J-Pediatr-Surg. 1999 Aug; 34(8): 1261-4<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0022-3468<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1999<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Complete surgical resection after chemotherapyis the definitive treatment for hepatoblastoma. However, orthotopic livertransplantation (OLT) is now accepted as a treatment modality for patients withunresectable tumours. The aim of this study was to review a single center'sexperience of OLT for unresectable hepatoblastoma. METHODS: A retrospectivereview of 8 patients with unresectable hepatoblastoma who were referred forliver transplantation was conducted. RESULTS: The patients assessed had an agerange of 5 to 105 months at presentation; median, 24 months, (5 boys; 3 girls).Two patients have familial adenomatous polyposis, and one has righthemihypertrophy. All 8 patients had received standard chemotherapy according toSIOP (International Society of Pediatric Oncology) protocols. Extrahepaticmetastases were found in 3 patients at diagnosis, but none had detectablemetastases at the time of OLT. Four patients continued chemotherapy whileawaiting OLT. Three patients received whole grafts, and 5 received reducedgrafts. The median follow-up period was 22 months (range, 2 to 78 months). Fivepatients are alive and well, although 1 patient had a second OLT for biliarycirrhosis secondary to biliary stricture at 6 years. Three patients died: one26 days post OLT of sepsis and two of disease recurrence at 22 months and 70months posttransplant. The actuarial survival rate is 88% and 65% at 1 and 5years, respectively, whereas the overall survival rate is 62.5%. CONCLUSION:OLT for unresectable hepatoblastoma without extra hepatic metastases is highlysuccessful with a low recurrence rate.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Hepatoblastoma-surgery; *Liver-Neoplasms-surgery;*Liver-Transplantation<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Antineoplastic-Agents,-Combined-therapeutic-use;Child,-Preschool; Follow-Up-Studies; Hepatoblastoma-drug-therapy;Hepatoblastoma-mortality; Liver-Neoplasms-drug-therapy;Liver-Neoplasms-mortality; Retrospective-Studies; Survival-Rate<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  therapeutic-use; drug-therapy; mortality; surgery<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  0<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  Antineoplastic-Agents,-Combined<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  99394484<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 17 of 66 in MEDLINE (R) 1999 Part A<p>TITLE:  Congenital hemihypertrophy and epithelioid haemangioendothelioma in a10-year-old boy: a case report.<p>AUTHOR:  Miller,-J-H; Gillet,-P-M; Hendry,-G-M; Wallace,-W-H<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Radiology, Royal Hospital for Sick Children,Sciennes Road, Edinburgh EH9 1LF, UK.<p>SOURCE:  Pediatr-Radiol. 1999 Aug; 29(8): 613-6<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0301-0449<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1999<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  GERMANY<p>ABSTRACT:  Epithelioid haemangioendothelioma has not been previously describedin a patient with congenital hemihypertrophy and diabetes mellitus.

However, thereis a paucity of published data supporting this strategy. The purpose of thisstudy was to determine whether sonographic screening at intervals of 4 monthsor less reduced the proportion of late-stage Wilms Tumor (WT) in children withBWS/HH. PROCEDURE: A case series analysis was employed to compare theproportion of late-stage (stage III or IV) Wilms tumor in patients with BWS/HHwho were screened with sonography (n = 15) to the proportion of late-stageWilms tumor in unscreened patients with BWS/HH (n = 59). Patients wereidentified from the BWS Registry and from previously published studies.Screened patients had sonograms at intervals of 4 months or less. RESULTS: Noneof the 12 screened children with Wilms tumor had late-stage disease, whereas 25of 59 (42%) of unscreened children had late-stage Wilms tumor, a differencethat was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.003). Three children had falsepositive screening studies. They were operated on for suspected Wilms tumor butthe lesions proved to be complicated renal cysts (n = 2) or nephroblastomatosis(n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that children with BWS/HH may benefitfrom screening sonograms at intervals of 4 months or less. However, falsepositive screening exams may result in unnecessary surgery. Given the rarity ofBWS/HH, a larger, prospective international screening study is necessary todetermine if the benefits of screening outweigh the risks.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Beckwith-Wiedemann-Syndrome-complications;*Nephroblastoma-ultrasonography<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Adult-; Child-; Child,-Preschool;Hypertrophy-; Infant-; Infant,-Newborn; Mass-Screening; Neoplasm-Staging;Nephroblastoma-etiology; Nephroblastoma-pathology<p>CHECKTAGS:  Human; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  complications; etiology; pathology; ultrasonography<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  99161950<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 21 of 66 in MEDLINE (R) 1999 Part A<p>TITLE:  Renal findings on radiological followup of patients withBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.<p>AUTHOR:  Borer,-J-G; Kaefer,-M; Barnewolt,-C-E; Elias,-E-R; Hobbs,-N;Retik,-A-B; Peters,-C-A<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Urology, Children's Hospital and HarvardMedical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.<p>SOURCE:  J-Urol. 1999 Jan; 161(1): 235-9<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0022-5347<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1999<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  PURPOSE: The Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is most commonlycharacterized by macroglossia and abdominal wall defect(s), and it carries apredisposition to embryonal tumors, including Wilms tumor. We report ourexperience with the character and incidence of renal disease in patients withthe Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, and discuss the role of radiological followup.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of all patientsdiagnosed with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome who were treated at ourinstitution between March 1979 and February 1998. Radiological followupconsisted of renal ultrasound at approximately 3 to 6-month intervals with theaddition of computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) inpatients with an indeterminate lesion(s) or nephrogenic rest(s). RESULTS: Atotal of 29 patients were identified. Of these cases renal ultrasound showednormal kidneys bilaterally in 19 (70%), simple cysts in 5 (19%), indeterminatelesion(s) in 2 (7%) and nephrocalcinosis in 1 (4%). Nephrogenic rests werefollowed with MRI in 1 patient, and 1 in whom a 2 cm. mass was revealed byfollowup MRI underwent partial nephrectomy and chemotherapy for stage I Wilmstumor. CONCLUSIONS: The 3.7% incidence of Wilms tumor in our patients with theBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is similar to that in previously published reports.Aggressive follow-up by a sensitive radiological technique is warranted incases of the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, and associated hemihypertrophy and/ornephromegaly with or without evidence of a Wilms tumor precursor. The detectionof suspected malignant disease at an early stage may permit curative nephronsparing surgery.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Beckwith-Wiedemann-Syndrome-complications;*Kidney-Diseases-etiology; *Kidney-Diseases-radiography<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Child-; Child,-Preschool;Follow-Up-Studies; Infant-; Kidney-Diseases-pathology;Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  complications; etiology; pathology; radiography<p>SUBSET:  Abridged-Index-Medicus; Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  99155017<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 22 of 66 in MEDLINE (R) 1999 Part A<p>TITLE:  Hemihypertrophy and a poorly differentiated embryonal rhabdomyosarcomaof the pelvis.<p>AUTHOR:  Samuel,-D-P; Tsokos,-M; DeBaun,-M-R<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Pediatric Branch, National Cancer Institute, NationalInstitute of Health, Bethesda, MD 20895, USA. samueld@exchange.nih.gov<p>SOURCE:  Med-Pediatr-Oncol. 1999 Jan; 32(1): 38-43<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0098-1532<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1999<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND: Asymmetry of the limbs (conventionally known ashemihypertrophy) is one of the overgrowth syndromes occurring sporadically inthe general population at a frequency of approximately 1:86,000.Hemihypertrophy is also reported as part of the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromewhich has as its cardinal features omphalocele, macroglossia and gigantism withhypoglycemia, organomegaly, renal anomalies, hemihypertrophy, and embryonaltumors occurring less frequently. Various neoplasms are also associated withisolated hemihypertrophy. Wilms tumor, adrenocortical carcinoma, andhepatoblastoma are the most frequent. Rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma,phaeochromocytoma, and undifferentiated sarcoma of the lung are encounteredonly rarely. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 11p15.5 is stronglyassociated with childhood embryonal tumors, particularly Wilms tumor,hepatoblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. PROCEDURE AND RESULTS: In this article,we describe an adolescent male with congenital asymmetry of the lower limbs whopresented with a large poorly differentiated pelvic sarcoma. Conventionalhistologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural studies of this tumor wereinsufficient for accurate subclassfication. However, positive staining forMyoD1 (a recently identified embryonically expressed marker of muscledifferentiation) and LOH at the tyrosine hydroxylase locus of chromosome11p15.5 by molecular analysis favored the diagnosis of embryonalrhabdomyosarcoma over an undifferentiated sarcoma. CONCLUSIONS: This casestresses the importance of pursuing clinical findings when they occur inconditions with an increased risk of developing cancer, which in this case wasasymmetry of a limb. Also illustrated by this patient is the need for earlyconsideration of molecular diagnostic tests where available, to refine anuncertain pathologic diagnosis that may ultimately have an impact on treatmentand prognosis.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Foot-Deformities,-Congenital-complications;*Leg-abnormalities; *Pelvic-Neoplasms-complications;*Rhabdomyosarcoma,-Embryonal-complications<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Chromosomes,-Human,-Pair-11-genetics;Fatal-Outcome; Hypertrophy-; Immunohistochemistry-; Loss-of-Heterozygosity;Lung-Neoplasms-secondary; MyoD-Protein-analysis; Pelvic-Neoplasms-genetics;Pelvic-Neoplasms-pathology; Rhabdomyosarcoma,-Embryonal-genetics;Rhabdomyosarcoma,-Embryonal-pathology; Rhabdomyosarcoma,-Embryonal-secondary;Trans-Activators-analysis<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  genetics; complications; abnormalities; secondary; analysis;pathology<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  0; 0; 0<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  MyoD-Protein; Trans-Activators; protein-MyoD1<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  99116276<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 23 of 66 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part B<p>TITLE:  Yolk sac tumor of the placenta in Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome.<p>AUTHOR:  Drut,-R; Mortera,-M; Drut,-R-M<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Pathology, Hospital de Ninos "Superiora SorMaria Ludovica," 14 No. 1631, 1900 La Plata, Argentina.<p>SOURCE:  Pediatr-Dev-Pathol. 1998 Nov-Dec; 1(6): 534-7<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  1093-5266<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  The present report describes an example of multifocal (two) yolk sactumor (YST) with mesenchyme-like and enteroid patterns found in the placenta(730 g) of a newborn (4200 g) with Wiedemann-Beckwith syndrome (WBS) phenotype(macroglossia, omphalocele, hemihypertrophy, cardiomegaly, hypoglycemia).

It maybe an isolated finding in an otherwise normal individual, or it may occur inseveral syndromes. Although isolated hemihyperplasia (IHH) is of unknown cause,it may represent one end of the clinical spectrum of the Wiedemann-Beckwithsyndrome (WBS). Uniparental paternal disomy of 11p15.5 or altered expression ofinsulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) from the normally silent maternal allelehave been implicated as causes of some cases of WBS. IHH and other mildmanifestations of WBS may represent patchy overexpression of the IGF2 genefollowing defective imprinting in a mosaic fashion. The natural history of IHHvaries markedly. An association among many overgrowth syndromes and apredisposition to neoplasia is well recognized. Heretofore the risk for tumordevelopment in children with IHH was unknown. We report on the results of aprospective multicenter clinical study of the incidence and nature of neoplasiain children evaluated because of IHH. One hundred sixty-eight patients wereascertained. A total of 10 tumors developed in nine patients, for an overallincidence of 5.9%. Tumors were of embryonal origin (similar to those noted inother overgrowth disorders), including Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, adrenalcell carcinoma, and leiomyosarcoma of the small bowel in one case.

The fetal renal tissuematures into normal renal parenchyma during gestation, but, occasionally, fetaltissue persists into infancy as microscopic foci called nephrogenic rests.Nephrogenic rests are found in approximately 1% of infant kidneys at autopsy.Nephrogenic rests are associated with an increased risk of Wilms tumor, and itis theorized that nephrogenic rests undergo neoplastic change into Wilms tumor.Fortunately, this transformation occurs in less than 1% of young children withnephrogenic rests. Nephrogenic rests are associated with many syndromes,including Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, hemihypertrophy, and sporadic aniridia.Children with identifiable syndromes, once diagnosed, should be screened forthe development of Wilms tumor. Nephrogenic rests are associated with otherlesions such as multilocular cystic nephroma and multicystic dysplasia, usuallywithout malignant complications.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Kidney-Diseases-diagnosis;*Kidney-Neoplasms-diagnosis; *Nephroblastoma-diagnosis; *Nephrons-;*Precancerous-Conditions-diagnosis<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Beckwith-Wiedemann-Syndrome-diagnosis;Beckwith-Wiedemann-Syndrome-embryology; Beckwith-Wiedemann-Syndrome-pathology;Child-; Child,-Preschool; Choristoma-diagnosis; Choristoma-embryology;Choristoma-pathology; Diagnostic-Imaging; Infant-; Infant,-Newborn;Kidney-embryology; Kidney-pathology; Kidney-Diseases-embryology;Kidney-Diseases-pathology; Kidney-Neoplasms-embryology;Kidney-Neoplasms-pathology; Nephroblastoma-embryology;Nephroblastoma-pathology; Precancerous-Conditions-embryology;Precancerous-Conditions-pathology<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male; Pregnancy<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article; Review; Review,-Tutorial<p>SUBHEADINGS:  diagnosis; embryology; pathology<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98336851<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 29 of 66 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part A<p>TITLE:  Pediatric peripheral neuropathy in proteus syndrome.<p>AUTHOR:  Choi,-M-L; Wey,-P-D; Borah,-G-L<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Surgery, UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson MedicalSchool, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, USA.<p>SOURCE:  Ann-Plast-Surg. 1998 May; 40(5): 528-32<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0148-7043<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  Proteus syndrome is a rare congenital disorder comprised ofsubcutaneous and internal hamartomas, pigmented skin nevi, skull exostoses,hemihypertrophy, and macrodactyly of the hands and feet. A 5-year-old girldiagnosed with Proteus syndrome presented with distal median compressionneuropathy with the primary complaint of severe pain involving the left hand.Surgical exploration of the hand revealed a lipofibromatous hamartoma of themedian nerve. The transverse carpal ligament was released and epineurectomy ofthe median nerve was performed. The patient remains symptom free at the 9-monthfollow-up. This report is the first description of a hamartoma directlyinvolving a peripheral nerve in Proteus syndrome. Decompression of the nervewith the removal of the fibrofatty neural sheath resulted in the resolution ofthe symptoms in this patient.

The average annual incidence of cancer in the first 4years of life was 0.027 cancer per person-year. The RR of Wilms tumor (RR =816; 95% confidence interval [CI], 359-1156), neuroblastoma (RR = 197; 95% CI,22-711), and hepatoblastoma (RR = 2280; 95% CI, 928-11,656) were statisticallysignificant. Asymmetry of the limbs (hemihypertrophy) was the only clinicalfeature associated with an increased RR of cancer (RR = 4.6; 95% CI, 1.5-14.2).Given the high incidence of cancer in infancy and early childhood of patientswith BWS, a prospective study is warranted to address the utility of screeningfor cancer.<p>COMMENTS:  Comment In: J Pediatr. 1998 Mar;132(3 Pt 1):377-9<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Beckwith-Wiedemann-Syndrome-complications;*Hepatoblastoma-complications; *Nephroblastoma-complications;*Neuroblastoma-complications<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Beckwith-Wiedemann-Syndrome-physiopathology;Child,-Preschool; Cohort-Studies; Hepatoblastoma-epidemiology; Incidence-;Infant-; Nephroblastoma-epidemiology; Neuroblastoma-epidemiology; Registries-;Risk-<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  complications; physiopathology; epidemiology<p>SUBSET:  Abridged-Index-Medicus; Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98204450<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 34 of 66 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part A<p>TITLE:  Proteus syndrome.

METHODS: We conducted aretrospective review of nine cases treated between 1976 and 1996 at the RoyalChildren's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. RESULTS: Six children with Cushing'sdisease and three with primary adrenal disease were identified. Mean age atdiagnosis in the Cushing's disease patients was 11.3 years and in the childrenwith primary adrenal disease 9.5 years. The most common presenting symptomswere weight gain and delayed growth. Two children had the unusual presentingsymptoms of an eating disorder and hemihypertrophy, respectively. Laboratorydiagnosis of Cushing's syndrome was established by demonstration of elevatedurine free cortisol, loss of normal diurnal variation of serum cortisol, andloss of suppressibility of cortisol secretion by low dose dexamethasone.Investigations used to determine the aetiology of hypercortisolism includedserum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, high dose dexamethasonesuppression tests, imaging studies, and inferior petrosal sinus sampling. Fourpatients with Cushing's disease had successful transphenoidal adenomectomies.Two patients with bilateral primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical dysplasiaunderwent bilateral adrenalectomies. One child with an adrenal adenoma wastreated by left adrenalectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Cushing's syndrome in children andadolescents remains a diagnostic challenge. Successful treatment often requiresthe use of multiple tests to achieve the correct diagnosis, appropriate surgeryand a good long-term outcome.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Cushing-Syndrome-diagnosis<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adenoma-surgery; Adolescence-; Adrenalectomy-;Age-Determination-by-Skeleton; Child-; Child,-Preschool; Circadian-Rhythm;Corticotropin-blood; Cushing-Syndrome-physiopathology;Cushing-Syndrome-surgery; Diagnosis,-Differential; Hydrocortisone-blood;Hydrocortisone-urine; Infant-; Pituitary-Gland-surgery;Pituitary-Neoplasms-surgery; Retrospective-Studies; Treatment-Outcome<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  surgery; blood; diagnosis; physiopathology; urine<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  50-23-7; 9002-60-2<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  Hydrocortisone; Corticotropin<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98145717<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 36 of 66 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part B<p>TITLE:  Aspectos neurofisiologicos en el sindrome de Proteus.<p>[Neurophysiological aspects of Proteus syndrome]<p>AUTHOR:  Manquillo,-A; Martinez-Mena,-J; Quintana,-P; Paradinas,-F; Saez,-J;Revilla,-C; Galan,-J-M<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Servicio de Neurofisiologia Clinica, Hospital Ramon yCajal, Madrid, Espana.<p>SOURCE:  Rev-Neurol. 1997 Oct; 25(146): 1572-4<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0210-0010<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE:  Spanish; Non-English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  SPAIN<p>ABSTRACT:  INTRODUCTION: The Proteus Syndrome was defined in 1983 by Wiedeman.However, the first case mentioned in the literature was that of Joseph Merrick,the Elephant Man, presented by Sir Frederick Treves in 1884. It is a rarepathological condition. Its multiple clinical features include; partialgigantism of hands and/or feet, pigmented nevi, hemihypertrophy of the body,tumors, skeletal anomalies, growth disorders and visceral anomalies. Hereditarytransmission has not been clearly defined. Diagnosis and treatment require theparticipation of experts from several medical and surgical specialties.CLINICAL CASE: We present a case sent to our hospital for the surgicalcorrection of cranio-facial malformations. Epileptic crises post-operativelyindicated the need for neurological and neuro-physiological study. This wasdone by means of conventional electro-encephalography: brainstem,somato-sensorial and visual auditory evoked potentials, together with imagingtechniques which showed the structural and functional asymmetry of the centralnervous system at both cerebral and brainstem levels. CONCLUSIONS: Fewneuro-physiological studies are included in the literature we reviewed for thispaper. Therefore we do not know whether the functional anomalies of the centralnervous system which we describe should be considered to be part of thesyndrome.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Brain-pathology; *Proteus-Syndrome-diagnosis<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adult-; Brain-abnormalities; Brain-physiopathology;Electroencephalography-; Evoked-Potentials,-Auditory,-Brain-Stem;Evoked-Potentials,-Visual; Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging;Proteus-Syndrome-physiopathology<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Female; Human<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  abnormalities; pathology; physiopathology; diagnosis<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98041238<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 37 of 66 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part B<p>TITLE:  Hemihypertrophy.

The records of 9 children (5 boys, 4girls) diagnosed at Vall d'Hebron Hospital with bilateral Wilms tumor between1976-1995 were analyzed. Six patients had synchronous tumors and 3 hadmetachronous lesions. Genitourinary malformations were present in 4 childrenand another had hemihypertrophy. Two children were brothers. Eight patientsunderwent pre-operative radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. Five patientshad nephrectomy on one side (3 of them had metachronous presentation) andpartial nephrectomy on the other side. The other children had bilateral partialnephrectomy or tumorectomy. Seven out of the nine patients are alive (78%). Thetwo children who died presented with stage IV tumors and high grade malignant.One boy suffers cardiomyopathy. All survivors have normal renal function.

In one group of patients, brain lesions may be consequentto vascular abnormalities ("vascular variant"); another group of SN patientspresents ipsilateral hemimegalencephaly, gyral anomalies, and facialhemihypertrophy ("neurologic variant" or "SN with hemimegalencephaly"). In thelatter group, facial hemihypertrophy does not appear to be a constant featureand was not present in our 2 SN patients with hemimegalencephaly. Consideringthat about half of the SN patients with hemimegalencephaly described so far donot have facial asymmetry, we suggest the existence of a separate subgroup ofSN patients with hemimegalencephaly and without facial hemihypertrophy. Inthese patients, the only clinical diagnostic clue is a nevus that is barelyvisible until puberty.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Brain-abnormalities; *Facial-Dermatoses-genetics;*Hamartoma-genetics; *Spasms,-Infantile-genetics<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Brain-pathology; Cerebral-Cortex-abnormalities;Cerebral-Cortex-pathology; Cerebral-Ventricles-abnormalities;Cerebral-Ventricles-pathology; Dominance,-Cerebral-physiology; Infant-;Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging; Syndrome-<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Female; Human<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  abnormalities; pathology; physiology; genetics<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  97452569<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 40 of 66 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part A<p>TITLE:  Proteus-Syndrom: Ein Fallbericht.<p>[Proteus syndrome: a case report]<p>AUTHOR:  Reize,-P; Schonthaler,-M; Sell,-S<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Orthopadische Universitatsklinik Tubingen.<p>SOURCE:  Z-Orthop-Ihre-Grenzgeb. 1997 Mar-Apr; 135(2): 174-8<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0044-3220<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE:  German; Non-English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  GERMANY<p>ABSTRACT:  The Proteus-syndrome is a recently described congenitalhamartomatosis consisting of numerous clinical features of great variety.Mainly affected are the musculo-skeletal system, primarily by hemihypertrophy,macrodactyly and exostoses, and the skin and the subcutaneous tissue, primarilyby pigmented naevi and subcutaneous tumors.

Multiplesmall tumors were present in both kidneys. The initial diagnostic biopsy showedstage I monophasic blastematous Wilms' tumor of favorable histology, withmultiple perilobar nephrogenic rests (nephroblastomatosis). By flow cytometry,tumor was diploid, with an S-phase fraction of 13.9%. Dactinomycin andvincristine were begun as per the National Wilms' Tumor Study IV (18 weekcourse). After 1 month, only a single small lesion was evident, which persistedunchanged. Excisional biopsy 5 months after beginning chemotherapy showedentirely necrotic tumor but apparently unaltered nephrogenic rests. Aftercompleting chemotherapy, the child has done well, with normal renal functionand no evidence of disease 3 years after diagnosis. Management of stage VWilms' tumor is tailored to the individual case, being as conservative aspossible to spare renal parenchyma. Given the high incidence of coexistingnephrogenic rests in bilateral Wilms' tumor, careful follow-up is required, asthese potentially premalignant rests may resist chemotherapy.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Kidney-Neoplasms-pathology;*Kidney-Neoplasms-therapy; *Neoplasms,-Multiple-Primary-therapy;*Nephroblastoma-pathology; *Nephroblastoma-therapy<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Antineoplastic-Agents,-Combined-therapeutic-use;Beckwith-Wiedemann-Syndrome-complications; Chemotherapy,-Adjuvant;Child,-Preschool; Kidney-Neoplasms-complications;Neoplasms,-Multiple-Primary-complications;Neoplasms,-Multiple-Primary-pathology; Nephrectomy-methods;Nephroblastoma-complications<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Female; Human<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  therapeutic-use; complications; pathology; therapy; methods<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  0<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  Antineoplastic-Agents,-Combined<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  97288408<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 42 of 66 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part A<p>TITLE:  The Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome phenotype and the risk of cancer.<p>AUTHOR:  Schneid,-H; Vazquez,-M-P; Vacher,-C; Gourmelen,-M; Cabrol,-S;Le-Bouc,-Y<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Laboratoire d'Explorations Fonctionnelles Endocriniennes,Hopital Annand-Trousseau, Paris, France.<p>SOURCE:  Med-Pediatr-Oncol. 1997 Jun; 28(6): 411-5<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0098-1532<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) comprises of a number of childhoodabnormalities, often associated with one or more tumors.

Commoncomplications reported with this procedure include pain tract infections,angulation deformities, joint contractures, and residual limb lengthdiscrepancies. Growth arrest or severe growth retardation in the lengthenedbones has rarely been reported. We report a case of a skeletally immaturepatient with right sided hemihypertrophy who underwent lengthening of the leftlower extremity by the method of DeBastiani using Orthofix external fixators.Postoperatively he developed severe growth retardation in the lengthened limb,as evidenced by the Mosely straight line graph, and recurrence of his limblength discrepancy. The reason for this growth retardation remains unknown;however, we hypothesize that premature closure at one or more of the physesoccurred because of increased tension across the growth plates. The practice ofover-lengthening a congenitally short limb prior to physeal closure should bequestioned because resumption of growth after lengthening may beunpredictable.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Bone-Lengthening-adverse-effects;*Growth-Disorders-etiology; *Leg-growth-and-development;*Leg-Length-Inequality-surgery<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Age-Determination-by-Skeleton;External-Fixators<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  adverse-effects; etiology; growth-and-development; surgery<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  97275409<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 45 of 66 in MEDLINE (R) 1996<p>TITLE:  Acquired tracheomalacia--a case report.<p>AUTHOR:  Kang,-F-C; Tsai,-Y-C; Jiang,-C-Y; Chen,-H-P; Chang,-C-L<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Anesthesiology, National Cheng KungUniversity, College of Medicine, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C.<p>SOURCE:  Acta-Anaesthesiol-Sin. 1996 Dec; 34(4): 239-42<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0529-5769<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1996<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  TAIWAN<p>ABSTRACT:  Tracheomalacia is a condition characterized by weakness of thetracheal walls and supporting cartilage.

There is a strikingincidence of childhood tumors found in BWS patients. Various lines ofinvestigation have localized "imprinted" genes involved in BWS and associatedchildhood tumors to 11p15. High resolution mapping of 8 rare balancedchromosomal BWS rearrangements enabled us to identify three distinct regions onchromosome 11p15 that might harbor genes involved in the above-mentioneddisorders. These results suggest genetic heterogeneity that correlates with theclinical heterogeneity seen in the patients studied. Expressed candidate genesequences from these regions have been cloned and partly sequenced. Thesetranscripts are either disrupted by or are at least within a few kb of theseBWS chromosome breakpoints. So far, zinc-finger sequences and oneKruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain were found in independent candidate geneswhich are compatible with a regulating function of growth promoting genes. Theabundance of expression of these genes varies from low abundant in all adultand fetal tissues tested to detectable on Northern blots of adult tissues. Inaddition to our 11p15 studies we have analyzed additional chromosome regions,in particular 1p. Cytogenetic, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and comparativegenomic hybridization (CGH) studies have identified 1p35 as a region ofinterest. A positional cloning effort to identify a balanced 1p35 translocationfound in a Wilms tumor has led to the isolation of a YAC, crossing thisbreakpoint.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Beckwith-Wiedemann-Syndrome-genetics;*Cloning,-Molecular; *Growth-Disorders-genetics; *Neoplasms-genetics<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adult-; Base-Sequence; Child-; Chromosome-Mapping;Chromosomes,-Human,-Pair-11-genetics; Gene-Deletion;Gene-Expression-Regulation; Gene-Rearrangement; Genomic-Imprinting-genetics;Growth-genetics; Heterozygote-; Transcription,-Genetic-genetics;Zinc-Fingers-genetics<p>CHECKTAGS:  Human; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article; Review; Review,-Tutorial<p>SUBHEADINGS:  genetics<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  96424618<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 51 of 66 in MEDLINE (R) 1996<p>TITLE:  Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome with hemimegalencephaly.

The findings in this patient support the conceptthat multiple focal nodular hyperplasia characteristically occurs in asyndromic form and is induced by an irregular arterial supply in the liver,with localized hyperfusion that leads to nodular areas of hepatocytehyperproliferation.<p>COMMENTS:  Comment In: Gastroenterology. 1999 Jul;117(1):284-5<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Arteriovenous-Malformations-complications;*Bone-and-Bones-pathology; *Hepatic-Artery-abnormalities;*Hepatic-Veins-abnormalities; *Liver-pathology; *Muscles-pathology<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adult-; Hyperplasia-; Hypertrophy-;Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber-Syndrome-complications; Liver-blood-supply<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Female; Human; Support,-U.S.-Gov't,-P.H.S.<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  complications; pathology; abnormalities; blood-supply<p>CONTRACT OR GRANT NUMBERS:  P30DK34989DKNIDDK<p>SUBSET:  Abridged-Index-Medicus; Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  95212848<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 53 of 66 in MEDLINE (R) 1995<p>TITLE:  A constitutional BWS-related t(11;16) chromosome translocationoccurring in the same region of chromosome 16 implicated in Wilms' tumors.<p>AUTHOR:  Newsham,-I; Kindler-Rohrborn,-A; Daub,-D; Cavenee,-W<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Section of Human Carcinogenesis, Ludwig Institute forCancer Research, La Jolla, CA 92093-0660.<p>SOURCE:  Genes-Chromosomes-Cancer. 1995 Jan; 12(1): 1-7<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  1045-2257<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1995<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a congenital overgrowthdisorder with a varying spectrum of clinical manifestations includingmacroglossia, omphalocele, hemihypertrophy, and a predisposition to a subset ofembryonal tumors, most frequently Wilms' tumor (WT). A variety of cytogenetic,genetic linkage, and molecular mapping data implicate a gene or genes onchromosome band 11p15.5 in BWS and its related tumors. However, some familieswith BWS do not show linkage to 11p15, and other alterations have been found inWilms' tumors as well. One such alteration is loss of heterozygosity (LOH) forchromosome arm 16q. Here we have analyzed a balanced t(11;16)(p15;q13)chromosomal translocation associated with the BWS phenotype and mapped thebreakpoint positions for both chromosomes 11 and 16 by using somatic cellhybrids and polymorphic markers. The chromosome 11 breakpoint was found to liedistal to the D11S12 locus, but proximal to TH on 11p15.5, a region shownpreviously to contain other BWS-related chromosomal events. The chromosome 16breakpoint was distal to D16S290 in 16q13, but proximal to loci D16S265,D16S267, and D16S164 in band 16q21. This area encompasses the region of LOHoccurring through mitotic recombination in sporadic WT. This raises interestingpossibilities for the genetic and epigenetic involvement of both chromosomalregions (11p15 and 16q13) in the pathogenesis of BWS and Wilms' tumor.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Beckwith-Wiedemann-Syndrome-genetics;*Chromosomes,-Human,-Pair-16; *Genes,-Wilms-Tumor-genetics;*Kidney-Neoplasms-genetics; *Nephroblastoma-genetics; *Translocation-Genetics<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adult-; Chromosome-Deletion; Chromosome-Mapping;Chromosomes,-Human,-Pair-11; DNA,-Neoplasm-analysis; Heterozygote-<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  genetics; analysis<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  0<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  DNA,-Neoplasm<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  95194917<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 54 of 66 in MEDLINE (R) 1995<p>TITLE:  Hepatoblastoma associated with congenital hemihypertrophy.<p>AUTHOR:  Rattan,-K-N; Sharma,-A; Singh,-Y; Ahlawat,-K; Mathur,-S-K; Marwah,-N<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Pediatrics Surgery, Pt.

In recent years,clinical evaluation of high-risk individuals has been greatly refined andsensible screening protocols have been proposed. A continued effort toclinically characterize the Wilms tumor syndromes continues to be important,and a patient registry is currently being generated by one of the authors (CC).This registry will prospectively assess the occurrence of Wilms tumor inpatients with high-risk phenotypes. All interested clinicians are encouraged toenroll their patients. As molecular genetic technologies refine our knowledgeof factors leading to Wilms tumor, improved mechanisms of surveillance inhigh-risk individuals will be developed. Recent characterization of molecularmechanisms responsible for cases of BWS, isolated hemihypertrophy, DDS,familial Wilms tumor, and aniridia has already influenced the clinicalmanagement of high-risk patients and has become an important adjunct toclinical assessment in these patients. The involvement of clinical genetics inthe coordination of clinical assessment, genetic testing, and tumorsurveillance will provide better patient care and will promote the developmentof a multidisciplinary approach to Wilms tumor risk assessment. Thiscollaboration between clinical genetics, molecular biology, oncology, andpediatrics should allow for a more precise understanding of tumor risks andwill accelerate the understanding of factors involved in the genesis andprogression of Wilms tumor.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Kidney-Neoplasms-diagnosis; *Mass-Screening-methods;*Nephroblastoma-diagnosis<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Kidney-Neoplasms-genetics; Nephroblastoma-genetics;Phenotype-; Risk-Factors; Syndrome-<p>CHECKTAGS:  Human<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article; Review; Review,-Tutorial<p>SUBHEADINGS:  diagnosis; genetics; methods<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  96159542<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 58 of 66 in MEDLINE (R) 1995<p>TITLE:  Nevus depigmentosus associated with hemihypertrophy of the limbs.<p>AUTHOR:  Dawn,-G; Dhar,-S; Handa,-S; Kanwar,-A-J<p>SOURCE:  Pediatr-Dermatol. 1995 Sep; 12(3): 286-7<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0736-8046<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1995<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Extremities-abnormalities; *Nevus-congenital;*Skin-Neoplasms-congenital<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Ear,-External-abnormalities; Hypertrophy-etiology;Infant-; Nevus-complications; Skin-Neoplasms-complications<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Letter<p>SUBHEADINGS:  abnormalities; etiology; complications; congenital<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  96100613<p>Record 59 of 66 in MEDLINE (R) 1995<p>TITLE:  Right upper limb bud triplication and polythelia, left sidedhemihypertrophy and congenital hip dislocation, facial dysmorphism, congenitalheart disease, and scoliosis: disorganisation-like spectrum or patterning genedefect?<p>AUTHOR:  Sabry,-M-A; al-Saleh,-Q; al-Saw'an,-R; al-Awadi,-S-A; Farag,-T-I<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Kuwait Medical Genetics Centre, Sulibikhat.<p>SOURCE:  J-Med-Genet. 1995 Jul; 32(7): 555-6<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0022-2593<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1995<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  ENGLAND<p>ABSTRACT:  A Somali female baby with right upper limb triplication, polythelia,left sided hemihypertrophy, congenital hip dislocation, facial dysmorphism,congenital heart disease, and scoliosis is described.

Of the 1,622 Wilms' tumour patientsregistered with the National Childhood Cancer Registry from 1971 to 1991, 41were recorded as having A, BWS or HH. Twenty-eight of these had their anomalydiagnosed before the WT and 13 had screening procedures carried out, mainlyabdominal ultrasound. In 8 patients the screening procedure detected the WT.There was no significant difference in stage distribution or outcome for any ofthe three subgroups who were not screened, screen-positive or screen-negative.We conclude that regular screening with abdominal ultrasound is not of provenvalue. Parents should be taught abdominal palpation and advised to seekappropriate advice for untoward symptoms.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Aniridia-complications;*Beckwith-Wiedemann-Syndrome-complications; *Kidney-Neoplasms-diagnosis;*Nephroblastoma-diagnosis<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Child-; Hypertrophy-; Kidney-Neoplasms-complications;Mass-Screening; Nephroblastoma-complications; Nephroblastoma-pathology;Questionnaires-; Retrospective-Studies<p>CHECKTAGS:  Human; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  complications; diagnosis; pathology<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  95214553<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><hR><A href="mailto:pietsch@indiana.edu"><B>web contact:</B> pietsch@indiana.edu</A><br><A HREF="home.html">return to the ShuffleBrain main menu</A></body></html>
