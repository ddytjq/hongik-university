Return of the 1979 Chrysler Newport (1998)
<BR>
225 c.i. slant 6  - Free Car
<BR>
After derbying the car once, it was still running good, but slightly smashed up.
<br>
The passengers side was caved in about a foot. It even bent the bench seat.
<br>
The rear end also took a quite a beating.
<br>
The bumper/bumper shocks bent down, while the leaf springs were actually bending up.
<br>
In the derby, the car ran fine, but got high centered in the logs.
<br>
Very little additiona damage was done.
<br>
I was dissapointed and sold the car for $30.00, instead of taking <br>
it home and storing it for 9 months.
