HTML=<H2>World's 2 on 2</H2><P>	(Midland, MI) -- It was a weekend of rapidly changing weather conditionsaccompanied by a big change at the top of the Guts Frisbee world.  Insomething of an upset, the team of Steve Trauger and Roger Hill defeatedCupola Bandits John Begoske and Dave Young to take top honors at the World Two-On-Two GutsChampionship.  The tournament was the first stop on the new Pro GutsCircuit, intended to pump new life into a somewhat fading sport.<P>	Six teams started play Saturday morning, using a round-robin format, butthe team of Art McGuff (tournament director) and Steve Buckley, afterwinning their first game in a big come-from-behind victory, was forced tobow out when McGuff severely injured his right ankle on a scoring shot intheir second game.  That left five teams: Begoske and Young, Trauger andHill, Duane Haralson and Ron Arvo, Will Sirrine and Dan Thornton, and RickLaRue and Ron Blau (in his last Midwest tournament before departing forConnecticut).  Everyone enjoyed the 82 degree temperatures and sunny skieson Saturday--with the possible exception of McGuff, who spent most of theafternoon at a local hospital.<P>	On Sunday, a double-elimination format was used, with Trauger and Hillstarting the day with the top seed.  It was cold, overcast, and misty whenthe first games were played at 10:30, but finally improved toward themiddle of the afternoon when Begoske and Young eliminated LaRue and Blau inthe finals of the loser's bracket.  Occasional gusty winds meant limitedcatching, so wild throws were once again a major factor in the later games.<P>	Local public access channel MCTV set up two cameras before the finals, andArt McGuff set aside his crutches long enough to do play by play, joined byWill Sirrine adding color commentary.  Begoske and Young had alreadysuffered a defeat at the hands of Trauger and Hill.  This meant they neededtwo straight wins under the true double-elimination format to capture thetournament.  They started out strong and kept rolling to victory in thefirst game, fueled by great catching and extremely hard, well-placed shots.<P>	It was a different story in the second game, however, as Trauger and Hillbuckled down and jumped out to an early 7-4 lead.  Begoske and Young eachdropped routine tips, and never really threatened until 19-17.  Dave Youngwas hoping to pull his team within 1, but instead pushed his lefty backhanda foot wide to the right of Steve Trauger.  Roger Hill was up to the taskand delivered the game-winning shot.  He and Trauger share $400 first-placemoney for their efforts, along with the honor of adding their names to theGPA World Championship "Jumbo Jug" trophy.<P>	Following the Allentown, PA, tourney on June 15th and 16th, the next majortournament is the 39th Annual IFT, July 6th and 7th in Hancock, MI.  Afterdropping last year's IFT finals and now the World's, we can expect thelong-time Cupola players to come back tougher than ever.<P><H3>Dan Thornton dthornto@usa.pipeline.com</H3>
