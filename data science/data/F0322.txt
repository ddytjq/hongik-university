This set of Web pages have been designed as a quick introduction to Visual Basic. The aim is to get readers up and over the first step of the learning curve to a position where they have enough knowledge to start learning by experimentation.
<P>
To achieve this objective, this series of pages are divided into three sections (respresented by three sets of frames).
<UL COMPACT>
<LI><A HREF="lt1-toc.htm"TARGET="toc">The first section</A> provides a brief introduction to the Visual Basic interface. 
<LI><A HREF="lt2-toc.htm"TARGET="toc">The second section</A> provides an introduction to the main features of the BASIC programming language and provides some general information on how best to write programs in Visual Basic.
<LI><A HREF="lt3-toc.htm"TARGET="toc">The third section</A> provides a brief introduction into using someof the graphical functions provided by the Windows API.
<LI><A HREF="ex-toc.htm"TARGET="toc">The fourth section</A> provides a list of exercises which progressively illustrate the features of both the BASIC language and the Visual Basic interface. Each of these exercises provides examples how to code in Quick BASIC and how that code is implemented in Visual Basic.
