<u>Solar Properties</u></font>
<p>
Throughout history, humans have been aware of the importance of the 
Sun for life on Earth. Solar energy is transformed by plants
into chemical energy, the first step in the food chain for all 
living things. Modern humans use energy from the Sun as a clean,
inexpensive source of power. And, sunlight and solar magnetic 
activity affect the Earth's climate. The sun's unique importance is, 
however, one of proximity - it is in all respects a very middle class 
star.

photosphere</a>.  The photosphere has a depth less than 500km (compared with 
the rest of the sun it is thinner than the skin of an onion).  The temperature 
ranges from about 4500 K at the top of the solar atmosphere to 7500 K at the 
base.  This region is where the 
<a href="http://www.coseti.org/highspec.htm">solar absorption spectrum</a>
is produced; the photosphere effectively acts as a blanket of cooler gas
which absorbs and re-emits radiation from the warmer regions below.

Sunspots</a> are cooler regions in the solar photosphere where the 
temperature may drop to a frigid 4000K.  Magnetic studies of the sun show that 
these are also regions of very high magnetic fields, up to 1000 times stronger 
than the regular magnetic field.  
<p>
Sunspots follow an 11 year cycle of formation that represents the cyclic 
variation in solar activity. The number of sunspots increases from zero at 
solar minimum, to over 100 at solar maximum, 5 1/2 years later. The position 
of the sunspots is not random. They first appear in the middle latitudes above 
and below the Sun's equator. As solar activity increases, the bands of 
sunspots widen and move toward the equator. The plot on the right below, 
known as a "butterfly diagram", shows the number and position of sunspots over 
time.</b></td><td align="right">

granulation</a>.  Granuales are small structures approximately 1000 km 
across that cover the entire solar surface, except for the sunspot regions. 
They are the tops of deep gas columns where energy is transported by 
<a href="http://www.hawastsoc.org/solar/eng/edu/convect.htm">convection</a>. 
Hot gases from the the solar interior expand upward, spreading out and 
cooling. The cool gas sinks back into the Sun, to be reheated and repeat 
the process. Spectra of the centers of the <i>granules</i> shows these 
regions to be a few hundred Kelvin hotter than the surrounding darker 
lanes. Individual granuales last for about 20 minutes. The gas within them 
can reach speeds of 7 km/sec (15,000 mph), faster than the speed of sound 
in air.</td><td><img src="./images/solar_system/sun_granules.gif"></td></table>

The <i>chromosphere</i> is the region above the photosphere.  It has a

with the photosphere to several hundred thousand K at the upper boundary.
(These boundaries are not well defined and the numbers cited for the
thickness and temperature may vary.)  The chromosphere is much fainter than
the photosphere and is only visible during solar eclipses, when it can be
seen as a pink flash with accompanying emission line spectrum.

Solar Flares</a></a></font>
<p>
<i>Solar flares</i> are explosive events on the solar surface characterized by
intense brightening of regions of the solar atmosphere in x-rays, ultraviolet 
and visible light over periods of a few minutes, then fading over a period of 
an hour or so.  During a flare high energy particles are ejected into the 
corona, heating regions to temperatures in excess of 5 million K.  A flare may 
release an amount of energy equivalent to 100 million "hydrogen" (fusion) 
bombs.

Coronal Mass Ejections</font></u></a>
<p>
The invention of the coronograph prompted the discovery of a solar
phenomenon never before observed from Earth. A coronograph creates an
artificial eclipse by covering the bright disk of the sun allowing study
of the corona. Periodically, a huge cloud of
gas with frozen-in magnetic field lines is ejected from the Sun over 
several hours. These clouds are called <i>coronal mass ejections</i> or
CME's. They are sometimes associated with flares or prominences, but
also occur alone. The number of CME's varies with the solar cycle, going
from about 1 a day at solar minimum, up to 2 or 3 per day at solar maximum.
CME's, like flares, disrupt the flow of the solar wind, and can cause
wide-spread damage on Earth. Research is ongoing to understand the way in
which CME's form, with the hope of being able to predict them. <i>Space 
weather</i> is of interest to communications and power companies, as well 
as the military. If CME's could be anticipated, it would be possible to 
shut-down satellites and minimize damage.  Here is an 
<a href="./images/anim/cme.mpg">MPEG animation</a> of a coronal mass ejection.

<font size=+1 color="burgundy"><u>
The Solar Magnetic Field</font></u><p>

The source of the sun's activity is believed to be the 
<a href="http://solar.physics.montana.edu/YPOP/Spotlight/Magnetic/index.html">
Solar Magnetic Field</a> which can be seen in this
<a href="http://www.ssl.msfc.nasa.gov/ssl/pad/solar/3dfields.htm">3-D 
visualization</a>.  The magnetic field structure of the Sun is very
complex.  Field lines are dragged and twisted by the Sun's differential
rotation. Because the Sun is gaseous it does not rotate uniformly: the 
equator rotates more rapidly (25 days) than the polar regions (~30 days). 
Magnetic field lines near the surface inhibit convection and produce
sunspots.  When field lines shear,cross and reconnect, the huge amount of
energy released heats the surrounding gas to millions of degrees, creating
solar flares.  The 11 year solar cycle is believed to be a cycle of
twisting and reorganization of the magnteic field.

<font size=+1 color="burgundy"><u>
Solar Phenomena on Other Stars</font></u>
<p>
If the sun is an "average" star it is reasonable to expect that solar-type 
phenomena occur in other stars.  Although the sun's activity is quite
spectacular to us, such activity is completely undetectable even on the 
nearest stars.  But many solar phenomena exhibit themselve in grander 
fashion elsewhere.  
<ul>
<li><i><u>Chromospheres</i></u>: Many young, cools stars (especially M-stars) 
exhibit evidence of very strong chromospheric activity in the form of 
emission-line cores to their absorption features. (Remember the solar 
chromospheric emission spectrum is only visible during eclipses.)

<li><i><u>Flares</i></u>: Flare Stars are stars which show eruptions like solar 
flares, but which may cause the light of the star to increase by a factor of 
several and cover a large fraction of the stellar surface.

<li><i><u>Starspots</i></u>: RS Canum Venaticorum and BY Draconis stars 
(named after the prototype stars) are F/G and K/M stars respectively that
show variability attributed to stellar rotation in which starspots covering 
a significant fraction of the stellar surface rotate in and out of the field 
of view.

<li><i><u>Magnetic Fields</i></u>: Current techniques do not permit detection 
of magnetic fields as weak as the solar field in other stars, but there are 
<i>magnetic stars</i> which have magnetic fields up to several thousand gauss
(<i>i.e.</i> several thousand times that of the sun).
</ul>
