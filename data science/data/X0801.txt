              Proper Habits</small></small></font></h3>
              <p><small><small><i>Basketball Scoring</i> is the second video in
              the Advanced Basketball Skills series by Don Meyer and Jerry
              Krause.&nbsp; It continues on with the general theme of the series
              of teaching players through proper understanding of learning
              methodology, an ample supply of drills, and an emphasis on body
              balance and control in their execution.&nbsp; There are a number
              of well received shooting videos on the market that teach basic
              shooting technique and what types of shot to work on.&nbsp; This
              video takes a broader tact instead looking at the shot as only
              part of becoming a scorer.&nbsp; The video opens with a seven
              minute learning methods segment by Coach Don Meyer the same as
              found in the opening of each of the videos in the Advanced
              Basketball Skills series.</small></small></p>
              <p><small><small>Jerry Krause, longtime Head Coach, and now
              Assistant at Gonzaga, takes over at this point in the video and
              takes you through the fundamentals of the lay-up including the
              important <img border="0" src="../../../../images/Reviews/a_quality_shot_means.gif" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5">technique
              of &quot;pitting and protecting&quot; the ball as you approach the
              basket against a closing defender.&nbsp; The second phase of this
              teaching segment covers four types of lay-ups including the basic
              dribble lay-up, the hook or reverse lay-up, the power lay-up and
              shooting a lay-up in transition off the pass.&nbsp; The segment
              closes with six lay-up drills you can practice out of line
              progressions which we feel would be very useful for youth coaches
              and developing players.&nbsp; If you have ever asked yourself, how
              to you properly teach the lay-up, this video will meet that
              need.&nbsp; The drills include the basic one-step lay-up, getting
              your footwork down into the lay-up with running steps, lay-ups off
              the dribble and pass, and the V-Cut and square up footwork as a
              counter when the defense takes away the basket.&nbsp; In addition
              the last drill introduced by Don Meyer shows the many variations
              of the well known Mikan Drill.</small></small></p>
              <h3><font color="#FF8000" size="1">Get the Best Possible Shot</font></h3>
              <p><small><small>Following the basics on the lay-up Coach Meyer
              proceeds to introduce shot basics including the well known BEEF
              principle (used by many successful coaches including <a href="../cd_roms/lwilkenslegacy.asp">Lenny
              Wilkens</a> and <a href="tvanderveer_review_vol1-3.asp">Tara
              VanDerveer</a>).&nbsp; One of the things we like about Coach
              Meyer's methods however is that he is constantly adding great
              teaching keys along with the basics.&nbsp; In introducing the
              shooting segment of Basketball Scoring he notes that our goal any
              offense should be quality shots.&nbsp; Meaning, &quot;get the best
              possible shot every single time down the court.&quot;&nbsp; He
              also emphasizes the release point and not releasing at the awkward
              45 degree angle but rather at about 55-60 degrees to increase your
              shooting percentages.&nbsp; From there you are given a short but
              very solid teaching progression for shooting backboard
              shots.&nbsp; Everyone who has played or coached the game knows
              that you want to kiss the glass in the upper right corner of the
              rectangle on the downward flight of the ball to make a bank
              shot.&nbsp; But he emphasizes this point to players by saying that
              failure to do this will make your shot off the glass like a
              &quot;rock skipping off the water.&quot;&nbsp; His colorful use of
              this type of imagery in teaching basketball skills is what makes
              Don Meyer a coach's coach.</small></small></p>
              <h3><font color="#FF8000" size="1">Shot Preparation and Becoming a
              ROBOT Scorer</font></h3>
              <p><small><small>About this time in most shooting videos you jump
              from the shot technique directly to specific shot locations and
              moves.&nbsp; The problem with that approach is too many young
              players miss a key element of developing proper basketball scoring
              habits.&nbsp; The question of when do you take <img border="0" src="../../../../images/Reviews/get_a_GO_TO_move.gif" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">a
              shot.&nbsp; To address that problem Coach Meyer teaches you the
              ROBOT method which stands for Range, Open, Balance, One-Count
              Shot, and Team Shot.&nbsp; Without giving away all his tips it is
              suffice to say he is direct on target in demonstrating the
              importance of staying within your natural shooting range, taking
              uncontested shots when possible, making your shot compact and
              efficient not wasting motion with a quick release, and taking
              shots within your team's system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></small></p>
              <p><small><small>Once you have a good sense of what to teach your
              players in terms of when to take shots Coach Meyer moves on to
              getting a player prepared to shoot by proper hand and
              footwork.&nbsp; Here he addresses things like giving the passer a
              target where you want to receive the pass every time,&nbsp; being
              ready to shoot fast, but not rushing the shot, and the importance
              of gripping the ball properly on the catch (with a V between the
              thumb and forefinger) which gives you the best feel on the </small></small><small><small>finger pads</small></small><small><small>
              prior to release.&nbsp; The significance of a cocked wrist is also
              addressed in this teaching progression on shot preparation.</small></small></p>
              <h3><font color="#FF8000" size="1">Grooving Your Shot and
              Extending Your Range</font></h3>
              <p><small><small>Now that we have a good sense of how prepare to
              shoot, take the shot, and know when to shoot we are passed on to a
              progression for improving both shooting range, grooving your shot,
              and working on penetration and pitch technique.&nbsp; This is an
              excellent 6 drill shooting progression to give your players as a
              daily warm-up or for them to take off the court when they are
              practicing on their own.</small></small></p>
              <p><small><small>Two more areas of scoring are covered as the
              Basketball Scoring video winds to a close.&nbsp; About 15 minutes
              of the video is devoted to a post shooting progression.&nbsp;
              Coach Meyer emphasizes the importance of keeping the total number
              of post moves to a minimum and getting a &quot;go to move&quot;
              which he describes as one where &quot;everyone in the gym knows
              you will <img border="0" src="../../../../images/Reviews/practice_habits_are_very_critical.gif" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5">take
              this shot and you can still make it.&quot;&nbsp; Over the last
              20-30 years in coaching methodology we are seeing more coaches
              moving away from having 5 or 6 post moves and towards 3 or 4 moves
              at the most.&nbsp; There are very good teaching segments on the
              power shot, jump hook, and crab move with an emphasis in the
              drills on extending the power and range from the basket from which
              the post player can successfully initiate their moves.&nbsp;
              Coaches Meyer and Krause both place a great deal of emphasis on
              positioning of the feet (&quot;point the toes to the baseline on
              any power move to better protect the ball, more likely draw a
              foul, and not get your shot blocked.&quot;).&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></small></p>
              <h3><small><small><font color="#FF8000">Free Throw Practice Habits</font></small></small></h3>
              <p><small><small>This video concludes with Jerry Krause giving us
              one of the better free throw teaching segments we have seen.&nbsp;
              He talks about the importance of &quot;practice habits being very
              critical to in game free throw success.&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Coach
              Krause speaks on both the physical and mental aspects of foul
              shooting and demonstrate several good drills for grooving your
              free throw shot at the start of practice each day.&nbsp; He
              demonstrates as well five steps to developing a proper sequence in
              stepping up to knock down those free throws focused on using the
              same shooting ritual, and the importance of breathing and relaxing
              as part of those steps.&nbsp; This free throw segment also talks
              about how to develop free throw shooting in younger players by
              both adjusting for distance and basket height and for teaching
              players at an early age to pull the guide hand off the ball when
              you are attempting to gain confidence in shooting and grooving
              this shot.</small></small></p>
              <h3><font color="#FF8000" size="1">Summary</font></h3>
              <p><small><small>Basketball Scoring does have many elements a good
              coach will recognize as important tools in shooting and
              scoring.&nbsp; What we think it does a bit different is that it
              goes outside the normally boundaries of most shooting videos and
              is a bit more comprehensive in covering various aspects of scoring
              independent of position.&nbsp; It tweaks your interest in
              reviewing your own methods for teaching scoring skills and will
              certainly add some additional ideas to improving your player
              getting quality shots and being able to convert them when it
              counts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></small></p>
              <p><small><small>You can find other &quot;shooting video's&quot;
              that will provide you much more detail about actual shot
              mechanics, although this one is more than adequate with regards to
              shooting skills.&nbsp; But most of them fall short when it comes
              to teaching a young player other fundamental elements of scoring
              which is where <i>Basketball Scoring</i> excels.&nbsp; We give it
              4 hoops out of 5 and feel that it's content hold true to the
              broader goal of this series of teaching body balance and quickness
              throughout all the drills and demonstrations.&nbsp; It is a video
              which can expand your thinking on shooting and scoring concepts if
              you feel your &quot;teaching well is running a bit dry.&quot;</small></small></p>
