    Adelaide Stakes 1000m</strong></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Orrong,
    Flawed Logic, Ivory Bird and Rachael's Pride raced forward early as Presumed Innocent
    settled back from the outside barrier. By this stage racegoers near the finish had noticed
    a family of ducks wander out on the track at the winning post. At the turn Orrong led
    narrowly from Ivory Bird with Rachael's Pride three wide followed by Flawed Logic and Red
    Labelle with Defiant wider. The ducks, two adults and nine ducklings, were now three
    quarters of the way across to the outside rail and there was nothing anyone close could do
    about the unfolding situation. By the 200m Orrong was clear of Ivory Bird as Red Labelle
    found a clear run with We Will Rock You blocked on the rails as Westace started to run on
    with Presumed Innocent extremely wide on the track. The ducks began to slowly head back
    towards the inside rail but were still unaware of the approach of 15 2yo racehorses.
    Inside the final 100m Red Labelle went to the front from Westace then Orrong on the rails,
    Defiant wide and Presumed Innocent very wide. Westace made a determined bid with Presumed
    Innocent but Red Labelle was holding them until she caught sight of the ducks. With 20m to
    go Red Labelle pricked her ears, propped for three strides though still in front before
    jumping the group of ducklings crossing her path. Meanwhile Westace and Presumed Innocent
    were wide enough to miss the group with Westace winning by a half head from Presumed
    Innocent with a nose to Red Labelle, just landing from her leap, third. Chocko back in the
    field also hurdled the group of ducklings including the adult. As the horses approached
    one adult had tried to stand between the horses (notably Red Labelle) and ducklings as the
    other took off for the safety of the inside. Despite one duckling dropping to the ground
    as the backmarkers went past all ducks and ducklings popped up and headed for the winning
    post unharmed only turning back with an expression of bewilderment. There is reportedly
    two families of ducks living at the pond behind the winning post area and though
    occasionally seen and even wandering out after a race the ducks have never threatened a
    race in the past.</font></p>

    from Garters and was ridden by David Tootell. He is trained by Len Smith for MM Smith, I
    Davies, AJ Grayling, V King and P &amp; E Dickman. Westace was sold through the Adelaide
    Magic Millions Summer Sale and this was his second race start after a close third a
    fortnight ago.</font></td>
