<p>My introduction to big telescopes came on Kitt Peak, when Dan Weedman 
brought me along
for galaxy photometry in June 1977 (the same week that Star Wars opened for 
the first time). After doing some narrowband imaging at the 2.1m as part of my 
thesis work, I spent three years as a Kitt Peak (later NOAO) postdoc.</p>

<p> There is a

The original (#1) 0.9m at Kitt Peak was demolished to make room for the 3.5m 
WIYN telescope,  
with the best components of both 0.9-m telescopes going into a single new 
"Frankenscope" (whose days are now numbered according to the latest
NOAO budgetary plan). The wide field of the 0.9m and an unusually extensive suite 
of instruments and detectors allowed some unique studies (this picture shows
the telescope with the NOAO large-format CCD mosaic imager in place, a
pretty remarkable thing for a telescope of this size). I once spent 6 
nights trying to 
measure the spectra of reflection nebulae here, with the idea of seeing whether
the diffuse interstellar bands could be shown to either occur or not occur 
within the nebulae. Being July in Tucson, I got about 3 hours' worth of data 
and took this as a sign that I should stay outside the galaxy. Even so, the 
data on NGC XXXX do show reflected stellar absorption features from the dust.
This picture shows the dome of the composite 0.9m, in its latest incarnation 
after the extensive air vents were added to improve the airflow and seeing.</p>

<p>My first KPNO experience involved UBV photometry of galaxy nuclei as a 
supplement to the survey Dan Weeman and I had been doing with photography from  
Dyer Observatory. At that point, a teletype right on the observing platform 
printing out the photon counts for each integration was the coolest piece of 
apparatus I'd ever seen. We generated this UBV two color diagram 
<a href="ubvnuclei.gif"> <img src="ubvnuclei.gif" align=right alt=
"UBV diagram for galactic nuclei" height=358 width=307></a>for
galactic nuclei, where the upper curve shows where Seyfert nuclei
would fall and the lower one compares the loci of individual star clusters.
Later, Peter Allan and I used the 1.3m for precise 
photometric monitoring of quasar variability (just lately turned into the 
Master's thesis of Jose Maria Castro Ceron). 
For this project, we made optical use of 
an infrared-optimized feature of the telescope - a rapidly chopping secondary mirror 
which let us accumulate sky and object measures several times a second. These 
results are nicely summarized in the structure function, showing the amount of 
variation as a function of time (in the quasars' time frames, that is, 
correcting for the apparent time dilation due to their redshift). Shortly 
before the telescope was decommissioned (both for financial reasons and
because competitive infrared instrumentation was physically outgrowing its size)
I did a near-infrared survey of interacting galaxies with Gene Byrd and Mario 
Klaric. Most notably, we did not find the incidence of hidden bars which some 
calculations had implicated in triggering star formation and AGN during tidal 
encounters between galaxies. Here are some sample 2.2-micron images of 
interacting galaxies.</p>

As so many other astronomers have found, this telescope has been a real 
workhorse for large-scale programs, for imaging and spectroscopy alike. The
dome is shown here in front of Mars, Jupiter and Saturn during the spectacular 
alignment of June 1995 (yes, for my fellow pedants out there, that's four planets
in one shot).
Both for 
my dissertation work and for a later study of galaxy interactions, I used it 
for H-alpha imaging of galaxies to trace how star formation and nuclear 
activity vary with galaxy type and tidal disturbance. Here I show a normal 
object - the beautifully outlined spiral pattern in NGC 5427 as seen in 
H-alpha - and an abnormal one - the strange loops and whorls of ionized gas in 
the radio source NGC 2655. In these displays, the color palette shows
varying intensities of emission from gaseous hydrogen (H-alpha) and nitrogen
(the adjacent [N II] lines). Such images can be used to measure the
space distribution and distribution in intensity of star-forming regions,
to seek clues to how galaxy interactions trigger enhanced star formation.

<p>Later on, I used its GoldCam optical spectrograph to 
measure rotation curves of samples of interacting spirals, both normal and 
Seyfert galaxies, seeking connections between AGN or star formation and these 
disturbances. As a sample, here is the rotation curve of the disturbed galaxy 
NGC 6621 (which looks correspondingly weird in both 
<a href="http://www.astr.ua.edu/gifimages/ngc6621r.html">groundbased data</a>
and in the HST images that
Kirk Borne and I just got).  The changing sizes of the (2-sigma) error
bars mostly reflect the changing intensity of H-alpha and [N II]
emission lines (shown at the bottom of the plot, which traces both
the continuum and emission-line intensity on an arbitrary scale along the slit).

Most recently, we used the 2.1m for 
optical and near-IR imaging of overlapping galaxies, to trace
the effects of dust absorption within galaxy disks, plus spectroscopy of these 
pairs which allows us to separate the contributions from each galaxy by their 
difference in redshift. I'll illustrate these with a
sample image of AM1316-241 (no big deal compared to the WFPC2 image we got 
later, but we couldn't have gotten those data without the ground-based survey), 
and the cross-correlation of the overlapping spectra of the components of 
NGC 3088 (UGC 5384), showing the signatures of light from both redshifts 
at the same location.</p>

<p> The 2.1m is also equipped with a separate feed telescope,
using a fixed primary and a moving flat feed mirror to feed light
from a 1m primary into the coude' spectrograph without having to
use the 2.1m itself. This was so successful that, after the
CFT was commissioned, the 2.1m was seldom used with the large
fixed spectrograph. This view, taken a few weeks before the
CFT was closed for budgetary reasons, shows the primary and
light-baffle tube, looking south toward Baboquivari and
Canopus. The flat mirror which controls the telescope's
pointing is visible at the left; it was pointed high in the south
during this picture. </p>

The Kitt Peak 4-meter telescope was long the crown jewel of the US national 
observatories. In scattered observing 
runs over the years, I've examined reported optical jets (they're mostly not), 
looked at the spectra of complex galactic nuclei at high dispersion, and joined 
the rush toward the epoch of galaxy formation. One particularly interesting 
(and tedious) kind of observation uses the DensePak fiber-optic array to map a 
14x14-arcsecond region spectroscopically, as seen in this Doppler map of the 
gaseous filaments in M87 (where color corresponds to radial velocity,
and red of corse to receding areas). I also show an H-alpha image of the 
filaments in NGC 1275, taken with the Cryogenic Camera in its rarely-used
imaging mode. </p>

<p> Lately, with Rogier Windhorst and crew, we've been 
using narrowband filters to map clustering at redshifts near z=2.4, dovetailing 
with fields observed using HST to combine its unique depth and detail with the 
wide field coverage afforded by the prime-focus cameras at the 4-meter 
telescope (which truth in advertising compels me to point out has a clear 
aperture closer to 3.8 meters). This field, a color composite starting from
B and I broadband images, shows known and new objects at 
redshift z close to 2.4 found in this way. The detected objects are circled,
and all appear in this subsection of the whole observed area. By now,
six are spectroscopically confirmed as AGN at this redshift. The redshift
and space distribution of the members indicates that we're seeing a group
or cluster in formation, falling together for the first time
as their mutual gravity overcomes the Hubble expansion.</p>

<p>This shiny new addition to the Kitt Peak landscape is a great demonstration
of the advances in telescope technology over the two decades since the Mayall
telescope went into service. It's compact, usually delivers sharper
images, and is reputed to take substantially less maintenance. 
WIYN stands for the project partners - Wisconsin, Indiana, Yale, and NOAO -
but kept an earlier pronunciation ("win"), no matter how
appropriate the current letters might seem. Alas,
I never got a picture of the footprints left on the primary mirror
by a ringtailed cat, so that story must remain anecdotal. The outside view
contrasts the angular, metallic enclosure, including pipes to carry warm
air away from the telescope, with the weathered rock
of Baboquivari Peak in the distant background. The telescope
picture shows the secondary mirror and lightweight support trusses, with
an altitude bearing and one of the spectrograph ports at right.
A particular specialty for WIYN has been multiobject spectroscopy,
using the Hydra fiber-optic bundle and positioners. For this, one
typically lets the data gathering be supervised by the telescope
operator and queue astronomer, so you need not make the trip for
a couple of hours' worth of data. We've used this for spectroscopic
surveys of distant clusters of galaxies in support of VLA and HST
projects, especially the merging cluster Abell 2125 which we've also
observed with the Mayall telescope (in regions so crowded with galaxies
that the Hydra fibers would collide with each other). More recently,
I've used the DensePak fiber-optic array to map the kinematics of
several interacting-galaxy systems (see the examples shown for
<a href="../research/ngc1410.html"> NGC 1409/10</a>).
</p>


<p> Still to come: from 36", H II spectrum, reflection nebula, mosaic image?
4m data on multiple objects in Abell 2125.
Observers at 4m.</p>
