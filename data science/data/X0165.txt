<B>MISSION STATEMENT</B>
<P>
Promote international tournament participation at all playing levels, and organize & fund the ALAN TOLERTON HOCKEY CAMP, an annual field hockey camp for young athletes from around the world.

Our foundation was created in summer of 1999, in memory of former Irish International <B>Alan Tolerton</B>, Irelands' most talented player of the 70's, following his sudden death in 1998, during his tenure as coach of Monkstown Hockey Club in Dublin.
<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC="alan.jpg" WIDTH="140" HEIGHT="196" ALT="Alan Tolerton" ALIGN="right" HSPACE="14">
Alan did more than just play hockey, he lived it day and night. He also managed
to pass on his passion to many youngsters, as throughout his career he
continuously helped them develop their skills and their love for the sport.  But
Alan was more than an extremely talented athlete, he was a man who always thought
of the well being of others before his own, on and off the field, and that made
him extremely popular with all the hockey players and fans privileged to have known
him.
<BR><BR>
With Alan's untimely departure, the main goal of the Field Hockey Foundation is
to pursue his work of developing the skills of others, by organizing and funding
an annual hockey camp for young athletes from around the world, to be known as
the <B>Alan Tolerton Hockey Camp</B>.  The camp will offer hockey players 10 - 16 years of
age many learning opportunities, such as to develop their individual athletic
skills, the rules &amp; regulations of the game as well as safety considerations, the
importance of "team playing" and many other topics.  Also, by interacting with
players from various parts of the globe, participants will also experience the
great joys and rewards of cultural exchange.  Surely after 10 - 15 days of such
interactions, those youngster will bring back to their respective countries and
cities the lessons they will have learned, and will undoubtedly pass on to other 
"young-athletes-to-be" their enthusiasm for a sport loved by so many, yet not
fully appreciated nor understood by the overall sporting community.
<BR><BR>
Of course, lots of planning needs to be done to get this foundation truly going
and many details must be worked out, but as we begin this new venture, the target
date for our first hockey camp is summer 2002. And although the venue for the
first Alan Tolerton Hockey Camp has not yet been determined, serious
consideration is given to bring this event to Lisburn, Alan's hometown. The
funding of the foundation's activities and camp will be provided through
sponsorship from corporations around the world, the <A HREF="store/order_form.html">sale of hockey related products</A> & various other fundraising activities.  And although financial
contribution is needed to achieve our goal, the donations we will be seeking from
businesses, clubs, players and fans, as well as local government bodies, hockey
associations and the press, need not always be in cold cash, they can come in
different shapes or forms such as time, advice, valuable contacts, coaching,
equipment and much more.
<BR><BR>
Finally, with as much energy as those currently involved in the Field Hockey
Foundation are already spending on this project, we cannot be successful without
valuable input and assistance of others.  So, if you truly love your sport and
wish to see it further develop and reach higher grounds, we urge you to join us in
our effort. We are looking for one or two people in each hockey playing country
to volunteer as our local point of contact. 
If you are interested in finding
out more about this, <A HREF="mailto:dgh@fieldhockeytournament.com"><B>email</B></A> us using "Volunteer" in the subject line and we will
send you the information.  Another way of helping, is for you players and fans to
just simply take the message of our mission to your clubs, schools, universities,
your local and national federations &amp; associations, and to all players and future
players. 
<BR><BR>
<B>The more people know about our goal, the more we can help in the
continued development of your favorite sport.</B>

Because we are at the very early stage of our project,
many issues still need to be addressed.  We have, however, prepared a few basic
questions/answers that will surely be on your mind.  As our work progresses, we
will continuously be updating this page with relevant information, so if the
hockey camp is of interest to you, keep checking back for new developments to
come.
<BR><BR>
<B>Who is eligible to participate in the Alan Tolerton Hockey camp?</B> Boys and girls
between 10 and 16 years of age, from any country, interested in developing their
hockey skills.
<BR><BR>
<B>How many children will attend the camp?</B> At the present time, we anticipate 2
children for each participating country.
<BR><BR>
<B>How do the children get selected?</B> This has not been fully determined but our plan
is to try and work closely with the various national federations/associations,
club presidents, and schools &amp; university coaches.  We hope to see each country
interested in participating make it's own selection of a number of local
children.  The process would take the following path: Families with children
interested in participating would speak with their own club officials, or school
coaches; the club officials and/or coaches would submit their requests to their
national federations/associations, who would make an initial selection according
to certain criterions.  The final selection would then be made through an
International Selection Committee  (ISC).  This ISC would be composed of various
hockey Internationals, as well as former Internationals and possibly other hockey
personalities and/or officials.   Keep in mind this is a planning stage only and
therefore very tentative.  All parties still need to come together to discuss
this process and hopefully agree to the final framework. We welcome any outside
ideas/opinions.
<BR><BR>
<B>How long will the children stay at the camp, when and where?</B> We are looking at
possibly a 10-15 day period, during the summer.  Our target date for our first
camp is Summer 2002, and although the site has not been selected yet, we hope to
be able to bring it to Ireland, where Alan played.  Realistically however,  many
factors will impact that decision and if Ireland is not feasible, we will be
looking at the USA.
<BR><BR>
<B>How much does it cost to participate in the camp?</B> The camp will be funded by the
foundation, no direct cost will be incurred by the families of the selected young
athletes.
