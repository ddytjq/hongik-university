<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="RichEdit20Monograph"></A> Using
Rich Edit 2.0 With BCB</H2>
<P>Rich Edit 2.0 is an updated version of the Rich Edit
  control.&nbsp; It includes additional features such as: 
</P> <UL>
<LI>Support for more Rich Text Format (RTF) codes (RTF
1.5?). </LI>
<LI>Multi-level undo/redo.&nbsp; You can ask the control
what is about to be undone/redone and display it for the
user. </LI>
<LI>Auto-URL detection -- automatically underlines and
highlights in blue text URL links such as text beginning
with &quot;http://', &quot;ftp://&quot;, etc.&nbsp; Your
program can be notified when the user clicks/double-clicks
on the text and, with just a little code, start the user's
browser and link to the URL. </LI>
<LI>Additional visual character formatting using an
extended version of the CHARFORMAT structure (CHARFORMAT2)
that supports:&nbsp; User-defined character background
colors; strike-out character format; super- and subscripted
text; a second functional underline style (dotted); and the
ability to show revisions by different authors in different
colors. </LI>
<LI>Additional non-visual character formatting using
CHARFORMAT2 that supports a &quot;link&quot; format that
notifies the parent control of mouse movements over the
text.&nbsp; Although this is probably used to support the
Auto-URL detection mentioned above, you could use it to get
notification when the cursor moves over or is clicked on
your own special text. </LI>
<LI>Additional paragraph formatting using an extended
version of the PARAFORMAT structure (PARAFORMAT2) that
supports:&nbsp; Vertical spacing before and after a
paragraph; and single, 1 1/2, double, and user-defined line
spacing within a paragraph. </LI>
<LI>Presumably, bug fixes.&nbsp; I have no examples, but
one can always hope. </LI>
</UL>
<P>Disclaimer:&nbsp; The above list is based primarily on
  the online documentation available at Microsoft's developer
  site (MSDN).&nbsp; I have tested only some of this
  functionality.&nbsp; Before getting all excited over some
  feature that you absolutely must have but dread to code up
  yourself, visit
  <A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/developer/"
	TARGET="_top">MSDN</A> and make sure that the above is
  correct.&nbsp; On the other hand, some functionality seems
  to be supported that the documentation is incorrect, both
  on MSDN and in the header files.&nbsp; As an example, the
  dotted underline style is supported in my Win98 version of
  Rich Edit 2.0 despite all statements to the contrary.&nbsp;
  The bottom line is:&nbsp; If you need the functionality and
  it is mentioned anywhere, try it -- but do not count on it
  until you have confirmed that it works. 
</P> 
<H4>Rich Edit 2.0 Availability Information</H4>
<P>Rich Edit 1.0 is implemented in riched32.dll.&nbsp; The
  newer version is implemented in riched20.dll.&nbsp; To see
  if you already have version 2.0, search your drive for
  riched20.dll. 
</P> 
<P>Unfortunately for those who do not already have it, I
  have been unable to determine where it comes from.&nbsp; I
  did find the following unhelpful comment on the Microsoft
  Developer site (MSDN): 
</P> <BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1">&quot;Windows 95: Windows
95 ships only RICHED32.DLL.&nbsp; However, RICHED20.DLL is
compatible with Windows 95 and may be present if an
application that uses rich edit 2.0 has been installed on
the system.&quot;</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>My best guess is that it comes with Internet Explorer
  4.0.&nbsp; My second guess is that it comes with the Common
  Controls 4.0 update (40comupd.exe) which is available free
  from Microsoft's site.&nbsp; If you have a better guess or,
  better yet, have solved the mystery, please, please let me
  know. 
</P> 
<H4>Updated Rich Edit 2.0 Availability Information&nbsp;</H4>
<P>Kenneth R. de Camargo, Jr., reports definite origins on
  a &quot;clean machine&quot; of either Office 97 or the
  Win95 service pack. 
</P> 
<P>Gerard Patel reports that he &quot;can confirm that you
  can get the thing [riched20.dll] for free by downloading
  the 4 mb Word Viewer 97.&nbsp; A little overkill
  maybe&lt;g&gt;.&quot; 
</P> 
<P>I believe that it is included in Windows98. 
</P> 
<H4>Sample Code Availability</H4>
<P>Both BCB 1.0 &amp; 3.0 use Rich Edit 1.0.&nbsp; An
  example of adapting the VCL TRichEdit class to use the Rich
  Edit 2.0 control is available in the Code Samples section
  of this site.&nbsp; Among other things, the sample
  demonstrates how to: 
</P> <UL>
<LI> Implement multi-level undo/redo. </LI>
<LI> Simplify forward and reverse searches. </LI>
<LI> Identify RTF and binary files. </LI>
<LI> Track the current insert/overstrike state. </LI>
<LI> Recognize and execute URL links. </LI>
<LI> Implement new text formatting (character background
color, superscript, subscript, link, dotted underline,
etc.). </LI>
<LI> Allow setting of a single character-formatting
attribute, e.g., bold, without resetting other formatting
attributes. </LI>
