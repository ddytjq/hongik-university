Riverside stand, however in the 01/02 season the have been moved to the upper tier (seating) and lower tier (terrace) section of the
Stevenage Road stand. 
</P><P>For a club with such a generous benefactor the ground is
surprising old and lacking in facilities, however plans to expand the
stadium have met mixed reactions from local residents, but have finally been given the go ahead
to build a new stadium (Fulham will be
relocated to QPR's Loftus Road stadium for a season. 
</P><P>Unlike the old Riverside Stand, The Stevenage Road Stand has a roof and 
the atmosphere is still good but a row of support pillars ensure
obscured views for most seated fans (and often some standing).
</P><P>Unlike the Putney Terrace the loo's are made of breezeblocks and not just portaloos, but there are still far too few. The is also a food kiosk,
with huge queues, but the food quality was OK.
</P><P>All the stands allow smoking with the exception of the Stevenage
Rd end which being one of the oldest in the country is constructed partly of
wood. No Bookmakers was found inside the ground, but there is one near
to the ground.
</P><P>Visiting fans are normally permitted to bring drums, flags and banners
into the ground.
