               Secondary metabolism:    A metabolic process that produces a metabolite, which peaks only after the main growth
                phase of the cell is completed.<p>
               Sequence: The succession of one thing or event after another, as of genes along a strand of DNA or
                geological events in time.<p>
               Soil matrix:   An assemblage of mineral particles of various sizes, shapes, and chemical characteristics,
                together with organic materials, in various stages of decomposition and living soil
                populations.<p>
               Spatial heterogeneity:   A condition or state that varies with position in space.<p>
               Sporulation:   The formation of spores. Division into many small spores.<p>
               Stochastic:    Involving a random variable. Involving chance or probability.<p>
               Subsurface:    The geologic zone below the surface of the earth. Rock and soil materials lying near, but
                not exposed at, the Earth's surface.<p>
               Surfactant:    A natural or synthetic chemical that promotes the wetting, solubilization, and
                emulsification of various types of organic chemicals.<p>
               Synchrotron:   An apparatus for imparting very high speeds to charged particles by means of a high-frequency electric field and a low-frequency magnetic field.<p>
               Taxonomy: Study of the classification of organisms according to standard rules. Most modern
                taxonomies are phylogenetic (or natural); they attempt to group organisms according to
                evolutionary descent.<p>
               Temporal heterogeneity:  A condition or state that changes in time.<p>
               Thermodynamics:     A branch of physics that deals with the mechanical actions or relationships of heat.<p>
               Transduction:  The transfer of genetic determinants from one microorganism to another or from one
                strain of microorganisms to another by a viral agent.<p>
               Transformation:     In microbiology, genetic transfer wherein DNA from a donor cell enters a recipient cell
                and is incorporated into the recipient DNA by genetic recombination.<p>
               Transposon:    A segment of DNA with a repeat of an insertion sequence element at each end and which
                can migrate from one plasmid to another within the same bacterium, to a bacterial
                chromosome, or to a bacteriophage.<p>
