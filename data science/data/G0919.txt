<ul>
<li> <b> 04/01:</b> The Prime Contractor for the design, manufacture and test
of both Planck and Herschel has been selected and work has started. Following
the approval of ESA's Industrial Policy Committee, and the subsequent 
successful negotiations, the contract between ESA and Alcatel Space (Cannes,
France) has been finalised. The Phase B study has already begun, 
in advance of its initially scheduled start date of 01/06/2001. 
<li> <b> 1/9/00:</b> The European Space Agency released today an Invitation
to Tender to European industry to present proposals for the design, manufacture
and launch of the FIRST and Planck satellites. The proposals are expected to
be presented on 1/12/00, and work will begin in mid-2001. The launch of FIRST
and Planck is planned for the first quarter of 2007.
<li> <b> 23/5/00:</b> In view of the upcoming release of an Invitation to
Tender to industry for the procurement of the Planck (and FIRST) spacecrafts,
a detailed review of the Planck (and FIRST) payload was conducted
by ESA's Director of Science Prof. R.M.B. Bonnet. The review ended succesfully, 
declaring the payloads ready for the release of the ITT, which is now planned
to occur on 1/9/00.
<li> <b> 12/99:</b> The "Payload Architect Study" was completed in December of
1999, and provides a very detailed design of the Planck payload module. In
the last phase of the study a 
<a href="http://astro.estec.esa.nl/Planck/pictures/prephaseb/architect/mock-up/Planck6.gif">
full-scale mock-up of Planck</a> was built and
used to validate the proposed integration procedure for the payload module.
<li> <b> 11-12/5/99:</b> At the Ministerial Council held in Brussels on 
11/12 May 1999, a Level of Resources (LoR) was approved for the Scientific 
Programme covering the period 1999-2002. Although the LoR according to the 
convention should cover a period of 5 years, exceptionally a period of 4 years 
has been agreed since no agreement could be reached at this stage for a 5 
year period. The ministers have decided to agree a new LoR at the latest in 
December 2001. The LoR was approved on the understanding that the <b>'position 
of MARS EXPRESS and FIRST/PLANCK in the programme is preserved'.</b></li>
<li> <b> 17/02/99:</b> ESA's Science Programme Committee formally
approved the selection of the FIRST and Planck scientific payload, as
proposed by the scientific community last year. Although some of the
delegations' votes were "ad referendum", no significant problems in
funding the instruments are expected. The Planck payload consists of
two instruments: the Low Frequency Instrument, proposed by a consortium
of institutes led by Dr N. Mandolesi of CNR-ITESRE (Bologna); and the
High Frequency Instrument, proposed by a consortium of institutes led
by Dr J.L. Puget of IAS (Orsay).</li>
<li> <b> 12/01/99:</b> An industrial activity to define the Planck payload
system was kicked off today at Estec by the FIRST/Planck Project Team.
The Planck Payload Architect study will be conducted by Alcatel (Cannes)
and will last approximately one year. </li>
<li> <b> 13/10/98:</b> Several proposals have been received from industry
in response to the Invitation to Tender to carry out a technical study
of the Planck payload (the so-called "Planck Architect"). The proposals
are being evaluated and it is hoped to kick off this activity before
the end of November. This study will last about one year, and will
provide the inputs required for the issue of the ITT to industry for
the development of the mission (phases B/C/D). </li>
<li> <b> 28/5/98:</b> The SPC discussed the implementation scenario for
FIRST and Planck, and has decided to adopt the "Carrier" as the preferred
scenario (in this solution FIRST and Planck are launched together but
separate shortly after launch and proceed to different orbits). The SPC
additionally set a target cost for FIRST and Planck (corresponding to
that of one Cornerstone mission minus 10%), and a target launch year
(2007). </li>
<li> <b> 28/5/98:</b> The SPC endorsed the recommendations of the Planck
Scientific Evaluation Committee and in so doing (pre-)selected the two
Consortia which will provide the instruments for Planck. The Consortium
providing the Low-Frequency Instrument will be led by N. Mandolesi of 
CNR- Bologna, and the High-Frequency Instrument will be provided by a
Consortium led by J.L. Puget of IAs - Orsay. </li>
<li> <b> 17/2/98:</b> As expected, only two proposals have been received for
Planck instruments. A Consortium led by J.L. Puget of the Institut d'Astrophysique
Spatiale in Orsay (France) is proposing for the High Frequency Instrument, and
a Consortium led by N. Mandolesi of the Istituto TeSRE - CNR in Bologna (Italy)
is proposing for the Low Frequency Instrument. The evaluation process for
the proposals is now officially underway ! </li>
<li> <b> 16/2/98: </b> The technical part of the system definitions studies
for FIRST/Planck have now been completed with the final presentation of the
results at Estec on February 13. Both industries involved (Matra Marconi
Space - Toulouse, and Aerospatiale - Cannes) have concluded that both the
merger concept and the stand-alone Planck concept are technically feasible.
The costing part of the study will now begin, with results due in late March
or early April. </li>
<li> <b> 21/11/97:</b> At its last meeting on 17-18 November, ESA's Science
Programme Committee strongly endorsed the baseline scenario of Horizons 2000 presented by
the Executive. Regarding FIRST and Planck, the baseline scenario now
assumes a launch date in mid-2006. However, for purposes of the AO, the
launch date is still considered to be end of 2005.</li>
<li> <b> 3/10/97:</b> The Announcement of Opportunity for Planck and FIRST instruments has
been released on October 3.
AO documents are available for 
<a href="http://www.estec.esa.nl/spdwww/first/html/aodocs.html">
electronic download. </a> Note: the deadline for submission of questions
for clarification has been moved to November 10. </li>
<li> <b> 6/6/97: </b> A number of similarities between the PLANCK (M3) mission and the
<a HREF="http://astro.estec.esa.nl/SA-general/Projects/First/first.html">
FIRST </a> (CS4) mission have prompted ESA to study the possibility of 
combinining the two projects. Some information on this study is available
