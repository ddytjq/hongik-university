    1999:</STRONG> At any given spot along its path, the Aug. 11,
    1999, total eclipse offered up to 2-1/2 spectacular minutes of
    total lunar coverage of the sun. But for two NASA researchers,
    the show's not over. They're just getting started probing a 50-year-old
    mystery.</P>

    <P>Before the eclipse, Dr. David Noever and Ron Koczor of NASA's
    Marshall Space Flight Center decided to check some hard-to-believe
    measurements reported 50 years ago by Nobel laureate Maurice
    Allais.</P>

    <P>In 1954, Maurice Allais reported that a Foucault pendulum
    exhibited peculiar movements at the time of a solar eclipse.
    If true, his finding raises new questions about the nature of
    such phenomena.</P>

    <P>The inventor of the gyroscope, Jean Bernard Leon Foucault,
    demonstrated during the 1851 World's Fair that a pendulum could
    track the rotation of the Earth. Remarkably, little more than
    two long-term scientific records for Foucault pendulums have
    been published. Both experiments were conducted by eventual Nobel
    Prize winners: Heike Kamerlingh-Onnes, who won the 1913 Nobel
    prize in Physics for his investigations on the properties of
    matter at low temperatures (which led to the production of liquid
    helium), and Allais, who won the 1988 Nobel prize in Economics
    for his contributions to the theory of markets and efficient
    use of resources.</TD>

    marathon experiment in 1954, Allais released a Foucault pendulum
    every 14 minutes - for 30 days and nights - without missing a
    data point. He recorded the direction of precession (in degrees)
    at his Paris laboratory. This energetic show of human endurance
    happened to overlap with the 1954 solar eclipse. It also covered
    slightly more than one orbit of the Earth by the Moon. During
    the eclipse, the pendulum took an unexpected turn, changing its
    angle of rotation by 13.5 degrees.<BR>
<BR>
    <B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Left</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1"
     FACE="Arial">: Prof. Maurice Allais.</FONT></P>

    <P>Both before and after the eclipse, the pendulum experienced
    normal rotation, the Foucault effect, of 0.19 degrees/minute.
    This 13.5-degree excursion in the angular plane persisted throughout
    the length of the eclipse, a total of 2.5 hours of observations
    from eclipse start on Earth's west limb to end on the east limb.
    In 1954, it was 2 hours, 34 minutes. In 1959, it was 2 hours
    14 minutes. Both were partial eclipses at the local point of
    observations. The total observation time was continuous for 30
    days; it just happened to coincide with the 2.5 hours of the
    eclipse. He was not looking for any effect here. Allais got similar
    results when he later repeated the experiment during a solar
    eclipse in 1959.</P>

    <P>For the eclipse of 1999, NASA/Marshall joined several teams
    of scientists investigating the effect.</P>

    <P>&quot;The initial interpretation of the record points to three
    possibilities,&quot; says Noever of NASA/Marshall, &quot;A systematic
    error, a local effect, or the unexplored. To eliminate the first
    two possibilities, we and several other observers will use different
    kinds of measuring instruments in a distributed global network
    of observing stations.&quot;</TD>

    </TABLE>Data collection began on August 11. The times of the
    solar eclipse were 3-9 a.m. in North America, and 9 a.m.-3 p.m.
    in Europe and Middle Asia. These times can be adjusted for exact
    locations, for instance, in Boulder, Colorado, a data set for
    recording would be about 2:30 a.m., continuing until 8:30 a.m.
    That would cover the approach of the shadow, the actual eclipse,
    and the retreat of the shadow.</P>

    <P>Data are being proof-checked on all the major local and global
    variables: atmospheric pressure, magnetic and gravity fields,
    seismic and thermal effects. One goal of this wide network of
    investigators and their diverse instruments was to compare and
    contrast the Aug. 11 events with the results of several earlier
    eclipses, from 1954 to 1995. This distributed network included
    records using six major instrument types: barometers, magnetometers,
    seismographs, and gravity meters, along with large video files
    tracking both stationary and rotating (Foucault) pendulums around
    the world.</TD>

    <P>Two effects of an eclipse that don't require any complex instruments
    to register are its optical shadow and the cooler temperatures
    that lag by about half an hour the eclipse maximum (called second
    contact). Very small pressure waves due to this cool air can
    even be measured by some microbarometers (0.002% atmospheric
    pressure change). Often giving an eerie quiet, this 2-5 degrees
    cooler air can give rise to sporadic wind speed changes that
    usually decrease locally.</P>

    1988 Nobel autobiographical lecture: &quot;During the total eclipses
    of the sun on June 30, 1954, and October 22, 1959, quite analogous
    deviations of the plane of oscillation of the paraconical pendulum
    were observed...&quot; Allais' observations from 1954 and confirmed
    in 1959 registered as over 12.5 times the background noise described
    by the motion of a Foucault pendulum.</FONT></P>

    <P>But during the eclipse one set of Marshall experiments tracked
    changes that required highly sensitive instruments. For example,
    to scout out any possible effects of an eclipse, even the most
    ordinary of pendulums (if properly constructed and controlled)
    can measure small variations as low as 3 millionths of background
    levels for some interesting eclipse-related variables.</P>

    <P>On Aug. 11, the major site in the path of totality was Austrian,
    at the Kremsm&uuml;nster Observatory. As an historic scientific
    site, Kremsm&uuml;nster is a short distance from Linz, Austria,
    where the pioneering astronomer and celestial calendar maker,
    Johannes Kepler, worked at various times with Tycho Brahe. Today,
    the observatory displays the sextant used by Kepler from the
    1590s. This site maintains meteorological records since 1763.</TD>

    <P>Perhaps the most revealing instances, other than the nearly
    2-1/2 hours of observations centered on the partial eclipses,
    would be the four significant contacts in any eclipse: first
    (point of initial optical alignment), second (totality), third
    (point of initial optical departure), and fourth (end). Freeze
    frames of the pendulums on these instances are the first steps
    to understanding the data. All these times and locations are
    synchronized and compared. Each video when digitized is nearly
    half a terabyte (trillion) of data unless compressed. In additional
    to control data before and after the eclipse, a number of sites
    have provided comparison inputs from their archives during normal
    operation and during lunar opposition 2 weeks after the eclipse.</P>

    <P>A general scientific proof-test is to find out if, for any
    variables, did an eclipse signal exceed the background noise
    levels during normal operation by a factor of 3 or more. The
    second question to answer is whether there is a match to any
    significant timing for a related eclipse event. The third question
    to ask is whether competing artifacts, such as pressure changes
    or seismic effects, come into play for those times.</P>

    <P>Finally when these local questions are answered, a global
    solution is needed. How many of the readings synchronize with
    each other, both positive and negative?</P>

    studies in gravity, geophysics, history and economics. Rocket
    pioneer, Wernher von Braun, NASA/Marshall's first director, first
    became interested in Allais' experiments in 1958, when early
    investigations began to look at predicting satellite trajectories
    in orbital mechanics.</P>

    <P>With current Marshall video records in digital form and some
    powerful graphical and tracking routines in software, the task
    is still very challenging if results could be just spread out
    flat on a table in raw form.</P>

    <P>Allais' work shares some features with the latest explanations
    offered to explain the anomalies in the <A HREF="http://www.newswise.com/articles/1998/9/ODDMOVE.LAL.html">Pioneer
    spacecraft</A> - now more than 6 billion miles from the Sun.
    As a low-friction projectile subject to inertia and gravity as
    it moves through space, a pendulum is sometimes compared in its
    motion to an artificial satellite - and thus a unique laboratory
    probe of the properties of space itself.</P>

    <P>As the Paris daily,<EM> Le Figaro, </EM>continued: &quot;Why
    is NASA interested? <A HREF="http://www.newswise.com/articles/1998/9/ODDMOVE.LAL.html">Scientists
    have detected </A>an incomprehensible acceleration of three probes
    leaving the solar system, Pioneer 10 (1972), Pioneer 11 (1973)
    and Ulysses (1989). In the files of the agency, the father of
    American rocketry, the German Wernher von Braun, had supported
    Maurice Allais in 1958.&quot;</P>

    <P>In the most recent September 19 correspondence from Professor
    Allais, he indicated: &quot;In these types of experiments one
    needs to proceed slowly. On the whole, the repetition of these
    experiments offers NASA an exceptional interest.&quot;</TD>
