Nachazel Cup returned to its Keweenaw Peninsularoots this weekend as the local Breakers Guts Frisbee Team defeated lastyear's champs, the Fugitives from Chicago and Marquette, two out of threein the finals.  It was the 40th Annual International Frisbee Tournament.<P>The IFT features Guts Frisbee, with two teams facing off at fourteen metersand throwing the orange Professional model Frisbee as fast as possible ateach other.<P>The Breakers team (Ron Blau, Ron Arvo, Rick LaRue, Scott Stewart, and GregHoule) advanced through the winners' bracket Sunday after finishing 5-2 ina round-robin point-for-a-catch format Saturday.  The Fugitives (Dave Brown,Roger Hill, Lige Johnson, and Scott Brooks) advanced through the loser'sbracket, defeating the Euphoria (John Begoske, Gary Ciaglaski, Scott Smith,and John (Hall of Fame) Hodges team in the semi-final.<P>The weather was warm and sunny on Saturday, with a steady breeze.  Theattendance was excellent for the induction ceremonies for Hodges, BobHansen, Joe Youngman, and the Valasquez twins into the Frisbee Hall ofFame.  It rained just as play was ending for the 8-team field.<P>Sunday it cooled off considerably and the wind picked up.  The single-game,double-elimination, 6-team bracketed format featured the oldno-point-for-a-catch rule.<P>The Breakers won the first game of the finals, then lost the second undersunny skies and a temperature finally hitting into the 60s.  They trailedin the final game 16-17, got the switch to gain the wind advantage, andwent on to win 21-18 when Roger Hill threw short to end the tournament.<P>Both teams caught quite a few in the finals, and Rick LaRue came up withtwo big grabs at the very end.<P>Overall, it was great tourney accented by old friends playing Frisbee'sgreat old sport-Guts.<P></B><A HREF="index.html">Guts Home Page</A></BODY></HTML>
