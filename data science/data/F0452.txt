    show the shell's context menu for directories and files</strong><br>
    <br>
    After sending EnumDeskVB out last summer and receiving an overwhelming amount of response
    from it, the one question which was asked most frequently was &quot;How do I call
    DoTheMenuThing in my app?&quot;, inquiring about displaying the shell's context menu for
    files and folders. Well it's finally here, a demo showing the simplest and bare minimum
    required to do just that (well, with a few cute tricks too...). But still, it's a fair bit
    of work...<br>
    <br>
    In order the display the context menu for any object in the namespace, two essential
    things are needed: a reference to the specified object's parent IShellFolder interface;
    and the object's pidl (pointer to an item ID list), relative to the parent IShellFolder.
    Once obtained, a reference to the parent folder's IContextMenu interface must also be
    obtained, initialized with the proper data, and finally TrackPopupMenu is called to
    display the context menu. Easier said than done. Bit the demo does do a pretty good job of
    explaining everything, hopefully making it all as clear as possible. If you spend enough
    time with it, you should have a pretty good grasp on what pidls are all about too...<br>
    <br>
    03/17/99 update (v1.30)<br>
    - Added IContextMenu2 support, allowing the &quot;Send To&quot; and &quot;Open With&quot;
    submenus to be filled with their respective items.<br>
    - Added subclassing module to catch ownerdraw menu messages for above.<br>
    - Now inserts the focused FileListBox file as the first element of the array of relative
    pidls passed to ShowShellContextMenu. This allows the context menu to contain the commands
    for this file when multiple files are selected.<br>
    - Both listboxes now refresh after each context menu command is carried out.<br>
    <br>
    10/02/98 update (v1.20)<br>
    - Corrected FileListBox selection bug, again.<br>
    - Shows how insert and execute a user-defined menu command in the context menu<br>
    - Did a little more documenting...</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">08/24/98 update
