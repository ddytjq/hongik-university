One of us took it and put it into a well.	Nothing happened.  Later I went back to the bomb and put it in this position (vertical). We	began talking about taking the bomb to play with and then I just put it somewhere and it exploded. The boy near me died and I was thrown a metre in the air. The boy who died was 14 - he had his head cut off.  I was near him and another boy tried to help me.&quot;</i>

	<p>We may have secured a ban on anti-personnel landmines but sadly there is a similar, and just as deadly, threat from cluster bombs.  Unlike landmines, cluster bombs are not designed to be long lasting or victim activated but their failure to explode on impact results in a legacy of civilian casualties long after the war is over.

	<p><b>What Are Cluster Bombs?</b>
	<br>For the last 50 years, cluster bombs have become entrenched in military strategy.  They consist of an outer dispenser containing hundreds of submunitions or 'bomblets' - explosive projectiles which, on release, separate and spread to achieve optimum ground coverage.  In military terms, the aim is to attack armour and cause immediate casualties with each cluster bomb designed to explode close to, or above, a target area.

	<p>But it's the number of unexploded bomblets that's our major concern. Official military figures on failure rates range from 5% to as much as 20%*.  For example, in Kosovo in 1999 NATO used three types of cluster bomb, including 521 British-made RBL755 bombs, each containing 147 bomblets.  Assuming a failure rate of just 5% this would result in approximately 3,900 unexploded bomblets!**  

	<p>Spread 3,900 bomblets across acres of agricultural and grazing land, effectively hiding them from view - deep in soft earth and heavy undergrowth - and you get some idea of the scale of the unseen threat they can pose to farmers and their families, who risk death or severe hardship by attempting to go about their daily lives. In South East Asia, over 30 years since the end of the Vietnam War, some people are still living in fear and economic hardship, unable to farm the land they need to feed themselves and their families.
  	<p><b>Facts on Cluster Bombs***
	<ul>
	<li>By the 1970s all major international powers had introduced cluster bombs into their armouries
	<li>Latest figures put the failure rate of cluster bombs in Kosovo at around 11-12%
	<li>Up to June 2000, after the bombing of Kosovo, 94 people had been killed and more than 400 injured by landmines and unexploded munitions
	<li>At least 40% of Kosovo's post-conflict casualties can be attributed to cluster bombs
	<li>CBU87 cluster bombs, like those used in Kosovo, contain 202 bomblets</b>.
