<B>Title:</B> CETA PREDICTS 10% INCREASE IN HOUSEHOLD INSURANCE PREMIUMS  FOLLOWING RECENT FLOODS </a> |   <B>Release Date:</B> 26/02/2002<hr color="#505050" align="left"><br>Home owners are likely to face higher household insurance premiums as a result of the recent wide spreading flooding, CETA, the UK’s largest general insurance network has predicted this week, following discussions with leading insurance companies.   While householders whose homes have been affected by the latest out break of flooding may eventually find that their houses will become uninsurable.<br>
<br>
‘Flooding is becoming an annual event’ commented David Quick, CETA’s Managing Director ‘The insurers are going to have recoup the money they will pay out in claims and we expect buildings and contents insurance premiums to rise by around 10% over the next 12 months’.<br>
<br>
‘Policy holders who have made flood claims will see bigger premium increases and will also have to accept higher excesses possibly as much as £8,500 for properties deemed to be most at risk of being flooded again’.<br>
<br>
Unlike the rest of Europe, in Britain, flood protection is currently built into all building and contents policies.  However, if the major insurers get their way this situation will not continue.<br>
<br>
Insurers have promised to continue to provide cover in high flood risk areas until the end of 2002.  However, the ABI does not insist that its members have to provide cover for properties that have been repeatedly flooded, for homeowners whose cover was previously provided by another insurer or for new properties located in vulnerable areas. <br>
<br>
The solution to the problem is better flood defences but the Government has already admitted that it will take at least 10 years for these to be put in place to protect high risk areas.  While nobody is quite sure what will happen after 2002, the likelihood is that some properties will become uninsurable and therefore impossible to sell.<br>
<br>
The problems caused by this year’s floods once again demonstrate the need for householders to have adequate cover – building and contents - in place.   However, research indicates that around 40% of householders do not have any contents cover at all and those that do seriously under value their possessions.  Once a property has been affected by flooding it will be too late to get the cover they need.<br>
<br>
CETA recommends that for the majority of homeowners who can still get cover, intermediaries should shop around.   Mortgage brokers should be aware that insurers are increasingly providing quotes based upon full postcodes ratings.  This allows insurers to be highly selective about the properties they will and will not cover.  As a result properties on the same street may be charged different premiums depending upon the perceived risk of flooding.  However, the perceived risk varies from company to company and this provides an excellent opportunity for intermediaries to obtain competitive quotations for their clients.<br>
