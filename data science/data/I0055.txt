		  Diary</B><BR>by Ben King</FONT></P></CENTER> 
	 <P><B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1" COLOR="#000099">Ben King is an England
		supporter that was fortunate enough to secure World Cup 2002 tickets for all of
		England's games. Below are his reports first-hand from Japan.</FONT></B></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1"><U>21st June 2002: England 1 Brazil
		2</U></FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">England supporters, now panda-eyed and
		weary of the relentless travelling, have been in Japan for three weeks now. On
		the eve of the Brazil match, the talk is no longer of just football but of
		things we miss from home. Top of the list is a decent curry, a cup of tea which
		doesn`t taste of air-freshener and somebody that actually understands a word we
		are saying!</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">The influx of big money men coming over
		for the big money game is apparent. The price of a 300USD ticket rises to
		900USD on the black market. Many other English who were unprepared or unwilling
		for such prices watch the game in expensive Roppongi bars. A long and fruitless
		journey for such an anticlimatic match.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">The venue for the match was Shizouka or to
		be more precise - a stadium built in the middle of a forest in some
		inaccessible part of southern Japan in the rough vacinity of Shizouka. The
		journey from Tokyo to the ground was a staggering 4 hours each way. Although
		the matchday organisation and policing has been excellent, you have to question
		the location of some of Japan`s World Cup venues. </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">The mixing of the fans before the game was
		minimal compared to previous rounds. The aloof Brazilians, all of which were
		ex-pats living in Japan, have perhaps missed out on the festival spirit amongst
		other nations by not travelling around with them. One insulting banner waved in
		David Beckhams face as he applauded the fans after the match, only confirmed
		their ungracious manner. </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">So after an indifferent display against a
		very skillful side and `that` freak goal, we`re on our way home. The lasting
		memories I`ll take with me are of the overwhelming friendliness of the Japanese
		and of the hundreds of people I`ve met during the World Cup. </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">Thankyou Japan.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1"><U>15th June 2002: England 3 Denmark
		0</U></FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">Accommodation in the Northern city of
		Niigata was booked out well in advance of England`s second round match, forcing
		many English to either take the train back to Tokyo or stay out partying all
		night in the Samurai Club. You can probably guess what most of us chose to
		do!</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">Never has England been afforded the luxury
		of a 3-0 half-time lead in such an important game. The fans were relaxed and
		celebrated the last 30 minutes by conga-ing down the aisles to the tune of
		'Lets go oriental'.<BR>It was one of those golden moments that are rare for
		die-hard football fans, the game being a mere side show to the raucous
		singing.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">The next day in Tokyo, heavy-headed
		England supporters were ringing up airlines, families and bosses in an attempt
		to stay in Japan at all costs. The word on everyones lips is Brazil. The
		quarter-final match in Shizuoka has the makings of a classic, where anything
		can happen...</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1"><U>12th June 2002: Nigeria 0 England
		0</U></FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">Travelling south from Sapporo, I stop
		briefly in Hakodate and watch the Japan-Russia match with a fanatical group of
		Japanese youths. Their excitement after the victory is almost unrestrained,
		breaking with the stereotype of their closeted culture. The celebrations and
		drink flows long into the night as it would after an important England victory
		in any town from Carlisle to Chelmsford. The host nations victory has
		heightened interest in the World Cup and by the time I arrive in Tokyo, the
		cherub faced image of Inamoto hangs in every subway station along side the
		usual ones of Beckham and Zidane. </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">The day after, I arrive in Kyoto, the base
		chosen by many England fans for the nearby match in Osaka. The remnants of a
		tropical storm hangs over the area and it's been raining the entire day. By the
		morning of the match the skies have cleared and the weather is hot and
		oppressively humid. As a result, the game is played at low tempo and England do
		the bare minimum to progress from "The group of Death".<BR>The Osaka stadium
		was the least impressive on England's agenda. The all purpose ground, ringed
		with a running track, offers poor views from much of the shallow angled
		seating. This said, it's still a thousand times better than the old Wembley
		stadium. The mood of the England fans is understandably muted, but to their
		credit a loyal band of Nigerians bounce and sing throughout the entire 90
		minutes in the face of an almost completely red and white stadium. </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">Now that the group stage is over many of
		our 12,000 or so fans will be leaving Japan and making their way home (along
		with the Argies). So as the England bandwagon moves on to the intriguingly
		named 'Giant Swan' in Niigata, we will increasingly rely on the support of the
		Japanese who have been won over by the English party spirit despite the best
		efforts of the press to condemn us before a ball had been kicked.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1"><U>7th June 2002: Argentina 0 England
		1</U></FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">Along with thousands of other England
		fans, I began the long hike North on the super efficient Japan Rail network.
		The Journey up the Pacific coast took in some panaramic mountainous views
		before entering the longest tunnel in the world, connecting the main island of
		Honshu with Hokaido to the North. The train pulled into Sapporo precisely as
		time tabled, some 10 hours after leaving Tokyo station. Sapporo, the Industrial
		hub of Hokaido and largest potential flashpoint for hoolaganism was well
		prepared. Thousands of extra police had been drafted in and temporary
		accomodation was available to house the fans. Again, as in Tokyo, the fears
		were unconfounded and the English mixed comfortably with the local youths and
		Argentinians enjoying the sunshine in Odori Park. </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">On matchday, groups of English fans
		gathered in the brewery to soak up a sample of the local beer and were in the
		same good spirit of the previous day. The Sapporons seemed to be warming to us
		and as the fans began to sing, I witnessed the improbable sight of an elderly
		Japanese Lady enjoying having her photo taken with a bunch of tattooed Millwall
		fans. </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">Nearing kick-off outside the ground, the
		English support was more passionate than in Saitama and as David Badiel
		remarked to me on entering the stadium, we were "Up for it" this time.
		</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">The match which followed, a battling win
		by the clearly "up for it" England was followed by celebrations in the park
		where fans adorned the statues with England shirts, much to the delight of the
		Japanese, who crowded around to take photos. There is no doubt that the
		excellent behaviour of the supporters in Sapporo and Saitama has done much to
		lift our poor reputation in Japan an elsewhere. And shift a few England shirts
		in Asia too. </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">Now the competion is in full swing and the
		England juggernaught has began to gain momentum, we move back south, to Osaka,
		to face Nigeria in an afternoon kick-off. Under the intense heat and humidity,
		the match is anything but a foregone conclusion. </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1"><U>2nd June 2002: England 1 Sweden
		1</U></FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">The initial fear about the English fans
		behaviour have been put aside and the Japanese have soon become accostomed to
		seeing colourful groups of supporters in their otherwise homogenious and rather
		grey world. Unlike previous tournaments, the England fans seem to mixing with
		fans of other nations and its not uncommon to even see groups of Argentinians
		having a few beers with the English over an afternoon match. This is probably
		because most Japanese only have a passing interest in the World Cup, instead
		prefering to watch baseball, leaving the foreign football fans to huddle
		together in the handfull of bars that are actually showing a game. </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">I spent the hours leading up to kick-off
		with George, a fireman from Sunderland and a genuine England supporter in every
		sense of the word. He had travelled to Japan without tickets but his boisterous
		personality and likeable persona had ensured he had built up a network of
		potential match ticket sources amongst the England fans. George, along with
		scores of young Japanese with their Beckhams haircuts and fake replica shirts,
		bartered for tickets with the hawkers outside Urawa station. The touts
		themselves are the same ones you would see outside Highbury or Old Trafford on
		a Saturday afternoon and it gave me great pleasure to see their initial asking
		price of 300GBP coming down to the face value of 100GBP minutes before
		kick-off. Lets just hope that some of these parasites that rip off our fans
		can`t afford the plane ticket home at that price. </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">Saitama stadium, capacity 63000, with its
		open bowl shape was impressive but perhaps lacked the atmosphere of a tighter
		ground. Indeed, the reason why the touts prices came down so rapidly became
		apparent with large sections of the South stand remaining empty as the game
		kicked off. </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">During and after the game, both the Tokyo
		Police and the seemingly thousands of stewards employed in Saitama acted in a
		friendly restrained manner, instantly knowing the difference between good
		natured singing and real hoolaganism. A philosophy that some European forces
		have been slow to learn. </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">Korea and Japan 2002 really does have the
		potential to be a the best ever World Cup in terms of organisation and passion.
		But as for England? Well a forgetable 1-1 draw with Sweden has only raised the
		stakes for Friday, Argentina and Sapporo. </FONT></P>
