			The study of nonlinear, interactive systems from which interesting 
			and unpredictable behavior emerges is the hallmark of the research 
			that is pursued at SFI.  This includes examining the dynamics of 
			these 'complex systems' and how the systems, and their related 
			dynamics, evolve.  The work is basic, theoretical science.  
			Companies that join the BusNet are often involved in an applied 
			research area that has its roots in, or can be informed by, the 
			work being performed at SFI.  The Business Network provides a bridge between SFI's basic research and 
			the applied work in which our members are engaged.

			An important criterion for successful membership is INTEREST on the 
			part of the participating member.  At least one individual in each 
			member company is designated as the 'contact' person.  That can be 
			anyone from the CEO on down.  This is the individual to whom BusNet 
			mailings, magazine subscriptions and announcements are sent.  But 
			to be beneficial, the interaction needs to be TWO-WAY.  The contact 
			person, along with other interested individuals from the company, 
			regularly attends the SFI sponsored Business Network meetings 
			(usually two/year.)  Member companies are alloted one tuition-free slot to attend the Santa Fe 
			Institute's Complex Systems Summer School (CSSS)  during the month of June in Santa Fe (February deadline).  Involved companies often send an individual(s) to 
			CSSS.  Occasionally, a researcher from one of our  				member groups will come to the Institute to spend a day here, 
			meeting with SFI researchers who may be interested in the research 
			being done in that organization.  (These visits are coordinated 
			through the office of the Director for Business Relations.)  Many 
			members maintain contact with each other through e-mail and phone 
			conversations, and in some instances, meetings among member 
			companies emerge.

			Primarily,  SFI provides its BusNet members with INFORMATION and 
			ACCESS to its research community.  Although some of the same 
			information is available to non-members, the Institute is very 
			PROACTIVE with its Business Network members.  We send out a monthly 
			update via e-mail to keep members informed of SFI activities, 
			workshops and meetings.  We welcome BusNet members into our 
			workshops, which are otherwise closed to non-invited participants.  
			We mail all Working Papers directly to members.  Twice a year, we 
			organize network-members-only meetings where topics of interest are 
			presented and discussed by SFI researchers, other knowledgeable 
			individuals and member companies. International regional meetings 
			are held to accommodate our European and Asian member companies.  
			We offer recruiting opportunities to our members and encourage 
			members to alert us to research job opportunities at their sites. 
			Daily, the Director for Business Relations is available to respond 
			to questions and requests for help.

			Although the BusNet is an extremely important source of revenue for 
			SFI's core research program, network members provide much more than 
			funding to SFI.  They represent a rich resource of information, 
			expertise and real-world systems to SFI's research community.  As 
			an example, one of our member companies provided a researcher to a 
			SFI software development team on a half-time basis, in order to 
			give that group valuable input when designing a modeling tool for 
			complex adaptive systems.  Other companies have volunteered SFI 
			access to interesting data banks over which models of interactive 
			systems could be structured.  Member companies provide symbiotic 
			research environments that may be available to SFI graduate and 
			post-doctoral researchers for future employment.

			One of SFI's main assets is its environment, which allows 
			researchers to spend focused time with few outside commitments.  
			For this reason, SFI does not send researchers to visit our network 
			members.  From time to time, a member company will offer to bring 
			a scientist to meet with them, but this is done on a consulting fee 
			basis and is between the member company and the individual 
			researcher.  The Director of Business Relations DOES make site 
			visits to member companies, and in this manner is able to introduce 
			larger groups of individuals within a member company to SFI and its 
			interesting work.

			Most of our members indicate that the network has helped them to 
			'think in new ways about familiar topics.'  Some members talk about 
			discovering 'novel spin-offs from complexity research (which are) 
			vital to their organization.'   Others attribute SFI with 'opening 
			up a vast new world - a way of understanding organizations and 
			behavior that we have only begun to explore.'  Benefits are unique 
			for each group, and frequently reflect the level of interaction and 
			interest expressed.  We do not perform regular business consulting.  
			What we DO offer is a rich educational and research environment 
			where traditional disciplinary barriers are removed and new 
			directions for scientific research are created.
