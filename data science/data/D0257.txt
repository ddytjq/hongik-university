        - The market for digital cameras has greatly expanded during the past 
        year and numerous studies indicate that this expansion will continue aggressively 
        at least through 2005 [InfoTrends]. PhotoFairy iTV service allows users 
        an alternative to managing and sharing their photos over the TV instead 
        of solely through the PC with regular Internet users. Users can now share 
        their pictures with non-PC users, such as parents, grandparents, etc.

        that this application does not directly interact with a specific TV channel. 
        However, service providers offer these types of applications to their 
        viewers as part of the basic application suite in order to encourage consumers 
        to purchase a set-top box over a PC for the home. Other examples of passive

        which will in turn likely lead to other revenues in the future. <br>

        Photography is considered to be one of the world's most popular hobbies. 
        Many people are switching from the traditional still cameras to digital 
        cameras, with one of the main reasons being there is no deterioration 
        of a digital image due to aging. <br>
        <br>
        In 2001, 21% of all cameras sold around the world will be low-end digital 
        cameras. By 2006, 63% of all cameras sold worldwide will be digital cameras.

      </ul>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Allow 
        users the ability to hook their digital cameras into their set top box

        2. Allow users to manage their photos by grouping them into albums, similar 
        to a physical photo album. <br>
        3. Enable users to annotate photos with simple text messages. <br>
        4. Allow users to share their photos with friends and family by giving 
        them access to their albums. This is a matter of synchronizing with the 
        server to let users on the user base know that new photos have been added.<br>
        5. Enable service providers a value-added service, which will help them 
        to sell more subscriptions to their iTV service. <br>
        6. Allow advertisers new and more efficient ways of targeting their intended 
        audience. <br>

        Photos</i></b><br>
        <br>
        This function allows hosts to upload their photos directly to the set-top 
        box. For the purposes of this exercise, assume the PC is the set-top box. 
        Therefore this becomes a TV interface exercise, which would include key-nav 
        and TV UI. Developers must leverage the PC's connectivity because it is 
        already possible to connect digital cameras to a PC. <br>
        <br>
        In theory, there is an &quot;Upload Now&quot; button to load the photos 
        onto the set-top box. In reality, instead of loading the photos from a 
        digital camera interface, hosts will have to load photos from a directory.<br>
        <br>
        This could easily be a web application but we are not looking for this. 
        The upload function must be a DeviceTop application, which uses Java. 
        This leaves the opportunity for this application to get embedded in other 
        devices in the future. <br>
        <br>
        <i><b>Organization of Photos</b></i><br>
        <br>
        When users upload pictures to their set-top boxes, they will want to be 
        able to organize them, much like they would a physical photo album. <br>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This function 
        allows all uploaded photos to go into a Master List, which is private 
        to all viewers. There is always an original copy of each photo in this 
        list, unless deleted permanently by the user. The host would link to the 
        photos in the Master List when creating individual albums. All photos 
        will be associated with a numeric value for linking purposes in order 
        to create individual albums. <br>
        <b><br>
        &middot; Ability to create a library of albums </b><br>
        <br>
        This function allows hosts to organize photos into albums. There is only 
        one layer of organization allowed in this system, in order to keep it 
        simple. There is the Master List and then albums - the albums do not have 
        sub-directories. Albums can be private to all, public to all, or private 
        to some people. This is controlled through ACLs, which has the ability 
        to invite users to view individual albums. <br>
        Hosts are able to link to photos from their Master List into more than 
        one album.<br>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>&middot; 
        Write a text message </b><br>
        <br>
        This function allows hosts the option to type a text message with each 
        photo. The host is able to type a default text message on each photo in 
        the Master List. The host is also able to customize their text messages 
        in each album. If there is no customized message in the albums, the default 
        message will appear. <br>

        <br>
        <i><b>Share Photos with Others </b></i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hosts are 
        able to share their photos with friends and family. Hosts will have the 
        ability to notify others that new pictures have been added to albums if 
        they deem them to be shared. As a developer, you might want to set up 
        this function through Access Control Lists. <br>
        <br>
        When the host uploads photos, they are automatically placed in a Master 
        List, which is private to the host. The host then has the ability to organize 
        photos into albums allowing each album to have a viewer list. After their

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>(3) </b>You 
        are a business executive who has just had a baby. You travel a lot with 
        work but don't want to miss a single day of your baby's growth. You and 
        your wife own a digital camera, where you store all of your pictures on 
        your set-top box. You have opted to have a set-top box in the home instead 
        of a PC. While away, your wife takes photos of the baby and uploads them 
        to the TV instead of a PC. At night, while away, you simply click onto 
        iTV mode in the hotel, log onto your account, and access the new daily 
        photos of your new baby. You send text messages back for your wife to 
        read. <br>
