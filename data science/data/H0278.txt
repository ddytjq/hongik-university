After the retina:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Once the ganglion cell axons leave the retina, theytravel through the optic nerve to the <B>optic chiasm</B>, a partialcrossing of the axons.  At the optic chiasm the left and rightvisual worlds are separated.  After the chiasm, the fibers arecalled the optic tract.  The optic tract wraps around the cerebralpeduncles of the midbrain to get to the <B>lateral geniculatenucleus (LGN)</B>.  The LGN is really a part of the thalamus,and remember that nothing gets up to cortex without synapsingin thalamus first (if the cortex is the boss, the thalamus isan excellent secretary).  Almost all of the optic tract axons,therefore, synapse in the LGN.  The remaining few branch off tosynapse in nuclei of the midbrain:  the <B>superior colliculi</B>and the <B>pretectal area</B>.  We will come back to these.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino"  COLOR=#CC00CC>B.  The lateral geniculate nucleus:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >"Geniculate" means knee-shaped, and itis a pretty accurate description of the LGN.  No matter how youslice it, the LGN looks like a striped Andy-Capp-hat.  The stripesare actually layers, and there should be six of them in most partsof the LGN.  Each layer receives inputs from a different eye: 3 layers for the left eye and 3 layers for the right. (Keep inmind, each LGN gets information from 1 hemifield, but 2 eyes.)These layers alternate, so if you were to label the axons from<U>just one </U>eye, you would see alternate stripes labeled,as below.<BR></FONT><P><IMG SRC="cvis1.gif"><BR><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >There is a second aspect of organization in the LGN. The outer 4 layers are composed of small cells, and correspondingly,receive inputs from the small ganglion cells of the retina.  Theselayers are called the <B>parvocellular layers</B>.  The <B>magnocellularlayers</B>, on the other hand, are composed of large cells andreceive their input from large ganglion cells.   We will returnto the reason for this segregation at the end of the section.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino"  COLOR=#CC00CC>C.  On to cortex:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >The neurons in the LGN send their axons directlyto <B>V1 </B>(primary visual cortex, striate cortex, area 17)via the <B>optic radiations</B>.  This highway of visual informationcourses through the white matter of the temporal and parietallobes, and can be very vulnerable to strokes.  Once the axonsreach V1, they terminate primarily in a single sub-layer of cortex. </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >Remember that all cortical areas in the cerebrumare composed of six basic layers, but that each specific areaof cortex may have modifications of layers to best serve its function. It was on the basis of layer appearance and cell types <U>alone</U>that Brodmann first subdivided the cortex into over 50 areas. These areas are known today to correspond to functionally distinctareas - area 17 is primary visual cortex, for example.  As youstruggle to identify layers 1-6 in any piece of cortex, ponderthe fact that this man identified 50 different subtleties of thoselayers.  It's awe inspiring.  </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >The layers of V1 are specialized in one primary way- layer 4 has been expanded into 4 sublayers:  4A, 4B, 4Ca, and4Cb.  Layer 4A is a dark layer, while the deeper 4B is a verypale layer full of myelin.  4B is actually visible without a microscope- it is the <B>line of Gennari</B>, the white stripe that givesV1 its other name, <B>striate cortex</B>.  Layer 4C is importantbecause it receives most of the input from the LGN.  Due to thesespecializations, you too can see a transition between Brodmannareas.  Follow along the 4B stripe, and you will see it suddenlydisappear into a more compact layer 4.  This is the transitionbetween areas V1 and <B>V2</B> (secondary visual cortex, area18).<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="cvis2.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino"  COLOR=#CC00CC>D.  Ocular dominance stripes:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >We have mentioned that the LGN axons enter into layer4C.  However, recall that the LGN is segregated by eye.  Thisseparation is maintained as the axons enter the cortex.  Eachcluster of axons from each LGN layer spreads out in a little columnwithin 4C.</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="cvis3.gif"></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >As the signal is transmitted to upper layers of cortex,the information from the two eyes is mixed and binocular visionis created, but here in 4C the two eyes are still entirely separate. Therefore, if you could label the inputs from a single eye, in4C you would see little pillars of label.  If you were to cuttangentially (parallel to the surface) through layer 4C, you wouldsee that all those pillars line up next to each other and formtiger stripes.  These are the <B>ocular dominance stripes.<BR></B></FONT><CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD WIDTH=257><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino"  COLOR=#CC00CC>E. What exactly IS cytochrome oxidase?</FONT></B><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >Cytochrome oxidase</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" > is a staining technique which preferentially stains metabolically active neurons.  This is a useful tool in looking at ocular dominance columns:  if an eye is surgically closed in an experimental animal, a cytochrome oxidase stain will reveal the LGN axons carrying signals from the remaining, active eye.  This is how one eye can be selectively stained, as in the picture to the right.  However, researchers staining with cytochrome oxidase happened upon another property of V1. In layer 3, certain areas always seemed to stain darkly, regardless of the status of the eyes.  Tangential sections through layer 3 showed a pattern similar to leopard spots.  These areas of stain were named <B>blobs</B>, and the pale areas around them, <B>interblobs</B>.  It has since</FONT></TD><TD WIDTH=257><CENTER><IMG SRC="cvis4.gif"></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2 WIDTH=515><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >been shown that they represent a division of labor within the cortex: specifically, the blobs are more involved in color processing than the interblobs. </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino"  COLOR=#CC00CC>F.  Receptive fields in V1:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >Recall that the receptive fields of both ganglioncells and LGN neurons were center-surround, and that they respondedoptimally to points of light.  Neurons in the cortex, however,respond very poorly to points of light.  The optimal stimulusfor most cortical neurons turns out to be a bar of light, in avery specific orientation.  How did this come about?  One hypothesisis that the key is in how the LGN axons converge on the corticalneurons.<BR></FONT><CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD WIDTH=257><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >Take three LGN neurons responding to adjacent ganglion cells.  Their ON-center receptive fields are represented by this array of donuts.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >Now hook all three of these LGN neurons up to one cortical neuron, and dictate that all 3 must be excited at once to evoke a response in cortex.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >What would be the absolute optimal stimulus to drive the cortical neuron nuts?  Three points of light, right?<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >Three precisely spaced points of light are actually not so likely in nature, but how about a line?</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >Sure enough, a bar of light will turn on this cortical neuron.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >How about a bar oriented 90&#176; to the right?  You can see that this stimulus would be too weak for the cortical neuron.</FONT></TD><TD WIDTH=257><P><IMG SRC="cvis5.gif"></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >The simplest type of receptive field in the cortexfollows this arrangement closely.  An optimal stimulus is a barof light in the center of the receptive field, at some preciseorientation.  Other connections and convergences in other areasof cortex set up more and more complicated receptive fields, untilsingle cells can be responsive only to the shape of a face.  Butreally all of the information for that face entered your retinaas nothing more than...      ...a thousand points of light.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino"  COLOR=#CC00CC>G.  Division of labor in the visualsystem:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >What we see can be divided into several categoriesof vision: color, linear pattern, motion, etc.  The perceptionof these different categories requires a wide variety of equipment,and some of the divisions are made as early as the retina.  Forexample, rods see only black and white, and can function in dimlight, whereas cones can see all colors but require full light. There are at least two types of ganglion cells as well.  Thereare small ganglion cells that dominate in the fovea: they arecolor sensitive and are "fine-grained", meaning theirreceptive fields are small enough that they can pick up a highlevel of detail.  These small cells are called <B>P cells</B>(P for <I>parvo</I>  for small).  The second type of ganglioncells have large dendritic arrays, and receive information froma wide radius of bipolar cells.  They are mostly found in theperipheral retina, are not color-sensitive, and are "coarse-grained"and relatively insensitive to detail.  Their main asset is thatthey are sensitive to motion - you can imagine that due to theirwidth they can track a signal flashing across several bipolarcells.  These are the <B>M cells</B> (M for <I>magno </I>).  <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >These two types of information, motion vs. colorand form, are maintained in separate compartments all the wayup the visual pathway.  They are kept in separate layers in theLGN, enter V1 via separate sublayers (4Ca vs. 4Cb), and afterpassing through V2, go on to separate areas of associative cortex. In the end, the <B>parietal visual cortical areas</B> (such asMT and PP) end up dealing with motion of objects, navigation throughthe world, and spatial reasoning (which is essentially movingthings around in your head).  <B>Temporal visual areas</B> (suchas V4 and IT) are involved with the complex perception of patternsand forms as recognizable objects.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >In summary, when your Aunt Edna goes streaking byyou after unwisely taking a dip in the snake-infested pond outback, your color/form pathway will identify her as Aunt Edna;your motion pathway will tell you which way she went.  Any emotionalresponse you attach to this event will be mediated by the amygdala,incidentally. <BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino"  COLOR=#CC00CC>H.  The pupillary light reflex:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >Way back at the beginning of this section, therewas mention of a few optic tract fibers which bypassed the LGNentirely, traveling instead to the less glamorous but equallyessential midbrain.  One of their targets in the midbrain is the<B>pretectal area</B>, which mediates the <B>pupillary light reflex</B>. This reflex can be demonstrated by shining a light in one eye;if all is working correctly, both pupils will constrict.</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="cvis6.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >Light enters the retina and from there travels directlyto the pretectal area.  After synapsing, the information is sentto the <B>Edinger-Westphal nuclei</B> on <U>both sides</U> ofthe midbrain - this is the crucial step in ensuring that botheyes react to light.  The Edinger-Westphal nuclei, via the <B>IIIrdnerve</B>,  control the pupillary constrictors that narrow thepupils.  Knowledge of all this enables you to test the statusof your patient's visual system by shining a light into each eye.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >For example, if you test each eye, and no matterwhere you shine the light, the left pupil constricts and the rightone remains dilated, what is your conclusion?  There must be aproblem with constriction on the right, such as IIIrd nerve damage.  BUT, what if shining light into the left eye produces bilateralconstriction, and shining light into the right eye produces noconstriction?  Here the problem must be with the right optic nerveitself, or possibly the right pretectal area.  What would happenif you made a cut down the midline of the midbrain, severing rightfrom left?<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=#0000FF FACE="Palatino"><A HREF="http://thalamus.wustl.edu/course">RETURN TO HOME PAGE</A><BR></FONT></B></BODY></HTML>
