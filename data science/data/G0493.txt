<H1>DMR Data Products </H1>

<P>
<HR><I>A <A HREF="dmr_products_table.html">
table that summarizes the DMR data products</A> available as of 10 January
1996 can be viewed on your screen. Postscript and LaTeX
versions of the table are available by ftp in the nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dmr/doc4
directory. Anonymous ftp instructions are given below. <B>All of the data
products, except the Time-Ordered Data, are <A HREF="#ftp">ftp</A> and
<A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dmr">Web</A> accessible. </B></I></P>

<P>The data products are categorized as Project Data Sets (PDS) and Analyzed
Science Data Sets (ASDS). The DMR Project Data Sets are <A HREF="#skymaps_asds">Sky
Maps</A> and <A HREF="#pixperm">Pixelized Differential Data</A> from each
of the six instrument channels, and <A HREF="#tod">Time-Ordered Data</A>.
The <A HREF="#skymaps_asds">Analyzed Science Data Sets</A> are maps of
various Galactic emission components and maps of the cosmic microwave background
anisotropy. Maps equivalent to each of the PDS and ASDS Sky Maps but pixelized
in Galactic instead of ecliptic (the default) coordinates are also provided.
All of the data products except the Time-Ordered Data are in FITS binary
tables. Detailed descriptions of the DMR, the data processing, and the
data products are given in an <A HREF="dmr_exsup.html">Explanatory Supplement</A>.
</P>

<P>Observations from the entire four-year period of DMR operation are covered
by the products released on 10 January 1996. The four-year Sky Maps are
the most sensitive achievable with DMR data and are recommended for new
analyses. However, since numerous publications have been based on the one-
and two-year maps released as intermediate data products, those maps have
been kept on line. </P>

<P>The following DMR Data Products are available on line from the NSSDC's
COBE ftp server:</P>

<P><A NAME="ftp"></A><B>Note that problems occasionally arise when the
files are downloaded over the Web. If you have trouble using a DMR FITS
file, please use ftp to download the file.</B> An ftp session should go
something like this: </P>

</PRE>

<P>In order to reduce the brightness gradient and keep map-making errors
to a minimum, a dipole was subtracted prior to pixelizing the data to generate
the PDS Sky Maps. (This improvement in the data reduction was implemented
after the 1-year maps were produced and released as an &quot;Initial Product&quot;
in 1993; the 1-year maps contain the dipole signature, which is due to
our motion with respect to the cosmic microwave background.) Note that
the dipole parameters, which are given in the FITS headers, are not intended
to be definitive, best-fit values.

<H2><A NAME="skymaps_asds"></A>Sky Maps and Analyzed Science Data Sets
</H2>

<P>There are six sky maps, corresponding to the two independent channels
(designated A and B) and three frequencies (31.5, 53, and 90 GHz) of the
COBE Differential Microwave Radiometers (DMR). The maps are <A HREF="skymap_info.html">
quadrilateralized spherical projections</A> in either ecliptic or Galactic
coordinates. A sparse matrix least squares minimization technique was used
to derive, from highly redundant sky sampling, a differential temperature
for each of 6144 map pixels while simultaneously allowing for instrumental
and systematic effects. The observations were made with a 7 degree beam
and are presented in 2.8 degree pixels. The maps are in FITS files formatted
as described in the <A HREF="dmr_exsup.html"> DMR Explanatory Supplement</A>.
File names indicate the frequency, channel, and world coordinates of the
map (ecliptic by default; Galactic if specified). For example, the 53 GHz,
channel A map in ecliptic coordinates is named dmr_skymap_53ghz_a.fits
and its Galactic coordinate counterpart is named dmr_skymap_galactic_53a.fits.
</P>

<P>Due to the differential nature of the observations, the maps have unconstrained
antenna temperature zero points. While the dipole anisotropy has been removed
to first order (see note above), emission from the Galaxy remains. The
<A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dmr/asds4/"> DMR Analyzed Science
Data Sets </A> include Galactic Emission Maps and Cosmic Emission Maps.
The latter result when the Galactic emission is removed. The modeled Galactic
components are synchrotron emission (dmr_synch.fits), free-free emission
(dmr_free.fits), and thermal dust emission (dmr_dust.fits). Two techniques
were used to produce the Cosmic Emission Maps, a &quot;subtraction technique&quot;
in which the Galactic components are subtracted from the DMR maps (dmr_dsmb.fits),
and a &quot;combination technique&quot; in which a linear combination of
the DMR maps is used to cancel the Galactic emission (dmr_dcmb.fits). Corresponding
to each of these maps is an equivalent map pixelized in Galactic coordinates
(e.g., dmr_dust_galactic.fits). For a more detailed description of the
Analyzed Science Data Sets and the corresponding Galactic Coordinate Data
Sets, see the <A HREF="dmr_exsup.html"> DMR Explanatory Supplement</A>
and references therein. 
<HR></P>

<H2><A NAME="pixperm"></A>Pixelized Differential Data </H2>

<P>The calibrated differential antenna temperature (DT) and the number
of observations are given for each combination of sky positions observed
simultaneously by a DMR horn pair. The data (temperature in &quot;horn
1&quot; minus temperature in &quot;horn 2&quot;) are sorted according to
the COBE sky map pixel number seen by horn 1, and sub-sorted by the horn
2 pixel number. The observations are made with a 7 degree beam and presented
in 2.8 degree pixels. The <A HREF="skymap_info.html"> pixelization scheme</A>
is described in a FITS file called <A HREF="http://nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov/anon_dir/cobe/general_information/skymap_info/dmr_firas_skymap_info.fits">
dmr_firas_skymap_info.fits</A>. </P>

<P>All differential temperatures for a given pixel pair are combined, after
correcting for known systematic errors and subtracting a nominal dipole
to minimize pixel gradient effects, into four moment sums, specifically
the sums of DT, (DT)^2, (DT)^3, and (DT)^4. The Pixelized Differential
Data are presented in FITS files formatted as described in the <A HREF="dmr_exsup.html">
DMR Explanatory Supplement</A>. There are six Pixelized Differential Data
files corresponding to two independent DMR channels at each of three frequencies:
31.5, 53, and 90 GHz. The Pixelized Differential Data Sets describe observations
made during the same four-year period as the Sky Maps (see above). </P>

<P>Both the <A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dmr/pds4/">4-year</A>
and <A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dmr/old2yr/">2-year</A> Pixelized
Differential Data files are online, but be aware that each file is about
40 MB in size. If you would prefer not to download these files over the
Web, they may be ordered either on <A HREF="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cd-rom/web_store.cgi?category=cobe&cart_id=">
CD-ROM</A> or tape through <A HREF="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/about_cruso.html">
the NSSDC's Coordinated Request and User Support Office</A>. 
<HR></P>

<H2><A NAME="tod"></A>Time-Ordered Data </H2>

<P>Time-Ordered Data (TOD) from the DMR covering the period 19 November
1989 to 29 December 1993 (i.e., the entire period during which observations
were made) are available in native format. The contents and format of the
TOD are described in the <A HREF="dmr_exsup.html"> DMR Explanatory Supplement</A>.
The data are in daily files, each 5 MB in size. The TOD (approximately
7.5 GB) may be obtained from the <A HREF="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/">
NSSDC</A> on tape. To request a set of tapes, contact the <A HREF="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/about_cruso.html">
