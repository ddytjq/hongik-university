<hr>
<h1>Previous Updates:</h1>
<p>NASA names the new spacecraft heading to Mars "2001 Mars Odyssey" named after the popular book and movie "2001: A Space Odyssey". Arthur C. Clarke, author of "2001: A Space Odyssey," endorsed the new mission name.

<p>NASA launched Odyssey to Mars on April 7, 2001. The spacecraft will arrive at Mars on Oct. 20, 2001, for insertion into an initial elliptical capture orbit.

<p>The orbiting spacecraft is designed to find out what Mars is
made of, detect water and shallow buried ice and study the
radiation environment.

<p>The orbiter will study the kinds of minerals on the surface
and measure the amount of hydrogen in the shallow subsurfaces of
the planet, which will give scientists clues about the presence
of water, either past or present. It will also provide
information on the structure of the Martian surface and on the
geological processes that may have caused it. Finally, the
orbiter will take all-important measurements of the planet's
radiation environment so potential health risks to future human
explorers can be evaluated. To do this, the spacecraft carries
three science instruments: The Thermal Emission Imaging System
(THEMIS), the Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS), and the Mars
Radiation Environment Experiment (MARIE).

<p>In August, NASA announced plans to launch twin rovers which
will land on Mars in 2003, and later this fall, will announce
details of the multi-year Mars exploration program plan.

<h1>Current Updates:</h1>

<p><br>
<b><u>Sunday, April 8, 2001</u></b>

<p>One day after launch from Cape Canaveral, Fla., the
Mars Odyssey mission continues to go exceedingly well.

<p>Following acquisition of the spacecraft's signal by a
Deep Space Network ground station at Canberra, Australia,
shortly before 9 a.m. Pacific time Saturday, the mission team
has continued to monitor the status of spacecraft subsystems,
all of which are performing normally. Ground controllers
established a two-way communication link between Mars Odyssey
and Earth, enabling the navigation team to start collecting
data to assess the spacecraft's flight path.

<p>Among various housekeeping events Saturday, the team
commanded the spacecraft to transmit to Earth at a high rate
for playback of data recorded during launch. They also
commanded a desaturation of the spacecraft's reaction wheels,
a procedure in which the gyro-like devices are spun down in
order to remove excess momentum. Ground controllers concluded
that an alarm triggered shortly after launch by a temperature
sensor on Odyssey's solar panel is not a concern. Saturday
afternoon they switched to a ground station at Santiago,
Chile, to communicate with the spacecraft. The project is
using Santiago to fill gaps in its Deep Space Network tracking
coverage during early cruise.

<p>This morning the team commanded the spacecraft to
transition out of a "safe mode" it was in during launch to a
normal operating mode. They also turned the spacecraft so that
the medium-gain antenna that Odyssey is transmitting over is
pointed toward Earth. As of late morning, the team was
assessing the state of spacecraft subsystems, and if all is
well a command will be sent this afternoon to make the
transition complete.

<p>Early navigation calculations show that the magnitude
of the first trajectory correction maneuver fine-tuning the
spacecraft's flight path April 16 will be only 6 meters per
second. Because that maneuver will be so small, propellant
will be saved for use during Mars orbit insertion, aerobraking
and the orbital mission.<br>
<br>

<b><u>Thursday, April 12, 2001</u></b>

<p>Due to a favorable launch trajectory on Saturday, flight
controllers for Mars Odyssey have decided that they can
postpone the first maneuver to fine-tune the spacecraft's
flight path. All systems on the spacecraft are in excellent
health.

<p>The first trajectory correction maneuver had been
scheduled for Monday, April 16, but after analyzing the
current spacecraft trajectory, spacecraft engineers have
decided to wait until later in the cruise phase to perform the
first maneuver.  The navigation team is currently evaluating
dates in late May for a potential mid-course correction.

<p>Flight controllers will now concentrate on turning
on and calibrating the science instruments.  On Monday, they
will send commands to Odyssey that tell the spacecraft to
position itself in its cruise attitude and point both the
medium and high gain antennas toward the Earth.  On Tuesday,
they will turn on the thermal infrared imaging system (THEMIS)
and then on Thursday, THEMIS will take both a thermal infrared
and a visible image of the Earth.

<p>Odyssey is currently 1,488,556 kilometers (924,944 miles)
from Earth and traveling at a speed of 3.3 kilometers per
second (7,455 miles per hour) relative to the Earth.<br>
<br>

<b><u>Thursday, April 19, 2001</u></b>

<p>This morning flight controllers turned the Mars Odyssey
spacecraft and pointed the thermal emission imaging system
(THEMIS) instrument at the Earth and Moon to calibrate the
instrument.  All calibration objectives were met.

<p>Engineers are in the process of redesigning the
spacecraft's cruise attitude after they noted temperature
readings that were higher than expected on a high-gain antenna
gimbal earlier this week.  The cruise attitude points the
high-gain antenna toward Earth as the spacecraft travels
toward Mars.

<p>Next week, the team will turn on the Martian radiation
environment experiment (MARIE) and prepare to transition to
the new cruise attitude.

<p>Odyssey is currently 3,491,598 kilometers (2,169,574
miles) from Earth and traveling at a speed of 3.3 kilometers
per second (7,408 miles per hour) relative to Earth.<br>
<br>

<b><u>Friday, April 27, 2001</u></b>

<p>Flight controllers for NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey
spacecraft at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory report that the
spacecraft is doing fine after the reset of one of its on-
board computers Tuesday, possibly caused by a solar flare.

<p>"The spacecraft is in excellent condition and back in its
normal operating mode," said David A. Spencer, Odyssey's
mission manager at JPL. "We are looking into the possibility
that intensified solar activity may have affected data in the
on-board memory."  The affected data in the computer memory is
believed to be the cause of the computer reset that happened
Tuesday morning. Preliminary data analysis indicates that a
reset of the on-board flight computer caused the entry into
"safe mode."  The spacecraft returned to normal operations
Wednesday morning.

<p>Prior to the safing event on Tuesday, the spacecraft
transitioned to its cruise attitude where it points its high-
gain antenna toward the Earth.  On Monday, the team turned on
the Martian radiation environment experiment and Wednesday
they turned on the electronics for the gamma ray spectrometer
instrument.

<p>Today, 20 days after launch, Odyssey is about 5.8 million
kilometers (3.6 million miles) from Earth and traveling at a
speed of about 39 kilometers per second (about 69,300 miles
per hour) relative to the Sun.<br>
<br>

<b><u>Wednesday, May 9, 2001</u></b>

<p>This morning, flight controllers for NASA's 2001 Mars
Odyssey spacecraft at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
successfully tested the ability of the high-gain
communications antenna to send and receive commands.  Since
launch, the spacecraft has been receiving commands over its
low-gain antenna and transmitting signals via its medium-gain
antenna.  Today's test showed the high-gain antenna is working
well, and engineers will begin using that link regularly at
the end of the month.

<p>Last Friday, May 4, engineers conducted a thruster
calibration test designed to measure the small velocity
changes that occur when the spacecraft fires its attitude
control thrusters. Navigators report that the test went
extremely well and that the data are
consistent with performance that was predicted before launch.

<p>Odyssey is currently about 9.5 million kilometers (5.8
million miles) from Earth and traveling at a speed of about 30
kilometers per second (about 67,700 miles per hour) relative
to the Sun.<br>
<br>

<b><u>Wednesday, May 23, 2001</u></b>

<p>NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft performed its first
trajectory correction maneuver this morning as it fired its
thrusters to fine-tune its flight path for arrival at Mars in
October.

<p>Odyssey fired its thrusters for 82 seconds at 10:30 a.m.
Pacific time, which changed the spacecraft's velocity by 3.6
meters per second (8.1 miles per hour).

<p>"The maneuver executed as planned, and we are very
pleased with the spacecraft performance," said David A.
Spencer, mission manager for 2001 Mars Odyssey at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.  "Due to the favorable
launch we received, this maneuver was much smaller than
planned pre-launch.  This will allow us to reach Mars with our
propellant tanks nearly full, and we will make good use of the
extra fuel."

<p>The principal investigator for the high energy
neutron detector instrument reports the detection of gamma ray
bursts, occurring on May 8 and May 17.  Comparing these
measurements with similar measurements from other spacecraft
allows scientists to determine the direction of the burst
sources.  The high energy neutron detector and the companion
neutron spectrometer instrument also detected streams of
particles and radiation from enhanced solar activity on May
20.

<p>Odyssey is currently about 14.3 million kilometers (8.9
million miles) from Earth and traveling at a speed of about 29
kilometers per second (about 65,700 miles per hour) relative
to the Sun.<br>
<br>

<b><u>Monday June 18, 2001</u></b>

<p>NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft is in excellent
health as engineers continue to check out and evaluate the
performance of its systems and science instruments during its
early cruise phase.

<p>Friday morning, June 15, flight controllers successfully
conducted a visible imaging calibration test of the thermal
emission imaging system by pointing the instrument at a star,
Menkent, and taking several pictures.  Those data were
transmitted to Earth during the weekend.  Also last week,
engineers began a process of heating the gamma ray
spectrometer detector in order to erase radiation damage that
has naturally occurred to the detector thus far during cruise.
The detector will then be in an optimal state to collect
science data once the gamma sensor head door is opened later
this month.

<p>Earlier this month, engineers successfully tested the UHF
radio system by sending and receiving data via the 46-meter
UHF antenna at Stanford University in California.  The team is
continuing to review the data from those tests and plans to
conduct additional tests this week.

<p>The Deep Space Network has taken several measurements
using the delta differential one-way range measurement, a
technique that uses two ground stations to determine the
angular position of the spacecraft relative to the known
position of a quasar.  The measurements provide the navigation
team with an additional source of information, adding
confidence to their estimates of the Odyssey flight path.

<p>Currently, Odyssey is 26.6 million kilometers (16.5
million miles) from Earth, traveling at a speed of 27.6
kilometers per second (about 61,900 miles per hour) relative
to the Sun.<br>
<br>

<b><u>Monday July 2, 2001</u></b>

<p>NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft fine-tuned its flight
path for arrival at Mars in October as it performed its second
trajectory correction maneuver this morning.

<p>Odyssey fired its thrusters for 23 seconds at 9:30 a.m.
Pacific time, which changed the spacecraft's velocity by 0.9
meters per second (about 2 miles per hour).

<p>"Today's successful trajectory correction maneuver marks
the completion of the mission's early cruise phase," said
David A. Spencer, mission manager for 2001 Mars Odyssey at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. "All science payloads have
been checked out and are operating well."

<p>The Odyssey flight team, he said, is now turning its
focus to preparations for Mars orbit insertion and
aerobraking, in which repeated passage through the upper
atmosphere of the planet will be used to adjust the
spacecraft's orbit.

<p>Last week, the team opened the door on the gamma ray
spectrometer, managed by the University of Arizona in Tucson,
and started taking data with the gamma sensor head. Initial
data indicate that the detector performance is excellent.
Odyssey is currently about 35 million kilometers (about
22 million miles) from Earth and traveling at a speed of about
27 kilometers per second (about 59,800 miles per hour)
relative to the Sun.<br>
<br>

<b><u>Tuesday, October 30, 2001</u></b>

<p>NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft took its first
thermal infrared temperature image of Mars at approximately
1300 Universal time (5 a.m. Pacific time) today.  The imaging
team at Arizona State University, Tempe will process the data
over the next couple of days and hopes to release the image
later this week.  This morning's image is part of the
calibration process for the thermal emission imaging system
and is designed to help determine that the imaging system is
working properly.   The main science mapping mission is
expected to begin in early February 2002.

<p>Flight controllers report the aerobraking phase is
proceeding as planned.  The first aerobraking pass, when the
spacecraft slowly dips into the martian atmosphere to slow
itself down, began on schedule last Friday night.  Today,
Odyssey is in its ninth pass around Mars.  During its closest
approach, the spacecraft is 128 kilometers (nearly 80 miles)
above the surface and during its farthest point is 27,000
kilometers (nearly 17,000 miles) away from Mars.  Currently,
Odyssey is in an elliptical orbit and aerobraking will
circularize its path during the next three months.

<p>Following the orbit insertion last week, scientists
turned on the high-energy neutron detector and the neutron
spectrometer to check out and validate the instruments during
the course of three orbits.  Both instruments functioned well.
Neutrons were successfully measured during each close pass by
the planet.  Those instruments have since been turned off.<br>
<br>

<b><u>Wednesday, October 31, 2001</u></b>

<p>NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey gave mission managers a real
treat this Halloween with its first look at the red planet.
It's a thermal infrared image of the martian southern
hemisphere that captures the south polar carbon dioxide ice
cap at a temperature of about minus 120 C (minus 184 F).

<p>The spacecraft first entered orbit around Mars last week
after a six-month, 460- million-kilometer (285-million-mile)
journey.

<p>The image, taken as part of the calibration and testing
process for the instrument, shows the nighttime temperatures
of Mars, demonstrating the "night-vision" capability of the
camera system to observe Mars even when the surface is in
darkness.

<p>"This spectacular first image of Mars from the 2001 Mars
Odyssey spacecraft is just a hint of what's to come," said Dr.
Ed Weiler, associate administrator for space science at NASA
Headquarters in Washington, D.C. "After we get Odyssey into
its final orbit it will be much closer to Mars than when it
took this image, and we'll be able to tell whether or not
there are any hot springs on Mars, places where liquid water
may be close to the surface. If there are any such locations
they would be places we might like to explore on future
missions."

<p>The image covers a length of more than 6,500 kilometers
(3,900 miles), spanning the planet from limb to limb, with a
resolution of approximately 5.5 kilometers per pixel (3.4
miles per pixel), at the point directly beneath the
spacecraft.

<p>The spacecraft was approximately 22,000 kilometers (about
13,600 miles) above the planet looking down toward the south
pole of Mars when this image was taken.
<p>It is late spring in the martian southern hemisphere. The
extremely cold, circular feature shown in blue is the martian
south polar carbon dioxide ice cap , which is more than 900
kilometers (540 miles) in diameter at this time and will
continue to shrink as summer progresses. Clouds of cooler air
blowing off the cap can be seen in orange extending across the
image.

<br>

<b><u>Tuesday, November 13, 2001</u></b>

<p>NASA's 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft has now entered the
main aerobraking phase of the mission.

<p>"The initial phase of aerobraking has gone exceedingly
well.  By skimming through the upper reaches of the Mars
atmosphere during each orbit, we have reduced our orbital
period by more than three hours in the past two weeks," said
David A. Spencer, the Odyssey mission manager at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.  Odyssey's orbital
period, the time required for the spacecraft to complete one
revolution in its orbit around Mars, is currently 15 hours.

<p>The spacecraft's closest approach to the planet, know as
the orbit's periapsis, has been carefully lowered to 110
kilometers (68 miles) above the martian surface.  "This
closest approach occurs over the north polar region on Mars,
in a relatively low density region surrounded by strong winds
like the jet stream on Earth," said Dr. Richard Zurek of JPL,
who chairs the aerobraking advisory group.  "Like Earth, Mars
has distinct seasons, and this low density area, called the
polar vortex, develops each fall and will persist until
spring, long after Odyssey has finished aerobraking,"

<p>NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft is monitoring the
lower atmosphere of Mars, observing the entire planet each day
to watch for dust storms and weather events that could affect
the upper atmosphere.  If needed, Odyssey could also use its
own instruments to watch for dust storms. To that end, flight
controllers have completed the calibration and testing of the
thermal emission imaging system.  The imaging team at Arizona
State University, Tempe, took the first visible wavelength
image of the planet on Nov. 2, which complements the thermal
infrared image that was taken earlier.

<p>The aerobraking phase is planned for completion in late
January 2002.  At that point, Odyssey will be in its desired
circular orbit, and the science mapping mission will begin
sometime in early February
