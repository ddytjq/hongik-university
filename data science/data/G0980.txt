<h3>Updates in February, 2002</h3>

<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> This two year interval is as long as I've waited to update the essays. 
 Here is what I said the last time I updated this file in May 2000: 
<blockquote>
<font color=navy>
 When I published the first series of essays on the internet
in the fall of 1997, the Veron Quasar Catalogue was in the 7th edition. 
 In 1998 the 8th edition was placed on the web, and last March (2000) the
9th edition appeared on the internet.   The absolute luminosity of quasars
listed in the catalogue is critical because it will be affected by the curvature
of space near the antipode, if there is one.   In theory, the quasars will
pass through a <em>maximum in luminosity</em> at the same time they are passing
through a <em>minimum in the number counts</em>, if that intriguing antipode
affects the quasar population at high red shifts. 
  <p> Each <a href="http://www.obs-hp.fr/www/catalogues/veron2_9/node2.html">
subsequent edition</a> of the Veron Quasar Catalogue has roughly 2,000 more
quasars than the previous one, and the higher counts of quasars at large
red shifts are particularly useful in trying to determine the approximate
distance/red shift of the antipode (again, assuming it's <em>there</em>).
  Most people will probably find the quasar table at the beginning of Essay
#7 rather interesting, as I do.   This table is updated each time there is
a new edition of the Veron Quasar Catalogue.   (It's a tedious process to
tabulate the quasars by red shift, but yields a very fascinating table.) </p>
</font>  
</blockquote>
 
  <p> <IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Well, I learning... </p>
  <p> <IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The manual "tedious process" I referred to has been replaced by a modern
spreadsheet and an infinitely more intelligent use of VizieR (a way to query
thousands of catalogues). &nbsp; And it is essential to have a more efficient
way to analyze the quasars because the ninth edition of the Veron catalogue
with over 10,000 quasars is now history; it has been superseded by the 10th
edition last spring which has over 20,000 quasars. &nbsp; (The dramatic increase
is due to huge numbers of quasars discovered in two surveys. &nbsp; That
prediction of a dramatic increase from the two surveys were made in the Introduction to the 9th
edition of the Veron catalogue in the above link.) &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
  <p> <IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>I probably spent at least 80% of my time on this go around working
up a series of quasar tables.   You may not agree with my interpretation
of what I think they imply, but I believe you will agree that the data is
presented in a way that's easy to comprehend. &nbsp; One table of quasars
at the highest red shifts is presented in Essay #7, and there's a new appendix
where I insert&nbsp; several more tables of quasars so you can put what happens
at the higher red shifts in better perspective.&nbsp; <a name="absorbers">
&nbsp; </a> </p>
  <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>  Keeping in mind that I believe that the universe is a "closed cosmic
hypersphere" with Riemannian space, here's something else that appeared in
the last update in May 2000: </p>
  <blockquote>
<font color=navy> The intervening hydrogen clouds - called "absorbers" and discussed
in Essay #8 - are also very interesting in this model. &nbsp; They show up
as absorption lines "blue-shifted" (closer) than the quasars which "illuminate"
them. &nbsp; The farther astronomers probe at higher red shifts, the larger
these clouds seem to become. &nbsp;&nbsp; The huge size is presenting a problem
as these clouds&nbsp; should not be anywhere near this large in the presumably
smaller universe we probe into in deep space. 
    <p> The "wiggle room" many astronomers give themselves is to assume they
are seeing different parts of a long string like filamentary structure, whereas
my hunch is that they are detecting&nbsp; different parts of the same enlarged
pancake cloud, whose size is exaggerated by the curvature of space near the
antipode. </p>
</font>
    </blockquote>
 
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>    That was not a bad call either, as you will see if you wade through
this up to Essay #8. </p>
    <p> 
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Finally, here's something pulled from a previous update in April
1999: </p>
    <blockquote>
<font color=navy> At the current moment, as more objections arise to the flat
Friedmann model, it is beginning to lose its preeminent place among the models,
and alternate cosmologies are being examined.   For example, the December
29, 1998, issue of the New York Times had an article in the weekly science
section discussing the matter necessary to bring the density up to the desired
critical level.   It referred to the January issue of Scientific American,
and the following comments are from  Dr. Lawrence M. Krauss at Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland at the close of his  article:  
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote> "The standard cosmology of the 1980's, postulating a flat
universe dominated by matter, is dead.   The universe is either open or filled
with an energy of an unknown origin.   Although I believe the evidence in
favor of the latter, either scenario will require a dramatic new understanding
in physics."
</font>
 </blockquote>
 
        <p> </p>
        </blockquote>
Most astronomers continue to believe the universe is "flat" (or doesn't miss by too much), but they have to do some finnagling with the numbers to get that flatness.   The usual baryonic matter - what you and I studied in classical physics and chemistry - comes to no more than 5%, at most, of the matter required for flatness.   So to get this desired flat universe, astronomers have to assume considerable amounts of "cold dark matter" and even more "negative energy". 
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Five years ago, Einstein's "cosmological constant" was considered to be kooky idea, even by Einstein himself during his lifetime.   Today, most realistic models <em>have</em> to assume it's there - it's that "negative energy" above - and this is the first time I've used a cosmological constant in the assumptions necessary to calculate what's going on with the quasars in Essay #7.   And a link to an interesting site which allows you to incorporate this idea into various other assumptions
about the universe is given at the start of Essay #3. 
        <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>A few notes on esthetics and mechanics:
<blockquote>
<ol><li>You'll notice something unusual in the text<strong>:</strong> the paragrahs are indented.   There's a way to do this in Netscape with a "spacer" command, but that command is not recognized using the Internet Explorer browser.   Both browsers recognize the "make room for an image" command (even if the one line image isn't there).   Adding the paragraph indents was a good excuse for me to check the text one more time.
<p>
<li>The Greek characters so common in mathematics and geometry are unfortunately handled differently on the two primary browsers (Netscape and Internet Explorer).   I tried to strike a happy compromise by providing frequent reminders of the problem and by switching between the two browsers from time to time.   I also added Appendix 11 which displays the Greek characters correctly on each browser, so you know what they look like on the one you use.
<p>
<li>Anytime there's a table or an appendix, I put the link to that file in the table of contents.   So if there's link to an appendix from one of the main essays that you want to check out later, just go to the table of contents and chances are the title of the appendix will jog your memory.
