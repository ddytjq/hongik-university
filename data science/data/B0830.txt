	  <p><EM>16th May 2002</EM></p>
      <p><STRONG> </STRONG>Chelsea Building Society has announced the withdrawal 
		of the 1 Year Fixed Rate Bond (19th Issue) and the 2 Year Fixed Rate Bond 
		(12th Issue) on Friday 17th May 2002. Chelsea will also be launching two 
		new fixed rate bonds, the 1 Year Fixed Rate Bond (20th Issue) and 2 Year 
		Fixed Rate Bond (13th Issue) on Saturday 18th May 2002. </p>
	  <p>The new <strong>1 Year Fixed Rate Bond (20th Issue)</strong> will feature 
		an interest rate of <strong>4.60% gross pa/<acronym title="Annual Equivalent Rate">AER</acronym><sup><font size="1">1</font></sup></strong> 
		(3.68% net pa<sup><font size="1">1</font></sup>) FIXED until 4th September 
		2003 for investments of &pound;1,000 and above. The interest rate for 
		monthly income will be 4.51% gross pa<sup><font size="1">1</font></sup> 
		(3.61% net pa<sup><font size="1">1</font></sup>) and is approximately 
		equivalent to annual interest when compounded. The <strong>AER<sup><font size="1">1</font></sup></strong> 
		for monthly interest is <strong>4.60%</strong>. From 5th September 2003 
		the variable rate of interest is guaranteed to be at least the same as 
		that which applies to our then current issue of Instant Option.</p>
	  <p>The new <strong>2 Year Fixed Rate Bond (13th Issue)</strong> will pay 
		a rate of <strong>5.10% gross pa/AER<sup><font size="1">1</font></sup></strong> 
		(4.08% net pa<sup><font size="1">1</font></sup>) FIXED until 8th September 
		2004 for investments of &pound;2,500 and above. The interest rate for 
		monthly income will be 4.98% gross pa<sup><font size="1">1</font></sup> 
		(3.98% net pa<sup><font size="1">1</font></sup>) and is approximately 
		equivalent to annual interest when compounded. The <strong>AER<sup><font size="1">1</font></sup></strong> 
		for monthly interest is <strong>5.10%</strong>. From 9th September 2004, 
		the variable rate of interest is guaranteed to be at least the same as 
		that which applies to our then current issue of Instant Option. </p>
	  <p>In respect of both accounts the first annual interest payment date will 
		be 1st February 2003 and annually on 1st February thereafter. Whether 
		the interest is paid monthly or annually on 1st February, interest can 
		be added to the account, transferred to another Chelsea account or to 
		a bank account.</p>
	  <p>Whilst some fixed rate accounts do not permit any withdrawals during 
		the fixed rate term both the new 1 Year Fixed Rate Bond (20th Issue) and 
		2 Year Fixed Rate Bond (13th Issue), will feature a withdrawal facility 
		in case of an unexpected need for funds. </p>
	  <p>Investors will be able to make immediate withdrawals by cash or cheque, 
		although this will incur 60 days' loss of interest on the amount withdrawn 
		(which will reduce the quoted <strong>AER<sup><font size="1">1</font></sup></strong>). 
		Investors will be able to make notice and penalty free withdrawals from 
		the 1 Year Fixed Rate Bond (20th Issue) from 4th September 2003 (after 
		the fixed rate period) and from the 2 Year Fixed Rate Bond (13th Issue) 
		from 8th September 2004 (after the fixed rate period).</p>
