            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Hennessy, 
              well-known as the soccer player-turned-runner, took advantage of 
              the title opportunity presented by a race field limited by last 
              week's World Half and depleted from late-stage drop-outs to injury 
              and illness.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;After 
              I heard that Milena (Glusac, the defending champ) had dropped out 
              (due to the flu), I knew I had a good shot at it,&quot; Hennessy 
              said of the U.S. title, which turned out to be her first. &quot;I 
              don't know many runners yet, but I do know Sylvia (Mosqueda), Milena, 
              Deena (Drossin) and some of the other runners who ran here last 
              year. Not seeing them at the starting line, you know that it opens 
              things up a bit.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Hennessy 
              battled with Teresa Wanjiku for the race win until the final half-mile. 
              The Kenyan won in 1:26:57 to Hennessy's 1:27:18. Following Hennessy 
              in the U.S. and open competition were Beth Olds, in 1:29:30 and 
              Lori Stich Zimmerman in 1:32:23.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;We 
              kept surging on each other, the lead kept changing, and I got a 
              little gap on her on the hill at thirteen,&quot; Hennessy said of 
              her duel with Wanjiku. &quot;I thought maybe I could surge ahead 
              but she covered it. She covered everything I tried.&quot;</font></p>

              for his part, used strong hill running in the race's second half 
              to dispose of final challenger Gabriel Muchiri. Mogaka's near-record 
              run timed 1:13:56 (tied for #3 all-time), just a lone second short 
              of the global mark. Muchiri finished second in 1:15:37, followed 
              by the world record holder himself, Joseph Kariuki, third in 1:16:11. 
              Kariuki set his mark of 1:13:55 at the 1998 River Bank Run. (Kariuki's 
              record, it should be noted, is inferior <br>
              to the as-yet unratified mark of Rodgers Rop at Berlin last year,
