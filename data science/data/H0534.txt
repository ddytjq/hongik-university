CREATIVE THINKING <br>
<br>
by <br>
J. R. Pierce <br>
</center>

</center>
<p>
I have been asked to talk to you about creative thinking. While I am glad
to do this, I feel some trepidation about discussing a non-technical subject,
and I think I should tell you why.
<p>
It seems to me that engineering and science are sharply set apart from
all other fields of human activity.  If I tell you that a certain theory
predicts the behavior of electrons or neutrons, or that a network designed
in such and such a way will have such and such properties, you can check
my statements by observing the particles or by testing the network. In contrast,
even a historian or a witness to an event can offer you only his documents
or his word to testify that what he recounts actually happened. You can't
check by making an experiment. When one deals, as I shall, with surmises
about partially-known experiences and events, you will be still farther
from being able to verify what I say. If I put forth an idea as being plausible,
you should be forewarned that people in other times and other places have
found witchcraft and astrology to be plausible, and a host of other things
which we regard as ridiculous. If I pose as an expert in creative thinking
or as an authority on creative thinking, I should at least warn you that
I have heard people whose individual actions and decisions I respect greatly
give forth generalizations and analyses for which I had much less respect.
<br>
<br>

<p>
Although I talk with some trepidation, I have no real pangs
of conscience. I will be honest and thoughtful to the best of
my ability, and I have warned you. Thus, despite my doubts, I
shall thoroughly enjoy talking about creative thinking.
People like to discuss ill-understood problems which seem
more "human" and more "profound" than the technical details
of engineering and science. I hope that some day someone will
be able to talk about creative thinking in a sounder way than
I am able to, but he will probably get less pleasure from his
science than I shall from my fancy.
<p>
The other part of my trepidation has another cause. Suppose
that what I say is true and wise and constitutes good advice.
What is the use of saying it? Through a good while at the
Bell Laboratories I have seen certain people, figuratively,
of course, hitting themselves on the heads with hammers,
sawing off their noses, trying to walk through brick walls,
riding off rapidly in all directions at once, lying under the
flapdoodle trees waiting for the fruit to fall in their
mouths, and generally behaving in what seem to me
uninstructed if not irrational manners. Surely, someone must
have told them better. Sometimes I've tried to myself. Yet
year after year they pursue the same courses. What good does
it do to tell people non-technical things, anyway?. You may
be able to persuade a man to add 2 and 2 and get 4 rather
than 5, but can his conduct in more general matters be
influenced? I don't know, and if it can't, maybe that is a
good thing. In any event, I
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<center> -

 - </center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
don't intend to let this doubt as to the utility of what I say dull my
pleasure in saying it.
<p>
With these warnings and explanations, I propose to tell you how I feel about
creative thinking. Don't believe me if you don't want to. Don't expect to
get
much good out of what I say. I hope it gives you some pleasure.
<p>
I think the words of the subject deserve a little attention,
although I don't intend to give them a precise meaning. I
think of creative thinking as referring to the fact that
something has been created through thought. In our case, it
may be a physical theory; the understanding of a class of
phenomena; it may be an invention; it may be a way of getting
around a difficulty; it may be an overall or a detailed
design for a communication system.  What I want to do is to
distinguish
<u>creative</u>
from original and especially from
<u>bizarre</u>
<!-- there were two 'or's here, because one was at the end of a line
and the other was at the start and humans don't catch these easily.

or
<u>novel</u>.
To me, creative thinking produces
something substantial and reasonably permanent, something
which may be understanding, art, or a piece of equipment.
<p>
Now, not all substantial accomplishments are the results
of thinking. A dictator may have a whole class of people
liquidated; an executive may order that no one with more than
ten years' service shall achieve district status.  The results
produced in such cases can be substantial and reasonably
permanent, but thinking is not necessarily involved.
<p>
In considering creative
<u>thinking</u>,
I associate thinking with
that ordered progress which we see so clearly in engineering
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<center> - 
4
 - </center>
<p>
and science and which we may find lacking in many other fields of human
endeavor.
<p>
In navigation, the quadrant marks a clear advance over the
astrolabe, and the sextent marks an even greater advance over
the quadrant. A vacuum tube of today is just plain better
than a vacuum tube of 1920, and the same thing is true of
today's refrigerator. Today, through wave mechanics, we
understand things about the motions of electrons and about
the constitution of atoms which were completely hidden from
us thirty years ago.
<p>
In engineering and science, progress is evident in a series
of steps, each of which adds to what we already know or to
what we already have done or can do. It is a great part of
the satisfaction of one who works in these fields to
contribute to this progress. It is of this progress, this
adding to our technical capabilities and knowledge, that I
associate the words creative thinking,
<p>
When I think back over fifteen years at the Bell Laboratories
and consider the examples of creative thinking which I have
seen, one thing which strikes me most forcibly is the variety
of people who have added to our technical capabilities and
knowledge, and the variety of ways in which they have done
this creative thinking. People are widely different and
sometimes exasperatingly different. Moreover, the difference
is not so much that some people can do one job and others
can't; it is that some people will do a job in one manner and
others in
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<center> - 
5
 - </center>
<p>
another. When we add the fact that there are many ways to achieve a
particular piece of creative thinking to the fact that there are many sorts
of creative thinking to be done, generalization becomes very difficult and
it
is perhaps best to
turn to particular examples.
<p>
As one rather extreme case, I know a man at the Bell
Laboratories who has a record of turning up one good thing
after another. One can describe his field roughly by saying
that he works on small component parts. He works in a
diversely equipped laboratory and shop, with the aid of a
technical assistant, and there he not only invents devices
and processes, but he makes samples and even whole lots for
other people to work with.
<p>
I find this man a very puzzling phenomenon. He works with
devices and processes which to me seem bewilderingly complex.
Of all the multitude of things which he might try, he has
some way of hitting on the right things, time after time. He
must have some guiding principle of creative thinking which
helps him. I find this particularly striking because I have
talked with him about his work repeatedly, and I have never
got the slightest clue to his way of thinking.
<p>
I suppose that the uninitiated might say that anyone messing
around in a laboratory will come up with something new and
useful. Experience shows that this just isn't so.  For
experimental work to be fruitful, there must be choice as to
what is tried and the results of experiments must be
evaluated.
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<center> -

 - </center>
<p>
It is clear that the man of whom I am speaking is doing creative thinking
of
a high order. The fact that I cannot fully understand the nature of his
creative thinking shows a lack in me, not in him.
<p>
Does this man represent an important aspect of creative
thinking? I know several men around the Bell Laboratories who
are much like this. But even more important, I think that the
thing on which the man I have described relies so strongly
helps many of us in some lesser degree. I think I could even
cite a homely example of this.
<p>
Once upon a time a man started to build an elaborate
oscilloscope. When it was almost complete and was working in
a halting fashion, he left the Bell Laboratories and went to
work for Hughes, where he lived happily ever after. The
oscilloscope was turned over to a T.A. for debugging. Instead
of improving, the device suffered a series of relapses until
it wouldn't function at all.  At this point it was turned over
to another T.A., who is now a T.S.A, by the way. The
oscilloscope took a miraculous upturn and was working well in
a week or so. In my estimation, this showed at least some
creative thinking on the part of the TA.
<p>
We can describe the sort of thinking I have been discussing
by a name if we wish: intuition; skill; art. I am even
willing to speculate on its ingredients. Partly, I think it
grows through long familiarity. A boy who plays with erectors
and graduates through hot rods will acquire a feel
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<center> - 
7
 - </center>
<p>
for things mechanical. He learns by some informal and partly unconscious
process. For such learning, I think that both interest and long acquaintance
are necessary. I believe that something else is necessary as well; innate
ability.
<p>
This type of intuitive thinking is extremely valuable.  How are
we to get enough of it? I can't give any directions for
teaching it or practicing it; I think that we can only
recognize it where it occurs and value it highly. We must to
some extent take it as it is. In the fairy story, the man
killed the goose that laid the golden egg in a foolish
investigation of the source. Intuitive thinkers must be
treated tenderly if they are to continue to function. One
might even extend the parallel, and invent a man who despised
the goose because it couldn't tell how it made the golden
egg. In this connection, I can only drag up two old saws;
"gold is where you find it"; and, with some possible
confusion of thought, "don't look a gift horse in the mouth."
<p>
Because I have praised and valued intuitive thinking, even in
extreme forms, you may wonder whether I am advising you to
practice it. The answer is, not unless you can. I do say, by
no means despise it. A device can be good, an invention can
be valuable even when its author cannot explain it to
another's satisfaction, But for heaven's sake, don't try this
approach unless you know by experience that you are good at
it.
<p>
Let us turn to another sort of creative thinking. I know one
man who sits in an office and makes marks on pieces
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<center> - 
8
 - </center>
<p>
of paper.  He thinks about other people's experiments. He makes up
mathematical theories which purport to tell, in terms of known physical
laws,
what ought to happen when experiments are performed. He analyzes experimental
results and tries to find out what caused them. He can explain to any
competent man in detail just what he has done and why he did it, although
one
may still wonder what inspired him to do it.
<p>
Is this man's thinking a mere gloss on someone else's work;
is it only an explanation of what we already know? No, it is
not. Sometimes this man finds that other's ideas about things
are just wrong-headed and misleading. In such cases he clears
up their confusion and reorients their thinking and their
work. In other cases he foresees consequences which others
have not thought of. When he formulates problems in
mathematical form they become simpler and less puzzling, and
he can foresee necessary consequences which would escape one
who thought in looser terms. Such a man can make discoveries
and inventions; these are not reserved for the intuitive
experimenter.
<p>
Such theoretical workers provide the backbone, the skeletal
structure of engineering and science, without which these
fields would collapse into an amorphous mass of unrelated
devices and facts. Without them we would not have that clear
and steady progress in art and understanding which
distinguishes engineering and science from other fields of
human endeavor,
<p>
Do I advise all of you to become theorists? There is
something to be said for this in a small way at least, for we
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<center> - 
9
 - </center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
know what the tools are. As opposed to an intuitive appreciation of things,
physics and mathematics can be taught by fairly straightforward methods.
But,
this is not necessarily true of the ability to use them. I have known people
with a good knowledge of physical laws, with an extensive knowledge of
mathematics and with considerable skill in its manipulation who simply didn't
know what to do with their knowledge. Such people either can't get started
on
a problem, or else they get hopelessly bogged down in details. Certainly,
you
shouldn't learn more mathematics and theory than you can digest, make your
own, and use effectively.
<p>
I have described two extreme sorts of people whom I have met;
very intuitive men who accomplish experimental results no one
knows how, and theorists who proceed by consistent and well
ordered reasoning. Of course, most of us have some of each of
these qualities. I am thinking at the moment of two people
who as nearly as I can see get their good ideas while carrying
out experiments; they are prompted to creative thinking
chiefly through the behavior of the apparatus they work with.
Yet, each of these men is quite capable of expressing what he
has done in clear-cut, even mathematical, terms. I think also
of a mathematician who with his own hands builds machines and
gadgets embodying his ideas.
<p>
I believe that this mixture of experimental insight and
theoretical understanding is perhaps the most successful
equipment for creative thinking. The 
<!--virture-->
virtue
of experiment
is
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<center> - 
10
 - </center>
<p>
that, however complex the situation, nature always knows the right answer,
by
definition, of course.  Anyone who works in a laboratory continually
encounters unexpected phenomena, and some of these the creative thinker
can
recognize, foster and turn to use.
<p>
On the other hand, theoretical or analytical ability can in
itself be both a guide to understanding new phenomena and a
means for deducing something useful from something which
might otherwise be merely new and puzzling.
<p>
What I have said so far has been about types of people and
their methods of tackling problems. The problems themselves
are worthy of consideration.  Under what circumstances do
people exercise their power of creative thought? How do new
ideas and things arise?  Here I would like to cite a
particular, minor, personal example, and I will follow it
with others.
<p>
Over ten years ago I was working on a type of tube using an
electron beam. No one had a method of design which took
space-charge into account and produced a gun of predictable
properties. I worried about the matter for some time and
finally I thought of a means of design.  I spent quite a
while working this out theoretically and convincing myself
and others that it was sound. Then I wrote a paper describing
it and published it in the Journal of Applied Physics.
Certainly, something was created here, for I have found that
practically everyone who works with dense electron beams
makes use of my work.
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<center> - 
11
 - </center>
<p>
In this case the thing which was created was really a
published article which helped other people to design
electron guns. The tube I was working on never came to
anything. The bare idea of the gun wasn't the end product,
for I later found that a friend of mine had speculated about
the same idea, but he hadn't worked it out or written about
it.
<p>
One moral I would like to draw from this illustration is that
any challenging job can be a spur to creative thinking. I
didn't set out to do something new or something clever; I was
forced to think by being faced with a problem which I took
seriously and wanted to solve.
<p>
Of course, to serve as a stimulus a job must be a real and an
interesting challenge to the man who works on it. Some men
seem to find no challenge in fields they haven't read about
in the newspapers or heard commended in college. I think that
this is unfortunate and worth thinking about.
<p>
Surprisingly interesting things can come out of jobs which
may seem very prosaic. Claude Shannon's application of
Boolean algebra to switching problems may seem to some more
interesting than the original problems. Shannon's work on
communication theory might provide another example. From what
I know, this was inspired by some discussions of novel ways
of modulation such as mixtures of amplitude and phase
modulation, and finally pulse-code modulation, Today,
communication theory is a broad field related to physics,
psychology and I don't know
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<center> - 
12
 - </center>
<p>
what all.  I myself have been led to far and interesting fields in connection
with traveling-wave tubes, yet as far as I am concerned, as much as anything
this arose through repeated insistence on the part of Ralph Bown that
resonant circuits limit the bandwidth of vacuum tube amplifiers and that
someone should do something about it.
<p>
I have said that work on a challenging job can inspire
creative thinking, but you will note that an initial
inspiration is not enough; one must do something about his
insights and ideas in order to create anything. In the case
of the new means for designing an electron gun, I at least
worked out some of the ideas and published a paper, while a
friend who had the same general ideas but less interest in
the matter did nothing. Ideas which are not developed and
carried to some conclusion become as if they never had been.
The process of creative thinking can easily be interrupted
before anything is really created, and in such cases whatever
time and effort have been expended are totally lost.
<p>
Some simple, isolated ideas can be worked out and given
physical form or published by one man in a short time.  In
other cases the process of creation is long and necessarily
involves many people. I think particularly about some aspects
of the L3 carrier development, and about the work that led to
the 416A microwave triode.
<p>
An example drawn from the L3 development is the application of quality
control and statistical methods to every
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<center> - 
13
 - </center>
<p>
vital component used in the system and to the system as a whole.  For one
thing, this meant that everyone working directly on the project had to keep
continually in mind the meaning and details of this approach. For another
thing, those who worked directly on the project had to cooperate closely
with
groups which produced components such as, for example, vacuum tubes. For
the
first time, specifications were put on all tube parameters affecting system
performance, and for the first time tolerances were set on the basis of
control limits of a process which was known to be in control.
<p>
I am in no position to go into further details here, but the
point is that this seemingly simple idea of applying quality
control in system design could be called into real existence
only through persistent work over a period of years by a
whole group of people.
<p>
Another example is provided by the development of the 416A
triode. The original and startling germ of a creative idea
was that after all these years a triode might still be the
best amplifier for microwaves, if only the spacing were close
enough and the grid fine enough. An auxiliary idea was that
close enough spacings could be attained and held by grinding
the cathode and a surrounding ceramic co-planar, and then
supporting the grid from the ceramic. These were, however,
mere germs of an idea. Something real and complete was
brought into existence only after years of concentrated
effort, including the inauguration of a program of cathode
studies which is still being pursued for other purposes.
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<center> - 
14
 - </center>
<p>
My position so far has been that one needs some ability,
intuitive or theoretical, and preferably both, for creative
thinking. Frequently, one needs the inspiration of working
hard on a job. One further needs the persistence to bring an
idea into real being. There is, of course, more than this:
one needs the right environment; the right job.
<p>
I believe that there are certain general specifications which
an environment should meet to foster creative thinking. For
one thing, a man should get credit, encouragement and reward
if he does produce good, new things. He should feel that his
supervisor is helping him and advertising his success, not
competing with him or exploiting him. If the man is in a
position to exploit his idea himself, he should be allowed
to; if it must be turned over to someone else, the originator
should get his fair share of credit. In any event, he should
be encouraged to publish what he has done, for his own good
and for the good of the Bell Laboratories.
<p>
For another thing, a man should not be plagued with any irrelevant matters
which he can be spared. It is hard enough for him to keep the technical
part
of a job in hand and to take care    of his personal relations with other
technical men. To encounter red tape or inefficiency or inadequacy in
purchasing, in shops, in space allocations and changes, in personnel matters,
and,    especially, in interdepartmental relations cannot help but have
   a
bad effect.
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<center> -

 - </center>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
What about actual physical working arrangements? Some of the
best work of which I know has been done in gloomy, dirty,
noisy and even crowded university laboratories. This of
course shows a certain triumph of the intellectual or
spiritual over the physical, and indeed I believe that the
matters I have mentioned a little earlier are much more
important than are physical surroundings.
<p>
It seems to me reasonable that one should have good physical
surroundings if his employers can afford them. Some people
may be sensitive to noise, and why should a laboratory or an
office be noisy? Some people may be sensitive to heat, and
air conditioning is nice if one can afford it. Personally,
except for some cases in which certain standards are set by
technical requirements of special jobs, I regard the nature
of surroundings as something to be chosen more with regard to
custom, decency, and respect for people as human beings, than
with regard to their influence on quality or quantity of
work. If I were to make a personal choice as to surroundings,
I would like most of all authority to change and arrange them
to suit convenience, without regard to general plans or
rules. I think that this is something which can easily be
overlooked by people who no longer do laboratory work.
<p>
These general matters of satisfactory supervision,
satisfactory facilities and, perhaps, suitable physical
surroundings, I believe to be very important.  I think that
for most people the specific nature of the job they are asked
to do is of
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<center> - 
16
 - </center>
<p>
less importance. A person with some intuitive grasp of engineering and an
understanding of some basic physical laws and mathematics can tackle almost
any engineering problem and do creative work, granted the right general
atmosphere. There are, of course, exceptions. I believe that highly
exceptional people who have to be carefully fitted to a particular field
or
job are in the minority. I have no trouble thinking of examples, however;
people who succeeded after changing jobs where they had failed before, and
people whom I cannot imagine doing anything very much different from what
they are doing now.
<p>
For instance, an extremely intuitive person who thinks with
his hands in a laboratory is not the man to do long-range
systems planning. He belongs in a niche by himself, in
research or advanced development. A man with a really
profound knowledge of mathematics and broad interests
shouldn't be tied down to a single long-range project, where
he will soon have contributed everything his particular
talents have to offer. And, a small minority of workers seem
to be real self-starters, who break into intellectual
combustion spontaneously without the spur of a job and think
truly profound thoughts. In their exceptional case, a set
task is bad, rather than good, and they should not be
burdened with demands or instructions.
<p>
On the other hand, for each of such exceptional people I have
certainly seen at least one rather unsuccessful man who
didn't like and didn't work very hard at a job of which he
could have made something, but who longed for some other
work, and in
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<center> - 
 17
 - </center>
<p>
many cases for work which he could not do well. Occasionally such men do
produce a stream of ideas outside of their field, but most often the ideas
are not very good, because they don't strike at the heart of the problem,
and
the ideas are seldom worked out far enough to be anything but material for
conversation.
<p>
Now I have talked about types of ability, about a job as an
inspiration, about carrying ideas from a glimmering into real
being, and about working conditions and jobs. You may believe
that I have omitted the really vital point; granted some sort
of ability, some sort of problem and reasonably satisfactory
surroundings, how does one get the sort of idea that can
really advance the art and put us on territory where we
weren't before?
<p>
One source of ideas which no one should overlook is the ideas
of others. The world is full of half-born ideas; ideas that
came too soon; ideas that were not fully appreciated by the
men who had them; ideas that someone is trying to promote.  I
have got some of my very best ideas from other people,
usually through personal contact or current publication.
There must be many ideas in the technical literature of past
years, but in my personal experience these have most often
been turned up by the patent department to show that I hadn't
invented something when I thought I had. As an example of an
idea which I got from another, I will cite the
traveling-wave tube. In this case, I saw in a device which
was on the point of being abandoned as a solution for one
problem potentialities which other people seem to have been
blind to.
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<center> - 
18
 - </center>
<p>
Sometimes, however, one can't find what he wants by shopping
around. How, then, does one get an idea when he is forced to
have it himself? And how does he bring it from a germ of an
idea into true being?
<p>
Happily, there is much more agreement on this than one might
imagine. One gets new ideas by inspiration or accident, and
one tests, verifies and makes something of them by expert
knowledge and hard work.
<p>
Let me tell the story of a couple of my ideas. I don't claim
that they are very good ideas, but they are about as original
as any I have ever had.
<p>
One evening W. B. Hebenstreit and I were working late at the
Laboratories, on a book which, incidentally, never got
written. We had been trying to deduce mathematically the
effect on tube noise of the fact that an electron beam is
made up of electrons with many velocities. Because many
velocities were too much for our feeble mathematics, we
considered a beam composed of electrons of two velocities
only. We quickly deduced growing waves. The double-stream
amplifier had been conceived. It came into being through
further straightforward mathematical work and through
experimental work by A. V. Hollenberg. Finally, alas, it was
dropped because its alleged advantages came to appear
illusory.
<p>
For a number of years I have been interested in communication
theory. Because of this interest, I have repeatedly
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<center> - 
19
 - </center>
<p>
tried to concoct new and advantageous ways for encoding messages for
transmission. Some two years ago I had been thinking a lot about systems
with
a random element, which have certain alleged general advantages. One day
I
was talking casually with Claude Shannon, and he described to me in a few
words the system a worker outside of the Bell Laboratories had devised.
I
didn't pay much attention while he was talking, but something of what he
had
said stayed with me. Then, later in the day, I saw certain advantages of
this
new system. The next day I went to see Claude and told him that this was
a
fine idea.  As I explained the advantages, he agreed, but he observed that
the system I was describing wasn't the one he had told me about at all.
I had
invented a new system by listening carelessly and pursuing my own thoughts.
Since then I have done a good deal of analytical work and further "inventing"
in this connection and A.L.Hopper has made an experimental system.  I still
have hopes for this one.
<p>
While I had each of these ideas by accident, I had them only
because I had been thinking for a long time in the general
field and racking my brains for ways of doing things. Then,
suddenly, there was an idea.  Sometimes the idea or the
glimmering of an idea comes in a less accidental manner,
suddenly on the street as one did to the mathematician Henri
Poincare, or at night in bed. But it doesn't come without
adequate preparation. And, without adequate skill and
considerable effort, nothing will come of the
<!--imcomplete-->
incomplete
idea; inspiration and accident form only the starting point
of creation, not its accomplishment.

<p>
It is because of belief in this sort of genesis of
inspiration that I feel that interest in and hard work on a
job are more important than just what job it is. If your job
poses problems, if you take them seriously, if your boss
inspires and encourages you, then, granted even reasonable
ability, inspiration will come, and if you follow the
inspiration up with sound analysis and work you will have
created something.
<p>
Now I will admit that there is one catch to this. Sometimes
people have good ideas, or the germs of good ideas, outside
of the field of their immediate work, There are several
things which one can do in such a case.
<p>
One course is to write the idea down in your notebook,
perhaps to get it patented if you can, but to do nothing
further. Some day, someone who really needs the idea in his
work will have the idea independently and will really work it
out. At this point you can flaunt your notebook and perhaps
your patent in his face, his boss's face, your boss's face,
and so on. Such behavior may give a lot of satisfaction to
some people, but I don't see just what it accomplishes,
<p>
Another course is to seek out someone to whom you think the
idea might be of use and to try to sell the idea to him, or
rather, to give it to him. The important thing is to persuade
him to take it. As a secondary consideration, you may write a
memorandum, or a joint memorandum, or take out a patent if he
insists.
<p>
Sometimes you can't sell an idea. If the idea still seems
good to you, it is appropriate to state it clearly and as
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<center> -

 - </center>
<p>
completely as you can in a memorandum and send it to all the people you
think
might make use of it. Or, you can go further and publish it.
<p>
Sometimes an idea will seem so good and attractive that you
want to work on it yourself. If it's that good, your boss is
likely to be impressed with it himself, and so will other
people, and you will get a chance to work on it if you wish.
<p>
It seems to me that I have covered a lot of ground, and that
I ought to give some sort of brief summary and
drawing together of what I have said.  I will make this very
brief.
<p>
To me, creative thinking implies two things. First, something
reasonably substantial and enduring must be created, whether
this be embodied in a publication or a piece of apparatus.
Second, something must be added to the body of engineering or
science, something which can be clearly recognized as a step
forward.
<p>
Creative thinking can proceed either from a logical approach
to a problem, or through an intuitive grasp of it. In
exceptional people the logical or the intuitive elements
predominate very strongly. If you are one of these, you may
succeed only in a rather special sort of job. With a moderate
amount of both of these qualities you can do creative
thinking in connection with almost any job, provided that you
find the job challenging and that you aren't unduly
distracted by non-technical or irrelevant matters,
<p>
Things which make a job challenging are good general working
conditions and a good boss who inspires you, and who sees
that you get recognition and rewards.
<br>
<br>

<p>
There is a large element of inspiration and accident in the
genesis of creative ideas, but the inspiration doesn't come
and the accidents don't happen to people unless they are
prepared through hard work and hard thought.
<p>
Creative thinking doesn't end with the initial idea. Unless
one checks and analyzes the idea and reduces it to an
appropriate substantial form, which may be a publication or a
physical device, nothing has been accomplished.  Knowledge is
what people know, not what they have surmised or forgotten.
The ratio of inspiration and perspiration varies from
creative idea to creative idea, but the perspiration is
always there.
<p>
Finally, I might add that few satisfactions are so great for
the effort spent, or so enduring, as that of having taken a
real step ahead in engineering or science. In these pursuits
progress is real, and it is recognized and appreciated by all
the fraternity of workers. I believe that in no other field
of human endeavor can the average worker achieve as secure
and enduring a place through his creative accomplishments.
Next to good pay, this should be a considerable inspiration
and satisfaction to us.

<h1> Historical Notes</h1>

<p>
This talk was discovered by my father, Herbert Anton Schneider,
in his papers.  He was at Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ
when he heard it.  He wrote '1952' on the top, so presumably
he obtained the text
January of that year.
He sent me a copy.
</p>

<p>
John Pierce
<!--<a href = "letter.html">-->granted me permission
<!--</a>-->
to put the talk on the web
with no restraints or copyright reservations.
</p>

<p>
The pages were scanned
by a Microtek ScanMaker 4
on a
Power Macintosh 7600/120
with OmniPage Pro 8.0
and then edited into html.
</p>

<p>
To retain the flavor of the original text, which
was typewritten, I have kept
it broken by the original pagination.
I have made corrections indicated in the text.
There were a handful of other changes.  To avoid disrupting the flow
but to keep a record
since this is a historical 
document, I have put them into invisible HTML comments.
