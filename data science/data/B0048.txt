  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>1. THE SERVICES WE OFFER</b></font>
  <br>
  As a building society, our services fall broadly into
  three categories:

  <ul type=square>
    <li>Savings and investments
    <li>Mortgages and loans
    <li>Other related financial services
  </ul>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>SAVINGS AND INVESTMENTS</b></font>
  <br>
  The Barnsley Building Society offers a secure home
  for your savings with a range of attractive returns
  dependent upon the amount you wish to save and
  how quickly you wish to have access to your funds.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Instant Access Accounts</b></font>
  <br>
  These enable you to invest and withdraw money
  without having to give prior notice. Some offer tiered
  rates which offer a higher level of interest dependent
  upon the amount held within the account.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>High Interest Earning Accounts</b></font>
  <br>
  These accounts usually require you to give notice
  before you can withdraw funds, but they also give you
  the option of either waiting for the end of the notice
  period, or forfeiting the interest earned on the
  withdrawal if taken within the notice period. They
  have tiered rates which offer a higher level of interest
  dependent upon the amount invested in the account.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>ISA Accounts - Falcon Cash ISA & Falcon TESSA ISA</b></font>
  <br>
  We developed these accounts
  under government guidelines to be
  able to offer you a tax free method of
  saving. Falcon CASH ISA is a mini ISA
  developed for cash only. Falcon TESSA ISA is a
  tax free home for maturing TESSA capital only.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Monthly Income Accounts</b></font>
  <br>
  These accounts pay interest on a
  monthly basis at premium
  interest rates on sums
  starting at £10,000. They require specific
  notice periods for
  withdrawals but also
  carry the option of
  forfeiting the interest earned
  on the withdrawal, if it is
  taken within that period.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Falcon Flexi-Save</b></font>
  <br>
  Falcon Flexi-Save is our most flexible account offering a highly attractive rate. It
  allows for monthly saving, but does
  not restrict you to saving a set
  amount per month, nor do you have to
  save every month. You choose the amount
  you wish to save between £20.00 and £250.00 and when, with the only 
  restrictions being that just two withdrawals are
  permitted per calendar year and you make no more
  than one payment per month.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Age Specific Accounts</b></font>
  <br><br>
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Falcon First (AGES 0-16)</b></font>
  <br>
  This account caters for children’s
  savings from £1 up to £10,000. It
  offers instant access to the
  funds with no withdrawal
  penalties and an attractive interest
  rate regardless of the amount invested.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Falcon Club (AGES 16-23)</b></font>
  <br>
  This account caters for young
  adults from 16-23 who wish to
  save from £1 to £10,000. It
  offers instant access to funds
  with no withdrawal penalties
  and an attractive interest rate
  regardless of the amount
  invested. Other incentives are offered on account
  opening and at 17th, 18th and 21st birthdays.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Falcon 50 Years +</b></font>
  <br>
  This account caters for individuals aged 50 and over.
  It offers tiered interest rates which pay a higher level of
  return dependent upon the
  account balance. A monthly income
  option is also available for those wishing to take
  a regular income from their savings.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Affinity Accounts</b></font>
  <br>
  Affinity accounts have been developed with some
  local sporting clubs which have been branded to their
  own unique identities and aimed towards their supporters.
  The accounts all offer instant access and
  have one attractive interest rate on investments of
  £100 or more for adults and £10 or more for under 16's.
  The club also receives a bonus payment
  based upon the average balance held within all the
  accounts throughout the year.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Mortgages and Loans</b></font>
  <br>
  We have a selection of mortgage products which offer
  solutions to the wide range of requirements of today’s
  homebuyer. Our representatives will be pleased to
  discuss which scheme may be the most appropriate for
  your individual circumstances. We can also offer
  additional mortgage loans to existing borrowers for
  home improvements or other personal spending.
  <br><br>
  YOUR HOME IS AT RISK IF YOU DO NOT KEEP UP REPAYMENTS ON
  A MORTGAGE OR OTHER LOAN SECURED ON IT.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Insurances</b></font>
  <br>
  We arrange insurance cover for a wide range of risks for
  your home and its contents, which can also be extended
  to encompass caravans. We will also provide quotations
  for the cover of more specialised requirements should
  the need arise. Cover is arranged in conjunction with a
  major insurance company who can provide the best
  combination of protection and value.
  <br><br>
  
  The Society is also able to offer a specialist Loancare
  insurance which offers protection against accident,
  sickness and unemployment. Should any of these
  situations occur your mortgage payments will be
  covered for a set period.
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Travel Insurance</b></font>
  <br>
  We now offer a comprehensive annual travel insurance
  package which provides protection for holidays taken
  within the 12 month period, subject to certain
  requirements as laid out in the leaflet. The cost of the
  insurance can be paid in one amount or by direct debit
  over the year.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Travellers Cheques and Foreign Currency</b></font>
  <br>
  When travelling abroad you can order your American
  Express travellers cheques and foreign currency through
  any of our Branches.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Credit Cards</b></font>
  <br>
  We also offer our customers a Barnsley Building
  Society Credit Card which has the backing of
  Mastercard and is managed through MBNA
  International Bank Ltd, which is the world’s largest
  bank card issuer. In addition to many other benefits,
  our credit card has a low interest rate and attracts
  no annual fee.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Personal Loans</b></font>
  <br>
  We can offer a personal unsecured loan service to our
  customers through MBNA International Bank Ltd. The
  product offers an attractive rate for loans from £1,000
  to £15,000 over a period of 1 to 5 years.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>2. THE WAY WE WORK</b></font>
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Opening an Investment Account</b></font>
  <br>
  Before you open an account with us we will provide
  you with full written details of the product including
  Terms and Conditions, to ensure that they match your
  requirements. We will also provide current interest rate
  information.
  <br><br>

  Our investment application form also includes a
  section regarding <a class=s5 href="./charity.html" target=_top>Charitable Assignment</a>, which all
  new customers who wish to open accounts which
  provide membership to the Society, will be required to
  sign. Charitable Assignment is simply a declaration
  which assigns to the Charities Aid Foundation, any
  windfall conversion benefit to which they may become
  entitled. The agreement lasts for the first five years of
  membership. There are a few exceptions, with the
  large majority falling into the two categories of:

  <ol type=a>
    <li>All mortgage members
    <li>Existing investing members with accounts opened before the effective date
  </ol>

  <b>Personal Identity</b>
  <br>
  ONE of the following:
  <ul type=none>
    <li>Current Signed Passport
    <li>Current Full UK Driving Licence (Old Version) or Current UK Photo-Card Driving Licence
    <li>Benefit Book
    <li>Inland Revenue Tax Notification
    <li>Self-Employed in the Construction Industry - Tax Exemption Certificate with Photo of Holder

  </ul>

  We may carry out a voters roll
  check as additional confirmation of your permanent
  address.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Cooling Off Period</b></font>
  <br>
  If, after careful consideration, you decide that you are
  not happy with your choice of savings or investment
  account(s) and you bring this to our attention within 14
  days of your initial receipt, we will help you to either
  switch accounts or return your money with any interest
  earned over that period (please note any cheques paid in
  will have to clear before a refund can be given).
  We will ignore any notice
  periods and additional charges in these cases. Fixed
  rate accounts are excluded from this concession.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Joint Investment Accounts</b></font>
  <br>
  The Society is happy to set up joint access for most
  types of accounts when requested. However as a joint
  account is actually owned by two parties, there are
  subtle differences over a standard account opening.
  One of the parties must elect to be the Representative
  Joint Account Shareholder to receive Notices of
  Annual General Meetings, newsletters and updated
  information about that account. This person will be the
  first named person on the account passbook and will
  be able to attend meetings and vote.
  <br><br>

  In the unfortunate event of the death of one or other
  of the parties, the account will become the property of
  the remaining account holder. As such, the account will be
  transferred into the name of the
  remaining account holder for continuing use.
  <br><br>

  Note:	If the Society has been notified of cases of
  divorce, separation or dispute, the account will be
  frozen and no withdrawals will be allowed until both
  parties are able to authorise the relevant paperwork.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>How Interest is Calculated</b></font>
  <br>
  Interest is calculated on a daily basis, including the day of receipt
  but excluding the day of withdrawal. If you ask us, we will
  also give you a full explanation of how we work out interest.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Missing Passbooks</b></font>
  <br>
  <b>Please take care of your passbooks</b>
  <br>
  It is essential that you tell us as soon as you suspect or discover that
  your passbook has been lost or stolen by telephoning your Local Branch.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Mortgages and Loans</b></font>
  <br>
  <b>Choosing a Mortgage</b>
  <br>
  Information about the various types of mortgages
  available can be obtained by speaking to staff at
  any of our Branches. Under the Mortgage Code the
  Society offers three levels of service to all customers
  dealing direct with the Society to help them choose
  a mortgage, these being:-

  <ol>
    <li>Advice and recommendation as to which of our mortgage products is most suitable for you based on your particular requirements.
    <li>Information on the range of mortgage products we offer.
    <li>Information on a particular mortgage product from our range, if you have made up your mind already.
  </ol>

  We can also provide information on the particular
  mortgage chosen by customers who apply to the
  Society through a mortgage intermediary.
  <br><br>

  <b>Interest Rates</b>
  <br>
  The Society's traditional interest rate is variable, which
  means it can be changed upwards or downwards by the Society's
  Board of Directors. This rate is known as the Society's basic variable rate.
  The level of this rate depends on the current conditions in the financial market
  in which the Society operates.
  <br><br>

  For new borrowers, the Society usually offers a discount off the basic variable rate for an initial
  period, typically 2 or 4 years.
  <br><br>

  From time to time the Society may have available a fixed interest rate where the rate does not
  move either upwards or downwards for a certain period.
  <br><br>

  A capped rate may sometimes be available where the interest rate will not be
  higher than a given figure for a limited period. However, the interest rate on the capped mortgage will
  follow the Society's basic variable rate when it is below the capped rate.
  <br><br>

  Terms and conditions apply to the discount, fixed and capped interest rates which are notified to borrowers.
  After the agreed discount, fixed or capped rate period the interest rate changes to the Society's basic
  variable rate for the remaining term of the mortgage.
  <br><br>

  Full details of the various interest rates available can be obtained from any of the Society's branches.
  <br><br>

  <b>The Mortgage In Operation</b>
  <br>
  Whenever you borrow money from us, we will supply
  details of the conditions and costs involved.
  Subsequently, you will always be given at least 7 days
  notice of any change of interest rates and payments.
  <br><br>
  
  Shortly after the Society’s financial year end on 31st
  December each year, you will be sent a statement
  detailing the transactions made on your account
  during the past year.
  <br><br>

  <b>Changes in Terms and Conditions</b>
  <br>
  Occasionally terms and conditions regarding your mortgage may have to
  be changed. If this occurs, the Society would give you reasonable notice (of at least 30 days)
  in writing before implementation, explaining the nature of any change.
  <br><br>

  <b>Financial Difficulties</b>
  <br>
  Should your personal circumstances change and you experience difficulties in making repayments you
  should contact us quickly, as doing so will help us to try and make suitable arrangements before serious
  arrears develop.
  <br><br>

  The Society will be as sympathetic as possible in genuine cases of hardship.
  You can also get help and advice from debt counselling organisations. At your
  request and with your consent, we will liaise, wherever possible, with debt
  counselling organisations that we recognise, for example:
  <ul>
    <li>Citizens Advice Bureau, or
    <li>Money Advice Centres, or
    <li>The Consumer Credit Counselling Service
  </ul>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Charges and Fees</b></font>
  <br>
  Up-to-date information on any charges and fees
  associated with mortgage and investment accounts, as
  well as cheque clearance periods and rules
  concerning overdrawn accounts is contained in our
  "Charges and Fees" page.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Confidentiality</b></font>
  <br>
  We go to great lengths to protect the right to
  confidentiality of all our customers. We will treat all
  your personal information as private and confidential
  (even when you are no longer a customer). Nothing
  about your accounts nor your name and address will
  be disclosed to anyone, including other companies in
  our group, other than in four exceptional cases
  permitted by law. These are:

  <ul type=square>
    <li>If we have to give the information by law
    <li>If there is a duty to the public to reveal the information
    <li>If it is in our interests to give the information (but not for marketing purposes)
    <li>If you ask us to reveal the information, or if we have your permission
  </ul>

  You will be reminded every three years of your right to
  withdraw your consent to receive Marketing/Advertising material by notice in the Members'
  Newsletter - The Falcon.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Data Protection</b></font>
  <br>
  The Data Protection Act 1998 gives you the right to access
  your personal details held on file by organisations
  such as ourselves. We will be happy to allow you to
  have your own copy of these details when you confirm
  your request in writing, addressed to the Secretary, with
  your agreement to pay the relevant administration fee.
  Details of the fee can be found in our Charges and Fees 
  <a class=s5 href="./charges.html" target=_top>page</a>.

  <br>Financial Ombudsman Service</b></font>

  <br><br>

  when you feel that we may not have done this, and you may wish
  to make a complaint. We will always try to resolve any complaint
  speedily and at the earliest possible stage.
  <br>
  We will try to ensure that we resolve all our complaints
  by the close of business on the day after the complaint.

    <li>Arrange to discuss the problem with the
  appropriate Department or Branch Manager.

  within 14 days. Most of the very few complaints we receive are more often than not settled at this stage.

    <li>If you are still not satisfied, please write to the
  Assistant General Manager (Management
  Services/Compliance) at Head Office. He/She will investigate
  your complaint independently and will send you a written
  response within 14 days.

    <li>If this fails to produce agreement, you should
  write to the Chief Executive at Head Office who
  will review your case once more and issue our
  final decision within 14 days.

    <li>When you receive the final response from us and, 
  if you are not satisfied you should refer your complaint within 
  6 months of the date of the letter to the
