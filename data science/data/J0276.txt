<h1>Brainerd International Raceway</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Brainerd International Raceway is a multipurpose racing facility, including a
three-mile road course, located on a 400-acre site in central Minnesota north
of Brainerd, near North Long Lake.
BIR was originally known as Donnybrooke Speedway when it opened in 1963, the
name was changed with its sale in 1973.
BIR contains an NHRA-sanctioned drag strip, a go-kart course, and the road
course (which utilizes the full length of the drag strip and shutdown area as
part of the main straight).
Pro series and televised events are held each year on the dragstrip and the
road course.

<h2><a name="GettingThere">
Getting to Brainerd International Raceway</a></h2>

The track is northwest of Brainerd MN on Route 371, 5.3 miles north of Route
120, on the east side of the road.
<p>
The entrance is not all that clearly marked; there is a large sign by the
main gate but it is quite close to the ground and some distance from the main
road, and not always clearly distinguishable from other nearby signs (there
is a large filling station and convenience store on Route 371 immediately
north of the track entrance, where Route 371 bears west; if you pass this
while northbound you've gone too far).
Register and enter through the main gate if it is open, then turn left
immediately inside; the paddock is ahead about a quarter mile north.
If the main gate is closed, continue north on Birchdale Road (just outside the
track fence) to the first gate open into the track.
During test days held before major events, registration is inside the track.

A Racer's Guide to Brainerd International Raceway</a></h2>

<h3>The Paddock</h3>

It is not necessary to cross the track to enter or leave the paddock.
The paddock areas extend from the exit of Turn 9 northwards and then around
and east to the grandstands, and are grass over sand with paved access roads
and shaded areas (mostly oak trees, watch out for falling acorns).
Tech is in the smaller closed garage building at the east end of the paddock;
the scales are a good distance east along the return road from the pits to
the paddock.
All parts of the paddock are quite distant from the working pits, but pit
service vehicle parking is usually permitted in the pits.
Racing gasoline (114 AON leaded and 104 AON unleaded) is available from pumps
located behind the east end of the grandstand, a hundred yards or so east of
the paddock.
Air, water, rest rooms, showers, souvenirs, ice, and excellent food are
available in the paddock; air is also available from the tire concessions,
which are usually located at the northeast corner of the paddock.
Goodyear tire service is provided at selected events by Competition Tire West
from the permanent pad and shed (they send a small truck, not the semi; be
sure to place tire orders well in advance); Hoosier and Goodrich tire service
are also sometimes available.
There are electrical outlets in the garages at the east end of the paddock.
Reasonably-priced covered and enclosed garage space is available, contact the
track business office.
<p>
BIR hosts some very large spectator events, and the facilities reflect this.
Viewing areas around the entire track are easily accessible, a vehicle
overpass (just after Turn 9) and a pedestrian underpass (just east of the
tower) allow access into the inside of the course.

<h3>The Track</h3>

The road course is three miles long, has ten turns, and is quite wide around
its entire length -- the main straight is 60 feet wide.
There is essentially no elevation change.
Brainerd is a very high-speed course; CSR cars will reach speeds near 160 MPH
and take the slowest corners around 80 MPH.
There are wide runoff areas at most of the corners, but trees seem
frighteningly near the outside of the track at turns 3 and 8, and they
appear to approach closer as you go faster.
However, the local safety staff will assure you that cars going off the track
there do not actually reach the trees -- and will repeat that assurance as they
cheerfully recount their favorite hair-raising stories about cars which have
actually managed to do so.
<p>
The ground off the edge of the track is generally smooth, except for the
somewhat rutted runoff areas at the exit of Turns 2 and 3, curbs on the outsides
of the exits of Turns 4 through 8, and ditches and low (2- to 3-foot) banks six
or eight feet off the right-hand edge of the track coming into Turns 4 and 7.
The entire track has been recently repaved and is extremely smooth, except for
the straight from Turn 9 into Turn 10 which remains somewhat abrasive.
There are some irregularities at the drag strip's start line and burnout
areas, but the track is otherwise remarkably free of other bumps, frost
heaves, holes, and pavement flaws.
<p>
What follows is a generic description of the track, describing its features
without defining speeds, gears, or shift points -- all of which will vary
widely from car type to car type.
<p>
Most of the turns at Brainerd are sufficiently well separated by straight
segments that they may be treated as isolated turns.
Only Turns 7 and 8 must be considered as a set of clustered turns (where your
line through or out of a turn must be modified to accomodate the requirements of
the next turn or the one after it).
<p>
The false grid is immediately behind the grandstand at the east end of the
paddock, cars line up heading east for practice and qualifying sessions and west
for races.
No particularly tight turns are required to get from the false grid onto the
track, but part of the false grid has a slope and some cars may have difficulty
getting moving uphill from a dead stop.
<p>
The starter's stand is about halfway down the drag strip and is clearly
visible from the last turn.
The front straight is extremely wide and leads into the narrower but very
high-speed banked right-hand 60-degree Turn 1 which is intended be taken flat
out by all cars.
You can go through Turn 1 pretty much anywhere on the width of the track,
although you will scrub off less speed if you are alone and can take the
'classic' maximum-radius line through the corner.
Following Turn 1 is a straight long enough for you to regain most or all of
the speed you scrubbed off in Turn 1.
Turn 2 is a flat (but wider radius than Turn 1) very high-speed right-hand
80-degree sweeper that can be taken flat out by many cars.
The track is widened at the exit of Turn 2 but only for a short distance.
There is a long, generally flat but badly rutted, runoff area at the exit of 2,
with a robust tire wall just short of the trees.
Following Turn 2 is another straight, again long enough for you to regain much
of the speed you scrubbed off there.
<p>
Your car's top speed at Brainerd will be limited by aerodynamics and power,
rather than by torque and weight as at slower tracks.
You should be able to attain your top speed before entering Turn 1, and may be
able to reach it again coming into Turn 2 and possibly into Turn 3; maintaining
a high speed in this part of the course is crucial to good lap times.
Just be sure not to overstress your engine, you will be spending a
<i>lot</i> of time at max revs -- and turning hard right, so be sure your oil
pickup is properly located.
<p>
Turn 3 is slow only by comparison with the two previous turns, but many drivers
don't brake properly for it (after all, it's your first chance to use the
brakes for over a mile, and they will be well cooled).
Turn 3 is a 130-degree right-hand turn with a curb at the exit, with a
following short straight leading into the left-hand Turn 4.
Turns 4, 5, and 6 are a set of esses with progressively longer straight
stretches following them, and curbs at the exits of all three.
Turn 4 is about a 100-degree left-hand turn, slightly faster then Turn 3; Turns
5 and 6 are 90-degree right and left turns, respectively, both a little
slower than Turn 4.
The turns in the esses are far enough apart that you can easily get back across
the track each time, and you may even recover enough speed that you need to
change gears up and down between them (this more likely coming out of 5 and 6,
if you change up and back down between 4 and 5 you may be geared wrong).
<p>
Look for slghtly widened track surfaces at the entrance to all these turns,
these may help you -- but watch out for Turn 6, where using the widened
entry will likely cause you to apex too early.
<p>
Turn 7 is a higher-speed left-hand 45-degree turn that is followed very closely
by Turn 8, you must make a very late apex in Turn 7 and stay to the left edge
of the track at the exit to be set up properly for Turn 8.
The track surface is substantially widened at the entry to Turn 7, and again
at the entry to Turn 8.
Turn 8 is a 75-degree right-hand turn with a following short straight leading
into the fast 60-degree right-hand Turn 9, under the vehicle access bridge.
Taking too early an apex in Turn 9 can put you into the bridge abutment, and you
will be going fast enough here for that to be most undesirable.
<p>
The straight following Turn 9 runs past the drag-strip paddock area down into
Turn 10; sound measurements are made on the outside of the track part way down
this straight.
(Don't forget that Central Division tracks enforce a sound limit lower than
the SCCA requirement; at Brainerd it's 103 dBA.)
Turn 10 is a fast and very wide 120-degree right-hand turn leading out onto the
front straight; there is a little dip on the inside that gives the effect of a
slight banking, but it may be too early for practical use as an apex.
You can swing wide coming out of Turn 10 but check this out carefully, since
the track surface appears to fall off camber on the outside half of the
pavement (it feels as if it does but doesn't look like it).
Don't overdo the going wide; if you get too far to the left before stabilizing
the car in a straight-ahead attitude you may come unstuck going over the
burnout area of the drag strip and hit the end of the guard rail at driver's
left.
One you've straightened it out, though, it's just a matter of keeping your
foot down and your eye on the mirror until you come into Turn 3 again.
(Oh, and don't forget to shift up occasionally.)
Keep an eye out for merging traffic from the pit exit onto the track, beyond the
starter's stand coming into Turn 1.
<p>
If there is rain, the burnout and starting line areas are extremely slippery
whenever there is a lot of rubber down, and the painted area between the
lanes is also slippery but somewhat less so.
Some sort of surface treatment is often used on the complete length of the
drag strip before major drag races; when this treated pavement is first rained
upon (the front straight and first part of Turn 1), the surface becomes as
slippery as soaped glass -- rain tires and driving skill are no help.
<p>
The pit entrance is on the left at the beginning of the main straight (the
drag race burnout area); just before the starter's stand it bears left to
merge with the pit entrance road from the paddock.
At the pit exit you bear right for the track and left to a U-turn for the
paddock; Impound is at the scales along the road back into the paddock.

Camping is permitted at the track, for a modest fee (just remember that this
is the north woods, and north woods mosquitoes are reliably reported to have
been the original inspiration for the P-51 Mustang airplane).
If you are camping at the track, TV reception will be limited -- channel 22
in Brainerd is a PBS outlet (a repeater for the PBS station in Bemidji) and
channel 12 in Walker (40 miles north) is a CBS outlet (a repeater for the CBS
affiliate in Alexandria).
Other stations which may be usable depending on your antenna are channel 41,
an independent station in St. Cloud (50 miles south), and channel 42, an ABC
affiliate in Alexandria (60 miles southwest).
Stations in Duluth (95 miles east), Fargo (110 miles west), and Minneapolis
(110 miles southeast) will be at best only marginally viewable.
If you carry DBS equipment with you, much of the paddock has a clear view south.
<p>
There are motels close to the track; this list was updated in September 1996
from information in the AAA Tour Book, race entry forms, various motel chain
accomodation guides, regional Chamber of Commerce maps and accomodation guides,
local telephone directories, Internet resources, and personal observation.
Prices where shown are per night in a two-person two-bed room; an 'AAA'
indicates that discounts are offered to AAA members; a 'DR' indicates a dining
room on the premises or nearby; a 'CL' indicates a coin-operated laundry on
the premises or nearby; a 'P' indicates that small pets are permitted,
sometimes with a small extra charge ('$P'), and 'NP' indicates that pets are
not permitted; a 'WD indicates lower rates on weekdays (Monday through
Thursday nights); and a 'DEP' indicates that a reservation deposit is required.
<p>
Motels listed here are along or near Route 210 or 371.
Route 371 comes north into Brainerd (where it is known as 6th Street), joins
Route 210 and goes west for about two miles (Washington Street) into Baxter,
then turns north again to pass beside the track and into Nisswa.
There are shopping malls, auto parts stores, restaurants, fast-food chains,
gas stations, grocery stores, department stores, hardware stores, theatres,
and other shopping in Brainerd along Route 210 and along Route 371 north.
Nisswa is primarily a resort town; it is much smaller than Brainerd with
a narrower range of shopping, much of which is tourist-oriented.
