<u>The Halo</u></font><p>
The Halo consists of the oldest stars known, including about 146 
<a href="http://skye.as.arizona.edu/~chaboyer/mwgc.html">Globular Clusters</a>,
believed to have been formed during the early formation of the Galaxy with 
ages of 10-15 billion years from their <a href="./lect10.html#hr_gc">H-R 
Diagrams</a>.  The halo is also filled with a very diffuse, hot,
highly-ionized gas.  The very hot gas in the halo produces a 
<a href="http://universe.gsfc.nasa.gov/galleries/gamma_halo.html">gamma-ray 
halo</a>.
<p>
Neither the full extent nor the mass of the halo is well known.  
Investigations of the gaseous halos of other spiral galaxies show that the 
gas in the halo extends much further than previously thought, out to hundreds 
of thousands of light years.  Studies of the rotation of the Milky Way show 
that the halo dominates the mass of the galaxy, but the material is not 
visible, now called <a href="./lect16.html#dm">dark matter.</a>
<p>
<a name="sn"><font size=+1 color="burgundy">
<u>The Disk</u></font><p>
The disk of the Galaxy is a flattened, rotating system which contains the Sun 
and other intermediate-to-young stars.  The sun sits about 2/3 of the way from 
the center to the edge of the disk (about 25,000l.y. by the most modern 
estimates).   The sun revolves 
around the center of the galaxy about once every 250 million years.  The disk 
also the galaxy about contains atomic (HI) and molecular (H<sub>2</sub>) gas 
and dust.

 Since the Earth lies in the disk of the Milky Way, dust prevents us from 
determining the large scale structure of the Galaxy's spiral pattern 
beyond a few thousand light-years.
Radio observations have detailed the structure of the gas in 
the spiral arms, but it is still not known if our galaxy is a normal
spiral like our neighbor Andromeda, or a barred spiral like shown to the 
left.  The bulge of the galaxy is slightly elongated in the direction of the 
Sun, which may be due to a bar.</td></Table>

What lies at the <a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap960605.html"> 
center of our Galaxy</a>? Again, dust obscures the visible light 
from us and we must use radio and infrared observations to elicit the nuclear 
properties of the Galaxy.  A census shows us that the Galactic Center region
is an unusually crowded place, even in this visible-light

Map of Central region</a>. At radio wavelengths, where we can peer down to the 
very center, we see the complex strctures shown in the 
<a href="http://rsd-www.nrl.navy.mil/7213/lazio/GC/">1-meter wavelength radio
map</a> made by NRL astronomers which is shown below.  The map shows a region 
about 2000 light-years on a side; the center of the Milky Way coincides with
the source marked Sag A (or Sagittarius A), which is actually three sources,
a yound supernova remnant on the east side, an unusual ionized hydrogen region 
on the west side, and a very compact source called Sagittarius A* at the very 
center.

<p>
Although there is no lack of fascinating questions about the Galactic 
Center, recent interest has been focused on the question of the possibility 
that a massive black hole exists at the center of the central star cluster.
The presence of very high velocities in the stars and gas near the center of 
the galaxy has suggested to astronomers for a long time that a massive black 
hole might be present, providing a strong enough gravitational pull to keep 
the stars and gas in orbit.
<a href="./html/ghez.html">Andrea Ghez</a>, a professor at UCLA, used the Keck 
10-meter telescope at infrared wavelengths to measure
the velocities of 20 stars that lie close to the galactic center over a 
three-year period. She found the stars are orbiting at speeds up to 
1000 km/s (<i>3 million miles per hour</i>)! 
Observation done by scientists at the Max-Planck Institut in Germany have 
confirmed these results. This large gravitational 
acceleration requires an object with a mass 2.5 million times that of our Sun.
<P>
The stars are located near Sagittarius A<sup>*</sup>, the radio source
lying near the center of the galaxy. From its radio signal alone, Sgr
A<sup>*</sup> did not have to be particularly massive, since its
emission is not very powerful.  Using the VLBA (Very Long Baseline Array)
radio telescope, astronomers studied the motion of Sgr A<sup>*</sup>; they
found a velocity of less than 20 km/sec for Sgr A<sup>*</sup> itself. This
means it is very unlikely that Sgr A<sup>*</sup> is a single star or group
of stars.  Only a very massive object could remain stationary under the
conditions exisiting at the center of the galaxy.  The evidence is mounting
that Sag A<sup>*</sup> is indeed a black hole of 2-3 million times the mass
of the sun.  Astronomers speculate that the Black Hole is being "fed" by
gas from the molecular ring, or supernova remnant.  By consuming less than
about 1% of the mass of a star each year, releasing gravitational potential
energy, Sag A<sup>*</sup> can easily account for the high-energy phenomena
near the galactic center.
