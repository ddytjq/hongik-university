Can we fully understand change in human affairs from the perspectives of the
thematic disciplines? Philosophers (for millennia), anthropologists and
geographers (for little more than a century) have said "no," and have attempted
to view human phenomena as a totality. Anthropology at its best integrates human
biology, cultural anthropology or ethnology, psychological anthropology,
linguistics, and archaeology. But the task is daunting, and has led often to
elegant, but very specific case studies. However, new theoretical approaches to
adaptive systems and to modeling such approaches give hope that rigorous general
formulations are possible.
</P>
<P>
The Culture Group at SFI focuses primarily on long-term stability and
transformation in cultural developments. In December 1997, with the support of a
grant from the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research to organizers
Tim Kohler and George Gumerman, a diverse group of researchers gathered in Santa
Fe to assess the progress of this working group and to chart future directions.
Many fruitful exchanges ensued, ranging from general theoretical problems of
cultural change and its explanation to the specifics of modeling actual cultural
processes. Breakthroughs in modeling small-community networks in southwestern
North America provided a touchstone for the discussions.

The American Southwest provides a unique arena for developing and evaluating models of small-scale
societies. Over the last century, the peoples of living native communities in the Southwest have taught
anthropologists about many aspects of their lives in this beautiful, varied, and often dangerous land.
Archaeologists, geoarchaeologists, paleoethnobotanists, dendrochronologists, and many other scientists
have constructed the most precise chronological sequences and cultural understandings available for any
prehistoric culture anywhere. We know that between A.D. 200 and 1500, the ancestral Pueblo peoples took
up increasingly intensive horticulture and more effective long-term food storage techniques. The also
developed larger settlements and more elaborate ceremonial systems. However, they periodically faced
crises, abandoning large areas of the Southwest. Explicating growth, transformation, and crisis is a
challenge to both theorists and model-builders. The construction of "artificial societies"-discussed as a
general approach at the outset of the workshop by both Tim Kohler (Washington State U.) and Nigel Gilbert
(Surrey, UK)-is proving increasingly productive.

<IMG SRC="images/lions.gif" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE="6" VSPACE="0"><br clear="all">
A model in which the agents are households which can grow, fission, make adaptive choices about
production and storage, make choices to move (perhaps joining other households) and, in the worst
circumstances, fail, should generate the periodic aggregation into larger communities followed by
abandonment that archaeologists can document in Puebloan prehistory. The team of George Gumerman and
Jeff Dean (U. Arizona) working with Josh Epstein, Rob Axtell, and Miles Parker (Brookings Institute) and
Alan Swedland, an anthropological demographer (U. Mass. at Amherst), designed such a model, inspired by
the Brookings "Sugarscape" model. It represents households in the relatively small Long House Valley in
northeastern Arizona from AD 400 to 1400. The households respond to known annual rainfall and potential
garden productivity, documented by dendroclimatology and geomorphology, resulting in a sequence of
settlement trajectories recorded in maps, which are comparable to those produced by archaeological
survey.
</P>
<P>
The team of Tim Kohler and Carla Van West (Statistical Research Inc.) has been developing a model of
adaptive choices by households in southwestern Colorado from A.D. 900 to 1300. They have built a
Swarm-based model designed by Eric Carr and Jim Kresl with the help of Chris Langton which represents
household decision-making in a similar way, but in a large geographical space.
</P>
In the previous year's meeting of the Culture Group, earlier versions of both models had provided
impressive representations of growth phase, but had failed to show expected responses to environmental
changes. However, this year the group was excited to learn that changes in agricultural variables suggested
by several of last year's participants had produced responses to environmental change within the range of
the archaeologically documented responses. Both teams are now ready to elaborate their baseline models by
building in representations of such important processes as exchange, alliance building, and conflict.
<P>
The models developed for the Southwest and evaluated with the rich data of Puebloan life will be useful in
understanding similar developments in other areas of the world. For example, 40 years of detailed
anthropological research in highland New Guinea have built an even more detailed, albeit shorter, record
which can be modeled in the same terms used for Southwestern communities. Archaeologists and
dendrochronologists in the lake district of southern Germany, Switzerland, and adjacent France are building
as rich a record of village societies of the fourth and third millennia B.C. as that from the Southwest,
amenable to the same approaches. New work has just begun on the modeling of household decision-making in
the early Holocene environments of the first farming villages in the hills of the Levant during the ninth and
eight millennia B.C.-work which will borrow some of the approaches developed in the Southwest.

</FONT>

<P>
Even as new applications are stretching our extant understandings of small communities, some workshop
participants are working on both non-human primate foraging and pre-agricultural foraging groups. Renè te
Boekhorst (Zurich) in a paper with Charlotte Hemelrijk discussed primate societies, specifically the
theoretical issues of representing the nonlinear relations between group decisions about foraging for
resources and individual decisions about relations with other individuals. Brian Skyrms (Caltech) presented
the very different theoretical problem of generating simple systems of meaning and communication in the
adaptive contexts faced by non-human primate foragers, specifically how more complex language functions
might be generated from simpler calls.
</P>
<P>
In an impressive example of the modeling of forager strategies in such types of spaces as savanna, gallery
forest and mixed environments, Stephen Lansing (U. Michigan) presented a model by John Pepper, Barbara
Smuts and himself using a Swarm platform. This portrays foraging activities by primates and the
consequences of such foraging for within-group selection and between-group selection in foraging groups.
The model presently focuses on foraging plant foods, but scavenging and hunting, and issues of developing
communication systems as outlined by Skyrms could be added in future phases of development.
</P>
<P>
Those modeling specific foraging and food-processing behaviors among human foragers have several
decades of experience, and they have learned to adapt a variety of extant software to their purposes. Mark
Lake (Reading, UK) illustrated such an approach with his project on Mesolithic hunter-gatherers in early
Holocene Scotland.
</P>
<P>
One of the few efforts in this area of modeling to successfully evolve plant manipulation and domestication
from a context of simple foraging is the Oaxaca modeling project of Kent Flannery (U. Michigan) and Robert
Reynolds (Wayne State U.). Beginning with an overview of early Holocene foragers in central Oaxaca in
southern Mexico, Reynolds described the use of "cultural algorithms," representing cultural knowledge or
schemata, which could encode selected plant knowledge, presented in their book Gulia Naquitz. Under
specified adaptive circumstances, their model generates emergent patterns of plant manipulation leading
toward domestication, well beyond normal forager repertoires. Reynolds also touched briefly upon the new
work of Flannery and himself in modeling the growth of political hierarchies.

<P>
Other workshop participants are working on more complex cultural developments. In considering the
problems of evolving socio-political hierarchy, the workshop was fortunate to benefit from Jim Doran's
years of experience in the abstract modeling of hierarchy in simple "artificial societies." Doran (Essex,
UK) challenged the group to make explicit our tacit assumptions about "agents," "events," "knowledge,"
"rationality" and "cause." He urged the group to question the ultimate objectives of modeling, and to
consider using models to generate sets of trajectories or "world histories" and look at the properties of
these sets, rather than seek to replicate a single trajectory that happened to occur.
</P>
<P>
As the group's experience with simpler autonomous communities of foragers and farmers shows,
researchers are most likely to question assumptions about hierarchical societies, and to generate new
approaches, in the context of specific modeling efforts. Study of the marriage strategy of chiefs in the
Tongan archipelago by Cathy Small (Northern Arizona U.) is a challenging example. Using a C+ platform,
Small was able to represent actors in a structure of kin relations, to apply strategies of marriage, and to
generate emergent patterns of social status differences in Polynesian chiefdoms. While embedding this
model in a representation of a geographical space remains to be done, a way forward is certainly clear.
</P>
<P>
The final formal presentation was by Mark Lehner (Chicago, AERA Inc.), the Egyptologist most active in
new research on Egyptian civilization during the third millennium B.C. Giving us some sense of the richness
of extant knowledge of Old and Middle Kingdom lifeways, Lehner made a plea for complexity-based
perspectives, and warned of the dangers of moving too fast into the modeling of complex cultural
phenomena such as the Nile Valley in the Pyramid Age.

<P>
As in all successful workshops, some of the most promising advances were unplanned and unexpected. For
example, in talking to Andy Wuensche of the SFI community, Steve Lansing found a solution to long-standing
problems of how selection favors certain sets of behavioral rules, specifically rules for irrigation
management on the Indonesian island of Bali, studied in his book, Priests and Programmers. Some of
Wuensche's "random binary networks" behave like observed decision-making processes in Balinese
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The workshop ended with wide-ranging discussion of what the Culture Group should do to nurture the
promising initiatives generated during the event. While there is much interest in Swarm as a platform for
future efforts-particularly as it grows to incorporate new capacities to represent "cultural algorithms"
and other symbolic elements-there was also discussion of the value of continuing to model with a diversity
of platforms. Participants also generally agreed that a key challenge will be to learn to "grow" more
complex systems from the simpler ones which had been the focus in this workshop, but that this should not
be the exclusive focus of the Culture Group. Primatologists such as Smuts and te Boekhorst, linguists and
philosophers such as Skyrms, and cultural anthropologists such as Lansing and Small could make vital
contributions to the understanding of concepts, including "culture" itself, as well as to the specifics of both
simpler and more complex case studies. Finally, recognizing the complexity of the human career, the group
agreed that its members, and the Institute community as a whole, have an obligation to contribute to the
building of human responses to global change.
