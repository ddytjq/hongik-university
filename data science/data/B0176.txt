	        		<B>YOUR INTEREST RATES EXPLAINED</B><BR>
					<B>The interest rates shown in the box above only relate to the first four months of your account being opened.  For the next 8 months the rate is guaranteed to match the Bank of England base rate with the remaining 2 years being guaranteed to be only 1% below the Bank of England base rate.</B><BR><BR>
We have made our calculations assuming the prevailing Bank of England base rate of 4.00%, effective 8 November 2001.  Please see the second paragraph under the heading ‘Interest’ for a typical example of annual interest over the full three year period.  <B>Please note that this is only a typical example as the Bank of England base rate can fluctuate in the future.</B><BR><BR>
* Interest will be paid or credited after the deduction of income tax at the lower rate of 20% or, subject to the required certification, gross.<BR><BR>
** AER stands for Annual Equivalent Rate and illustrates what the interest rate would be if interest was paid and added each year.  The AER has been calculated using the gross rates you will receive in the first 12 months of your Bond and assumes the prevailing Bank of England base rate.<BR><BR>
Please remember that your rate of interest will be affected in the first 12 months of your Bond, if you choose to make a withdrawal. 


<BR><BR>
      			
	        		<B>YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED</B><BR>
					<B>Q</B>	How much can I invest?<BR>
<B>A</B>	Your investment can start from only £100 and you can add to your account at any time, up to the maximum of £500,000. To make life even easier, there is no limit on the individual amounts you can invest to build up your savings.<BR><BR>
<B>Q</B>	Do I have any access to my money in the first year?<BR>
<B>A</B>	Yes you do. In this period you can make one withdrawal of up to 50% of your balance. Should you do this, you would receive the no notice rate of interest on the amount withdrawn. This rate is currently the Bank of England base rate minus 1.00% – so you can certainly have access to your money if you need it unexpectedly. (Please refer to Access to Your Money – note 1).<BR><BR>
<B>Q</B>	When will I receive interest?<BR>
<B>A</B>	Your interest will be added to your Bond on the anniversary of the account being opened.<BR><BR>
<B>Q</B>	What happens at the end of the three year term?<BR>
<B>A</B>	We aim to contact you prior to your Bond maturing. <B>However, it is up to you to contact us with your instructions.</B>  Once your Bond matures, it will continue to give you no notice access to your money at the same rate as our Scarborough First Post Account.<BR><BR>
<B>Q</B>	Will there be any more Fixed Term Savings Bonds?<BR>
<B>A</B>	Further similar bonds may be available from time to time. The interest rates may be higher or lower than currently	available.  Please telephone Investments Direct on         		0845 458 4522 for details of products available at that time.<BR><BR>
<B>Q</B>	What do I have to do now?<BR>
<B>A</B>	All you need to do now is read the Opening Instructions, our General Investment and Telephone Access Conditions page, as well as the rest of this page, and then complete the application form for your Fixed Term Savings Bond.<BR><BR>
      			
	        		<B>OPENING INSTRUCTIONS</B><BR>
					The minimum investment required to open a Fixed Term Savings Bond is £100.<BR><BR>
The maximum amount which may be invested in a Fixed Term Savings Bond upon opening and during the life of the account is £500,000. This includes any interest which is credited to the account.<BR><BR>
The Society reserves the right to close your Fixed Term Savings Bond if the balance falls below £100.<BR><BR>
Your Fixed Term Savings Bond can only be operated through Investments Direct.<BR><BR>
We can only accept the initial payment into your Fixed Term Savings Bond in the form of a cheque, or transfer from an existing Society investment account. Bank/building society standing orders will be accepted for subsequent payments.<BR><BR>
This is a share account and on opening the account, the account holder(s) will become an investing member(s) of the Society, in accordance with its Rules.<BR><BR>
Accounts operated under Power of Attorney or as a Trustee account are not permitted.<BR><BR>
As your account is a Telephone Access                     account we can only accept joint                  accounts which are operated on                           either signature.<BR><BR>
As with all the Society’s accounts, 
you will enjoy a 14 day cooling off 
period. This gives you time to make 
sure that you are happy with your 
investment choice. Please see 
the Society’s General Investment 
Conditions for full details.
<BR><BR>
      			
	        		<B>PROOF OF IDENTITY</B><BR>
					The Government’s fight to stop financial crime is fully supported by the Society and as a consequence we do require proof of identity and verification of address  for all our customers. Two original documents, not more than three months old are required for each investor, photocopies are not acceptable. The documents, which will of course be returned to you, should be either:<BR><BR>
•	Utility bill (e.g. Gas/Electricity)<BR><BR>
•	Bank/Building Society Statement<BR><BR>
•	Current Council Tax/Notice of Tax Coding<BR><BR>
they MUST,  however,  show your name and address as it appears on your application form. Further verification checks may be carried out by the Society. If you already have an account with the Society bearing your current address, identification is not required. Unless proof of identity is provided, and all appropriate sections of the application form have been completed, including date of birth, we will have to  return your investment to you.
It is important that you read the following terms and conditions of this account. If you want to discuss the account with one of our Customer Advisors prior to making your decision, please call us on 0845 458 4522 9.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. Monday to Friday.
<BR><BR>
      			
	        		<B>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</B><BR>
					These Terms and Conditions (and those contained in the Scarborough Building Society General Investment Conditions and Telephone Access Conditions) together with the Scarborough Building Society Memorandum and Rules set out the contractual relationship between Scarborough Building Society (‘the Society’) and you the member.<BR><BR>
The Fixed Term Saving Bond will become a closed issue on 30 June 2002.  The Society may, however, close the account without notice prior to this date.<BR><BR>

Earlier in the information, we set out the “Opening Instructions”.  You should regard these paragraphs as being part of the Terms and Conditions.<BR><BR>
      			
	        		<B>INTEREST</B><BR>
					Your interest rate will be fixed for the first four months and thereafter will track the Bank of England base rate (also known as the repo rate). In months 5 to 12 the interest rate is guaranteed to match the Bank of England base rate and for the remainder of the term your interest rate will be just 1% below the Bank of England base rate.  Any new interest rate will become effective within 30 days of a Bank of England base rate change.<BR><BR>
You will receive 4.90% p.a. gross fixed for the first 4 months (AER 4.30%)(net 3.92% p.a).  For the subsequent 8 month period the interest rate will be 4.00% gross p.a. variable (net 3.20% p.a.) (AER 4.30%).  For the final 2 years the rate will be 3.00% gross p.a. variable (net 2.40% p.a.) (AER 3.00%). These calculations are based strictly on the assumption of the present Bank of England base rate of 4.00%.<BR><BR>
The interest rate is guaranteed not to fall below our variable base savings rate.<BR><BR>
Interest will be paid annually either to a designated bank or building society account, added to the balance of your Fixed Term Savings Bond, or transferred annually to another Scarborough Building Society account.  The Society reserves the right to change the date on which interest is credited to your account.<BR><BR>
Interest will be paid on the anniversary of the account being opened.<BR><BR>
If the balance of your Fixed Term Savings Bond falls below £100, the interest rate payable for the period that the balance remains below £100, will be the Society’s variable base savings rate applicable at the time.  Details are available on request.<BR><BR>
      			
	        		<B>ACCESS TO YOUR MONEY</B><BR>
					During the first 12 months of the account being opened, you may make one no notice withdrawal of up to 50% of the balance in your account at the time you make your withdrawal. The interest rate applied to the amount withdrawn will be 1% below the Bank of England base rate at the time of withdrawal. If the Bank of England base rate has changed but the Society has not yet effected the change to the interest rate applied to this account, then the previous Bank of England base rate will apply.<BR><BR> 
If you wish to take advantage of the withdrawal option, we will, in order to keep the interest adjustment to a minimum, withdraw from the most recent payments made into your account.<BR><BR>
You may close your account during the first 12 months subject to 150 days loss of interest at the gross rate applicable at the time of closure.<BR><BR> 
Following the initial 12 months, the account becomes a penalty free, no notice access account which means that you may make penalty free, no notice withdrawals, or close your account without penalty at any time during this period.<BR><BR>
Transfers to any other Society account are subject to the withdrawal/closure conditions described above.<BR><BR> 
Instructions to withdraw from, transfer or close your account must be made by telephone.<BR><BR>
This account does not offer cheque withdrawals. All withdrawals will be sent, via BACS, directly to your nominated bank account. Confirmation of withdrawals will be sent to the last address on record.  It normally takes 3 working days for a BACS transfer to become available at your bank.<BR><BR>

					You may make additional investments to your Fixed Term Savings Bond at any time.<BR><BR>
<B>MATURITY</B>
Your Fixed Term Savings Bond will mature 3 years after the account is opened, at which time we would aim to contact you. Once your account matures it will continue to give you penalty free, no notice access at the same rate as the Scarborough First Post Account.<BR><BR>
<B>SUBSEQUENT ISSUES</B>
If the issue of this Bond is no longer available when your application is received, your investment will automatically be credited to the issue that is being offered at that time (if available).  If no subsequent issue is available, we will try to contact you, or return your investment.<BR><BR>
When your Bond has been opened for you, we will write to you and confirm the issue into which your funds have been invested. If you do not wish to invest in the subsequent issue, you may of course take advantage of our 14 day cooling off period.<BR><BR>
<BR><BR>
      			
	        		<B>SUPERSEDED ACCOUNTS</B><BR>
					The Society follows the requirements of the Banking Code in relation to superseded accounts.<BR><BR>
If this account becomes “superseded” within the meaning of the Banking Code (e.g. because the Society no longer opens Fixed Term Savings Bonds or does not actively promote them) the Society may, for example, switch this account to an account with similar features from the current range at that time or, if there is no account with similar features,<BR><BR>
•	tell you that the account is superseded;<BR><BR>
•	tell you about our other accounts; and<BR><BR>
•	help you to switch to another account without any notice period and without any extra charges.<BR><BR>
If, in a case where there is no account with similar features, you do not tell the Society which other account you wish to switch to within 3 months of contacting you, the Society may switch you to the account it considers to be the highest paying no notice, easy access account from its current range. The Society will tell you if it does this.<BR><BR>
In any case where the Society switches a superseded account to another account from its current range, the Society will send you the terms and conditions, including details of interest rates, which apply to the new account. You agree that you will observe and adhere to these terms and conditions.<BR><BR>
<B>TELEPHONE ACCESS CONDITIONS</B><BR><BR>
As an added feature, this Account is only available to account holders who subscribe to the Telephone Access Conditions.<BR><BR>
In accordance with the Telephone Access Conditions, which have been issued to you seperately, operation (including all enquiries, administration and servicing) of the Fixed Term Savings Account must be arranged by telephoning Investments Direct. Investments Direct may currently be contacted on 0845 458 4522* between 9.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. Monday to Friday.
