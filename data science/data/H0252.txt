<p><font size="5"><strong>The Characterization of HIV-1 Specific
CD4+ T Helper Epitopes </strong></font></p>

<p>Lisa A. Cosimi and Eric S. Rosenberg </p>

<p>Massachussetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114,
lcosimi@partners.org </p>

<p><strong>Introduction </strong></p>

<p>There is increasing evidence that CD4+ T helper cells play a
critical role in the maintenance of virus-specific immunity in
most chronic viral infections (Matloubian, Battegay, van
Herrrath, Walter). Unfortunately, in the majority of HIV-1
infected individuals, these cellular responses are functionally
impaired in all stages of disease (Wahren, Berzofsky, Krowka,
Pontesilli, Schrier, Rosenberg). The most notable exception to
this &gt; observation is that the robust T helper cell responses
are observed in persons with long-term non-progressive infection
(Rosenberg). Furthermore, in studies of untreated chronic HIV-1
infection, virus-specific T helper cell responses are inversely
correlated with plasma HIV-1 viremia suggesting that these cells
provide an important role in viral control (Rosenberg, Kalams).
Recently, significant advances have been made in determining the
functional relevance of these CD4+ T helper cell responses. For
example, several reports from the SIV macaque model indicate that
virus-specific T helper cell responses are essential for viral
control when therapy is discontinued (Barouch, Hel, Lifson,
Lori). The functional relevance of HIV-1 specific T helper cell
responses has been further defined by human treatment
interruption studies (Lisziewicz, Rosenberg). Finally, vaccine
studies have shown that Th1 help is required for a successful
cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) response (Gahery-Segard, Mortara). </p>

<p>Despite mounting evidence that HIV-specific T helper cells
play a critical role in the immune response against HIV-1, little
is actually known about the precise epitopes targeted by these
cells. A successful immunotherapeutic strategy is likely to
require successful induction of HIV-1 specific antibody, CD8+ CTL
and CD4+ T helper responses. The identification of a repertoire
of dominant HIV-1 specific T helper epitopes that can bind to the
most common HLA alleles in the population will be critical to
this process (Bangham). The purpose of this review is to provide
an overview of those best-characterized human HIV-1 specific T
helper cell epitope regions that have been described to date in
natural infection. </p>

<p><strong>Characteristics of T helper epitopes </strong></p>

<p>CD4+ T cells are stimulated by peptides presented in
association with Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class~II.
The peptides are derived mainly from exogenous proteins that have
undergone proteolytic degradation and processing within the
endocytic pathway of antigen presenting cells (APCs) (reviewed in
Watts and Geuze). In brief, these antigens bind to APCs and are
internalized via intracellular vesicles in which they undergo
proteolytic degradation in preparation for loading onto MHC
class~II molecules. The alpha and beta chains of these molecules
are simultaneously synthesized and dimerized within the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with the C-terminal domains forming
the peptide-binding groove. These alpha-beta heterodimers then
associate with a membrane glycoprotein, termed the invariant
chain (Ii), whose lumenal domain, class~II-associated Ii peptide
(CLIP) functions to block the peptide-binding groove from any
class~I peptides within the ER (Roche). This complex is
transported to endosomes and delivered to the endocytic pathway
to associate with the peptides processed from exogenous antigen.
As opposed to class~I molecules, the class~II binding groove is
open and thereby able to accommodate longer peptides of 13--18
amino acids. The majority of identified class~II associated
peptides have been of this length, although a crystallization
model (Reinherz) suggests that a central core of as few as 9
amino acids actually come into contact with the T cell receptor.
Confirmation of this report is provided by recent published data
(Malhotra) and Norris et al . (personal communication) that
identify HIV-1 specific T helper epitopes of 9 amino acids in
length. Peptides that bind to class~II molecules lack conserved
anchor residues at the ends of the peptide. Rather, class~II
molecules and their associated peptide interact via hydrogen
bonding along the length of the central peptide (Madden). In
general, this sequence is composed of an aromatic or hydrophobic
residue at the amino terminus and three additional hydrophobic
residues in the central portion and at the carboxyl-terminus.
Elution of peptides from class~II molecules has shown that over
30 have a proline residue at position two and a cluster of
prolines at the carboxyl terminal end (Jardetsky). </p>

<p><strong>Methods for measuring T helper responses </strong></p>

<p>Historically, several in vitro assays have been used to detect
T helper responses in HIV-1 infection. To date, however, there
has been no agreed upon standard methodology for the utilization
of these assays or for the minimum responses required to be
considered significant. The measurement of cytokine secretion in
the supernatant of antigen stimulated cells was the method
predominantly used initially. Subsequently, the Lymphocyte
Proliferation Assay (LPA), measuring [3H] thymidine incorporation
in counts per minute (CPM) by antigen stimulated cells has been
more commonly used. Results are reported as either CPM, delta
counts per minute (DCPM: the CPM in the stimulated sample minus
the CPM in the negative control), or Stimulation Index (SI: the
mean CPM in the stimulated sample divided by the mean CPM in the
negative control). This assay is attractive because in vitro
proliferation is presumed to be correlated with in vivo function.
However, methodology with regards to incubation time,
concentration of stimulating antigen and cutoffs for minimum SI
or DCPM signifying a positive response have varied between
studies. </p>

<p>Most recently, newer assays have been utilized which measure
cytokine secretion with high sensitivity. The Elispot assay
measures cytokine secreted by a single cell though without CD8
depletion it is not immediately able to differentiate between T
helper and CTL responses. Further specificity is provided by
Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS) which quantifies, by flow
cytometric gating of CD4 cells, cytokine production by this cell
population. As opposed to all of the prior methods it has the
immediate advantage of being CD4+ specific. Despite the
potentially increased sensitivity of these assays for identifying
T helper responses, the correlation with functional capacity
remains to be elucidated. </p>

<p><strong>HIV-1 specific T helper epitopes </strong></p>

<p>Multiple laboratories have contributed to the identification
of HIV-1 specific T helper epitopes. Although few epitopes have
been fully characterized and fine mapped in natural infection,
there are multiple promising epitopic regions that have been
studied in murine, non-human primate and vaccine models in
non-HIV infected individuals. All of these are listed within the
LANL Molecular Immunology Database. </p>

<p>The following table includes the identified human epitope
regions that have been characterized in natural infection. It is
likely that these regions will be further specified to provide
HLA restricted epitopes that may be useful in future
immunotherapeutic strategies. In some cases we have included
examples where several groups have identified overlapping
regions. We anticipate that as these epitopes are further
characterized and the minimum or optimal sequences are identified
some of these regions may well include multiple epitopes while
others may be removed from the list. We have also made note of
the methods used to detect the responses and the variation in the
assay when applicable. In some cases we have omitted epitopes
where the exact sequence was not recorded though these may well
prove to be significant epitopes when further defined. </p>

<p>We anticipate that as CD4 epitopes are more specifically
delineated in the future more stringent criteria will be adopted
and the list will be adapted accordingly to include those
epitopes that are likely to be most useful in development of
immunotherapeutic strategies. For this list to be most useful,
included epitopes should ideally meet the following criteria: 1.
A T helper cell response detected in natural infection via LPA,
Elispot or ICS. Verification through CD8+ depletion, clonal
analysis or flow cytometry should be performed for all cases.
Ideally lymphoproliferation assay SI should be greater than 5
and/or DCPM&gt; 600. Further study into the correlation between
the various assays is still needed. 2. Truncation data with
demonstration of the minimal stimulatory epitope. 3. HLA
restriction. </p>
