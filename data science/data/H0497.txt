<center><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Quotes From Sewall Wright
and Others that Support Ewens' Claims</font></font></b></center>

<p>Ewens is not alone in his opinion that the substitution cost and other
genetic load arguments do not place the kind of limits on the substitution
rate that Haldane and Kimura imagined. In the chapter on genetic loads
in "<b>Evolution and the Genetics of Populations: Vol 3. Experimental results
and Evolutionary Deductions</b>" (published in 1977), Sewall Wright makes
several statements that agree substantially with Ewens, including his conclusion
that the load arguments are nonsense. Wright, along with Haldane and R.A.
Fisher is one of the founders of modern evolutionary theory.
<p>In the quotes that follow, I have made a few notes that are delineated
with square brackets.
<p>On page 480, Wright points out that there have been several attempts
at defining genetic loads:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>"Morton, Crow, and Muler (1956) proposed a definition of the
genetic load designed to include both of these types [segregation and heterotic
loads]. In a later paper (1970) Crow gives three definitions, the broadest
of which was as follows:"
<p>"The genetic load is the fraction in which the population mean differs
from a reference genotype. The trait measured is usually fitness or some
component thereof and the reference genotype is usually the maximum among
the actual or theoretically available types."</blockquote>

<p><br>[Wright continues]
<blockquote>"Thus he had in mind a family of parameters rather than one
narrowly defined one. Care must obviously be taken in applying the concept
to specify the precise sense in which it is being used."</blockquote>

<p><br>[On page 481, Wright concludes the section:]
<blockquote>"In general, the operation of selection is more complex than
in these simple cases.&nbsp; There seems to be no general biological meaning
of load as defined above other than the percentage difference of the mean
selective values of the population in question from that of&nbsp; some
<b>reference genotype</b>."</blockquote>

<p><br>[In the next section on Multiple Loci, Wright concludes:]
<blockquote>"These formulas [for the calculation of loads due to multiple
loci] must be used with caution since interactions with respect to selective
value are usually present. If many loci are involved and loads per locus
are not very small, <b>the genotype that combines the reference genotypes
of all loci is in general so rare theoretically that neither it nor anything
approaching it exists in a finite population</b>. In this case, L<sub>t</sub>
[total load summed over all loci] becomes practically meaningless, even
if there are no interaction effects."</blockquote>

<p><br>[Note that this conclusion exactly mirrors Ewens' more quantitative
arguments.]
<p>[Skipping to page 487:]
<blockquote>"As pointed out by Sved, Reed, and Bodmer (1967) and by Milkman
(1967), the load relative to the best genotype, where many loci are heterotic,
may give
<br>a grossly exaggerated impression on the strain on the reproductive
capacity.<b> This is because</b> <b>the best genotype is practically never
present, or at all closely approached, in a finite population.</b>"
<p>"Consider the case of equal selective disadvantage of both of two homozygotes,
s = t = 0.10, L = 0.05 at each locus. With 100 loci, selected independently,
L<sub>t</sub> [total load summed over all loci] = 1 = e<sup>-5</sup> =
0.9993, a load so close to 1 that it would seem to be inevitably fatal
to the species. With a gene frequency array (0.5A + 0.5A'), the distribution
of heterozygotes (Het) and homozygotes (Hom) would be (0.5Het + 0.5Hom)<sup>100</sup>
for 100 loci, with mean 50 Het, standard deviations 5 Het, and thus would
range from 35 to 65 heterozygous loci. <b>The genotype with heterozygosis
at all loci is so far outside this range that neither it nor anything approaching
it ever occurs in the population. It is absurd to suppose that all genotypes
produce as many offspring as would be produced by this 100-fold heterozygote,&nbsp;
if it existed, but that these are reduced to infinitesimal numbers by the
cumulative selective coefficients where there is homozygosis at 35 or more
loci. Thus the load relative to the 100-fold heterozygote is meaningless.
It would be more appropriate to take as a reference genotype one that is
above the average by only two or three standard deviations."</b></blockquote>

<p><br>[End of quotes from Sewall Wright]
<p>Notice that the final quotation from Wright is <b>exactly</b> the same
argument Ewens made against the substitution cost that Wright has applied
to the heterozygosity load.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Further validation that Ewens has solved Haldane's Dilemma is found
from Austin Burt in a 1997 review of Kimura's collected works (Quarterly
Review
<br>Biology 72, pg. 73). The quote is as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>"...Intermingled with these results is an insistence that most
nucleotide and amino acid substitutions observed within and between species
are selectively neutral - much the weakest part of the book. The original
argument (Chapter 48, 1968) is based on Haldane's cost of natural selection,
<b>and was soon shown to be nonsense by Ewens (1970. Theoretical Population
Biology 1:129-139)</b>.&nbsp; Subsequently, Kimura does not mention the
cost of selection (nor Ewens), but instead argues..."</blockquote>

<p><br>[End of quote from Burt]
<p>Note however that Burt has missed the fact that Ewens did in fact address
the cost of selection again (Ewens, 1993). At any rate, Ewens arguments
were
<br>so successful that Kimura never really countered them and subsequently
abandoned load theory as support for the neutral theory.
<p>A much more recent reference to Ewens' work is found in "The Mathematical
Theory of Selection, Recombination, and Mutation" , pg. 110 - 111 (Burger,
R. 2000 ):
<blockquote>"Closely related to the genetic load is another concept introduced
by Haldane (1957), namely <b>'the cost of natural selection' which is now
called the substitutional load</b>. Haldane considered an initially rare
but favorable gene, and compared <b>the amount of selective death, or cost</b>,
needed to carry out such a substitution. He defined the cost as the sum
of all expressions of the form (3.1), but with W<sub>max</sub> replaced
by the average fitness of the favorable allele, and the summation being
over all generations required for the substitution. The surprising result
is that this substitutional load is roughly independent of the selection
coefficient and depends only on the initial frequency of the favorable
mutant. The substitutional load has played a central role in the development
of the neutral theory of evolution (cf. Kimura 1983). A comprehensive treatment
of the theory of genetic loads may be found in Crow (1970, 1992). <b>For
well taken criticisms, in particular, concerning the substitutional load,
see Ewens (1979).</b>"
