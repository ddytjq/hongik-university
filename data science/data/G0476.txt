Globular clusters are gravitationally bound concentrations of approximately
ten thousand to one million stars, spread over a volume of several tens to 
about 200 light years in diameter. 
<p>
The first globular cluster discovered, but then taken for a nebula, was
<a href="m/m022.html">M22</a> in Sagittarius, which was probably discovered 
by <a href="xtra/Bios/ihle.html">Abraham Ihle</a> in 1665. This discovery was 
followed by that of southern 
<a href="xtra/ngc/n5139.html">Omega Centauri (NGC 5139)</a> by 
<a href="xtra/Bios/halley.html">Edmond Halley</a> on his 1677 journey to 
St. Helena. This "nebula" had been known but classified as star since ancient 
times. Next followed the discovery of <a href="m/m005.html">M5</a> in Serpens 
Caput by <a href="xtra/Bios/kirch.html">Gottfried Kirch</a> in 1702, and that 
of <a href="m/m013.html">M13</a> in Hercules, again by Halley, in 1714. 
<a href="xtra/Bios/decheseaux.html">De Ch&eacute;seaux</a>'s 
<a href="xtra/similar/deches.html">list of nebulae</a> of 1746 contains, in 
addition, two new globular clusters, 
<a href="m/m071.html">M71</a> and <a href="m/m004.html">M4</a>, while 
<a href="xtra/Bios/maraldi.html">Jean-Dominique Maraldi</a> discovered 
<a href="m/m015.html">M15</a> and <a href="m/m002.html">M2</a> in September of 
this year (1746).
<a href="xtra/Bios/lacaille.html">Abbe Lacaille</a>'s 
<a href="xtra/history/lacaille.html">catalog</a> of southern
"nebula" of 1751-52 contains 8 globular clusters (among them 5 new ones), while 
<a href="xtra/history/m-cat.html">Messier's catalog</a> contains a total of 29
globulars, 20 of them new discoveries. 
<a href="xtra/history/biograph.html">Charles Messier</a> was the first to 
resolve one globular cluster, <a href="m/m004.html">M4</a>, but still referred 
to the other 28 of these objects in his catalogue as "round nebulae." 
Thus, in summer 1782, before 
<a href="xtra/similar/herschel.html">William Herschel</a> started his 
comprehensive deep sky survey with large telescopes, there were 33 globular 
clusters known. Herschel himself discovered 37 new globulars, bringing the
number of known globulars to 70. He was the first to resolve virtually all of 
them into stars, and coined the term "globular cluster" in the discussion 
adjacent to his second catalog of 1000 deepsky objects (1789). 
<p>
These early known globulars are all belonging to our 
<a href="more/mw.html">Milky Way Galaxy</a>, with the exception (noted in 1994) 
of <a href="m/m054.html">M54</a>.
<p>
<a href="#melotte1915">Melotte's list of 1915</a> already lists 83 globulars, 
<a href="#shapley1930">Shapley (1930)</a> has 93, one of them in the 
Large Magellanic Cloud (NGC 1651). 
<a href="#sawyer1947">Helen Sawyer (Hogg, 1947)</a> lists 99 Milky Way globular 
clusters, 97 of which are still considered as such. Further lists of
<a href="#arp1965">Arp (1965)</a>, <a href="#alcaino1973">Alcaino (1973)</a> 
and <a href="#kukarkin1974">Kukarkin (1974)</a> have between 119 and 131 
clusters. 
<a href="#becvar">Becvar</a> lists 100, the 
<a href="#sc2000">Sky Catalogue 2000.0</a> lists 138 globulars, a number given 
for 1987 also by <a href="#kgj">Kenneth Glyn Jones (1991)</a>.
<a href="#harris">W.E. Harris' database of 1999</a> contains 147; 
the two further recent discoveries brings the number of currently known 
Milky Way globular clusters to 149.
Of the 149 known globular clusters of our 
<a href="more/mw.html">Milky Way galaxy</a>, 104 are in the NGC catalogue, and
3 more in the IC catalogue of J.L.E. Dreyer.
<p>
Since their discovery and resolution, globular clusters were always 
<i>thought</i> or suspected to be physical objects, agglomerations or swarms of 
stars held together by their mutual gravity, all close together and at about the 
same distance. 
The proof for this correct guess, or working model, came only with spectroscopy, 
showing that the stars of these clusters have radial velocities as expected for 
such swarms, and perfectly match in color-magnitude or Hertzsprung-Russell 
diagram, i.e. they represent a population of stars of about same age (also see
below), all at about the same distance.
<p>
The distribution of the globular clusters in our 
<a href="more/mw.html">Milky Way galaxy</a> is concentrated around the 
galactic center in the Sagittarius -- Scorpius -- Ophiuchus region: Of the 
138 Milky Way globulars listed in the Sky Catalog 2000, these constellations 
contain 29, 18, and 24 globulars, respectively, so a total of 71 clusters, or 
51.4 percent (though one must admit that of the 29 clusters listed in 
Sagittarius, probably four are members of the 
<a href="more/sagdeg.html">Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy</a> discovered 
1994, and not really of the Milky Way, among them 
<a href="m/m054.html">M54</a>). 
Current counting (June 2002) brings these numbers to 33, 19 and 25 globulars in 
Sagittarius, Scorpius and Ophiuchus, respectively, thus a total of 77 clusters 
of a total of 149, or 51.7 percent. 
Of the 88 constellations, only 43 or about half contain any globular cluster 
at all; Aquila follows with 6, Serpens with 5 and Hercules with 4 clusters,
and no further constellation contains more than 3.
<p>
Of the 149 known clusters, 136 (91.3 percent) are concentrated in the 
hemisphere centered on Sagittarius, while only 13 globulars (8.7 percent) are 
on the opposite side of us (among them <a href="m/m079.html">M79</a>). 
This pronounced anisotropy in the distribution of globular clusters was of 
historic importance when <i>Harlow Shapley</i>, in 1917, derived from it that 
the center of our galaxy is lying at a considerable distance in the direction 
of Sagittarius and not close to our solar system as had been thought
previously (however, he significantly overestimated the size of the Milky Way
as a whole, as well as the size of the globular cluster system and our
distance from the galactic center).
<p>
Radial velocity measurements have revealed that most globulars are moving
in highly excentric elliptical orbits that take them far outside the Milky
Way; they form a halo of roughly spherical shape which is highly concentrated
to the Galactic Center, but reaches out to a distance of several 100,000 light 
years, much more than the dimension of the Galaxy's disk. 
As they don't participate in the Galaxy's disk rotation, they can have high
relative velocities of several 100 km/sec with respect to our solar system;
this is what shows up in the radial velocity measurements.
<p>
Spectroscopic study of globular clusters shows that they are much lower in 
heavy element abundance than stars such as the Sun that form in the disks of 
galaxies. Thus, globular clusters are believed to be very old and consisted 
from an earlier generation of stars (<i>Population II</i>), which have formed 
from the more primordial matter present in the young galaxy just after 
(or even before) its formation.
The disk stars, by contrast, have evolved through many cycles of starbirth 
and supernovae, which enrich the heavy element concentration in 
star-forming clouds and may also trigger their collapse.
<p>
Globular clusters typically contain a number of variable stars, in particular
RR Lyrae stars which were once called "cluster variables" because of their
abundance in globulars. Their frequency is varying from cluster to cluster.
A small number of four globular clusters also contains 
<a href="xtra/supp/gc_pn.html">planetary nebulae</a>; these appear to be so 
rare because of the short liftime of 
<a href="planetar.html">planetary nebulae</a>. 
They also contain a large number of white dwarfs and, at least in some cases,
many neutron stars, some of which show up as pulsars.
<br clear=all>
<p>
<a href="xtra/leos/M5f4.html">
<img src="Pics/Leos/M5f4tiny.jpg" alt="[M5 CMD]" align=right border=0></a>
The H-R diagrams for globular clusters (here shown for 
<a href="m/m005.html">M5</a>) typically have short main sequences 
and prominent horizontal branches, this again represents very old stars 
that have evolved past giant or supergiant phases. 
<p>
Comparison of the measured HRD of each globular cluster with theoretical
model HRDs derived from the theory of stellar evolution provides the 
possibility to derive, or estimate, the age of that particular cluster.
It is perhaps a bit surprising that all the globular clusters seem to be of 
about the same age; there seems to be a physical reason that they all formed
in a short period of time in the history of the universe, and this period 
was apparently long ago when the galaxies were young.
Semi-recent estimates yield an age of 12 to 20 billion years; the best value 
for observation is perhaps 12 to 16 billion (see e.g. the discussion at
<a href="m/m092.html">M92</a>).
As their age is crucial as a lower limit for the age of our universe, it was
subject to vivid and continuous discussion since decades.
In early 1997, the discussion of the age of the globular clusters got revived
because of the general modifications of the distance scale of the universe, 
implied by results of ESA's astrometrical satellite Hipparcos: These results 
suggest that galaxies and many galactic objects, including the globular 
clusters, may be at a 10 per cent larger distance; 
therefore, the intrinsical brightness of all their stars must be about 20 % 
higher.  Considering the various relations which are important for
understanding stellar structure and evolution, they should also be roughly
15 % younger, in a preliminary off-hand estimate. 
<p>
As globular clusters follow their orbits around the Milky Way's Galactic
center through the billion years, they are subject to a variety of
disturbations:
<ul>
<li>some of their stars escape as they get randomly accelerated in mutual 
  encounters, 
<li>tidal forces from the parent galaxy acts on them, particularly heavy in 
  that part of their orbit which is closest to the galactic center 
  (near the periapsis),
<li>each passing through the galactic plane, as well as close encounters with
  greater masses like (any type of) clusters or big nebulous clouds
  contributes to disturbation,
<li>stellar evolutionary effects and loss of gas also contribute to increasing 
  the rate of mass loss (and thus deflation) of the clusters
</ul>
Although significantly slower compared to the less densely packed and less 
populated <a href="open.html">open clusters</a>, these disturbations are 
tending to disrupt the clusters.
The currently existing globulars are just the survivers of a perhaps 
significantly larger population, the rest of which has been disrupted and 
spread their stars throughout the Galactic halo.  The process of destruction 
still works, and it was estimated that about half of the Milky Way globulars 
will cease to exist within the next 10 billion years.
<p>
Our galaxy has a system of perhaps about 180 to 200 globular clusters 
(including 28 of the 29 Messier globulars, all but above mentioned
<a href="m/m054.html">M54</a>).
Most other galaxies have globular cluster systems as well, in some cases 
(e.g., for <a href="m/m087.html">M87</a>) 
containing several thousands of globulars!
A small number of the known extragalacric globulars is in the reach of larger
amateur telescopes; see Jim Shield's 
<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/id/jsredshift/gcextra.htm">
Extragalactic Globulars</a> webpage for examples.
<p>
While all the globulars in our Milky Way, and our big companion, the 
<a href="m/m031.html">Andromeda Galaxy M31</a>, are old, other 
<a href="more/local.html">Local Group</a> galaxies as the 
<a href="xtra/ngc/lmc.html">Large</a> and the 
<a href="xtra/ngc/smc.html">Small Magellanic Cloud</a> as well as the
<a href="m/m033.html">Triangulum Galaxy M33</a> also contain considerably
younger globular star clusters, which can be concluded with certainty from
spectroscopic investigations.
These galaxies contain also extremely large diffuse nebulae with masses of
the order of globular clusters, clear candidates for future young globulars
currently in formation, notably the
<a href="xtra/ngc/n2070.html">Tarantula Nebula NGC 2070</a> in the LMC and
<a href="more/m033_n604.html">NGC 604</a> in M33.
A large number of over 100 young globular clusters have been detected 
recently in <a href="m/m082.html">M82</a>, an irregular galaxy beyond the 
Local Group.
