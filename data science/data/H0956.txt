<P><IMG SRC="/pictures/letters/T.gif" ALT="T" ALIGN=LEFT>his document
discusses the way radiometric dating and stratigraphic principles are
used to establish the conventional geological time scale. It is not
about the theory behind radiometric dating methods, it is about their
<I>application</I>, and it therefore assumes the reader has some
familiarity with the technique already (refer to <A
HREF="#other">"Other Sources"</A> for more information).&nbsp; As an
example of how they are used, radiometric dates from geologically
simple, fossiliferous Cretaceous rocks in western North America are
compared to the geological time scale. To get to that point, there is
also a historical discussion and description of non-radiometric dating
methods.

<P>The example used here contrasts sharply with the way conventional scientific
dating methods are characterized by some critics (for example, refer to
discussion in "<A HREF="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-age-of-earth.html#creacrit">Common
Creationist Criticisms of Mainstream Dating Methods</A>" in the <A HREF="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-age-of-earth.html">Age
of the Earth FAQ</A> and <A HREF="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/isochron-dating.html">Isochron
Dating FAQ</A>).&nbsp; A common form of criticism is to cite geologically
complicated situations where the application of radiometric dating is very
challenging.&nbsp; These are often characterised as the norm, rather than
the exception.&nbsp; I thought it would be useful to present an example
where the geology is simple, and unsurprisingly, the method does work well,
to show the quality of data that would have to be invalidated before a
major revision of the geologic time scale could be accepted by conventional
scientists.&nbsp; Geochronologists do not claim that radiometric dating
is foolproof (no scientific method is), but it does work reliably for most
samples.&nbsp; It is these highly consistent and reliable samples, rather
than the tricky ones, that have to be falsified for "young Earth" theories
to have any scientific plausibility, not to mention the need to falsify
huge amounts of evidence from other techniques.

<P>This document is partly based on a prior posting composed in reply to
<A HREF="http://access1.digex.net/~medved/">Ted Holden</A>. My thanks to
both him and other critics for motivating me.

<P><A NAME="back"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Background</FONT></B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><A NAME="princ"></A><B>Stratigraphic Principles and Relative Time</B>

<P>Much of the Earth's geology consists of successional layers of
different rock types, piled one on top of another. The most common
rocks observed in this form are sedimentary rocks (derived from what
were formerly sediments), and extrusive igneous rocks (e.g., lavas,
volcanic ash, and other formerly molten rocks extruded onto the
Earth's surface). The layers of rock are known as "strata", and the
study of their succession is known as "stratigraphy".  Fundamental to
stratigraphy are a set of simple principles, based on elementary
geometry, empirical observation of the way these rocks are deposited
today, and gravity. Most of these principles were formally proposed
by&nbsp; Nicolaus Steno (Niels Steensen, Danish), in 1669, although
some have an even older heritage that extends as far back as the
authors of the Bible. A few principles were recognized and specified
later. An early summary of them is found in Charles Lyell's
"Principles of Geology", published in 1830-32, and does not differ
greatly from a modern formulation: <OL><A NAME="princ1"></A>
<LI>
The principle of superposition - in a vertical sequence of sedimentary
or volcanic rocks, a higher rock unit is younger than a lower one. "Down"
is older, "up" is younger.&nbsp;<A NAME="princ2"></A></LI>

<LI>
The principle of original horizontality - rock layers were originally deposited
close to horizontal.&nbsp;<A NAME="princ3"></A></LI>

<LI>
The principle of original lateral extension - A rock unit continues laterally
unless there is a structure or change to prevent its extension.&nbsp;<A NAME="princ4"></A></LI>

<LI>
The principle of cross-cutting relationships - a structure that cuts another
is younger than the structure that is cut.&nbsp;<A NAME="princ5"></A></LI>

<LI>
The principle of inclusion - a structure that is included in another is
older than the including structure.&nbsp;<A NAME="princ6"></A></LI>

<LI>
The principle of "uniformitarianism" - processes operating in the past
were constrained by the same "laws of physics" as operate today.</LI>
</OL>
Note that these are <I>principles</I>. In no way are they meant to imply
there are no exceptions. For example, the principle of superposition is
based, fundamentally, on gravity. In order for a layer of material to be
deposited, something has to be beneath it to support it. It can't float
in mid-air, particularly if the material involved is sand, mud, or molten
rock. The principle of superposition therefore has a clear implication
for the <I>relative</I> age of a vertical succession of strata. There are
situations where it potentially fails -- for example, in cave deposits.
In this situation, the cave contents are younger than both the bedrock
below the cave and the suspended roof above. However, note that because
of the "<A HREF="#princ4">principle of cross-cutting relationships"</A>,
careful examination of the contact between the cave infill and the surrounding
rock will reveal the true relative age relationships, as will the <A HREF="#princ5">"principle
of inclusion"</A> if fragments of the surrounding rock are found within
the infill. Cave deposits also often have distinctive structures of their
own (e.g., spelothems like stalactites and stalagmites), so it is not likely
that someone could mistake them for a successional sequence of rock units.

<P>These geological principles are not <I>assumptions</I> either. Each
of them is a testable hypothesis about the relationships between rock units
and their characteristics. They are applied by geologists in the same sense
that a "null hypothesis" is in statistics -- not necessarily correct, just
testable. In the last 200 or more years of their application, they are
<I>often</I> valid, but geologists do not assume they are. They are the
"initial working hypotheses" to be tested further by data.

<P>Using these principles, it is possible to construct an interpretation
of the sequence of events for any geological situation, even on other planets
(e.g., a crater impact can cut into an older, pre-existing surface, or
craters may overlap, revealing their relative ages). The simplest situation
for a geologist is a "layer cake" succession of sedimentary or extrusive
igneous rock units arranged in nearly horizontal layers. In such a situation,
the "<A HREF="#princ1">principle of superposition"</A> is easily applied,
and the strata towards the bottom are older, those towards the top are
younger.

stratigraphic section, and a "way up" indicator example: wave ripples.&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>


<P>This orientation is not an assumption, because in virtually all situations,
it is also possible to&nbsp; determine the original "way up" in the stratigraphic
succession from "way up indicators". For example, wave ripples have their
pointed crests on the "up" side, and more rounded troughs on the "down"
side. Many other indicators are commonly present, including ones that can
even tell you the angle of the depositional surface at the time ("geopetal
structures"), "assuming" that gravity was "down" at the time, which isn't
much of an assumption :-).

<P>In more complicated situations, like in a mountain belt, there are often
faults, folds, and other structural complications that have deformed and
"chopped up" the original stratigraphy. Despite this, the <A HREF="#princ4">"principle
of cross cutting relationships"</A> can be used to determine the sequence
of deposition, folds, and faults based on their intersections -- if folds
and faults deform or cut across the sedimentary layers and surfaces, then
they obviously came after deposition of the sediments.&nbsp; You can't
deform a structure (e.g., bedding) that is not there yet!&nbsp; Even in
complex situations of multiple deposition, deformation, erosion, deposition,
and repeated events, it is possible to reconstruct the sequence of events.
Even if the folding is so intense that some of the strata is now upside
down, this fact can be recognized with "way up" indicators.

<P>No matter what the geologic situation, these basic principles reliably
yield a reconstructed history of the sequence of events, both depositional,
erosional, deformational, and others, for the geology of a region. This
reconstruction is tested and refined as new field information is collected,
and can be (and often is) done completely independently of anything to
do with other methods (e.g., fossils and radiometric dating). The reconstructed
history of events forms a "relative time scale", because it is possible
to tell that event A occurred prior to event B, which occurred prior to
event C, regardless of the actual duration of time between them. Sometimes
this study is referred to as "event stratigraphy", a term that applies
regardless of the type of event that occurs (biologic, sedimentologic,
environmental, volcanic, magnetic, diagenetic, tectonic, etc.).

<P>These simple techniques have widely and successfully applied since at
least the early 1700s, and by the early 1800s, geologists had recognized
that many obvious similarities existed in terms of the independently-reconstructed
sequence of geologic events observed in different parts of the world. One
of the earliest (1759) relative time scales based upon this observation
was the subdivision of the Earth's stratigraphy (and therefore its history),
into the "Primary", "Secondary", "Tertiary", and later (1854) "Quaternary"
strata based mainly on characteristic rock types in Europe. The latter
two subdivisions, in an emended form, are still used today by geologists.&nbsp;
The earliest, "Primary" is somewhat similar to the modern Paleozoic and
Precambrian, and the "Secondary" is similar to the modern Mesozoic.&nbsp;
Another observation was the similarity of the fossils observed within the
succession of strata, which leads to the next topic.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><A NAME="biostrat"></A><B>Biostratigraphy</B>

<P>As geologists continued to reconstruct the Earth's geologic history
in the 1700s and early 1800s, they quickly recognized that the distribution
of fossils within this history was not random -- fossils occurred in a
consistent order. This was true at a regional, and even a global scale.
Furthermore, fossil organisms were more unique than rock types, and much
more varied, offering the potential for a much more precise subdivision
of the stratigraphy and events within it.

<P>The recognition of the utility of fossils for more precise "relative
dating" is often attributed to William Smith, a canal engineer who observed
the fossil succession while digging through the rocks of southern England.
But scientists like Albert Oppel hit upon the same principles at about
about the same time or earlier.&nbsp; In Smith's case, by using empirical
observations of the fossil succession, he was able to propose a fine subdivision
of the rocks and map out the formations of southern England in one of the
earliest geological maps (1815). Other workers in the rest of Europe, and
eventually the rest of the world, were able to compare directly to the
same fossil succession in their areas, even when the rock types themselves
varied at finer scale. For example, everywhere in the world, trilobites
were found lower in the stratigraphy than marine reptiles. Dinosaurs were
found after the first occurrence of land plants, insects, and amphibians.
Spore-bearing land plants like ferns were always found before the occurrence
of flowering plants.&nbsp; And so on.

<P>The observation that fossils occur in a consistent succession is known
as the "principle of faunal (and floral) succession". The study of the
succession of fossils and its application to relative dating is known as
"biostratigraphy". Each increment of time in the stratigraphy could be
characterized by a particular assemblage of fossil organisms, formally
termed a biostratigraphic "zone" by the German paleontologists Friedrich
Quenstedt and Albert Oppel. These zones could then be traced over large
regions, and eventually globally. Groups of zones were used to establish
larger intervals of stratigraphy, known as geologic "stages" and geologic
"systems". The time corresponding to most of these intervals of rock became
known as geologic "ages" and "periods", respectively.&nbsp; By the end
of the 1830s, most of the presently-used geologic periods had been established
based on their fossil content and their observed relative position in the
stratigraphy (e.g., Cambrian (1835), Ordovician (1879), Silurian (1835),
Devonian (1839), Carboniferous (1822), Permian (1841), Triassic (1834),
Jurassic (1829), Cretaceous (1823), Tertiary (1759), and Pleistocene (1839)).
These terms were preceded by decades by other terms for various geologic
subdivisions, and although there was subsequent debate over their exact
boundaries (e.g., between the Cambrian and Silurian Periods, which was
resolved by proposal of the Ordovician Period between them), the historical
descriptions and fossil succession would be easily recognizable today.

<P>By the 1830s, fossil succession had been studied to an increasing degree,
such that the broad history of life on Earth was well understood, regardless
of the debate over the names applied to portions of it, and where exactly
to make the divisions. All paleontologists recognized unmistakable trends
in morphology through time in the succession of fossil organisms. This
observation led to attempts to explain the fossil succession by various
mechanisms. Perhaps the best known example is Darwin's theory of evolution
by natural selection. Note that chronologically, fossil succession was
well and independently established long before Darwin's evolutionary theory
was proposed in 1859. Fossil succession and the geologic time scale are
constrained by the observed order of the stratigraphy -- basically geometry
-- <I>not</I> by evolutionary theory.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><A NAME="radiomet"></A><B>Radiometric Dating: Calibrating the Relative
Time Scale</B>

<P>For almost the next 100 years, geologists operated using relative
dating methods, both using the basic principles of geology and fossil
succession (biostratigraphy). Various attempts were made as far back
as the 1700s to scientifically estimate the age of the Earth, and,
later, to use this to calibrate the relative time scale to numeric
values (refer to <A
HREF="http://www.tiac.net/users/cri/geohist.html">"Changing views of
the history of the Earth"</A> by Richard Harter and Chris Stassen).
Most of the early attempts were based on rates of deposition, erosion,
and other geological processes, which yielded uncertain time
estimates, but which clearly indicated Earth history was at least 100
million or more years old. A challenge to this interpretation came in
the form of Lord Kelvin's (William Thomson's) calculations of the heat
flow from the Earth, and the implication this had for the age --
rather than hundreds of millions of years, the Earth could be as young
as tens of million of years old.  This evaluation was subsequently
invalidated by the discovery of radioactivity in the last years of the
19th century, which was an unaccounted for source of heat in Kelvin's
original calculations. With it factored in, the Earth could be vastly
older. Estimates of the age of the Earth again returned to the prior
methods.

<P>The discovery of radioactivity also had another side effect, although
it was several more decades before its additional significance to geology
became apparent and the techniques became refined. Because of the chemistry
of rocks, it was possible to calculate how much radioactive decay had occurred
since an appropriate mineral had formed, and how much time had therefore
expired, by looking at the ratio between the original radioactive isotope
and its product, if the decay rate was known. Many geological complications
and measurement difficulties existed, but initial attempts at the method
clearly demonstrated that the Earth was very old. In fact, the numbers
that became available were significantly older than even some geologists
were expecting -- rather than hundreds of millions of years, which was
the minimum age expected, the Earth's history was clearly at least billions
of years long.

<P>Radiometric dating provides numerical values for the age of an appropriate
rock, usually expressed in millions of years. Therefore, by dating a series
of rocks in a vertical succession of strata previously recognized with
basic geologic principles (see <A HREF="#princ">Stratigraphic principles
and relative time</A>), it can provide a numerical calibration for what
would otherwise be only an ordering of events -- i.e. relative dating obtained
from biostratigraphy (fossils), superpositional relationships, or other
techniques. The integration of relative dating and radiometric dating has
resulted in a series of increasingly precise "absolute" (i.e. numeric)
geologic time scales, starting from about the 1910s to 1930s (simple radioisotope
estimates) and becoming more precise as the modern radiometric dating methods
were employed (starting in about the 1950s).<SUP><A HREF="#note1">1</A></SUP>

<P>&nbsp;
<BR><A NAME="theoret"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A Theoretical Example</FONT></B>

<P>To show how relative dating and numeric/absolute dating methods are
integrated, it is useful to examine a theoretical example first.&nbsp;
Given the background above, the information used for a geologic time scale
can be related like this:
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="560" >

</TR>

<TR>
<TD><B>Figure 2.</B> How relative dating of events and radiometric (numeric)
dates are combined to produce a calibrated geological time scale. In this
example, the data demonstrates that "fossil B time" was somewhere between
151 and 140 million years ago, and that "fossil A time" is older than 151
million years ago. Note that because of the position of the dated beds,
there is room for improvement in the time constraints on these fossil-bearing
intervals (e.g., you could look for a datable volcanic ash at 40-45m to
better constrain the time of first appearance of fossil B).&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>


<P>A continuous vertical stratigraphic section will provide the order of
occurrence of events (column 1 of <A HREF="#fig2">Figure 2</A>). These
are summarized in terms of a "relative time scale" (column 2 of <A HREF="#fig2">Figure
2</A>). Geologists can refer to intervals of time as being "pre-first appearance
of species A" or "during the existence of species A", or "after volcanic
eruption #1" (at least six subdivisions are possible in the example in
<A HREF="#fig2">Figure 2</A>). For this type of "relative dating" to work
it must be known that the succession of events is unique (or at least that
duplicate events are recognized -- e.g., the "first ash bed" and "second
ash bed") and roughly synchronous over the area of interest. Unique events
can be biological (e.g., the first appearance of a particular species of
organisms) or non-biological (e.g., the deposition of a volcanic ash with
a unique chemistry and mineralogy over a wide area), and they will have
varying degrees of lateral extent. Ideally, geologists are looking for
events that are unmistakably unique, in a consistent order, and of global
extent in order to construct a geological time scale with <I>global</I>
significance. Some of these events do exist.&nbsp; For example, the boundary
between the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods is recognized on the basis
of the extinction of a large number of organisms globally (including ammonites,
dinosaurs, and others), the first appearance of new types of organisms,
the presence of geochemical anomalies (notably iridium), and unusual types
of minerals related to meteorite impact processes (impact spherules and
shocked quartz).&nbsp; These types of distinctive events provide confirmation
that the Earth's stratigraphy is genuinely successional on a global scale.
Even without that knowledge, it is still possible to construct local geologic
time scales.

<P>Although the idea that unique physical and biotic events are synchronous
might sound like an "assumption", it is not. It can, and has been, tested
in innumerable ways since the 19th century, in some cases by physically
tracing distinct units laterally for hundreds or thousands of kilometres
and looking very carefully to see if the order of events changes. Geologists
do sometimes find events that are "diachronous" (i.e. not the same age
everywhere), but despite this deserved caution, after extensive testing,
it is obvious that many events really are synchronous to the limits of
resolution offered by the geological record.

<P>Because any newly-studied locality will have independent fossil, superpositional,
or radiometric data that have not yet been incorporated into the global
geological time scale, all data types serve as both an independent test
of each other (on a local scale), and of the global geological time scale
itself. The test is more than just a "right" or "wrong" assessment, because
there is a certain level of uncertainty in all age determinations. For
example, an inconsistency may indicate that a particular geological boundary
occurred 76 million years ago, rather than 75 million years ago, which
might be cause for revising the age estimate, but does not make the original
estimate flagrantly "wrong". It depends upon the exact situation, and how
much data are present to test hypotheses (e.g., could the range of a fossil
be a bit different from what was thought previously, or could the boundary
between two time periods be a slightly different numerical age?). Whatever
the situation, the current global geological time scale makes <I>predictions</I>
about relationships between relative and absolute age-dating at a local
scale, and the input of new data means the global geologic time scale is
continually refined and is known with increasing precision. This trend
can be seen by looking at the history of proposed geologic time scales
(described in the first chapter of <A HREF="#ref6">[Harland et al, 1982,
p.4-5]</A>, and see below).
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><A NAME="Circularity"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Circularity?</FONT></B>

<P>The unfortunate part of the natural process of refinement of time scales
is the <I>appearance</I> of circularity if people do not look at the source
of the data carefully enough.&nbsp; Most commonly, this is characterised
by oversimplified statements like:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fossils date the rock, and the rock dates the
fossils."

<P>Even some geologists have stated this misconception (in slightly different
words) in seemingly authoritative works (e.g., <A HREF="#Rastall56">Rastall,
1956</A>), so it is persistent, even if it is categorically wrong (refer
to <A HREF="#Harper80">Harper (1980)</A>, p.246-247 for a thorough debunking,
although it is a rather technical explanation).

<P>When a geologist collects a rock sample for radiometric age dating,
or collects a fossil, there are independent constraints on the relative
and numerical age of the resulting data.&nbsp; Stratigraphic position is
an obvious one, but there are many others.&nbsp; There is no way for a
geologist to choose what numerical value a radiometric date will yield,
or what position a fossil will be found at in a stratigraphic section.&nbsp;
<I>Every</I> piece of data collected like this is an independent check
of what has been previously studied. The data are determined by the <I>rocks</I>,
not by preconceived notions about what will be found. Every time a rock
is picked up it is a test of the predictions made by the current understanding
of the geological time scale. The time scale <I>is</I> refined to reflect
the relatively few and progressively smaller inconsistencies that are found.
This is <I>not</I> circularity, it is the normal scientific process of
refining one's understanding with new data. It happens in all sciences.

<P>If an inconsistent data point is found, geologists ask the question:
"Is this date wrong, or is it saying the current geological time scale
is wrong?" In general, the former is more likely, because there is such
a vast amount of data behind the current understanding of the time scale,
and because every rock is not expected to preserve an isotopic system for
millions of years.&nbsp; However, this statistical likelihood is <I>not</I>
assumed, it is <I>tested</I>, usually by using other methods (e.g., other
radiometric dating methods or other types of fossils), by re-examining
the inconsistent data in more detail, recollecting better quality samples,
or running them in the lab again. Geologists search for an explanation
of the inconsistency, and will not arbitrarily decide that, "because it
conflicts, the data must be wrong."

<P>If it is a small but significant inconsistency, it could indicate that
the geological time scale requires a small revision. This happens regularly.&nbsp;
The continued revision of the time scale as a result of new data demonstrates
that geologists <I>are</I> willing to question it and change it. The geological
time scale is far from dogma.

<P>If the new data have a large inconsistency (by "large" I mean orders
of magnitude), it is far more likely to be a problem with the new data,
but geologists are not satisfied until a specific geological explanation
is found and tested.&nbsp; An inconsistency often means something geologically
interesting is happening, and there is always a tiny possibility that it
could be the tip of a revolution in understanding about geological history.
Admittedly, this latter possibility is <I>VERY</I> unlikely. There is almost
zero chance that the broad understanding of geological history (e.g., that
the Earth is billions of years old) will change. The amount of data supporting
that interpretation is immense, is derived from many fields and methods
(not only radiometric dating), and a discovery would have to be found that
invalidated practically all previous data in order for the interpretation
to change greatly.&nbsp; So far, I know of no valid theory that explains
how this could occur, let alone evidence in support of such a theory, although
there have been highly fallacious attempts (e.g., the classic <A HREF="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/moon-dust.html">"moon
dust"</A>, <A HREF="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-age-of-earth.html#magnetic">"decay

<P><A NAME="specific"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Specific Examples: When Radiometric
Dating "Just Works" (or not)</FONT></B>
<H4>
A poor example</H4>
There are many situations where radiometric dating is not possible, or
where a dating attempt will be fraught with difficulty.&nbsp; This is the
inevitable nature of rocks that have experienced millions of years of history:
not all of them will preserve their age of origin intact, not every rock
will have appropriate chemistry and mineralogy, no sample is perfect, and
there is no dating method that can effectively date rocks of <I>any</I>
age or rock type.&nbsp; For example, methods with very slow decay rates
will be poor for extremely young rocks, and rocks that are low in potassium
(K) will be inappropriate for K/Ar dating.&nbsp; The real question is what
happens when conditions are ideal, versus when they are marginal, because
ideal samples should give the most reliable dates.&nbsp; If there are good
reasons to expect problems with a sample, it is hardly surprising if there
are!

<P>For example, in the "Dating Game" appendix of his <A HREF="#Lubenow92">"Bones
of Contention" book (1992)</A>, Marvin&nbsp; Lubenow provided an example
of what happens when a geologically complicated sample is dated -- it can
be very difficult to analyze. He discussed the "KBS tuff" near Lake Turkana
in Africa, which is a redeposited volcanic ash. It contains a <I>mixture</I>
of minerals from a volcanic eruption and detrital mineral grains eroded
from other, older rocks. It is also a comparatively "young" sample, approaching
the practical limit of the radiometric methods employed (conventional K/Ar
dating), particularly at the time of the initial dating attempts in 1969.&nbsp;
If the age of this unit were not so crucial to important associated hominid
fossils, it probably would not have been dated at all because of the potential
problems. After some initial and prolonged troubles over many years, the
bed was eventually dated successfully by careful sample preparation that
eliminated the detrital minerals.&nbsp; Lubenow's work is fairly unique
in characterising the normal scientific process of refining a difficult
date as an arbitrary and inappropriate "game", and documenting the history
of the process in some detail, as if such problems were typical.&nbsp;
Another example is <A HREF="#Wood78">"John Woodmorappe's" paper on radiometric
dating (1979)</A>, which adopts a "compilation" approach, and gives only
superficial treatment to the individual dates.&nbsp; Among other problems
documented in <A HREF="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/woodmorappe-geochronology.html">an
FAQ by Steven Schimmrich</A>, many of Woodmorappe's examples neglect the
geological complexities that are expected to cause problems for some radiometrically-dated
samples.
<H4>
A good example</H4>
By contrast, the example presented here is a geologically simple situation
-- it consists of several primary (i.e. <I>not</I> redeposited) volcanic
ash deposits with a diverse dateable mineral assemblage (multiple minerals
and methods are possible), found in fossil-bearing sedimentary rocks in
western North America. It demonstrates how consistent radiometric data
can be when the rocks are more suitable for dating. For most geological
samples like this, radiometric dating "just works".&nbsp; Consider this
stratigraphic section from the Bearpaw Formation of Saskatchewan, Canada
<A HREF="#ref1">(Baadsgaard et al., 1993)</A>:
<BR>&nbsp;

section is measured in metres, starting with 0m at the bottom (oldest).</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>


<P>This section is important because it places a limit on the youngest
age for a specific ammonite shell -- <I>Baculites reesidei</I> -- which
is used as a zonal fossil in western North America. It consistently occurs
below the first occurrence of <I>Bacultes jenseni</I> and above the occurrence
of <I>Baculites cuneatus</I> within the upper part of the Campanian, the
second to last "stage" of the Cretaceous Period in the global geological
time scale. The biostratigraphic situation can be summarized as a vertically-stacked
sequence of "zones" defined by the first appearance of each ammonite species:
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="560" >

<P><B>Figure 4.</B> <I>Baculites</I> ammonite zones.&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>


<P>About 40 of these ammonite zones are used to subdivide the upper part
of the Cretaceous Period in this area.&nbsp; Dinosaurs and many other types
of fossils are also found in this interval, and in broad context it occurs
shortly before the extinction of the dinosaurs, and the extinction of all
ammonites. The Bearpaw Formation is a marine unit that occurs over much
of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and it continues into Montana and North Dakota
in the United States, although it adopts a different name in the U.S. (the
Pierre Shale), mainly for historical and political reasons, rather than
any great geological difference.

<P>The uppermost ash bed, dated by three independent methods (K/Ar, U/Pb,
and Rb/Sr), and from as many as three different minerals (felspar, biotite,
and zircon), yields a date of about 72.5 +- 0.4 million years ago (Ma)
(weighted mean of several analyses. The numbers above are just summary
values). The results for the lower ash bed, although not as complete as
for the upper ash bed (only the Rb/Sr isochron method -- the U/Pb isochron
was discordant, indicating the minerals did not preserve the date), give
the expected result from superpositional relationships -- it is older by
about a million years (73.65 +- 0.59 Ma), taking the mean values.

<P>Other examples yield similar results - i.e. compatible with the expectations
from the stratigraphy. For example, <A HREF="#ref2">Baadsgaard and Lerbekmo
(1988)</A> dated the age of the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K/T) boundary using
three methods (K/Ar, Rb/Sr, and U/Pb, again using multiple minerals) at
three localities in the U.S. and Canada. Theoretically, the K/T boundary
should be younger than the <I>Baculites reesidei</I> zone mentioned above,
because the K/T boundary occurs stratigraphically above this level in the
same area and globally. The result? 64.3+-1.2 million years ago is the
weighted average from the three localities, and almost all the results
are within 1 million years of each other.&nbsp; The results are therefore
highly consistent given the analytical uncertainties in any measurement.

<P><A HREF="#ref3">Eberth and Braman (1990)</A> described the vertebrate
paleontology and sedimentology of the Judith River Formation, a dinosaur-bearing
unit that occurs stratigraphically below the <I>Baculites reesidei</I>
zone (the Judith River Formation is below the Bearpaw Formation).&nbsp;
It should therefore be older than the results from <A HREF="#ref1">Baadsgaard
et al. (1993)</A>.&nbsp; An ash bed near the top of the Judith River Fm.
yields a date of 76.11+-0.22 million years ago, while one almost 100m lower
yields a date of 78.2+-0.2 million years ago <A HREF="#ref3">(Eberth and
Braman, 1990, figure 5)</A>. Again, this is compatible with the age determined
for the <I>Baculites reesidei</I> zone and its relative stratigraphic position,
and even with the relative position of the two samples within the same
formation.

<P>How do these dates compare to the (then current) geological time scale?
<A HREF="#ref6">Harland et al.</A> proposed a time scale in 1982 on the
basis of data then available, and prior to the specific studies cited above.
Here are the numbers they applied to the geological boundaries in this
interval, compared to the numbers in the newer studies:

<P>&nbsp;

<TR>
<TD ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/faqs/dating/lateK.gif" HEIGHT=379 WIDTH=525>&nbsp;

et al., 1982</A> time scale. [1] is <A HREF="#ref1">Baadsgaard et al. (1993)</A>;

and Braman (1990)</A>.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>


<P>As you can see, the numbers in the rightmost column are basically compatible.
Skeptics of radiometric dating procedures sometimes claim these techniques
should not work reliably, or only infrequently, but clearly the results
are similar: for intervals that should be about 70-80 million years old,
radiometric dates do not yield (for example) 100 or 30 million years, let
alone 1000 years, 100 000 years or 1 billion. Most of the time, the technique
works exceedingly well to a first approximation.

<P>However, there are some smaller differences. The Cretaceous/Tertiary
boundary dates differ slightly, but are within the measurement uncertainties
of the new date. The date for the <I>Baculites reesidei</I> zone is at
least 0.1 million years off (taking the outside limit of the data uncertainty),
and is below the Campanian/Maastrichtian boundary, so the inconsistency
could be even larger. What to do? Well, standard scientific procedure is
to collect more data to test the possible explanations -- is it the time
scale or the data that are incorrect?

<P><A HREF="#ref7">Obradovich (1993)</A> has measured a large number of
high-quality radiometric dates from the Cretaceous Period, and has revised
the geological time scale for this interval. Specifically, he proposes
an age of 71.3 million years for the Campanian/Maastrichtian boundary above
the <I>Baculites jenseni</I> ammonite zone, based on <I>independent</I>
dates from other locations. This is completely compatible with the data
in <A HREF="#ref1">Baadsgaard et al. (1993)</A>, making it likely the revised,
younger date for the Campanian/Maastrichtian boundary is the correct one
versus <A HREF="#ref6">Harland et al. (1982)</A>. The other dates are completely
consistent with a lower boundary for the Campanian of 83+-1 million years
ago, as suggested by <A HREF="#ref6">Harland et al. (1982)</A> (which Obradovich
revises to 83.5+-0.5 Ma). In summary, it looks like the Campanian/Maastrichtian
boundary of <A HREF="#ref6">Harland et al. (1982)</A> was a little off,
but everything else is basically consistent to within the uncertainties
of measurement.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><A NAME="conclusions"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Conclusions</FONT></B>

<P>Skeptics of conventional geology might think scientists would expect,
or at least prefer, every date to be perfectly consistent with the current
geological time scale, but realistically, this is not how science works.
The age of a particular sample, and a particular geological time scale,
only represents the <I>current</I> understanding, and science is a process
of refinement of that understanding. In support of this pattern, there
is an unmistakable trend of smaller and smaller revisions of the time scale
as the dataset gets larger and more precise (<A HREF="#ref6">Harland et
al. 1982, p.4-5</A>). If something were seriously wrong with the current
geologic time scale, one would expect inconsistencies to grow in number
and severity, but they do not.

<P>For example, estimates of the age of boundaries in the Tertiary regularly
varied by 20-30% in the 1930s to 1970s. Since that time, they have varied
by much smaller amounts, rarely approaching 5% (again refer to <A HREF="#ref6">Harland
et al., 1982, p.4-5</A>). The same trend can be observed for other time
periods. <A HREF="#Palmer83">Palmer (1983)</A> and <A HREF="#ref8">Harland
et al. (1990)</A> present a more recent proposal for the geological time
scale, demonstrating that change is still occurring. The latter includes
an excellent diagram summarizing comparisons between earlier time scales
<A HREF="#ref8">(Harland et al., 1990, p.8)</A>. Since 1990, there have
been still more revisions by other authors, such as <A HREF="#ref7">Obradovich
(1993)</A> for the Cretaceous Period, and <A HREF="#Gradetal95">Gradstein
et al. (1995)</A> for the entire Mesozoic.

<P>As another example, <A HREF="#ref4">Rogers et al. (1993)</A> and <A HREF="#ref5">Goodwin
and Deino (1989)</A> present radiometric dates that bracket the ages of
Late Cretaceous fossil occurrences (i.e. dates above and below the fossils)
and yield more results that are consistent with predictions from the current
time scale.&nbsp; This is not uncommon.&nbsp; Besides the papers mentioned
here, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of similar papers providing
bracketing ranges for fossil occurrences. The synthesis of work like this
by thousands of international researchers over many decades is what defines
geological time scales in the first place (refer to <A HREF="#ref6">Harland
et al., 1982</A>, <A HREF="#ref8">1990</A> for some of the methods). Although
geologists can and do legitimately quibble over the exact age of a particular
fossil or formation (e.g., is it 100 million years old or 110 million?),
and genuinely problematic samples do exist, claims that radiometric dating
is so unreliable that the calibration of the geological time scale could
be modified by several orders of magnitude (10000x, 1000x, or even 10x)
are ridiculous from a scientific standpoint. The data do not support such
an interpretation.&nbsp; The methods work too well most of the time.

<P>In addition, evidence from other aspects of geology (e.g., estimates
of depositional rate and rates of other geological processes) support the
great age of the Earth. Prior to the availability of radiometric dating,
and even prior to evolutionary theory, the Earth was estimated to be at
least hundreds of millions of years old <A HREF="#radiomet">(see above)</A>.
Radiometric dating has simply made the estimates more precise, and extended
it into rocks barren of fossils and other stratigraphic tools.

<P>The geological time scale and the techniques used to define it are not
circular. They rely on the same scientific principles as are used to refine
any scientific concept: testing hypotheses with data. There are innumerable
independent tests that can identify and resolve inconsistencies in the
data. This makes the geological time scale no different from other aspects
of scientific study.

<P>For potential critics: Refuting the conventional geological time scale
is not an exercise in collecting examples of the worst samples possible.&nbsp;
A critique of conventional geologic time scale should address the best
and most consistent data available, and explain it with an alternative
interpretation, because that is the data that actually matters to the current
understanding of geologic time.

<P><A NAME="note1"></A><SUP>1</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technically,
these geologic time scales are known as "geochronologic scales", and there
is a conceptually tricky duality to the scale between the rock, the time
represented by the rock, and the calibration of the relative time to an
absolute scale. A profusion of terms is applied to the different concepts,
and, confusingly to the uninitiated, to the names applied to subdivisions
of them (e.g., "Cretaceous"). Geologic "Periods" (time) and geologic "Systems"
(rock) are different concepts, even though the same label (e.g., "Cretaceous")
may be applied to them. The semantic difference exists to distinguish between
the different (but relatable) types of observations and interpretation
that go into them. For simplicity sake I am sticking to the concepts of
"relative" and "absolute" (numerical) time, because these are in common
use, and I am glossing over the dual nature of the subdivisions. These
issues are explained in much more detail in the <A HREF="#other">citations
mentioned in "Other Sources"</A> particularly <A HREF="#Blattetal91">Blatt
