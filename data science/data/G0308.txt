<P>
The output produced by <tt>grafic</tt> is straightforward.  The normalization
values and statistics of the random density and displacement fields are
printed on standard output, while there are two unformatted files giving the
density and particle data, and (optionally) one formatted file giving the
<b>a=1</b> linear matter power spectrum used.  If a large grid size is set in
<tt>grafic.inc</tt>, it may be some time between the last input (<tt>ido</tt>,
determining whether an unconstrained or constrained field is to be produced)
and the output of the statistics.  The statistics for the unconstrained
field include ensemble-average values of the rms density contrast and
displacement (<tt>mean sigma_delta, sigma_psi</tt>, the latter in units of
comoving Mpc).  The <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img186.gif"> statistic gives the sum of squares of the
standard normal deviates (unit-variance, zero-mean gaussian random variables)
generated for the random density field.  It may be compared with its mean
value, <tt>dof</tt> (which equals the number of grid points minus one; one degree
of freedom is eliminated because the density fluctuation field has zero
mean).  <tt>Grafic</tt> also outputs a standardized deviation <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img187.gif"> indicating
by how much <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img188.gif"> deviates from its mean value.  Note that <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img189.gif"> for
the unconstrained field is <i>not</i> related to the magnitude of any imposed
constraint.
<P>
If the user applies constraints, statistics are printed out for each
constraint next.  First are the values of the constraint and a
suitably defined <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img190.gif"> for the unconstrained field  (for one
constraint of standardized value <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img191.gif">, it is <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img192.gif">); the
``sampled'' and ``desired'' values differ because the constraint has not
yet been imposed.  <tt>Grafic</tt> indicates when it begins to compute a
constrained realization.  When it is finished, it prints the values of
the constraints computed from the actual density field.  They should
match very precisely the constraints imposed by the user in subroutine
<tt>constr.f</tt>.
<P>
The penultimate set of statistics printed by <tt>grafic</tt> are the rms and
maximum density fluctuation and displacement, and <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img193.gif"> and the number
of degrees of freedom, for the final random realization at expansion
factor <b>a=1</b> (before the fields are rescaled back to the linear regime).
The rms values should be close (but not equal) to the ensemble-average
values printed out earlier; the maximum values are, of course, several
times larger.  (A 5-standard deviation value is not uncommon on even a
<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img194.gif"> grid.)  If no constraints are imposed, <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img195.gif"> and <tt>dof</tt> given
here agree with those for the unconstrained realization; otherwise <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img196.gif">
is reduced and <tt>dof</tt> is decreased by the number of constraints.
<P>
Finally, <tt>grafic</tt> outputs the expansion factor <tt>astart</tt> to which
it rescales the density fluctuation, displacements, and velocities.
Because the rescaling is done so that the maximum <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img197.gif">,
<tt>astart</tt> is related to the reciprocal of the maximum <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img198.gif">
printed out for <b>a=1</b>.  (In an Einstein-de Sitter universe <tt>astart</tt>
exactly equals the reciprocal because linear density fluctuations grow in
proportion to <b>a</b>; in other models the linear growth factor is computed to
give the correct starting time.)  The statistics for the density fluctuation
and displacement fields are then extrapolated back to <tt>astart</tt>.  Most
users will be concerned only with this final set of statistics.
<P>
If the user gives the appropriate input, <tt>grafic</tt> produces an ascii
file <tt>power.dat</tt> giving the linear matter power spectrum at <b>a=1</b>.
The first line contains the spectral slope <b>n</b> and normalization constant
input by the user; the latter is negative if the normalization is based
on <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img199.gif"> and positive if it is set by <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img200.gif">.  After
this header follow 201 lines of <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img201.gif">, with <b>k</b> logarithmically
sampled from the minimum and maximum values entered by the user.  Note:
<b>k</b> has units of Mpc<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img202.gif"> and the power spectrum has units of Mpc<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img203.gif">.
COSMICS does not use units of <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img204.gif"> Mpc for length, nor does it use
improperly defined power spectra.  <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img205.gif"> is a spectral density; it must
be multiplied by a <b>k</b>-space volume element to give the power.   Some
experts define <b>P</b> so that the power is <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img206.gif">; the
absence of factors <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img207.gif"> from equation (<A HREF="node10.html#norm">5</A>) shows
that COSMICS is based on the power being <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img208.gif">.
<P>
<tt>Grafic</tt> produces two unformatted (binary) files containing the density
fluctuation field and deformed lattice positions and velocities at
expansion factor <tt>astart</tt>.  These files provide the input needed for
nonlinear evolution codes.  The first file, <tt>delta.dat</tt>, contains
<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img209.gif"> on the lattice and is written as follows:
<BR><tt>
write(10) np1,np2,np3,dx,astart,omegam,omegav,H0<BR>
write(11) (((delta(i,j,k),i=1,np1),j=1,np2),k=1,np3)
        <BR>
</tt>
(Actually, in the program it is written as a one-dimensional array, but
that is equivalent to the three-dimensional array as shown above.)
The lattice size is (<tt>np1</tt>,<tt>np2</tt>,<tt>np3</tt>); these numbers
are set in <tt>grafic.inc</tt> before <tt>grafic</tt> is built.
<P>
The final file, <tt>p3m.dat</tt>, gives <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img210.gif"> on the lattice
(see eq. <A HREF="node8.html#zeld">4</A>) at expansion factor <tt>astart</tt>.  The units of
<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img211.gif"> are comoving Mpc; those of <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img212.gif"> are proper km s<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img213.gif">.
They are written as one-dimensional arrays because it is more natural to
think of a particle list as being one-dimensional:
<BR><tt>
write(10) npart,np1,np2,np3,dx,epsilon,astart,omegam,omegav,H0,
        <BR>
&amp; dt2,etat,nstep,ekin,egrav,egint,nrec<BR>
write(11) ((x(i,j),i=1,3),j=1,npart)<BR>
write(11) ((v(i,j),i=1,3),j=1,npart)<BR>
</tt>
Most of the parameters in the two header lines have been discussed already
(note that <tt>dx</tt> and <tt>epsilon</tt> have units of comoving Mpc, and
<tt>H0</tt> has the natural units); of those that have not, the most
important are <tt>npart</tt> = <tt>np1*np2*np3</tt> (the number of particles)
and <tt>nrec</tt>, which determines how many records are to be used for
writing the positions and velocities.  In most cases, the user will want
to set <tt>nrec</tt> = 1 in <tt>grafic.inc</tt>, in which case <tt>x</tt> and
<tt>v</tt> are written with one record each as shown above.  However, for
very large <tt>npart</tt> and computers with inefficient use of I/O buffers,
it may be difficult or impossible to write <tt>3*npart</tt> floating-point
numbers as one record.  In that case, increase <tt>nrec</tt>, and examine
the code to see how to read the data back again.  The parameters that
we have not discussed are specific to the author's p3m code.
