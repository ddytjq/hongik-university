      <p><font face="Eurostile">The fighting issue is a very emotional one. 
  It evokes strong sentiments from people on both sides of the issue. On the
  one hand, we have highly-respected, intelligent people in the industry
 who  believe fighting has no place in the game. Opponents of fighting believe
  that it adds nothing and that its continued presence prevents hockey from
  being attractive to a larger audience. On the other hand, we have equally
  respected, intelligent people in the industry who believe the elimination
  of fighting will lead to escalation of other, far more dangerous forms
of   contact, raised sticks, for example. The National Hockey League has
systematically   reduced the role of fighting over the last dozen years or
so through a series   of rule changes. The instigator penalty, the third-man
in rule, the anti-brawling   rules and the restriction of fights to actual
playing time have all produced   a significant reduction in the number of
fights which occur.</font> </p>

        <font face="Eurostile">In the NHL, injuries occur on the ice as a 
result   of the violence that seems inherent with the sport. "These guys make
big  bucks to play hockey," one might argue. "So they get hurt. That's what
they're   paid for."</font>                               
      <p><font face="Eurostile">Maybe that's a valid argument. But let's examine
the message that rough play and fights are setting for young hockey players
around the world. If the heroes of the sport go around bashing each other
and getting into fights at the drop of a hat--or puck--is it okay for our
young players to do the same?</font> </p>
                                   
      <p><font face="Eurostile">Just as Hollywood needs to consider the messages
   it's sending to our young people, so too does the NHL need to be aware

     NHL sad model for youth hockey&nbsp;</a>

      By William Houston <br>
     Sports Reporter&nbsp;                               
      <p>The problems that afflict youth hockey in Canada are learned and 
  copied from the most influential organization in the game. </p>
                                   
      <p>The National Hockey League sets the agenda, not just for professional
   leagues in North America, but for all levels of hockey in Canada. </p>
                                   
      <p>Children imitate their favourite players, volunteer coaches use NHL
strategies and association heads and parents look to the top pro league 
as the standard to which youth hockey should aspire. Today, that standard 
  is based on size, aggression, obstructionism and, to a lesser extent, fighting.

      <p>What is it that captivates the small legion of fans (a few million 
  of the 300 million that live in the U.S. and Canada) who truly savor the 
 sport of ice hockey? </p>
                                   
      <p>These questions are raised -- again -- following the most recent

game  five during the Maple Leafs-Devils playoff series.&nbsp; </p>

 Penguin superstar Mario Lemieux's return</a>
      to hockey after three years of retirement. In that article, Hazen suggested

      <p><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><font size="-1">
     "Yet for newbies, the fighting in hockey continues to baffle. In Lemieux 
  s third game back, a nationally televised Friday night game, viewers were 
  treated to an embarrassing first-period fight between Penguin tough guy 
Matthew  Barnaby (he s a bit more than a simple goon, but not much) and Canadien
  right wing Aaron Asham. It was a tortured pas de deux of jersey tugging
punctuated  by an occasional powerful noogie, while two referees stood around
like timid  schoolchildren for a full minute."</font></font> </p>

     It was the chop heard around the world, at least the hockey world. Marty 
  McSorley brazenly whacked Donald Brashear and brought back an old debate 
 bigger than ever.&nbsp; </p>
                                   
      <p>Has hockey, admittedly a rough, tough game, veered out of control, 
  too dangerous to life and limb? Dirty play is up, particularly targeting 
 premier players. Now, presumably, it will all be sorted out, not on the ice,
 but in court where the charge is assault with a hockey stick. </p>

      <p>For 18 years, Dr. Dennis Pitt has been trying hard to convince players
   in his own hockey league to wear masks that provide full facial protection.
   Realizing the difficulties he faced convincing individual players, Pitt
 changed his game plan. Since January he's been working with the 500-member
 Ottawa Academy of Medicine, the local branch society of the Ontario Medical
 Association, in an attempt to gather national support to encourage major
hockey bodies like the NHL to make full facial protection mandatory. The
issue gained national attention last March when Toronto Maple Leaf defenceman
Bryan Berard, 23, was seriously hurt in one eye by an errant stick. The injury
ended his career.&nbsp;       </p>

   in this area is needed to identify risk factors and potentially implement
   prevention strategies to reduce groin and abdominal strain injury at all
  levels of play.&nbsp; </p>
