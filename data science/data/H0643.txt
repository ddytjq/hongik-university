<h3>Director's Dialogue - Adapt or Die!</h3>
by Dr. J. Talbot, Acting Director<br>
<img src="dirdial.gif" align="right" border="1" WIDTH="191" HEIGHT="229">
<p>Without a doubt, the past year has been one of the most turbulent in the history of the Provincial Laboratory of Public Health in Northern Alberta. It has been a year in which we have seen the formation of the new Regional Health Authorities and their assumption of new responsibilities and new administrative structures as well as a massive decrease in the budget which occurred on top of a 5% reduction in salaries of the individuals involved in health care.   The Microbiology Laboratory at the University of Alberta Hospital is functioning with the same level and increased complexity of specimens, but with 40% fewer people than a year ago.  </p>
<p>Coping with this magnitude of change has required a sustained effort from every individual in the organization. Probably the single most helpful statement that has guided us through this time was given by Dr. Tom Noseworthy. Dr. Noseworthy, now the Chairman of the Department of Public Health Service, said that it had been his experience that confronted with the necessity of change, people chose one of two paths. </p>
<p>One group quietly goes about gathering the resources that they need to accomplish the change quickly and competently and with the least amount of dislocation possible. The second group sets about collecting reasons why they should not have to change. </p>
<p>One thing both Microbiology and Public Health teaches us by example is the necessity to adapt to changing conditions, or die. <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, when confronted with penicillin in 1945 could easily have made the case that penicillin was not a threat to its existence. Very small amounts  of the antibiotic were being used  (so little that  penicillin was recrystallized from a patients urine for re-use) it was extremely expensive to manufacture and all attempts to scale it up to industrial size doses had failed. Or the bacterium could choose to manufacture a beta-lactamase. It is unfortunate for us that the <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> chose to adapt, but it is a useful lesson to learn.  It is also interesting that so  much of the antibiotic resistance information is easily packaged in portable genetic units like plasmids and transposons; almost 
as if the bacteria wish to share this information to help others of their kind. </p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to share some of the lessons that we have learned in this challenging year. </p>
<p>Firstly, <b>people, people, people</b>. Bill Albritton, the previous director, used to ask people who would walk in his office - &quot;What is the problem you need solved? Is it people, space or money?&quot; Then he would catch himself and say  - &quot;Never mind, even when it&#146;s about space or money, it is still about people&#148;&quot; Until labs are fully automated (and I hope that day comes one day after I have left), people are its greatest resource, opportunity, problem and reason for existing. </p>
<p>We believe that most people do not come to work primarily for the money. They come to work firstly because there is a deep seated human need to do work of value.  Secondly, they like to come to work to be with their friends, to meet and share experiences with other humans. 
Thirdly, it&#146;s the money. The importance of listing them in this order is that people who think that the work that they do matters and enjoy the place that they work at, are less interested in the level of monetary return (although I don&#146;t recommend this as a management technique), whereas it can be very difficult to get people to work at meaningless jobs with people who they don&#146;t enjoy, regardless of the amount of money they are paid. In times of great change, it can be a very powerful technique to make sure that people still enjoy working with one another and that the value of the work they do is communicated back to them on a regular basis. </p>
<p>Secondly, if your organization doesn't have a clear idea of what it&#146;s doing and where it&#146;s going, 
someone else will. Many people in laboratories believe that the purpose of their existence is to test specimens. At the University of California in San Diego,  I was trained that the purpose of every laboratory is information management. Laboratories are not just about testing the specimen; they are about helping the nurse or the physician collect the best possible specimen, getting it to the laboratory in the best possible time, analyzing the information both on the individual specimens and as a group to help people do their jobs better. In addition, there are the longer term necessities for keeping information current, such as research, to ensure 
that Albertans do not receive progressively more obsolete testing.</p>
<p>Thirdly, in time of rapid change, leadership is not just nice to have - it is an absolute necessity. The advantages of demonstrating leadership are that having a goal in times of uncertainty gives people a target. This is important psychologically because it means that there is a purpose for the stress and workload that people are enduring. It is also useful because it is much easier to accept an adverse event like severance, if it is for a higher purpose. Finally, from a practical standpoint, leadership is important because it is much harder to hit a moving target that it is one which is hunkering down waiting for the next blow.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there is one other observation I would like to share. One of the great strengths of the health care profession is a tendency to care more about other peoples welfare than that of our own. During times of change, it is very important that each of us monitor our own levels of stress and of those that we care about around us, so that we can aid them. If we are prepared to offer help, we must also be prepared to accept it. One of the things that we have noticed, is that as people have left the organization, they do so often without a formal acknowledgment of their departure. We have found it very useful to have a celebration so that their departure does not go unnoticed. We do so to indicate to them as clearly as we can, that we value their previous contributions to the fight against disease and that they should be proud of that achievement. We have been proud to be their colleagues in arms. </p>
<p>I  hope that this proves useful to someone. If any of you have experiences from your organizations of strategies that have helped through transition period, I would very much like to hear from you. Please feel free to write, fax or email. </p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
