  THE ACCOUNT<br></b></font>
  Falcon Club is a specialist account developed for the age range, 16 to 23, to offer a secure home for your savings.
  <br><br>
  As it's a period in your life when you're most likely to make changes, a suitable savings account will be a vital asset. The next few years could see you going to college, buying a car, taking foreign holidays with your friends, buying a house or even getting married and it's at times such as these when a savings account will prove to be invaluable.
  <br><br>
  Falcon Club has been developed with subtle differences over a standard savings account. The account also offers a range of gifts to celebrate your 17th, 18th and 21st birthdays.
  <br><br>
  Above all it offers an attractive interest rate to ensure that any savings, no matter what their size, will grow rapidly, helping you to achieve your next goal in life. We also offer friendly advice regarding the development of your finances, whether as a student or as you embark on a career.

  <br><br>
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>CLAIMING YOUR CLUB GIFTS</b></font>
  <br>
  When you open a Falcon Club account you will be given a set of vouchers which are to be used to claim your gifts on or around your 17th, 18th and 21st birthdays. You must take your voucher to your nearest Branch or Agency having filled in your name, address, birthdate and account number. You will then be offered a choice of incentive which will be entered onto the voucher. The gift will then be sent to your home address within 28 days. Please note that minimum balances are applicable when claiming these gifts. See "<b>7.Incentives</b>" in Terms and Conditions for further details.
  <br><br>
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>INTEREST PAYMENTS</b></font>
  <br>
  Interest is paid to the account annually on the 31st December.
  <br>
  Current interest rates will be supplied to you on request and are on display in all Branch and Agency offices.
  <br><br>
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>INCOME TAX</b></font>
  <br>
  Interest will be paid after deduction of income tax at the lower rate or, subject to the required certification, gross. Registration forms are available from any of the Society's Branches or Agencies, or direct from the Inland Revenue. If you have <a class=s5 href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readermain.html" target=_blank>Adobe Acrobat Reader</a> click <a class=s5 href="http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/pdfs/r85.pdf" target=_blank>here to download the R85 form</a>. If you are a non-taxpayer you will be able to claim repayment of this tax directly from the Inland Revenue. You can also claim a repayment of tax, if your taxable income falls within the starting rate band and you are eligible to pay less tax than the amount deducted from your interest. Individuals who are liable at the higher rate of income tax will have to pay additional tax on the interest to cover the difference between the tax deducted and the higher rate tax due.
  <br><br>
  The Society is required to supply the Inland Revenue with details of all interest paid or credited to investors each year.
