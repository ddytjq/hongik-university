<h3> Abstract </h3>
</center>

Development of advanced technique to identify gene
structure is one of the main challenges of the
Human Genome Project. Discriminant analysis was applied 
to the construction of recognition functions for various
components of gene structure. Linear discriminant functions
for splice sites, 5'-coding, internal exon, and 3'-coding
region recognition have been developed. A gene structure prediction
system FGENE has been developed based on the exon recognition 
functions. We compute a graph of mutual compatibility of 
different exons and present a gene structure models as paths of
this directed acyclic graph. For an optimal model selection
we apply a variant of dynamic programming algorithm to search for
the path in the graph with the maximal value of the corresponding
discriminant functions.  Prediction by FGENE for 185 complete 
human gene sequences has 81% exact exon recognition accuracy and
91% accuracy at the level of individual exon nucleotides with the correlation
coefficient (C) equals 0.90.  Testing FGENE on 35 genes not used in 
the development of discriminant functions shows 71% accuracy of exact
exon prediction and 89% at the nucleotide level (C=0.86). FGENE
compares very favorably with the other programs currently used to 
predict protein-coding regions. Analysis of uncharacterized human sequences
based on our methods for splice site (HSPL, RNASPL), internal exons 
(HEXON), all type of exons (FEXH) and human (FGENEH) and bacterial 
(CDSB) gene structure prediction and recognition of human and bacterial
sequences (HBR) is available through the University of Houston, 
Weizmann Institute of Science network server and a WWW page of the 
Human Genome Center at Baylor College of Medicine.
