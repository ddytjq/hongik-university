      Time Trial Series</H1>

      <P>The Tarheel Sports Car Club is starting a two event Time Trial
      series for the 2000 season. Not to be confused with a racing
      series, a typical Time Trial event consists of morning practice
      sessions followed by three timed laps. There is no wheel to wheel
      racing during the practice session's or the time trial. The practice
      sessions, will be held under normal driving school protocol,
      that is passing on straight's after receiving a passing signal
      form the lead car. The Time Trial will have cars sufficiently
      spaced out, so that they should not come within close proximity
      of each other, with re-runs given in cases when they do. Events
      will be run under current SCCA SOLO1 rules, with the exception
      that driving suits will not be required, except for open wheel
      cars. Classes would include current SCCA SOLO1, SCCA CLUB Racing,
      and possibly marque club racing categories. <BR>
      </P>

      <P>Time Trials provide the participant with an opportunity to
      run in an competitive event without exposing themselves to risks
      greater than that of a typical driving school. A Time Trial is
      not a driving school. Participants must meet a minimum set of
      requirements and are issued a licence. Novices, people with little
      to no track experience, will be required to attend two CarGuy's
      Inc. schools before receiving a provisional licence. With the
      number of marque clubs regularly holding track driving schools
      and the success of organizations like CarGuys Inc., this state
      has developed an impressive pool of highly competent drivers,
      many of whom would like to be able to compete on track. Other
      than autocross, the only available option, in this part of the
      country, is club racing. <BR>
      </P>

      <P>Time Trials are the perfect venue to fill this gap, as it
      does not require a dedicated expendable race car. It is expected
      that some people, when exposed to Time Trials will move on to
      club racing, while some may feel it &quot;fills the need for
      speed&quot; without the stress, pressure, and associated risk
      of wheel to wheel club racing. <BR>
      </P>

      <P>Time Trials or Speed Trials, are by no means a new concept.
      The SCCA calls it SOLO1, and the south east has been running
      a successful SOLO1 series for many, many years. EMRA (Easter
      Motor Racing Association)has had a successful Time Trial program
      since the 1960's to supplement their club racing program. We
      feel this can be equally successful in North Carolina. <BR>
      </P>

      <P>The Tarheel Sports Car Club, is and has always been, an autocross
      club.We do have a significant minority of members active in track
      events, and have assembled an multi-club affiliated staff willing
      to run a series, it will not be possible to kick off this series
      without the participation of members from the various marque
      clubs. You know who you are, I'm referring to the &quot;Usual
      Suspects&quot; or &quot;Track Junkies&quot; out there. Ultimately,
      if the series proves successful, we hope the Marque Clubs will
      get involved directly and host an event per year, making this
      truly a multi-club state wide series.<BR>
      </P>

      <P>We should have no problem keeping costs below $180 for the
      weekend, our target is around the $165 range. However, we would
      like to include a social dinner and something better than a plaque
      of wood for a trophy. We are looking to secure an event at both
      Carolina Motorsports Park (long course) and VIR (club course).
      If you are interested in participating in such an event, please
      let us know.<BR>
      </P>
