    to turn to rain. By race 6 the rain came and the temperature dropped with the day ending
    with the onset of fog. Untroubled by these conditions was apprentice jockey Travis Creek
    who out rode his claim with victory in the first race but under the racing rules could
    complete the meeting with his 1 1/2kg claim. Travis Creek then went on to win the next
    three races taking his daily total to four of the eight races.</font></td>
