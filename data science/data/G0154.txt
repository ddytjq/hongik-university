<H2>ANNUAL REPORT </H2>
</center>
The network continued to be very active in its third year with
43 additional joint publications submitted to the refereed scientific 
literature over the period 1/10/98 to 30/9/99. In addition 8 jointly
authored contributions to conference proceedings were submitted. (See
attached publications list.)
<br><br>
Personnel changes within the Network were relatively minor over this
year with most of the Network's postdoctoral fellows remaining in
post. 
<br>
In February 1999 the Network underwent its mid-term review in Paris.
Both the external referee and the Commission representative were happy
with the functioning and the productivity of the Network.
<br><br>
The third Annual Meeting of the network was held over the period
30 August - 4 September 1999 in Asiago, Italy. Although attendance
was strictly limited to scientists from the participating sites,
almost 80 scientists took part. The meeting was very successful
in reporting on existing activity and in generating new collaborations.
Other smaller meetings are detailed in the following scientific
report.
<br><br>
<B> 1 Radio galaxies </B>
<br>
The main event in 1999 was that the first 8.2-m VLT Unit Telescope
(ANTU) was ``handed over'' to the scientists on April 1, 1999; its
first ``visiting astronomers'' at Paranal were astronomers from Leiden
carrying out a network programme.  One of VLT's major asset is its
excellent instrumentation.  A number of collaborative projects have
been started to use these facilities to study various classes of
distant galaxies, including very red galaxies, young and starforming
galaxies, dusty galaxies and galaxies that are good candidates for
being in extremely distant clusters. The aim is to obtain a good
census and understanding of the distant galaxy population.  Within
this context, a large VLT programme has recently been approved to 
obtain the deepest infrared images ever taken.
<br><br> 
<i> Scientific highlights </i>
<br>
<UL>

continuum break. 

<Li> 
Extremely deep NTT infrared imaging revealed a dozen z ~ 2.2
H-alpha emitting galaxies. The reality of these objects were
confirmed through VLT spectroscopy. 
</UL>
<br>
<i> Network activities </i>
<br>
The Sterrewacht Leiden organised a TMR workshop on hydrodynamic
aspects of galaxy formation and evolution at the Lorentz
Center at the Universiteit Leiden from March 8 to 10 1999.  The
workshop was visited mainly by advanced graduate students and young
postdocs from the network.  A significant fraction of the workshop was
devoted to a series of extended review talks by senior researchers on
hydrodynamics in general, certain aspects of its numerical
implementation, and the application to galaxy formation and evolution.
<br>
Exchanges: A number of young scientists have been involved in 
visits of order a week. The complete list is given in the 
section on secondments. 
<br><br>
<i> Progress with appointment of young researchers</i>
<br>
The young researcher being employed by the network in Leiden is Philip
Best (a number of other PhD students and post-docs are also involved
in network activities). Dr Best, originally from Cambridge, was
employed following the network's initial advertisement. He has
traveled to meetings at other sites of the network, and is now
involved in active collaborations with researchers in Leiden,
Cambridge, Paris and Munich.  Carlos de Breuck, a Belgium PhD
student,  has also been employed for a period of one year.
<br><br><br>
<B> 2a Evolution of cluster galaxies: </B>
<br>
A group of Network researchers from Cambridge, Durham and Padova have
completed an extensive spectroscopic catalogue of galaxies in 10 distant rich
clusters for which Hubble Space Telescope imaging was obtained earlier.  The
clusters span the redshift range z=0.37-0.56 and are the subject of a detailed
ground- and space-based study to investigate the evolution of galaxies as a
function of environment and epoch.  A direct comparison of the spectral
properties of the high-redshift cluster and field populations suggests that
the abundance of galaxies that formed stars in the recent past decreased  in
cluster environments by more than one order of magnitude in the last 5 billion
years, while such evolution is much more modest in the field.  This suggests
that the process or processes involved in producing such galaxies are either
substantially more effective in the cluster environment or that this
environment prolongs the visibility of the  post-star-formation phase. 
<br><br>
These data have also been used to investigate the nature of the different
cluster galaxy types,  including star-forming, poststarburst, and passive
galaxy populations, and to reproduce their basic properties using spectral
synthesis models developed within the Network.   The comparison of the spectra
of the distant galaxy populations with samples drawn from the local universe
leads us to identify a significant population of dust-enshrouded starburst
galaxies. The spectral and morphological properties of the distant cluster
galaxies indicate that either two different timescales and/or two different
physical processes are responsible for the spectral and morphological
transformation of galaxies in clusters. 
<br><br>
Finally, researchers in Durham and Cambridge have detected  dust in the
central galaxies of distant cooling-flow clusters. Although the sample is
still small, the detections have important implications  for the
interpretation of star formation in cooling-flow galaxies. 
<br><br><br>
<B> 2b Evolution of field galaxies:</B>
<br>
The pioneering study of star formation hidden by dust in extremely distant
galaxies using the SCUBA bolometer array at the UK James Clerk Maxwell
Telescope (JCMT) has continued to be a very active field of research within
the network. Reliable redshifts for 20 galaxies have been obtained, suggesting
that  the majority of the extragalactic background light in the submillimeter
is emitted by sources at z$<$3 and hence that the peak activity in highly
obscured sources (both Active Galactic Nuclei and starbursts) lies at
relatively modest redshifts. For some of these galaxies, molecular gas has
been detected for the  first time. The large molecular gas mass found in some
of the galaxies and their radio emission are consistent with the
interpretation that massive starbursts are taking  place,
and that  massive reservoirs of molecular gas are available to fuel the very
high rates of star formation detected. Two of the systems appear to be
associated with merger events which may evolve into present-day luminous
elliptical galaxies. 
<br><br>
At low redshift, Network researchers in Cambridge and Munich have  completed
an optical and near-infrared study of a large and representative  sample of 
nearby star-forming galaxies. The new data has been used  to characterize the
star-formation properties of the galaxies, including the  strength and age of
their current (or most recent) burst of star formation,  their  star-formation
rate and their total stellar mass. 
<br><br>
The Institute of Astronomy of the University of Cambridge has hosted several
visits of researchers from other network institutions (Munich, Paris, Durham, 
Leiden and Padova), to carry out collaborative research.  In addition, several
IoA members have visited other nodes (Padova, Durham, Paris, Munich) to work on
various collaborations an plan future research.
<br><br>
Dr Pierre-Alain Duc continued working at the IoA during this period as a
research fellow, funded by the Network.  He terminated his contract on
September 30th, and moved to the D\'epartement d'Astrophysique of the  
Commissariat \`a l'\'Energie Atomique, (CEA)  in Saclay, France, where he has
secured a permanent research post.   His main research activities were related
to the observational study of interacting and star-forming galaxies, and the
role of the environment in their formation and evolution.  He actively
collaborated with researchers in Cambridge, Paris and Padova within the
Network.
<br><br><br>
<B> 3 QSO absorption lines </B>
<br>
An invaluable and complementary point of view on the processes
governing the formation and evolution of galaxies is provided by the
study of the gaseous component of the universe as seen in quasar
absorption lines.
<br><br>
Their study has progressed in the direction of understanding the
extent, structure, metallicity and physical conditions of absorbing
halos at high redshift.
<br><br>
In particular the following key results have been achieved:
<br><br>
<UL>
<Li> Studies of galaxies and identification of absorbers in the
Hubble Deep Field South. <br> The multi-object capabilities of EMMI at the
ESO NTT and FORS1 at the ESO VLT have been used to determine the
redshifts of galaxies in the $50'' \times 50''$ STIS and in the $ 5'
\times 5'$ surrounding EIS field. Together with the unique database
under construction in the HDF-S this will allow us to study in the
best possible conditions the association between Lyman--alpha
absorptions detected by HST and galaxies, in particular in the
redshift range where a transition in the evolution of the Lyman forest
takes place.
<br><br>
<Li> QSO pairs and Groups.<br>
The observations of several 
closely separated QSO pairs and gravitationally lensed QSOs, 
providing two or more adjacent lines of sight, have made it possible to 
sample the size and clustering of the absorbers.
<br><br>
<Li> Metallic Absorbers and the Ionizing Background. <br>
A separation of the complex weak metal-line systems relating to the Lyman
forest into ``single-phase ionization'' components with accurate parameters
has yielded a large sample in the redshift range 1.9 < z < 4.4. No sudden
evolution near z = 3 is found in the column density ratio N(SiIV)/N(CIV),
contrary to previous indication. Comparisons of N(SiIV)/N(CIV) vs
N(CII)/N(CIV) from the observations, with CLOUDY derived values using
several model ionizing spectra, confirm the general dominance of a QSO
ionizing background at the lower redshifts but an additional strong and
eventually dominating stellar contribution is required progressively to
higher redshifts.
<br><br>
<Li> Simulations.<br>
Hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation in a cosmological context
have been used to investigate the intergalactic medium at redshifts 1 to 5.
These simulations are used to make mock QSO
spectra, which are the compared in detail to high-resolution
Lyman-alpha spectra taken with the HIRES spectrograph on the Keck
telescope. The low-redshift Lyman-alpha forest has been studied, the
influence of numerical resolution on simulated spectra, the influence
of cosmology and a method to measure the temperature of
the intergalactic medium based on the Lyman-alpha line widths was developed.
<br><br>
Methods for the recovery of the real space mass density field
from Lyman absorption in QSO spectra have been developed. It is hereby
assumed that the absorption is due to a photoionized intergalactic
medium which traces the mass distribution as suggested by recent
numerical simulations.  The methods are tested with mock spectra
obtained from numerical simulations.
</UL><br><br>
<B> 4 Population synthesis models</B>
<br>
The synthesis programmes, that already allowed one to
compute the ultraviolet-to-near-infrared spectral evolution
of stellar populations in a full range of metallicities,
were further improved and exploited in different ways.
<UL>
<Li> <i> Extension to submillimeter wavelengths.</i>
The Paris and Padova groups completed self-consistent models
of the spectral evolution at far-ultraviolet to submillimeter
wavelengths. This required to couple the population
synthesis models with a chemical evolution prescription and to
include the absorption and infrared-to-submillimeter emission
by the dust. Semi-empirical recipes were used to circumvent
major uncertainties in the dust modelling. The models were
tested successfully against observed spectra of nearby
spiral, starburst, and (ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies.<br>
<br>
<Li> <i> Inclusion of nebular emission.</i> The Paris and Padova
groups combined the synthesis programmes with standard
photo-ionization codes to compute emission-line spectra of
star-forming galaxies. The ionization of HII regions by young
stars and the production of emission lines are treated in a
consistent way with the history of star formation. The models
reproduce the observed ratios of the most commonly measured
emission lines (H-alpha, H$\beta$, [OII], [OIII]). Studies
are underway to evaluate the reliability of nebular star
formation indicators in distant galaxies.<br><br>

<Li> <i> Morphological versus spectral modelling.</i> The Padova
and Durham groups computed the ultraviolet-to-submillimeter emission
of galaxies extracted from semi-analytic models for which morphologies
(budge-to-disk ratio), star formation history, and warm and cold gas
contents are available. Chemical evolution and dust absorption and
emission were included self-consistently using the prescription
outlined above. The models reproduce, in particular, the wide
observed spread in infrared properties of spiral galaxies with
similar optical spectra.
</UL>
<br><br><br>
<B> 5 Semianalytic modelling </B>
<br>
Semi-analytic techniques have been extended this year in a number of 
new ways.
<br><br>
<UL>
<Li> <i> The evolution of black holes, quasars and radio galaxies.</i> 
G. Kauffmann (MPA) and M. Haehnelt (MPA and IoA) have extended the 
semi-analytic models to track the evolution of supermassive black holes 
in galaxies. They have demonstrated that a model in which supermassive 
black holes are formed and quasars are fuelled during major mergers 
can explain the observed evolution in quasar space density
and the relation between quasar and host galaxy luminosities at 
low redshifts. In collaboration with C. Kaiser (MPA), P. Best (Leiden) 
and H. Rottgering (Leiden), the models are currently being extended to 
study the redshift evolution of the sizes and environments of radio 
galaxies.
<br><br>
<Li> <i> Evolution of galaxies in clusters.</i>
B. Lanzoni, G. Mamon and F. Bouchet (IAP, Paris) are collaborating 
with V. Springel and S. White (MPA) to include semi-analytic recipes 
into high-resolution N-body simulations of cluster formation. This 
project will focus on the evolution of galaxy populations in
clusters at high redshift and how the observed trends in the star 
formation rates, morphologies and colours of galaxies can be understood.    
<br><br>
<Li> <i> Emission of galaxies at infrared wavelengths.</i> The 
collaboration of C. Lacey, C. Baugh, S. Cole and C. Frenk (Durham) with 
A. Bressan, G. Granato and L. Silva (Padova) has made considerable 
progress this year. The dust models of the Padova group have been 
successfully integrated with the semi-analytic models of the Durham 
group and the far infrared properties of galaxies in the local 
Universe, including the luminosity function of IRAS galaxies and the 
detailed spectral energy distributions of normal spirals and of 
starburst galaxies, are explained very successfully. At high redshifts, 
the models fail to reproduce the 850 micron number counts, indicating
more star formation may be occuring in starbursts in the real Universe 
than in the models.
</UL>
<br><br>
<B> 6 Simulations of galaxies and clusters</B>
<br>
<i> Scientific results:</i>
<br>
Progress in the area of simulations of galaxies and clusters continued
unabated during this reporting period, with major activity centred at
Durham and Munich, and some participation from Cambridge and Paris. 
This led to 10 
refereed publications and 5 conference proceedings involving researchers in
these three institutions, particularly the first two. Our programme
continued to exploit the network's access to two one of the largest
parallel supercomputers in Europe, the Crays-T3E at Garching and Edinburgh.
<br><br>
A considerable amount of effort was expended analysing the ``Hubble
volume''simulations, which were described in last year's report. Two
network papers analysing the statistical properties of the clustering
pattern in the simulations were completed and several more are in
progress. These cover topics such as the properties and distribution of
rich clusters (tens of thousands of which formed in each simulation), the
mass function of dark matter halos over an unprecedented range of scales,
and the construction of realistic mock catalogues of galaxies ideal for
analysing data from galaxy surveys (such as the ``PSCz'' and ``2dF''
surveys in which the network is involved).  
<br><br>
We recently completed the first large N-body/gasdynamical simulations
capable of resolving the formation of galaxies in representative volumes of
the Universe.  These simulations contained 2097152 dark matter particles
and the same number of gas particles, with a gas mass per particle of $\sim
2\times10^9 M_\odot$, and a gravitational softening of 10 kpc. The
simulations followed the formation of galaxies by gas cooling within dark
halos of mass a few times $10^{11}M_\odot$ and above. This is a
calculation that we had been struggling to perform for several years. The
breakthrough that made it possible was a novel treatment of the
intergalactic medium in which cool galactic gas is partially decoupled from
the hot cooling flow around it.  Over 2200 galaxies formed in our
simulation, with a distribution of K-band luminosities (obtained from a
spectral population synthesis model) in excellent agreement with
observations. We are currently investigating the demographics and
clustering properties of these galaxies as a function of time. Our
preliminary results show that the two-point correlation function of bright
galaxies in the model evolves rather little since $z=3$. At the present
day, it has a shape close to a power-law over four orders of magnitude in
amplitude, in good agreement with observations. The galaxies in a
flat model with a cosmological constant are antibiased relative to the mass
on small scales. These early results point to a remarkable success of these
models in matching the trends seen in the data.
<br><br>
Encouraging as our first results are, this is only a start. Apart from the
ongoing detailed analysis of these simulations, we are exploring further
the validity of the assumptions we have made in the treatment of the
intergalactic medium. This requires extensive testing via suites of
small-scale simulations which we have recently began. Beyond that, we are
focussing on an increasingly realistic treatment of the astrophysics of
galaxy formation, particularly star formation and feedback. Our codes
already include crude treatments of these processes but, at present, we
have little idea of how the simulation results are affected by different
parameterizations. We have recently began a systematic study of this
problem. This is a long-term programme that will occupy a substantial
fraction of our computing resources in the near future.
<br><br>
The simulations we have carried out this year represent substantial
progress towards our year-4 milestone (``compiling the largest
available suite of simulations of galaxy formation in differing
environments and in a variety of cosmogonies.'') By contrast, we have not
yet been able to achieve our year 2 milestone (understanding the
requirements for disk galaxies to form with the observed properties) which
proved to be more difficult than anticipated.  We are continuing work in
this problem.
<br><br>
<i> Scientific highlights:</i>
<br>
Our simulations of galaxy formation in cosmological volumes represent a
major advance in the subject. They are the first simulations ever in which
the formation of galaxies has been modelled within volumes large enough for
their clustering properties to be studied reliably. The referee of the
paper (Pearce et al 1999) referred to this work as ``heroic.'' For the
first time, we have now an understanding of the physical processes that
establish the clustering pattern of galaxies and a model (a cold dark
matter cosmogony with a flat geometry and a non-zero cosmological constant)
that reproduces the data remarkably well.
<br><br>
<i> Networking and coordinating activities:</i>
<br>
A meeting was held at Durham during Jan/13-14/1999 to discuss progress and
future plans in the area of cosmological simulations of galaxy
formation. In addition to network participants, this meeting also included
a few external colleagues (from the Virgo consortium) who often collaborate
with network participants. The discussions included coordination of the
science to be done with the ``Hubble volume'' simulations, progress in a
programme of simulations of the Lyman-alpha forest, and detailed
planning of our programme of gasdynamics simulations of galaxy formation.
<br><br>
<i> Appointment of young researchers:</i>
<br>
The contract of Dr.\ Fabio Governato, the first network postdoctoral
researcher appointed at Durham expired in Jan/99. Dr.\ Governato moved on to
a permanent post at the University of Milano. To replace him, we
advertised the post in the general advertisement issued by the network in
Dec/97. From a very competitive list of applicants, we offered the post to
Dr.\ Sergio Gelato, who began his activities on March/1/1999.  During this
reporting period, Dr.\ Fabio Governato continued his work on cosmological
simulations. Dr.\ Gelato started work also in the area of simulations. He
visited Munich during the year.
<br><br><br>
<B> 7 The Hubble Deep Field South </B>
<br><br>
Three network proposals for VLT time to study galaxies in the
Huble Deep Field South were successful: 
\parindent=10pt
<Li> A FORS proposal to study Lyman Break galaxies at redshifts
near 4.

<Li> A FORS proposal to search for galaxies corresponding to
the observed absorption line systems in the spectrum of the QSO in the
STIS field

<Li> An ISAAC proposal to measure rotation curves for disk
galaxies at redshifts beyond 1.

All three projects were successful in getting some data and reduction
is now underway. Further time has been requested for the first two.
