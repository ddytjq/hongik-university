<P>PHP is very powerful and is designed such that it can replace awk, sed, 
UNIX shell, Perl, Python, "C", C++ and Java.
<P>
<P>The object oriented features of PHP is developing very rapidly and in near future
will surpass the object oriented features of Java language. All the object oriented
features are implemented in PHP via <B>class</B> keyword just like in Java.
<P>If you build the CGI version of PHP, you can use it from the command
line simply typing: <CODE>php filename</CODE> where filename is the file you want to
parse. You can also create standalone PHP scripts by making the first
line of your script look something like:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    #!/usr/local/bin/php -q
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The "-q" suppresses the printing of the HTTP headers. You can leave off
this option if you like.
<P>If you want to use PHP as a stand-alone program, just like a shell script,
"C" or perl program, then use this technique:
<HR>
<PRE>
bash$ php -q filename.php
bash$ php -h
bash$ php -?
bash$ /usr/bin/php -?
bash$ php -i
</PRE>
<HR>

The command <I>php filename.php</I> will execute the file <I>filename.php</I>.
You are invoking the php program which you wrote in filename.php from the 
bash commmandline instead of from the web-browser.
<P>On Microsoft Windows platform you will bringup a MSDOS prompt from Start->Run->cmd
and put C:\Program Files\php\bin in your path environment and
<HR>
<PRE>
C:\> php -q filename.php
C:\> php -h
C:\> php -?
or
C:\> c:\Program Files\php\bin\php filename.php
</PRE>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="winapp"></A> <A NAME="ss19.1">19.1 Standalone MS Windows GUI applications using PHP</A>
</H2>

<P>Since PHP is general purpose scripting language and is like a <I>"glue"</I>
language, you can use it develop standalone MS Windows GUI applications.
PHP can be very easily combined with MS Windows C++ GUI classes to create
GUI applications. And developing applications with PHP is extremely fast
as it is a scripting language and it's runtime performance is also excellent
as compared with other scripting languages like Perl, Visual Basic and Python.
<P>PHP can also be used for developing standalone GUI applications for Linux/UNIX'es.
