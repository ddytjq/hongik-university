<P>
Tinkering, tinkering, tinkering - five hundred years ago, the Pueblo people of
northern New Mexico were following paths of cultural evolution that included
tinkering with new ways of relating to each other politically. But because their
progress along those paths was suddenly halted in 1540 by the arrival of the
Spanish, it's impossible to know exactly what kind of unification the Pueblos
might have achieved if left alone.
</P>
<P>
Imagine northern New Mexico's mostly empty Galisteo Basin, for example, as a new
center of civilization.
</P>
<P>
Didn't happen. But it might have.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Haas, a Chicago-based anthropologist working with the Santa Fe Institute
on the evolution of cultural complexity, says Francisco Coronado "encountered thriving communities of Pueblo people. The trajectory
of their world changed from that point on. If we look at where they were going,
that was altered unequivocally when the Spanish first arrived. The question is:
what was life like before the Spanish got there, and then how did it change?"
</P>
<P>
Haas, who is MacArthur Curator of North American Anthropology at Chicago's Field
Museum of Natural History and an SFI external faculty member, says about
sixty-five Pueblos, each with three hundred to three thousand rooms, were
occupied in the northern Rio Grande region at or shortly prior to the Spanish
arrival. Today, there are only sixteen Pueblos within the same area, and they are
all politically autonomous.
</P>
<P>
On July 16 at the James A. Little Theater at the New Mexico School for the Deaf,
Haas will discuss his work, including recent excavations at Pueblo ruins, in a
Community Lecture titled "New Mexico in 1500: Pueblo Life Before European
Contact."
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere throughout the New World, diseases brought by Europeans Ð including
smallpox, chicken pox, mumps, and measles Ð killed up to 90 percent of local
tribal populations. Haas wanted to establish whether a similarly severe
depopulation occurred in the northern Rio Grande region because of diseases that
may have arrived with the Spanish or moved along ancient trade routes decades in
advance of the Spanish.
</P>
<P>
Contacted at the Field Museum recently, Haas said two theoretical models have
been proposed for what might have happened to the Pueblo population.
<IMG SRC="images/kiva.jpeg"  alt="photo by William Clark" ALIGN=right BORDER="0">
</P>
<P>
"One model says the Rio Grande Pueblos went through the same decline Ð if not 90
percent depopulation, then 50 percent," he said. "The other model is that there
never was a population decrease."
</P>
<P>
His research and fieldwork have led him to agree with the no-depopulation model.
There are no accounts of such a devastation in the historical records and no
archaeological evidence either.
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was the region's climate - relatively cool and dry, at elevations of
five thousand feet and up - that prevented fomentation of Europe-spawned disease
among the Pueblos, Haas suggested. "That's the air-is-good argument," he said.
</P>
<P>
Haas starts with demography, because numbers elsewhere have been shown to be
linked to the sorts of political options open to a culture. "Different population
densities," he said, "are going to give you different opportunities for political
organization."
</P>
<P>
Sizes of populations and changes in their rates of growth are factors known to
have helped determine the forms of confederacy eventually created by other
societies. A larger population, rather than a smaller one, is more likely to be
bound together in larger political groups, perhaps even a centralized governing
system.
</P>
<P>
Even though some of the pueblos in what Haas called the "ethnographic present"
are related linguistically, they are "all independent of one another,
politically, socially, economically," Haas said. "That's a very exceptional,
almost unique phenomenon if you look around the world. In similar areas with
settled horticulturists, you have larger political bodies Ð confederacies."
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/ladder.jpeg" alt="photo by William Clark" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0" HSPACE="6">
Is the present-day autonomy an "artifact of colonialism," Haas wanted to know,
"or is it a manifestation of an ongoing pattern that precedes the Spanish?"
</P>
<P>
Of course, from the viewpoint of the Spanish authorities, it was better to have
the pueblos be politically separate from each other. "If each pueblo is
independent, you can control each of them better than if everybody is united -
divide and conquer," Haas said. "The Pueblo Revolt of 1680 showed what can happen
when everyone is united."
</P>
<P>
With his wife Winifred Creamer, an anthropologist who teaches at the University
of Northern Illinois, Haas conducted excavations last summer at the ruins of two
abandoned pueblos in the Galisteo Basin, south of Santa Fe, and examined other
sites there and elsewhere in the region. Haas and Creamer are co-authors of a
number of papers and a 1993 book, Stress and Warfare Among the Kayenta Anasazi of
the 13th Century A.D.
</P>
<P>
From historical records, Haas said, eight big Pueblos in the Galisteo Basin are
known to have been occupied at some time during the 1500s. Altogether, they
contain enough rooms for a population of about fifteen thousand - more than the
number of people who live there now. If there had been a depopulation of the
Pueblo populations in the years just before Coronado arrived, Haas would have
expected to find evidence of the calamity in the long-buried rooms of Pueblo San
Marcos and Pueblo Blanco.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to see the condition of the rooms when they were abandoned," Haas said.
"You're looking at the floor, seeing what's left. If you've got a pueblo ravaged
with disease, you should see signs that the people did not have time to clean
them out. If there had been warfare, you should see signs of burning, dead bodies
on the floor, smashed artifacts. What we're finding is that people just packed up
and left - with no signs of rapid abandonment due to warfare and disease."
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/walls.jpeg" alt="photo by William Clark" ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER="0" HSPACE="6">
Haas and Creamer said the Pueblo sites in the Galisteo basin were used
sequentially by populations that moved periodically from one to another in a
cycle of abandonment and reoccupation. The people would leave the pueblo after
being there for a generation of so, perhaps because of the depletion of firewood
and other resources in the immediate area. Then, a generation or so later - fifty
to seventy-five years after the initial abandonment, when the land would have had
time to replenish itself - the descendants of the original residents would return
and build new rooms on top of the old, ruined ones.
</P>
<P>
So abandonment doesn't necessarily reflect a 50 percent population decline, Haas
said. "Only 50 percent of the sites [in the Galisteo Basin] were occupied at one
time - and that was the normal pattern." Pueblo San Marcos, for example, has more
than three thousand rooms in several layers. But Haas said probably no more than
750 people lived there at one time.
</P>
<P>
So instead of fifteen thousand people living in the basin at or just prior to the
arrival of the Spanish, a more realistic population figure for the time would be
four thousand.
</P>
<P>
If this pattern of cyclical occupation was repeated throughout the northern Rio
Grande region Ð and evidence of it has been seen in Pueblo ruins at Arroyo Hondo
near Taos, for example, as well as at several other sites - then it is likely
that Pueblo populations never reached a critical mass for more centralized
government.
</P>
<P>
Evolution in human culture, including political development, is fundamentally
different than evolution in the purely biological realm, Haas noted. In biology,
variations are randomly produced. It's Darwinian. But in cultural evolution,
variations are not randomly produced. They are generated, he said, "by deliberate
selection - by thinking agents trying to solve problems."
</P>
<P>
In bio-evolution, he said, "an animal with longer tail feathers might find itself
more competitive in an environment - but it didn't grow those longer feathers to
become more competitive. And an animal might find itself more competitive because
it has grown bigger teeth - but it didn't grow those teeth, because it needs them
to eat a new species of dik-dik that has just entered the area. The process of
natural selection is more random than that."
</P>
<P>
In human cultural systems, variations are not random, Haas continued. "Humans are
tinkerers. They tinker to make things better." A human may plant two or three
seeds in a hole instead of one, for example, just to see what happens. If he gets
more crop, then he will continue planting more than one seed Ð and the
agricultural system has evolved another step.
</P>
<P>
Haas has joined with several other anthropologists and archaeologists in the SFI
working group on Culture as an Adaptive System. "To model human systems - which
are so vastly more complex than complex biological systems - you can't use random
variations," Haas said. "You have to have thinking agents directing variation."
You have to build tinkerers - thinking agents that act like humans - into any
computer program that attempts to model cultural evolution.
</P>
<P>
The program should be designed so the agents are under stress, picking solutions
to address that stress, and then learning from generation to generation what
works and what doesn't work, said Haas.
</P>
<P>
"So far, modeling of real human systems has not been really good," he said, "but
at SFI, there's the computer power to do it. We want to see how we can get a
whole lot of complexity through fairly simple agent-based rules. We're trying to
put humans into the system. We're just at the baby stages, but we're getting
close to figuring it out. I estimate a ten-year window for doing that."
</P>
<P>
If the modeling is successful, it could help researchers better understand how
choices are made as a population evolves in political and other forms of cultural
complexity. And it might help explain why the Pueblos in the northern Rio Grande
did not follow the path that has generally been taken by other peoples - a path
that would have led from small familial bands to tribes, then to confederacies,
and finally to some form of centralized statehood.
</P>
<P>
Although the tribes did act as a confederacy in the Pueblo Revolt, Haas noted
that the confederacy was formed to deal with an enormously unanticipated external
problem. "And as soon as the Spanish were gone, the confederacy fell apart." The
confederacy had not evolved, after all, as a way to address organizational
problems within Pueblo culture.
</P>
<P>
"The post-Revolt period was a time of tremendous conflict among the Pueblos
themselves," Haas said. "When the Spanish came back into the area, they reported
that many Pueblo people welcomed them, because it would bring an end to the
conflict that was ongoing."
</P>
<P>
From his own work and other studies, Haas now believes that the Pueblo
populations had been moving along several paths of political evolution, not just
one.
</P>
<P>
Some of the Pueblos in 1500 were big, powerful, and relatively isolated, like
Taos Pueblo (which has survived) and the pueblo at Pecos (which did not). They
had "always been off by themselves," he said, "and not always in good
relationships with their neighbors."
</P>
<P>
But in the Galisteo Basin, "it looks like there was much more of a confederacy
model," Haas said. That network of villages "was in a tight cluster, and we know
they spoke the same language, Tanoan, and they were moving around in that valley
in a coordinated way. They were united into something more than independent,
autonomous villages," Haas said.
</P>
<P>
"But no one model had emerged among the Pueblos as consistently better and
stronger or more competitive. There wasn't a single mode of organization - there
were multiple modes. Each one of these systems was an experiment. The Pueblos
were tinkering with political organization."
