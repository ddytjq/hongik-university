<p>Scientists have settled on the age of the earth of about 4.6 billion
years as a result of research started almost 50 years ago. This conclusion
was based upon carefully designed and conducted experiments that compared
the ratios in rock samples of parent elements to daughter elements ( some
of which would have been from radioactive decay of the parent, some of
which may have been present in the sample at the time of formation). Since
radioactive decay is known to occur at a constant rate, the age of a rock
can be determined from the ratio of the parent element to the daughter
element. The concerns about these dating methods were exactly the same
that creationists continue to raise - presence of the daughter element
at the time the rock was formed and possible loss / gain of either the
parent or daughter element at some point in the history of the rock. For
this reason, the tests were designed to account for those possibilities.
<p>Initial daughter element can often be accounted for by either measuring
the amount of an isotope of the daughter element (the ratio of isotopes
are almost always constant). Another possibility is (as in the case of
the potassium - argon - K-Ar method) that because the daughter element
is gaseous, it would escape from the rock when the rock was molten. Once
the rock cooled, the gaseous daughter would be trapped in the rocks crystal
structure and could no longer escape. By experimentation, scientists have
determined which rocks are suitable for various dating techniques. For
K-Ar, for example, igneous rocks are good candidates for testing because
they formed directly from molten magma and have a simple history. Metamorphic
rocks do not work well because heating events in their history have allowed
the escape of Argon (daughter element) and thus will indicate an age too
young for the sample. Sedimentary rocks do not work because they are made
up of a mixture of deposits of many other types of rocks, each of which
would point to a different age. At any rate, scientists have devoted a
great deal of effort to determining exactly which dating methods are appropriate
for which types of rocks.
<p>The other problem to avoid when dating rocks is the possibility that
changes to the rock have caused loss or gain of either the parent or daughter
element - this would lead to a false date (too old if parent element were
lost, too young if daughter element were lost). I know of two methods that
have been designed that can account for this possibility - isochron dating
and the uranium-thorium-lead discordia / concordia method (actually three
independent age calculations for one sample). Both of these methods have
internal checks for the possible loss / gain of elements to the rock.
<p>Creationists want the world to think that geologists just grab a rock
and throw any old radiometric test at it and poof - there's the age of
the rock. Reality is far more complex. If you examine the extensive research
in the field of geochronology, you will see that one of the most important
criteria in dating a sample lies in choosing an appropriate dating method
for the sample. From G. Brent Dalrymple (see below):
<p><b><i>One of the principal tasks of the geochronologist is to select
the type of the material used for a dating analysis. A great deal of effort
goes into the sample selection, and the choices are made before the analysis,
not on the basis of the results. Mistakes are sometimes made but are usually
caught by the various checks employed in the well-designed experiment.</i></b>
<p>The most compelling argument for an age of the earth of 4.5 billion
years are the large number of independent tests that have been used to
confirm this date. These tests have been performed on what are thought
to be the earth's oldest surviving rocks, meteorites, and moon rocks. These
tests have consistently given the same ages for each of these objects.

<p>These are the oldest of the rocks dated on the earth so far (as of 1997).
These are metamorphic rocks and thus have had some of their "history" lost
- metamorphosis fully or partially resets the radiometric ages of rocks
pointing to younger ages than the true age of the original rock. Older
rocks may have been lost due to erosion or have not yet been discovered.
<p>For many more examples of the consistancy of dating the same rocks with
multiple methods, see <a href="http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/jmeert/radiomet.htm">Consistent
Radiometric Dates</a> by Joe Meert, a Geologist at the University of Florida.
Dr. Meert's examples not only show that multiple radiometric methods come
up with consistent dates for samples from the same locations, but that
these results are also consistant with the paleomagnetic signature of the
rocks, the position where the rocks would be expected to be (due to continental
drift) at the time they were formed, and the cooling curves for the rocks.
(Cooling curves deal with the fact that the different radiometric isotopes
become "frozen" in the rocks at different temperatures. The higher the
closure temperature for an isotope, the older the rock will be as dated
by that isotope.) All of this consistancy rules out all of the arguments
creationists attempt to make against radiometric dating techniques.

<p>See <a href="http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/Bible-Science/Wiens.html">Radiometric
Dating A Christian Perspective</a> by Roger C. Wiens for more examples
of age of the earth and meteorite dates. The more I learn about radiometric
dating, the more I appreciate the quality of this article. It really offers
a complete, concise, and understandable explanation of radiometric dating
for the non-scientist.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>All of the above data are from G. Brent Dalrymple, <b><i>Radiometric
Dating, Geologic Time, and The Age of the Earth: A Reply to "Scientific"
Creationism</i></b> published by the U.S. Department of the Interior (Open-File
Report 86-110), 1986. This is an excellent report by a real scientist rebutting
the distortions that creation apologists have been putting out for 35 years.
It documents several examples of Henry Morris (the "Father of Creation
Science") and H.S. Slusher reaching invalid conclusions and quoting researchers
out of context. I strongly recommend that anyone interested in the scientific
vs. Genesis (fundamentalist interpretation) age of the earth controversy
read this paper. It should be available in most university libraries in
the U.S.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Creation "Science" Arguments Against Radiometric Dating</h3>
Now, what are the creationist arguments against radiometric dating? (See
my previous post on radiometric dating for details on how these techniques
work.) First, creationists have no data that determines the age of the
earth to be 6 - 10 thousand years old. Instead of trying to develop tests
to actually determine the earth's age (whatever it may be), creationists
are only interested in attempting to tear down the well founded results
of scientists (after 50 years of geochronological research alone) that
the earth is on the order of 4.5 billion years old. What have creationists
gotten for all of these years of work?
<p><a NAME="xenolith"></a>Well, the first popular technique of creationists
is to try to find examples of bad radiometric dates and offer these up
as proof that radiometric dating is totally unreliable. Henry Morris, in
his 1974 book "Scientific Creationism" made the claim that K/Ar dates for
lava from the 1801 Hulalalei volcano lava flow ranged from 160 million
years to 3 billion years old. With results like these, radiometric dating
must be totally useless - how could scientists possibly be so stupid as
to believe that radiometric dating could be of any merit when a simple
lava flow gives such a wide range of dates - right in their own research?
As usual with such claims, we'll have to dig a little further to get at
the truth. Morris cited a study by Funkhouser and Norton - <i>"Radiogenic
Helium and Argon in Ultramafic Inclusions from Hawaii"</i> published in
the Journal of Geophysics Research, vol. 73, pgs. 4601 - 4607. What Morris
didn't bother to inform his readers was that the study concerned <b>xenoliths</b>
- fragments of foreign rock broken of by the magmas intrusion through the
crust. Since they are not completely melted by the magma, they are in fact
much older than the lava flow (with K/Ar dating, what you are really dating
is how long it has been since the rock solidified from the molten state
- at this point the daughter Argon can no longer escape from the rock).
That particular study confirmed (as geologists already suspected) that
xenoliths could not be properly dated with the K/Ar method. The Funkhouser
and Norton study clearly stated that the "ages" determined by K/Ar dating
had no geological meaning and also determined that the xenoliths contained
excess argon trapped in "air" bubbles inside the rock. Of course there
was no mention of these details by Morris or any of the internet postings
I have seen that still list this "problem" - despite the fact that Dalrymple
answered it over 10 years ago. In the same paper, Dalrymple goes on to
describe in detail several other quotes taken out of context by creationists.
See <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-age-of-earth.html#failed">Reference
to a case where the given method did not work</a> by Chris Stassen and
<a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/dave_matson/young-earth/additional_topics/bad_dates.html">Woodmorappe's
Collection of Bad Dates</a> by for more examples of this popular creationist
technique.
<p>The second creationist technique is to provide supposed evidences of
a young age for the earth. These usually involve measuring the rate of
change of some (any) environmental phenomenon, assuming that the rate has
never changed, and calculating an age (always called an upper limit) for
the earth. These ages vary from 100 years (accumulation of aluminum in
the ocean) to 260 million years (accumulation of sodium in the ocean).
Examples include changes in the earth's magnetic field, accumulation of
helium in the atmosphere, and accumulation of metals in the ocean. The
problem with all of these methods is that they are too complex - no one
knows all of the sources or sinks (method of removal) for all of these
currently - and certainly in the past. Most of these techniques have been
examined in the scientific literature and found to be useless for determining
an age of the earth.
<p>Creationists make the claim that the earth's magnetic field has been
steadily decreasing over time. They claim that this trend indicates the
earth could not have supported life more than 20,000 years ago because
of the huge strength of the the earth's magnetic field. Besides making
the huge leap of faith that these trends (for which they have no explanation)
continued at the same rate into the distant past, they ignore the fact
that the decrease in the earth's dipole has been offset by an increase
in the non dipole component of the earth's magnetic field - leading to
a constant strength for the earth's magnetic field as measured over the
past 50 years. Paleomagnetic measurements have also shown that the earth's
dipole has fluctuated over the past 8000 years - not constantly decaying
as creationists claim. See the Dalrymple paper mentioned in my previous
post for more details. Also, see
<br><a href="http://www.nextek.com/stassen/ageearth.htm#magnetic">Decay
of the Earth's magnetic field</a>.
<br><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/origins/magfields">Creation "Science"
and Magnetic Fields</a>
<br><a href="http://www.users.fast.net/~lflank/magnetic.htm">CREATIONISTS
AND "MAGNETIC FIELD DECAY"</a>
<br>and <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/dave_matson/young-earth/specific_arguments/magnetic_field.html">Is
the Earth's Magnetic Field Decaying Exponentially?</a>
<br>for more problems with this disproven "theory".
<p>The next big "proof" for a young earth involves the accumulations of
various metal ions (including salt - the sodium of sodium chloride is a
metal ion when dissolved in water) dissolved in sea water. This claim ignores
the evidence that these ions are not accumulating in sea water - they are
at or near equilibrium in sea water. Although creationists want to talk
about sources of these ions, they don't want to talk about ways these ions
leave the ocean - precipitation, continental uplift. etc. See the following:
<br><a href="http://www.nextek.com/stassen/ageearth.htm#ocean">Problems
with "Dating" the Earth from Metal Influx Rates in the Ocean</a>.
<br>and <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/dave_matson/young-earth/specific_arguments/salt.html">How
Long Did it Take to Salt the Oceans?</a>.
<p>Another favorite claim of creationists is that the amount of Helium
in the earth's atmosphere indicates a young age for the earth. Once again,
they are quick to look at sources of Helium (radioactive decay) and ignore
or underestimate ways in which Helium escapes the earth's atmosphere. See:
<p><a href="http://www.nextek.com/stassen/ageearth.htm#helium">Accumulation
of Helium in the atmosphere</a>
<p>Finally, creationists like to claim that there has been no success in
dating historical volcanic flows. Well, here are a few examples for you
- the following eruptions were given zero ages from K/Ar dating. Zero is
exactly what you would expect from a radioisotope with a billion year half
life. I would suggest that you use an isotope with a shorter half life
- but, radioisotopes with a half life of 80 million years (or less) are
extremely rare in rocks (unless they are products of a longer lived parent)
- could this be because they all decayed to their daughter elements in
the earth's 4.5 billion history? See <a href="http://www.geocities.com/kenthovind/1proofs.html#6">Dave
Matson's article</a> on this topic for details.

<p>Note that all 3 of the above lavas contain xenolyths - foreign stones
that aren't part of the lava. These xenolyths contribute excess Argon to
the analysis leading to an older than expected date. Also note that while
these dating errors are significant for dating very recent rocks, an error
of 1 million years is insignificant in rocks older than say 50 to 100 million
years.
<p>All of the above was from Age of the Earth by G. Brent Dalrymple, pg.
132 - 134.
<p>The simple fact is, <b>Creationists have NO evidence that points to
a 6 - 10 thousand year age for the earth!</b> This belief is an article
of faith for creationists and they have never found any significant scientific
data to back it up. The best they can do is to try to find flaws in decades
of mainstream research (by thousands of researchers) that indicate the
effectiveness of radiometric dating and to try to come up with doubtful
scenarios that put an "upper limit" on the age of the earth. As was shown
above by multiple sources, these schemes do not work. To see just how bad
the ceationist model is , see <a href="http://www.csun.edu/~vcgeo005/wise.htm">Creationist
Geologic Time Scale: an attack strategy for the sciences</a> by Don Wise.
<p>Finally, I would like to raise the issue of motive in these questions
of
the age of the earth. Scientists have no reason to claim an age of the
earth of 4.5 billion years except for the results of decades of research
and thousands of tests by independent researchers indicating the effectiveness
of radiometric dating and that 4.5 billion years is the correct age of
the earth. They have no stake in this date - other than that the facts
support it. As the geochronologist Dalrymple said, <i>"I have no reason
whatsoever to want the age of the earth to be any more or less than it
happens to be. I would take great delight in proving that the earth is
only 10,000 years old if it were possible to do so."</i>
<p>Creationists, on the other hand , have an extreme interest in proving
the age of the earth to be 6 - 10 thousand years - it is required by their
fundamentalist (literal) Biblical theology. To them, the earth must have
been created in six literal days six thousand years ago. Any other possibility
is a violation of their deeply held religious beliefs. In fact, all of
the creation "science" organizations require members to adhere to clearly
religious "creeds" that require them to accept the authority of the Bible
in all matters. While this may be good religion, <b>it is very, very bad
science! </b>Can we really trust such people to make a fair and unbiased
attempt to determine the true age of the earth? We certainly haven't seen
any evidence of it so far.
