The field was packed withspectators and even though there were stands on both sides therewere so many people that it was hard for me to find a place to watchwhen I arrived in the middle of the first set. Sweden managed tostay close on the heels of Taiwan in this first set, but afterR.O.C. had "warmed up" I thought they just did not have a realchance. Taiwan won three sets in a row and received the gold medalfor the second time now.Between sets there were short freestyle demos but actually theR.O.C. team also did a good show during the game, e.g. with achoreographed disco-like dance which supposedly should fire up theplayers but definitely amused the crowd. Shortly before the prizeceremony started about 8 or 10 para gliders landed right next to thefield and after the ceremony the beach party started with livebands, bars, pizza and bungee jumping.Final standings Guts1. Taiwan2. Sweden3. Norway4. Japan5. Great Britain6.
