| Dear Dr. Schnieder,
| 
| Well I must say that it was after we labored over the graphic design of our
| Anaconda ad (and our web page) that we finalized the look and went to print
| that we discovered we had left handed DNA!  We hoped that no one would be
| observant enough to notice but alas that is clearly not the case.  
| 
| You may indeed place our not found in nature DNA on your web page.  Of
| course, blue and yellow anacondas are also not found in nature!
| 
| Should you ever need Gene Quantification services, or a terrific large
| scale plasmid DNA purification kit designed specifically for transfections
| and animal studies....give us a call at Althea!

| I did not use your image.  I was careful to point to the one at your web
| site.  That is, if you had clicked on the link you would have seen that the
| image resides at your web site.  It is possible for me to have the image
| appear on a web page the same way - so that I do not retain a copy - but I
| avoided that for two reasons.  First, it would appear to be from my files
| unless someone looked carefully.  Second, if you moved the image, it would
| break my link.  Therefore I prefer to keep copies of images in my own files.
| I always retain links to my sources.
| 
| To make this more clear to readers of my web page, I have changed the phrase
| "this image" to "their image number 59175".  I also changed the link to
| http://search.photodisc.com/viewcomp.asp?ss=DNA&mn=59175&rfr=br&iStartRow=1&x=39&y=43
| so that a person will see your web page rather than the image alone.

| I would like to use the image directly on my web page.  However, I am in the
| US government and do this as a kind of hobby (though it has led to some
| useful scientific connections and so is justifiable), so I'm not willing to
| pay for the image.  Note that by keeping the link you may get some business.
| 
| Perhaps I could post this image in exchange for having pointed out the

| discuss this matter with you in greater detail.
| 
| Due to the royalties that we pay our photographers and our legal agreements

| so in exchange for the information you provided us on the DNA image.

I initially didn't include it in this collection because

left handed DNA is also degraded by this process.
It has been suggested that this is related to the process
by which right handed DNA humans are being converted to left DNA handed humans.
However, the stronger hypothesis is that the left handed DNA humans
are not from earth, as indicated by

|      since there seem to be many contributions to the left hand world of

| 
| I believe that the current copyright conventions allow for fair review

| don't need our permission but feel free to have it anyway.
| 
| It's very hard to find artists, editors and designers who are medical
| experts which obviously explains why this error is so widespread. We do
| appear to be in good company as a lot of our clients appear to have made the
| same mistake judging by your web page.
| 
| I've passed your email on to our editorial department and they'll probably
| change the cover graphic to right handed DNA in due course. I've noted your
| comment on your site about the poor quality of the gif image used. This is
| because we used a 16 colour gif to reduce the file size and make the image
| download quicker. We can provide you with a 256 colour gif of the same image
| if you wish.
| 
| Good luck with your website and your quest for Left Handed DNA!

(<a href = "http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/284/5415/757">Science

we learn that reverse endrocrinology is now being done on Left handed
DNA containing
people.  The so-called "orphan nuclear receptors" are genes that look
like the receptor for a hormone, but no hormone has been identified yet.
Perhaps the problem is that the hormones are enantiomers (reverse handed)?

| Subject: Re: centromeres and sequence logos
| 
| It is indeed possible to establish exactly where the centromeres in S.
| cerevsiae lie from both genetic and biochemical evidence. We know that
| there is sequence information in these centromeres -giving rise to sequence
| specificity in DNA binding - but that cannot easily be discerned by
| inspection.  Thus, the application of your pattern matching approaches
| would be an excellent addition to the centromere literature.  I would be
| able to send you the sequence information should you wish to examine it.
| 
| I would also like to say that I find your web site, and the ridicule
| implicit in your inclusion of our figure, deeply offensive. Looking back, I
| realize that at we flipped a figure around the vertical axis to make a more
| compact multi-panel figure during final revisions.  Doing this in
| Illustrator turns a right handed helix into a left handed one.
| 
| Looking at your examples, I would bet that most are proofing/layout errors
| made during the final stages of printing, or errors like our made in the
| heat of revisions.  To point these errors out is a service, to ridicule
| them uncollegial.
| 
| We will ask JCB to print a correction of our figure.  I trust that you will
| then remove the incorrect version from your web site.

| 
| Dear Dr. Deerfield:
| 
| This message is just to alert you to a situation concerning your work.
| 
| As a small hobby and public service, I maintain a web page devoted to listing
| cases of inadvertant left handed DNA images:
| 
| http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/LeftHanded.DNA.html
| 
| As you will see this is surprisingly wide spread.
| 
| Recently I found out that a Fisher Scientific catalogue cover had a left
| handed DNA.  Today I found out that you produced the image, but when I went
| to your web site I found that all of your images are right handed.  I have
| asked permission from Fisher to include a copy of their cover, and I have put
| pointers to your web site.  Apparently the image got inverted somewhere in
| the cover-preparation process.
| 
| The entry is number 48.
| 
| May I have your permission to include the Fisher cover on the page?
| 
| If you know that you sent them a right handed image, I can mention that in
| the entry.
| 
| Regards,
| 
| Tom

| Hmm.  I'm not sure what you mean by this.  I looked on the back side of the
| cover (which I hadn't looked at before) and found that it was just labeled
| "DNA", with no notation that it is left handed.
| 
| I found the web site of Dr. Deerfield, who made the pictures,

| and see that all the DNAs there are correct (ie, right handed).

The front cover of the
<a href = "http://www.daigger.com">
Summer 1999 Life Science Edition catalogue from <b>Daigger</b></a>
announces
"DNA Daigger's New Attractions".
Jack Tessman points out that
<blockquote>
"There is a DNA helix in the upper, outer corner of every one of the
catalog's 28 pages.  Except for the cover (page 1) which shows [two] right-
handed DNAs, all the odd pages show left-handed DNA.  The even pages show
right-handed DNA.  In addition, sprinkled throughout are little men in
lab coats that partially cover skeletal [DNA] structures which are right-
handed wherever the little man is holding a pointer in his left hand,
and left-handed wherever the little man is holding a pointer in his
right hand."
</blockquote>
I note also that the button on the man's lab coat
switches sides depending on which hand holds the pointer.
If I recall correctly, men's clothing (and the lab coats we have
in the lab here) have the button on the right side when unclosed.
This corresponds to the right handed DNA pictures.
So we might infer that the original artist drew the image the "right"
way, and it was flipped for publication.

In the first 200 pages of GENES VI (Benjamin  Lewin, Oxford Press, 1997),
diagrams of left-handed DNA are found in the following  figures.
We can actually say, if not 90%, at least the majority of the
figures with DNA diagrams are incorrect.

Figs.  3.14; 4.16; 4.20; 4.21; 4.23; 5.2; 5.3; 5.4 (an interesting hairpin

| Dear Dr. Schneider:
| 
| Thank you for your interest on our logo.
| An artist designed that logo, so we are not sure if that "left-handed"
| helix was meant to be taken as DNA.
| 
| In any case, we DDBJ are happy to join your list.  I visited that, and it
| was fascinating!

I can't include it because it still *could* be right handed.
Better to err on the side of correctness.

For your first visit to the
<a href = "http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/LeftHanded.DNA.html">Left Handed
Hall of Fame</a>
 page I suggest that you follow the story
over <a href = Leftwhole.html>all of the years</a>.
After that you can look at each year individually
from the table below.
Note:  just because a year has gone by does not mean
we haven't found more examples for that year!
</p>

<IMG SRC="icons/animouse.gif" ALIGN = "LEFT"></a>
<h1>1997 and 1998 were bumper crop years<br>
and 1999 beat them more than 2 fold.
2000 was a record year, thanks to help from
friends around the world
(60 of the 97 cases, 63%!).
2001 will exceed even that record!
