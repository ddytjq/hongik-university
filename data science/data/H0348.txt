</i></b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The discovery of
the fossil bird,</b><b><i> Archaeopteryx</i></b><b>, initiated a
debate on the origin of birds and of their capacity of flight.
Early considerations led to two opposite theories: The theory on
the tree-dwelling bird-ancestors, </b><b><i>the arboreal theory</i></b><b>,
and the theory on the ground-running bird-ancestors, </b><b><i>the
cursorial theory</i></b><b>.<br>

<p><a name="A11"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>1.</b></font></a><font
face="Times New Roman"><b> The arboreal theory.<br>
</b>As most other vertebrates which possess some airborne way of
locomotion are tree-dwellers, it was the earliest unreflected
assumptions (Marsh, 1881) that birds owe their flying ability to
tree-climbing ancestors. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Pycraft (1894) called the
attention to the resemblance between the clawed forelimbs of the
climbing chick of the hoazin (<i>Opistocomus</i>) and the
forelimbs of <i>Archaeopteryx</i>. From this he concluded that
the birds descended from some arboreal, i.e. tree-dwelling,
fourlegged reptiles. These reptiles, which he called
&quot;proavis&quot;, he considered to have evolved the ability of
flight by jumping in trees.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The arboreal theory was supported
by Abel (1911) who in the reversed 1st toe of <i>Archaeopteryx</i>
saw the evidence of the tree-climbing origin of the birds. He
proposed that the bird-ancestors leaped in branched trees and
gradually evolved wings and flapping fligh through stages of
parachuting and gliding.</font></p>

<p><a name="A12"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>2</b></font></a><font
face="Times New Roman"><b>. The cursorial theory.<br>
</b>Due to the striking similarity of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> to
bipedal dinosaurs, Williston (1879) pointed at some terrestrial
reptile as bird- ancestor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The theory of the tree-climbing
origin of the birds was opposed by Nopcsa (1907, 1923, 1929). He
argued that the general shape of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> with its
long neck and tail and its long-legged bipedality was
inconsistent with an arboreal way of life. He also considered the
forelimbs of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> to have been unfit for grasping
twigs and concluded that its ancestors were ground-living -
cursorial - theropod-like reptiles which evolved the flying
ability by running on the ground, waving their forelimbs.</font></p>

<p><a name="A13"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>3</b></font></a><font
face="Times New Roman"><b>. Heilmann.<br>
</b>By his famous book, &quot;The Origin of Birds&quot;, Heilmann
(1926) for a long period settled the controversy by proposing the
arboreal behaviour of a bipedal ancestor of <i>Archaeopteryx</i>
and birds to be the origin of flight.</font></p>

        <td width="85%"><font size="2" face="Arial">Considering
        the appreciation of &quot;The Origin of Birds&quot;, it
        is astonishing that Heilmann was a Danish artist, and as
        an artist he wrote this book. </font><p><font size="2"
        face="Arial">Gerhard Heilmann was born in 1859 and had
        studied technology and medicine, but gave up these
        studies to be an artist. For many years he was an
        estimated landscapepainter and illustrator of books, and
        achieved international reputation as a decorator of
        Danish china. Among other things he designed Danish
        banknotes. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">He was 67 years old when
        &quot;<i>The Origin of Birds&quot;</i> was published, and
        in the following years he wrote and illustrated books on
        birds. In 1940 he published a book &quot;<i>Universet og
        Traditionen&quot;,</i><b> </b>which is an account on
        evolution and the origin of universe, opposed to the
        traditional accounts. As this sharp-witted book was
        little understood, he wrote - some eighty years old! -
        another book on the same subject. In this book, which was
        published posthumously, he emphasized that he did not
        attach religious feelings, but the Church which he
        considered based on ignorance and stupidity.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Previously, 1912 - 1916,
        Heilmann had published some articles in <i>Dansk
        Ornitologisk Forenings Tidsskrift: &quot;Vor nuværende
        Viden om Fuglenes Afstamning</i><b>&quot;</b> (i.e.
        &quot;<i>Our Present Knowledge of the Descent of Birds</i>&quot;)
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Writing these articles he
        was inclined to adopt the cursorial theory and
        corresponded with Nopcsa on the matter. But as he could
        not accept Nopcsa's idea on how a ground-living proavis
        evolved feathers and capacity of flight, he persuaded
        himself to the arboreal theory proposed by Abel (1911).
        See fig. 1.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Heilmann's ideas are not
        original. The pseudosuchian origin of birds was forwarded
        by Broom (1913) and the argumentation of the arboreal
        proavis was proposed by Abel (1912). But Heilmann did not
        have &quot;scientific&quot; ambitions; his articles and
        books were meant to present what he considered the truth,
        not to be &quot;science&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Heilmann died in 1946.<br>

        magnificent reconstruction of a pair of fighting male
        proavis. But as he could not explain how ground-living
        proavis might have evolved the wings, he added the

face="Times New Roman"><b>Later theories.<br>
</b>Heilmann's theory was generally accepted, but then the
cursorial theory was revived and various proposals were forwarded
in its favour.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Modern supporters of the arboreal
theory, (e.g. Bock, 1965 and subsequent papers; Feduccia, 1980;
Norberg, 1985) seem to join Heilmann's (1926) proposal that the
performance of flapping flight evolved as a subsequent evolution
of an original gliding flight between trees.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Norberg (1985 a, b.) has
demonstrated that a subsequent evolution of gliding into flapping
flight for aerodynamic reasons is not improbable. But as she
herself remarks, one thing is that the evolution of flapping
subsequent to gliding is aerodynamically possible, another thing
is whether it actually happened!</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Nopcsa (1907) proposed that a
ground-living proavis evolved the forelimb flapping in order to
&quot;oar along in the air&quot;, an idea in which he seems to
have persisted (1923, 1929) and modern supporters of the
cursorial origin of avian flight have proposed other pre-bird
kinds of behaviour, e.g. that pre-wings evolved for catching
insects, (Ostrom, 1974), for balancing (Peters &amp; Guttman,
1976), for scaring of predators (Harrison, 1976), for jumping to
catch insects (Caple, Balda &amp; Willis, 1983), for jumping
across cleffs (Peters, 1984), or for shading (Thulborne &amp;
Hamlyn, 1985).<br>
Non of these proposals seems, however, convincingly to explain
the origin of flapping flight.<br>

face="Arial"><b><i> The problem.<br>
</i></b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The origin of
flight is a puzzle in relation to the evolutionary principles of
a gradual, step by step, development, each step the more adaptive
than previous steps. </b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is a generally accepted
principle of evolution that any evolutionary step served an
adaptive purpose more advantageous than the previous stages.</font>(Darwin,
1859)<a href="oricom.htm#note1"><font color="#FF0000"><sup>1</sup></font></a>)<font
face="Times New Roman"><br>
According to this it can be understood that bird-ancestors which
were able to perform <i>some</i> small degree of airborne
locomotion might gradually have improved this ability into real
flight.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">But it is hard to understand how
wings and ability to fly possibly might have evolved gradually in
pre-birds with no previous ability to accomplich any kind of
aerial locomotion.<br>
If wings evolved by degree, it is also hard to understand what
adaptive purpose undeveloped wings might have served, and how a
habit of flapping unwinged forelimbs might have been more
advantageous than a previous habit of not doing so!</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It can be imagined that
pre-birds, if they lived aloft in trees, might have evolved some
device for parachuting and subsequently for gliding. But why they
eventually replaced this simple manner of airborne locomotion by
the complicated and energically expensive flapping flight, is far
from obvious.<br>
And how a bipedal, long-legged <i>Archaeopteryx</i>-like
bird-ancestor with laterally flexed wrists and a long, stiff tail
possibly have might have been a tree-dweller is really a puzzle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">On the other hand: For which
purpose might ground-living, bipedal bird-ancestors possibly have
evolved wings and an ability of flight?</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>The only logical answer to
these questions is that the bird-ancestors were not really
tree-dwellers and that they evolved the requisitets of flight as
an adaptation to a non-aerial manner of life.</i></font></p>

<p><a name="A30"><font face="Arial"><b><i>3</i></b></font></a><font
face="Arial"><b><i>. The prerequisites of flapping flight.<br>
</i></b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Before the
bird-ancestors initiated the evolution of flight capacity, they
must for non-aerial purpose have possessed the necessary
anatomical, behavioral and aerodynamic preconditions
-&quot;prerequisites&quot;. </b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to initiate any kind of
flight the bird-ancestors previously must have acquired the
following prerequisites which they must have inherited from early
reptilian ancestors or they must have evolved them at an
intermediate stage as adaptive for a non-flying manner of life:</font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The anatomical
        prerequisites</b>, i.e. a pectoral skeleton and a
        pectoral musculature necessary for projecting the
        forelimbs laterally and eventually for moving them in up-
        and down-swings.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The behavioral
        prerequisites</b>, i.e. the habit to project the forlimbs
        and to move them simultaneously in a flapping manner.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The aerodynamic
        prerequisites</b>, i.e. a device, suitable for
        aerodynamic purpose, patagium or proto-remiges.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The question on how these
prerequisites were acquired by non-flying pre-birds cannot, of
course, be answered by any kind of prima facie evidence as no
fossil hardly ever can show how the bird-ancestors actually lived
or how they evolved the flying capacity.<br>
A reasonable manner in which to answer the question is by setting
up a realistic model of thought, a comprehensive theory, which is
based consistently on known facts and recognized principles of
evolution.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The validity of such a
comprehensive theory depends on its ability parsimoneously to
explain not even the origin of the prerequisites mentioned. It
should also serve as an useful part of a parsimoneous explanation
of the origin of other characteristic traits which constitute the
birds as a particular class of vertebrates.</font></p>

such a comprehensive theory on the origin of the class of birds. </i></font></p>
