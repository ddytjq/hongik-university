    In their continuing campaign to save their football club, the Chester City Independent
    Supporters Association are to lobby the Chairman of the Football League and the Minister
    of Sport in London next week (Wednesday 11th November). The ISA is to temporarily switch
    from campaigning locally, to raise the profile of the Club on a national scale. They are
    also to raise the plight of a number of the other 71 members of the family of the Football
    League who are experiencing similar difficulties. </p>
    <p>ISA Spokesman Michael Fair said &quot; The situation we currently find ourselves in
    here at Chester City is not unique. We are probably sitting at the top of an ever- growing
    pyramid of Clubs. The Football League need to be doing more to address the problems faced
    by its Members. The game is awash with money what with TV royalties and other sponsorship
    deals, and we do not consider enough of that money is percolating down to the grass roots.
    The Football League say they are concerned for each of the 72 members of their
    &quot;family&quot; well if they do not act soon there will be a death in the family and we
    all know how distressing that can be. They also need to ensure that it is not the start of
    an epidemic.</p>
    <p>&quot;Clearly the Football League cannot be held responsible for the failings of
    individual Clubs who are in effect Limited Companies and we fully recognise this. But they
    do have a moral obligation to the fans of those Clubs and the image of our sport
    generally, to ensure that the Clubs conduct themselves in a proper manner. The
    introduction of stricter regulations on conduct of the business operations of Clubs would
    be most welcome.&quot;</p>
    <p>Members of the ISA will be taking with them to the Football League a petition signed by
    nearly 5000 people indicating their support for Chester City FC. This is a direct response
    to Football League Chairman Richard Scudamores' question posed at a recent forum &quot;Do
    the people of Chester want a football club?&quot;</font></td>
