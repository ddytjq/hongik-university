<h1>Organization, Caveats, and Editor's Notes</h1>
I organized the information in what I consider coherent packets.  The
fact that I can link between pages makes this much easier than writing a
standard report.  However, that interconnectedness makes it tricky for me
to be sure that all links are proper, and all information makes sense.  To
that end I must say that I kept all the quirks about the sigularity itself
to the Inside 'em section. I mention the three types of black holes in
increasing complexity of material. Each one builds on the previous ones in
the sense that basic stuff is mentioned first in depth and then at
minimum. Why?  I assumed that you're either reading through each type and
therefore are introduced to the basic stuff or you've skipped around
because you already know a fair bit about black holes.
<p>
The gravity bit (or A Caveat about Jillian's Writing):<br>
I can be less accurate in what I write when I want to get a point across.
I'll set the record straight. Gravity doesn't "do" anything. Gravity is an
effect, just like something emitting EM waves in the visible spectrum
generates the effect we call light.  Matter happens to generate it.  There
are phrases like 'force of gravity' and 'acceleration due to gravity,' but
those are just english phrases to describe this <i>thing</i> that changes
the behavior of anything with matter or energy traveling through 
spacetime. As explained by the spacetime model, gravity is entirely the
bending of that spacetime; it's warpage, and light and rockets follow the
path of that warpage (unless the rocket does something about it like
firing its engines).  Three-dimensional humans look around and say 'force
of gravity' and relativity says 'effect of bent spacetime.'
<p>
Look, the things I say about light cones aren't ... entirely correct. When
I get the chance, I'll fix it to give you a run down of light cones for
inertial observers and accelerating observers. That whole bit about the
universe condensing to a dot or to a circle depends on which observer you
are. So I'm a lazy bum and haven't made the changes, yet. I will get to
them. When I get time.
<p>
I have made all possible efforts to give credit where credit's due.  Some
of these pictures are mine and only the product of my imagination and
Photoshop, but not all these pictures are mine.  In each case I've made a
link near the picture and explained where I found it.  If, however, you
find a picture that should have a reference cuz it's not mine,
<a href="mailto:gothos9@juno.com"><i>tell</i>
me (gothos9@juno.com)</a> and I'll be happy to change it. That's
not the only reason you could email me. People like to leave a note saying
they've stopped by---and I love it! C'mon, don't be shy. Comments,
complaints, compliments, and corrections are all welcome in my inbox. I
now have a <a
href="http://www.dragonweave.com/gothos/guestbook/guestbook.html">guestbook</a>,
too, so feel free to leave comments there.
<p>
I offer apologies to those viewers using UNIX machines. For some reason my
font color appears quite dark on those monitors (or perhaps it's just
that my screen makes things seem much lighter). I've lightened the color
as much as I'm willing to; I'm sorry if it's still too dark. This was my
final project for <a href="http://suhep.phy.syr.edu/courses/PHY312/">PHY
312</a> at <a href="http://www.syr.edu">Syracuse University</a>.
Amazingly, the <a href="http://www.go.com">GO Network</a> selected it for
a Science Award. I was impressed. They even gave me a nice image to
display, but I'm having trouble unencoding it at the moment.
<p>
That having been said, enjoy the show!
