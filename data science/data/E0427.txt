                        in C since 1985, C++ since 1996 and assembler since sometime 
                        in the dark distant past, mostly on Microsoft Operating 
                        Systems. Stephen has used every version of Watcom C/C++ 
                        since 1987 (version 7.0), and has also used just about 
                        every version of Microsoft C, C++ BASIC compilers since 
                        1984. Stephen has been a member of TeamSybase, the official 
                        Sybase support team for the Sybase News Server since 1996, 
                        supporting Watcom C/C++ and more recently Watcom Fortran. 
                        Stephen has good knowledge on 16 and 32-bit DOS, 16 and 
                        32-bit Windows and as part of he Open Watcom group expects 
                        to be looking at the C, C++ and Fortran compilers as well 
                        as WASM and the C, C++ and Fortran runtime libraries. 
                        Stephen maintains good relationships with the original 
                        developers of the Watcom compilers in Waterloo. You can

                        <b>Craig Eisler - Closet Developer:</b> Craig is now a 
                        closet developer as he has taken on a CEO role at Action 
                        Engine (<A 
              href="http://www.actionengine.com">http://www.actionengine.com</A>). 
                        He worked at Watcom from 1989 to 1993, on versions 8.0 
                        through 9.5. He was reponsible for developing the Windows 
                        extender (win386), the editor, the win16/win32/win386/os2 
                        2 debuggers, the win16/win32 runtime libraries and various 
                        and sundry other things before moving to Microsoft in 
                        1993. While at Microsoft, Craig was the founding developer 
                        for the DirectX project, and left in January of 2000 after 
                        spending almost 2 years as the General Manager of the 
                        Windows Media Platform group. Craig is still in Redmond, 
                        WA, having a blast doing the startup thing, and among 
                        other things is doing programming for the Palm OS where 
                        his 16 bit, low memory, slow processor experience is finally 
                        paying off. After all this time, Craig still secretly 
                        wishes he was playing poker with his Watcom buddies again.
