<h3> Abstract </h3>
</center>

A hypothesis for the origin of introns in eukaryotic genes is
      developed. By computer simulation it was found that the
      reading-frame lengths in a random nucleotide sequence are
      distributed in a negative exponential manner and that there exists
      an upper limit of about 200 codons in the length of the reading
      frames (RFs). These characteristics suggest that, if primordial DNA
      contained a random nucleotide sequence, the most primitive cells
      would have been under selective pressure to eliminate interfering
      stop codons in order to increase the length of RFs. Further, they
      indicate that the only possible way that a coding sequence that is
      considerably longer than 600 nucleotides could be derived from the
      short coding sequences occurring in a random sequence would be to
      splice the short coding sequences and to eliminate the stretches of
      sequences containing clusters of inframe stop codons. Thus, introns
      are suggested to be those stretches of sequences containing
      interfering stop codons that were originally earmarked in the first
      primitive cells to be eliminated in order to enable the coding for
      long polypeptides. Because the statistical characteristics of codon
      distributions in today's eukaryotic DNA sequences resemble closely
      those of a random sequence and because the upper limit in the length
      of RFs (200 codons) in a random sequence corresponds precisely to
      the observed maximum length of exons in today's eukaryotic genes
      (600 nucleotides), it is suggested that introns originated in the
      most primitive unicellular eukaryotes when they evolved from
      primordial sequences. The data from the prokaryotic gene sequences
      indicate that prokaryotic genes may have been derived originally
      from primitive unicellular eukaryotic genes by losing introns from
      them.
