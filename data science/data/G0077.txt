<a href="#cat">&gt;&gt; Catalog Start</a> ..
<p>

<a href="biograph.html">Charles Messier</a> published his catalog in three steps: 
<ul>
<li>the first edition appeared in the "<i>M&eacute;moires de l'Academie</i>"
  for 1771 (published 1774) and covered the objects 
  <a href="#M1">M1</a>--<a href="#M45">M45</a>.
  Also in 1774, it was printed in Lalande's <i>Ephemerides</i> for 1775-84
  (according to Owen Gingerich).
<li>the first supplement (to <a href="#M68">M68</a>) was published
  in the "<i>Connaissance des Temps</i>" for 1783 (published 1780), together
  with a reprint of the first catalog edition. The discovery announce of the
  objects   <a href="#M69">M69</a> and <a href="#M70">M70</a> 
  was added in a separate contribution to the end of the same volume.
  Messier provided an <a href="m-cat-i.html">introduction to his catalog</a>,
  and following the catalog, a list was printed of <a href="notfound.html">
  objects reported by previous observers but not verified by Messier</a>
  when he had looked for them, and <a href="lacaille.html">Lacaille's 
  <i>Catalog of Nebulae of the Southern Sky</i></a>.
  (We have this <a href="lac-cat.html">reprint version of Lacaille's catalog</a>
  online, which contains remarks by Messier)
<li>the final published version of the catalog appeared in the
  "<i>Connaissance des Temps</i>" for 1784 (published 1781), containing the 
  objects up to <a href="#M103">M103</a>. Again, the 
  <a href="m-cat-i.html">introduction</a> and the <a href="notfound.html">
  list of failed object observations</a> was printed after the catalog, 
  followed by <a href="lacaille.html">Lacaille's 
  <i>Catalog of Nebulae of the Southern Sky</i></a>.
  This version of the catalog was reprinted unchanged in the 
  <i>"Connaissance des Temps"</i> for 1787 (published 1784) together with 
  all its appendices.
</ul>

Messier never published a further upgrade, although he has expressed plans to do 
so, e.g. in the "<i>Connaissance des Temps</i>" for 1801. However, he made 
extensive use of his personal copy of the catalog, adding the missing two 
positions for <a href="#M102">M102</a> and <a href="#M103">M103</a>, and the 
new entry <a href="#M104">M104</a> as well as positions for two objects
mentioned with <a href="#M97">M97</a> (they were later assigned
<a href="#M108">M108</a> and <a href="#M109">M109</a>).
Other <a href="../../addition.html">additional objects</a> have been added
<a href="pm-lett.html">from a letter</a> by 
<a href="pmechain.html">Pierre M&eacute;chain</a> (who had probably planned 
to include them in a later revision which never occurred) and a publication 
by Messier.
<p>
Thanks to the help of <a href="http://www.astronexus.com/">Dave Nash</a>, 
we can present here a <a href="mcathist.html">History of the Messier Catalog</a>.
<p>
Here, Messier's final catalog version is presented, with the 
<a href="../../addition.html">additional objects</a> attached, and some 
comments where appropriate (in the opinion of the present author),
e.g. explaining reasons and the circumstances of identification of the 4 once
<a href="../../missing.html">missing Messier objects</a>.
Many of the English translations were initially leaned to those of 
<b>Kenneth Glyn Jones</b>, published in his book 
<i>Messier's Nebulae and Star Clusters</i>,
some more to those by <b>Owen Gingerich</b> from his 
<i>Sky &amp; Telescope</i> articles which are reprinted in 
Mallas &amp; Kreimer's <i>Messier Album</i>.
This book also served as a source for the French version, which is reprinted 
there in facsimile.
<p>
Moreover, the present author [hf] was lucky to obtain a photo copy of Messier's 
personal copy of the catalog, including some of his personal notes on his 
original observations and discoveries of nebulae and star clusters, which is 
part of the <i>Bibliotheque de Camille Flammarion</i>.
<b>Camille Flammarion</b> was lucky to find this booklet at an antique book 
store, <a href="fl-m-cat.html">see [a translation of] his report</a>.
This copy was generously provided by Dr. <b>Donald J. Greeley</b>, who had 
obtained it himself from <b>Adoin Dollfus</b>.  It as served, and still serves,
as source for revisions and improvements of the translations, and as source for 
further comments.
<p>
We also have a translation of 
<a href="m-cat-i.html">Messier's introduction to his catalog</a> online.
<p>
Note our list of <a href="m-pos.html">Messier's original object positions</a>
compared to modern values.
<p>
Some original translations from Messier's personal copies and observing notes 
related to the Messier Catalogue [more under work]:
<ul>
<li><a href="m-cat-or.html">Messier's Object List by Right Ascension</a>,
  created by Charles Messier probably between August 31 and October 4, 1780.
</ul>
Messier's catalog was an important milestone in the 
<a href="deepskyd.html">history of deepsky discovery</a>.
The 110 objects collected in the version presented here and in our
<a href="../../Messier.html">Messier Catalog database</a> represent the lot of 
deepsky objects visible from northern latitudes (Paris) and discovered before 
<a href="../similar/herschel.html">William Herschel</a>'s comprehensive scan 
of the northern sky with large instruments.
The objects have been discovered and independently rediscovered by a 
considerable number of astronomers, look at our
<a href="dis-stat.html">Discovery Statistics</a>.

  `Nebula in the great Bear [Ursa Major], near Beta: 
  It is difficulat to see, reports M. M&eacute;chain, especially when one
  illuminates the micrometer wires: its light is faint, without a star.
  M. M&eacute;chain saw it the first time on Feb 16, 1781, &amp; the position 
  is that given by him. Near this nebula he has seen another one, [the 
  position of] which has not yet been determined [<a href="#M108">M108</a>], 
  and also a third which is near Gamma of the Great Bear
  [<a href="#M109">M109</a> near Gamma Ursae Majoris].'

  well with an existing object, <a href="../../m/ngc5866.html">NGC 5866</a>,
  as does Messier's position measurement, if one takes an error of exactly
  5 degrees in right ascension into account. This issue was ever since,

  `On May 11, 1781, I discovered a nebula above the Raven [Corvus] which did
  not appear to me to contain any single star. It is of a faint light and
  difficult to find if the micrometer wires are illuminated. I have compared
  it [its position] on this day and the following with Spica in the Virgin
  and from this derived its right ascension 187d 9' 42" and its southern 
  declination 10d 24' 49" [the same position as in Messier's handwritten note].
  It does not appear in the <i>Connaissance des Temps</i>.'
  <p>
  (<i>Flammarion:</i> 
  `It has the position of the nebula H I.43 found by Wm. Herschel, and is No. 
  4594 of the NGC of Dreyer.  We can add it to Messier's catalogue and give 
  it the number 104. The result is that Messier's catalogue from now on is 
  reckoned as numbering 104 instead of 103.')

  which I have discovered in the Lion [Leo; <a href="#M95">M95</a> and 
  <a href="#M96">M96</a>]. I find nothing to correct for the given positions
  which I have determined by comparison of their situation with respect to
  Regulus. There is, however, a third one, somewhat more northerly, which is
  even more vivid [brighter] than the two preceding ones [M95 and M96].
  I discovered this one on March 24, 1781, 4 or 5 days after I had found the
  other two. On April 10, I compared its situation with Gamma Leonis from
  which followed its right ascension 159d 3' 45" and its northern declination
  of 13d 43' 58".'
