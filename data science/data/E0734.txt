<H3>
Q: Add version info to a BCB project
</H3>
<BR>
<H3>Answer</H3>
<P>
C++Builder 3.0 and above provide built in support for adding version information for your BCB program.
This support can be found on the Version tab of the Project-Options dialog box. In C++Builder 1.0, you
must add an <TT>RC</TT> resource file to your project if you want to include version information. This
FAQ applies to BCB 1.0 users, and to users of BCB3, BCB4, and BCB5 who want more flexibility than what
is provided by theversion settings in the project options. Most programmers can just use the settings
in the project options.
</P>
<P>
Select File | New... from the BCB menu and select the Text object
in the object repository. If you don't have an object repository (Standard
edition of BCB), create the file using Notepad or some other editor. Save the
file as <TT>VERSION.RC</TT>. Insert the following text into the file, and add
the file to your project by selecting the Project | Add To Project menu option.
</P>

<P>
<B>Note 1:</B> You can use the resource editor from Borland C++ 5, MSVC++ 4.X or 5,
or any other Windows compiler to create the version resource for you instead of creating the
RC file manually with a text editor. Create the resource, save it to an <TT>RC</TT> file, and then add it to your BCB project.
</P>
<P>
<B>Note 2:</B> The number 1 before the <TT>VERSIONINFO</TT> keyword is the
resource ID of of the version resource. Sometimes you might see a resource
identifier, such as <TT>VS_VERSION_INFO</TT>, in place of the number 1. In this
case, <TT>VS_VERSION_INFO</TT> would be defined in a header or make file. However,
Windows requires that this ID be set to 1. To save time and trouble, I prefer to
literally place the value 1 right in the resource. You can use whichever
strategy you prefer.
</P>
<P>
<B>Note 3:</B> The lines that follow the <TT>VERSIONINFO</TT> keyword are called
the fixed-info block of the version resource. The fixed-info block ends with the
first <TT>BEGIN</TT> statement. The fixed-info block is important, but it will
not normally be seen by users.  The table below explains each statement in the
fixed-info block:

Item               Description                                 Examples
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILEVERSION        The version number of the file.             1,0,0,200
PRODUCTVERSION     The version number of the product.          1,0,0,0
FILEFLAGSMASK      Always set to 0x3fL                         0x3fL
FILEFLAGS          Allows you to mark the app as debug,        0
                   or pre-release software. Some valid         VS_FF_DEBUG
                   values (see winver.h for more choices):
                      0x0L             :normal flag
                      VS_FF_DEBUG      :contains debug info
                      VS_FF_PATCHED    :has been patched
                      VS_FF_PRERELEASE :still in beta
FILEOS             Describes the target OS for the app.        VOS_WINDOWS32
                   Some values (see winver.h):
                      VOS_DOS
                      VOS_NT

                      VOS_WINDOWS32
FILETYPE           Identifies the file as an app, dll,         VFT_APP
                   or driver
                      VFT_APP  :application.
                      VFT_DLL  :dynamic link library
                      VFT_DRV  :device driver
                      VFT_VXD  :virtal device driver
FILESUBTYPE        Subtype is only used when FILETYPE is       0x0L
                   a font or a driver. Set to 0 normally
</PRE>
<P>
<B>Note 4:</B> So what's the difference between the <TT>FILEVERSION</TT> and the
<TT>PRODUCTVERSION</TT>? I'll use BCB to explain. C++Builder shipped with
version <TT>2.05</TT> of <TT>WinSight</TT>. If you were designing a version
resource for WinSight, you might set the <TT>FILEVERSION</TT> to <TT>2,0,5,0</TT>
because WinSight's version is 2.05, but <TT>PRODUCTVERSION</TT> would be <TT>1,0,0,0</TT>
because <TT>WinSight</TT> is part of the C++Builder package, and BCB is version
1.00 (if you have BCB3, then adjust the numbers accordingly).
</P>
<P> The meaning of the <TT>FILEVERSION</TT> and <TT>PRODUCTVERSION</TT> is up to
you. In general, let's say that your program is on version 2.1.10. You might set
the <TT>FILEVERSION</TT> to <TT>2,1,10,0</TT>. Some companies keep track of build
numbers (Microsoft does this a lot). You could stick this in the last item.
Imagine your program is on build number 738. You could use <TT>2,1,10,738</TT>
as your <TT>FILEVERSION</TT>. The choice is up to you. Here are what some of the
programs on my PC use in their version resources.
</P>

Product                FILEVERSIONINFO       Help About
--------------------------------------------------------
Internet Explorer 4    4, 71, 1712,    0     4.71.1712.6
MS Dev Studio          5,  0,    0, 7022
MS Spy program         4,  0,    0,    0     5.00.7022
MS rc.exe              5,  0, 1472,    1
MS word                8,  0,    0, 3514
MS outlook             8,  2,    1, 4106     8.02.4212
</PRE>
<P>
Notice that Microsoft gets a little careless. It looks like somebody forget to
alter the version resource for the Spy program. Outlook's version resource contains
a 1 that never appears in the help about screen. Plus, look at how those big
numbers move around. I assume these big numbers are the build numbers, but
Microsoft puts them in different locations for different products.
</P>
<P>
<B>Note 5:</B> The version resource contains two blocks of data between the first
<TT>BEGIN</TT> and the very last <TT>END</TT>. One block is called the
<I>Variable Information Block</I>,
and the other is called the <I>String Information Block</I>. The var info block is
marked by the line <TT>BLOCK "VarFileInfo"</TT>. The var info block contains a value
that is labelled <TT>"Translation"</TT>. The translation value contains two
numbers that dennote which languages and character sets your product supports.
The first number (<TT>0x409</TT> in the example) determines which language the
program supports. <TT>0x409</TT> is the code for US English. The second value
(<TT>1200</TT> in the example) describes the character set. <TT>1200</TT> is the
value for the <TT>UNICODE</TT> set. Other common values are <TT>1252</TT> for
Windows Multilingual (word uses this setting), and 0 for 7 bit ascii. For a
complete list of language and character set values, look under Language
Identifiers and Code Page Identifiers in the Win32 help file.
</P>
<P>
Your version resource can contain multiple values in its var info block. Each
value in the var info block will contain a corresponding string info block. The
collection of string info blocks begin with the line <TT>BLOCK "StringFileInfo"</TT>
Each string info block contains a <TT>BLOCK</TT> value that links it to a var
info block value. In this example, the <TT>BLOCK</TT> value is <TT>"040904B0"</TT>.
Observe that <TT>0x0409</TT> matches the language setting, and <TT>0x04B0</TT>
is 1200 in Hex, which matches the character set.
</P>
<P>
The string info block contains a number of string settings. Some of these settings
are required: <TT>CompanyName</TT>, <TT>FileDescription</TT>, <TT>FileVersion</TT>,
<TT>InternalName</TT>, <TT>OriginalName</TT>, and <TT>ProductName</TT>. The
others are optional. You can even add new strings. For example, Microsoft Word
adds two strings called <TT>LegalTrademarks1</TT> and <TT>LegalTrademarks2</TT>.
These extra strings will appear when a user views the version info of your program.
</P>
<P>
<B>Note 6:</B> When user views the version info from your program, the dialog box
will display the version number from the <TT>FileVersion</TT> section of the
String Info Block. The data from the fixed info block is not displayed.
</P>
<P>
<B>Note: 7</B> The <TT>\xA9</TT> inserts a copyright character into the version resource
string. See the example of the <TT>LegalCopyright</TT> above.
</P>
<P>
<B>Note:8</B> The sample below shows how to structure a version resource if it
needs to contain several values in the Variable Information Block.
