Abstract
<p>
We investigate the photometric and kinematic characteristics of galaxies 
in 8 close pairs of ellipticals involving a bright galaxy and a faint companion of compact aspect.
<p>
The photometric and geometric characteristics of the individual galaxies
are determined after an automatic iterative procedure disentangles the
light contribution from each galaxy of the pairs. Redshifts and central
velocity dispersions are also determined, from high-dispersion spectra.
The fainter galaxies of our pairs have photometric and kinematic 
characteristics intermediate between those of massive and compact
(M32-type) ellipticals. Evidence for interaction in these pairs includes
strong isophote twists in most galaxies and isophote off-centerings in
two pairs, but no truncation of the photometric profiles.
Despite the interaction, our galaxies belong to the ``fundamental plane''
of ellipticals. This is evidence for the robustness of this plane against
gravitational encounters. Furthermore, their mean surface brightness and 
their central velocity dispersion are tightly correlated with their
luminosity. This is particularly true for the fainter galaxies which are among
the ellipticals of higher surface brightness and velocity dispersion
at a given luminosity.
This leads us to define two sequences of ellipticals 
(excluding dwarf spheroidals) on the vbasis of their kinematic and
photometric characteristics, extending earlier work by Michard.
Our galaxies, as well as classical compact ellipticals and most
of the luminous ellipticals, appear to belong to the first sequence.
The galaxies of the second sequence are characterized by a lower 
surface brightness and a lower velocity dispersion than sequence I galaxies.
<p>
Gravitational interaction provides a physical basis for this dichotomy.
Our pairs belong to sequence I, composed of systems whose properties result 
from their presence in a dense environment. The galaxies of sequence II
evolve toward sequence I through dissipation of internal energy
and loss of angular momentum, driven by the tidal interaction.
This scenario is suggested to be a general and important factor in
the dynamical evolution of elliptical galaxies.
