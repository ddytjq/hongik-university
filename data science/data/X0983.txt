<p><b>PROFILES OF MEN'S DISC GOLF PLAYERS FROM SIX COUNTRIES:</b>
</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Barry Schultz- Stevens Point, Wisconsin, USA</b> </li>
</ol>

<p>Age: 31 years old </p>

<p>Records: </p>

<p>3rd in Men's open division at the 1999 PDGA World Championship
</p>

<p>2nd in Men's open division at the 2000 PDGA World Championship
</p>

<p>When it comes to the epitome of sportsmanship on and off the
course, here is the man. A well-known MR. NICE-GUY is a leading
competitor with superb skill of a pinpoint throw which is up to
150 meters. Wherever he putts on the course, his superb mental
toughness is undoubtedly programmed to win. He quotes, &#147;I am
very proud to achieve a reputation as one of the 'professional
disc golfers' on tour because I have treated every course,
spotter, playing partner, tourney staff, and spectator with
respect and dignity.&#148; </p>

<p><b>2. Jesper Lundmark-Skelleftea, V”sterbotten, Sweden</b> </p>

<p>Age: 20 years old </p>

<p>Records: </p>

<p>3rd in Men's open division at the 2000 PDGA World Championship
</p>

<p>A champion in Men's open division at the 2000 Swedish Open
Championship </p>

<p>Recognized as a monster driver who booms a disc up to 150
meters precisely on the course and a future promising shining
star since his earlier age. </p>

<p>Perhaps, a disc golf's most intense competitor, and he is
definitely determined to be. </p>

<p><b>3. Michael Sullivan- Toronto, Ontario, Canada</b> </p>

<p>Age: 37 years old </p>

<p>Records: </p>

<p>50<sup>th</sup> in Men's open division at the 2000 PDGA World
Championship </p>

<p>112 career tour victories </p>

<p>There is an undefeatable master, called Sully, of its flight
for more than 20 years. Disc golf in Canada owes a great debt to
Sully, and this venue shall prove to be just one from of a great
payback. Sully also possesses one of the largest flying disc
collections in the world---over 15,000 frisbees. </p>

<p><b>4. Derek Robins - Kenilworth, Warwickshire, UK</b> </p>

<p>Age: 40 years old </p>

<p>Record: </p>

<p>5 victories on the European Tour - three British Open, one
Belgian Open, and one European Championship, Welheim, Germany </p>

<p>1997 World Accuracy Champion in Masters division. </p>

<p>For disc golf, he quotes, &quot;You can play as well as you
can imagine. Believe it then see it.&quot; </p>

<p>Many years ago, he played 3 holes of disc golf with Nick Faldo
to demonstrate the game to spectators at the UK Frisbee
Championships. In a sense, he has one of the game's cheerist
demeanors and diplomats. Maybe he owes it to the game that's
given him so much. </p>

<p><b>5. Simon Feasey -Auckland, NZ </b></p>

<p>Age: 33 years old </p>

<p>Record: </p>

<p>Current New Zealand's disc golf tour ranking 1<sup>st</sup> </p>

<p>2nd in Men's open division at the 2000 New Zealand National
Championship </p>

<p>&#147;Winning is a priority ... BUT ... the game always comes
first,&#148; the Kiwi always mentions so. Remarkably, all of Team
New Zealand's members have at some stage over their Disc Sport
careers been awarded as &#147;Spirit of the Game&#148; and they
all know and understand the etiquette of the game, both on and
off the course. </p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Yusaku Yoshino- Tokyo ,Japan</b> </li>
</ol>

<p>Age: 21 years old </p>

<p>6<sup>th</sup> rank in Men's open division of the 2000
Japanese Professional Disc Golf Association annual rankings </p>

<p>Friendly attitude and fierce competitiveness makes him what he
is all about to the game. He is capable of consistently throwing
a disc more than 120 meters with a light 150 gram disc more than
anybody else in Japan so far. </p>

<p><b>PROFILES OF WOMEN'S DISC GOLF PLAEYERS FROM SIX COUNTRIES:</b>
</p>

<ol>

        every available year-end honor. She takes responsibility
        for her marvelous talent, biting the bullet far beyond
        the women's category. Motto: &#147;Leave the course
        cleaner than you found it.&#148; Graciousness is also a
        big item with JK. </li>
    <li><b>Niloofar Mossavar Rahmani</b> <b>- Norrk&#150;ping,
        Sweden</b> </li>
    <li>Age: 28 years old </li>
    <li>Record: </li>
    <li>A champion in Women's open division at the Swedish Disc
        Golf tournament twice </li>
    <li>A champion in Women's open division at the 2000 Swedish
        National Disc Golf Championship </li>
    <li>When it comes to Swedish players, they are stereotyped as
        being cool and stoic. </li>
    <li>It just doesn't apply to Niloofar in this case. Niloofar
        has been exceptionally too having fun with disc golfing
        since 1995. Her talent of putting and consistency is
        excelled. &#147; Too have fun and play well,&#148; that's
        what she says. </li>
    <li><b>Elaine Vandenberg - Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada</b> </li>
    <li>Age: 39 </li>
    <li>Record: </li>

    <li>A distinguished major title holder of the record for
        5-time's consecutive winner in women's World Championship
        tournament history. &#147;Have fun and enjoy the company
        of the other participants,&#148; she puts it mildly. She
        obviously owes remarkable success to her tough equanimity
        and consistency. &#147;If I throw a bad shot, I try not
        to get upset or frustrated, but to understand what
        happened to cause me to throw incorrectly, and to avoid
        doing it again.&#148; She's got technique, mental
        toughness, and physical strength what it takes to be a
        champ. </li>
    <li><b>Ruth Steele- Reading, Berkshire, UK</b> </li>
    <li>Age: 26 years old </li>
    <li>Record: </li>

    <li>A champion at the 1998, 1999, and 2000 British Women's
        Disc Golf Championship </li>
    <li>&#147;Fair play and courtesy to others - something
        lacking from many other sports these days,&#148; is what
        she is all about. Steele has great drive and has the most
        guts to the game than anyone else. Although Steele's
        career has remained sporadic, it's always fun to watch
        her big arm in the tournament. </li>

</ol>

<p>Age: 34 </p>

<p>&quot;Ma te kaha, ka Waimarie...There is no victory without
spirit,&quot; as Roobie says so. Her image is that of a nice
woman. Her quality in sportsmanship always reminds us of the
bright future of the game and she is determined to go for it. </p>
