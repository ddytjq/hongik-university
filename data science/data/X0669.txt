HTML=<Title> 1996 In-Flight Open Results </title> <H2>HARTLAND TAKES THE INFLIGHT OPEN </H2> <B>Lansing, MI -- </B> The InFlight Open, a longtime Guts tradition, has nowevolved into a tournament focused on disc golf, with Guts only a minorsideshow.  According to Tournament Director Pad Timmons, the InFlight isnow one of America's premiere disc golf events, with a large cash purse andcompetitors from as far away as Sweden and Japan.<P>	Unfortunately, the sport of Guts is no where near as healthy as disc golf. Only ten people showed up to actually PLAY Guts.  Those who did attend weretreated to nearly perfect conditions: temperatures in the low 80s, littleor no wind, and mostly sunny skies.  The only drawback was the hard, drycondition of the field due to Lansing's recent lack of rain.<P>	The three teams were The Crips (Art McGuff, Steve Buckley, Will Sirrine,and Mike Flynn), Remington Blue Rock (Fran Townsend, Thom Marusich, and DanThornton), and Hartland (Bill Begoske, John Begoske, and Dave Young).<P>	Because of the small turnout, the tournament was shortened to a single day. Guts Director Thom Marusich settled on a double round robin format with21-point games and a point for a catch.  The results of the round robinwould be carried into a true double-elimination bracket format, with thetop two teams from the round robin meeting in the winners' bracket finaland the third place team being charged with their first loss.<P>	In the first rotation, The Crips beat RBR 21-8, then lost to Hartland21-11.  Remington Blue Rock led Hartland early in the third game, buteventually fell 21-17.<P>	The second round started with a narrow Hartland victory, 21-19, over TheCrips, who took their frustrations out on RBR, 21-18.  In the final roundrobin game, Remington Blue Rock started strong against Hartland once again,but faltered after 14 and finally lost 21-16.<P>	Hartland carried their momentum into the winners' bracket final, toppingThe Crips 21-13.  That sent The Crips down to the losers' bracket where RBRcame up short (and frequently wide) once again, losing 21-14.<P>	The Crips would need two straight wins to take the championship away fromHartland.  But the hands and the shots were nearly flawless on the Hartlandend of the field.  Bill Begoske made a great saving kick-up from flat onhis back, and brother Johnny solidly anchored the center of the line.  WhenHartland is in that zone, there may be no team capable of beating them, andSaturday was no exception.  The final score of 21-11 earned Hartland $160and a beautiful trophy.  Their undefeated record makes them the odds-onfavorite for the Marquette tournament next month.<P>   <B>Dan Thornton dthornto@usa.pipeline.com</B>
