1978 Chevy Nova
<BR>
225 c.i. inline 6 engine - paid $100.00
<BR>
Ran good, but brakes were very weak.
<BR>
The frame had came unbolted from the unibody.  
<BR>
Had to do some creative chaining and bolting to get it back on.
<BR>
Car ran good, but my driving was poor.  
<BR>
Maybe I shouldn't have run those bald tires up front.
<BR>
At one point I ran of course.  Boy can those judges move when the have to!
<BR>
Finished heat, but didn't win.  Ran the consultation heat, but again didn't win.
