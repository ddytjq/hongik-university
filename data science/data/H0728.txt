					<p>With the help of interviews and participating observations from decision makers from the gene technology industry, the research team worked out a list of ten popular misconceptions about the public attitude toward green gene technology. The individ-ual points are:</p>
<p>1. The main problem is that laymen lack the necessary expertise.</p>
<p>2. One is either for or against gene technology.</p>
<p>3. Consumers accept gene technology in medicine; yet refuse it in the food industry and in agriculture.</p>
<p>4. European consumers behave egocentrically compared to poor people in third world countries.</p>
<p>5. Consumers want labelling so they can practice their right of free choice.</p>
<p>6. The public wrongly thinks that genetically modified organisms are unnatural.</p>
<p>7. The whole misery is based on the BSE crisis: since then, consumers no longer trust the regulations set by the appropriate institutions.</p>
<p>8. The public demands zero risk, which cannot be realistic.</p>
<p>9. The public rejection of gene technology is based on other ethical or political fac-tors.</p>
<p>10. The public is an easily influenced victim in light of distorted portrayals in the me-dia.</p>
<p>Subsequently, they looked at how much truth there was to these misconceptions in a total of 55 moderated group discussions with randomly chosen citizens (focus groups). Most of the notions emerged as myths. Surprisingly, the discussions in the 55 focus groups led to different results. It is not true that the resistance against ge-netically modified plants comes from a mixture of ignorance and risk aversions in the European population, as apparently assumed by the majority of decision makers.</p>
<p>"The opponents of gene technology are very much aware of the fact that normal life is full of risks that have to be balanced against each other", says Prof. Ortwin Renn, executive director of the TA Academy, who took over the German part of the project "Public Perception of Agricultural Biotechnologies in Europe" (PABE). " The root of the conflict lies not in the technology itself, yet in the way the authorities deal with it", so Ortwin Renn.</p>
<p>Decision makers should therefore place the social advantages of the new technology in the foreground and should invest more in dialogues with the public about the ori-entation of scientific research, instead of emphasizing the discrepancy between mar-ket possibilities and public irrationalities, suggests Renn. "In order to win the public trust, the authorities have to prove over a long period of time that they can admit to earlier mistakes, and the way decisions are made has to be revealed just as the em-phasis of conflicting interests, risks and chances", so Renn. "Institutions can only enjoy that trust when they show that they understand, respect and consult the public opinion".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="info"><strong>Contact person: Prof. Ortwin Renn, Tel. 0711/9063-160 </strong><br />
