<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>"N" is the number of terms in the formula and is also the true number of spatial dimensions in the structure.   The next two columns are self explanatory.   The V<sup>n</sup> column is the expression for the sum of the points <em>less than or equal to</em> the radius r<strong>;</strong> it's the topological "volume" of the structure in all n dimensions, even though "volume" in our Euclidean world is accurate only when n = 3.

<p>

<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>S<sup>n - 1</sup>, the "surface", is intriguing because the expression here is always the derivative with respect to r of the formula in the same row of the V<sup>n</sup> column.   Again, "surface" is accurate in Euclidean terms only when n - 1 = 2 (or n = 3), although S refers topologically to this type of space no matter what value n assumes.   The formula here refers to the sum of all points in n - 1 dimensions <em>equal to</em> the radius r.

<p>

<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The unusual topological characteristics of an S-type structure have been referred to for years in a variety of ways<strong>:</strong>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>"Finite but unbounded", because it has finite size but no formal boundary<strong>;</strong> <li>"Multiply-connected", since there is more than one way to reach another position<strong>;</strong> and 
<li>"Curves back on itself", because an apparently straight path from a position in S-type space is a circular route - called a "geodesic" - and returns to the original position from the opposite direction.   
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>

<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Thus an S-type structure has a positive global curvature in such a manner that, if r = constant, a route around the circle/sphere/hypersphere is always 2<font face=symbol>p</font>r.  On the other hand, if r >>> 0 - that is, r is very large - we have no way of knowing from local observations whether the structure we occupy is V<sup>n</sup>,  presumably orthogonal, or S<sup>n</sup>, globally curved.

<p>
<blockquote><FONT COLOR="red">
[It would not be an exaggeration to say that the object of these essays is to specify the assumption about a very large elastically expanding structure which allows us to differentiate between V<sup>n</sup> and S<sup>n</sup> which, when n = 3, is the topological difference between Friedmann space and Riemannian space.]
</FONT></blockquote>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Knowing the lower-dimensional formula is the derivative in calculus helps understand why the lower-dimensional structure is frequently referred to as the "skin", "membrane", or "surface" of the higher-dimensional structure.   For example, we could say that the area defined by 4<font face=symbol>p</font>r<sup>2</sup> is the "skin" or "surface"  (S<sup>2</sup>) of the 3D sphere whose volume is given by 4<font face=symbol>p</font>r<sup>3</sup>/3 (V<sup>3</sup>).   
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Another example<strong>:</strong> the physicists Lisa Randall and Raman Sundrum <A HREF="http://focus.aps.org/v4/st28.html">in this article</A> refer to a large (uncompactified) fourth spatial dimension and mention a "3-brane" in which we presumably observe most, but not all, physical activity.   Their "3-brane" is what a topologist would typically refer to as the S<sup>3</sup> "surface" of a V<sup>4</sup> (Riemannian)  hypersphere.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>So even though 2,300 years of Euclidean geometry probably make a curved "Riemannian surface" in S<sup>3</sup> difficult to understand at first, the familiar Euclidean relationships that S<sup>1</sup> has with V<sup>2</sup> and S<sup>2</sup> has with V<sup>3</sup> are virtually duplicated in the Riemannian relationship that S<sup>3</sup> has with V<sup>4</sup>.

[Although I'm not interested in anything beyond the four-space Riemannian hypersphere in these essays, properties of even higher-dimensional hyperspheres are presented <A HREF="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hypersphere.html">at this site</A> by Eric Weisstein.   
This particular file gives you more trigonometric information about the hypersphere, including the derivation of the "surface" formula at the end.
<p>
Be sure to take the link to "Ball" at the bottom.   Once you get there, go to a table about two-thirds of the way to the bottom of the scroll bar.    It's understood that you mentally insert the radius r<sup>n</sup> in the V (volume) column and r<sup>n-1</sup> in the S (surface) column.   Once you do that you'll realize that this table shows the derivative relationship between V and S and extends it to the higher-dimensional structures.]

</FONT>
<pre>
</pre>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The key to unraveling the presumed "mystery" of Riemann's 4D hypersphere is to understand the critical significance of one very simple property<strong>:</strong> <strong>embeddedness</strong>, which means that under certain circumstances (when one or more of the terms equals zero) the algebraic equation with fewer terms <u>as well as the geometric structure it represents</u> is a legitimate solution of the equation with the greater number of terms.   
<pre>
</pre>
<FONT COLOR=red>
<blockquote>
[Of course, we know intuitively that a circle in (x,y) is "embedded" in a spherical aurface in (x,y,z).   And the table above clearly indicates that a spherical surface is "embedded" in Riemann's 4D hypersphere in like manner.   But whether this concept can be used for proper analysis of space in the universe depends on the <em>nature</em> of that space, and is the topic <A HREF="App1.html">of Appendix 1</A>.   In the type of S<sup>3</sup>/V<sup>4</sup> space I will derive in Essay #3, "embeddedness" is OK, but it is <em>not</em> OK - I repeat, <em>not</em> OK - in the usual (open, flat, closed) Friedmann models.]    
</font>
</blockquote>
<p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>For example, this formula describes a hypersphere whose radius changes with time (t): <p><p><strong><center> 
<A NAME="22Eq4">Equation 1: x<sup>2</sup>(t) + y<sup>2</sup>(t) + z<sup>2</sup>(t) + w<sup>2</sup>(t) = r<sup>2</sup>(t).</A></center>       <br></strong>There are any number of assumptions we might make about how the hypersphere changes with time.   We might assume, for example, that its necessarily curved space is "infinitely elastic", which means that this space can expand forever and/or that it has expanded from virtually nothing.   Perhaps we might suppose the hypersphere collapses to zero size when we look around it exactly one time.   Or we could assume that the rate of expansion of this hypersphere was either higher or lower in earlier times than it is today.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>But whatever assumptions we make, we're certain of one thing<strong>:</strong> the geometric behavior which is applicable to the higher-dimensional hypersphere is equally applicable to the lower-dimensional circle and spherical surface.   We know this is true because the formulas defining these structures are legitimate solutions of the higher-dimensional hypersphere in certain circumstances, when one or more of the non-temporal parameters just happens to be zero. 
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>As a trivial example, let's suppose r = 4,000 miles in the above equation and that r = constant (so we can ignore t).   This would define a hypersphere with the same radius as the earth<strong>;</strong> I call it a "terrestrial hypersphere".   If we traveled along what seems to be a "straight" line in <em>any</em> direction for about 25,000 miles through this curved space, we would wind up right back where we started after going all the way "around" the hypersphere.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>How do we know this?
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Because the circle and the spherical surface with the same radius of 4,000 miles are "embedded" in this curved space and their circumference is also about 25,000 miles. 
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>And "embeddedness" works in <em>both</em> directions<strong>:</strong> we might make certain assumptions about the way a circle/spherical surface are behaving, and then assume this behavior is applicable to the higher-dimensional hypersphere in which they are "embedded". 
<p>
<A NAME="expanding">  </A>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>For example, if a 4D hypersphere is expanding, the rate of expansion we <em>observe</em> will be deceptively high.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Why?
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Because the circle and the spherical surface are embedded in this metric (when two or one of the terms equal zero) and we know that the circumference of a circle and a spherical surface increases faster than its radius for the simple reason that the circumference C = 2<font face=symbol>p</font>r.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color=red>[OK, <A HREF="App11.html">Appendix 11</A> explains what the problem is with Greek letters on the two browsers.   Here is the above formula with Netscape coding: C = 2 &pi r, which should look OK in Netscape, but pretty silly on the IE browser.]
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Precisely the same principle is applicable to the curved space of the hypersphere because we can only look out <em>along its circumference</em>.   So if the hypersphere correctly describes the universe we see, in one fell swoop we can sweep away one of the most formidable problems in the big bang model because a substantial amount of matter has been inferred from a rate of expansion (aka Hubble parameter) that may be too high because we're measuring it along the <em>surface</em> or <em>circumference</em> of the hypersphere, rather than its radius.

<center><H3>Two Myths about the Hypersphere</H3></center>
</FONT>
<pre>
</pre>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Before we get much further into the realm of the 4D hypersphere, let's dispel two myths about this non-Euclidean foreigner right now<strong>:</strong> 
<pre>
</pre>
<strong>
<blockquote><FONT COLOR="navy">
<u>Myth #1</u>: It is IMPOSSIBLE for us to comprehend what happens in any structure with more than the three spatial dimensions we're accustomed to in our Euclidean world.
</FONT></blockquote>
</strong>
<pre>
</pre>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Wrong!
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>It's not all that difficult for us to think in at least <strong>one</strong> more spatial dimension (that is, S<sup>3</sup> on the "surface" of V<sup>4</sup>) provided (1) we understand that the three-dimensional spherical surface is <em>embedded</em> in this space, and (2) we realize the "extra" dimension lies <em>at right angles</em> to the conventional three-dimensional spherical surface. <p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<FONT COLOR=red>
[Note: Why the fourth spatial dimension lies at right angles to a spherical 
surface is explained in <a HREF="App2.html">Appendix 2</A>.]
</FONT>
</blockquote>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>So if we assume that light is constrained to the spherical surface and analyze what happens to our perception of objects at various positions on this surface, we know that not only does this behavior actually occur <em>on</em> the spherical surface (because of "embeddedness"), it also occurs <em>at right angles</em> to this spherical surface, as shown in Appendix 2. 
<A NAME="Myth2">   </A> 
<pre>
</pre>
<strong>
<blockquote><FONT COLOR="navy">
<u>Myth #2</u>: The 4D hypersphere can't be visualized easily by those of us confined to three-dimensional thinking.
</FONT>
</blockquote>
</strong>
<pre>
</pre>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Again, this myth is false!
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>To show why it's false, let's examine first the surface of a sphere.   Although we understand that it's curved, we also know that its area can be defined in two-dimensional terms<strong>:</strong> 4<font face=symbol>p</font>r<sup>2</sup>, as shown in the <A HREF="#table">table</A> above.   And we could approximate this curved surface reasonably well by representing each hemisphere as a very ordinary circle.   The center on one circle would be the "north pole", the center of the other circle would be the "south pole", and the edge of each circle would be the "equator" on the earth's surface.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>But if we did it this way, we would encounter the same problem we <em>always</em> encounter when we try to represent a curved surface like the earth using one less spatial dimension than it really has<strong>:</strong> we have to show a "break" or "discontinuity" that isn't there.   The best we can do here is to show the two circles contiguous at only <strong>one</strong> position (like a pair of coins touching each other), even though we recognize the two circles are contiguous at <strong>all</strong> positions.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Thus the intrinsically curved surface of the earth in S<sup>2</sup> can be <em>approximated</em> by a flat two-dimensional map in V<sup>2</sup>, and this is something we do routinely in, say, the more conventional Mercator projections.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>A very similar exercise allows us to get a good idea of the geometry of the hypersphere.   Obviously its space is curved, even though we can express the volume on its "surface" in three-dimensional terms: 2<font face=symbol>p</font><sup>2</sup>r<sup>3</sup> ( again, see the above <A HREF="#table">table</A>).  And, like what we did on the spherical surface, we can divide this curved space in half and represent each "hemi-hypersphere" as a very ordinary three-dimensional sphere.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Again, we've got exactly the same type of problem we had before<strong>:</strong> these two spheres are actually contiguous at <strong>all</strong> surface positions.   But since we're representing the hypersphere in one less dimension than it really has, the best we can do is to show the two spheres contiguous at only <strong>one</strong> position (like a pair of baseballs touching each other).
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The two-sphere configuration illustrates the hypersphere just as well as the two circles approximate the spherical surface.   Both representations give us a very good idea of the geometry of the respective higher-dimensional structures using one less spatial dimension than they really have.
<p>
<blockquote>
<FONT COLOR=red>
<p>
<A NAME="return2">  </A>
[Note: It's no accident why both lower-dimensional visualizations of the respective 
higher-dimensional structures are so similar.   <A HREF="App3.html">Appendix 3</a> explains 
how you create a 4D hypersphere from a 3D spherical surface and it gives a simple proof showing why this representation of the hypersphere using V<sup>3</sup> geometry is tolerably accurate.   <p>
If it helps to actually <em>see</em> the two spheres, they are shown on page 4 (of the 32 page pdf version) of the article on <a href="http://xxx.lpthe.jussieu.fr/abs/gr-qc/0106033">Topological Lensing in Spherical Space</a> by Evelise Gaussman, Roland Lehoucq, Jean-Pierre Luminet, Jean-Philippe Uzan, and Jeffrey Weeks.]
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The most important thing to understand about the w term - at least the way I'm using it here (in Riemann's hypersphere) - is that <em>it projects the global curvature of a spherical surface into the comparably curved space of the hypersphere</em>.   This is why, for example, that if a two-circle configuration is a reasonably good approximation for the spherical surface, the two-sphere configuration is an <em>equally good</em> approximation for the four-space hypersphere.    
<A NAME="antipode">  </A>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Provided we assume light is confined to a spherical surface, we always look toward its opposite side as we look "around" the surface.   And, because of "embeddedness", the same thing happens on the hypersphere<strong>:</strong> if we're at the center of one sphere of the two-sphere configuration, we'll always look toward the center of the other sphere.   The center of this second sphere is the "opposite side" of the hypersphere; it's as far away as we can see before our line of sight starts coming back.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Just as the route around a sphere with a constant radius r is 2<font face=symbol>p</font>r and halfway around (to the opposite pole) is <font face=symbol>p</font>r, then a route all the way around the hypersphere is likewise 2<font face=symbol>p</font>r and the length of the path to the opposite side is <font face=symbol>p</font>r.
<p>
<blockquote><FONT COLOR="red">
[Perhaps a more relevant question is how far away is the antipode in a hypersphere that collapses to zero size when we look around it precisely one time.   As you will see shortly in a file linked to the end of Essay #3, there's a simple way to get a "ballpark" estimate.] 
</FONT></blockquote>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>But what happens to our observations if an antipode in S<sup>3</sup> is close enough to affect what we see?
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>This is the primary topic of Essay #2.
