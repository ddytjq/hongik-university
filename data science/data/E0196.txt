<FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>The Object Magazine Online Interview:</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Bjarne Stroustrup</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Object Magazine Online: What is your
favorite software tool or environment? I'd ask what's your favorite programming language
first, but that would be somewhat rhetorical!</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Bjarne Stroustrup: Maybe; C++ is indeed
my favorite programming language. However, we should always remember that there are
<I>lots</I> of interesting and useful programming languages. Nobody who knows one
programming language should consider himself a professional programmer or designer.
Learning a new programming language or a new programming technique is a delight.
We ought to try hard not to get too busy to experiment with new tools, languages,
and techniques.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">UNIX is still my favorite environment.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: I agree on the language front.
As for special purpose languages; I just created a new Web version of the comp.object
FAQ by utilizing perl's pattern matching and report writing capabilities -- it went
much faster than if I had used C or C++. I also prefer and was bred on UNIX, although
I see PCs as having their place.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>What is your favorite Pattern?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: I don't (yet?) think in terms of named
patterns; I think in terms of techniques and fundamental examples. However, I often
find uses for the &quot;factory&quot; pattern. In particular, that is the pattern
that allows me to create objects of an unknown derived class where a piece of code
requires only knowledge of a common -- more general -- base. Together with extensive
use of abstract classes, this pattern allows me to write applications that rely directly
on abstract classes only, and thus allows me to write applications and library modules
that have very minimal and well-defined dependencies on environments. A traditional
name for a variant of the factory pattern in the C++ community has been &quot;virtual
constructors.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: I've used virtual constructors
on many occasions, so they seem quite useful. What is your favorite component model
and which do you think will win out in the long run? Examples are CORBA, DCOM, OpenDoc,
Beans/RMI, etc.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: I don't have a favorite. I live in
hope that something far more elegant and/or general will come along. The models you
mention all seem too large, too complicated, too hard to use, too hard to integrate
with a programming language, too proprietary, or incur too much overhead to be ideal.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">And no, I don't have an alternative. It
seems to me that there is something fundamental missing, but I have not been able
to put my finger on it. I'm looking for something that allows synchronous and asynchronous
calls to coexist smoothly, something that can be closely integrated into a variety
of programming languages, and something where modules loaded into a single address
space can communicate as efficiently as two classes compiled together. To deliver
all we require of a component model, such a model must be complex, but does that
complexity really need to be visible to a novice? To someone doing something fundamentally
simple? I doubt it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: Excellent point. What is your favorite
software methodology? And what do you think about the UML?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: I'm not personally a user of diagrams,
and what little I have read about the UML had an unpleasent messianic tone to it
that obscured the technical content. This may be a case where it does make sense
to &quot;shoot the messenger,&quot; though, because the fundamental ideas seem sound.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">When I get a bit of time, I'll try to see
if UML can model the C++ standard library simply and accurately. If so, it should
be able to handle much of what will become interesting in the future; if not, it
has become stuck with a limiting view of what software is. The STL (the containers,
algorithms, and iterators framework) is a good test of elegant composition of software
and from independent parts.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: Good points. I think we often just
hear the hype and best wishes, like with the component models. How important a role
do you think methodologies play in software development today? I know you discuss
this subject in <I>The C++ Programming Language,</I></B></FONT><A HREF="#refs"><FONT
SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><SUP><B>1</B></SUP></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>
but could you briefly summarize your latest views?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: And I thought that reducing the discussion
of design to a single chapter with two supporting chapters of examples was pretty
extreme! I think that the focus on all software development must be on concepts and
the understanding of the application domain.</FONT>

</TABLE>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">For larger projects, the rules and processes
we call methods are necessary, for smaller projects less-rigorous approaches are
often preferable. Methods are too often used in attempts to compensate for lack of
direction, for lack of a conceptual framework for the system being built, and a lack
of concepts in the programming used. A method is not a substitute for thinking and
understanding. Methods should be applied flexibly enough to accomodate the varying
talents, tastes, and weaknesses of a diverse manager, designer, and programmer population.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">That said, I favor an approach to design
roughly along the lines of Booch -- probably with a greater emphasis on general concepts
and static structure than is fashionable. For details, see Part IV of <I>The C++
Programming Language</I> (third edition).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: What is your favorite operating
system, and what computer do you work on everyday?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: I use UNIX on an antique SPARC station
and on an SGI. I run Windows 95 and NT on my laptop.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: Are you much of a Web surfer?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: I use the Web. I probably visit a dozen
sites a day, but the Web isn't central to my life. Email is still much more important
to me. I download the odd technical article, and buy the odd item, but much of the
information I find on the Web is too fragmented, unreliable, and ideosyncratic for
real learning. I guess the Web has in a short period of time become a valuable resource
for me, but I still don't rely on it for anything essential.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">I maintain a set of homepages with a fair
amount of information about C++: </FONT><A HREF="http://research.att.com/~bs" target="new window"><FONT
SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">research.att.com/~bs</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">.
You can find a few of my papers there, together with descriptions of my books, errata,
a FAQ, links to C++ related sites, etc.</FONT></P>

target="new window"><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OO FAQ</B></FONT></A><FONT
SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>, Appendix E;-) What do you think about Java?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: Not much. It's a fairly uninteresting
language and a very interesting sociological phenomenon, but it's peripheral to my
professional interests.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">People who insist on comparing Java to
C++ should take a look at my design criteria for C++ in <I>The Design and Evolution
of C++.</I></FONT><A HREF="#refs"><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></A><FONT
SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"> They will see that Java comes nowhere near my ideals
for a general-purpose programming language.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: I've always seen Java as having
libraries for graphics and Web work. But do you think there's room for other programming
languages?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: In addition to C++? :-) Certainly.
No <I>one</I>programming language comes anywhere near serving all the diverse needs
of current programmers. In theory, there could be a single general-purpose programming
language. However, I think differences in emphasis, different intellectual traditions,
and differences in taste will ensure that several will exist. In addition, there
will always be a need for a plethora of specialized languages.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Also, knowing several languages is simply
interesting and also good for you.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: I've heard this before, that learning
several languages avoids a mindset on any particular one -- a good principle in general.
What do you think will come of the current Microsoft/Sun debate over Java?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: The &quot;debate&quot; is pretty disgraceful,
but inevitable given Sun's attempt to establish Java as an alternative platform to
Windows and as a programming language to the exclusion of all other programming languages.
It is really a food fight fought by means foul and fair. It gives little credit to
either side and appears to hurt innocent bystanders (though the C++ community seems
mostly unaffected and growing as usual).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">I think the result will be several almost-compatible
Java variants and a fair number of platform-specific libraries. Sun, MS, and probably
others want a Java that is platform independent yet runs better on their own platform
than on platforms supplied by competitors. This will ensure that genuine platform
independence for nontrivial applications will remain an elusive goal.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: I have the new third edition of
<I>The C++ Programming Language,</I> famous successor to <I>The C Programming Language</I>
otherwise known as K&amp;R. Is this the last and final edition, and could you tell
us a little about it?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: Well, you can't write the final book
on a living language. However, we now have an ISO C++ standard so my 3rd edition
has a more durable subject matter than its two predecessor. The 1st edition had a
useful life of more than five years and the 2nd was still a bestseller in its sixth
year when the 3rd was published. Based on that, it seems reasonable to predict a
useful life of at least seven years for the 3rd edition.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">I think the real importance of my 3rd edition
is that the programming techniques supported by C++ have matured. Language features
are in themselves just boring; what is interesting is the programming and design
techniques they exist to support, the ways in which the language features can be
used to provide elegant, efficient, and maintainable systems.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">The primary aim of the 3rd is to serve
as an introduction for experienced programmers and for C++ programmers who want to
catch up with all that has happened over the last few years. Experienced programmers
deserve better than the thin fare that is typically offered to novices. I try not
to insult the intelligence of my readers. My 3rd edition can also serve as a user-level
reference because all major language features and standard library facilities are
presented. I think that so much has been learned about how to use C++ effectively
that many people's view of C++ is completely outdated.</FONT>

</TABLE>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">My 3rd describes all the new language features
that people expect from a modern C++ book: exceptions, templates, runtime type identification,
namespaces, etc. It also describes, all the new library facilities: containers, algorithms,
numeric support, strings, parameterized io streams, etc. However, the emphasis is
on the programming and design techniques that these facilities support. Also, I don't
forget the basics: C compatibility, programming in the styles commonly used for C,
use of concrete and abstract classes, programming using class hierarchies, etc.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">I find C++ a more pleasant language to
use and to describe these days and I take advantage of that to present it in ways
that are easier to understand. The new standard library is a great help here.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: You mention C++ is a &quot;living
language,&quot; in that it may continue to grow and change. Will/could there be a
new standard and in what respects is C++ still alive/changing?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: Every ISO standard has to be revised,
reconfirmed, or withdrawn every five years. I have no doubt that changes will be
made starting about six years from now. During these five year cycles [we need to
develop] a mechanism for handling defect reports and resolving the problems they
point out exist.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">What I meant is that so much work is being
done using C++ and so many experiments are performed that it is inconcievable that
there won't be changes after the period of stability caused by the standard. If nothing
else, many new techniques will be developed and many interesting libraries will see
heavy use. Such activities can significantly affect the way to describe and teach
a language even if no changes are made to the language definition.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: What would you say are the most
influential forces in the computing industry today? You could just name a few favorites.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: Or a few villans? Maybe the most influential
and most destructive current is the pervasive push to dumb down computing. We don't
seem to be able to educate enough smart people to get our systems built well. This
is made far worse by the incessant push to deliver systems immediately.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Given that we can either invest in better
tools for competent systems builders with a solid understanding of their application
domains or we can try to simplify and foolproof our tools to the point where someone
not too bright and without much education can produce something acceptable. I fear
that the second approach is the most popular and inevitably leads to unreliable bloatware.
Just about anything that counters that trend is on my list of favorites.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Better education at all levels comes high
on my list, and by that I mean a demanding blend of theory and practice for bright
people -- not leveling down. The patterns movement and the push for better design
deserve praise. I think better programming languages are part of a solution, but
it can only be a part. Someone who thinks that a better programming language can
&quot;solve the software crisis&quot; is sadly deluded. Anyway, the question of what
constitutes a better programming language is fraught with both politics and genuine
hard problems.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: I agree on the education and advanced
learning forefront -- when I last taught a C++/UML course I tended to talk about
the more sophisticated topics, such as sibling communication through virtual inheritance
or DMI and class combinatorial solution idioms, but to students just learning what
a class is. Perhaps I was a little off...but I do put proper use in context.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>BS:</B> We should be careful to present
novices -- even experienced programmers who are novices with C++ -- with a coherent
set of concepts supported by <I>simple</I> examples before progressing to really
advanced stuff.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">I remember almost despairing of learning
Ada because the Ada people I listened to were busy impressing each other with how
advanced their understanding of Ada was and how fantastically complicated [the] cases
they could handle [were]. I thought &quot;if that's what it takes to understand Ada
and use it, I'm not sure that I want to.&quot; Then, I decided that they were just
showing off and things were simpler than they appeared.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: Do you think C++ will find its
way into Web computing? How?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">It ought to, and it ought not be too hard
to do. I think that as services mature, C++'s flexibility, efficiency, and facilities
for coping with complexity will come to good use. However, it will happen only if
someone makes it their business to make it happen. We need C++ libraries for doing
&quot;Webbish&quot; things. In the absence of basic library support, it is easier
to use special-purpose tools and languages. I don't know if such C++ Web-service
support libraries exist or are being built, but I'd like to see some.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: Mike's article in this issue points
us to </B></FONT><A HREF="http://www.objectmedia.com" target="new window"><FONT SIZE="2"
FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Object Media</B></FONT></A><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>,
where a number of the core Java libraries have been implemented in C++.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>But do you have any ideas on what the
future model may look like? For example in contrast to Java, where applets travel
to browsers on demand and perhaps in contrast to CGI, which runs on a server and
uses dynamic HTML to communicate with users. Do you have any ideas on what the future
of Web programming should be, or perhaps where C++ should play the greatest role?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: I would rather not be specific, because
I don't know enough to be certain about anything. C++ seems well-suited for server-side
stuff. However, it needs libraries for common things such as page presentation, simple
animation and statistics gathering to be effective in terms of the average service
provider's time.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">You can get C++ interpreters and other
mechanisms that allow downloading of C++ code. However, I'm worried about automatic
download of code -- in any language -- from a server to my machine.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Security is harder than most people are
willing to believe and much more important. As more money starts to flow though the
Web, more crooks will find it worthwhile to develop the tools and the sophistication
needed to divert some of that flow. Also, as we start placing more information on
our computers our personal lives gets vulnerable to viruses, etc. I expect to be
keeping many of my photographs and many of my financial records on computers soon.
I'm worried what accidental damage I can do to my own information, and I'm rather
concerned what a random bit of code from a random person somewhere in the world might
do.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">I think my ideal language for downloaded
code is far simpler and far less powerful than what is being discused and deployed
today: &quot;almost braindead&quot; would be a reasonable criteria for anything that
needs to pass through a firewall -- and we should all have firewalls. Does your company
allow applets through their firewall? JavaScript? Dynamic HTML? Visual Basic macros?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: Good point -- we should all start
being more careful. Now that they're all finished, how satisfied are you with the
results of the C++ standardization efforts?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: I'm very happy with C++ as it emerged
from the standards process. No major feature that I know how to provide is missing
and no major feature that I would seriously like to remove is present.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">In particular, I'm very pleased that we
(that is, the C++ Standards Committee of which I have been an active member) managed
to accept the STL framework of efficient and type-safe containers (such as vector,
list, and map) and fundamental algorithms (such as find, sort, and accumulate). This
closes the most glaring hole in C++ as commonly shipped. Until now, we haven't had
a standard set of containers.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">The standard library makes it far simpler
to teach C++. No longer do we have to start out with low-level pointer manipulation
to accomodate C-style arrays and strings. Instead, we can use appropriate container
types and strings and thereby postpone the discussion of lower-level concepts until
students are ready to deal with them. Importantly, the standard containers and the
string class manage the storage for their elements and expand as needed. This means
that memory management becomes completely automatic for simple programs and far simpler
than it used to be for larger systems.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Naturally, the 3rd edition [of <I>the C++
Programing Language</I> explains this in some detail. It also relies on the standard
library to ease the introduction of concepts.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: What's next? Will there be another
iteration to C++? Another language?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: I designed C++ because I couldn't find
a programming language that served my needs. I would design another language only
if I again found a problem for which no existing language was a good tool/solution.
C++ is a perfectly good solution to most of the problems I face in my daily work,
and for the tasks where it is not, alternatives exist.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Currently, I'm working on some internal
AT&amp;T projects. In part, I'm trying to broaden my experience and to learn about
new and interesting problems. The AT&amp;T network is one of the worlds largest,
most complicated, and most reliable distributed systems. With the rapid evolution
of the telecommunications industry, there is no shortage of interesting problems.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: In the new C++ standard, there
are many additions such as templates for casting, including for checked downcasting,
which already exist in the language. I believe these are called static and dynamic
casts. Did you create this new notation, and why are they there?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: Yes, I was the one who invented the
<CODE>dynamic_cast</CODE> syntax to parallel the syntax for explicitly qualified
template function calls. Together with Dmitry Lenkov from HP, I was the proposer
of the runtime type identification (RTTI) mechanisms.</FONT>

		</TD>
	</TR>
</TABLE>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">RTTI is easily overused. However, for loosly-coupled
systems where objects are passed between separately-developed subsystems, RTTI is
inevitable. The <CODE>dynamic_cast</CODE> was designed as the ideal mechanism for
recovering enough type information to deal with objects that must be passed between
subsystems without making misuses too easy and tempting. If you design your system
so that major interfaces are abstract classes, <CODE>dynamic_cast</CODE> is the operation
you need for intermodule communication where you need it to discover which interfaces
(abstract classes) an object provides.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: So this means that because specialized
interfaces should't be used in intersubsystem communication/interfaces, objects passed
as parameters must first be upcast to some common base class (to pass through the
subsystem interface methods), and then downcast back to their more specific supported
(inherited) interfaces once through the wall, so that their more specialized methods
(not in the common base interface) may be accessed through this set of common (downcastable)
interfaces (abstract classes). This seems to call for two sets of common interfaces,
one used for intersubsystem communication and another for common objects which travel
between them, if I read you correctly.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: Yes. Note that the upcast is implicit
and automatic. Secondly, I imagine that the intermodule interface will often be the
abstract classes that constitute the key interfaces within an application. Have a
look at the <CODE>Io_obj</CODE> example from either D&amp;E or my 3rd edition [of
<I>The C++ Programming Language</I>]. That example shows how to &quot;bury&quot;
the system interfaces and the RTTI deep in the implementation of an inter-process
communication system. An application can be written almost exclusively in its own
terms (interfaces) and keep all knowledge of the underlying system localized.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">This actually has a rather strong relation
to what I said about the factory pattern. The key is to keep interfaces to things
that might vary at run time abstract.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: Are you a big fan of Streams?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">You mean the iostreams in the C++ standard
library? I guess I am. I was the one who invented streams and I find the general
concept most attractive. It is inherently type-safe, extensible, terse, and efficient.
Over the years, the stream library has gathered quite a few barnacles, though, and
it remains to be seen if implementations of the full-blown iostreams library can
deliver the efficiency inherent in the basic concept. I consider it obvious that
improvements to the current implementations are possible. For example, there is no
reason a simple &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program should take up more than a couple
of dozen kilobytes.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: Thanks. I was referring to the
general concept of streaming, which I find quite elegant and which also appears as
a metaphor outside of I/O. Strings (string streams) would provide the simplist example.
Do you prefer the C++ Standard Library's generic function approach to the old inheritance
approach? I heard you talk once about the efficiency gain by using this form of parametric
polymorphism instead of inclusion, but it does lead to an awful lot of common functions.
Do you have any other feelings on the subject?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: I was one of the main proponents of
including the STL into the standard library. I consider the generic-container-plus-iterators
approach an elegant resolution of the problems with older approaches. Chapter 16
of my 3rd edition (the first of the standard library chapters) explains this in some
detail. Basically, the STL approach allows us to use simple, optimal, type-safe containers
while still being able to write code that can be used for a wide variety of containers.
For example, the same traversal algorithm can be applied to both a vector and a list
without imposing virtual function overheads on the access to elements.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">By &quot;an awful lot of common functions&quot;
do you mean code-replication overhead or the need to provide a large set of functions
for every container? Code replication can be designed away and I don't think that
writing a standards-conforming container is more work that writing any other &quot;industrial
strength&quot; container. The key savings comes when we don't have to replicate algorithms
for each container. Also, where close-to-optimal efficiency isn't required, we can
simply build a &quot;traditional&quot; container class that meet the standard's container
requirements and then use inheritance based on that one.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: I was thinking of the difference
between using base class methods for commonality of algorithm and general methods
verses generic functions, where the primary difference seems to be whether the algorithm
is in a common base class or in a function. I think the idea is the same but the
structuring is different. The approaches seem equivalent. I believe the inheritance
approach could be categorized as the Template Pattern, which is perhaps my favorite,
typically for frameworks.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Do you think tasking (or threads) belong
in a programming language? Can I presume they were left out of C++ to provide users
with a choice on the model to employ?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: You are exactly right. I knew too many
reasonable models for concurrrency to feel comfortable with building a single one
into C++. Some people want non-preemptive threads for the most efficient and more
basic concurrency, others want pre-emptable threads, others still want full-blown
processes, and yet others want a concurrency mechanism that guarantees the integrity
of transactions across a distributed system. I would have liked to serve them all
by including a set of fundamental concurrency mechanisms that could serve as a basis
for several forms of concurrency in C++. However, I never found a set that I felt
could serve most of the C++ community well.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">The result has been that there is a number
of competing concurrency models for C++. See for example <I>Parallel Programming

concurrency in C++.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO:</B> Thanks for the reference. Again
its technological distinctiveness will be added to the Object FAQ. Java has single
inheritance and multiple interface inheritance, while C++ has multiple inheritance
(and abstract classes) which is a combination of typing and representation. I've
even heard, much to my dismay, that multiple inheritance is being taught as a bad
idea in school today and I've talked to architects who believe multiple inheritance
causes maintenance problems as parent classes evolve apart over time. What do you
think about all of this?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: Every useful/powerful feature can be
misused, and every feature not present in a language tends to be deemed &quot;dangerous&quot;
by proponents of that language. You can write lousy programs using multiple inheritance,
just as you can write lousy programs with single inheritance and without inheritance.
However, when your problem naturally maps to multiple inheritance, you get the maintenance
problems by using only single inheritance or no inheritance. Basically, when you
need multiple inheritance, you use it or you write a mess of forwarding functions.
The exact same statement applies to single inheritance.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">I use multiple inheritance in about a dozen
places in my 3rd edition. I don't make a big deal out of it, because it's really
quite simple.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">The Java designers decided to provide only
a crippled form of multiple inheritance. That's their choice and it may make sense
in their world, but there are places where I prefer multiple inheritance to all alternatives
I know of in the context of C++ and the kinds of problems I think most about -- and
those problems tend to require a combination of long-term maintainability and high
efficiency.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: I agree completely. Java has pointer
semantics and C++ has objects and pointers. While the Java model is simpler, it expands
on the error of not allocating an object to a reference. Personally, I've advocated
recursive types as a better theoretical approach, although it makes pointers implicit.
What do you think?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: I think pointers have had a bad press
lately. In theory, we might be able to do without pointers, but in real-world software
we don't seem to be able to. Using a different name for &quot;pointer&quot; doesn't
help much.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">When you want to point to an element, a
pointer is a perfectly good construct. I think a lot of the problems come from messing
around with pointers at a very low level -- such as a C-style string or a linked
list where the programmer has to manipulate the links directly. The string and the
containers and algorithms in the C++ standard library ought to help here. Low-level
pointer manipulation can be eliminated from most code written by novices and casual
programmers. Personally, I am suspicious of any piece of code that uses a pointer
to pointer directly.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: I agree. I believe high-level structures,
especially with the help of generic collection classes, should almost always replace
pointers in code. Java has a small reflection package in 1.1: Have you ever considered
adding reflection to C++?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: Often. However, I have not seen an
approach to full reflection directly supported by a language that didn't cause serious
overheads. Also, reflection seems to encourage styles of programming that make it
hard to determine what's going on from the source text and discourage static checking.
I see that as a problem. Consequently, the C++ RTTI provides only the minimal information
to determine the types of objects at run time. Where necessary, this can be used
as a handle for more information about types (classes), but any such information
is beyond what the standard guarantees.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: I agree completely that strong
static typing handles many, if not most, cases. Like other advanced techniques, I
see dynamic typing/dynamic reflection as rather advanced in principle and when called
for provides a simpler solution than using idioms when dynamic facilities aren't
present (it must be done regardless or a less than optimal model employed). But like
anything else, dynamics can be over, or inappropriately, used.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Last I heard, about 30-40% of all first
semester CS courses had adopted C++ for a programming language. Do you have any new
statistics? And do you know what percentage of the professional software development
community is using C++? I'd guess it's not too far from the dominant position of
Microsoft operating systems or Intel CPUs.</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: I don't know the number of C++ programmers
and I don't know the number of programmers, but yes, C++ seems to be in a very prominent
position among builders of significant systems -- as opposed [to its position] among
builders of small applications. With the prominence comes an opportunity and an obligation
to teach C++ and the techniques it supports well. C++ often is used in ways that
are severely sub-optimal. Writing C or Smalltalk using C++ syntax is rarely a great
improvement over alternatives.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Thus, teaching C++ well is very important.
Different categories of programmers need different approaches. For example, someone
who has never programmed before needs a different approach from a C programmer trying
to add techniques to his repertoire, and the C programmer again needs a different
approach from someone approaching C++ from a Pascal/Ada background.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">In all cases, though, I encourage an approach
based on an emphasis on strong static typing and abstraction techniques. I consider
a heavy early emphasis on C or on class hierarchies problematic. There is a lot of
mileage to be had out of strong static type checking and out of concrete and abstract
classes before heading into the trickier parts of the common subset of C and C++
or the trickier parts of object-oriented programming.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: Mike Spertus wrote an article appearing
in this issue about coding Java in C++ by only using a simple subset of C++ that
can be easily translated to Java. This code would then be portable and would also
satisfy the boss who wants code written in C++. Further, the idea (one that Mike
wrote about in a previous <I>Object Currents</I> column) is that applications should
only use simple language constructs anyway and leave the more complex ones, such
as operator overloading, to utilities and libraries to keep applications from becoming
obscure. What do you think? Mike also believes garbage collection is better in C++
because of greater development maturity and flexibility in choosing packages. Do
you agree with him?</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: Hmmm. It seems to me that C++ is a
perfectly good garbage-collected language, but I haven't gathered enough personal
experience with garbage-collected C++ to give detailed recommendations. If you want
a garbage collector for C++, there are good ones available -- both free and commercially
supported.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">Garbage collection for idiomatic C++ is
efficient because there is less garbage to collect than there would be in traditional
garbage-collected languages that allocate everything in a heap (e.g., Lisp, Smalltalk,
Java). C++ garbage collectors also have the advatage of handling garbage created
by the C parts of a program.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">It should also be remembered that the standard
library containers manage memory for their elements. This means that you can reduce
the amount of explicit memory management radically even without a garbage collector.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">I consider it obvious that relatively inexperienced
C++ programmers should try to avoid trickier parts of the language. However, I see
no point in scaring the majority of programmers away from large parts of the language.
For example, when used with caution, operator overloading is quite simple and very
useful. That doesn't mean that writing a matrix algebra library is a good choice
as a first C++ project. That's an area where getting one of the available matrix
libraries and concentrating on learning it well is a good idea.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">However, restricting oneself to the C subset
of C++ or the Java-like subset of C++ is a bad idea for most programmers. For starters,
unless you use templates, you'll have to write code that's far less type safe. The
presence of casts (explicit type conversion) in a program -- outside small well-delimited
areas -- is a sign of poor design. Most application code should need only a few casts,
and libraries that force their user to use casts are not taking advantage of modern
C++. Where a language mechanism fits a problem, avoiding that language feature simply
forces the complexity it would have helped manage into the user code.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>OMO: Good points: I've made the same
argument about using sophisticated features where appropriate to simplify programming
and to avoid the Turing Tarpit. This seems to be the same as the multiple inheritance
issue (and also my reflection issue, too).</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">BS: C++ is a language you can grow with.
I don't think that the fact that you can't master it and its key techniques in a
week or a month is a reason for complaints. Most of the complexity is there to make
life simpler for you when you need them. Importantly, C++ can be learned in stages
and at least most of what you don't know won't hurt you.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial, Helvetica">D&amp;E is my explanation of what C++ is
and why. My 3rd is my current best attempt to show how C++ can be learned and used;
it is foreward-looking in that it depends on and explains features of Standard C++
that are only just becoming available. I think the best has yet to come.</FONT></P>
