    made after using the browser Back or Forward buttons on your top toolbar 
    were not recorded unless you next clicked the Confirm or Next buttons etc on

    issued, together with any changes in the insurance terms and/or premium. <b>
    Failure to notify us of any errors, omissions or amendments could result in

    <p><font color="#003399" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">Insurers pass information to the <b>Claims 
    and Underwriting Exchange Register</b>, run by Insurance Database Services 
    Ltd (IDS Ltd) and the <b>Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register</b>, 
    run by the Association of British Insurers (ABI). The aim is to help us to 
    check information provided and also to prevent fraudulent claims. <b>When we 
    deal with your request for insurance, we may search these registers.</b> 
    Under the conditions of your policy, you must tell us about any incident 
    (such as accident or theft) which may or may not give rise to a claim. <b>
    When you tell us about an incident, we will pass information relating to it 
    to the registers.</b> Your insurance cover details will be added to the <b>
    Motor Insurance Database</b>, run by the Motor Insurers' Information Centre 
    (MIIC). This has been set up to help identify uninsured drivers, and may be 
    searched by the Police to confirm who is insured to drive. If there is an 
    accident, the Database may be used by Insurers, MIIC and the Motor Insurers' 
    Bureau to identify relevant policy information. You can ask for more 
    information about this. You should show this notice to anyone insured to 
    drive the vehicle covered under the policy.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#003399" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">To provide enhanced customer service and

    that we already hold and may receive now and in the future as well as 
    information about lapsed policies) may be held on a group database operated 
    by your Insurer and may be shared with other companies associated with your 
    Insurer. This will allow your Insurer to reflect all the connections that 
    you have with the Insurer’s group. They may disclose your information to 
    agents and service providers appointed by them (such as loss adjusters, 
    approved contractors, market research and quality assurance companies). Your 
    information will be used for general insurance administration purposes. It 
    may also be used for offering renewal, research and statistical purposes and 
    for crime prevention. Your Insurer may also transfer your information to any 
    country including countries outside the European Economic Area for any of 
    these purposes and for system administration.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#003399" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">The Data Protection Act 1998 defines

    this quotation is true and complete. I understand that it is my duty to 
    disclose all facts that are material to and will influence the acceptance 
    and assessment of the proposal and that I must notify immediately any 
    changes to the information provided herein. I understand that failure to do 
    so means that the policy may not operate to protect me. I further understand 
    that at each renewal of my policy it is my duty to disclose any change to 
    the information provided by me and any other facts which are material to and 
    will influence the acceptance and assessment of the Insurer’s renewal 
    invitation. I understand that you will pass the information provided by me 
    and about any incident I may give details of to IDS Ltd and the ABI so that 
    they can make it available to other Insurers. I also understand that, in 
    response to any searches you may make in connection with this application or

    <p><font color="#003399" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">We cannot stress too strongly the 
    importance of full disclosure when proposing for, or renewing, any insurance 
    policy. Even an innocent omission of a single speeding offence a few years 
    ago could result in Insurers refusing to pay a claim if they would not have 
    accepted the risk in full knowledge.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#003399" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><b>Law to be applied</b></font></p>
    <p><font color="#003399" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">The parties are free to choose the law

    <p><font color="#003399" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><b>Cancellation</b></font></p>
    <p><font color="#003399" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">Practices vary between insurers, but be 
    aware that cancellation refunds are not given after a claim, and otherwise 
    calculated on a short period scale weighted in favour of the insurer as 
    their costs are similar whether a policy has run for one month or twelve. We 
    do not refund commission, since this was earned for arranging the policy 
    (unless you are replacing the policy through our Agency). Instalment charges 
    are not refunded.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#003399" size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><b>Our charges</b></font></p>

    that may be caused due to equipment and electrical items being unable to 
    recognise certain dates, which may result in failure or breakdown.Insurance 
    policies have never been intended to cover items that simply breakdown or 
    fail to work and failure to handle a date correctly is an example. An
