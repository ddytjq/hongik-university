<h3><font color="#0000FF">Interviewing for Your First Coaching Job?</font></h3>

<p>Notice: This article was written by&nbsp; Kevin Reilly and Steve Jordan, <a href="akcoach.com">Coach's
Notebook. </a>Email the author at <a href="mailto:sjordan@alaskalife.net.">sjordan@alaskalife.net.</a></p>

<p>I had the pleasure of interviewing for a head coaching job. I thought I would share the 
experience with you and offer some suggestions. Perhaps I should not be giving advice as I did 
not get the job, but I did learn a lot. Maybe you will be more successful. The last part of 
the article shows my responses if you're interested. The interview was oral, so my responses 
here are made with 20-20 hindsight... more like this is what I wish I said!</p>

<p>

<b>Suggestions</b>
<ol>
  <li>Men, dress nicely to show respect for the job and the people taking the time to interview you. 
Slacks, coat and tie should be appropriate. Ladies ... you know better than me.<br><br></li>
  <li>Speak clearly and personably. Look everyone in the eye and be conversational.
If you're nervous, that's normal. Take your time. It will really help if you're prepared. 
Try to anticipate some questions that may be asked and have solid answers ready.<br><br></li>
<li>Remember to put the kids first. Sure, you are interviewing for your job, but the whole 
point is to help students. If that is your motive, it will show through. If you are worried about 
money, your win/loss record, your history as a player... that will show through, too.<br><br></li>
  <li>Don't be afraid to deviate from the script if you sense an important issue. Perhaps they are 
looking for someone who is bold and willing to share opinions. <br><br></li>
  <li>Do not denigrate the other candidates or the previous coach. You will appear negative and mean. 
This is an important job that needs a positive person. <br><br></li>
  <li>Ask the chief interviewer what he/she is looking for in a successful candidate.<br><br></li>
  <li>If you don't get the job, don't doubt yourself. There may have been a wide range of characteristics 
that were considered. Maybe the things you're best at weren't the most important for this 
particular position. Maybe the other candidates are very good, too. <br><br></li>
  <li>If unsuccessful, be graceful. Don't bad mouth the new coach, the process or the administration. 
If you still want to be a part of the program, try to help in a different way.<br><br></li>
</ol>

</ol>

<p><b>My Answers</b> (Your answers will differ!)</p>
<ol>
<li>I am in my third year of coaching 9-10th graders as a volunteer coach for the High School 
C Team. I also assist with the Junior Varsity players. I am in my 12th year of coaching players 
(from 4th grade to 12th grade) in the YMCA and other youth leagues as a mean of preparing them to play in high 
school competition. I have also coached several high school aged baseball teams.<br><br></li>
<li>I have 20 years of formal supervisory experience working in the petroleum industry. I have been 
trained to manage large projects, supervise adults teams in company operations and administer budgetary 
and personnel duties. Managing assistant coaches will be similar to my work experience with adults. I will measure 
assistant coaches on their ability to teach fundamental skills, promote good team morale, employ 
full participation of all players, foster good sportsmanship and developing team skills in which 
all members of the group work together to create and achieve something better than their 
individual potentials.<br><br></li>
<li>Practice is the classroom; the game is the test. We learn what we need to improve from the games. 
Record keeping is essential. From the records - shot charts and videotapes - players will 
learn the value of their decisions on the floor. In practice, we will learn to perform necessary 
skills to win and develop the understanding behind our strategies so there is no confusion in 
purpose in competition. While practices are planned and structured well in advance, flexibility 
is important to make adjustments as the team develops.<br><br></li>
<li>I would plan to retain 36 players in the program. There may be circumstances to consider an 
extra player (a 13th team member) in extenuating situations, but 12 per team is the ideal number to 
provide adequate playing time and have sufficient reserves for injury or sickness. The varsity is for 
the most experienced and talented players. In a talent rich environment like our high school, each year 
should have a new crop of seniors that have grown up through the program and are prepared for 
their year of leadership. Some juniors may be experienced and talented enough for varsity competition, 
but I adamantly oppose placing freshmen on the varsity team, and would only consider a sophomore in the 
most extraordinary cases. There is great value in allowing talented underclassmen grow up together, 
learning to work together, being successful together ... instead of sitting on the varsity bench 
for a couple years. <br><br>It will be tough selling this approach to the talented kids and their parents, 
but in a school with championship potential, people need to accept the long term value of growing 
through the program. Expecting to be a varsity star for 4 years is small school mentality. Players 
should take great pride in being a member of the C team or JV team. If they cannot, then how can 
they learn the depth of sacrifice needed to create a championship program? Players cut from the 
program should be told where they fell short, encouraged to improve and try out again next year. Such 
players are welcome in the spring and fall youth leagues.<br><br></li>
<li>C team members must practice right after school due to the difficulty in arranging 
transportation. JV players can go after school or evening. Varsity teams should have the evening slots 
as most of the kids can drive themselves. Consideration should be given to coaches working outside 
the school for evening practice times.<br><br></li>
<li>Once the teams are selected, a meeting with all the parents is crucial. In that meeting, the head 
coach must describe many things: coaching philosophy, discipline, expectations of behavior and performance, 
schedules, trip plans, etc. In addition, parents must be recruited to assist with the many supportive 
activities needed for a viable basketball program: fundraising, statistics, videotaping, publicity, 
web presence, trip planning, chaperones, booster club, etc. <br><br> At the end of the season, 
time and effort should be put into an awards/recognition banquet as well as a huge thank you to 
the parents. <br><br>In between those two events, though, it would be wise to have one or two 
mid-season meetings, either on a program wide basis or at least on a per team basis, so that 
the coaches can review progress and answer questions from parents.<br><br> Parents should be welcome 
to attend practices as spectators. There are no secrets to hide. Parents may get a better understanding 
of what the team objectives are. Such knowledge would make the games much more interesting. Further, 
the parents could better exercise their role of reinforcing the coaching direction rather than 
second guessing the coach at home. Further, I encourage parental input, even on game strategy. Sometimes, 
parents have wonderfully insightful things to say. Why miss out on that?<br><br></li>
<li>While I like to build teams through consensus, once we establish direction, everyone needs 
to support that direction. I would build consensus for the program direction with my coaches, then 
expect their complete support. I would describe our direction to parents, listen to their concerns 
if any, then expect their complete support. Lastly, the players will be expected to learn the 
direction under the guidance of the coaches and the support of the parents. The idea is to have 
one team, one direction. The team includes players, coaches, parents and administration.<br><br>
Coaches are expected to have differing viewpoints. Discussion and debate should be encouraged. But 
once the consensus is established, everyone is 100% committed to making that direction succeed. 
Parents, players, or even coaches that cannot support the direction through their teaching and 
comments clearly do not want to be part of the team.<br><br></li>
<li>Additional team rules should be minimal. I like &quot;Respect yourself, your team and your opponents 
and do nothing to harm that respect&quot;. It is so much more encompassing than a laundry list of
 do this and don't do that. Its all about respect for one another.<br><br></li>
 <li>There is one thing that all players value. It can be the most effective motivator. That thing is 
 playing time. Players who are disrespectful should lose playing time privileges. The amount of 
 time should correspond with the degree of seriousness of the situation. When I have had disruptive 
 players in practice, I excuse them. They can watch quietly, or go home. If the instance is 
 bad enough, a player may sit out a game. If the player cannot conform after this level of 
 discipline, the parents may be consulted. If the parents are &quot;on the team&quot;, then they will 
 help bring the player around. If they are not &quot;on the team&quot;, they will side with the player. That's 
 why it is so important to have the scope of the team enlarged to its bigger family. Discipline must 
 be perceived as fair to all members. If &quot;star&quot; players receive preferential treatment, team 
 morale will collapse and teamwork objectives will be severely compromised.<br><br></li>
 <li>It takes a lot of committed people to raise funds. I propose a parent led committee that 
 will stump for funds, organize fund raisers and supervise students who are performing fund 
 raising services. The head coach should be involved, but not as the chair. The committee needs 
 a responsible treasurer to record transactions. If the coach holds the check book, the monies 
 will be suspect. Disputes over money have led to many coaches' downfall.<br><br></li>
 <li>Criticism comes with the job. However, if the coach is successful building consensus and 
 enlisting parents as team members, there will be few to criticize. People don't criticize
 programs they are trying make successful. Further, with everyone working, this adage holds 
 true: &quot;You can't rock the boat if you're too busy rowing!&quot; A coach that communicates with the 
 parents will diffuse much criticism. If the parents have a chance to express concerns, 
 chances are their needs will be met. Its when they do not understand what is happening or feel 
 they have no voice that the criticisms get out of hand.<br><br></li>
 <li>Safety is major concern for any program. Players should be taught proper skills and techniques 
 to avoid injury. Conditioning in practices should be not be overdone to the point where 
 players are getting hurt. This is especially true early in the season when muscles are 
 tight and sore. Conditioning is critical to a competitive program, but it can be destructive 
 if overdone. The playing environment must be free of obstacles and clean of debris. The 
 players can devote a few minutes each day to policing the area and sweeping the floor.<br><br></li>
 <li>Why am I the best candidate for this position? This answer should come from heart of 
 every applicant and should be very personal and individually expressed. For me, my best 
 attributes are drawing energy and ideas from people around me, committing fully to team goals and 
 depending upon teaching sound fundamental skills and building character to achieve success. I 
 believe that some players are more gifted than others, but if they are weak in character or 
 are unskilled in the sport, then success will not be realized - only failed expectations. 
 I like to help basketball players learn the sport from the ground up, understanding the 
 purpose of their actions, learning to make advantageous decisions, accepting the consequences 
 of calculated risks and accepting responsibility for their actions, favorable or not. I want 
 to coach a team of respectful people, people who enjoy one another's company and who think 
 positively about their school and community. I want people to look at our team and think - 
 those kids have class - those kids have poise. Ultimately, I want people to wish their kids 
 could be in our program more than any other. This is the kind of basketball program I want 
 to work for. If I can't be the best candidate, then it is my hope these values will be 
 promoted at this high school.<br><br></li>
 <li>Coaches who work regular jobs may have a tough time meeting a 2:30PM practice time. If this 
 is a problem, speak up. Don't put yourself in a position where you are responsible for 
 kids and you can't show up.<br><br></li>
 <li>Why coach if you can't attend tournaments or travel? A necessary question, I guess.<br><br></li>

<h1>Making it to the Sidelines: Landing a Job in Coaching</h1>
<p><i>contributed by Kevin Reilly</i></p>
<p>In a highly competitive job market, preparation, patience and a positive
attitude all play a role in obtaining a coaching position at the high school or
college level.</p>
<p>Nowadays, a college degree is a necessity for almost every line of work, and
coaching is no different. So hit the books and get yourself a degree. In
particular, majors such as physical education, secondary education or a minor in
coaching preparation are a common ground for successful coaches.</p>
<p>A graduate degree is often necessary at the college level and won't hurt at
the scholastic level. While in grad school, pursuing an opportunity to work in
the athletic program as a graduate-assistant coach is one of the most effective
things you can do in chasing your dream. While acquiring a master's degree at
Springfield College I was fortunate to coach junior varsity basketball under Dr.
Ed Bilik (who is now the rules interpreter for the NCAA).</p>
<p>Some other things that can help you in your pursuit of a coaching job is
experience as a player, being a team manager of your college team, studying the
x's and o's of your particular sport, and most importantly, summer camp work.</p>
<p>After college, I spent every summer traveling the northeastern United States
and got the opportunity to learn from such coaches as PJ Carlesimo, Rick Pitino,
Don Nelson, Jeff Van Gundy and even some lesser-known coaches as Brian Hammel
(now head coach of Northern Illinois) and Gordon Chiesa (Assistant Coach, Utah
Jazz).</p>
<p>You can learn from everyone, pick coaches brains and develop your style and
philosophy. Networking and getting to meet people in the coaching profession can
help you immensely. The old adage is often true &quot;It's who you know not what
you know that can help you.&quot;</p>
<p>Have confidence in your abilities and stick to your philosophy. Be prepared
for different situations on and off the court or field. Some coaches have stated
that they were &quot;born&quot; to coach. Don't let them fool you. It takes a
lot of work.</p>
<p>I remember working a basketball camp with Jeff Van Gundy when he was a high
school coach and less than 10 years later he was the head coach of the N.Y.
Knicks, How did he get there? By networking, studying the game, and most
importantly, working his tail off.</p>
<p>Who knows? Perhaps what happened to him can happen to you.</p>
