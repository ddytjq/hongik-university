<h3>Background</h3>

<img src="./graphics/refsys.gif" align="right" width=262 height=175 hspace=5 vspace=5>
<p>The ICRS is a means of realizing a space-fixed (quasi-inertial) coordinate
system on the sky by defining a set of suitable benchmark objects,
specifying the precise coordinates for each one, and providing standard
models and algorithms that allow these coordinates to be transformed
into observable quantities for any epoch.</p>

<p>In this context is useful to distinguish between <i>reference
system</i> and a <i>reference frame</i>.  A <i>reference system</i> is
the complete specification of how a celestial coordinate system is to be
formed.  It defines the origin and fundamental planes (or axes) of
the coordinate system.  It also specifies all of the constants, models, and
algorithms used to transform between observable quantities and reference
data that conform to the system.

<p>A <i>reference frame</i> consists of a set of identifiable fiducial
points on the sky along with their coordinates, which serves as the
practical realization of a reference system.  Most commonly, a reference
frame consists of a catalog of precise positions (and motions, if
measurable) of stars or extragalactic objects as seen from the solar
system barycenter at a specific epoch (now usually "J2000.0", which is
12h&nbsp;TT on 1&nbsp;January 2000).  If we consider ordinary celestial
equatorial coordinates - right ascension and declination - then each
<img src="./graphics/RA_Dec.gif" align="left" width=305 height=180 hspace=5 vspace=5>
object's instantaneous position indicates the object's distance from
the catalog's equator and origin of right ascension.  Any two such
objects in the catalog therefore uniquely orient a spherical coordinate
system on the sky - a reference frame.

<p>A modern astrometric catalog contains data on a large number of
objects (N), so the coordinate system is vastly overdetermined.  The
quality of the reference frame defined by a catalog depends on the
extent to which the coordinates of all possible pairs of objects
(~N<sup>2</sup>/2) serve to define the identical equator and right
ascension origin, within the expected random errors.  In practice, of
course, the reference frame is implemented at the time of actual
observations, and this requires the computation of the coordinates of
the catalog objects at arbitrary dates and times.  The proper motions of
the objects (unless assumed zero) are an essential factor in this
computation.  Because proper motions are never perfect (even if assumed
zero), any celestial reference frame deteriorates with time.  Moreover,
systematic errors in the proper motions can produce spurious rotations
in the frame.  Therefore, the accuracy and consistency of the proper
motions are critical to the overall quality, utility, and longevity of
the reference frame.</p>

<p>A reference frame can also be defined by an ephemeris (table of
coordinates as a function of time) of one or more solar system bodies;
this is called a <i>dynamical reference frame</i>.  Dynamical reference
frames are unique in that they can provide the locations of both the
equator and the ecliptic on the sky, and thus fix the position of the
equinox, the fundamental origin of right ascension.  They have therefore
been used to properly align star catalog reference frames (the star
positions were systematically adjusted) on the basis of simultaneous
observations of stars and planets.  However, dynamical reference frames
are not very practical for establishing a coordinate system for
day-to-day astronomical observations.  The ICRS does not involve a
dynamical reference frame.</p>

<p>Descriptions of reference frames and reference systems often refer
to three coordinate axes, which are simply the set of right-handed
cartesian axes that correspond to the usual celestial spherical
coordinate system.  The xy-plane is the equator, the z-axis points
toward the north celestial pole, and the x-axis points toward the origin
of right ascension.  Although in principle this allows us to specify the
position of any celestial object in rectangular coordinates, the
distance scale is not established to high precision beyond the solar
system.  What a reference system actually defines is the way in which
the two conventional astronomical <i>angular</i> coordinates, right
ascension and declination, overlay real observable fiducial points in
the sky.</p>

<br>



<a name="RDEV"></a>
<h3>Recent Developments</h3>

<p>The establishment of celestial reference systems is coordinated
by the <a href="http://www.iau.org/" target="_top">International
Astronomical Union (IAU)</a>.  The previous
astronomical reference system was based on the equator
and equinox determined from observations of planetary motions, together
with the IAU (1976) System of Astronomical Constants and related
algorithms <a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#1">[1]</a>.  The reference
frame that embodied this system for practical purposes was the
<a href="http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/adc-cgi/cat.pl?/catalogs/1/1149A/"
target="_top">Fifth Fundamental Catalogue (FK5)</a>
<a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#2">[2]</a>.  The FK5 is a
catalog of 1535 bright stars (to magnitude 7.5), supplemented by a
fainter extension of 3117 additional stars (to magnitude 9.5).  The FK5
was the successor to the FK3 and FK4 catalogs, all compiled from
catalogs of meridian observations taken in the visual band
(many such observations were, in fact, taken by eye).  The formal
uncertainties in the star positions of the FK5 at the time of its
(somewhat delayed) publication in 1988 were about 30-40 milliarcseconds over
most of the sky, but the errors are considerably worse when systematic
trends are taken into account.</p>

<p>In recent years, the most precise wide-angle (global)
astrometry has been conducted not in the optical regime but at
radio wavelengths, involving the techniques of
<a href="http://hpiers.obspm.fr/webiers/general/iersq/organisation/coord/VLBI.html"
target="_top">Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)</a> and
pulsar timing.  Uncertainties of radio
<img src="./graphics/VLBI_antenna.jpg" align="left" width=219 height=165 hspace=5 vspace=5>
source positions listed in all-sky VLBI catalogs are now typically
less than one milliarcsecond, and often a factor of ten better.
Furthermore, because these radio sources are very distant
extragalactic objects (mostly quasars) that are not expected to
show measurable intrinsic motion, a reference frame defined by VLBI
positions should be "more inertial" (less subject to spurious rotation)
than a reference frame defined by galactic objects such as stars or
pulsars.  The VLBI catalogs do have the disadvantage that their origin
of right ascension is somewhat arbitrary; there is no real equinox in
VLBI catalogs, since VLBI has little sensitivity to the ecliptic plane.
However, this problem has turned out to be more conceptual than
practical, since methods have been developed to relate the VLBI right
ascension origin to the equinox as conventionally defined.</p>

<p>Because of these considerations, since the mid 1980s,
astronomical measurements of the Earth's rotation - from which astronomical
time is determined - have depended heavily on VLBI, with classical
methods based on star transits being phased out.  Hence the
situation evolved where the definition of the fundamental
astronomical reference frame (the FK5) became irrelevant to some
of the most precise and important astrometric measurements.  VLBI
revealed, in addition, that the models of the Earth's precession
and nutation that were part of the old system were inadequate for
modern astrometric precision.  In particular, the "constant of
precession" - a measurement of the long-term rate of change of the
orientation of the Earth's axis in space - had been overestimated
by about 0.3 arcseconds per century.  Moreover, the success of the
European Space Agency
<a href="http://astro.estec.esa.nl/Hipparcos/" target="_top">Hipparcos
astrometric satellite</a>, launched in 1989, promised to provide a new,
very accurate set of star coordinates in the optical regime.  Thus,
beginning in 1988, a number of IAU working groups began considering the
requirements for a new fundamental astronomical reference system
<a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#3">[3]</a>
<a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#4">[4]</a>.  The resulting series of
IAU resolutions, passed in 1991, 1994, and 1997
<a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#5">[5]</a>
<a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#6">[6]</a>
<a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#7">[7]</a>, effectively form the
specifications for the ICRS.</p>

<br>



<a name="IMPL"></a>
<h3>ICRS Implementation</h3>

<p><i>The Defining Extragalactic Frame</i></p>

<p>The
<a href="http://hpiers.obspm.fr/webiers/results/icrf/readme.html"
target="_top"><i>International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF)</i></a>
is a catalog of adopted positions of 608 extragalactic radio sources
observed with VLBI, all strong (>0.1&nbsp;Jy) at S and X
bands (wavelengths 13 and 3.6 cm) <a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#8">[8]</a>.
Most have faint optical counterparts (typically m<sub>V</sub>>18) and
the majority are quasars.  Of these objects, 212 are <i>defining sources</i>
that establish the orientation of the <i>ICRS axes</i>,
with origin at the solar system barycenter.  Typical
position uncertainties for the defining sources are of order 0.5
milliarcsecond; the orientation of the axes are defined from the
ensemble to an accuracy of about 0.02 milliarcseconds.   As described
below, these axes correspond closely to what would conventionally be
described as "the equator and equinox of J2000.0".
</p>

<p><i>The Frame at Optical Wavelengths</i></p>

<p>The ICRS is realized at optical wavelengths by the
<a href="http://astro.estec.esa.nl/Hipparcos/catalog.html"
target="_top">Hipparcos Catalogue</a> of 118,218 stars, some
as faint as visual magnitude 12 <a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#9">[9]</a>.
The Hipparcos coordinates and proper motions are
given within the ICRS (J2000.0) coordinate system but are listed
for epoch J1991.25.  (That is, the catalog effectively represents
a snapshot of the motion of the stars through space taken on
2&nbsp;April 1991.)  At the catalog epoch, Hipparcos uncertainties
for stars brighter than 9th magnitude have median values
somewhat better than 1&nbsp;milliarcsecond in position and
1&nbsp;milliarcsecond/year in proper motion <a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#9">[9]</a>
<a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#10">[10]</a>.  Thus, projected to
epoch J2000.0, typical Hipparcos star position errors can be expected
to be in the range 5-10 milliarcseconds.</p>

<p><i>Standard Algorithms</i></p>

<p>The set of models and algorithms that are used to transform ICRS
catalog data to observable quantities (and vice versa) are given in the
<a href="http://maia.usno.navy.mil/conventions.html" target="_top">IERS
Conventions (1996)</a> <a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#11">[11]</a>.
Numerical values for fundamental astronomical constants are also
listed.  This publication does not, however, include some
algorithms required for optical observations; these may be found
in Volumes 1 and 3 of the Hipparcos Catalogue documentation
<a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#9">[9]</a>.  Kaplan has numerically
compared some of the algorithms (those involving relativity) used in
radio and optical data analysis and found good consistency despite very
different paradigms <a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#12">[12]</a>.</p>

<p>It should be noted that some of the material in the IERS
Conventions document is provisional.  For example, a new model of
precession/nutation will be developed by the time of the next IAU
General Assembly in 2000.  Consideration is also being given to the
adoption of a new set of transformations that describe the
instantaneous orientation of the Earth in space.  Changes to the
values of some of the astronomical constants can also be
anticipated.</p>

<p>However, for applications requiring accuracies of no better than
50 milliarcseconds between about 1990 and 2010, the
algorithms described in Chapter 3 of the
<a href="http://www.uscibooks.com/seid.htm" target="_top"><i>Explanatory
Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac</i></a>
<a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#13">[13]</a> can still be used.  See also
the <a href="./software/novas/novas_info.html">NOVAS</a> software
package, which implements these algorithms.</p>

<p><i>Relationship to Other Systems</i></p>

<p>The orientation of the ICRS axes is consistent with the equator and
equinox of J2000.0 represented by the FK5, within the errors of the latter.
Since the errors of the FK5 at J2000.0 are significantly worse than
those of Hipparcos at the same epoch, the ICRS can be considered to be a
refinement of the FK5 system <a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#9">[9]</a>.

<p>The ICRS system can also be considered to be a good
approximation (at least as good as the FK5) to the conventionally
defined dynamical equator and equinox of J2000.0
<a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#14">[14]</a>.  In fact, the equator is well
determined fundamentally from the VLBI observations that are the basis for
the entire ICRS system.  The zero point of VLBI right ascensions is
arbitrary, but has been set by assigning to the right ascension of
source 3C&nbsp;273B a value derived from lunar occultation timings -
the Moon's ephemeris thus providing an indirect link to the
dynamical equinox.  The ICRS origin of right ascension has been
independently estimated by Folkner and colleagues to lie about 78
milliarcseconds from the dynamical equinox defined by the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory DE-200 ephemeris
<a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#15">[15]</a>.</p>

<p>Because of its consistency with previous reference systems,
implementation of the ICRS system will be transparent to many
applications - all those with accuracy requirements of no better
than 50 milliarcseconds near epoch J2000.0.

<p><i>ICRS Overview Paper</i></p>

<p>Feissel and Mignard have written a good, concise review of the
ICRS adoption and its implications <a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#14">[14]</a>.
Their paper contains technical details and references not covered
here.</p>

<br>



<a name="DATA"></a>
<h3>Data in the ICRS System</h3>
<img src="./graphics/0241+622.jpg" align="right" space=5 vspace=5>

<p>As stated above, the
<a href="http://hpiers.obspm.fr/webiers/results/icrf/readme.html"
target="_top">ICRF</a> contains the positions of 608 extragalactic radio
sources, which includes the 212 defining sources.  All observational data
were part of a common catalog reduction <a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#8">[8]</a>
and thus the adopted coordinates of all the sources are in the ICRS system.
Of the 396 non-defining sources, 294 are <i>candidate sources</i> that do not
meet all of the accuracy and observing history requirements of the
defining sources but which may at some later time be added to the
defining list.  The remaining 102 <i>other sources</i> show
excess apparent position variation and are of lower astrometric
quality.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://astro.estec.esa.nl/Hipparcos/catalog.html"
target="_top">Tycho Catalogue</a> contains 1,052,031 stars observed with
the Hipparcos satellite's star mapper <a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#9">[9]</a>.
The Tycho Catalogue can be considered an extension of the Hipparcos
Catalogue that is more complete at magnitudes 8-11 but less accurate.
The astrometric accuracy varies strongly with magnitude, but the
median uncertainties of Tycho positions and proper motions are a
factor of 30 worse than those in the Hipparcos Catalogue.  The
large proper motion uncertainties make Tycho unsuitable for
precise astrometric work; projected to epoch J2000.0, most Tycho
star positions will be in error by several tenths of an arcsecond.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/act/act.html"
target="_top">ACT Reference Catalog</a>
<a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#16">[16]</a> of the U.S. Naval
Observatory combines the Tycho coordinates with those of the
<a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/ac/ac.html" target="_top">Astrographic
Catalogue (AC)</a>, a large photographic project carried out near the
beginning of the 20th century involving 20 observatories worldwide.
There are 988,758 stars observed at both epochs that form the ACT
Reference Catalog.  This catalog thus combines the accuracy of the
recent Tycho position measurements with proper motions derived from a
time baseline of almost a century.  The proper motion uncertainties are
typically about 3 milliarcseconds/year.  Projected to epoch J2000.0,
therefore, most ACT Reference Catalog star positions will be in error by
significantly less than 0.1 arcsecond.

<p>The Jet Propulsion Laboratory
<a href="http://www.willbell.com/software/jpl.htm" target="_top">DE405
and DE406 planetary/lunar ephemerides</a> have been aligned to the ICRS
system.  These ephemerides provide the positions and velocities of the nine
major planets and the Moon with respect to the solar system barycenter,
in rectangular coordinates.  The data is represented in Chebyshev
series form and Fortran subroutines are provided to read and
evaluate the series for any date and time.  DE405 spans the years
1600 to 2200; DE406 spans the years -3000 to +3000 with lower
precision.</p>

<h3>Authorizing Resolution</h3>

<p>The construction and implementation of the ICRS was authorized
and supported by the
<a href="http://www.iau.org/" target="_top">International
Astronomical Union (IAU)</a>.  Resolution B2 passed by the 23rd
General Assembly of the IAU in August 1997
<a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#7">[7]</a>
states that

<ul>
    <li>from 1 January 1998, the IAU celestial reference system
        shall be the International Celestial Reference System
        (ICRS) as specified in the 1991 IAU Resolution on reference
        frames and as defined by the International Earth Rotation
        Service (IERS);
    <li>the corresponding fundamental reference frame shall be the
        International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) constructed
        by the IAU Working Group on Reference Frames;
    <li>the Hipparcos Catalogue shall be the primary realization
        of the ICRS at optical wavelengths;
    <li>the IERS should take appropriate measures, in conjunction
        with the IAU Working Group on Reference Frames, to maintain
        the ICRF and its ties to the reference frames at other
        wavelengths.
</ul>

<p>The full text of the resolution, as well as that of related
resolutions of the 23rd IAU General Assembly, can be found on the
page of <a href="http://maia.usno.navy.mil/iauc19/iaures.html"
target="_top">IAU Resolutions</a> maintained by IAU Commission 19
(Rotation of the Earth).</p>

<p>The "1991 IAU Resolution on reference frames" referred to above
(passed by the 21st IAU General Assembly)
<a href="./faq/docs/ICRS_doc.html#5">[5]</a> recommended that an IAU
working group establish a list of extragalactic radio sources that
would be "candidates for primary sources defining the new
conventional reference frame." </p>
