<B> FIELD HOCKEY AND THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACK ON THE WTC IN NEW YORK</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="verdana,helvetica" SIZE="-1">
Following the tragic events in the United States, the
    US Field Hockey Women's National Team will not compete in the World Cup Qualifying
    Tournament, scheduled for Sept. 17-30, in Amiens/Abbeville, France. The U.S. team will,
    however, have the opportunity to qualify for the 2002 World Cup through a provision by the
    International Hockey Federation (FIH).
    <p>Facing what the FIH termed an &quot;impossible situation,&quot; the U.S.
    team will now be allowed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup in a best of three match series
    against the Qualifier's 7th place team. Originally, the top seven teams at the Qualifier
    were to earn a berth in the World Cup, scheduled for Nov. 26 - Dec. 8, 2002 in Perth,
    Australia.
    <p>&quot;Our hearts are still heavy over the events of this last
    week,&quot; said U.S. Field Hockey President, Sharon Taylor. &quot;I am very proud of the
    brave, young women on our team who were willing to participate under these most extreme
    circumstances. Obviously, this is not the way we want to qualify. Every player would have
    liked to settle it on the field. But given the circumstances with our inability to get to
    the event and the rules of the tournament, we have no alternative. The FIH has been very
    sensitive to our plight, and this allows us to protect our players, yet gives us the
    opportunity to qualify.&quot;
    <p>The closing of U.S. airports and subsequent cancellation of many
    international flights, grounded the U.S. team, and postponed its conditional arrival in
    France until midway through the first week of the tournament. According to FIH rules, a
    forfeit of a single match at the tournament would call for forfeiture of all tournament
    matches. Canada and Uruguay, the other two teams representing the Americas at the
    tournament, had arrived in Europe before Tuesday's tragic events.</font></p>
    <p>&quot;Despite every effort being made on the part of the U.S. Field
    Hockey Association, it is now clear that it is impossible for their team to compete in
    France,&quot; said FIH Hon. Secretary General Peter Cohen. &quot;Because of the
    extraordinary circumstances about this situation, the FIH believes that in the overall
    interests of hockey, it is only fair and just that the USA not be deprived of an
    opportunity to qualify for the World Cup despite their inability to compete in this
    tournament.&quot;
    <p>The FIH plan calls for the U.S. team to compete in a best-of-three game
    series against the seventh place finisher at the Qualifying Tournament. The team placing
    7th at the Qualifier will have the opportunity to propose the location of the series with
    the approval of the FIH. The series will be played in early 2002 and preferably before
    Feb. 28.
    <p>The U.S. had entered the Qualifying Tournament as the number two seed
    and was scheduled to compete in Pool B with Belgium, Canada, Japan, Lithuania, Malaysia,
    Russia and Scotland. The tournament's top seed, England is joined in Pool A with host
    France, India, Ireland, Kazakstan, Ukraine and Uruguay. Kenya dropped out of the
    tournament early last week for financial reasons.
    <p>U.S. coach Tracey Belbin's team scheduled to compete in the Qualifier
    included 1998 World Cup veterans Kate Barber (West Chester, Pa.), Tracey Fuchs (Ann Arbor,
    Mich.), Katie Kauffman (West Lawn, Pa.), Jill Reeve (Hoosick Falls, N.Y.) and Peggy
    Storrar (Mahopac, N.Y.), in addition to Natalie Dawson (Berlin, N.J.), Kelli Gannon
    (Escondido, Calif.), Tara Jelley (Greenfield, Mass.), Tracey Larson (Morrisville, Pa.),
    Carrie Lingo (Rehoboth Beach, Del.), Kristen McCann (Allentown, Pa.), Melanie Meerschwam
    (Amstelveen, The Netherlands), Kim Miller (Virginia Beach, Va.), Mimi Smith (Virginia
    Beach, Va.), Carla Tagliente (Cortland, N.Y.) and Amy Tran (Grantville, Pa.).<BR>

<B> A TALE OF TWO RIVALS: Wyoming Valley West HS &amp Lake Lehman HS</B></FONT><BR>by Jennifer Goodrich
<P>
If you are from the state of Pennsylvania, you know that you will not find more competitive field hockey programs than those at Wyoming Valley West High School and Lake Lehman High School.  Both programs have equally successful histories, including division championships, district championships and trips to the state tournament in their respective classes.<P>
Despite being in different classes, these two evenly matched field hockey powers square off each year and the result is often an overtime game.  In fact, these teams were so evenly matched in 1998 that their respective seasons were eerily similar:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>both teams ended their season placing 2nd in their division
<LI>both teams defeated the Division Championship to become District Champion
<LI>both teams advanced to the State Quarterfinals before losing to the eventual State Championship
<LI>both teams had the Division MVP
<LI>both coaches were named Coach of the Year
</UL>
As in the case with many athletic rivalries, one would think that the competitiveness of these programs would foster an intensive rivalry that extends off the playing field.  To the contrary, <B><I>Coach Linda Fithian</I></B> of Wyoming Valley West High School and <B><I>Coach Jean Lipski</I></B> of Lake Lehman High School have chosen to work together to teach their student-athletes that there is a lot more to the game of field hockey than what occurs on the playing field.<P>
Coach Fithian and Coach Lipski work daily to convey to their athletes that although your opponents can be your enemies on the field, they can be a source of support off the field. Both coaches teach their student-athletes to play hard but to never lose sight of having fun and being good sports.  The reinforcement of these values is exhibited to their players at the conclusion of the yearly contest between the archrivals.  The contest between Wyoming Valley West and Lake Lehman does not end with a halfhearted cheer for the opponent and the shaking of hands before everyone leaves the field.  Instead, the players, coaches, umpires and fans join together to celebrate their participation in the sport in the form of a picnic.  Both coaches believe that this event teaches their student-athletes the value of good sportsmanship and the importance of never losing sight of the fun derived from participation in the sport of field hockey.<P>
To further promote this camaraderie and sportsmanship, Coach Fithian and Coach Lipski decided to join forces and participate in a community event.  The rival teams joined together in June of 1999 to take part in the Fifth Annual Lilly Lake Walk-A-Thon for Parkinson’s Disease.  The teams combined to earn over $450, which was donated to the fight to find a cure for the disease.  The walk-a-thon taught the players who participated the value of  having fun and working together for a common cause. <I> “We are sister teams and we support each other all the time,”</I> said Lake Lehman’s <B><I>Rachel Kasper</I></B>.  <I>”On the field and off the field, we work with each other to be successful.  This event was a lot of fun and, even though we were enemies with Wyoming Valley West, we are friends here fighting for a cause.”</I>.  The coaches hope that the life lessons taught will create values and memories that will last a lifetime for the student-athletes that come through their programs. <I>”There’s not too many teams that join up together for a cause,”</I> said Coach Fithian. <I>”We’re so competitive with each other during the season, now we are coming together for something positive.  It really says a lot for the girls in these programs.”</I><P>
In a world where the end result often overshadows the process, it is nice to know that there truly are coaches and athletes out there who are working together to make a difference both on and off the playing field, no matter how intense their on-field rivalry might be.<BR>

<FONT FACE="verdana,helvetica" SIZE="+1" COLOR="darkgreen"><B> US MEN'S TEAM COACH VISITS ARIZONA</B></FONT>
<P>
It's not everyday that a coach of a national sports team comes to your town....specifically to coach YOU!<BR>
In January, the Phoenix Scorpions Field Hockey Club had the pleasure of hosting <B><I>Shiv Jagday,</I></B> the US Men's team coach, over the weekend of January 21-23 for a field hockey clinic.  Bob Khosla, one of the founders of the Scorpions, invited Jagday, a personal friend, to come to Phoenix to coach our club. Training sessions were held Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The junior members of the club received special attention during these coaching session. A video analysis/social gathering was held on Saturday night, providing a break for the team.
<P>
Shiv provided instruction on the basic skills needed to be a good field hockey player. More specifically, he taught proper body and stick positioning, as well as practice drills covering passing, receiving, hitting, and tackling.<BR>
The event was well-received, with several club members attending all three days of the clinic. Members from the Arizona F.H.C. traveled from Tucson to participate as well. Overall, the clubs learned a lot, and a good time was had by all.<BR> 
Throughout the weekend, Shiv stressed to the juniors the importance of correct field hockey technique and practice. His encouragement inspired one of the junior Scorpions to attend the trials for the US Under 16 men's national team. Prabjit Singh traveled to Moorpark, CA the weekend of January 29 to try and earn a spot on the U16 men's team. This is the first time in the Scorpion's young history that a member has attended such an event. Through the continued dedication of club members and the continual support form the USFHA in general, the Scorpions hope to send even more junior members to national trials.<BR>

<B>FIELD HOCKEY IN THE DESERT</B></FONT> <I>by Charlene Howard McDonald</I><BR><BR>
Cactus and Corners? Palm Trees and Pushes? Indoor in August?<BR>
Think you're dreaming?  No.<BR>
And you’re not out in the cold somewhere anymore either, Constance....this is <I><B>SALSA-STYLE</B></I> hockey and it’s <I><B>HEATING UP</B></I> in the <I><B>WILD, WILD, SOUTHWEST!!!</B></I>
<BR><BR>
It is true that many things do not grow in a desert, but field hockey is not one of them.  In fact, there has been a hockey presence in the Grand Canyon State <I>(that’s Arizona…..to the geographically challenged!)</I> since at least the 1950s.<BR>
Back then, the University of Arizona, in Tucson, fielded a women’s collegiate team.  Ever since that time, the presence of field hockey in Arizona has continued to develop <I>(who said all we got around here is golf courses and swimming pools???).</I>
<BR><BR>
Currently, there are two coed club field hockey teams in the state.<BR>
The Arizona Field Hockey Club, based in Tucson, has been in existence since the late 1970’s.  Back in those years, Tucson actually had tree separate teams – the women’s collegiate team, as well as separate club teams for women and men.  By 1983 however, the women’s collegiate team was disbanded.  The men’s team, which always struggled to find players, was combined with the women’s club team, and thus the current coed club team was born.<BR>
In Phoenix, two separate clubs emerged in the last three years.  Dr. Rick Shaikewitz, an area chiropractor, advertised for field hockey at Arizona State University, and soon an unofficial ASU field hockey club team was formed.  In April of 1998, hockey enthusiasts Bob Khosla and Jan Jandu began forming their own team, and the Phoenix Scorpions began holding practices at Kiwanis Park in Tempe, in July 1998 with 4 adults and 4 kids.  A few months later, Khosla and Jandu discovered a club team already existed in the area. The Scorpions merged with Dr. Rick’s ASU team; the name Scorpions was kept <I>(well…what other name could you possibly use around here???)</I> as well as the practice field at ASU.  Through word of mouth and newspaper ads, the Scorpions’ membership has grown to include 35 members in the club.<BR>
Promoting youth involvement in field hockey has always been a focus of the Scorpions.  Since the team’s first practice, the club has had youth members.  Several of the regular adult players bring their children on a regular basis. Most of the time, the kids play right alongside the adults in the practice games.
<BR><BR>
<B>SHOWDOWN IN THE DESERT.....</B><BR>
In recent months, the two Arizona teams have come together for friendly competition.  The first meeting in March 1999 was held in Tempe at Arizona State University.  Two months later, the Scorpions traveled south to Tucson and played on the Arizona FHC’s home field at the University of Arizona.  The games had more of a social flair than a competitive match, with teams sharing food and drinks after a hot afternoon on the field.  In Tucson, the teams played 2 games - one against each other, and one mixed game.  Overall, the events have been a lot of fun and well-received.<BR>
Over Memorial Day weekend, representatives from both Arizona field hockey clubs traveled to Moorpark, California to participate in the annual California Cup at Moorpark College.  The Scorpions fielded a full 16-member team for the event, and played in the Social Division, while 6 members of the Arizona FHC joined a member of the Phoenix Scorpions FHC as members of the Santa Fe Griffins Field Hockey Club of New Mexico to form another Social Division team.<BR>
Both the Scorpions and the Griffins did well in the competitions.  The Scorpions finished first in their seven-team pool.  They finished 4th overall out of 24 Social teams,after losing their playoff games.  The Santa Fe Griffins finished in 5th place overall,
<BR><BR>
So, to those of you who think all we do around here in Sunny Arizona is sit by the pool sipping Margueritas, or play golf, think again.  And next time you come and visit our “Paradise on Earth”, load your hockey sticks in that golf bag of yours, and bring lots of sun block, ‘cause men…..t’is HOT!<BR>
<I>(if you have no clue as to how hot it gets in this part of the world: July/August we cruise steadily at 110F~115F - that's 43C~46C)</I><BR>

<B>UNITED AIRLINES FIELD HOCKEY LEAGUE</B></FONT>
<BR><BR>
They are called "Dream Teams": collections of talent so complete, it's difficult to fantom a single defeat.  But during the 1999 United Airlines Field Hockey League season, there was no dream.  No illusion.  Just pur Charm.<BR>
Armed with a roster full of Olympians, All-Americans, collegiate coaches and younger players from some of the nation's top programs, <B>the Southern Charm</B> ripped through the second season of the UAFHL to claim the league's title.<BR>
"It was not easy" said Charm coach <B><I>Karen Shelton</B></I> who has led the University of North Carolina to four NCAA championship.  "All the other teams gave us a battle, there wasn't really a game where we had it in hand from the beginning, and I think that's a credit to the entire league".<BR>
Before an overflowing crowd at the University of Maryland, the Charm held off the <B>New England Eclipe</B> 3-2 in the championship game to claim the league title.  The Charm took an early 2-0 lead on goals by Olympian <B><I>Laurel Martin</B></I> and US National Team member, and four time All-American <B><I>Nancy Pelligreen</B></I>.  But coach <B><I>Wendy Anderson</B></I>'s Eclipse quickly responded with an Olympic veteran of their own when <B><I>Barb Marois</B></I> scored on a penalty corner to pull New England to within 2-1 at halftime.  <B><I>Jess McClain</B></I> tied the game at 2-2 on a penalty stroke early in the second half, and the Eclipse seemed ready to end the Charm's dream of an undefeated season.<BR>
But as the team had done throughout the round-robin tournament, the Charm again rallied to take the lead on <B><I>Kelli Malinoski</B></I>'s game winner in the 53rd minute.  "They told me to score", said Malinoski the league's second leading scorer from Wake Forest University and the US Senior Reserve Team.  "I just saw an opening, dribbled through, and it went in."<BR>
Sheldon, who played for the league's runner-up "Green" team in 1998, took over the head coaching duties in 1999 and quickly assembled the all-start team with two tryout sessions and a few phone calls.<BR>
And as the Charm proved during the 1999 season, you're never too old to dream!
