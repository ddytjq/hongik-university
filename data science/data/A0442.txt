            <p class="body">Your employees will have lots of questions regarding 
              Stakeholder Pensions. Listed here are a few possible questions. 
              They may also help increase your understanding of Stakeholder Pensions. 
            </p>
            <p class="bodybold"><span class="bodytitle">What is the Stakeholder 
              Pension plan?</span> </p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="body"> It's a savings plan which will help you 
                to save for retirement in a tax-efficient way. The Government 
                has set minimum standards that companies must meet for a Stakeholder 
                Pension. These are to do with payment levels, costs, and terms 
                and conditions. The Stakeholder Pension plan complies with all 
                of these standards.</span> </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="bodytitle">Will a Stakeholder Pension be right for me?</p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="body"> You will need to consider your own personal circumstances 
                before deciding whether a Stakeholder Pension would be right for 
                you. The Stakeholder Pension Decision Trees and Explanatory Notes 
                in the employee application pack will give you more information 
                on how Stakeholder Pensions work. They will also help you decide 
                if a Stakeholder Pension would be a good choice for you as part 
                of your pension and other financial arrangements when you retire. 
              </span></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="bodytitle">Can I contribute to a Stakeholder Pension if 
              I am a member of my employer's Occupational 
              Pension Scheme?<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="body"> Yes you can contribute up to £3,600 gross each 
                year to a Stakeholder Pension as long as you earn less than £30,000 
                a year and are not a controlling director. Different rules apply 
                if you are a member of an Occupational Pension Scheme - Please 
                ask us for a separate Key Features document.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="bodytitle">How flexible is it?<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="body"> You, someone else on your behalf, or, if 
                you are working, your employer can make payments on a regular 
                basis or one-off payments at any time. </span></li>
              <li><span class="body"> You, or anyone else paying into your pension 
                on your behalf, can change your regular payment amount at any 
                time as long as your new premium is not below the minimum we allow.</span> 
              </li>
              <li><span class="body"> You can stop paying, or take a payment holiday 
                and restart later if your circumstances change. Be aware that 
                you'll reduce your future pension.</span> </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="bodytitle">What will I get back when I want to retire?<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="body"> The final value will depend on a number of things. 
                For example, how much is paid in, how long the payments are invested 
                for and how well our investments perform over the term of the 
                plan, and charges.</span> </li>
              <li><span class="body"> Your pension will depend on interest rates 
                at the time you convert the plan into your pension. To do this, 
                you'll need to buy another contract before you're 75. This is 
                called an annuity, and you can buy it from any pension company. 
                </span></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="bodytitle">What choices will I have when I retire?<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="body"> You can convert all of your plan value into a 
                pension, which will be taxable. Or you can take up to 25% of the 
                plan value as a tax-free cash sum in return for a smaller, taxable 
                pension.</span> </li>
              <li><span class="body"> You can start taking a pension at any time 
                between ages 50 and 75, including while you are still working. 
                You must start taking a pension no later than age 75. You can 
                take a pension in stages if you want to. You can start taking 
                a pension before age 50 only if you're in severe ill health, or 
                if the Inland Revenue has approved this for your job.</span> </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="bodytitle">How much can be paid into my plan each year?</p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="body"> However you decide to make payments, the minimum 
                amount is £20. Your employer can also make payments to your plan. 
              </span></li>
              <li><span class="body"> The Inland Revenue sets a maximum amount 
                that you can pay into your plan in any tax year (a tax year runs 
                from 6 April in one year to 5 April the next year). Everyone can 
                pay at least £3,600 gross a year into a Stakeholder Pension plan 
                irrespective of earnings.</span> </li>
              <li><span class="body"> You may be able to pay more - the maximum you 
                can pay depends on your age and how much you earn.</span> </li>
              <li><span class="body"> If you have a pension plan with another Pension 
                Company or a previous employer, you can transfer its value into 
                this plan. There is no guarantee that doing so will increase your 
                total pension. These payments have different rules - please ask 
                us for a separate Key Features Document.</span> </li>
              <li><span class="body"> If you're contracted-out of the State Earnings-Related 
                Pension Scheme (SERPS), the Government will refund part of your 
                National Insurance payments. We invest these payments into your 
                plan. These payments have different rules - please ask us for 
                a separate Key Features Document.</span> </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="bodytitle">What about tax?<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="body"> You'll get tax relief on your payments. 
                At current tax rates, the value of the tax advantage means that 
                for every £100 invested in your plan, you'll pay only £78. If 
                you are a higher rate taxpayer, you can claim the extra relief 
                through your self-assessment tax return.</span> </li>
              <li><span class="body"> If you take a cash lump sum when you retire, it's 
                currently free of tax. Your pension will be treated as earned 
                income and will be taxable.</span> </li>
              <li><span class="body"> If you die before you retire, there is normally 
                no inheritance tax payable on the value of your plan.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="bodytitle">Where are the payments invested?<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li> <span class="body">We will invest 100% of each payment. You 
                can choose to invest in one or more of eight funds. These are:

                to invest in we will invest your payments in the Lifestyle Profile 
                until you tell us otherwise. The Lifestyle Profile invests in 
                a combination of the Lifestyle FTSE All-Share Tracker Fund, the 
                Lifestyle Fixed Interest Fund and the Lifestyle Money Market Fund. 
                If you invest in the Lifestyle Profile, we will automatically 
                switch units within the fund during the last five years before 
                your scheduled retirement date. This is to help ensure that your 
                pension is not fully exposed to the effects if the stock market 
                crashes just before retirement. For more information on all these

                and without charge.</span> </li>
              <li><span class="body"> Each fund is made up of units. We use your payments 
                to buy units in the funds you choose. The price of one unit in 
                each fund depends on the value of the investments. We will work 
                out the value of your plan based on the total number of units 
                you have in each fund. If the unit prices rise or fall, so will 
                your plan value.</span> </li>

            <p class="bodytitle">What are the charges?<br>
              <span class="body">The only charge we take is a maximum of 1% of 
              the value of the investment funds each year. (See 'Summary Information'

                part of the plan has to be used to buy a pension for your husband 
                or wife. This could happen if you've transferred your plan from 
                another pension plan, or if you have a separate plan because you've
