<span class="textbd">Promoting astronomy with a difference, is the subject of Lydia Lousteaux's fifth article in her series on amateur astronomy.
</span>
<span class="text">
<br><br>
<span class="textbd">Music and Astronomy? But of Course! And a CD on a Space Mission!</span><br>
</p>
<p>
Today I am privileged to speak to Padi Boyd, the Music Director for 'The Chromatics', a musical group with an original style!
I read about them on their website: <a href="http://www.thechromatics.com/" class="nav2">www.thechromatics.com</a> and found out that the Chromatics have presented 'their normal' repertoire at the Kennedy Center's Millennium Stage, at First Night Annapolis; at the 1996 and 1999 Atlantic Region Harmony Sweepstakes (where they took 3rd place in 1999), they sang the National Anthem for the Baltimore Orioles(1996 and 1997); and also performed holiday music at the White House's candlelight tours (1996).
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
'The Chromies' have also written astronomically-correct a cappella songs to be used in classrooms for a project called AstroCappella. Their CD has flown in space!" Padi! What an honor! How did you manage that?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">PB:</span><br>
"One of the guys who used to sing with our group works in the Department that trains the astronauts on the use of specialized tools during their space walks to refurbish Hubble. He told John Grunsfeld, one of the Hubble repairers, about AstroCappella. John was intrigued because he's a high energy astrophysicist by training.  So he took the CD onboard in his personal pack for the servicing mission.  We were thrilled!"<br>

<a href="http://www.astrocappella.com/images/certificate.jpg" class="nav2">http://www.astrocappella.com/images/certificate.jpg</a><br>
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br> 
The Chromatics' latest CD is also a CD-ROM featuring 13 songs about the universe in addition to learning activities for the classroom.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">PB:</span><br>
"Yes, we're very excited to have just released this collection. Each song has extensive supporting material on the CDROM to help teachers use them in their classrooms-illustrated background information, detailed, teacher-tested lesson plans, fun activities for students to do on their own, as well as videos, slide shows, games and puzzles."
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br> 
Tell me, how did you all get together to become 'musical'? It works very well!
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">PB:</span><br>
"AstroCappella is only one branch of what we do musically---we're also a fairly busy semi-pro vocal band in the DC area, with an emphasis on original music. The Chromatics came into existence in April of 1995 as the offshoot of a former group: The 'OK Chorale' which was a large group (12 people) mostly from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, who got together to sing
a cappella and have fun.  There was a period of heavy turn-over, and in 1995 we decided to become more serious and focused, stay relatively small, and start making our own music.
</p>
<p>
Currently most of the 'Chromies' (as we call ourselves) are involved in space science in one way or another.  I am an X-ray astronomer, and so is Alan Smale (our bass). Soprano Karen Smale is a Web designer with a background in solar physics and astronomy.  The three of us work in Goddard's Laboratory for High Energy Astrophysics through various contractors. Alto Lisa Kelleher is a financial analyst at NASA Headquarters and John Meyer (tenor) designs and builds the power systems for space science missions at APL (he was involved in the NEAR power system, and is currently supporting a French payload which will launch soon). Deb Nixon (soprano), is a computer systems administrator for a law firm, and Paul Kolb (baritone) is connected to space science via his wife, who works for the NASA contractor Computer Science Corporation. So we're all techie, mostly in a space way."
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br> 
Please relate a brief history of your meeting and 'brain storming' which concluded in an obviously very successful musical endeavour aiding education and awareness in the field of astronomy.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">PB:</span><br>
"Karen and I met when we auditioned for the same spot in the 'OK Chorale'. The group took both of us! At that time none of the other 'Chromies' were in the group. Karen brought in her husband Alan, and I brought in Lisa.  Alan and Karen brought in John. Paul was in the right place at the right time and heard about auditions.  We found Deb through an ad in the newspaper. Part of my job in the lab here involveseducation and public out-reach. In 1995, I was the coordinator of our outreach group here, which is made up of volunteers in the lab who give some of their time to help bring the universe to the public. When I was researching grants, I came upon the NASA IDEA's grant program, a small program that gives seed money to innovative astronomy educational programs. In a very informal conversation, I brought up the idea of writing songs about astronomy and going for one of these grants.  It was very tongue in cheek at the time, but once we started talking about it, we all started recalling entire Schoolhouse Rock songs from 15 years ago.  We did a little research and confirmed what our guts told us already: that music is an incredibly powerful way into a person's mind and memory.  We joined forces with a middle school math teacher, Kara Granger, who worked on educational projects with our lab.  Together we came up with the idea of a short CD with five or so songs, and an activity to go along with each song, to be used in the middle school math or science classroom. 
'AstroCappella' was born.  That was May 1997."
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
What is your educational philosophy? What do you hope to accomplish with introducing songs into the math and science classroom?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">PB:</span><br>
"I'm committed to the idea that students and the general public have a right to learn about and enjoy our modern picture of the universe. For centuries, people have been fascinated with the universe, and Earth's and humanity's place in it.  We've learned so much about our solar system, our galaxy and the universe, but many times the most exciting, most thought-provoking ideas, don't make their way to students, and the taxpayers who are footing the bill.  Even in my lifetime, we've made such enormous strides in our knowledge of the Solar System.  Starting with the lunar landings, we've been  exploring our neighbour planets with ever-increasing technology, and finding out all kinds of new things, big and small. We've tried to get this sense of awe, and of continuous learning, into the AstroCappella project: the Pluto (planet or Kuiper Belt object?) controversy makes an appearance in the song Nine Planets.  The expanding universe is mentioned in several songs."
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br> 
How rewarding has it been working with classroom teachers to develop the songs and materials?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">PB:</span><br> 
"All along the way we've had strong, and very fruitful interactions with educators. As the project has grown, we've always listened to what teachers told us, and incorporated their suggestions into the songs and activities.  In fact, our latest songs, which appear for the first time on AstroCappella 2.0 were composed in response to a large teacher demand for songs about the Earth and solar system---topics that are widely taught in science classrooms at every level. Teachers are enthusiastic about getting technology into their classroom."
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
So the CD is not merely music.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">PB:</span><br>
"AstroCappella 2.0 is a music CD, and a CD-ROM containing extensive illustrated background information for each song, as well as classroom lesson plans, self-guided activities, slide shows, science music videos, glossaries, and more. Teachers can use
the information on the CD ROM to reinforce the concepts in the songs (and the curriculum!) in a variety of ways, while simultaneously using computers in their classroom to enhance their own presentation."
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
So it is a very diverse educational training tool.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">PB:</span><br>
"Yes it is.  We've made an effort to collect unconventional classroom activities. Since food is a proven motivator for kids, we have several activities with tasty edible results. Convection in the Sun is demonstrated with Miso soup, the solar system is toured using scale model objects such as oranges and peas, and the habitable zone near the Sun is discussed using make-your-own ice cream and chocolate fondue. There's also a recipe for a comet (which is *not* edible.) :-)"
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br> 
WOW! I am sure the kids really "Eat that up!" (Forgive the pun!) I downloaded several of these songs. They are really great! They are lively, entertaining and educational. You may check them out for yourself on the main 'AstroCappella' page (see below)  The songs available on the Web page are just a small sample of the AstroCappella 2.0 CD ROM, which is available for purchase by following the instructions on the webpage. The two catalogues: Mainly A Cappella, and Primarily A Cappella carry it and both take credit cards. In addition to the catalogues, the Science Songwriters' Association booth, which is present at many science teachers' meetings across the country, also has copies of AstroCappella 2.0 for sale. You want to act quickly because as Padi warns  us,"They're going like hotcakes"!
</p>
<p>
There are lots of pictures on 'The Chromatics' Web page under Sights and Sounds.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Will you "Travel with the Beat"?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">PB:</span><br>
"We'll travel if our expenses are covered! We've done banquet entertainment for science and technology meetings in the past."
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br> For booking information visit: <a href="http://www.thechromatics.com/booking.shtml" class="nav2">www.thechromatics.com/booking.shtml</a>  Being so very talented, space is not their only musical interest. They have two earlier CDs, <a href="http://www.thechromatics.com/cd.shtml" class="nav2">First Light</a> their debut collection , and <a href="http://www.thechromatics.com/unwrapped.shtml" class="nav2">Unwrapped</a> their holiday CD released in December 2000, which was nominated for two Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards (CARAs). 
</p>
<p>
Check out their webpage to see if you can catch them in your area, for performances you won't want
to miss.  I think we need these guys at our next Astronomy Club meeting!<br>
