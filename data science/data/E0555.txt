<H3>A Look at Operators</H3>

There are larger range of <B>C</B> operators. We already know:<P>
<PRE>
<B>
+
-
/ 
*  
%   (remainer or modulus operator)
</B>
</PRE>

<P>which have already been introduced. Slightly more advanced are the <B><TT>++</TT></B> and <B><TT>--</TT></B> <I>increment</I> and <I>decrement</I> operators. The <B><TT>++</TT></B> operator has already been used as an alternative way of writing:

<P><TT><B>i = i + 1;</TT></B>

<P>as

<P><TT><B>++i</B></TT>

<P>The <TT><B>--</B></TT> operator works in the same way but it subtracts one. That is:

<P><TT><B>--i</B></TT>

<P>is the same as

<P><B><TT>i = i - 1;</TT></B>

<P>Now we come to the complicated part. You can use <TT><B>++</B></TT> and <TT><B>--</B></TT> within more complicated expressions and assignments. For example:

<P><B><TT>a = ++i;</TT></B>

<P>means increment <B><TT>i</TT></B> and then store the results in <TT><B>a</B></TT>. This amazing <B>C</B> instruction is equivalent to:

<P>
<PRE>
<B>i = i + 1;
a = i;
</B>
</PRE>

<P>That is it does the work of two instructions and its much beloved by the average programmer. The only complication is that you can use the <TT><B>++</B></TT> and <TT><B>--</B></TT> operators in front of or behind a variable and:

<P><B><TT>a = ++i;</TT></B>

<P>is different from:

<P><B><TT>a = i++;</TT></B>

<P>The difference comes down to when exactly <TT><B>i</B></TT> is going to be incremented. With <TT><B>++i</B></TT> the variable is incremented and then the value is used. With <TT><B>i++</B></TT> the variable is used then the variable is incremented. That is:

<P><B><B>a = ++1;</B></B>

<P>is equivalent to:

<P><B><B>i = i + 1; a = i;</B></B>

<P>but:

<P><TT><B>a = i++;</B></TT>

<P>is equivalent to:

<P><TT><B>a = i; i = i + 1;</B></TT>

<P>The same is true for <TT><B>a = --i</B></TT> and <TT><B>a = i--</B></TT> only one is subtracted from <TT><B>i</B></TT>.

<P>The general principle is that using <TT><B>++</B></TT> or <TT><B> --</B></TT> before a variable means that it is incremented or decremented before it is used in whatever complicated expression it finds itself part of. If you use <TT><B>++</B></TT> or <TT><B>--</B></TT> after a variable then it is used first and the decremented or incremented. <B>C</B> programmers are apt to use it to the point where what is saved is often not worth the increased complexity. For example, what do you think:

<P><B><TT>result = i++ + --j;</TT></B>

<P>means? If you follow the rules its eventually obvious but it isn't exactly clear! It is in fact equivalent to:

<P><B><TT>j = j-1; result= i + j; i = i+1;</TT></B>

<P>As a final note remember that operators have a precedence which governs the order in which they are carried out. For example:

<P><TT><B>a+b*c</B></TT>

<P>actually means 

<P><B><TT>a+(b*c)</TT></B>

<P>rather than

<P><TT><B>(a+b)*c</B></TT>

<P>because <TT><B>*</B></TT> has a higher precence than <TT><B>+</B></TT>. You can use brackets to ensure that an expression is evaluated in the way you really want. Also notice that spaces do matter.If you write <TT><B>++i</B></TT> with spaces between the plus signs you will see an error message.
