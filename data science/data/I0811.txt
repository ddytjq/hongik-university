    <td><font SIZE="2">The problems of Doncaster Rovers have been well documented. They are
    now playing their football in the Football Conference but what does the loss of league
    status actually mean to a club?<p>Just think about the things that have changed since
    relegation. How far down the page do you have to look for Doncasters fixtures or results
    in the papers ? Don't even think about trying to find a match report ! Look on a football
    coupon - where are the Conference matches ? Nowhere.</p>
    <p>Grandstand, one of the biggest sports programmes in the country - how much coverage do
    they give to the Football Conference ? Bugger all.</p>
    <p>Where are Conference games shown ? L!ve TV !!</p>
    <p>The loss of league status means more than the visible signs. The additional loss of
    publicity will affect not just on the team but also on the town. Doncaster has managed to
    overcome these problems by making some big name signings to make sure that they stay in
    the news.</font></td>
