<P>&#9;Despite much initial skepticism, the general notion that mergers are a
major driving force in galaxy evolution has become widely, almost universally,
accepted.  In fact, it has become the dominant theme in the field in the last
decade. Not only have there been numerous simulational and observational
papers published, but there have been a number of major review articles
published as well.  For example, the interacting galaxies review of Barnes and
Hernquist (1992) focusses heavily on mergers and the numerical techniques used
to simulate them.  Schweizer's (1983, 1986, 1990) reviews cover the
observational study of merger remnants.  Hernquist (1993) reviews the
increasingly detailed efforts to compare models to possible elliptical merger
remnants.  Barnes (1995, also Barnes and Hernquist 1996) summarizes
simulational studies of gas dynamics in mergers.  Recent updates can be found
in the reviews of Barnes (1996), Bender (1996) and the articles in the Saas
Fee lectures edited by Friedli et al. (1998).</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;With so many excellent reviews available a detailed examination of this
area does not seem necessary.  Thus, the discussion here will be brief. 
(Similar comments apply to the following chapters on induced SF and nuclear
activity.)  As in the previous chapters I will try to focus on the important
physical processes.  Moreover, merging is in large part a repetition and
elaboration of the processes described above, so we do not start from scratch.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;We will concentrate on a few key issues, including the following
questions.  How fast are mergers?  What are their immediate effects on the
galaxies involved?  How do these effects differ from those experienced in
nonmerging collisions?  What kind of remnants do they leave, and are there
specific observable signatures of a past merger?  How common are mergers?
</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>6.1.  Overview and Historical Highlights</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Toomre's (1977) paper, discussed in section 1, would have been a
landmark even without the mergers-make-ellipticals conjecture presented there.
 The extension of his earlier work to the conclusion that most collisions end
in merger, because of the operation of dynamical friction, was pivotal in
itself.  The N-body and N-ring simulations he presented showed two galaxies
combining with truly shocking rapidity, though &quot;N&quot; was very small by
modern standards.  This evidently led Toomre to search the galaxy atlases for
examples, and good candidates were not hard to find.  As discussed in section
1.3 the merger elliptical idea initially seemed too speculative for many
astronomers, and there was similar skepticism about the idea of rapid merging.
 The field of N-body modeling was still quite young, but within a few years
after Toomre's paper quite a number of simulational studies had been published.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;In this first epoch of N-body merger simulations the galaxies were
generally modeled by a single (spheroidal or halo) component, with typically a
few thousand particles.  Listings and brief descriptions of the original
papers can be found in the reviews of Barnes and Hernquist (1992a, Hernquist
1993), and in the introduction to their recent paper (Barnes and Hernquist
1996).  In most cases the collision partners were assumed to be of equal or
near-equal mass.  The primary result of these models was confirmation that
galaxy collisions from initially nearly bound orbits do indeed generally
result in rapid merger.  This was hard to understand at first because two-body
relaxation times are very long, and two-body collisions are the basis of
Chandrasekhar's dynamical friction equation.  But these models revealed that
the transfer of orbital energy to internal motions was a global, not a local,
phenomenon (see sec. 5.1).  Moreover, though the fraction of mass lost was
found to be small, this material carries away significant energy and angular
momentum.  This is also true of material which is not lost, but flung out to
large radii in tidal tails.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;These models also showed that the merger remnant relaxed rapidly to a
quasi-steady state, which was at least qualitatively similar to galactic
bulges or elliptical galaxies.  This was interpreted to be the result of
&quot;violent relaxation&quot; described below.  The early simulation papers
contain detailed discussions of mass loss, radial mixing, and rotational and
structural properties of the remnants as a function of initial parameters. 
However, it was hard to know how far the comparison of these single component
models to observation could be taken.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The second epoch of simulational studies can be defined by the
publication of two component (disk-halo) N-body models (e.g., Gerhard 1981, 1983a,b,
<B> </B>Farouki and Shapiro 1982, Barnes 1988, 1992), and the first attempts
to simulate gaseous dissipation in collisions and mergers (e.g., Negroponte
and White 1983, Barnes and Hernquist 1991).  Since model galaxies with a
dynamically cold disk are generally assumed to be stabilized against the bar
instability by a hot halo, two components are needed in simulations with
disks.  Such simulations were required, in turn, to test the theory that an
elliptical could be formed from the merger of two disk galaxies.  Much larger
numbers of particles are required for such simulations, and so, their
development has been closely coupled to improvements in computer hardware and
software.  Because the technology developed so rapidly during this time,
N-body simulations now contain four to five orders of magnitude more particles
than in the early 1980s.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Second epoch models revealed more complexity in both the merging
process and in merger remnants.  A first example is in the orbital
deceleration.  As described in section 5.3 above, massive halos merge first,
and the merging of the denser disks and bulges is facilitated by the binding
of the large halo.  As expected, the dynamical heating in this process forges
remnants of much earlier Hubble type than the progenitors, i.e.,
elliptical-like.  However, as will be discussed below, the memory of the
initial structure and orbit are not immediately erased by the heating and
relaxation processes.  The gas dynamical models of this period produced
another important result, that a large fraction of the interstellar gas can be
funneled deep into the core of the merger remnant.  Bar-driven flows of the
type described in sec. 5.6 are often an important part of this process.  
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;There is no clear boundary between second epoch and current models,
though we can arbitrarily mark it by the appearance of three component
(bulge-disk-halo), gas-plus-star models (e.g., Barnes and Hernquist, 1996). 
While &quot;third epoch&quot; models have not produced as many major new
results as earlier ones, many new avenues are being explored.  These include,
for example, more extensive studies of collisional bars and their interaction
with other components of the merging galaxies (see sec. 5.6), and more
sophisticated attempts to model the feedback effects of starbursts (see
chapter 7).  Large particle numbers have also just simply allowed the
production of better models for specific mergers, like Barne's (1998) model
for the Antennae system.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;In conjunction with these developments in models and theory, there has
been great progress in the observational studies of the merger process.  These
were pioneered by F. Schweizer, foremost among the observers who took up
Toomre's challenge to find the evidence for mergers.  Schweizer's (1983 also
1998) review, already referred to in section 5.5, summarizes observational
indicators of merging and early work on merger remnants.  This paper begins
with a discussion of cD galaxies, the supergiant galaxies that are obvious
merger candidates.  This is because they have huge stellar envelopes, and
generally reside in clusters, so the chance of a cluster galaxy being captured
via dynamical friction are good (Ostriker and Tremaine 1975).  In fact, cD
galaxies are probably made by a succession of such mergers (&quot;galactic
cannibalism&quot;).  Schweizer cites two other &quot;promising pieces of
observational evidence of mergers in cD(s)&quot; - the presence of multiple
cores and asymmetric envelopes.  Both are nonequilibrium features and would be
expected to disappear on timescales much less than the age of the galaxies. 
Moreover, neither feature is the exclusive property of cD galaxies.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Schweizer not only provides examples of galaxies with multiple cores,
but also of galaxies with gas disks that do not rotate at the same rate as the
coextensive stars (indicating a relative tilt), and of galaxies apparently
containing two gas disks.  Again these are not equilibrium structures.  Since
that time many more multiple core, and &quot;counter-rotating&quot; disk
systems have been found.  Schweizer also argued that the polar ring galaxies
(discussed below) might be the result of accretion or merger.  Finally, and
most importantly, there is the presence of large scale &quot;tidal&quot;
features: ripples, shells, tails, etc., around many merger candidates (see
Figure 22).  In many of the systems Schweizer reviewed there is no obvious
alternative to a galaxy collision and merger origin for these morphologies.  
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;While Schweizer pursued detailed studies of individual systems,
statistical studies were beginning to provide evidence for enhanced
&quot;activity&quot; in colliding and merging galaxies, in the form of star
formation and nuclear activity, especially in optical colors and radio
continuum emission (also see references in the following chapters).  However,
the IRAS (Infrared Astronomical Satellite) mission in 1984 brought
observational studies of merger remnants into a new era.  IRAS's whole sky
survey in the far-infrared (with passbands centered at 60 and 100 microns)
revealed numerous ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs or ULIGs<SUP>
<FONT SIZE=2>*</FONT></SUP>), many of which were soon determined to be merger
remnants or other types of collisional galaxy </P>
<P>_____________________________________________</P>
<P><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>*</FONT></SUP> Also called FIRGs, far-infrared galaxies,
ELFs, extremely luminous galaxies, and LIGs, luminous infrared galaxies,
though this latter also includes somewhat less luminous objects. </P>
<P>_____________________________________________</P>
<P>(e.g., Aaronson and Olszewski 1984, Houck et al. 1984, 1985, Lonsdale,
Persson and Mathews 1984, Wright, Joseph and Meikle 1984, Soifer et al.
1984a,b and Joseph and Wright 1985).  Given the results on central activity in
merger remnants, and the first inklings of the process of gas funneling from
simulations, discovering hot dust was not a surprise.  However, the magnitude
and the extent of the phenomenon, i.e., that this class contains the brightest
galaxies known, was a shock.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;These discoveries enormously energized the field, generated many new
observational and theoretical studies, and eventually suggested the
possibility that the activity generated by mergers might be responsible for
most of the star formation (and thus metal production), and nuclear (quasar)
activity in the universe (e.g., Sanders et al. 1988, and the reviews of 
Soifer, Houck, and Neugebauer 1987, Sanders and Mirabel 1996, and the
conference proceedings edited by Persson 1987, and Sulentic, Keel and Telesco
1990).  This proposition remains speculative since, even if most ordinary
galaxies experienced &quot;major&quot; mergers in the past, the traces are
hard to find now.  However, the more limited proposition that - almost all of
the most infrared luminous objects (with L<SUB><FONT SIZE=2>IR</FONT></SUB>
&gt; 10<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>12</FONT></SUP> solar luminosities) are active merger
remnants has been quite firmly established in the time since IRAS.  This story
is told in detail in the recent review of Sanders and Mirabel (1996). 
Reaching this point has been an arduous process of: optical identification of
IRAS sources, obtaining redshifts to determine distances, and obtaining
observations in many other wavebands to understand the nature of the sources. 
Yet, by now many lines of evidence support the idea that these objects are
generally, </P>
<P></P>
<P>&quot;advanced mergers powered by a mixture of circumnuclear starburst(s)
and active galactic (nuclei)...fueled by an enormous concentration of
molecular gas that has been funneled into the merger nucleus.&quot;  (Sanders
and Mirabel 1996)</P>
<P>New high-resolution observational studies, like Scoville, Yun, and Bryant's
(1997) recent study of molecular gas in Arp 220, are indicative of the type of
advances we can expect in coming years.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;While much observational effort in the last decade has focussed on
merger </P>
<P>ULIRGs, optical and radio studies of nearby (non-ULIRG) merger systems have
continued to advance.  This includes the work of Schweizer and Seitzer (1992),
who used high quality optical images of faint tidal features to estimate the
relative ages of merger remnants in a large sample (see section 2.2). 
Schweizer and his collaborators also presented an important series of papers
detailing the star formation properties of several well-known merger remnants,
using both ground-based and Hubble Space Telescope imaging (Whitmore et al.
1993, Schweizer and Seitzer 1993, Whitmore and Schweizer 1995, and Schweizer
1996).  This work will be described in the following sections.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;At the same time, Hibbard was studying an evolutionary sequence of five
merger remnants for his thesis work (Hibbard 1995, also see Hibbard et al.
1994, Scoville et al. 1994, Schimonivich et al. 1995, Hibbard and van Gorkom
1996).  The youngest two systems in this sample are yet not fully merged (Arp
295 and NGC 4676, vs. the older systems NGC 520, NGC 3921 and NGC 7252).  He
used the VLA to map the HI distribution, and also carried out H-alpha and R
band imaging in all five systems.  With these data he carried out the most
complete analysis to date of the evolution the gas component in the merger
process.  In the systems he studied a significant fraction of the gas remained
in an atomic phase in long (but bound) tidal arms or tails through the merger
process.  Hibbard makes the interesting point that these systems and others
like them are generally not ULIRGs.  Thus, it appears that the ULIRG phase is
either short-lived and under-represented among nearby mergers, or there are at
least two classes of merger (see the contrasting examples in Hibbard 1997). 
With the combined work of Hibbard and Schweizer (1996 and references therein),
a great deal of high-resolution multi-waveband data is now published for the
NGC 3921 and NGC 7252 systems, which provides much evidence in support of the
Toomre's conjecture that both systems are well on their way to becoming
elliptical galaxies.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Another parallel strand of merger research is the study of shape and
kinematic profiles of elliptical galaxies, especially their cores, and
comparison of these to merger simulations in the hope of finding unique and
long-lived signatures of the merger origin of ellipticals.  &quot;Boxy&quot;
isophotes are a first example.  These are defined as rather square-shaped
surface brightness contours, that contrast with the usual spheroidal profiles.
 Bender (1990 and references therein) has provided evidence that boxy
ellipticals are intermediate age merger remnants.  A second example is the
presence of a &quot;kinematically decoupled core&quot; in an elliptical.  That
is, the spin axis of the core is at a large angle relative to the spin axis of
the bulk of the galaxy.  Counter-rotating cores are extreme cases.  Bender
(1996 and references therein) states that &quot;more than 50% of all luminous
ellipticals contain kinematically decoupled cores, and these galaxies are
found in all environments.  In general, the arguments that these cores result
from some kind of merger are strong.  It also seems that they can have a long
lifetime, and so they may provide the best long-time signature of a merger yet
discovered.  More subtle kinematic indicators, like the misalignment between
the core spin axis and the minor axis of a flattened (but slowly rotating)
elliptical may also be useful in future (Barnes 1992, 1998, Hernquist 1993). 
Ultimately, the reason for the existence of such structures is the fact that
violent relaxation, and radial mixing in particular, do not go to completion
in the merger process.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;This concludes our general history and overview of mergers.  In the
following sections we will look at a few specific aspects of the process in
more detail.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>6.2.  Major Merger Dynamics</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;In this section we will consider some of the physical processes that
characterize &quot;major mergers&quot;.  This term, major merger, has been
adopted in recent years to describe mergers between nearly equal progenitors,
which have a major effect on both galaxies.  &quot;Minor mergers&quot; involve
a significantly smaller companion, and so the primary galaxy is not highly
disrupted.  Note that major mergers do not necessarily involve large or
massive galaxies, nor do minor mergers involve only small galaxies.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<P><B>6.2.1.  Violent Relaxation</B></P>
</CENTER>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Violent relaxation is a wonderful oxymoron!  The basic idea is that
large amplitude fluctuations in the gravitational field, as in galaxy
formation or collisions, drive a relaxation process that is much faster than
the two-body relaxation time due to star-star encounters with a galaxy.  The
statistical formulation and a derivation of the equilibrium stellar phase
space distribution was originally given by Lynden-Bell (1967, also see BT sec.
4.7).  Specifically, he demonstrated that violent relaxation could lead to an
equilibrium (e.g., Maxwell-Boltzmann) distribution function on a relatively
short timescale.  Tremaine, H&eacute;non, and Lynden-Bell (1986, also see
Kull, Treumann, and B&eacute;hringer 1997) later investigated constraints on
mixing and the relaxation process using H-functions.  They begin by noting
that the equilibrium state that violent relaxation drives stellar systems
towards, has infinite mass.   Since galaxies do not, violent relaxation cannot
go to completion, and &quot;potential variations die away before relaxation is
complete&quot;.  They find that the remnants of this process can only resemble
real elliptical galaxies if the initial state is cold or clumpy, e.g., far
enough from equilibrium in the interaction environment to allow for
considerable relaxation.  This turns some of the old objections to forming
ellipticals from dynamically cold spirals on their head.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;While &quot;incomplete violent relaxation&quot; is a bit difficult to
visualize, the theory is very helpful for understanding the merger simulations
and observational properties discussed in the previous section.  Specifically,
it helps explain why even early simulations found rapid relaxation to an
elliptical-like surface density profile, in conjunction with modest radial
mixing.  On the observational side, it explains why stellar surface density
profiles typical of quiescent ellipticals (e.g., King or de Vaucouleurs
profiles, see BT) are found in the presence of multiple cores and tidal
structures.  The discovery that dynamical friction is the result of a global
response, and can be quite impulsive (see section 5.1), suggests that it is
closely related to violent relaxation.  This in turn helps understand the
short timescale of merging.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Another aspect of the conjoint global response of violent relaxation
and dynamical friction is a result emphasized by Barnes (1992), and which
dates to Farouki and Shapiro (1982).  This is that orbit shapes, and orbital
decay are primarily determined by one parameter - the ratio of
&quot;pericentric separation&quot; to the galactic half-mass radius.  Note,
however, that this result applies to mergers between equal-mass galaxies on
initially parabolic orbits.  Physically it is probably a result of the fact
that in these cases halos merge promptly, and constrain subsequent evolution. 
In minor mergers with small companions other parameters are also important.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;To approach the topic from aslightly different angle, consider the
recent paper of Chavanis, Sommeria, and Robert (1996), which revives an old
analogy between the equations of two dimensional turbulence (Euler eqs.) and
stellar dynamics (Vlasov eq.), and compares them in detail.  The authors
reproduce Lynden-Bell's equilibrium distribution function using a mixing
entropy function and the Principle of Maximum Entropy Production.  They also
derive a Fokker-Planck equation for the coarse-grained distribution function
to describe violent relaxation.  In both turbulence and stellar relaxation
there is a tendency to &quot;develop finer and finer filaments&quot;, though
in the stellar case these filaments lie in the six dimensional phase space. 
In the turbulence case the relaxation also proceeds in two stages, the first
is rapid, like violent relaxation, and leads to the formation of large
coherent structures.  The final viscous relaxation to the true equilibrium
takes much longer, like two-body relaxation. </P>
<P></P>
<CENTER>
<P><B>6.2.2.  Gas Funneling</B></P>
<P></P>
</CENTER>
<P>&#9;Because the gas disk is usually more extensive than the stellar disk in
disk galaxies, and thus has higher mean specific angular momentum, it is
reasonable to expect that more would be lost or swung out to large radii in
tidal collisions.  Thus, it is surprising how much gas can be funneled to the
center of some merger remnants, and there provide fuel for high levels of
activity.  On the other hand, interstellar gas is highly dissipative. 
Large-scale shocks are not only good at radiating energy, but also can
transport angular momentum efficiently.  In several sections above we have
described the mechanisms that simulations have shown affect this transport and
the gas funneling.  Foremost among these are collisionally induced bars
(section 5.6) and tidal spirals, including both internal waves and extended
tidal tails (sections 3.5 and 5.4).</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;While the numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of these
processes (see references in the previous section), to date no simple physical
or analytical models have been produced which are capable of predicting the
amount of funneled gas, or how it scales with collision parameters.  This is
understandable since very high-resolution, multi-component simulations with
both gas and stars are required to study the phenomenon, and be confident of
the accuracy of the results.  Moreover, an extensive exploration of the
high-dimensional parameter space will be required.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Before leaving this topic we should note that the existence of the
funneling process resolves an important problem in merger theory.  That is,
how to explain the very dense cores found in some ellipticals (see e.g., Faber
et al. 1997).  As Hernquist (1993) points out, mergers between purely stellar
disk galaxies do not generally produce such dense cores, unless they have
dense bulges to begin with.  However, the dissipative gas is not bound by the
same fundamental phase space constraints as collisionless stellar systems. 
Thus, as observed, funneling can build large central densities, and starbursts
can convert the gas to a dense stellar core, though realistic simulations of
this process have not yet been carried out.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>6.3.  Minor Mergers: Disk Heating and Aging</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Although, as discussed in section 5.2, there has long been interest in
the &quot;sinking satellite&quot; problem, there has been much less simulation
work than on mergers between equal mass galaxies.  The observational
signatures of minor mergers are much weaker than those of major mergers, so
observational comparisons are harder.  Moreover, there are technical
difficulties in the simulations, especially in adequately resolving a
companion that is much smaller than the primary.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;On the other hand, minor mergers are likely to be much more common than
major ones.  Hernquist and Mihos (1995) summarize the evidence for this
conclusion, and provide a listing of earlier works.  At first this conclusion
seems like a relatively simple matter.  Galaxies have a wide range of masses
(over 4-5 orders of magnitude), so it would seem unlikely that collision
partners have nearly the same mass.  However, the companion to primary mass
ratio probably has to about 0.1 or less to make the merger &quot;minor&quot;,
and more than about 0.01 to have substantial consequences for the primary.  We
can make a simple estimate of the relative number of companions in these mass
ranges based on the field galaxy luminosity function, but even this is
dangerous.  Collision partners are not selected randomly from the luminosity
function.  They are generally members of bound groups or of groups interacting
with other groups or clusters (see chapter 9).  Thus, hierarchical clustering
biases the statistics of collision partners.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The work of Zaritsky et al. (1993b), discussed above in connection with
the Holmberg Effect, provides especially useful input on this subject.  In
this study of satellites around late-type spirals the authors find mean of 1.5
satellites per primary, and of course, there may have been more in the past,
which have already merged.  The mean mass of these satellites is estimated to
be about 10%, exactly the right magnitude for minor mergers.  The luminosity
distribution of all the satellites is well fit by a Schechter form, like the
field luminosity function, which shows that at least they are not an unusual
population.  The number of objects in the survey (69 satellites) is not large
enough to definitively answer the questions above, but it does support the
opinion that they are common.  So too does the increasingly common discoveries
of mild signatures of old collisions or mergers in otherwise normal galaxies.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Despite the difficulties, several simulational studies of minor mergers
have been published recently.  These papers (Mihos and Hernquist 1994a,
Hernquist and Mihos 1995, and Walker, Mihos and Hernquist 1996), present the
results of fully self-consistent, high particle number, multiple component
simulations.  These simulations use about a 10% mass companion, on a prograde
orbit of modest inclination (about 30&#176;), with a companion density
comparable to the mean of the primary disk.  Thus, these models are a
continuation and update of the sinking satellite studies described above.  As
in the earlier studies, the response is global, and the merger is prompt. 
Somewhat surprisingly, the results of these simulations are qualitatively
similar to those of major merger models.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The Hernquist and Mihos (1995) simulations, in particular, show strong
gas funneling.  Up to almost half of the primary gas mass can be deposited in
a dense core, plausibly inducing starbursts and other nuclear activity.  This
is comparable to the funneling in major mergers, which is surprising because
the collisional distortions are far less, and no strong bar is formed. 
Instead, another now familiar mechanism seems to be the cause.  Strong spiral
arms are induced by the interaction, and Hernquist and Mihos (1995) argue that
gravitational torqueing by these waves drives the radial gas flows.  There is
an interesting wrinkle however.  The authors suggest that strong shocks form
in the waves, and that the dissipation in these shocks yields a positional
offset between the gas and the stars in the wave.  This offset provides a
lever arm with which the stellar wave can torque the gas.  Thus, the offset is
seen as the key to the strong radial flow.  For the present these new results
should be viewed with caution, since they are based on an isothermal equation
of state.  For example, heating by star formation in the waves could stir the
gas, yielding a smaller offset, and less torque.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Hernquist and Mihos (1995 and references therein) also confirm a result
hinted at in earlier works, the radial gas flows can be delayed or inhibited
by the presence of a compact bulge in the primary.  They were not able to
derive a specific mechanism for this effect, but they conjecture that it may
be related to the presence of inner Lindblad resonances.  On the basis of the
studies of induced bars described in the previous chapter, this seems very reasonable.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The paper of Walker et al. (1996) presents the most detailed study to
date of another important consequence of sinking satellite minor mergers,
dynamical heating of the stellar disk.  The parameters of the 500,000 particle
simulation presented there are essentially the same as those of Hernquist and
Mihos.  Over the 1.0 Gyr. course of the merger the stellar disk thickens by
60%.  Velocity dispersions are increased in all three directions.  The net
result is that the merger remnant is a disk galaxy of substantially earlier
Hubble type.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;This result supports Schweizer's (1986, 1990) general conjecture, that
minor mergers can push late-type progenitors along the Hubble sequence towards
earlier types.  This idea is a corollary of Toomre's mergers-make-ellipticals
conjecture, and many of the same observational techniques are useful for
investigating it.  For example, in terms of tidal remnants, it has been clear
from early on that many shell galaxies (sec. 5.5) were S0, rather than
elliptical galaxies.  Similarly, many polar ring galaxies are of relatively
early type, except for the ring (see Schweizer 1986, and the following
section).  Counter-rotating disks or cores are also found in objects of type
S0 and Sa.  The probable merger or accretion event which produced these had to
be minor enough to preserve the disks.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Another general point about minor mergers is that, since the outcome
depends on both the structural and orbital parameters of the companion, they
have the potential to amplify the diversity of galaxies.  This raises the
question, if minor mergers are common, then why haven't they disrupted
structural relationships among the galaxies?  This complex question may in
fact have a fairly simple answer.  Most of the increased diversity may be
represented by relatively faint fossil collisional structures around the
primary, while the effects of global or deeply penetrating perturbations
rapidly relax to more generic forms.  Processes like violent relaxation and
dynamical friction evidently constrain evolution to approximate the
fundamental relationships.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;In sum, though minor mergers have been somewhat neglected relative to
their &quot;major&quot; siblings, there are many motivations for future study,
and recent work demonstrates the feasibility of such studies.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>6.4.  New Disks</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;We have seen that major mergers can destroy galaxy disks, converting
the progenitors into ellipticals, and that minor mergers can heat and age
disks.  But there is another side to this subject, minor mergers with
companion disruption can lead to the formation of new, or reinvigorated disks.
 Since we have already considered both companion disruption and minor mergers,
the goal of this section is simply to add a few missing pieces to the picture.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;<B>6.4.1.  Disks in Ellipticals</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Until about the mid-1970s there was little evidence for a cool gas,
disk component in ellipticals, but with more sensitive instruments this
situation has changed greatly (see Bregman, Hogg, and Roberts 1992 and
Macchetto et al. 1996 for survey statistics).  Moreover, as noted above,
kinematically decoupled cores have been found now in a high fraction of
ellipticals.  These core disks are discovered from their H<FONT FACE="symbol">a
</FONT> emission or from dust obscuration (see the review of de Zeeuw 1994). 
However, they are not usually very blue, but rather normal photometrically
relative to the cores of all early-type galaxies (Carollo 1997, Carollo et al.
1997).  There are other possible sources for cool gas in ellipticals, e.g.,
stellar mass loss or cooling flows out of hot cluster gas.  However, disks
resulting from these sources would be expected to align with the kinematic
axis of the galaxy.  On the other hand, material from accretion or (minor)
mergers is thought to settle promptly into a disk whose orientation depends on
the spin of the progenitor and the orbital parameters.  (See Barnes 1998 on
the formation of inner and outer disks in major mergers, and Thakar and Ryden
1996, Struck 1997 on mass transfer.)  These disks then evolve to a preferred
plane of the host, but on a longer timescale (see de Zeeuw 1994 and references
therein).  Nonetheless, though the argument seems straightforward, it is still
based on very circumstantial evidence in most cases.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;An HST study of the brightness profiles in the cores of a sample of 61
early-type galaxies finds that they can be divided into two distinct types:
&quot;core&quot; galaxies with steep &quot;power-law&quot; profiles that break
to a much flatter form within a core radius, and shallower power-laws with no
resolvable changes into the center (Lauer et al. 1997, Faber et al. 1997). 
The latter type is most easily explained as the result of a merger of a small,
gas-rich companion.  However, disks were not detectable in most of the
power-law objects in this sample, but many new searches for HI and molecular
gas in elliptical galaxies are underway (van Gorkom and Schimonivich 1997,
Rupen 1997).</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;While kinematically decoupled cores are common in large, luminous
ellipticals, a related phenomenon is at least as common in low luminosity
ellipticals.  This is the presence of flattened, pointed or &quot;disky&quot;
isophotes.  Galaxies containing them are called &quot;disky ellipticals&quot;,
and are usually also rotationally flattened, independent of the disky part. 
the basis for this statement is the fact that photometric and kinematic
decompositions of disk and bulge parts, like those derived for disk galaxies,
seem to work well on these objects (see Scorza and Bender 1996, Bender 1997). 
The derived disk-to-bulge luminosity ratios (D/B) overlap and extend the low
end of the range for S0 galaxies, indicating continuity across the types.  The
disky ellipticals also extend the disk galaxy trends in plots of bulge or disk
luminosity versus D/B.  Thus, there are several indications that these
galaxies represent an extension of the Hubble disk sequence.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Do the disks and the high rotation rates of these galaxies result from
mergers?  Scorza and Bender point out that merger simulations with gas do lead
to changes in stellar orbit families in such a way as to make a more oblate
remnant, which is encouraging for the merger theory.  However, the discovery
and study of these objects is very recent, and there is far too little data
for firm conclusions.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Ellipticals with extensive cool gas disks, extending beyond the optical
disk, are still very rare (van Gorkom 1992).  Thus, if mergers of spirals make
ellipticals, then they are indeed efficient about consuming or heating and
dispersing the cool gas of their progenitors.  However, the nearby giant
elliptical, NGC 5128 = Cen A, with its large gas and dust disk, and evidence
for a recent merger (Ebneter and Balick 1983), stands as an apparent
counter-example.  More likely, however, the elliptical was formed long before
the recent merger.  (For other such examples see the discussion of section
4.1, and the papers of Appleton 1983 and de Mello et al. 1995, 1996.)  The
work of Whitmore et al. (1997) on what may be dynamically young ellipticals
provides especially interesting &quot;archaeological&quot; support for these ideas.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;<B>6.4.2.  Counter-rotating Disks in S0 and Sa Galaxies</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;There are also numerous examples of counter-rotating disks among
early-type spirals.  E.g., Thakar and Ryden 1996 list a number of recent
references for S0s.  Bertola, Buson, and Zeilinger (1992) estimated that about
40% of S0 galaxies contain ionized gas of external origin on the basis of a
small survey. Very recently, Lovelace, Jore, and Haynes (1997) have provided a
list of (primarily) Sa type galaxies with extensive counter-rotating disks. 
For a review, history of the subject, and summary of several individual
systems see Rubin (1994b).  As in the case of the ellipticals, the most likely
explanation for their existence is accretion or merger.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;What is most remarkable about these disks is that, in contrast to
counter-rotating cores in luminous ellipticals, they are extensive, sometimes
as large as the parent disk.  They can also contain significant mass, up to
20-50% of the disk.  This makes it difficult to account for them in any way
except as the result of a merger.  NGC 4550 in Virgo is the most famous S0
example, see Rubin (1994b).  A later type (Sab) example is the so-called
&quot;Black-Eye&quot; or &quot;Evil-Eye&quot; galaxy, NGC 4826, whose gas disk
is nearly co-planar with the stars, but has very complicated kinematics.  It
rotates with the stars in the inner regions, but reverses direction in the
outer disk (see Rubin 1994a, Walterbos, Braun, and Kennicutt 1994).  The
prominant dust lane (the black-eye) lies in the transition region.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Another example, is NGC 4138, an Sa galaxy studied at multiple
wavelengths by Jore, Broeils and Haynes (1996).  In this latter system 20% of
the disk stars and all of the gas rotate counter to the majority of the stars.
 The counter-rotating HI gas extends to a radius of 2.5 times the outer radius
of the stars.  The smooth distribution of the components and Balmer absorption
lines indicate that the SF stopped about 10<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>8</FONT></SUP>
yrs. ago, giving some constraints on the age of the counter-disk.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;This raises the question of how stable and long-lived are these disks? 
Rubin (1994b) notes that this question has been considered for several
decades, i.e., before the existence of oppositely rotating disks was
demonstrated!  The answers she records are quite varied.  The latest input is
the work of Lovelace et al. (1997), who summarize recent work and suggest that
the oppositely rotating disks can drive density waves, especially the
one-armed mode.  These density waves increase the dissipation and effective
viscosity in the gas leading to accretion.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The other obvious question - how do these extensive counterotating
disks form - is addressed by Thakar and Ryden (1996).  They modeled
counter-disk formation as a result of both continuous and episodic infall. 
The former could be infall out of a stream, like the Magellanic stream around
the Milky Way.  The latter could result from the merger of a gas-rich disk,
for example.  The key result of these simulations is that the infall rate must
not be too rapid, or the sudden introduction of a large amount of mass leads
to excessive heating of the pre-existing disk.  This constraint becomes a real
difficulty in producing massive counter-disks.  Thus, the authors argue that
it is unlikely that such disks are produced by the merger of a gas-rich dwarf.
 This is a surprising result, worthy of further study.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;<B>6.4.3.  Polar Ring Galaxies</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;In the present context, these objects are viewed as another kind of
accreted disk.  However, as their name implies they are generally oriented
perpendicular to the main disk, rather than being contained within the same
plane, e.g., Figure 23.  Moreover, it believed that they are usually annular
disks, with empty middles, though in many cases this is hard to determine
observationally, see Figure 23 and the schematic examples of Figure 24.  This
may be because they are polar and often contain gas; gas cloud collisions with
clouds in the primary disk would remove the inner part of a complete polar
disk.  Moreover, if they do indeed result from accretion in most cases, the
material may have a relatively large specific angular momentum.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;While they are the third type of &quot;ring&quot; galaxy we have
considered they are clearly unrelated to either collisional ring waves or
resonance rings within disks.  The primary or host galaxy typically has the
characteristics of an S0 type, with relatively little gas or dust (again in
contrast to the other types of ring).  This seems to confirm the idea that
polar rings generally orbit through the poles of an oblate galaxy, rather than
around the equator of a prolate one.  The polar ring is usually gas-rich and
bluer than the host, with little or no old star component.  Whitmore et al.
(1990) have assembled a catalog with more than 100 examples.  Review articles
can be found in the book of Casertano, Sackett and Briggs (1991), with a very
recent one by Cox and Sparke (1996).  Because this latter paper is so current,
we will limit the discussion in this section.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Polar rings probably form out of the total or partial disruption of a
gas-rich companion (see e.g., Richter, Sackett and Sparke 1994).  The process
is like that for forming disks in ellipticals described above.  Specifically,
the accreted gas settles promptly into a plane determined by the collision
parameters, and evolves to a preferred plane on a timescale much longer than
the orbital or azimuthal smearing time.  The initial plane is likely the
orbital plane of the companion if it is promptly destroyed (Katz and Rix 1992,
Thakar and Ryden 1996).  If the ring forms out of a bridge with gas from both
galaxies, formed in a direct collision, its orbital plane may be perpendicular
to the bridge (Struck 1997).  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Recently, a couple of observational studies of forming polar rings have
appeared.  Cox et al. (1996) present HI mapping of the II Zw 70/71 system. 
Reshetnikov et al. (1996) present optical photometry of the Arp 87 and Arp 293
systems.  In all three cases the two galaxies are still attached by a bridge,
which may include gas from both galaxies as in the Struck (1997) models. 
Moreover, the polar ring is either the smaller galaxy (Arp 87), or the two
galaxies are of comparable size.  This is not consonant with the fact that
most &quot;mature&quot; polar rings are isolated, so, if these systems are
future polar rings, a great deal of evolution remains, including the merger of
the two galaxies.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Since the discovery of most of these objects in the 1970s and 80s much
effort has focussed on studies of ring dynamics, with the goal of
understanding why the rings are generally oriented around the poles, rather
than at arbitrary angle.  Specifically, the secondary evolution to a preferred
plane is thought to be the result of differential precession.  Orbital
precession depends on both the inclination and the mean orbital radius of a
gas cloud.  Thus, annular rings at different mean radii precess at different
rates (see the formula in Cox and Sparke 1996).  If these rings are elliptical
rather than perfectly circular, which seems likely initially, differential
precession will lead to ring intersections, gas cloud collisions, and
dissipation.  The most likely result is settling into one of the preferred
planes, i.e., either the equatorial or a polar plane.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;One problem with this scenario is that there are some polar rings,
which do not appear to be young, and in fact have red colors, but are still
significantly inclined.  Katz and Rix (1992) have argued that this could be
the result of viscous couplings that are strong enough to prevent the
independent precession of different rings.  Thus, the whole polar disk would
be viscously connected, and precess at some mean rate.  However, another
effect of the viscosity would be relatively rapid radial spreading in the
disk, and presumably decreased lifetime.  Nonetheless, Katz and Rix's
simulations show that a quite long-lived and warped disk can develop.  Recent
HI (Richter, Sackett and Sparke 1994) and CO (Galletta, Sage and Sparke 1997)
studies of polar rings have shown that many contain as much gas as a typical
late-type galaxy, rather than a dwarf.  In this case the self-gravity of the
gas can play a significant role in holding the polar-ring together, again
suggesting that they can be much longer-lived than originally thought.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Because of their large radii and orthogonal orientation, polar rings
can offer a unique probe of the dark halos of galaxies.  Cox and Sparke (1996)
describe several techniques that have been used to analyse the halos of more
than half a dozen galaxies.  The particular advantage offered by the polar
disk is information on the flattening of the host halo.  Not many systems have
been studied yet, and there are ambiguities or significant uncertainties in
all the methods.  However, the derived flattenings range from round to quite
flat, though the majority are quite round.  Different methods also give
conflicting results, which is the case with NGC 4650A in particular, whose
halo is either rounder than an E3 galaxy, or as flat as an E6-7, see Cox and
Sparke.  Nonetheless, these are early days in the use of this technique, and
ultimately the information obtained should be of great importance.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>6.5.  Multiple Mergers</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The topic of the simultaneous merger of more than two galaxies, or a
rapid sequence of mergers, brings us to the edge of a nearly unexplored
frontier.  At first we might question the importance of this subject, since
the universe is a low density gas of galaxies.  However, a glance at the
entwined galaxies in  the compact groups illustrated in the Arp (1966) and Arp
and Madore (1987) atlases, and the equivalent Vorontsov-Velyaminov (1959,
1977) galaxy &quot;chains&quot;, assures us that multiple collisions do occur.
 Schneider and Gunn (1982) presented a photometric and spectroscopic study of
a &quot;nightmarish&quot; example in the cluster V Zw 311, where the central
object has at least 9 &quot;nuclei&quot; wrapped in a common envelope.  Each
nucleus is roughly as bright as other cluster galaxies.  As a virtual
&quot;poster-child&quot; for mergers in progress it was adopted as the
frontispiece for the book of Tinsley and Larson (1977).  While this system
illustrates the extremes of multiple merging, Ramella et al. (1994) present
reasons why the process may be common.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;These authors studied the 38 compact galaxy groups from the catalog of
Hickson (1982, 1993), and which also were included in published redshift
surveys.  The redshifts confirm group membership and eliminate most chance
superpositions.  Ramella et al. find that 29 of these compact groups are
embedded in larger, but looser systems.  They report that these larger
associations are similar to groups discovered in the Center for Astrophysics
redshift survey, and that the latter also often contain compact subgroups.  In
addition they use N-body simulations to show that compact galaxy groups
&quot;form continually during the collapse of rich loose groups&quot;.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;In the introduction (sec. 1.4) we reviewed how initial beliefs that
galaxy collisions must be rare were overcome when it was realized that most
collisions are between galaxies bound in groups.  The environment makes a
collision much more likely, if not inevitable.  The results of the previous
paragraph extend this conclusion to another level of complexity.  Multiple
mergers are also not accidental.  They are apparently the result of the
formation of rich substructures in the (hierarchical) evolution of rich groups.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Unfortunately, this insight does not make multiple mergers easier to
model.  On the contrary, there are many difficulties, including the fact that
there are a myriad of initial conditions.  The need for good spatial and
particle resolution in each component of each galaxy strains computer
capabilities.  Nonetheless, some impressive simulational studies have been
published recently.  They include the paper of Governato, Tozzi, and Cavaliere
(1996), who studied the formation of Hickson compact groups in the collapse of
loose groups.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Weil and Hernquist (1996, also 1994) followed the evolution of compact
groups of 6 identical galaxies until all were merged, and they then studied
the properties of the final remnant.  Each galaxy in their half-dozen N-body
simulations has bulge, disk and halo components.  Some of their basic results
are the same as in pairwise mergers, which is not surprising since the basic
physics is the same.  For example, the halos merge first, and the remnant is a
dynamically hot elliptical-like object.  On the other hand, there are a number
of important differences in both morphological and kinematic properties.  The
multiple merger remnants are more commonly oblate spheroids that &quot;appear
round from many viewing angles.&quot;  A large fraction (about half) of the
substantial orbital angular momentum of the initial group is incorporated in
the remnant.  The spin of all components increases.  However, the ratio v
<SUB><FONT SIZE=2>r</FONT></SUB>/<FONT FACE="symbol">s</FONT> of the
rotational velocity to the random velocity dispersion is small in the central
regions, but increases to unity in the outer regions.  At a given ellipticity,
multiple mergers have somewhat higher (averaged) values of v<SUB><FONT SIZE=2>r
</FONT></SUB>/<FONT FACE="symbol">s</FONT>, in agreement with the
observations.  Several other properties of the multiple merger models were
also found to agree better with observation than pairwise merger remnants.  
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;This pioneering study has many limitations - only a few initial
conditions are used, all galaxies in the group are identical, and gas is not
included.  However, the models are sufficient to support the idea that
multiple mergers of early-type spirals might be the best way to make
ellipticals.  Support also comes from Statler, Smecker-Hane and Cecil's (1996)
spectroscopic study of the elliptical NGC 1700, which found a variety of
evidence for more than one merger, and also an oblate form and increasing
rotation at large radii in accord with Weil and Hernquist's models. 
Presumably, the early-type spirals would themselves be made in earlier
mergers.  This suggests a modification of Toomre's ellipticals-from-mergers
theory, to a multi-step or hierarchical buildup.</P>
