Abstract
<p>
We study some aspects of the evolution of compact M32-type
elliptical galaxies (cEs) during their orbital decay onto
a massive neighbour. The characteristics of these galaxies
are first revisited: they have a high surface brightness
and a limited radius. Interpreting this limited radius
as due to tidal stripping by the neighbour, we adopt a simple
theoretical model, namely and energy-truncated (King, 1966) 
stellar system. Dynamical friction tends to slow down the cE on
its orbit. Several arguments suggest that this orbit is close to circular.
During the decay, only the concentration c=rt/rc of the cE varies.
<p>
For a typical cE, we find a very slow orbital decay rate: about a few
kpc per 10^9 yr. The present mass loss is small, ~ 1 -10 Msol/year.
The merging of cEs into their massive neighbour should happen 
within 10^9 and 10^10 yr.
The small mass loss during the decay implies that progenitors
of cEs had already a low-mass when they arose in the vicinity of
the massive neighbour, either as formed there or after being
captured by it.
We argue that, in the capture case also, the progenitors
were formed with a low mass, ranging between a few times
10^9 and a few times 10^10 Msol.
<p>
This gives strong support for cEs to be related to the low
mass end of the luminosity function of elliptical galaxies: in
particular, cEs could not have evolved from massive ellipticals via
tidal stripping. Therefore isolated low-mass ellipticals should
exist, that resemble cEs.
