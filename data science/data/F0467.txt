<b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>1.1 A brief description of Visual
Basic</font></font></b>
<p><b><font size=-1>VISUAL BASIC</font></b> is a high level programming
language evolved from the earlier DOS version called BASIC. BASIC means
<b>B</b>eginners'
<b>A</b>llpurpose
<b>S</b>ymbolic
<b>I</b>nstruction
<b>C</b>ode.
It is a fairly easy programming language to learn. The codes look a bit
like English Language. Different software companies produced different
version of BASIC, such as Microsoft QBASIC, QUICKBASIC, GWBASIC ,IBM BASICA
and so on.
<p>VISUAL BASIC is a VISUAL and&nbsp; events driven Programming Language.These
are the main divergence from the old BASIC. In BASIC, programming is done
in a text-only environment and the prgram is executed sequentially. In
VISUAL BASIC, programming is done in a graphical environment. Because&nbsp;
users may click on a certain object randomly, so each object has to be
programmed indepently to be able to response to those actions(events).Therefore,
a VISUAL BASIC Program is made up of many subprograms, each has its own
program codes, and each can be excecuted indepently and at the same time
each can be linked together in one way or another.
<p><b><font size=+1>1.2 The Visual Basic Environment</font></b>
<p>On start up, Visual Basic 6.0&nbsp; will display the following dialog
box as shown in figure 1.1.
<br>You can choose to start a new project, open an existing project or
select a list of recently opened programs. A project is a collection of
files that make up your application. There are various types of applications
we could create, however, we shall concentrate on creating Standard EXE
programs(EXE means executable program). Now, click on the Standard EXE
icon to go into the actual VB programming environment.

<br>
<p>In figure 1.2, the Visual Basic Enviroment&nbsp; consists of the
<ul>
<li>
The <b>Blank Form</b> window which you can design your application's interface.</li>

<li>
The <b>Project</b> window&nbsp; displays the files that are created in
your application.</li>

<li>
The <b>Properties</b> window which displays the properties of various controls
and objects that are created in your applications.</li>
</ul>
It also includes a <b>Toolbox</b> that consists of all the controls essential
for developing a VB Application. Controls are tools such as boxes, buttons,
labels and other objects draw on a form to get <b>input</b> or <b>display
output</b>. They also add visual appeal.
