          veteran Sportsman racer Steve Gamble, that fortunate moment occurred 
          7 years ago. At that time Gamble was racing a Bomber car at Saratoga 
          Speedway, and had just blown his only motor. Commiserating with friends 
          over drinks at the Bowser Volunteer Fire Department, Gamble's plight 
          was overheard by fellow volunteer Donna Rix, who suggested that Steve 
          talk to her husband Jim to see if he could help out. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="Driver%20Photos/jimrix.jpg" width="200" height="207" align="right" vspace="6" hspace="6">Even 
          though they had only met casually a few times before, Jim Rix, a former 
          racer and successful geoduck clam fisherman, agreed that same night 
          to finance a new motor for Gamble, and the rest, as they say, is history. 
          Impressed with Gamble's smooth and easy driving style, and attracted 
          by the family atmosphere encouraged by the team, Rix continued to support 
          the team's racing efforts with a modest sponsorship each year as they 
          battled in the local racing wars. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1996, weary of 
          the demanding 20-plus race schedule he was running with the Bombers, 
          Steve made the move to the new Sportsman class. Partnering with Paul 
          Whitby of Horne Lake Auto Wrecking, the team purchased the 1975 Pontiac 
          Ventura formerly campaigned by Western Speedway Stock Car Champion Kory 
          Gronnestad. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although always 
          competitive through the early years of his Sportsman career, Gamble 
          was never able to score that elusive main event victory. As the older 
          steel-bodied Sportsman cars began to be replaced by the sleeker, fiberglass-bodied 
          machines in the late '90s, it was apparent that the technology gap was 
          widening and Gamble and his team felt they were being left behind. Capable 
          in their abilities, their equipment was just too outdated.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Rix, who had purchased 
          a share of the team when Whitby bowed out in 1999, was also getting 
          frustrated. <img src="Driver%20Photos/Gamble_frontshadow.jpg" width="300" height="129" align="right" vspace="6" hspace="6">During 
          the 2000 season he asked Gamble what it would take to win races, and 
          was told it would take a new car. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Undaunted by the 
          prospect of financing the construction of a new, competitive racecar, 
          Rix, who admits he and Donna are very fortunate to have the resources 
          to be able to pursue their passions, came to an agreement with Gamble. 
          Proposing the type of deal just about every racer dreams of, Rix said 
          if Gamble could provide a certain level of financing through sponsorships, 
          he would have a new car built and fund the racing operation for three 
          seasons, with the main goal of winning races and a championship. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Quickly accepting 
          the offer, the newly restructured team contracted Cobble Hill's Randy 
          Price to construct the car, and took delivery of the new machine in 
          December 2000. After several months of preparation and gathering the 
          necessary equipment, Rix, Gamble and the entire Rix Racing <img src="Driver%20Photos/gamble_firstwin.jpg" width="300" height="166" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="6">team 
          were rewarded for their efforts when Steve made a daring last lap pass 
          to win the first Sportsman main event of the 2001 season. Winning another 
          feature race later in the season, Gamble went on to finish a solid second 
          in Sportsman Championship points. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Encouraged by their 
          2001 success and early season testing this year, the team is clearly 
          setting their sights on the 2002 Sportsman Championship. Judging by 
          the results from their first year as Rix Racing, many feel they are 
          poised to unseat 3-time defending champion Tim Christy. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the first race 
          of the 2002 season only days away, we'll know soon enough. </font></p>
