<h1>Ask the Coach - Questions and Answers - 1999</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The number of visitors to the
Coach's Notebook has increased steadily since July, 1999 when it went live
on the internet. Several readers have submitted questions and it seems like a
good idea to share those questions with everyone. The names of those who ask the
questions now on file won't be listed because permission has not been obtained.
How is a question submitted? Easy. Send and email to <a href="mailto:shordan@alaskalife.net">sjordan@alaskalife.net</a>
or&nbsp; just post the question in the Coach's Guestbook. A personal email
response will be sent and the question and answer will be posted on this page
shortly afterwards unless it has been asked before. The Coach's Notebook
reserves the right to not list all submitted questions. You are also invited to post your questions on the <a href="http://www.worldofsports.com/Oct99talk/"
target="_blank">ChalkTalk discussion board</a> and get input from several coaches.</p>

<p><i>The questions immediately below were posted 1/03/00</i>

<h3>I have great ball-handling skills, but I keep getting into trouble against teams that play tough man-to-man defense. How can I improve and reduce my turnovers?</h3>

<p>You just need to pass to escape the pressure. Sounds like
you were double teamed a lot. I tell my kids to give it up before the trap
even happens. The ball will come back. If we see an opponent that dribbles a
lot, we'll go right after him every time. Even a great dribbler will have
turnovers against two smart defenders. But an average dribbler will do
fine by avoiding conflict with an early pass. If two try to play
against you, someone on your team is open. In the long run, you'll be
frustrated trying to solve pressure problems with dribbling. So pass. Its more
fun to make the defense chase the ball anyway, kind of like dogs chasing a
stick. Use your great ball-handling skills in one on one situations if the
defense gets too close.</p>
<h3>My problem now is that 3 of our 7 
players want to OVER-DO a team drill-going 100% instead of 1/2 speed stealing balls when trying to 
teach offensive sets/plays. How do I motivate/teach that to slow down
to learn is a good thing?</h3>

<p>Players will often seek to gain advantage during drills -
that's just good >competitive nature. The answer is to restrict the drill with
special rules. For instance, you might tell your defenders that their hands
must be behind their backs at all times forcing them to play defense using quick
feet and good body position. Offensively, you might tell your players to wait
two seconds (count to before they do anything which gives the rest of the
play time to develop.</p>

<p>Don't detract from the effort. Increase the challenge through various handicaps. 
The closer you focus the drill on a specific behavior, the better. Another idea 
along that line is when you practice rebounding. Set up a half-court scrimmage, 
but the only possible way to score a point is to grab a rebound. The only 
purpose making a basket serves is to put your team back on defense where it is 
possible to get points again.</p>

<h3>Last night we lost a game due to our bad passing. What can I do to motivate them to be better passers? Should we run suicides for making bad passes?</h3>

<p>I don't think punishment will help bad passes - they
probably feel bad enough about losing to be motivated to improve.</p>

<p>Were the passes bad because:</p>
<ol>
<li>They were passing when trapped? If so, the defense knew
where your limited pass options were. Pass before trapped.</li>

<li>Were pass receivers standing still? They should be breaking toward the ball.</li>

<li>Do you use a safety trailing the ball? That's a safer route to reverse the 
ball to the other side of the floor.</li>

<li>Were the passes long? Risk increases with the length of the pass.</li>

<li>What kind of passes were being stolen? Bounce passes are tougher to steal 
than passes lobbed over defenders.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How do I teach the kids to rotate from one man to another depending on other team's offensive 
movement?</h3>
<p>I'll assume you are not running a run and jump m2m, 
and the switching problems happen when the players are screened or beaten off 
the dribble. For switching, you might try a simple rule like
always switch when the ball is near the key and never switch when the ball is
further away than the free throw line. (You determine appropriate boundaries).
That will cut down on confusion. The idea is that the further from the basket, the
more recovery time the defender has. Also, have the players on the weak side
away from the ball sag. Our rule of thumb is, one pass away, put a body part in
the passing lane; two passes away, have a body part in the key. The players in
the key will be able to help with dribble penetrations. An important point ... the beaten 
defender must hustle back and pick up the helper's defender.
Many times they forget.</p>

<p>Use 3 on 3 play to practice switching concepts. Use the shell drill to practice 
the sagging idea. Its good to have the kids feel responsible
for more than their own man. The danger is when they leave their own man to
initiate a double team. They should only help for planned traps or to stop the ball
when penetration occurs.</p>

<p><i>The questions immediately below were posted 11/25/99</i></p>

<h3>When screened, my players just say "Help!" and the opponent just drives by them. 
What should I tell them?</h3>

<p>The easiest advice I have is for the screener's defender to communicate to
his/her teammate being screened so there is some warning. By the time a
defender says help, its probably too late. If the screener's defender calls
out, "pick right, go through" the screened players has warning and a plan.</p>

<p>Some teams have simple rules, like if the pick is high (above the free throw
line, for instance) never switch because there is time for recovery; and always
switch when the pick is low. That's a good idea, too.</p>

<p>Work on communication. Its the basis of good teamwork in any endeavor.</p>

<h3>Sometimes when our player is supposed to set the screen the defender isn't there. 
Where should the screen be set in that case?</h3>
<p>The intended beneficiary of the 
screen must do his part. If he is on the weak side and his man is not near 
him, I would think he needs the ball, not a screen. If his defender is near 
him, he needs to guide the defender into the screen. Problems I see with my 
guys are:  
<ol>
<li>Team is too intent on running pattern and not seeing open 
players</li>
<li>Player to receive screen runs away before screen is set </li>
<li>Player receiving screen cuts too wide around screen and allows defender room 
to go through. </li></ol>
<p>I want my screener to establish a position, not chase a 
defender around. I want the player receiving the screen to be patient, wait, 
then guide his defender into the screen.  When I watch teams run plays, 
I see players going through motions. They set phantom screens that do nothing 
or that are disregarded. Obviously, few openings are created. However, when 
the screens details are consistently applied, the defense gets worn down and 
openings get better and better.</p>

<h3>When you talk about your win-loss 
record, is it the coaches record being referred to or is it the team in 
question?</h3>

<p>In my opinion, coaching records are way over-rated. The kids win or lose 
the game. A great group will make the coach look great. The following year, 
with a different group or in a different league, the same coach may not have 
near as many wins. The coach is the constant, the kids are the variable. 
Some successful coaches are really successful recruiters. Some great, 
but unknown, coaches may be instilling fundamental skills into players that 
go on to make lesser coaches look great.
<p>And, lets be careful about claiming credit for changing kids' lives. The kids do that, too. We share a 
brief time with them and try to share as much as we can in that moment. If 
they're ready and listening, maybe you can add something to their personal 
"playbook". But its up to the kids to have the courage to make a change.</p>

<h3>Can 3rd graders learn a couple of plays, and execute them in a game?</h3>

<p><i>I am coaching a 3rd grade Y-ball boys team this winter in a 3rd/4th grade league.  I believe they will be playing on 10' hoops with a youth
ball.  I was hoping to teach them a couple of simple plays, maybe teach them all the give-and-go, and a pick and roll.  In your experience, can
3rd graders learn a couple of plays, and execute them in a game - of course not every time down, but once in a while?</i></p>

<p>ANSWER: I do believe 3rd graders can run a simple play.
The key is to cover the fundamentals first. Teach them the give and go,
pick and roll and the back door cut. That means allotting time for dribbling
and passing drills. Also, teach them to drive past screens to get shots.
(You can do that simply by running the basic two line layup drill, and add
elements. Have the players in the rebound line grab the rebound, pass back
to the shooting line then set a screen near the free throw line. The player
in the shooting line drives at the screen then diverts either way to shoot
just past the screen).</p>

<p>When you build your play, concentrate on spacing. Tell them how important
it is to stay 10-15" apart. If they find themselves congested, "balance
out" (revert to original spacing).</p>

<p>Choose an easy pattern like the high - low play on the site. In that set,
the big guy starts low and comes up to set picks for the ballhandler. Then
the kids look for those fundmental situations you taught them. The reset of
the movement is really for establishing balance again.</p>

<p>With younger kids, the plays that won't work are ones with a lot of
passing. The players aren't strong enough to avoid lob passes or pass very
far. So, adjust your spacing accordingly.</p>

<p>Don't get frustrated teaching pick and roll, ect. I am still teaching them
to 9th and 10th graders. The plays are easy to learn but difficult to
perfect. Kids just need a coach like you to start them early. We have far
too many kids with playground talent and WEAK fundamentals.</p>


<h3>Regarding &quot;blitz traps&quot; and their effectiveness, have you had any experience
with them?</h3>

<p><i>My definition of blitz traps is when playing tight man to man defense, the player
guarding the ball handler forces that player to reverse their direction or pivot (reverse pivot).  To blitz trap a second defender
would attack from the blind side either the wing or guard.  If they actually turn their back to the defense it works better but some kids
at this level have pretty good ball handling skills.  They either go between their legs or behind their back.  That makes this "Blitz trap
ineffective.</i></p>

<p>ANSWER: Ball handlers in our area are pretty good, too, so when you really spread the floor and try to exert some pressure, you must accept a fair amount of risk. The key is when to trigger the trap. Here are
a few comments that help mitigate the risk...</p>
<ol>
<li>If the ball handler turns his back (a definite no-no) spring the trap</li>
<li>If the ball handler can be guided to the sideline, don't trap until you have the advantage of the out of bounds line.</li>
<li>Often we elect to not try to trap at all until the ballhandler stops dribbling, then trap.</li>
<li>When the ballhandler beats the first defender (head and shoulders go past) then the next two guys on the press need to help out. The closer must leave his 
man/position and stop the dribbler; the other covers the pass lane. The original defender needs to sprint back and take over that vacated spot. 
<li>As always, don't give the ballhandler an escape pass - protect the passing lanes. Its the non-availability of a pass that panics the dribbler.</li> 
<li>If people are beating your press with a dribble, you're in trouble. It should be to your advantage when the ball hits the floor. You might need to work hard
on defensive footwork to quicken those feet. team lose&quot;.</li></ol>

<h3>Do you have drills for zone defense and offense for my team of 6-9 year olds?</h3>

<p>ANSWER: Rather than come up with zone drills, I am going to give you a different
suggestion. Teach your kids man to man fundamentals. The reason I say that is because they will benefit more at that age by learning man to man. If I were
coaching an older team that was small, I would teach them zone, but we would also do man to man. Properly taught, it is the most effective defense. What you teach
them will help them for the rest of their basketball careers.</p>
<p>I have some man to man fundamentals on my site. But, here are some highlights...</p>
<ol>
<li>Always stay between your man and the basket</li>
<li>If your man has not dribbled yet, stay a step away.</li>
<li>Once the opponent dribbles, play as tight as possible</li>
<li>If your man is one pass away, play in the passing lane. That means, don't let your man be open for a pass. This is very important.</li>
<li>If your man is two passes away from the ball, stay near the key to help if the ballhandler gets loose and drives.</li>
<li>If their big player posts up near the basket, have the defender play in front of the big player. The idea is to prevent the pass in. All you need to do is give the appearance of the big player not being open.</li>
<li>Every player must box out for rebounds. Small people can be successful at rebounding if they block out.</li></ol>
<h3>Do you have ideas for selecting players for a 6th grade AAU team?</ol></h3>

<p>ANSWER: My sixth grade tryouts have
always been a situation where I am trying to fill a few open spots rather than
compose an entire team. However, your situation is very similar to our high
school freshmen tryouts where dozens of kids are reviewed for the C team. Beyond
the comments in &quot;Selecting Players&quot;, here are some suggestions that I
hope are appropriate.</p>

<ol>
<li>Look for ambidexterity, dribbling and shooting close to the basket. If you
have some one-handed kids, it will take them a full season of hard work to learn
to use their weak hand effectively. Can you afford that? Proficiency will be
exposed in layup drills and dribbling drills, but look at their preferences
under pressure, like in 3 on 3 play. Another indicator is in passing tendencies
- do they always pass to their strong side. I tell the kids in elementary school
that they have a choice to make now. Pay the price of learning to use both hands
now or forget about playing competitive basketball in high school.</li>
<li>When asking the kids to do drills in the tryouts, I explain and demonstrate
the drill and tell them exactly what I am looking for. For example, on left
handed lay ups, I tell them that I care about form and execution more than
whether the shot goes in. Then I look for who follows direction and is willing
to change behaviors. Some kids will ignore everything I said to make sure they
made the shot. Kids that are willing to change even when they look bad
temporarily are the kids you can work with.</li>
<li>I try to pay attention to the potential team chemistry. The key is to get
the best kids that get along well together. If some candidate is talented but
disliked, that will be a tough problem to resolve during the season. Some groups
of 3 or 4 will seem to really get good results because they have similar styles
and will be able to predict each other's moves.</li>
<li>Have all the kids demonstrate low post moves in a 1:1 environment. Have
them use a drop steps and power dribbles to get their shots. If you have kids
schooled in these basic moves they have probably been well-coached.</li>
<li>Who is willing to box out for rebounds? I give high marks to kids that
like to bang under the boards.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't use 5:5 during tryouts, but I do like 3:3. Each kid has plenty of
opportunity to contribute in the 3:3 game. You might have 6 teams and set up
games at 2 or three baskets. Play to 5 baskets then have the winner rotate to
the nest game. Weaknesses such as improper defensive footwork show up pretty
quickly.</p>
<p>Drills should cover the basic fundamentals. Most kids like to dribble, but
its amazing how many cannot pass well due to poor technique. Decide if you have
the time to teach passing to an otherwise promising prospect.</p>
<p>Work the kids hard with sprints or full court layup drills. Some kids will
simply quit as soon as they get tired. If they start to protest, that's a clue
of what you can expect later on.</p>

<h3>My team doesn't have a good dribbler. How do we beat a team with a good press?</h3>

<p>ANSWER: You won't beat a great press
with a good dribbler. But you'll have a good chance with some decent passers.
Primary advice - stay calm, avoid traps, go to open areas, advance the ball by
passing, not dribbling. Remember, they're taking on the greater risk by
spreading their defense all over the floor. I've seen a lot of good advice in
the coaching boards and various websites. I have a simple press breaker
diagrammed under the topic &quot;<a href="pressbreaker.htm">Press Breakers</a>&quot;.</p>

<h3>Do you have any suggestions for keeping our 6th grade girls interested and motivated?</h3>

<p>ANSWER: Here are some tips that help me when I coach kids in that age range.
<ol>
<li>Don't talk too much. I try to use 1-2 minutes at a time (or less).
best time to talk is when they are winded, like after a conditioning
drill. If you lose eye contact, stop talking.</li>
<li>Ask kids to demonstrate skills. It readily shows what they know and
their peers will have a keen interest.</li>
<li>Hold a scrimmage at the end of practice. Some coaches don't like
this, but if you use the scrimmage to work on what you just practiced,
it is useful.</li>
<li>Make drills into contests. How fast can they run? Time them. How many
shots can be made in a row? Have them count out loud as they do team
layups. Check out the "long-short" shooting drill in the pre-game
section.</li>
<li>Keep the drills short - 10 minutes max. Then move to something new
even if it works the same skill.</li>
<li>When the players get tired and sloppy, stop. Either rest or quit
practice.</li>
<li>Solicit feedback all the time. Are you having fun? Does that help?
Does that feel better?</li>
<li>Quiz them. What is the "baseline"? How many fouls until you get a
bonus? Things like that you feel are appropriate.</li>
<li>If you can find a volunteer, videotape them in practice, then invite
them over to the house to watch their shooting form, etc.</li>
<li>Award silly prizes for extra hustle or accomplishments in practice.</li></ol>

<h3>Would you define the 5 positions on the court and their
responsibilities?</h3>

<p>ANSWER: Typically, a basketball team is broken into 5 positions for the purpose
of defining who does what in a play. There is a lot of interpretation
about the roles, but that's the fun of being coach - you decide who does
what and there is no need to get too hung up on numbers.</p>

<p>Usually you can define the positions by the player's size. The 1 is the
point guard and 5 is the center. Of course, size isn't important but
that is usually how it goes. The normal roles:</p>

<ol><li>point guard - brings the ball upcourt, especially against a press. Sets
up the offense. Starts plays from the top of the key. Usually a ball
distributor more than a shooter. On a press, usually is the first
defender on the ball.</li>

<li>shooting guard - generally sets up for outside shots, often receives
the first pass from the point guard. Helps bring up the ball. On a
press, usually is an early defender on the ball.</li>

<li>Small forward or big guard. Also called a swingman. Often sets
screens. On a press, plays middle of the floor.</li>

<li>Big forward - Many teams have this player pass the ball into play.
Plays post positions on offense.</li>

<li>Center  - Your biggest player. Plays post position of offense and
always near the basket on defense. On set plays, you look to get this
player the ball inside.</li></ol>

<p>These are all generalities. Sometimes it helps to assign the numbers so
the players can identify themselves when they look at a play diagram.</p>

<h3>What are some good full court drills that incorporate passing and defense
skills. Like a full court 2 on 3.</h3>

<p>ANSWER: For full
court conditioning and practice of ballhandling, passing and defensive
skills, I like the following:</p><ol>
<li>Full court 3 man weave, but the shooter must sprint back to the start
point and defend against the two players he just worked with.</li>

<li>3 man weave. There is a fourth line, too. That line sends a man all
the way&nbsp; downcourt while the 3 man weave is in progress. He and the
shooter return for defense.</li>

<li>Alternatives include 4 man weave or a fourth and fifth line that run
down in the outside lanes then back for defense.</li></ol>

<h3>I coach 5th and 6th graders. What's a good way to teach them which foot to jump off for layups?</h3>

<p>ANSWER: About layups, you always jump off the leg opposite the shooting hand. So, if
you're shooting with your right hand, jump off your left foot. Another way to
think of it is to jump off the leg closest to the basket and shoot with hand
furthest from  the basket.</p>

<p>Shooting layups well with either hand is a very important skill. It is not easy
to learn, but if you work on it every practice, by the end of the season some
players will be doing it naturally. That's when you can pat yourself on the
back. Tell them that if they do not learn to shoot layups with both hands now,
they will have a very hard time making a junior high team and definitely have a
hard time making a high school team.</p>

<p>One drill to do is have them line up single file and drive to the basket
without a ball. Then they pretend to shoot and concentrate on jumping off the
proper foot. The ball tends to complicate things. After many repetitions,
introduce the ball to the drill and see what happens. Make it fun by showing
them how high they got off the floor with each attempt.</p>

<p>My son suggests imagining a string tied from your elbow to your knee. When
the right hand goes up, so does the right knee as you jump off the left foot.</p>

<p>Many kids have a hard time balancing the ball in their weak hand, and therefore
its impossible for them to shoot. To help that, they will need to get a partner
and practice taking one step and a shot (no dribble) and bank the layup in. The
partner helps with rebounds and trades position when the shooter tires.  In
time, they will develop the strength and coordination they need.</p>

<p>The boys I have coached at that level have learned to shoot either way within
one season, but it took some of them all season. The point is, after that, they
own that shot for life.</p>
