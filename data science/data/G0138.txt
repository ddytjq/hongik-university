This lesson plan is meant to be used for undergraduates
studying astronomy to supplement to an existing introductory astronomy
course.  As such, it may   guide the instructor in preparing her/his own
lecture or be distributed and read by the   class.  Students reading this
lesson plan / lecture might need to do some background reading   on astronomy
to understand some of the terms and concepts used.  Any good   introductory
astronomy textbook should be able to fill this role.  For more detailed
background material on the Curtis - Shapley debate, both students and
teachers are urged   to access the 75th Anniversary Astronomical Debate
home page on the World Wide Web   with URL: <p>

The information provided includes a glossary relevant to the 1920 debate,
the actual   submitted transcripts of the 1920 debate, and a bibliography
citing several good sources   that review the `Great Debate' and the
surrounding times. 

<p>
  
The historical material presented in this lesson plan and accessed through
the World   Wide Web home page is accurate to the best of our knowledge. 
There are some distinct   subjective comments in this work, however, and
there should not be taken as indicative   of anyone other than ourselves. 
The need to summarize events and issues relevant to the   `Great Debate'
may lead readers to perceive mis-characterizations or oversights for which 
 we apologize in advance.  Interested readers are urged to consult the
original sources   presented in the bibliographies to form their own
mis-characterizations and oversights   which they feel are more
representative of the truth!

<h3> Lesson Plan Objectives: </h3>
  
<p>

An important objective is to give students a sense of the scope of
humanity's   efforts to find a place in the Universe.  This quest has a
long history and is closely   connected with societies' abilities to make
observations and interpret them according to   current beliefs and
prejudices. 
  
<p>

A central objective in detailing the events and issues surrounding the
Curtis - Shapley debate is to illustrate how scientific progress is made. 
Scientific theories are   subjected to rigorous tests to determine which
are right and which are wrong, but the   results of these tests themselves
are often controversial and must be interpreted.  We look   back on the
Curtis-Shapley debate with a historical perspective and have different  
interpretations of the results.  Neither Curtis nor Shapley was entirely
right or wrong and   both presented ideas which represented major advances.
What does this imply for  current scientific controversies? 
  
<p>

A further objective in studying some of the arguments used by both
astronomers in the debate is to provide a practical example of how two
very successful scientists interpreted observations and data and tried to
synthesize a coherent overall picture.  Each suspected that some of the
data available to them was misleading or wrong.  Each was forced to
choose, without the benefit of historical hindsight. 
  
<p>

The ultimate objective of the lesson plan is to familiarize students with a
little known historical event, `The Great Debate', which brought into focus
philosophical and scientific thought, discoveries, and advances which had a
profound effect on humanity's subsequent perception of the Universe. 
  
<hr> 
  
<h3> Lesson Plan Requirements </h3>
  
The concepts of our solar system, stars, and galaxies are fundamental to  
understanding the information presented here.  Students need to have a
general picture of what the Universe is like according to 20th Century
astronomy.  More advanced students will benefit from an appreciation of
topics related to modern astronomical techniques for distance
determination such as trigonometric parallaxes and Cepheid variables. 
Other recommended topics are novae, globular clusters, and spiral
galaxies.  Any good introductory astronomy text book should be able to
provide information on these topics at an appropriate level. 
  
<p>
  
<h3> Class Room Use </h3>
  
It is intended that the following lecture be used as background material
for one or more class room lectures or that it be distributed to students
as a reading assignment.  A bibliography is also supplied for instructor
and/or student use.  Suggested class activities can include responding to
questions presented at the end of the lecture, or for the brave and the
motivated, the preparation of a similar scientific debate.  Students should
concentrate on choosing an appropriate topic and detailing what issues
might be involved.  What are the implications of the possible outcomes?

<h2> The Universe and the Curtis - Shapley Debate: Lecture </h2>

<p> 
  
<h3> A Mediocre Discussion? </h3>

<p> 
  
Does it really matter that two astronomers debated each other near the
beginning of this century?  It is now clear that a once little-heard-of
discussion was at the crux of a major change of humanity's view of our
place in the universe.  The events that happened in the first quarter of
our century were together much more than a debate - this is a story of
humanity's discovery of the vastness of our universe, a story of a
seemingly small academic disagreement whose dramatic resolution staggered
the world.  It is a story of human drama - two champion astronomers
struggling at the focus of a raging controversy who's solution represents
an inspiring synthesis of old and new ideas.  It is the story of  
monumental insight and tragic error.  It is a story of an astronomical
legend.  Does this sound melodramatic?   It s all true.  And it happened
this century. 

<p> 
  
In 1920 Harlow Shapley was a young ambitious astronomer.  He had published
a   series of papers marking several fascinating astronomical discoveries -
many times   involving properties of stars in binary systems or globular
clusters.  He was a rising star   himself - a  golden boy  of astronomy. 

<p> 
  
In 1920 Heber D. Curtis was a bit older, more established, and very
well   respected in his own right.  He had published a series of solid
papers on good   astronomical results - many times on the properties of
spiral nebulae.  He was a `rock of   clear thinking' to all that knew him. 
He was a hard worker usually taking the   conservative view - frequently
skeptical of anything new until proven to his exacting   standards.. 

<p> 
  
By now you know they are going to clash in a historic debate in 1920. 
Do you   want to know who was right even before you know the issues?  Was
it the prodigy or the   pro?  OK, we'll tell you: they split.  Each was
right about some things and wrong about   others.   Shapley, the prodigy,
made a monumentally correct deduction from existing   astronomical data
that our Sun was not at the center of our Galaxy and that our Galaxy   was
much larger than anyone had previously believed.  Curtis vigorously opposed
these   views, but Shapley, like Copernicus before him, single-handedly
moved the center of the   universe, this time light-years from its old
location.  Harlow Shapley lived up to his   potential.  But possibly the
biggest surprise came from the Curtis, the pro.  Curtis was   able to argue
convincingly - for the first time from hard scientific data - that spiral  
nebulae were external galaxies and that our own Galaxy was only one of a
vast number   of galaxies, or `island universes'.  Shapley saw this
viewpoint as contrary to his large   Galaxy idea.  Curtis' accomplishment
is impressive, representing an unprecedented   redefinition of humanities
concept of the universe, but he did not do it alone.  He led a   school of
thought that had supported the island universe idea both philosophically
and   scientifically for more than 100 years.  So Heber Curtis lived up to
his reputation. 

<p> 
  
The complete scientific resolution of all the issues involved in the
debate   occurred slowly over the next two decades. At the time, not
everybody realized  what far-   reaching implications the resolution of
this debate would bring.  In the years following   the debate, Curtis was
appointed Director of the Allegheny Observatory and then went on   to
become the Director of the Observatories at the University of Michigan. 
Shapley was   appointed Director of the Harvard College Observatory. 

<p> 
     
In actuality, the term `Great Debate' best applies to the actual
running   disagreement on the nature of our Galaxy and the nature of spiral
nebulae that raged from   the turn of the century through the 1930s.  This
"debate" was between many different   astronomers scattered around the
globe, using data and results from many instruments,   and took decades to
resolve.  It was truly Homeric.   The term `Great Debate' is usually  
applied, however, to the actual meeting of Curtis and Shapley in 1920, an
event which   served as a focal point for the controversy. 

<p> 
  
<h3> A Brief History of the Center of the Universe </h3>

<p> 
  
It is difficult, with the naked eye, to see anything that is not in
our Milky Way   Galaxy.  Every individual star one can see is in our
Galaxy.  From Earth's Southern   Hemisphere, one could see large fuzzy
patches called the Large and Small Magellanic   Clouds that are satellite
galaxies to our own Milky Way, and in the Northern Hemisphere   a dim fuzzy
patch call the Andromeda Galaxy, M31, is visible if one knows where to  
look, but that's it - everything else visible is in our home Galaxy. 

<p> 
  
If you have a telescope or another means of seeing fainter objects,
the situation   changes completely.  But astronomers did not always have
telescopes.  Humanity didn't   always know the limits of our Galaxy and the
existence of other galaxies - this   knowledge came only this century  -
what was thought previously? 

<p> 
  
While it is certainly true that early civilizations had a drastically
different picture   of the universe, their concepts were sophisticated and
completely consistent with their   ability to observe the universe, just as
ours are today.  Early Greek civilization recorded   evidence that the
earth was spherical based on observations of  the circular Earth shadow  
on the moon during a lunar eclipse.  The Greek scientist Erasthothenes was
able to obtain   a rough estimate of the size of the earth by noting the
relative lengths of shadows cast at   different locations at the same time.
 So at that time the center of the Universe was   thought to lie about 9000
km down - the distance they computed to the center of the   earth. 

<p> 
  
The earth was considered the center of the universe because the
leading theory   about this at the time came from the Greek astronomer
Claudius Ptolemy in about 140   A.D.  In this theory, the earth was at the
center of the universe, and the sun, the moon,   the planets  and stars
orbited the earth. 

<p> 
  
The center of the universe remained at the center of the earth, in the
view of the   majority of the scientific community, until the 1500s. 
Occasionally there were those who   suggested otherwise, the most famous of
which is Aristarchus of Samos, a Greek scientist   well-ahead of his time,
but he, unfortunately, was not taken very seriously for very long. 

<p> 
  
The successful challenge to the earth-centered universe was begun by
the Polish   Astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus in 1543.  In his book De
Revolutionibus, he argued that   the Sun was at the center of the solar
system (and hence universe), and that the planets -   including the earth -
revolved around the sun.  This heliocentric theory provided a  
conceptually simpler explanation for certain peculiar `retrograde' motions
of the planets   than the Ptolemaic geocentric theory but encountered stiff
resistance from those who felt   it was heretical to move humanity so far
from the center of the universe. 

<p> 
  
The Italian Scientist Galileo Galilei greatly supported Copernicus's
sun centered   universe.  In his book Sidereus Nuncius of 1610, Galileo
bolstered this view with some   of the first astronomical observations with
a telescope.  He was able to trace the motions   of four bright moons as
they orbited Jupiter, stunning visual proof that not all objects in   the
universe orbited the Earth as Ptolemy required.  He was also able to see
that many   regions of the night sky that appeared fuzzy and nebulous to
the unaided eye actually   consisted of many individual stars when viewed
through the telescope.  Although forced   to recant in his lifetime, his
observations and analysis soon led to the recognition the   Earth and
planets orbited our sun which was one of many stars, and that the band of
the   Milky Way was a band of stars.  In the centuries which followed,
larger telescopes were   used to explore the newly revealed universe of
stars.  By the time of the Curtis - Shapley   Debate in 1920, through the
arduous technique of star counts, astronomers had tried to   map out the
extent of the Milky Way.  This work still placed the sun close to the
center   of a flattened universe of stars and so the center of the universe
arguably  remained at the   center of the sun until the resolution of the
Curtis - Shapley debate. 

<p> 
  
Strangely enough, acceptance of Einstein's General Theory of
Relativity and   popular cosmologies derived from it led to the view that
each part of the Universe was   expanding from all others quite similarly,
so that the modern view is that there IS no   unique center of the
Universe.  Acceptance of this did not take place until after Hubble's  
discovery that the universe was expanding in the 1930s. 
  
<p> 
  
<h3> A Brief History of the Size of the Universe </h3>

<p> 
  
The history of the size of the universe closely follows the history of
the center of   the universe.  With the discovery that the earth was round,
the size of the universe   expanded to the size of the solar system.  The
estimated size of the solar system also   evolved as astronomical knowledge
crept forward in the middle ages.  The distance to the   furthest planet in
the solar system became separated from the size of the universe as   people
questioned why the stars did not move like the planets.  The stars and
everything   else in the night sky were delegated to a great sphere that
encompassed the solar system.   There were no truly scientific estimates of
the radius of this sphere - only folklore.  Even   the distance to Saturn,
the most distant planet known to `pre-telescopic' astronomers, was   not
well determined until the time of Kepler.  In truth, the distances to stars
were just too   large for direct trigonometric measurements (parallax) even
in the 1500s. 

<p>
  
Kepler, a contemporary of Galileo, studied data taken in the years
before by   Tycho Brahe and postulated three laws of motion for the
planets.  These laws of motion   allowed an accurate estimate of the
distances to the planets, hence an accurate estimate of   the size of the
solar system and hence that day's conception of the size of the universe. 

<p>
  
At about the same time, the generally accepted view that everything
seen in the   night sky was contained in our solar system sized universe
fell away.  The telescopes in   use from the  time of Galileo caused
recognition that stars were at much greater distances   than even the
furthest planets of our solar system. 

<p> 
  
In the mid-1700s, the English astronomer Thomas Wright suggested that
two   concentric spheres existed outside the solar system, and that between
these spheres   existed all stars and our sun and solar system.  By looking
along the shell we saw the   band of the Milky Way, and looking
perpendicular to it just the few stars between us and   the boundary of the
shell.  The size of the shell and hence the size of the universe was not  
well determined in this model. 

<p> 
  
In the late 1700s Immanual Kant revised Wright's model, based partly
on a   misinterpretation, to suggest a Galaxy with dynamics like the solar
system.  In this model   the stars rotated about the center of the Galaxy
just as the planets revolved around the   center of the sun.  Kant's even
suggested that the faint nebulae seen may be composed of   individual
stars.  Although Kant considered that the sun's distance from the center
may   be great, he did not estimate this distance, and did not estimate the
size of this universe.   Kant's thoughts were not taken as scientific
proof, but could be considered the start of the   controversies at the
heart of the Curtis - Shapley debate. 

<p>
  
William Hershel set out to determine the size of the universe
scientifically in the   late 1700s.  Using a new telescope with a 48-inch
mirror, he counted stars in several   directions, assumed a uniform star
density, and hence estimated the distances needed to   count so many stars
in these directions.  Thus, along specific directions in space he could  
determine the relative extent of the universe of stars.  Like Galileo,
Hershel also noted   that some nebulous objects could be resolved into
stars and believed for a while that all   nebular objects could be so
resolved. 

<p>
  
Progress then had to wait for the development of larger telescopes. 
In the mid-   1800s, William Parsons, the Earl of Rosse, began using a
72-inch diameter telescope.  He   was able to resolve structure in some of
the nebula as spiral structure, and thus conclude   again that these were
stellar systems like Kant had proposed 70 years before.  Still,   however,
no one could estimate the distance to any of these nebulae, so the size of
the   universe remained unclear.  The theory that spiral nebulae were
separate `universes' unto   themselves became known as the `island universe
theory.' 

<p>
  
At the turn of the century, the Dutch astronomer Jacobus Kapteyn used
the latest   data of the day to postulate a model for the Galaxy - and the
universe in his eyes - that   consisted of a flattened stellar system 10
kiloparsecs (30,000 light years) in diameter and   2 kiloparsecs (6,000
light years) in thickness.  He placed the sun near the center of this  
universe.  Kapteyn used the parallax method to calibrate the distance to
the nearest stars,   and proper motions and apparent brightnesses to
estimate the distances to successively   further stars.  Kapteyn's
extensive application of the method of star counts used by   Herschel also
confirmed his results for the dimensions of the Galaxy, or `Kapteyn's  
Universe' as it was called. 

<p>
  
From the turn of the century to 1920, the controversy which inspired
the `Great Debate' that would occur in 1920 was on.  Many articles were
published reporting   evidence that spiral nebulae were separate galaxies
like our own and at significant   distances.  Many discussions were held on
the what new data indicated for the size of our   Galaxy.  Astronomers'
view of the size of the universe and our place in it was in a state   of
flux.  On the external galaxy issue,  most astronomers believed that spiral
nebulae   were external galaxies until Harlow Shapley led one last final
assault on this idea. 

<p>

<h3> Shapley's View of our Galaxy and the Universe in 1920 </h3>

<p>
  
In 1918 and 1919 Shapley published articles in the Astrophysical
Journal   elucidating a new model for the Galaxy.  Basing his model on the
asymmetric   distribution of globular clusters, Shapley estimated that the
diameter of our Galaxy was   100 kiloparsecs, 10 times larger that
Kapteyn's value.  Shapley also placed the center of   the Galaxy some 20
kiloparsecs distant from the Sun, a drastic, dramatic shift in location.  
In his view, this large meta-Galaxy was the universe and the spiral nebulae
were simply   one relatively minor population of mostly gaseous objects
contained within it. 

<p>
  
Shapley was a leader in the area of observing and understanding
globular clusters,   but he was not the first to notice that the
distribution of globular clusters on the sky is not   uniform.  A plot of
the positions of Globular clusters on the sky shows that they are  
concentrated more toward one half of the sky.  Shapley conjectured that
this half of the   sky housed the true center of our Galaxy.  In 1909,
another astronomer, Bohlin, suggest   similar arguments which were not
seriously considered.  What Shapley had done that   Bohlin had not was to
determine approximate distances to the globular clusters, and thus   give a
distance of our Sun from the Galactic center.  Shapley used Cepheid
variables in   the globular clusters to help make this distance
determination. 

<p>
  
Shapley also felt it necessary, however, to comment on the nature of
spiral   nebulae.  Shapley thought that the Galaxy was so large it was
essentially the whole   universe.  Shapley not only based his opinion on
the distribution of globular clusters and   the distances to globular
clusters, but on the apparently measured rotation velocities of   spiral
nebulae. 

<p>
  
In the 1910s and 1920s, Adriaan Van Maanen, an astronomer at Mount
Wilson   Observatory and friend of Shapley's, measured the internal
rotational motion of several   spiral nebulae.  Measuring small motions,
called proper motions, of astronomical objects   was Van Maanen's task at
Mount Wilson, and he was well known for having successfully   measured the
proper motions of nearby stars.  Van Maanen measured motion in seconds   of
arc per year, an angular rate of motion, by comparing photographs of the
same region   of the sky taken years apart.  Knowing the distance to the
spiral nebulae would allow the   conversion of his measured angular rate of
rotation to a rotational velocity in kilometers   per second.  The
distances to the spiral nebulae were not known but Shapley argued that   if
the nebulae were placed well outside the boundaries of the Galaxy, as
Curtis and others   had suggested, the rotational velocities implied would
be a substantial fraction of the   speed of light!  This was an
unreasonable result and thus he argued that the real distances   to the
spiral nebulae must be closer to bring their implied rotational velocities
in to a   physically acceptable range. 

<p>
  
Shapley also did not believe that spiral nebulae were galaxies in
their own right.   At the time of the Great Debate, he thought that spiral
nebula were gaseous clouds   repelled by the light pressure of our Galaxy
and that our Galaxy was moving through   these clouds. That spirals were
racing away from us was a result of the spectroscopic   observations made
by Slipher.  Shapley thought that his postulated great extent for our  
Galaxy precluded spirals from being galaxies in their own right. 
  
<p>

<h3> Curtis's View of our Galaxy and our Universe in 1920 </h3>
  
Curtis presented a different view in his scientific publications of
the 1910s and   1920s and at the debate in 1920.  He followed the more
traditional views of Kapteyn and   believed that the diameter of our Galaxy
was more nearly 10 kpc, much smaller than   Shapley's estimate.  This was
based on star count analysis and distance estimates   involving the
spectral types and intrinsic brightnesses of different type stars.  He also
believed that our Galaxy was shaped like a flat lens with our sun very
close to the center.   According to Curtis, spiral nebula were systems of
stars - island universes similar to our   own. 

<p>
  
Curtis followed several lines of thought to conclude that spiral
nebula were   galaxies.  He argued that novae observed in our Galaxy were
similar to novae observed   in spiral nebulae, implying that the nebulae
were very distant - and composed of stars.   Curtis cited Slipher's
spectroscopic measurements of high radial velocities for the   nebulae as
further evidence that they were not galactic objects which would be moving 
 much more slowly relative to the sun.  In his view, the apparent sizes of
the spiral   nebulae were consistent with Kapteyn's dimensions for a galaxy
when the nebulae were   located at extragalactic distances.  Photographs of
some of the spiral nebulae also   revealed bands of absorbing material
which Curtis interpreted as being consistent with   absorbing material he
believed existed at the edge of our own Galaxy. 

<p>
  
The main reason Curtis gave for disagreeing with Shapley's model of
the Galaxy   was that he did not believe that Cepheid variables were good
distance indicators.  He   therefore did not believe the distances Shapley
gave for globular clusters, and hence did   not believe Shapley's distance
to the center of the Galaxy. 

<p>
  
Furthermore, Curtis did not believe van Maanen's measurements of the
rotations   of spiral nebulae.  He pointed out that these measurements
involved angular motions   much smaller than had ever been measured, and
were unrealistically small to measure. 
  
<p>

<h3> What was Said at the Great Debate </h3>

<p>
  
It has been said that the `Great Debate' of 1920 was neither `great'
nor a `debate.'   But wait, wasn't it said previously that it was?  The
actual debate between Shapley and   Curtis was, in fact, not well
publicized at the time, not well attended by astronomers, and   did not
take the form of a debate.  Have we all been duped? 

<p>
  
To be sure, what occurred was not truly a debate - each person gave a
40 minute   presentation and was given one opportunity to rebut the other's
remarks.  After these   remarks, several comments were made from the floor,
including a substantial comment   from Henry Norris Russell, arguably the
most famous astronomer of the day, in support   of Shapley. 

<p>
  
The debate was held as a public event during the 1920 meeting of the
National   Academy of Sciences.  It was held in the main auditorium of the
Natural History   Museum, then the U.S. National Museum, in Washington,
D.C. on April 26. The   auditorium, still in use today, is now known as the
Baird Auditorium.  Most of the   attendees were members of the National
Academy of Sciences but not astronomers, but   several prominent
astronomers did attend.  Harlow Shapley implies in his autobiography  
"Through Rugged Ways to the Stars" that Albert Einstein was in attendance. 

<p>
  
Shapley spoke first and gave a popular level lecture.  Curtis
followed, but gave a   more technical lecture.  Shapley's popular lecture
was geared toward the audience of   mostly non-astronomers.  His approach
was to educate them with the basic background   material, finally using
only simple arguments to support his position. Shapley   concentrated on
convincing the audience that his model of our Galaxy and its size were  
more nearly correct than Curtis'.  He only briefly mentioned his views on
the distances to   spiral nebulae near the end of his lecture. 

<p>
  
Curtis tried to create the best logical argument from the data, not
trying to fill in   all the background.  He gave a more detailed
presentation of the present state of research,   as he saw it, and focused
most strongly on the distances and nature of spiral nebulae,   frequently
posting comparative tables outlining how spiral nebulae made more sense as 
 galaxies in their own right..

<h3> Who Won? </h3>
  
<p>

It is not really scientifically important who `won' the debate at the
time.  It was   the underlying arguments and conclusions used by Shapley
and Curtis that are held up to   modern scientific scrutiny - not a
hypothetical straw pole of an audience that consisted of   mostly
non-astronomers.  Nevertheless who won is of human interest and so we will 
speculate on this point: 

<p>
  
If a straw pole had been taken at the actual debate, we believe Curtis
would have   won.  Notes from people who attended, Curtis' letter to his
family about the event, and   Shapley's eventual guarded characterization
of the event as a `draw' all tend to support   this conclusion.  But who
won is a subjective estimate.  More importantly, how have the   scientific
arguments withstood the test of time?  Looking back, whose arguments and  
conclusions were more scientifically correct? 

<p>
  
Scientifically the debate was close to a draw.  There are several
popular   misconceptions about this, even in the modern scientific
community.  The first   misconception is that Shapley won.  Astronomers who
have not studied the debate   sometimes assume this because Shapley went on
to become the more famous astronomer.   A second misconception is that
Curtis won.  Astronomers who believe this have a   tendency to believe that
the only scientific issue at hand was the nature of the spiral   nebulae -
a point which Curtis won hands-down. 

<p>
  
But each was correct on a major point, and each was incorrect on a
major point.   Shapley was correct that our sun was well off from the
center of our Galaxy.  Let's not   take this point lightly.  He, like
Copernicus before him, had moved humanity's place in   the cosmos far away
from where it was previously.   As Copernicus had moved it from   the Earth
to the Sun, Shapley moved it, almost single-handedly, from the Sun to the  
center of the Galaxy.  This in itself is truly historic.  Shapley was also
correct that our   Galaxy was much bigger than Kapteyn had hypothesized
previously.  Another major   point where Shapley was correct was about the
usefulness of Cepheid variables as   distance indicators.  The distance
scale of the Galaxy he obtained from them was too   large but not far off
by astronomical standards - and Cepheids continue to be   cornerstones of
our knowledge of distances to further objects even today.  Harlow   Shapley
was a great astronomer. 
  
<p>

Curtis, however, was correct that spiral nebulae are external
galaxies.  This was   the first time this was shown with valid scientific
evidence, and this point in itself is also   truly historic.  In fact,
there is no precedent for this - it is an accomplishment that is   unique
in history.  So Heber Curtis was also a great astronomer. Curtis was also
correct   that van Maanen's measurements of the rotation of these nebulae
were inaccurate.  In   view of his arguments against using Cepheids as
distance scale indicators, it is ironic that   this point was ultimately
settled in his favor by Hubble's discovery of Cepheids in the   Andromeda
Nebula several years after the debate. 

<p>
  
Shapley and Curtis were also wrong about some things.   Shapley was
completely   wrong about spiral nebulae - they are exactly as Curtis had
argued (and many had   surmised, including Kant before him).   Shapley was
also somewhat incorrect on the size   of our Galaxy, which he estimated to
be larger than it really is.  Curtis was wrong about   some things too. 
Curtis was wrong about the Sun's place in the galaxy - it is not near the  
center as he estimated from star count analyses like those of Kapteyn. 
Curtis was wrong   about Cepheids - they do indeed show a period -
luminosity law somewhat similar to that   Shapley had computed, and they
continue to be useful distance indicators.  Curtis was   wrong about the
size of our Galaxy - it is larger than he estimated - Shapley was more  
nearly correct on this point. 

<p>
  
Oddly enough, Curtis and Shapley were BOTH wrong on some issues that
they   agreed upon.  The most major of these points was on interstellar
absorption of starlight.   Both agreed that interstellar absorption was not
important in determining the size of the   Galaxy.  Today we know
interstellar absorption is extremely important.  Curtis did   realize that
some spiral nebulae seen edge-on were dark along their leading edge - which
  he correctly attributed to interstellar absorption.  But Curtis thought
that this only   occurred at the edge of galaxies, and so was not important
for determining distances   internal to our Galaxy.  Oddly, Curtis surmised
that since no globular clusters were seen   in our Galactic plane, that
globular clusters could not be inside our Galaxy - and used this   to argue
against Shapley's large Galaxy hypothesis! 

<p>
  
It is interesting to estimate who won on the point of the title of the
debate: "The Scale of the Universe."  Shapley defined the universe at
that time to be the local Galaxy,   and his estimate of the size of our
Galaxy was more nearly correct than Curtis'.  Curtis   would define the
Universe as all that is - which includes spiral galaxies - so that the  
whole of the universe has much greater scale than just that of our Galaxy. 
So on this   point Curtis, too, could be considered more correct. 

<p>
  
Shapley did not consider the debate to be about the distances to
spiral nebulae.   He considered this to be a side point on the greater
issue of the just how large our Galaxy   was.  He considered it somewhat
unfair that Curtis made this such a major point.  Curtis   considered the
distances and nature of spiral nebula to be a major point in the debate. 
So   we see that they didn't even agree on what they were disagreeing on! 

<p>
  
Whose arguments went on to have greater lasting impact?  Shapley's
placement of   our sun away from the Galactic center surely is a major
accomplishment, as been stated   several times previously.  But the
discovery that spiral nebulae are galaxies just like our   own is possibly
without parallel.  It is of dramatic importance in the big scheme of  
defining human existence.  It is possibly the major reason why the Curtis -
Shapley   debate will never be forgotten.  Future historians will always
want to learn about the time   that humanity learned there was a whole
universe of galaxies out there, and so they will   always be drawn to this
focal point of this disagreement: the Curtis - Shapley debate.   The study
of galaxies in the universe continues to be a ground-breaking field in  
astronomy even today, and has numerous different sub-branches. 

<p>  

Which scientist personally had greater scientific impact?  This answer
is   particularly subjective, but we would venture Shapley.  Curtis and
Shapley each   represented the points of view of many astronomers, and each
did contribute original   research to their respective view-points. 
Possibly, though, Shapley contributed greater   original research to the
view-points he represented than did Curtis for his.  There were   others
besides Curtis who probably could have argued most of what Heber Curtis did
at   the `Great Debate.'  But probably nobody could have taken Shapley's
place.  Curtis led a   movement of many astronomers who had been guessing
that spiral nebulae were galaxies   for more than 100 years.  But Shapley
was one of the first to argue that the Sun is well   away from the Galactic
center, and that Cepheids are valuable astronomical tools for   distance
estimation.  Shapley won several impressive battles almost single-handedly,
while Curtis led an army to win on a truly epic point. 

<p>
  
<h3> The Resolution of the Great Debate </h3>
  
<p> 

In 1924 Edwin Hubble located Cepheid variables in the nearest major
spiral   nebulae, M31.  This had immediately followed a period where stars
in this nebulae were   being resolved.  When confronted with this evidence
Shapley immediately admitted he   was wrong on the spiral nebulae issue -
an issue that he did not consider at the heart of   the 1920 debate. 

<p>
  
During the 1920s and 1930s, evidence mounted that interstellar
absorption was   important and also that Cepheids were indeed good distance
indicators.  This allowed the   astronomical community to understand why
globular clusters were not visible in the   galactic plane (their light was
being absorbed) and allowed for a better calibration of   distance
indicators.  These led to acceptance that the globular clusters
distribution was   indeed centered on the center of our Galaxy - just as
Shapley had claimed.  They also led   to a better understanding of the size
of our Galaxy which showed again that Shapley was   more nearly correct.

<h2> The 1995 Diamond Jubilee Debate </h2> 
  
<p> 

In 1995 there is planned a debate in commemoration of the 1920 `Great
Debate.'   Historically, it is planned to occur 4 days before the exact
75th anniversary of the `Great   Debate' and in exactly the same location. 

<p>
  
This 1995 debate is over gamma ray bursts (GRBs).  GRBs are huge
flashes of   gamma-radiation first detected by US defense satellites in the
1960s.  Bohdan Paczynski,   a Professor at Princeton has been endorsing a
cosmological origin for these mysterious   flashes.  Donald Q. Lamb, a
Professor at the University of Chicago, has  been endorsing   a Galactic
origin for these GRBs.  Some see many analogies between the `Great Debate' 
 of 1920 and the pending `Diamond Jubilee Debate' of 1995.  The most
compelling of   these analogies is that with spiral nebulae.  Curtis lead
the movement in 1920 backing   spiral nebulae as galaxies at `cosmological
distances' while Paczynski in seen by many   to lead a similar movement for
the origins of GRBs today.  Shapley felt spiral nebulae   were in our
Galaxy - as Lamb has been at the forefront arguing about GRBs. 

<p> 
  
But both disagreements involve discovery at the cutting edge of
science.  As Dr.   Frank Shu states in his book "The Physical Universe, An
Introduction to Astronomy:"   "The Shapley - Curtis debate makes
interesting reading even today.  It is important, not   only as a
historical document, but also as a glimpse into the reasoning processes of 
 eminent scientists engaged in a great controversy for which the evidence
on both sides is   fragmentary and partly faulty.  The debate illustrates
forcefully how tricky it is to pick   one's way successfully through the
treacherous ground that characterized research at the   frontiers of
science."

<p> 
  
1. List 3 scientific issues that were disagreed on during the Shapley -
Curtis debate.

2. How did Shapley determine which direction the center of the galaxy was? 
How did he   estimate our distance from the center? 

<p> 
  
3. What are Cepheid variables?  How were they important in the Shapley -
Curtis debate?   Extra-credit: In what ways are Cepheid variables important
today? 

<p>
  
4. Describe Kapteyn's model for our Galaxy.  How did Shapley's view differ?

<p>
  
5. What evidence did Heber Curtis use to show spiral nebulae were
external galaxies at   the 1920 debate? 

<p>
  
6. What evidence did Edwin Hubble use to show that spiral nebulae were
external   galaxies in 1924? 

<p>
  
7. (Math involved) Both Copernicus and Shapley might be credited with
`moving' humanity's perception of where the center of the universe was. 
Which moved the center   by a greater factor? 

<p>
  
8.  (Math involved) How much larger did the observable universe become when
Curtis   was eventually proved right about spiral nebulae being galaxies? 

<p>
  
9. (Math involved) Van Maanen claimed to have measured proper motions for

<p>
  
10. (Math involved) Find the apparent angular size of M31 and the
apparent angular size   of the smallest galaxies visible in 1920.  How much
further away were the smallest   galaxies than the largest galaxies, in
Curtis' view?
