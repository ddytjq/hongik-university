<H1>Arnott Insurance Northern League</H1>
<H2>Founded: 1889</H2>
<P>The Northern League is the oldest surviving league after the Football
League. Traditionally the league was amongst the strongest amateur competitions
in the country and provided numerous winners and finalists of the
<A HREF="/england/amcup.html">Amateur Cup</A>. Due to their geographical
remoteness from the rest of the country the league and its members were loathe
to join the pyramid. The possibility to feed into the Alliance Premier League
and later the Northern Premier League was missed. After losing a number of long
standing ambitious clubs to other leagues within the pyramid the Northern League
finally joined the pyramid as a feeder to Division One of the NPL in 1991, two
levels below that which could have been achieved ten years before. A further
blow to the league's prestige was suffered in 1995 when the FA decided that due
to their position in the pyramid member clubs would have to play in the
<A HREF="/england/favase/">FA Vase</A> instead of the
<A HREF="/england/fatrophy/">FA Trophy</A> as they had traditionally played in.</P>
<P>Participation in the pyramid proved to be equally problematic for the
Northern League as isolation from it was. Financial and ground problems
frequently cause clubs to go out of business and consequently disbandments often
balance out promotion without it being necessary to relegate clubs. In 1993 the
Northern League were concerned that their standards were falling as clubs
promoted to the NPL were not being replaced by relegated clubs and refused to
release champions Whitby Town unless they received a relegated club in return.
Whitby were thus denied promotion. The following year Blyth Spartans were
allowed to depart in place of champions Durham City whose new ground was not
ready in time, since then neither the champions nor runners-up have met the
promotion criteria. No club has yet been relegated to the Northern League
(although Penrith were transferred from the North West Counties League in 1997)
and despite a steady stream of promoted clubs from their feeder leagues the
Northern League has yet to relegate a club.</P>
