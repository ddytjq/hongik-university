Sleep:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">During sleep, we are essentially cut off from thesensory world.  We do not hear, feel, taste, or smell, and wewould not see if our eyes were pulled open.  Everyone has differentthresholds during sleep, though; enough of any stimulus will wakeus.  How does the brain manage to cut off sensory input, yet stilllet in the really important (or insistent) stimuli?  The answerlies in the <B>thalamus</B>.  Remember, no sensory informationgets up to the cerebral cortex without first passing through thethalamus.  If the gate of the thalamus is closed, then the cortexcan shut out the world and go into sleep-mode.  <BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>B.  The EEG:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Electrophysiologists define sleep in terms of theelectrical activity of the brain.  Just like the electrical activityof the heart can be measured with electrodes on the chest, depolarizationsin the brain can be recorded at the scalp.  This technique isthe electro-encephalogram, or the <B>EEG</B>.  An EEG is an averageof all the electrical events going on in the brain, and in anawake person it would look something like this:</FONT><P><IMG SRC="sleep1.gif"><BR><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">There is no apparent pattern to the activity, andthe activity doesn't seem to be very strong.  This is due to thefact that there are so many unrelated simultaneous events goingon that many will cancel each other out, leading to a tracingwhich looks nearly flat.  This type of EEG activity is called<B>desynchronous</B>, and is <U>low amplitude but high frequency</U>. <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">During sleep, the multitude of electrical eventsbegin to fall into sync with one another, and the tracing takeson a new appearance:</FONT><P><IMG SRC="sleep2.gif"><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Notice that the fluctuations are larger and slowerthan in the awake state.  This pattern is called <B>synchronous</B>,and is <U>high amplitude but low frequency</U>.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">There are four recognized stages of sleep, from thefirst and &quot;lightest&quot; stage to the deepest fourth stage. At night, you progress from stage 1 to stage 4 in the first hourof sleep, and spend the rest of the night cycling up and downbetween 1 and 4.  The EEG gets progressively more synchronouswith each deeper stage.  Every time you return to stage 1, youenter <B>REM</B> sleep - a period of sleep characterized by <U>r</U>apid<U>e</U>ye <U>m</U>ovements.  REM sleep is also called <B>paradoxicalsleep</B>, because the body appears to be more deeply asleep thanin any other stage, but the EEG looks very much like the wakingbrain.  The desynchronous activity of the brain may be due todreaming, which also occurs during REM sleep.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>C.  The ascending reticular activatingsystem:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Early on, someone noticed that if the midbrain ofa cat was transected (at point A, below), the cat fell into acoma - their EEG became permanently synchronized.  This findingalone is not too surprising.  However, if the transection wasmade down in the medulla (at point B), the cat was only paralyzed,not comatose.  The most surprising phenomenon was that if therostral stump of the transected midbrain was electrically stimulated(blue arrow), the cat "woke up" - according to its EEG.<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="sleep3.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">From these experiments it was concluded that therewas some pathway originating in the pons or midbrain that ranforward into the cerebrum and stimulated wakefulness.  The pathwaywas thought to originate with a group of neurons in the brainstem,the <B>reticular formation</B>.  Therefore it was named the <B>ascendingreticular activating system</B>.  <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">They were close.  In fact, the ascending pathwayoriginates from a group of neurons around the fourth ventriclein the rostral pons (near midbrain).  Most of these neurons are<B>acetylcholinergic</B>, and project to the thalamus, controllingwhether the gate is open or closed.  The key is in the actionof acetylcholine.  Acetylcholine cannot, by itself, activate orshut down the neurons of the thalamus.  Instead it sensitizesthem.  By slightly depolarizing the thalamic neurons (it doesthis by closing a hyperpolarizing potassium channel), the ascendingsystem can make the thalamus more sensitive to sensory input. This situation would correspond to an awake, alert state.  Let'slook at the whole system:</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="sleep4.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The acetylcholinergic neurons project both to the<B>sensory areas of thalamus</B> (such as VPL) and to the <B>reticularnucleus</B>, a layer of cells that wraps around the thalamus likethe rind of an orange.  This "reticular" has nothingto do with the "reticular" in the brainstem!  The factthat the ascending reticular activating system targets the reticularnucleus is only maddening coincidence.  The reticular nucleusof the thalamus has a general inhibitory effect on sensory thalamus. Now, although both areas are receiving acetylcholine, they havedifferent receptors and respond in different ways.  Sensory thalamusis sensitized by acetylcholine (or "facilitated") asdescribed above, but the reticular nucleus is inhibited by acetylcholine. We can redraw the situation like this:</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="sleep5.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">So what happens when the brain is awake?  The cholinergiccells are active, so they facilitate sensory thalamus and inhibitthe reticular nucleus.  The inhibition of the reticular nucleusactually excites the sensory thalamus as well (negative x negative= positive).  As a result the thalamus lets all sensory informationthrough, and cortex is highly active and desynchronized dealingwith all the input.  </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">And when the brain is asleep?  Now the ascendingsystem is quiet, so sensory thalamus is not particularly sensitive. In addition, the reticular nucleus is freed from inhibition,so it can inhibit the sensory thalamus.  The net effect is thatthalamus is very insensitive to sensory stimuli, the gate is closed,and the cortex can rest.  An interesting property of the thalamicneurons is that when hyperpolarized, they have slow intrinsicwaves of activity, similar to the pacemaker of the heart.  Thisactivity may be the source of the slow synchronous pattern ofthe sleeping EEG.  It also may function to keep the cortex inshape, ensuring that even when you are asleep the cortical neuronsare active.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">A summary:<BR></FONT><CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><U><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">AWAKE</FONT></U></CENTER></TD><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><U><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">ASLEEP</FONT></U></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">ACh system active</FONT></CENTER></TD><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">ACh system inactive</FONT></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">sensory thalamus facilitated</FONT></CENTER></TD><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">sensory thalamus inhibited</FONT></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">reticular nucleus inhibited</FONT></CENTER></TD><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">reticular nucleus active</FONT></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">thalamocortical neurons active</FONT></CENTER></TD><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">thalamocortical neurons in slow rhythm</FONT></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">EEG desynchronous</FONT></CENTER></TD><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">EEG synchronous</FONT></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino"> </FONT></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Any student who regularly attends classes will recognizethat these two states are merely the endpoints of a single continuum.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>D.  Dreaming</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Dreaming occurs during REM sleep, the "paradoxical"sleep stage.  Curiously, the ascending acetylcholinergic systemactually turns on - it is as though the brain wakes up internally. Yet for some reason the person remains unconscious and unaware. Dreams generally do not make it to conscious memory unless thedreamer is awakened from the dream itself.  </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">How is it that the cholinergic system can be on andthe sleeper still unconscious?  The answer probably lies in otherneurotransmitters and nuclei of the rostral pons.  The <B>dorsalraphe nuclei</B>, a cluster of <B>serotonergic</B> cells, andthe <B>locus ceruleus</B>, a group of <B>noradrenergic</B> neurons,also play a role in sleep.  They may help to keep consciousnesssuppressed during dreaming.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">One of the striking things about REM sleep is theabsolute stillness of the body.  During most stages of sleep wetoss and turn, but in REM sleep only the eye muscles twitch (and,for some unknown reason, the middle ear muscles!).  This is duelargely to a system of <B>descending inhibition</B>.  Dreamingturns on a group of cells in the medulla that descend down thespinal cord and inhibit motor activity.  Very specific lesionsof these cells (a rare event) lead to a phenomenon called "violentsleeping", where the dreamer physically acts out his or herdreams.  This is different from sleepwalking, which usually does<U>not</U> occur during REM sleep.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>E.  Language</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Language, in most people, appears to be localizedalmost exclusively to the left cerebral hemisphere.  Knowing whatyou know about the organization of the brain, where would be themost logical place to put a cortical area in charge of the productionof language?  First and foremost, you need fine control over thetongue and mouth.  It would make sense to put your cortical areanear the mouth section of motor cortex.  Sure enough, just rostralto the motor-mouth area of the precentral gyrus is a small areathat controls speech.  It is called Broca's area, after the physicianwho discovered it in 1861.  Broca had a patient who, after a stroke,completely lost the ability to speak.  The patient could apparentlyunderstand language, but the only syllable he could produce was"tan", over and over again.  After Tan's death, Brocaperformed an autopsy and determined the site of the stroke.  Broca'sarea is shown below:<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="sleep6.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">What about language comprehension?  Where is themost logical place to put the comprehension area?  First you mustdecide if language is primarily visual or auditory.  When youread, do you &quot;hear&quot; the words in your head?  When youlisten, do you &quot;see&quot; the words as written? Which camefirst, written or spoken language?  You probably agree that languageis more of an auditory phenomenon than visual.  As expected, thelanguage comprehension area is just adjacent to auditory cortex,where the parietal lobe meets the temporal lobe.  This area wasdiscovered by Wernicke in 1874, by a studying patients with selectcomprehension deficits.  These patients could not understand language,spoken or written, and could apparently produce copious flowingspeech.  Their speech, however, made absolutely no sense.  Subjectsand verbs would be strung together in a seemingly grammaticalorder, like fragments of real sentences, but the sentences seemedto bear little relation to what the patient was trying to express. Presumably the patients could not understand what came out oftheir own mouths.  Wernicke's area is shown below:<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="sleep7.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">But language is far too complex to be broken downinto two discrete cortical areas.  Obviously there are visualand manual components to language, for reading and writing.  Wheredoes sign language fit in?  How do you explain a patient whoseonly deficit is an inability to name tools?  He can describe theuse of a hammer but not its name.  How does a collection of syllables- a person's name - trigger the face, personality, birthdate,or voice of that person in your memory?  Language is probablylocated all over the brain, with extensive crosstalk between areas. The discrete areas of Broca and Wernicke may be necessary forlanguage, but they are certainly not sufficient.  <BR><BR></FONT><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=#0000FF FACE="Palatino"><A HREF="http://thalamus.wustl.edu/course">RETURN TO HOME PAGE</A></FONT></B></BODY></HTML>
