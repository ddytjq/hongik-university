stand is no smoking and all seater.

in plastic glasses (which often sit half-full when the bar is quiet).
Blackburn now joins Birmingham, West Brom and Walsall by offering Chicken
Balti Pies along with the more normal choices (although after two seasons of
claiming to sell them, many fans point out there are never any available).

car park, making it no longer the best place for away fans to park
(although they do now allow some parking).
