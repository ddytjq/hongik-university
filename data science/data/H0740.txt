Much of the work John Miller does is aimed at approximating and predicting the confounding behavior of the
real world. As an associate professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University and an external SFI
faculty member, Miller applies computer modeling to such messy human behaviors as politics and voting.
Ask not what models can do for social science, Miller's work over the past decade seems to say, ask what
social science can do for computer-modeling research.
</p>
<p>
Miller likes to poke fun at orthodox social scientists who "hate to have the real world spoil a good theory."
The inevitable guffaws can't conceal a seeming contradiction embodied in Miller's arcane craft: The
techniques and approaches he employs to probe for weaknesses in simulation models themselves will be
used to help perfect those models. Miller published a paper in the June 1988 issue of Management Science in
which he demonstrated how only tiny changes in the initial assumptions of a model made it behave
strangely.
</p>
<p>
In this case, his target was World3, a well-known global-population model designed by Georgia Tech
economist Peter Brecke. The model, which incorporates approximately 150 formulas, was featured in the
1972 book The Limits to Growth and its sequel, Beyond the Limits. World3 grimly predicted that the world's
population will peak at 9.4 billion around 2040, and then collapse to 3.9 billion by 2100. The model employs
272 variables, 96 of which are set initially for such factors as global food production, and the supply of
drinking water.
</p>
<p>
Miller dissected the population model with computational tools developed at SFI. The dissection itself offers
a glimpse of how Miller and his colleagues at SFI can pinpoint weaknesses of any model.
</p>
<p>
In the case of World3, Miller unleashed ANTs (active nonlinear tests). The ANTs employed two so-called
optimization algorithms. One algorithm is a genetic algorithm or GA. It semi-randomly introduces small
mutations into the model's 96 "genes" or initial variables-two mutations at a time. The algorithm then
computes a new population. The GA also plays the role of virtual matchmaker: It "mates" promising mutant
combinations with one another and searches for even bigger population estimates.
</p>
<p>
The second ANT, called a "hill-climbing" algorithm, is intent solely on finding the biggest global population
possible. It seizes local optima as starting points for subsequent iterations of the entire process. Mutations
that result in higher global population estimates are saved, while those that generate lower population
estimates are discarded.
</p>
<p>
Miller describes his ANTs as "ready and tireless critics." They searched across sets of parameters in
World3 and detected unexpected relationships that otherwise would have gone unnoticed. His tireless critics
discovered a weakness in World3 when they simultaneously mutated two parameters: number 75, the
fraction of industrial output allocated to consumption, and number 83, the reproductive lifetime of women.
With only those two parameters perturbed, the global-population prediction soared.
</p>
<p>
The ANTs also found a set of minor perturbations that led to a global-population estimate of 29 billion
people by the year 2100 (versus 3.9 billion predicted by the original model). Such a result, so different
from the model-maker's prediction, suggests that World3 may generate big errors in some circumstances
and therefore might need refinement. "We need to have ways to break this and other models," says Miller.
"Of course, the fact that you can break a model doesn't mean that that model is bad. All models have to be
responsive to their inputs. Useful models lie in a delicate area between being too responsive to inputs and
being too unresponsive."
</p>
<p>
Miller says ANTs can't "guarantee quality modeling." But, he says, they can help refine a model that is
sensitive to initial conditions or one that includes complicated "parameter spaces." His summary of the
ANTs' success with World3 in Management Science wryly concludes, "Like ants seeking food at a picnic, a
variety of avenues are creatively explored, and it is only with extreme care and foresight that the meal
remains untouched."
</p>
<p>
Miller's use of biological metaphors is no accident. As an undergraduate at the University of Colorado and a
graduate student at the University of Michigan, he was deeply intrigued by the common historical and
theoretical roots of economics and biology. English economist and mathematician Thomas Malthus first
outlined that connection in 1798 in "An Essay on the Principle of Population As it Affects the Future
Improvement of Society."
</p>
<p>
Malthus solemnly predicted that the growing human population would inevitably overwhelm the ability of
Earth to support it. Malthus said human-population crashes are inevitable. Charles Darwin, a contemporary
of Malthus, was inspired by the broad implications of the thesis. Darwin applied the Malthusian theory to all
animal species and wrote that every reproducing species sows the seeds for its own difficulties by
overproducing offspring.
</p>
<p>
An additional premise of his theory of evolution by natural selection is that survivors of times of stress
would have advantageous traits, and those traits would become amplified over succeeding generations.
"Biology and economics started their dance back with Malthus," says Miller. "During the mid-1900s the
two fields separated for a while, but they again have become intertwined."
</p>
<p>
After Miller graduated from Michigan, he gravitated to SFI and to John Holland, an SFI Science Board
member and the inventor of genetic algorithms. Miller became SFI's first postdoctoral fellow in 1988, and,
one year later, he and Holland co-founded the Institute's Adaptive Computation Program.
</p>
<p>
Miller says one aim of his modeling work is to expose the "invisible hand." The term was coined by Adam
Smith, an 18th-century economist and author of The Wealth of Nations. Smith's metaphoric hand is the
imperceptible force that sets a price equilibrium when the quantity of a good such as corn or a common
stock equals the quantity in demand. "It is remarkable to watch a bunch of sleepy students meander about in
an experimental market and act as if there were some centralized force guiding their actions," says Miller.
"But we don't yet have a coherent explanation for how this happens."
</p>
<p>
Miller finds the invisible hand at work in many kinds of social phenomena, even in one of the most baffling
human behaviors: politics. Just as Darwin's finches evolved to prosper and survive on the Galapagos
Islands, Miller thinks a form of the invisible hand guides political parties in a democracy to win elections.
</p>
<p>
Miller and his co-authors have explained, in papers published in the American Economic Review, American
Political Science Review, and other journals and book chapters, how biologically based models can be used
to understand political systems. Miller has teamed with colleagues Ken Kollman at the University of
Michigan and Scott Page at the University of Iowa.
</p>
<p>
"What we are trying to illustrate," says Miller, "is that a very simple system, like voting, can lead to
very complicated behavior." Of course, political complications are grist for public-affairs television
programs. The programs' pundits often predict election results poorly, even though they pore over polling
data. Who would predict, for example, that 16 years after segregationist candidate George Wallace won the
1972 Democratic presidential primary in Michigan, civil rights activist Jesse Jackson would win the same
voting contest.
</p>
<p>
In Miller's model of the political world, an election fulfills the same role as a hostile environment: political
parties must adapt to their environment to survive. The traditional model of politics is naive. It assumes
that political parties are perfectly rational and perfectly calculating: They know each voter's position, they
accurately know other parties' platforms, and they simply select a platform, even one very different from
their previous platform, in order to win the most votes. One can almost hear a chortle as Miller critiques
that rosy view. "Even if political parties actually knew all that, which they don't, trying to find the best
platform is realistically impossible. Our model, instead of being super-calculating about what new platform
a party should present to voters, allows the parties to basically grope like a biological system that
mutates. The models we are setting up also allow a party to have limited information. It can make a couple
of random changes in its platform and then see if voters like that platform better than the previous one.
With this model we get much closer to the real world, where parties converge on some issues like welfare
and social security reform, and diverge on other issues like abortion."
</p>
<p><img src="images/ventura.gif" align=right border="0" hspace="4" vspace="4">
Miller's political models use artificial adaptive agents, or AAAs, which were first created by Holland,
Miller, and others in the early-1990s. With AAAs, "the unfolding behavior of the models can be observed
step-by-step," says Miller. One model developed by Kollman, Miller, and Page created virtual parties
whose only knowledge about voter preferences was polls. The parties also were not perfect optimizers, and
they were either ideologically motivated, or pragmatic in their approach to molding platforms on issues
voters care about. "Adaptive parties make good choices in our model, maybe not optimal choices, but very
good choices," says Miller. But the voters that political parties try to appeal to have a range of views that
sometimes are not reducible to a bell-shaped continuum. "With what we call centrist voters, you get a
smooth, Mt. Fuji-looking 'voting landscape' where the elevation at a political latitude and longitude tells you
how many people will vote for a platform at that position. And if you are wandering around Mt. Fuji, even in
a dense fog, you will end up on the top. But among extremist voters who care deeply about issues like
abortion, the landscape is very rugged and parties can get trapped at the top of a local peak: They may end
up on an ant pile in the fog, and not know that they are at the base of Mt. Everest."
</p>
<p>
Surprisingly, the most democratic situations sometimes alienate large minorities. In a community in which
the majority always sets public policy, large minorities can be unhappy and have no recourse. Miller calls it
a stable equilibrium with a less-than-optimal outcome. "Political parties can break the system out of a bad
outcome and allow it to go to a better one," he says. With such equilibria, an injection of "noise" is needed
to break the less-than-optimal equilibrium.
</p>
<p>
Minnesota's new governor, Jesse "The Body" Ventura, a former professional wrestler, could be considered
such noise. "The overall effect of Jesse's election as governor may be to break Minnesota out of a bad
equilibrium," says Miller. "So the key idea here is something called Ôsimulated annealing.'"
</p>
<p><img src="images/jesse.gif" alt="Jesse Ventura, photo by Walter Iooss Jr. , Sports Illustrated" align=right border="0" hspace="4" vspace="4">
Simulated annealing is a term derived from metal working. In order to make a very strong metal by lining
up its atoms, metal workers heat the substance to near its melting point and cool it very slowly, and repeat
the process several times. Episodes of political "noise" can accomplish something similar. "You want to put
noise into the system when it is in a bad configuration, but you don't want to put noise into it when it is in a
good configuration," says Miller. "A clever thing about political institutions is they naturally do that: the
more people who are happy, the less likely that change is going to occur."
</p>
<p>
Few disgruntled voters might use "clever" and "political institutions" in the same sentence. However,
voter and consumer preferences and tastes can shift as quickly as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and
Miller's modeling techniques may one day provide a more evolved way to generate the rarest of
commodities: foresight.

With a majority of red chile lovers in each town, the system is stable. Each town
votes in red chile for everyone, and no one wants to change towns. Note that
although this configuration is stable, all the green chile lovers must eat red
chile (a tragedy according to Miller).
</p>

<p>
Suppose that one day they run out of red chile in town B and must pick and serve
green chile. News of this development spreads fast, and we immediately see the
townsfolk move to accommodate their culinary desires, the result of which is
shown below.
</p>

<br><br>
Notice that after these relocations, the towns are again in a stable
configuration. When elections are held, everyone in town A votes for red chile
and everyone in town B votes for green. Also, note that no one wants to relocate.
Finally, and most importantly, notice that everyone is happier in this new
arrangement--all the red chile lovers dine on red chile and all the green chile
lovers feast on green. The random running out of red chile in town B (a little
instability) has allowed the system to move to a better configuration.
