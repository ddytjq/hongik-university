<td><font face="Times"><b>The "New and Improved" Spectrum of Primordial Sound</b>. The temperature variations in early universe seen in the BOOMERANG images are due to sound
waves in the primordial plasma. The angular spectrum of these images shown
here, reveals the characteristic size of the structures that dominate the
image. A peak in this spectrum at scales of ~ 1 degree, as is seen here
in the BOOMERANG data, indicates that the Universe is nearly spatially
flat.  This graph is a "double-binned" plot.  The red points are independent of each other, as are the blue points.  However, each red point is based on some of the same data as its blue neighbors, and vice versa.  Therefore neighboring points are correlated.

<td><font face="Times"><b>Cosmological parameter estimation from BOOMERANG</b>.  The power spectrum of primordial sound waves can be used to estimate various parameters of the Universe.  Some of these parameters include how fast the Universe is expanding, the age of the Universe, the total mass of the Universe, and how much of that mass is comprised of normal (baryonic) matter.  The spectrum at left shows the data points (in black) that were used for the analysis, as well as several different models that have good fits to the data.
