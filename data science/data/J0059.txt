            Calif. (October 7, 2000) Jeff Parr, a Boris Said fan
            and Mailman, from Santa Rosa CA was declared the
            winner of the Semi-Final Match against Said and
            advanced to the final round in Saturday's
            Racephotos.com and Pockets Billiards pool tournament
            to benefit the Greater Bay Area Make-A-Wish
            Foundation. The billiards tournament was part of a
            charity fund-raiser and featured Race Fans competing
            against Racers.<br>
            <br>
            In a Semi-Final Match, Boris Said, faced with one
            Stripe, one Solid, and the eight ball on the table,
            set his sites on eliminating &quot;The Mailman&quot;
            and advancing to the Championship match. As the only
            racer remaining in the tournament, Said was in
            control and 2 shots away from a victory. The next
            shot was in, leaving the game winning shot at the
            eight ball. With his signature No Fear style, Said
            picked his line across the table to the furthest
            corner and let it rip. The intensity grew as the cue
            ball contacted the eight ball center table and sent
            it off directly toward the targeted pocket.
            &quot;It's in!!, It's in!!,&quot; Shouted John
            Fosgate, the Tournament Announcer. &quot;Boris Said
            advances to the Championship match.&quot; The crowd
            erupted as Boris celebrated his winning shot.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4"
            face="Times New Roman"><br>
            But not so fast, The cue ball was still moving and on
            a steady roll toward the adjacent corner pocket. The
            crowd's cheers turned to gasps, as the inevitable was
            about to take place. Said was pumping his foot on the
            floor as if to apply the brakes to the rolling cue
            ball. The ball reached the pocket, hung over the edge
            for a split second and then fell in. &quot;Oh No!
            Ladies and Gentleman, Boris Said has scratched on the
            eight ball,&quot; proclaimed Fosgate.<br>
            <br>
            Alex Khanbabian, Owner of Pockets Billiards,
            confirmed House Rules and ruled the scratch on the
            eight ball a disqualifying shot, officially declaring
            Parr the winner.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;I can't believe it,&quot;said Said, laughing
            &quot;It's just like Sears Point this year, all over
            again.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Parr met Mickey Suen, an avid billiards player and
            Business Development Manager in Silicon Valley, in
            the Championship Match. Suen defeated Parr to claim
            the First Annual RacePhotos.com and Pockets Billiards
            Championship Title.</font></p>

            The Tournament Champ was presented with two Three Day
            Paddock Passes to this weekend's Global Center Sports
            Car Championships, Presented by Honda, at Laguna Seca
            Raceway as part of the winning prize package. The
            victory celebration took place in the Pockets
            Billiards winners circle where Suen was photographed
            with all Racers participating in the event by Chucke
            Walkden. Walkden is the Official Photographer of
            Sears Point Raceway and a Laguna Seca Raceway
            Photographer. Walkden will present Suen with a
            26&quot; X 36&quot; framed photo of his winners
            circle celebration autographed by each of the racers.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;I read about the event in the San Francisco
            Chronicle and came down here hoping to get a chance
            to play against the racers,&quot; Suen Said.
            &quot;It's great that they take time out of their
            busy schedules to support a great cause like the
            Make-A-Wish Foundation.&quot;</font></p>

            &quot;I've been watching Boris Said race for years.
            That guy can drive anything,&quot; said Parr.
            &quot;When I heard he was going to be in Mountain
            View playing in a billiards tournament with fans, I
            thought it would be really cool if I got the chance
            to play against him and I did. I just hope it's him
            on the top of the podium this coming Sunday.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            &quot;I was really happy with the balance of my # 19
            cue,&quot; said Said, with a smile. &quot;Everything
            was going according to plan until that incident with
            the #8 in the corner. I really wanted to win this
            thing, but more importantly I'm glad I was able to
            contribute to a cause that helps children who are
            less fortunate than ourselves.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Other Racers taking part in the event included Izzy
            Sanchez (SCCA Champion), James Randolph (AMA
            Motorcycle Star), Oliver Rowen (#1 Driver for the
            Track Magic Shifter Kart Team) <br>
            <br>
            The winner of the Grand Prize from the benefit
            drawing selected from over 60 photographs in
            Walkden's displayed collection. The display included
            pieces from ALMS, NASCAR, CART, NHRA Drag Racing, AMA
            Motorcycles, Offshore powerboats, World of Outlaws,
            and more. Joel Albrecht of Hayward CA had the lucky
            ticket and chose a shot of the Futuristic Visteon
            Panoz LMP-1 Roadster from the American Le Mans Series
            Prototype Class. <br>
            <br>
            &quot;Give me a minute, I'm overwhelmed,&quot;
            Albrecht said when he learned of his fortune.<br>
