A graphical method is presented
for displaying the patterns in a set of aligned sequences.
The characters representing the sequence are stacked on top
of each other for each position in the aligned sequences.
The height of
each letter is made proportional to its frequency, and the letters are sorted
so the most common one is on top.
The height of the entire stack is then
adjusted to signify the information content of the sequences at that position.
From these `sequence logos', one can determine
not only the consensus sequence
but also the relative frequency of bases and
the information content (measured in bits) at every position in a
site or sequence.
The logo displays
both significant residues and
subtle sequence patterns.

INTRODUCTION
A logo is ``a single piece of type bearing two or more usually separate

elements'' [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Soukhanov1984">1</A>].  In this paper, we use logos
to display aligned sets of sequences.  Sequence logos
concentrate the following information into a single graphic [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Tufte1983">2</A>]:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>The general consensus of the sequences.
<DT>2.
<DD>The order of predominance of the residues at every position.
<DT>3.
<DD>The relative frequencies of every residue at every position.
<DT>4.
<DD>The amount of information present at every position in the sequence,
measured in bits.
<DT>5.
<DD>An initiation point, cut point, or other significant location (if appropriate).
</DL>Any aligned set of DNA, RNA or protein sequences can be represented using this
technique.

<P>
CREATION OF BINDING SITE LOGOS
To create a logo from a set of sequences,

the sequences are first
aligned relative to one another.
For example, a set of ribosome binding sequences can
be aligned at the translational initiation point [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Gold1981">3</A>].
A table of frequencies of each base at each
position is then constructed.
The
frequency table is examined at each individual position and sorted by the
frequency of bases.  The most frequent base, called the ``consensus'' base,
appears on the top of the final graphic
and is commonly used to represent the pattern
of a sequence
[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Reznikoff1986">4</A>].
However, a consensus sequence does not represent all the
information in the sequences since in many cases other bases also appear at
a significant frequency.
For example, the procaryotic initiation codon, which
is predominantly AUG, also has GUG and UUG on occasion.
If one ignores these
possibilities, one has distorted the data.  This is one of several reasons why
the consensus sequence is a poor model for binding sites
[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Sadler1983">5</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#Stormo1990">6</A>].

<P>
The importance of a particular position in a binding site is more clearly and
consistently given by the information required to describe the pattern there
[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Shannon1948">7</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#Pierce1980">8</A>].  To choose one symbol or state from two
equally likely
possibilities requires one ``bit'' of information.  For example, to communicate
the result of a coin-flip to someone requires 1 bit of information
because only one yes-no
question needs to be answered: ``Is it heads?''.  If a position in a binding
site always contains one base
(<EM>e.g.</EM>  G),
then we need exactly two bits of information since two yes-no
questions need to be answered: ``Is it A or G?''
(<EM>i.e.</EM> is it a purine?) and ``Is it A or C?''.  (If
the answers to both questions are ``no'', it must be a T.)
Furthermore, if a position contains two bases
(<EM>e.g.</EM> sometimes A and sometimes G),
only one question suffices since a two out of four
choice is equivalent to a one out of two choice.  Therefore,
only one bit is needed
to describe a position in a binding site that contains only purines, but two
bits are needed to describe a position that always contains adenine.

<P>
If the frequencies of bases are not exactly equi-probable, then a more
sophisticated calculation is needed to find the average information
at a position.
In 1948, Claude Shannon showed how to do this
[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Shannon1948">7</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#Pierce1980">8</A>].  Following Shannon,
we define the uncertainty measure as:

determined by multiplying the frequency of that base by

The bases are then stacked on top of each other in increasing order of their
frequencies and plotted.
Vertical bars serve both as junction markers
and as size markers.

<P>
The logos as we have described them do not account for the spacing
between parts of a binding site, as with ribosome binding sites
(Shine and Dalgarno to initiation codon) or
procaryotic promoters (-35 to -10).
When a binding site has two parts,
it is possible to align
both portions and create a logo for each.
The spacing could be indicated by a histogram that shows
the frequency distribution of the spacing.
Alternatively, a logo could be created for each spacing.
Since variable spacing reduces the overall information content of a pattern,
the length of a downward pointing arrow could
be used to indicate the amount of pattern reduction.
(See the discussion of this issue in [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Schneider1986">9</A>].)

<P>
In cases where there are few sequences, a meaningful logo cannot be made.
One sequence does not tell anything about the pattern that
is recognized and the sampling correction will force the logo to be
completely flat [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Schneider1986">9</A>].
However, an experimental technique has been devised
which can be used to determine the frequency table
<I>f</I>(<I>b</I>, <I>l</I>) from synthetically created binding sites
[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Schneider1989">12</A>],
and this can be used to create the logo
(Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.T7">3</A>).

In the case of protein sequences, we use the formulation

since the highest possible uncertainty is from 20 equi-probable amino acids.

<P>
Gaps are introduced into protein sequences when they are aligned
[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Hein1990">13</A>].
To avoid confusion with the small sample size problem discussed above,
suppose that we had an alignment of 10<SUP>6</SUP> sequences, and that
at one position 90% had a gap inserted and the remaining 10% had a P.
Such a position would appear in the logo as strongly conserved,
even though it exists in only a small fraction of the sequences.
To avoid being fooled by such cases, they are suppressed
by adjusting the height of the stack of letters by the proportion of the
data available.  Thus the P would be reduced to 10% of its unsuppressed height.

<P>
Logos were created using the Pascal
[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Jensen1975">14</A>]
programs of the Delila system
[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Schneider1982">15</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#Schneider1984">16</A>].
All programs described here are available on various media,
including
magnetic tape,
floppy disk,
electronic mail (contact: toms@ncifcrf.gov)
and
internet file transfer protocol (ftp ncifcrf.gov, password:
anonymous, in directory pub/delila).
Information curves for DNA and RNA sequences were calculated by the
Rseq and Sites programs according to the methods given in
[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Schneider1986">9</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#Schneider1988">10</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#Schneider1989">12</A>]
and converted to a useable format
using a program called Dalvec.
Information curves for aligned protein sequences were calculated
by a program called Alpro.
The MakeLogo program sorts the
bases or amino acids given by Dalvec or Alpro
by their frequency
and produces the logo in the graphics language

Each character in the logo can be assigned a color, and can be drawn
filled-in or as an outline.
The vertical sizes of
C, G and the bar (<code>|</code>) characters
were adjusted to match the sizes of A and T
since C, G and <code>|</code>
extend above and below
A and T in the Helvetica-Bold font we used.
To allow for proteins and other sequences,
O, Q, S, J and U were also adjusted.
Outline fonts were clipped so that they would stay
within the bounds of these adjusted sizes.

INTERPRETATION OF BINDING SITE LOGOS
Logos contain several different types of information.  First, at each position
the bases are arranged in order of predominance from top to bottom, with the
highest-frequency base being on top of the stack.  The general consensus can be
found by reading the top base at every position.  In addition, the relative
size of the individual bases shows the relative frequency of the four bases at
a position.  If a letter is large compared to the other letters in a
column, then its frequency at that position is high.  Conversely, letters
that are small when compared to the others in their column have low
frequencies.  Relative letter sizes probably only have meaning in the column
they reside in, although we note the curious consistency in height of the
pyrimidines below the Shine and Dalgarno purines [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Shine1974">19</A>]
in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.ribosome">1</A>.   
A similar effect is observed for the purines below the pyrimidine
tract at the 3' ends of introns (in preparation).

<P>
The height of the entire stack is proportional to the information at that
position in the binding site.
The most important positions
are easily spotted,
yet subtle patterns can also be observed.
For example, the reduction in the height of the
first base of the initiation codon
in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.ribosome">1</A> reflects the presence of the alternative bases
that appear below the A.

<P>
The logo in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.lambda.cI_cro">2</A>   
shows the <EM>cI</EM> and <EM>cro</EM> binding
sites in bacteriophage <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.gif"
 ALT="$\lambda$">.
It demonstrates that (for unknown reasons)
the bases in the binding site have alternatively varying importance.
To create this logo, both the sequences and their complements were used,
so the resulting logo shows dyad symmetry about the central base.

<P>
In comparison to the other binding sites, the pattern at
T7 promoters in the phage genome is dense
(Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.T7">3</A>, upper logo)   
and contains more information than one would expect [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Schneider1986">9</A>].
However, when an experiment is performed to determine what
components are important to the RNA polymerase [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Schneider1989">12</A>],
only half of the pattern remains
(Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.T7">3</A>, lower logo).
The excess pattern is thought to represent the binding site of
another DNA binding protein [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Schneider1986">9</A>].
The logos clearly show the difference between the pattern present
in the phage genome and the pattern required by the T7 RNA polymerase alone.

<P>
Finally, logos can be used to display aligned protein sequences,
as illustrated in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.globin">4</A>.   
The conservation of several internal hydrophobic
amino acids [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Bashford1987">20</A>]
can easily be seen in this protein logo.
