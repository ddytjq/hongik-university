AB: Bilateral periventricular nodular heterotopia (BPNH) is a recently
recognized malformation of neuronal migration, and perhaps proliferation, in
which nodular masses of gray matter line the walls of the lateral ventricles.
Most affected individuals have epilepsy and normal intelligence with no other
congenital anomalies. A striking skew of the sex ratio has been observed
because 31 of 38 probands have been female, and one gene associated with BPNH
was recently mapped to chromosome Xq28. We report three unrelated boys with a
new multiple congenital anomaly-mental retardation syndrome that consists of
BPNH, cerebellar hypoplasia, severe mental retardation, epilepsy, and
syndactyly. Variable abnormalities included focal or regional cortical
dysplasia, cataracts, and hypospadius. We hypothesize that this syndrome
involves the same Xq28 locus as isolated BPNH, and we review the expanding
number of syndromes associated with BPNH.<p>

AB: Bilateral periventricular nodular heterotopia (BPNH) is a malformation of
neuronal migration and is characterized by nodules of heterotopic gray matter
lining the lateral ventricles of the brain. The majority of BPNH patients are
female and have epilepsy as a sole clinical manifestation of their disease.
Familial BPNH has been mapped to Xq28 by linkage analysis. A multiple
congenital anomaly-mental retardation syndrome (BPNH/MR) was recently
delineated in three unrelated boys with BPNH, cerebellar hypoplasia, severe
mental retardation, epilepsy, and syndactyly. High-resolution chromosome
analysis revealed a subtle abnormality of Xq28 in one of the boys with BPNH/MR
syndrome. FISH with cosmids and YACs from Xq28 further characterized this
abnormality as a 2.25-3.25-Mb inverted duplication. No abnormality of Xq28 was
detected by G-banding or FISH in the other two boys. These data support the
linkage assignment of BPNH to band Xq28 and narrow the critical region to the
distal 2.25-3.25 Mb of Xq28.<p>

AB: This report describes beta-amyloid plaques in periventricular heterotopias
in two elderly women. The neuropathologic features of the heterotopias
recapitulated those of nearby neocortex but were distinct from those of
adjacent caudate nucleus. In response to the factors important in plaque and
tangle formation, the heterotopias biologically behave like neocortex and
unlike adjacent striatum, further supporting the morphologic evidence that
these tissues represent heterotopic cortex.<p>

AB: A systematic approach needs to be used to review MR scans in epilepsy
patients to avoid the common pitfalls engendered by the subtle nature of many
epileptogenic lesions. One should always evaluate the hippocampus regardless of
other MR findings to avoid missing dual abnormalities. False-positive and
false-negative diagnosis of hippocampal sclerosis can be avoided by evaluating
the hippocampus after correcting for head rotation [by assessing the internal
auditory canals and atria). Periventricular heterotopia can be successfully
diagnosed by systematically studying the periventricular regions, especially
those adjacent to the atria of the lateral ventricles. Gray matter lateral to
the ventricles (excluding the caudate nucleus) is always an abnormal finding.
Sulcal and cortical morphologic abnormalities are particularly difficult to
diagnose unless a high index of suspicion is maintained. Cortical thickening is
indicative of a developmental anomaly and should be screened in an organized
manner. Because epilepsy is generally a cortical process, one must search for
subtle cortical abnormalities, including focal atrophic abnormalities and
lesions without mass effect. Diligence will offer its own rewards.<p>

AB: We report an autopsy case of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in a 20-week
gestational age female fetus. The brain showed lesions suggestive of early
cortical tubers and subependymal hamartomatous nodules. The large cells within
these nodular clusters were variably immunoreactive for glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP) and vimentin and negative for synaptophysin and neurofilament.
Subependymal radial glia expressed both vimentin and GFAP, but subpial radial
glia either did not express these markers (in contrast to an age-matched
control) or were absent. Tuberin expression was noted in heterotopic neurons in
the white matter and brain cells consistent with Cajal Retzius cells in the
neocortical molecular layer, very weakly in superficial cortical neurons,
neurons in the basal ganglia, Purkinje cells and external granular cells of
cerebellum, cranial nerve nuclei neurons, occasional germinal matrix cells,
ependymal cells, choroid plexus epithelium, and pituitary gland neuroendocrine
cells; it was not seen within the cells of subependymal nodules. The pattern of
tuberin immunoreactivity was similar to that which we have observed in older
TSC patients. Proliferating cell labeling indexes were comparable in the
germinal matrix of the TSC patient and an age-matched control. Abnormal subpial
radial glia may be responsible for some of the neuronal migration abnormalities
that appear to result in neocortical tubers.<p>

AB: Rats showing disrupted taste aversion due to insular cortex lesions,
received either homotopic or heterotopic (occipital) cortical fetal brain
grafts. Behavioral results showed that the recovery of the ability to acquire
conditioned taste aversions induced by fetal grafts depended on post-graft time
(45 but not at 15 days) and tissue specificity (homotopic but not heterotopic).
In vivo analysis of acetylcholine (ACh) release revealed that only the group
receiving homotopic grafts and tested 45 days post graft had a release of ACh
after KCl stimulation similar to that in the control group. Furthermore,
homotopic grafts and lesioned groups showed significantly weaker specific
receptor binding of [3H]L-glutamate compared with controls. These results
suggest that ACh is specifically involved in the process of behavioral recovery
induced by homotopic cortical transplants.<p>

AB: We previously demonstrated that inhibition of inducible nitric oxide (NO)
synthase (iNOS) ameliorated acute cardiac allograft rejection. This study used
a rat cardiac transplant model to characterize contractile and
electrophysiological dysfunction during early acute rejection, further examine
the role of NO and iNOS in this process, and determine which cells expressed
iNOS during early rejection. During early acute rejection, before significant
myocyte necrosis, allograft papillary muscles had reduced tension development
and rates of tension development and decline during beta-adrenergic, adenylate
cyclase, and calcium stimulation compared with isograft and normals [e.g.,
tension of 36 (allograft) vs. 73 (isograft) mN/mm2 during calcium stimulation,
P &lt; 0.001]. Allografts had resting membrane potential depolarization and
reduced action potential amplitude and upstroke velocity. iNOS mRNA was
expressed in infiltrating inflammatory cells but not in allograft myocytes,
endothelial cells, or isografts. Corticosteroids attenuated allograft
contractile and electrophysiological dysfunction and inhibited iNOS enzyme
activity. Direct iNOS inhibition with aminoguanidine inhibited NO production
and prevented allograft contractile and electrophysiological dysfunction (e.g.,
tension of 64 mN/mm2 during calcium stimulation, P &lt; 0.001). We conclude
that 1) early allograft rejection caused contractile and electrophysiological
dysfunction that was largely mediated by iNOS expression in infiltrating
inflammatory cells, 2) corticosteroid-mediated amelioration of allograft
contractile and electrophysiological dysfunction may reflect inhibition of
iNOS, and 3) iNOS inhibition may offer an alternative in management of
immune-mediated myocardial dysfunction.<p>

AB: The heart transplants with domino technique, which uses donor hearts from
heart-lung recipients, increases the pool of donors, provides the advantage of
shortening the ischemic time and makes suitable hearts for patients with
pulmonary hypertension. The present study aimed to characterise the pre- and
post-transplant clinical and hemodynamic profiles of patients that underwent
domino transplant in Pavia. METHODS: Between 1991 and 1992, 9 heart transplants
were performed with the domino procedure at I.R.C.C.S. Policlinico S. Matteo of
Pavia. Domino donors (6 with primary pulmonary hypertension, 2 with
Eisenmenger's syndrome due to atrial septal defect, 1 with cystic fibrosis)
underwent electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, chest roentgenogram studies,
and right heart catheterization and coronary angiography (for donor older than
40). Domino recipients, 6 males and 3 females with a mean age of 44 years, had
dilated cardiomyopathy (4 cases), coronary artery disease (4 cases) and
valvular heart disease (1 case) (group 1). Seven of the 9 cases entered the
study; 2 were excluded: one because had undergone heterotopic transplantation,
the other had received the heart from another country and therefore the graft
had suffered from a very long ischemic time. Controls group consisted of 12
patients who had consecutively undergone cardiac transplantation with
non-domino donors during the same period (group 2). Immunosuppression was
similar in both groups, and consisted of a combination of cyclosporin A,
azathioprine and corticosteroids, plus a 7-day-course of antithymocyte
globulin. Hemodynamic and echocardiographic controls were performed at 2, 3 and
4 weeks (short-term control) and at 2 and 6 months (mid-term control) after
surgery. RESULTS: Domino donors (39 +/- 12.5 years) had significantly higher
mean right ventricular end-diastolic diameter and lower left ventricular
diameter than normal mean values. Domino recipients had significantly higher
mean pulmonary arteriolar resistances than controls; mean ischemic time was
also significantly lower in group 1 than in group 2. Short- and mid-term
controls after surgery in group 1 showed persistently higher systemic vascular
resistances and pulmonary vascular resistances and lower cardiac output than in
group 1. Two patients developed an early and unexpected increase in pulmonary
wedge pressure accompanied by severe paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and mitral
regurgitation. In all cases, the left ventricles were relatively inadequate;
the combination of low cardiac output and of high systemic vascular resistances
favoured the occurrence of an afterload mismatch condition that was worsened by
chronic hypoxia. This condition must be known and expected in these patients
after transplantation in order to provide timely and effective treatment to
potentially life-threatening left ventricular failure episodes. IN CONCLUSION,
the subset of transplanted patients that receives domino donors may develop
left-side afterload mismatch which, combined with low cardiac output, with high
systemic vascular resistances and with the effects of chronic hypoxia
originally suffered by the heart, may cause sudden and unexpected left-side
heart failure which has to be timely recognised and managed. Although
hemodynamic adaptation of this patients is highly problematic, it does not
limit the value of the domino procedure.<p>

AB: The purpose of this study was to determine the best method to
ultrasonographically monitor renal size changes associated with acute allograft
rejection in dogs. Qualitative changes in renal cortical and medullary
echogenicity were also evaluated, although this was not a major focus of the
study. Four unrelated, mixed-breed dogs underwent bilateral nephrectomies and
heterotopic renal allograft transplantation. Ultrasound examinations of
transplanted kidneys were initiated at 3 days after surgery and continued at
2-3 day intervals until death (38 +/- 2 days). Ultrasound measurements of
kidney length, width, height, cross-sectional area, and estimated volume were
used to assess relative changes in renal size associated with transplantation
and rejection. Transplanted kidneys had a rapid increase in volume and
cross-sectional area that averaged 103% and 83% above baseline levels,
respectively, by 17 days after transplantation. The increased size was
attributed to a combination of hypertrophy and acute rejection, the latter of
which was confirmed at postmortem. Kidney volume decreased to approximately 35%
above baseline volume by day 34 as rejection became more advanced. Qualitative
changes associated with rejection included medullary enlargement with decreased
echogenicity early in the study, followed by increased cortical thickness and
echogenicity with poor cortical medullary definition in the latter stages of
the survival period. It was concluded that relative changes in renal allograft
size can be easily monitored with ultrasound. In regard to linear measurements,
changes in renal width were more pronounced than changes in height or length
with acute rejection. Therefore measurements that incorporate the width, namely
volume or cross-sectional area, appear to be the most sensitive for monitoring
changes in allograft size. Renal cross-sectional area measurements are
preferred because they are simple to perform using the automated calculation
capability of most newer ultrasound units.<p>

AB: Early recognition and adequate therapy of necrosis of the head of the femur
in adult patients in increasingly gaining importance since they considerably
influence the permanent loss of function and reduction of the earning capacity
of people of working age. Presently, MRT examination is the most conclusive
method for the early stage of necrosis of the head of the femur. After the
introduction of microsurgical methods, new therapeutic measures for avascular
necrosis of the head of the femur are available, apart from conventional
surgical methods to relieve the necrotic areas and the so-called metabolic
irritation drilling. Direct vascular-supply, autologous, heterotopic,
corticospongiose transplants in the necrotic head of the femur are suited to
re-establish circulation in the necrotic area. This involves a considerable
operative scope of work.<p>

AB: In the Department of Traumatology at the University of Ulm, 26 elderly
patients with displaced acetabular fractures were treated with primary
implantation of a hip joint endoprosthesis between 1986 and 1996. The
principles of operative therapy are stabilization of the acetabular ring,
grafting of acetabular defects with autogenous corticocancellous bone and
cranial buttressing with a reinforcing ring. This concept permits immediate
mobilization of elderly patients and full weight-bearing and thus results in
favorable early postoperative results. Secondary complications typically caused
by immobilization can therefore be avoided.<p>

AB: Malformations of the human neocortex are commonly associated with
developmental delays, mental retardation, and epilepsy. This study describes a
novel neurologically mutant rat exhibiting a forebrain anomaly resembling the
human neuronal migration disorder of double cortex. This mutant displays a
telencephalic internal structural heterotopia (tish) that is inherited in an
autosomal recessive manner. The bilateral heterotopia is prominent below the
frontal and parietal neocortices but is rarely observed in temporal neocortex.
Neurons in the heterotopia exhibit neocortical-like morphologies and send
typical projections to subcortical sites; however, characteristic lamination
and radial orientation are disturbed in the heterotopia. The period of
neurogenesis during which cells in the heterotopia are generated is the same as
in the normotopic neocortex; however, the cells in the heterotopia exhibit a
"rim-to-core" neurogenetic pattern rather than the characteristic "inside-out"
pattern observed in normotopic neocortex. Similar to the human syndrome of
double cortex, some of the animals with the tish phenotype exhibit spontaneous
recurrent electrographic and behavioral seizures. The tish rat is a unique
neurological mutant that shares several features with a human cortical
malformation associated with epilepsy. On the basis of its regional
connectivity, histological composition, and period of neurogenesis, the
heterotopic region in the tish rat is neocortical in nature. This neurological
mutant represents a novel model system for investigating mechanisms of aberrant
neocortical development and is likely to provide insights into the cellular and
molecular events contributing to seizure development in dysplastic neocortex.<p>

AB: Cortical dysplasias (CD) are characterized histologically by disorganized
cortical lamination and abnormally shaped neurons. We hypothesized that neurons
within CD have failed to differentiate fully and may express proteins such as
cytoskeletal elements characteristic of immature cells. Disrupted expression of
certain cytoskeletal proteins, which have been implicated in neuronal polarity,
process outgrowth, and migration, could result in disorganized cortical
lamination. Thus, we probed two CD subtypes, focal CD (FCD) and
hemimegalencephaly (HME), with antibodies specific for cytoskeletal proteins
that are developmentally regulated in neural progenitor cells and neurons to
define more fully the developmental phenotype of neurons within CD.
Microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) and the intermediate filament (IF)
protein nestin are enriched in neural progenitors, whereas MAP2B,
phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of medium (NFM) and high (NFH)
molecular weight neurofilament (NF) proteins, as well as the light NF subunit
(NFL) and IF protein alpha internexin are expressed in developing and mature
neurons. Immunolabeling for internexin and MAP1B was more abundant in the most
abnormally shaped neurons that populated dysplastic regions than in adjacent
regions exhibiting milder cytoarchitectural abnormalities or control cortex.
Nestin immunoreactivity was noted in large dysplastic and heterotopic neurons
within the deeper cortical layers of CD specimens but not in normal cortex. In
contrast, neurons in CD specimens also expressed cytoskeletal markers
characteristic of differentiated neurons such as NF subunits and MAP2B. These
findings suggest that the cytoarchitectural abnormalities in CD may reflect
pathophysiological changes in the developing brain that disrupt expression of
several key components of the neuronal cytoskeleton and may contribute to
impaired migration of cortical neurons.<p>

AB: The present study has been designed to investigate whether intrastriatal
implantation of mesencephalic dopamine (DA)-synthetizing neurons into the
striatum (ST) of rats whose substantia nigra (SN) was previously destroyed by
6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) restores the pattern of corticostriatal transmission
from the medial prelimbic and sensorimotor cortices. In 6-month-old normal
animals electrical stimulation of these two functionally unrelated cortices
evoked a short latency and brief excitation in 81.6% of neurons recorded in the
dorsolateral ST. This percentage decreased significantly (70.6%) in age-matched
animals whose dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway was unilaterally destroyed by
6-OHDA 3 months before recording. However a significant increase in neurons
(36.9%) which could be simultaneously activated from the two cortices in
comparison to intact rats was noted. In addition the lesion caused a
significant decrease in the threshold current required to evoke activation of
striatal neurons from the sensorimotor cortex. The increase in the number of
striatal neurons responding simultaneously to cortical stimulations
demonstrates that destruction of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway causes
a loss of the focusing action of DA on corticostriatal transmission.
Transplantation of embryonic mesencephalic neurons appears to reestablish this
action since the number of convergent responses was significantly decreased in
grafted animals (23.5%) in comparison to denervated (36.9%) and sham-grafted
(35.1%) animals. Furthermore, the grafts showed a trend to increase current
intensities required to evoke activation of striatal cells from both cortices.
The action of grafted mesencephalic neurons over prelimbic and sensorimotor
cortical inputs to the dorsal ST could be involved in recovery of grafted
animals in the correct execution of complex sensorimotor tasks requiring
integration of different cortical signals within the ST.<p>

AB: Cerebral dysgenesis is a subject of interest because of its relationship to
cerebral development and dysfunction and to epilepsy. The authors present a
detailed study of a 16-year-old boy who underwent surgery for a severe seizure
disorder. This patient had dysgenesis of the right hemisphere, which was
composed of a giant central frontoparietal nodular gray matter heterotopia with
overlying large islands of cortical dysplasia around a displaced central
fissure. Exceptional insight into the function, biochemistry,
electrophysiology, and histological structure of this lesion was obtained from
neurological studies that revealed complementary information: magnetic
resonance (MR) imaging, [18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission
tomography (PET), functional PET scanning, proton MR spectroscopic (1H-MRS)
imaging, intraoperative cortical mapping and electrocorticography, in vitro
electrophysiology, and immunocytochemistry. These studies demonstrated
compensatory cortical reorganization and showed that large areas of heterotopia
and cortical dysplasia in the central area may retain normal motor and sensory
function despite strikingly altered cytoarchitectonic organization and neuronal
metabolism. Such lesions necessitate appropriate functional imaging studies
prior to surgery and cortical mapping to avoid creating neurological deficits.
Integrated studies, such as PET, 1H-MRS imaging, cortical mapping,
immunocytochemistry, and electrophysiology may provide information on the
function of developmental disorders of cerebral organization.<p>

AB: We describe 5 women and 5 men with periventricular nodular heterotopia and
electroclinical features suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy, who were
surgically treated for control of medically refractory seizures. Magnetic
resonance imaging revealed bilateral periventricular nodular heterotopia in 7
of the 10 patients. Because of the lack of clear localization, 6 patients were
studied with intracranial depth electrode recordings. Seizures were of
hippocampal onset (3 patients), regional temporal lobe onset (2 patients), or
occipital-temporal onset (1 patient). Anterior temporal lobectomy was performed
in 6 patients; selective amygdalohippocampectomy, in 1; and anterior temporal
lobectomy plus resection of the heterotopic tissue, in 3. None of the 9
patients followed for more than 12 months postoperatively were seizure free.
Two patients were initially seizure free for approximately 18 months, but then
seizures recurred. One patient had a major reduction in seizure frequency at a
39-month follow-up after most of the unilateral heterotopic tissue was included
in the temporal resection. Temporal resection did not lead to a long-term
favorable outcome in this group of patients with periventricular nodular
heterotopia and epileptogenic discharges involving the temporal lobe. This
suggests a more widespread disorder with epileptogenic activity possibly
originating in or near the heterotopic tissue. The clinical and electrographic
features of periventricular nodular heterotopia pointing to temporal lobe
origin are misleading and temporal resection does not result in long-term
cessation of seizures.<p>

AB: Type II lissencephaly is a complex cortical malformation in which
mesenchymal and central nervous components are intermingled. It is generally
believed that the histological pattern is created by migration of heterotopic
neuroblasts into the leptomeninges through defects in the superficial basement
membrane. Defects of the extracellular matrix have been suggested to be the
primary cause of type II lissencephaly. To elucidate the underlying
pathogenetic mechanisms, we immunostained extracellular matrix and basement
membrane components of the cerebral cortex from six fetal and two infantile
brains. We found that the pattern of collagen subtypes I, III and VI was not
altered in type II lissencephaly brains when compared to normal controls. As to
the pathogenesis of type II lissencephaly, a polymicrogyria-like pattern is
created, which results in considerable cortical enlargement. The microgyri do
not fuse but remain separated from each other by gliovascular tissue, i.e.,
leptomeninges which contain astrocytes. At the interface between the enlarged
brain surface and the gliovascular tissue, neuronal migration takes place
through gaps in the external basement membrane. Thus, the cortical dysplasia
encountered in type II lissencephaly is only due to a limited amount to
neuronal heterotopia in the leptomeninges.<p>

AB: We demonstrated immunohistochemically an abnormal expression of the neural
cell adhesion molecule L1 in 10 developing brains of children with
hemimegalencephaly (HM) aged from 36 weeks gestation to 10 years of age,
comparing them with 23 controls aged from 13 weeks of gestation to 14 years.
There was dense L1 expression in focal regions of the molecular layer beneath
leptomeningeal glioneuronal heterotopia, in areas of cerebral cortex with large
neurons, and in the disorganized or neuronal heterotopic sites in the white
matter in HM. L1 was also heterogeneously enhanced in the abnormal cortex after
1 year of age, suggesting that axonal growth was delayed. These changes
persisted into the older age group in the abnormal areas of cortex in HM. The
cell bodies of many enlarged neurons in HM were immunopositive for L1, whereas
L1 was usually localized to the processes of normal neurons. The delayed L1
immunoreactivity and enlarged L1-immunopositive neurons may be closely related
to the pathogenesis of unilateral megalencephaly with cortical dysplasia and
heterotopia.<p>

AB: We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) at 4.1 tesla
in patients with malformations of cortical development (MCDs) and epilepsy. We
compared the spectroscopic results with normative data using 2 SDs (95%
confidence) above normal values for detection of significant abnormalities for
creatine-N-acetylated compounds (Cr/NA) ratio and choline-N-acetylated
compounds (Cho/NA). The results were correlated with clinical, EEG, and
histologic findings. Patients with focal cortical dysplasia showed significant
metabolic abnormalities in correspondence with the structural lesions, whereas
patients with heterotopia and polymicrogyria demonstrated no subcortical MRSI
abnormalities. Significant correlations were found between the metabolic
abnormalities and the frequency of seizures but not with the degree of
interictal EEG discharges. Quantitative neuronal and glial cell counts revealed
no statistically significant correlation between cell loss and the abnormal
metabolic ratios in those who underwent surgery. These preliminary findings
suggest that MRSI-based metabolic abnormalities in patients with MCDs are
variable and are likely to be associated with complex cellular mechanisms
involving the regulation of NA, total Cr content, and Cho.<p>

AB: X linked subcortical laminar heterotopia and lissencephaly syndrome (XSCLH/
LIS) is an intriguing disorder of cortical development, which causes classical
lissencephaly with severe mental retardation and epilepsy in hemizygous males,
and subcortical laminar heterotopia (SCLH) associated with milder mental
retardation and epilepsy in heterozygous females. Here we report an exclusion
mapping study carried out in three unrelated previously described families in
which males are affected with lissencephaly and females with SCLH, using 38
microsatellite markers evenly distributed on the X chromosome. Most of the X
chromosome was excluded and potential intervals of assignment in Xq22.3-q23 or
in Xq27 are reported. Although the number of informative meioses did not allow
a decision between these two loci, it is worth noting that the former interval
is compatible with the mapping of a breakpoint involved in a de novo
X;autosomal balanced translocation 46,XX,t(X;2)(q22;p25) previously described
in a female with classical lissencephaly. In addition, haplotype inheritance in
two families showed a grandpaternal origin of the mutation and suggested in one
family the presence of mosaicism in germline cells of normal transmitting
males.<p>

AB: OBJECTIVE: To call attention to endometrial pathologies, which in addition
to causing menstrual problems, are a cause of infertility. DESIGN: Controlled
clinical study. SETTING: Specialized unit in the management of infertile
patients. PATIENT(S): Fifteen infertile women between the ages of 26 and 39
years and suffering infertility from endometrial problems for a period of 4 to
18 years were included in the study. Six patients had primary infertility and
nine others had secondary infertility. INTERVENTION(S): Once the endometrial
pathology was diagnosed, treatment was initiated according to the type of
problem: hysteroscopy, curettage, and hormonal replacement with or without
corticoids or antiphymic drugs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Clinical studies,
laboratory tests, hormonal serum levels, and endoscopy. RESULT(S): After
initiating specific treatment for each of the pathologies, menstruation was
re-established in 14 of 15 patients. Nine patients became pregnant (8 of 10
cases with bone, squamous cell, or muscular metaplasia). CONCLUSION(S):
Pathological changes of the endometrium are causes of infertility. These
problems are not as rare as thought. They must be searched for carefully and
diagnosed promptly. The majority carry a good prognosis when adequately
treated.<p>

AB: Hemimegalencephaly (HME), a rare congenital abnormality characterized by
unilateral enlargement of the cerebral hemisphere, is one of the less common
causes of intractable seizures. We report a 6-month-old infant with
uncontrolled seizures who was diagnosed to have a large mass lesion based on a
CT scan. Postmortem examination revealed left-sided HME with pachygyria,
widened cortex, indistinct grey-white junction, and distorted deep nuclear
masses. Histological features included loss of cortical lamination, large
atypical neurons with argyrophilic accumulations, ballooned cells, neuronal
heterotopia, and astrocytosis with dystrophic calcification. The heterotopic
neurons in the white matter were present in a radial pattern suggestive of
aberrant neuronal migration. Several large neurons were dystrophic with
cytoskeletal abnormalities like phosphorylated high molecular weight
neurofilament and ubiquitin in the cytoplasm. However, typical neurofibrillary
tangles with Congo red and tau positivity were not observed. Synaptophysin
labelling was found to be decreased in the cortex, but some of the abnormal
neurons had dense perisomatic label. The majority of the balloon cells were
astrocytic in origin, being positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein and
negative for the neuronal markers. Although the etiology of HME is not known,
it provides an opportunity to study anomalous development of the brain and
neuronal developmental abnormalities.<p>

AB: Cortical malformations such as cortical dysplasia and heterotopia
constitute the underlying pathology of epilepsy and mental retardation. It is
thus important to elucidate the pathogenesis of these migration disorders from
the neuropathological viewpoint based upon animal experiments. In this review,
I describe the experiment in which low-dose prenatal X-or gamma-irradiation was
performed at the mid-gestational period of mice or rats. Low-dose irradiation
as low as 150 mGy induced decelerated migration of cortical neurons during the
embryonic period together with a changed pattern of cell adhesion molecule,
N-CAM. In addition, the effect of radiation remained at least up until 3-week
postnatal as disorganized neuronal allocation with respect to the birthdate.
With time of further maturation in the neocortex, however, the architecture, in
terms of the pattern of distribution of the labeled neurons, returned closely
to that found in non-irradiated control animals. Considering the fact that the
number of labeled cells per unit cortical area decreased considerably from
3-week to 8-week postnatal, it is conceivable that apoptotic cell death might
have occurred in aberrantly placed neurons. Recent progress of molecular
genetical approach to human hereditary neurodevelopmental diseases is briefly
reviewed, since it greatly contributes to our understanding on the pathogenesis
of neuronal migration disorders.<p>

AB: Hemimegalencephaly (HME) is an uncommon sporadic nonfamilial congenital
dysplastic abnormality of the central nervous system, characterized by
enlargement of one cerebral hemisphere, with cranial asymmetry, hemiparesis,
epilepsy, and mental retardation. It can occur in isolation or associated with
various anomalies, namely skin disorders. The main neuropathologic findings are
hemispheric gigantism, macro- and/or micropolygyria, cortical thickening with
lack of lamination, blurred boundaries of the gray and white matter, and large
ortho- and heterotopic neural cells. The results obtained by morphological
investigations carried out on six patients with HME, compared with the findings
recorded in similar studies performed on one patient with tuberous sclerosis
(TS) and another with pachygyria, allow the authors to (a) confirm the
dysplastic nature of HME and its autonomy from TS; (b) demonstrate that ortho-
and heterotopic neuronal cells do not differentiate completely during
proliferation and migration from the germinal matrix; (c) document, by means of
flow cytometric study, a normal euploid DNA content in the enlarged hemisphere,
consequently ruling out heteroploidy as a cause of both cell "hypertrophy" and
enlargement of the malformed cerebral hemisphere.<p>

AB: The marginal zone (MZ) of embryonic neocortex is crucial to its normal
development. We report that neurotrophin-4 (but not NT3 or NGF), applied to
embryonic rodent cortex in vitro or in vivo, produces heterotopic accumulations
of neurons in the MZ. Although heterotopia production is TrkB mediated, BDNF is
&gt;10-fold less effective than NT4. Heterotopic neurons have the same birth
date and phenotype as normal MZ neurons; they are not the result of NT4-induced
proliferation or rescue from apoptosis. We suggest that NT4 causes excess
neurons to migrate into the MZ and thus may play a role in normal MZ formation
as well as in the pathogenesis of certain human cortical dysplasias.<p>

AB: Ibotenate, a glutamatergic agonist, was used to study the spectrum of
excitoxic disturbances at different ages of cerebral development. Cultures of
whole mouse embryo were submitted to ibotenate at E8 for 20 h: during the phase
of early premigratory differentiation: ibotenate did not induce any detectable
histological lesion. During migration of supragranular neurons, newborn
hamsters intracerebrally injected at PO with ibotenate display neuronal
migration disorders graded from nodular heterotopias to extensive laminar
heterotopias mimicking some aspects of lissencephalic and double-cortex
syndromes. After completion of neuronal layer V, PO mice injected with
ibotenate exhibit laminar neuronal depopulation of layer V-VIa mimicking human
microgyria. At P5 in mouse, after completion of neuronal migration of the
cortical plate, ibotenate induces neuronal loss in all cortical layers and the
formation of porencephalic cysts. This study emphasizes the dramatic role
played by glutamate in brain development, in the occurrence of neuronal
migration disorders in the cortex, and in grey and white matter damage.<p>

AB: Hypoxia, ischemia and other forms of brain injury during the pre- and
perinatal period may cause neuronal migration disorders which results in
irreversible structural modifications. In human neocortex, these malformations
have been associated with severe mental retardation, motor dysfunction and the
manifestation of therapy-resistant epilepsy. We were interested in analyzing
the expression of epileptiform activity in an animal model of neocortical
migration disorders. Newborn rats received a focal freeze lesion and were
investigated anatomically and in vitro electrophysiologically after survival
times of up to five months. Anatomic abnormalities included loss of normal
cortical lamination (focal microgyrus) and presence of ectopic cell clusters in
layer I and in the white matter (heterotopia). The functional in vitro analyses
with eight extracellular recording electrodes revealed a prominent
hyperexcitability of the disorganized neocortical network. Electrical
stimulation of the afferents elicited epileptiform responses that propagated
over &gt; 4 mm in the horizontal direction. In untreated and sham-operated
animals, this spread of evoked activity was restricted to 0.5-1 mm.
Epileptiform responses were not significantly affected by APV but blocked by
NBQX, indicating that AMPA receptors play a prominent role in the generation
and propagation of this pathophysiological activity. Our data suggest that the
experimentally induced migration disturbances cause long-term structural and/or
functional modifications in the neocortical network which may form the basis
for the expression of epileptiform activity.<p>

AB: Despite the increasing number of patients affected by neuronal migration
disorders (NMDs) recently diagnosed in vivo by means of magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), few detailed data on the correlation between the
neuroradiological and the anatomical features in the single NMD case are
available. The present paper reports a combined cytoarchitectural and
immunocytochemical analysis, by means of antisera recognizing specific neuronal
and glial markers, of three MRI diagnosed NMD patients surgically treated for
the relief of intractable seizures. The first case was a giant subcortical
nodular heterotopia of morphologically normal neurons lacking any type of
cortical lamination. The second case was a layered polymicrogyria with an
abnormal amount of ectopic neurons in the underlying white matter. The third
case was a focal cortical dysplasia characterized by a dramatic disruption of
the normal cortical layering associated with marked cytological abnormalities.
The present data demonstrate that the macroscopical and microscopical brain
abnormalities can be markedly different in different NMD subtypes, and suggest
that different anatomical substrates can underlie the intrinsic
hyperexcitability of these brain malformations. The relevance of further
prospective clinico-morphological studies for a better understanding of the
mechanisms determining the development of these brain malformations is
underlined.<p>

AB: The results of revision elbow arthroplasty with use of the semiconstrained
Mayo-modified Coonrad implant in forty-one patients were reviewed
retrospectively. The average duration of follow-up was six years (range, two to
thirteen years). At the time of the latest follow-up evaluation, thirty-eight
patients were able to perform activities of daily living, one had a stiff elbow
because of heterotopic ossification, one had weakness secondary to an injury of
the radial nerve, and one had an unstable elbow after removal of the prosthesis
because of recurrent aseptic loosening. Fourteen patients sustained either a
fracture or a perforation of the cortex at the time of removal of the primary
implant. Three of these patients had an injury of the radial nerve; the injury
was due to extravasation of the cement from a cortical defect in two of them
and was sustained during removal of the cement in one. Eight patients had an
intraoperative or postoperative complication that necessitated additional
operative intervention. Postoperatively, twenty-two patients had complete
relief of pain and sixteen had mild discomfort. Three patients remained
disabled: one, because of pain secondary to loosening of the component; one,
because of a pre-existing nerve injury; and one, because of the residual
effects of an intraoperative injury of the radial nerve. The average Mayo elbow
performance score was 87 +/- 16 points at the latest follow-up evaluation,
compared with 44 +/- 17 points preoperatively (p &lt; 0.0001). Revision elbow
arthroplasty restored function to the patients who had had a failed prosthesis
without infection.<p>

AB: We have observed sudden clinical death due to Fukuyama-type congenital
muscular dystrophy (FCMD). In FCMD, brain abnormalities, such as
polymicrogyria, leptomeningeal neuroglial heterotopia and abnormal course of
the corticospinal tracts, are well known. We investigated the brainstem of 10
FCMD and 7 control cases. Among the control cases, 5 with Duchenne type
muscular dystrophy died of heart failure and 2 died accidental death. In the
brainstem, the catecholaminergic neurons characterized by reaction with
antiserum to tyrosin hydroxylase showed notable reduction in the reticular
formation, vagal nuclei, and nucleus tractus solitarius. Delays or aberrations
of neural control may contribute to the pathogenesis of sudden infant death
syndrome, and medullary gliosis occurs in the reticular formation of sudden
infant death syndrome. The pathogenesis of neurons in the brainstem in FCMD may
be similar to that in sudden infant death syndrome. These findings suggest
neuronal dysfunction in the brainstem and may be related to respiratory,
circulatory, or sleep-wake regulation disorders.<p>

AB: We describe the neuropathological features of a complex brain malformation
characterized by cerebral hemihypotrophy with ipsilateral lissencephaly,
periventricular nodular heterotopia and macrogyria. The contralateral
hemisphere showed only slight alterations of the gyral pattern and a limited
periventricular gray matter heterotopia. The clinical picture of the patient,
who died at the age of 15 years, consisted of severe oligophrenia, intractable
seizures and left hemiparesis. We discuss the nosological status of this
neuronal migration disorder of apparently unknown origin.<p>

AB: Neuroimaging is playing an increasingly important role in the evaluation of
patients with malformations of cerebral cortical development. In this review,
the authors address optimal neuroimaging of cortical malformations using x-ray
computed tomography, single-photon-emission computed tomography, positron
emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance
spectroscopy. Initially, the authors discuss the strengths and weaknesses of
the various imaging techniques. This is followed by a discussion of the
clinical and neuroimaging characteristics of several different imaging
manifestations of focal malformations of cortical development, including
polymicrogyria, focal subcortical heterotopia, schizencephaly, focally
thickened gyri, focally irregular gyri, hemimegalencephaly, and transmural
dysplasia. The authors intend that, after reading this review, the reader will
have a better understanding of the optimal neuroimaging techniques for
evaluating these malformations and their many neuroimaging appearances.<p>

AB: INTRODUCTION: Hemimegalencephalus (HM) is a disorder of cerebral migration
characterized by the overdevelopment of one cerebral hemisphere. It is usually
associated with pachygyria, gliosis and neurone loss. We present a study using
stereoscopic magnetic resonance (SMR) in a case of HM confirmed by the
pathologist. CLINICAL CASE: A girl with right HM had hemigeneralized crisis
since birth. A selective right temporoccipital cortectomy was done when she was
two and a half years old. The resected piece showed thickening and absence of
cortical striation, neurone loss, gliosis, giant neurones and heterotopias.
After a symptom-free period the crises reappeared as right fronto-parietal
epileptiform anomalies. When she was four years old SMR was done to compare
this area with the corresponding area of the radiologically normal left
hemisphere. Comparative study showed a marked drop in N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA),
glutamate (Glu) and Gaba, and increased choline (Col) and inositol (Ino). We
found no difference in the creatinine levels. CONCLUSIONS: The histological
findings are in concordance with the levels of metabolites found in the
affected hemisphere. The drop in NAA and Glu is related to neurone loss and the
increase in glial cells, and the increase in Col and Ino with increase in
membranes metabolism, as is observed in the gliosis. SMR is an advance in the
identification and grading of changes seen on conventional MR, when
establishing the prognosis and choice of treatment in HM.<p>

AB: We examined the efficacy of a single application of recombinant human
osteogenic protein-1 (hOP-1, bone morphogenetic protein-7) for its ability to
regenerate large calvarial defects in adult male baboons (Papio ursinus).
Recombinant hOP-1, in conjunction with baboon or bovine guanidinium-extracted
insoluble collagenous bone matrix (0.1, 0.5 and 2.5 mg per g of collagenous
matrix as carrier), was implanted in 46 calvarial defects surgically prepared
in 14 baboons, whilst 18 defects were implanted with the carrier matrix without
hOP-1. Specimens were harvested on d 15, 30, 90 and 365 and subjected to
histomorphometry on serial undecalcified sections cut at 7 microm to study the
temporal sequence of tissue morphogenesis after the single application of
hOP-1. Histological analysis indicated that the induction of new bone formation
proceeded from the periphery to the central core of hOP-1 treated specimens
after rapid angiogenesis and mesenchymal cell migration in apposition to the
collagenous matrix. Whilst chondrogenesis was limited, newly formed bone has
already filled with fully differentiated bone marrow elements as early as d 15,
even with the 0.1 mg dose of hOP-1. On d 30 and 90, doses of 0.1 and 0.5 mg of
hOP-1 showed greater amounts of bone than controls, and on d 90, they induced
complete regeneration of the defects. Doses of 2.5 mg hOP-1 per g of matrix
induced extensive osteogenesis initially with heterotopic ossification and
displacement of the temporalis muscle above the defects. One year after
implantation of hOP-1 there was restoration of the internal and external
cortices of the calvaria. These results show that hOP-1 induces complete
regeneration of calvarial bone in the adult primate, and suggest that the
optimal activity of hOP-1 to achieve regeneration is between 100 and 500 microg
of hOP-1 per g of matrix. These results in the primate may form the scientific
basis for future clinical applications of hOP-1.<p>

AB: OBJECTIVE: To describe 3 sisters with brain periventricular heterotopia and
peculiar dysmorphic features as a probable X-linked dominant trait. DESIGN:
Clinical, laboratory, neurophysiological, and brain imaging data were studied.
SETTING: Research institute for mental retardation. PATIENTS: The 3 sisters had
mental retardation, drug-resistant epilepsy, gray matter heterotopia, and
peculiar malformations (low nasal bridge, upslanting palpebral fissures,
palpebral edema, attached hypoplastic earlobes, thickened calvaria, rectal
fibrovascular polyps, urinary tract anomalies, and increased foot length). The
patients were 35, 30, and 25 years old and belonged to a sibship of 6, born of
nonconsanguineous healthy parents. CONCLUSION: The 3 patients constitute a
well-defined clinical entity not previously described of a probable X-linked
dominant nature.<p>

cerebro-oculo-cutaneous malformations is presented. The brain dysgenesias
consist of early disturbances of neuronal migration. They result on appearance
of nodular subcortical heterotopias, cortical anomalies including pachy- and
polymicrogyria and focal intrusion of numerous abnormally migrating nerve cells
into leptomeninges. A various degree of nerve and glial cell maturity was
observed within heterotopic tissue. The other malformations include eye, skin
and internal organs anomalies. Similarities and differences between our case
and another previously described cases were discussed but it seems difficult to
include the analysed case into one of the known syndromes.<p>

AB: Hereditary cerebellar vermis defect rats (CVD), a new neurological mutant,
developed disorganized cerebellar cortical tissues. The postnatal development
of the cerebellum in the CVD was examined histologically and
immunohistochemically. A main pathological change in the CVD was abnormal
perivascular cell aggregations, beginning to be observed from postnatal day 5.
Around postnatal day 14, perivascular cells increased in number and many of
them showed vigorous bromodeoxyuridine incorporation activities, as seen in the
normal external granule cells (EGCs). The perivascular cells and EGCs were
strongly positive for low affinity nerve growth factor receptor. These
immunohistochemical results revealed that abnormal perivascular cells were
heterotopic EGCs. The perivascular cells led to dysplastic abnormalities of
lamination and abnormal cell positioning in the CVD. These findings indicate
that abnormal perivascular aggregations of EGCs play an important role in the
pathogenesis for cerebellar cortical dysplasia of CVD.<p>

AB: The influence of the excitotoxic cascade on the developing brain was
investigated using ibotenate, a glutamatergic agonist of both
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) ionotropic receptors and metabotropic receptors.
Injected in the neopallium of the golden hamster at the time of production of
neurons normally destined for layers IV, III, and II, ibotenate induces arrests
of migrating neurons at different distances from the germinative zone within
the radial migratory corridors. The resulting cytoarchitectonic patterns
include periventricular nodular heterotopias, subcortical band heterotopias,
and intracortical arrests of migrating neurons. The radial glial cells and the
extracellular matrix are free of detectable damage that could suggest a defect
in their guiding role. The migration disorders are prevented by coinjection of
DL-2-amino-7-phosphoheptanoic acid, an NMDA ionotropic antagonist, but are not
prevented by coinjection of L(+)-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid, a
metabotropic antagonist. This implies that an excess of ionic influx through
the NMDA channels of neurons alters the metabolic pathways supporting neuronal
migration. Ibotenate, a unique molecular trigger of the excitotoxic cascade,
produces a wide spectrum of abnormal neuronal migration patterns recognized in
mammals, including the neocortical deviations encountered in the human brain.<p>

AB: Few studies have examined the clinical features of neocortical temporal
lobe epilepsy (NTLE) in carefully selected patients. We reviewed records from
21 patients with NTLE, defined by intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG), who
have been seizure free for 1 year or more following temporal lobectomy. The
mean age of onset at the time of first seizure was 14 years (range, 1-41
years). Febrile seizures were reported in only 2 patients (9.5%). In contrast
to prior mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) studies, seizure-free intervals
between the initial cerebral insult or first seizure and habitual seizures were
uncommon. Possible or known risk factors for epilepsy were reported in 13 of 21
patients (62%). Fifteen (71%) patients reported auras, with experiential
phenomena being the most common type. Magnetic resonance imaging was normal or
nonspecific in 15 patients, revealed mild hippocampal atrophy in 2, tumors in
2, and heterotopic gray matter and hippocampal atrophy in 1, and cortical
dysgenesis in 1. Neuropsychological testing showed deficits consistent with the
seizure focus in 13 patients (62%), and Wada test showed ipsilateral memory
deficits in 10 (48%). The most common behavioral manifestation was a motionless
stare at ictal onset (48%). In contrast to prior studies of MTLE, only 1 NTLE
patient had frequent independent, contralateral temporal lobe epileptiform
spikes on scalp EEG.<p>

AB: Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is being increasingly
used in the investigation of children with epilepsy and may provide insights
into congenital malformations. We analyzed the interictal 99Tc-HMPAO-SPECT in a
series of seven children with developmental disorders of the neocortex, each of
them representing a prototype of cerebral dysgenesis, such as lissencephaly,
pachygyria, opercular dysplasia, polymicrogyria, nodular heterotopia and band
heterotopia. The patients studied were selected among 22 epileptic children
with neuronal migrational disorders (NMDs). Interictal SPECT hypoperfusion was
observed in the area homologous to MRI findings in all the examined children.
In three patients low perfusion was also present in the opposite hemisphere,
probably due to functional involvement or related to an underlying
microdysgenesis, not revealed by structural imaging. EEG features were in
agreement with low perfusion areas, both anatomically and functionally, in all
children. In one patient hypoperfusion area differed from that revealed by MRI
and EEG. Ictal SPECT has been considered a useful tool for accurately locating
the epileptic focus. Nevertheless, interictal brain perfusion studies, together
with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, may play an important role in
detecting anatomic substrate in developmental disorders of the neocortex.<p>

AB: BACKGROUND: Adrenal gland autotransplantation, a model of cortical tissue
regeneration, provides the reconstruction of distinct functional and
morphological zonae. A morphological and biochemical study of the adrenal gland
of adult male rats after autotransplantation and endothelin-1 (ET-1)
administration was made. METHODS: The technique involved bilateral
adrenalectomy and placement of pieces of the adrenal gland in a dorsal plane
between the skin and muscle. The animals were killed 90 days after the
autotransplantation and 1 hr after intravenous ET-1 administration (0.5
microgram/kg body weight). The autotransplanted pieces were removed, fixed, and
processed for light and electron microscopic morphologic studies. Trunk blood
was collected for steroid assay. RESULTS: Saline-treated control
autotransplanted animals showed no remarkable differences in adrenal
organization; grafts exhibiting a mass of regenerated cortical tissue were
arranged in nests of glandular cells surrounded by a fibrous capsule and
intersected by layers of connective tissue. The adrenal medulla was
systematically absent. Ultrastructure of ET-1-treated animals revealed an inner
area in the graft, consisting mainly of fasciculatalike cells. Cytoplasmic
changes were evident, with high variations in mitochondrial size and
arrangement. Profiles of smooth endoplasmic reticulum sometimes exhibited
evidence of hypertrophy. Glandular cells in the graft outer area (subcapsular)
were almost invariably like glomerulosa; however, some of them showed
mitochondria with a peculiar arrangement of the cristae. "Hybrid" cells with
mitochondria resembling those of the zona reticularis were also observed in the
subcapsular environment. ET-1-stimulated animals showed significant increases
in plasma corticosterone and aldosterone concentrations. CONCLUSIONS:
Endothelin-1, previously reported to stimulate acutely the aldosterone
secretion by the adrenal zona glomerulosa in the rat, seems to exert a
modulator role on the physiology of adrenal autotransplants, their regeneration
and secretion.<p>

AB: The capabilities and limitations of clinical diagnoses, particularly brain
imaging of cortical anomalies, in developmentally disabled children are
reviewed. Some aspects of diagnostic problems in generalized cortical
dysgeneses, like lissencephaly type I and II, subcortical heterotopias,
generalized polymicrogyria, or focal cortical anomalies and primary
micrencephalies, are discussed.<p>

AB: To establish developmental correlates among perinatal neocortical damage,
its impact on the infant developing brain, and its possible role in the
pathogenesis of ensuing neurologic sequelae, the neuropathology of acute,
subacute (healing), and chronic (repaired) stages of periventricular and layer
I (subpial) hemorrhagic lesions have been studied. Thirty-three cases of
infants who survived brain damage for hours, days, weeks, months, and/or years
and have been studied with the rapid Golgi and other methods. In
periventricular hemorrhagic injury: (a) the local destruction of radial glia
stop all cellular migration above the lesion; (b) precursor cells already
traveling in damaged radial glia also stop their migration, miss their target,
and form acquired heterotopias; and, (c) the cytoarchitecture of the overlying
and differentiating gray matter may be secondarily altered. In layer I
(subpial) hemorrhagic injury: (a) the neocortex external glial limiting
membrane is disrupted and must be repaired; (b) its reparation often causes
superficial leptomeningeal heterotopias; (c) the cytoarchitecture and intrinsic
circuitry of layer I and underlying gray matter are secondarily altered; and,
(d) partially damaged (pruning) and/or displaced gray matter neurons undergo
post-injury morphologic transformations, atrophy, hypertrophy, and
reestablished new "abnormal" connections. These post-injury gray matter
cytoarchitectural alterations could eventually play a role in cortical
dysfunction and, hence, in the pathogenesis of neurologic sequelae.<p>

AB: We reported a case of type I lissencephaly/pachygyria which had cystic
changes in the periventricular white matter and lentiform nuclei. The patient
developed neonatal seizures and was referred to Anjo Kosei Hospital His
seizures were frequent and refractory to anticonvulsants. His development was
severely retarded. CT and MRI revealed cystic changes in the periventricular
white matter and lentiform nuclei as well as bilateral diffuse pachygyria and
agenesis of corpus callosum. He died of unknown cause at 5 months of age and
postmortem examination was performed. Type I lissencephaly/pachygyria, almost
complete agenesis of corpus callosum, leptomeningeal glioneuronal heterotopia
and hypoplasia of corticospinal tract were seen pathologically. Marked gliosis
and CD 68 positive macrophages were found around the cystic lesions in the
periventricular white matter and lentiform nuclei, which suggests that these
lesions were the secondarily destructive lesion. We considered that these
secondary lesions were due to frequent seizures which could cause insufficient
supply of blood and glucose in those areas.<p>

AB: Various cortical dysplasias, such as agyria-lissencephalia, pachygyria,
micropolygyria, neuronal heterotopia and so on, have become relatively common
neuropathological findings among the children with intactable epilepsy and
mental and/or physical handicap. Together with various environmental factors,
gene abnormalities are recently increasing as a cause in various cortical
dysplasias. However, details of the pathogenesis still remain unknown.
Experimental studies using animal models indicated that inhibition of neuron
production, disorders of neuron-glia and neuron-neuron contact, and plastic and
unbalanced synaptogenesis subsequent to abnormal neuron production play an
important role either separately or in combination in the pathogenesis of
various cortical dysplasias.<p>
