<a NAME="spiral_arms"></a><i>Spiral arms of galaxies would have broken
up within a few 10's of thousands of years. Scientists proposed that this
would not be a problem because the spiral arms are maintained by density
waves. However, the density wave idea has been messed up by recent Hubble
observations.&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;</li>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<ul>There is much to be learned about spiral galaxies, including how long
they maintain their spiral structure. Although creationists claim that
recent observations from the Hubble Space Telescope present problems for
the density wave explanation of the spiral structures, this does not mean
that an explanation will never be found that reconciles theory to observations.&nbsp;
That's the beauty of science - its theories are constantly evaluated against
observed data, and if the data so indicates, the theory is modified or
rejected as required. This indicates huge weakness in many creationist
arguments. Rather than indications of a young earth, their examples are
often simply phenomena that scientists do not fully understand. Eventually,
when they are fully understood, the vast majority of scientists expect
that these phenomena will be consistent with an ancient earth / universe.</ul>

</blockquote>

<ul>
<ul>The excess heat of Jupiter is an interesting question that is unanswered
at this time. On the other hand, there is much we don't know about Jupiter
and the other distant planets of the solar system, and much that we have
only recently learned. Given the overwhelming evidence of for an ancient
solar system and the great deal we do not yet know about Jupiter, it is
far more likely that Jupiter's excess heat will eventually be explained
by some process we do not currently understand fully. I think these are
very tentative explanations at best, but they show that there are other
explanations for the claims of creationists other than that the earth and
universe are less than 10,000 years old.&nbsp;
<p>One possible explanation:&nbsp;
<ul><a href="http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~abstract/abstracts/S202P.html#abstract45">Can
D-D fusion explain Jupiter's excess heat?</a></ul>

<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Nordita, Copenhagen, Denmark&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>We explore the possibility of Deuterium-Deuterium (D-D) fusion in the
interior of Jupiter. Our interest on investigating such an energy source
resulted from the recent extrapolations of D-D fusion cross-section to
eV temperatures which suggest D-D fusion as a potential energy source inside
Jupiter. We speculate that D could have been brought deep inside the planet
by planetesimals (during the process of planet formation) and deposited
through planetesimal/ices vaporization. We estimate that with a modest
degree of interior stratification of D (5\%$-$10\% of the total D of the
planet or $1.0-3.0\times 10^{-4}M_{\oplus}$), during the early stages of
the planet formation, D-D energy generation has the potential of contributing
to the planet's excess heat while keeping the planet's interior stable
to convection. The amount of D needed in our speculative model implies
planetesimal/ices vaporization efficiency of 5$-$10\% during Jupiter formation
(core-instability scenario).</ul>

<p><br>Possible, partial explanation from <a href="http://www.seds.org/nineplanets/nineplanets/jupiter.html">Students
for the Exploration and Development of Space</a>:&nbsp;
<ul>Jupiter radiates more energy into space than it receives from the Sun.
The interior of Jupiter is hot: the core is probably about 20,000 K. The
heat is generated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism, the slow gravitational
compression of the planet. (Jupiter does NOT produce energy by nuclear
fusion as in the Sun; it is much too small and hence its interior is too
cool to ignite nuclear reactions.) This interior heat probably causes convection
deep within Jupiter's liquid layers and is probably responsible for the
complex motions we see in the cloud tops. Saturn and Neptune are similar
to Jupiter in this respect, but oddly, Uranus is not.</ul>

but shows signs of volcanic activity. Io should have also cooled solid,
but satellite photos of volcanic eruptions have been made.</i>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>Ganymede and Io are under the influence of extremely powerful tidal
forces from Jupiter. These forces are enough to keep those planets geologically
active. See, for example, <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/news/thiswk/today000710.html">Galileo
Continues to Return Data from February's Flyby of Io</a> from NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. The following is a pertinent extract from that article
(emphasis mine):&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>Io is the most volcanically active body in our solar system. A little
larger than Earth's&nbsp; moon, Io is the third largest of Jupiter's moons,
and the fifth one in distance from the planet. Of the four largest of Jupiter's
known 16 moons, Io is the closest to Jupiter. The largest four of Jupiter's
moons are also known as the Galilean moons. <b>Io is close enough to Jupiter
that the huge planet causes tremendous tidal forces</b> on the smaller,
more volatile moon. <b>The tidal forces can cause the surface to bulge
up and down (or in and out) by as much as 100 meters (330 feet)!</b> By
comparison, typical ocean tides on Earth amount to only 2 meters (6.5 feet)
between low and high tides, and this for water, not solid ground! The tides
in the solid body of the Earth are much smaller still. <b>This tidal pumping
generates a tremendous amount of heat within Io, keeping much of its subsurface
crust in molten form.</b> The heat seeks any available escape route to
relieve the pressure, causing volcanic plumes rise as high as 300 kilometers
(190 miles) above the surface.&nbsp;
<p>Also, see "<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/2001/release_2001_240.html">Jupiter's
Io Generates Power And Noise, But No Magnetic Field</a>" from a December
10<sup>th</sup>, 2001 report, also <b>NASA</b>..&nbsp;
<ul><i>"There's no intrinsic field," Kivelson said. "We can put that question
to rest." That means Io's molten iron core does not have the same type
of convective overturning by which Earth's molten core generates Earth's
magnetic field. <b>Lack of that overturning fits a model of Io's core being
heated from the outside, by tidal flexing of the layers around it, rather
than being heated from the center.&nbsp;</b></i>
<p><i><b>The heat generated inside Io by the tidal tug of Jupiter</b> makes
this moon the most volcanically active world in the solar system.</i>

<ul>
<ul>Very little is known about Saturn's rings. Saturn's moons certainly
affect the layout of the rings over time (including the F-ring, which appears
to be shepherded by two small moons - see <a href="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/saturn.htm">Saturn</a>
and <a href="http://www.solarviews.com/cap/sat/fring.htm">Saturn's F-Ring</a>
from the Hawaiian Astronomical Society). Whether the F-ring section of
Saturn's rings existed over 10,000 years ago has no bearing on the age
of the earth or the age of the solar system. In fact, here is a great article
from the Royal Astronomical Society Press Notices that shows that the F-ring
changed quite a bit in just nine months! See <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~carlkop/strand.html">Interweaving
Strands Braid Saturn's Strange F-Ring</a>. How in the world could creationists
think that such a volatile phenomenon has any bearing on the age of the
earth? Additionally, based upon these observations, I wonder how the creationists
came up with their estimate that the F-ring section could have lasted only
10,000 years?

<a NAME="mag_field_decay_C14"></a><i>Earth's magnetic field would have
stopped C14 dating no more than 1500 years ago.&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;</li>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<ul>The generation of C14 is affected by the earth's magnetic field. A
strong increase in the magnetic field would deflect gamma radiation and
reduce or halt the production of C14. Nonetheless, as the creationist idea
that the earth's magnetic field has been constantly decaying has been rebutted
immediately above, the claim regarding accuracy of C14 data is invalid.
Interestingly, if it is true that an increasing magnetic would make C14
dating invalid after 1500 years,&nbsp; the fact that C14 has been used
to accurately date historical objects older than this is further evidence
that the earth's magnetic field has not been decaying in the matter claimed
by creationists.&nbsp;
<p><i>The accuracy of radiocarbon dating was tested on objects with dates
that were already known through historical records such as parts of the
dead sea scrolls and some wood from an Egyptian tomb. Based on the results
of the Carbon 14 test the analysis showed that C14 agreed very closely
with the historical information.</i> ( <a href="http://emuseum.mnsu.edu/archaeology/dating/radio_carbon.html">Dating
Exhibit</a> <b>)</b>
<p>Additionally, such a reduction in C14 would be immediately obvious when
calibrating the C14 data against tree ring data. We would see the ages
of tree rings rising much too rapidly over the past 1500 years until we
started seeing ages of 50,000 to 100,000 (the limit of age detection for
C14) years for rings that are more than 1500 years old. The studies that
calibrate C14 dates against tree rings, annual layers in lakes, and coral
dates all show that this is not the case.

<ol>
<ol>This appears to refer to claims made by creationist Ken Hovind. These
claims have been thoroughly rebutted as a huge error on Hovind's part.
The most charitable explanation that can be proposed for Hovind's claims
are that he misread the original paper and missed the fact that the different
dates given were not for the same mammoth but for different mammoths. From
"<a href="http://inia.cls.org/~ae/ar_hb2548.htm">Arkansas House Bill 2548
is a composite of anti-evolutionary sources</a>" by Wesley R. Elsberry.</ol>

<ol>

dated at 29,500 years and another part at 44,000 years;"</ol>

<li>
<b>Anti-evolutionary source:</b> Creation Science Evangelism&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Critical Summary:</b> The bill's text credulously relies upon a claim
by Kent Hovind that certain C14 dates were taken from a single specimen
of mammoth and yielded discordant results. In fact, an examination of the
original paper cited by Hovind reveals that there was no single specimen
identified as "the Vollosovitch mammoth" from which multiple dates were
obtained, and that the specimens which did yield the dates given by Hovind
were collected by different people at different locations at different
times. Assessment: The bill presents information about the primary literature
that is false to fact, and misleads by implying that C14 and other radioisotope
dating methods cannot be reliably employed. This bill serves the anti-evolutionary
agenda by implying that the label of "theory" means that students should
have low confidence in the concepts and the empirical data which supports
those concepts. This polemical content is profoundly anti-scientific in
effect.&nbsp;</li>

<ul>&nbsp;It should be noted that Kent Hovind was notified in correspondence
with Skip Evans that this example was invalid. Hovind promised to check
his&nbsp; source and correct the information on his web pages. No such
change to Hovind's web page has occurred as of 2001/03/28. Thus, Hovind
is a possible source for a false or fraudulent claim put into a bill which
aims to outlaw false or fraudulent claims, and Hovind testified to the
Arkansas legislature in support of the bill including that false or fraudulent
claim after having been informed of its falsity.

<p>Additionally, were it not for the destructive acts of mankind, there
would be trees 5,000 years old or older alive today. Who knows how old
some trees may have been that were destroyed without inspection.&nbsp;
The following excerpt from <a href="http://wneo.org/gasp/October1999/october8.htm">Gary
Nero</a> recounts some information he learned about&nbsp; Great Basin National
Park:&nbsp;
<ul>Back to 1964. In the time before this became a National Park, a geologist
was doing a research project here and thought he had found the&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;oldest living tree on Earth. He attempted to prove this by using
the aforementioned increment borer, but his drill bit broke part way into
the tree. Apparently he didn't have another bit, so he requested and was
inexplicably granted (by the National Forest Service) permission to cut
down the tree. His eye as a geologist was much better than his sense of
responsibility, as it was determined (by growth ring count) that the tree
was 4950 years old and was indeed the oldest living thing ever found on
Earth. A slice of this tree, now called Prometheus, is on display in the
Visitor Center. If not for this idiot geologist in 1964, however, I would
have been able to see, and perhaps even touch, the oldest living thing
on Earth. Instead it becomes just a footnote for my Journal: "I saw a slice
of Prometheus at the Visitor Center in Great Basin National Park – now
known as the oldest living thing ever killed by man."&nbsp;</ul>
Additionally, there is evidence of plants that have survived much more
than 4,300 or even 5,000. The "King Clone" is a creosote bush near Victorville,
CA that is estimated to be 11,700 years old. Additionally, see <a href="http://www.ou.edu/cas/botany-micro/ben/ben149.html">Botanical
Electronic News - BEN #149</a>&nbsp; and&nbsp; <a href="http://www.exn.ca/Stories/1996/10/21/01.asp">Tasmanian
bush could be oldest living organism</a> for a clonal shrub that may have
been alive for 40,000 years.

<ol>
<ol>None of these examples are naturally occurring stalactites / stalagmites.
It would be interesting if anyone were to demonstrate that naturally occurring
stalactites / stalagmites were growing at a rate of tens of thousands of
times faster than the 1 inch per 1,000 years that creationists say is the
typical growth rate claimed by scientists. However, even if such high rates
were found, although it would demonstrate that scientists can sometimes
make a mistake (if they do claim that all stalactites / stalagmites grow
at a rate of 1 inch per thousand years), it would only show that these
structures are capable of faster growth than scientists thought. It says
nothing much about the maximum age of the earth, which is the reason creationists
give for presenting this evidence.&nbsp;

<ul>
<ul>Actually, there is nothing terribly surprising about fossils such as
this. Whenever animal carcasses fall into water that has little or no oxygen,
they are preserved. This is because the the decay process is slowed down
greatly in water without much oxygen, increasing the chances that the carcass
is preserved until it is covered with sediments. These fossils show that
the animals were quickly killed and undisturbed while fossilizing, but
they show nothing about how long the process of fossilization took.

<a NAME="circular_dating"></a><i>Scientists dated fossils by the rock layers
they were found in and rock layers were dated by the fossils found in them.
This is circular reasoning.&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;</li>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<ul>This is one of the more nonsensical statements that creationists frequently
make. The relative age of the layers were determined by the order in which
they were found together. For example, in undisturbed locations where Cretaceous
Era layers and Jurassic Era layers are found together, the Jurassic Era
layer always lies beneath the Cretaceous Era layer. The geological principal
of superposition says that in geologically undisturbed areas, younger layers
will be found on top of older layers. (The reason the layers must be relatively
undisturbed is that sometimes sections of rock can slide over one another
or be inverted due to major geologic activity. Geologists are quite aware
of this and can easily tell when it has occurred.)&nbsp;
<p>This should all be seen as nothing but good common sense for most people
- the lower layers must be older because they have to be in place first
for the younger layers to be deposited upon them. As I said, when the layers
are found together in undisturbed locations, they are always found in the
proper order. Certain fossils in those layers are used to identify the
layers when they are not found together. (We hardly ever see all of the
geologic layers in a single location because there is almost always going
to be a time at any given location when either no sediments are deposited
or erosion occurs that removes sediments that were previously deposited.)&nbsp;
<p>At any rate, the principal of superposition is one method that gives
a relative age of geologic levels independent of the fossils found in the
layer. Additionally, when radiometric dating became available, it gave
absolute dates for the layers completely independent of the index fossils
and the depositional order of the layers. If radiometric dating was as
bad as creationists claim that it is, we would never see the agreement
of the absolute radiometric dates with the relative ages determined for
the layers through the principal of superposition.&nbsp;

<ol>
<ol>This is a perfect example of a wrong conclusion reached because of
the wrong assumptions of creationism. Scientists have recently started
estimating the mutation rates in humans and other animals. The current
estimates are higher than scientists think can be removed using the current
models of population genetics. Since there is overwhelming evidence that
the lineages leading to humans and the other animals have existed for billions
of years, scientists are confident that there is an explanation this mutation
rate. The most likely explanation is that there is a mechanism that allows
populations to rid themselves of deleterious mutations at a faster rate
than the current models predict. Other possibilities are that the current
estimates of the mutation rates are higher than the actual mutation rates,
or that the estimates are correct, but have recently increased. The important
thing is that scientists are currently doing research to increase their
understanding of mutation rates instead of just assuming that they already
know everything they need to about the rates because they agree with some
preconceived notion of what the world should be like.&nbsp;

<li>
<a NAME="science_religion"></a><i>Science is often pure religion.</i>&nbsp;</li>

<ul>This is a classic case of projection by many creationists. Obviously,
creationism <b>is</b> pure religion. I don't think many creationists would
deny that or even want to deny it, for that matter. Science, however, is
not a religion. It is simply a way to learn about the world around us -
by using the scientific method. This is the concept that we can a. observe
the and describe parts of the world around us, b. form hypothesis that
explain those observations, c. make predictions based upon those hypothesis,
and d. design tests (experiments) that validate or disprove those predictions.
There is nothing religious about the scientific method - other than the
"belief" that one can learn something useful using the method; a belief
that has been demonstrated thousands of times to the great benefit of humanity
over the last several hundred years.&nbsp;
<p>To the best of my knowledge, the VAST majority of creationists (especially
of the young earth variety) believe the way they do solely to
<br>preserve their literal interpretation of Genesis (or some other religious
writings in the case of the couple of Hindus I have come across over the
years). That has been my experience from years of debating creationists
- I can think of literally only 1 or 2 who might not be fundamentalists,
and
<br>even then, I'm not sure. On the other hand, scientists reached the
tentative conclusion that the earth was much, much older than 10,000 years
old starting about 300 years - see&nbsp; http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/geohist.html
for an introduction to that history. Scientists almost uniformly agree
that the earth is ancient because that is where the evidence has taken
them, not because of some preconceived notion that the earth MUST be 10,000
years old due to a literal translation of scripture. Additionally, many
Christians do not accept this literal translation - many scientists who
accept common ancestry and an ancient age of the earth are Christians.&nbsp;
<p>When it comes to religious beliefs, scientists (like the rest of us)
hold a wide range of faiths. This can range from the militant atheism of
Richard Dawkins to a strong belief in Christianity that we see in scientists
such as <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/08/1/l_081_01.html">Ken
Miller</a>. The fact is that while scientists in general hold a wide range
of beliefs, it is the creationist organizations that often explicitly state
what religious beliefs their members must hold. See, for example, <a href="http://www.creationresearch.org/belief_wndw.htm">CRS
Statement of Belief</a> and <a href="http://www.icr.org/abouticr/tenets.htm">ICR
Tenets of Creationism</a> for two examples. It should be clear to anyone
that we will never see objective research coming from organizations that
put so much emphasis on statements of belief as these creationist organizations
do.&nbsp;
<p>See the essay <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-god.html">God
and Evolution</a> by&nbsp; Warren Kurt VonRoeschlaub for more information
on science and religion. Here is an interesting article from the American
Geological Institute - <a href="http://www.geotimes.org/dec00/faith_feature.html?sid=fe38ea57eab0c0904731a9828507944f">Evolution
and Faith</a> by Patricia H. Kelley . It goes into some good detail about
why creationism is not science. Another excellent article is&nbsp; <a href="http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/Bible-Science/Wiens.html">Radiometric
Dating: A Christian Perspective by Roger C. Wiens -- A resource paper of
the American Scientific Affiliation and the Affiliation of Christian Geologists</a>
.
<p><a NAME="creationism_science"></a>If creationists want creationism to
be taken seriously as science, instead of just doing seminars, making web
pages, and writing books aimed at the general public, they should be taking
their arguments directly to the scientific community. The way to do this
is through the peer reviewed scientific journals, such as <a href="http://www.pnas.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml">Nature
and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&nbsp; (PNAS)</a>, and
<a href="http://evol.allenpress.com/evolonline/?request=get-archive">Evolution</a>.
<p>Now I am not saying that they should be producing articles that say
the earth and all life was created only 10,000 years ago. That would never
get published at this point because there are mountains of evidence against
it. However, creationists could be chipping away at those mountains
<br>of evidence by publishing papers that document (what they claim) are
problems with current theory. Such articles are published all the time
by scientists, but the attempt is virtually never made by creationists.
A good example would be Brown's hydroplate theory - he should be able to
<br>publish evidence that supports his theory if it exists, but he refuses
to do so. Most people familiar with this fact believe that it is because
the creationists know that their ideas would be torn to shreds by the scientific
community if they were ever judged by working, non-creationist
<br>scientists.

<ul>&nbsp;
<br>Regardless of its accuracy (which I question), this claim is interesting
in that it represents one of the major concerns of creationists. The interesting
thing is that the creationists themselves may be setting up a situation
that gives these children a reason to question their faith. The creationists
teach (often in church) that the earth is 6,000 to 10,000 years old and
that all life was created within a few days. When a child who was taught
this sees the overwhelming evidence for an ancient earth and common ancestry
of life, he or she immediately becomes aware of the fact that they were
taught material in church that is entirely false. When they see how wrong
the church is on these matters, it is not very surprising that some might
begin to question the teachings of the church on other matters, including
the basic tenets of the faith. It is for this reason, if nothing else,
that young earth creationists should take a long, hard look at the claims
they make (young earth and no common descent). It is their own children
that they may be setting up to fall away from their faith as long as they
continue to teach these ideas that are so easily shown to be false.&nbsp;

<a NAME="assumptions"></a><i>Scientists make lots of bad assumptions when
it comes to radiometric dating. They do not test those assumptions.</i>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>This is another great fabrication of creationists. Part of his problem
arises from his misunderstanding of how scientists use the word assumption.
In the case of radiometric dating, an assumption is a condition that must
be met in order for a test to report an accurate date. Scientists do not
just <b>assume</b> these conditions have been met, they perform tests and
make observations on each sample they collect to determine whether or not
the conditions for an accurate test are in place. Additionally, many experiments
have been performed over the years specifically to test whether or not
particular types of samples meet the conditions for radiometric dating.
Some minerals and conditions have been shown to be poor candidates for
particular dating methods, whereas other minerals appear to give excellent
dates under some conditions for particular radiometric dating methods.
Generally, there are three conditions that are required to obtain a valid
radiometric date for a particular sample:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
The sample must either have had none of the daughter element present when
it was formed <b>or</b>, if there was daughter element present at the time
of formation, scientists must be able to calculate the amount of daughter
element present at that time.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
The radiometric decay constant for the element must have remained constant
from the time the time of formation of the sample until the time the radiometric
date of the sample is measured.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
The sample must have remained closed to gain or loss of both the parent
and daughter elements over its lifetime. This means that none of the parent
element may have entered the sample or left the sample (other than by radioactive
decay to the daughter element) and none of the daughter element may have
left the sample nor entered it (except by radioactive decay of the parent
element). Scientist have certainly not just assumed that any of these three
conditions are true for all elements and conditions - they have performed
many experiments over the years to verify when these conditions are true
and when they are not true.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p><br>The most basic of the three assumptions is that the radiometric
decay constants have remained unchanged throughout time and under all natural
conditions (#2 above). Contrary to creationist assertions, this assumption
has been tested repeatedly by scientists in the roughly one hundred years
since the discovery of radiometric decay.&nbsp;
<ul>&nbsp;</ul>
Referring to alpha, beta, and gamma radiation, Dalrymple says the following
[note that <font face="Symbol">a</font>, <font face="Symbol">b</font>,
and <font face="Symbol">g </font>should appear as the symbols for alpha,
beta, and gamma (radiation types)]:
<ul>&nbsp;
<br>Because these types of radioactive decay occur spontaneously in the
nucleus of an atom, the decay rates are, in essence, unaffected by physical
or chemical conditions. The reasons for this are that the distances over
which nuclear forces act are much smaller than the distances between nuclei,
and that the amounts of energy involved in nuclear transformations are
much greater than the amounts of energy involved in normal chemical reactions
or normal physical conditions. Put another way, the "glue" holding the
nucleus together is very effective and the nucleus is very well insulated
from the external world by the electron cloud surrounding every atom. The
combination of insulation of the nucleus and the strength of nuclear binding
is the reason why scientists must use powerful accelerators or atomic reactors
to penetrate and induce changes in the nuclei of atoms.
<p>A great many experiments have been done in attempts to change radioactive
decay rates, but these have invariably failed to produce significant changes.
It has been found, for example, that decay constants are the same at a
temperature of 2000&deg; C or at a temperature of -186&deg; C, and are
the same in a vacuum or under a pressure of several thousand atmospheres.
Changes in <font face="Symbol">a</font>, <font face="Symbol">b</font>,
and <font face="Symbol">g</font> decay rates are theoretically possible,
but theory predicts that such changes would be very small (Emery, 1972)
and would not affect dating methods.
<p>There is a fourth type of decay that can be affected by physical and
chemical conditions, but only very slightly. This type of decay is electron
capture (ec), in which an orbital electron falls into the nucleus and a
proton is converted into a neutron. Because this type of decay involves
a particle outside the nucleus, the decay rate may be affected by variations
in the electron density near the nucleus of the atom. For example, the
decay constant of <sup>7</sup>Be in the metal and in several beryllium
chemical compounds varies by as much as 0.07 percent (Emery, 1972). The
only isotope of geologic interest that undergoes decay by electron capture
is <sup>40</sup>K, which is the parent isotope of the K-Ar method. Measurements
of the decay rate of <sup>40</sup>K in different substances under a variety
of conditions indicate that varying the chemical and physical environment
has no detectable effect on its electron-capture decay constant.
<p>[Concluding, on pg. 15 after discussion of some issues raised by Morris]
<br>Thus there are both theoretical and experimental reasons to conclude
that radioactive decay rates are constant within the range of physical
and chemical conditions affecting rocks available to scientists. There
is also no evidence of mysterious perturbing factors, such as those invoked
by Morris (1974). Confirmation of the constancy of decay also comes from
the large body of concordant radiometric age measurements on the rocks
themselves. Some examples of these data will be presented later.

<font size=-1>From&nbsp; Radiometric Dating, Geologic Time, and The Age
of the Earth: A Reply to "Scientific" Creationism by G. Brent Dalrymple,
published by the U.S. Department of the Interior (Open-File Report 86-110),
1986, pg. 11-15 .</font>
<ul>&nbsp;</ul>
Since Dalrymple wrote this paper (in 1982), there has been a discovery
that certain elements, when stripped of all of their electrons, have much
higher radioactive decay constants than are normally measured. One isotope's
(<sup>187</sup>Re) decay constant increased by a factor of one billion,
and another isotope (<sup>163</sup>Dy) that is normally stable (no measurable
radioactive decay) had a high decay rate when stripped of all its electrons.
This issue is addressed in some detail by David Ewan Kahana in his article
<a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/postmonth/mar01.html">Modifications
of Nuclear Beta Decay Rates From the thread "Decay Rates"</a> . Without
going into the detailed physics that Dr. Kahana discusses, there are a
couple of problems with the argument that decay rates for minerals that
are actually dated could be affected by this process. The first is that
the extreme conditions required for stripping all the electrons from all
atoms could not exist for a solid earth. The second is that most radiometric
dating methods date rocks from the time they solidified (especially the
K-Ar method - argon easily escapes from molten rocks, even more easily
escapes from "rocks" in a gaseous state, and most especially from "rocks"
that are in a plasma state!).&nbsp;
<p>To address the arguments that creationists sometimes make that the decay
constants may have been different in the past, see&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~lindsay/creation/constant_evidence.html">Evidence
about Constants Being the Same in the Distant Past</a> by Don Lindsay.
<p><a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/isochron-dating.html">Isochron
Dating</a> by Chris Stassen demonstrates how this method carefully checks
against both initial parent / daughter isotope concentrations and the possible
loss or gain of these isotopes. Also, take a look at Stassen's section
titled <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-age-of-earth.html#failed">Claims
that the assumptions of a method may be violated</a> from his essay <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-age-of-earth.html">The

Radiometric dates</a> by Dr. Joseph Meert, a geologist at the University
of Florida, demonstrates that when many different tests are performed on
the same samples, the tests routinely give the same age for the sample.
See <a href="http://www.gate.net/~rwms/AgeEarth.html">Radiometric Dating</a>
for many more examples of different dating techniques giving the same age
for sample. The fact that these repeated tests using different techniques
routinely yield the same result is strong evidence that scientists are
at least sometimes capable of selecting samples that have not been contaminated
by parent or daughter elements during their life. It is very unlikely that
the initial concentration of daughter elements or loss / gain of daughter
and parent isotopes will be exactly the same for different elements having
different chemical properties. <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/geohist.html#Radiometric">Chronology
of Radiometric Dating</a> by Chris Stassen is an introduction to the history
of radiometric dating. If you read this essay, you will see how carefully
scientists have addressed the conditions required for an accurate radiometric
date.&nbsp;
<p>Geochronologists have also discovered and carefully investigated many
conditions that give erroneous dates (because they violate the conditions
or assumptions of radiometric dating). These include xenoliths in volcanic
lava, excess C12 in some marine life, lost argon due to heating events,
and excess argon in pillow lavas. Each of these cases was discovered by
scientists who were investigating the assumptions of radiometric dating,
exactly what creationists say is not done. Creationists love to point these
out as examples of the failure of radiometric dating, but in fact, they
are examples of how carefully scientists investigate their dating methods.
Each one that is discovered and accounted for increases the accuracy of
future dates. Something to keep in mind is that while scientists consider
dates that are off by 20% or even 10% to be a problem, creationists assert
that virtually all radiometric dates are off by factors of 100,000% to
roughly 100,000,000% (that's one hundred million percent)!&nbsp;
<p>Dalrymple sums up the care scientists take in utilizing radiometric
methods very nicely on pg. 17 and 19 of the article referenced above:
<ul>&nbsp;
<br>One of the primary functions of the dating specialist (sometimes called
a geochronologist) is to select the applicable method for the particular
problem to be solved, and to design the experiment in such a way that there
will be checks on the reliability of the results. As we shall see, some
of the methods have internal checks, so that the data themselves provide
good evidence of reliability or lack thereof. Sometimes, the relative sequence
of rock units, as determined independently by the geologist in the field,
can be used to check the dating results. Frequently the dating is done
on several samples of different type from the same unit, or by more than
one method. Most scientists are very hesitant to trust a single age on
a single sample as being definitive.&nbsp;</ul>

<p><br>Later, on pg.22:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>One of the principal tasks of the geochronologist is to select the
type of the material used for a dating analysis. A
<br>great deal of effort goes into the sample selection, and the choices
are made before the analysis, not on the basis of
<br>the results. Mistakes are sometimes made but are usually caught by
the various checks employed in the well-designed
<br>experiment.</ul>
Dalrymple has shown the care that scientists use in dating samples and
the effort they have put into testing the methods they use. The consistency
of dates on the same samples using completely different radiometric methods
has also been well demonstrated. Taken together, this shows that claims
that scientists do not check their assumptions and are regularly coming
up with dates that are off by a factor of over a million are pure creationist
fantasy.

missing link. Said that scientists built up a whole human ancestor from
nothing more than a single tooth. The tooth was later found to be a pig's
tooth. Nebraska man was used as evidence in the Scopes trial.&nbsp;</i></li>

<ul>&nbsp;
<br>"Nebraska Man" was never really accepted by the scientific community.
The existence of the fossil (and the erroneous claim of the discoverer
that the tooth was that of an ape or human ancestor) was announced in 1922,
and retractions were printed in Science and Nature in 1927. The tooth turned
out to belong to a peccary (a relative of pigs), an animal that does have
teeth that are somewhat similar to humans. The identification of this particular
tooth was made somewhat more difficult because it was badly worn. It is
amazing that creationists still bring this up over 70 years after the whole
thing was debunked (by other scientists, not creationists). Although a
mistake was made initially, this is a perfect example of the self correcting
nature of science that helps to show how ludicrous the creationist claims
that there is no evidence for an ancient earth or evolution are.
<p>&nbsp;It is interesting to compare and contrast a somewhat similar incident
that happened less than 20 years ago. Creationist Carl Baugh discovered
what he thought was a human tooth in Cretaceous (over 65 million years
old, in the time of the dinosaurs) deposits. Such a discovery, if true,
would have had a major impact upon the theory of evolution. However, when
Mr. Baugh's fossil tooth was examined by paleontologists, it was discovered
to be a fish tooth (although the scientists did admit that they could see
how it did bear a superficial resemblance to a human tooth). So here, we
have a case of a creationist mistaking a fish tooth for a human tooth in
the late 1980s, and being corrected by scientists, compared to scientists
mistaking a "pig" tooth for a human tooth in the 1920s and being corrected
by other scientists. Don Lindsay has a short write-up on this - see <a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~lindsay/creation/glen_rose_man.html">Glen
Rose Man</a> for further references.
<p>I would also like to note that in addition to "Nebraska Man" (which
was a mistake, not a deliberate attempt to mislead), there have been a
couple of fossils presented to the scientific community that were deliberate
hoaxes. These include Piltdown Man and the recent Archaeoraptor hoax. The
thing these two deliberate hoaxes have in common with the mistaken claims
of Nebraska Man is that their true natures were all uncovered by evolutionary
scientists, not creationists. This is additional evidence that scientists
are working very hard to discover the truth about the materials they study.
<p>Additionally, scientific evidence for or against evolution was not allowed
at the Scopes trial, nor has any credible evidence been presented that
Nebraska Man played a role in the trial. See
<a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/a_nebraska.html">Creationist
Arguments: Nebraska Man</a> and <a href="http://www.execpc.com/~jwolf/hesper2.txt">The

Man and Dishonest Creationists</a> .
<p>Finally, I would like to know about any text book that has been published
since 1930 that presents "Nebraska Man" as an example of a "missing link"
or even as evidence for evolution. To learn what scientists actually have
to say about human evolution, see Jim Foley's&nbsp; <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/">Fossil

<a NAME="without_god"></a><i>Evolutionists are forced to figure out how
how things work without God.</i>&nbsp;</li>

<ul>&nbsp;
<br>Here creationists are confusing methodological naturalism with philosophical
naturalism. Philosophical naturalism (sometimes called metaphysical naturalism)
is the belief that the natural world is all that there is - that there
are no gods, spirits, or "supernatural" events. Methodological naturalism
simply refers to the fact that scientists learn about the natural world
by studying the natural world (using the scientific method). This methodology
has proven itself to be of great use through it fantastic record of success
over the last three hundred years of its use. We have learned huge amounts
about our world and ourselves through the scientific method and its reliance
upon methodological naturalism. Now, just because a scientist uses the
scientific method does not mean that she has to adhere to philosophical
naturalism. This is certainly demonstrated by the fact that there are many
scientists who are Christians (as well as many scientists who are members
of various other religions that preclude philosophical naturalism.&nbsp;
<p>I like to demonstrate the difference between philosophical naturalism
and methodological naturalism with the following example. If a child asks
"Why is grass green?", a parent could reply to the child "Because God made
it that way." This, of course, is a perfectly valid answer if that is the
religious belief of the parent. However, another alternative would be to
tell the child that grass is green because it contains the green pigment
chlorophyll that is used to convert sunlight energy into the energy of
food. You could go on to mention that chlorophyll is green because it absorbs
most colors of light, but it reflects rather than absorbs a particular
shade of green. You might even be able to discuss how the shape of the
chlorophyll molecule influences light waves to reflect the green light,
etc., etc., etc. The point is, these explanations are just as valid for
the scientist who does believe in God as they are for the non-theist. That
is the point of methodological naturalism - that we can learn much about
the world by studying it as if nature was all there that was, whether we
really believe that or not. Scientists (many of whom are Christians or
practice other religions) are not <b>forced</b> to figure out how things
work without God, they do so because it is the model that has worked best
to add to our understanding of how the world works. Whether or not one
believes that God is behind it all is a matter of religious belief, entirely
separate from whether or not one uses methodological naturalism to learn
as much as possible about how things work.

the light of stars on earth the moment it was created.</i>&nbsp;</li>

<blockquote>The problem with this argument is that it could be used to
invalidate any evidence. "Last Thursdayism" is the proposal that we were
all created last Thursday with intact memories of our life prior to last
Thursday. Such a claim is untestable and hence irrefutable. Some have also
objected that the "appearance of age" argument makes God out to be a liar.
Remember that when we look in space, we aren't just seeing twinkling points
of light, we are seeing events that happened in the distant past. A good
example of such an event is the supernova SN 1987a, a star that went supernova
in 1987. Scientists have been studying this event for nearly 15 years,
watching the explosion proceed from the star and out into space where it
caused a ring of gas surrounding the star to start glowing about a year
after the initial supernova event. SN 1987 is about 160,000 light years
away. If the creationist explanation were true, then none of these events
are real, but rather are "lies" from God. The simple fact is that when
we see events from hundreds of thousands of light years away, those events
must have happened hundreds of thousands of years ago. The fact that creationists
are willing to use this argument to explain away the simple concept of
the speed of light tells us how desperate they are to maintain their believe
in a young earth, regardless of any evidence that can be presented.&nbsp;

<p>Supporters of "scientific" creationism frequently criticize dendrochronology,
arguing that two or more growth rings may occur in any given year and that
this precludes an accurate annual count (for example, Morris, 1974). Their
objections ar fallacious. Not all trees growing in all climates are suitable
for tree ring dating. Certain species of juniper, for example, are notorious
for producing multiple rings. Likewise, many woody trees in tropical climates
can produce&nbsp; several growth rings in one year. For these reasons,
dendrochronologists use only about three dozen genera of trees and only
in particular geographic areas. In addition, the annual counts are meticulously
verified by crossdating using ring matching in multiple radii, trees, and
tree
stands. Tree ring dating is complicated but very reliable when properly
done (Fritts, 1972, 1976).
