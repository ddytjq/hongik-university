Welcome to the Scale of the Universe Debate 1996 <p>

How big is the Universe?  How old?  In this century observational astronomy has produced a revolution in 
human thought about the nature of the cosmos.  This revolution was fueled by issues laid out <i> in this 
very auditorium </i> in the 1920 "Scale of the Universe" debate between Harlow Shapley and Heber 
Curtis.  Subsequently came the discovery of an expanding Universe filled with galaxies.  In this profound 
realization, Edwin Hubble played a major role, coining the constant that bears his name. <p>

How big is the universe?  At the root of this question now lies the Big Bang and how one converts from 
easily measured expansion speed to hard-to-measure distance.  Hubble's constant directly facilitates this 
conversion, giving a scale to the Universe.  There is disagreement in the astronomical community, 
however, over the value of the Hubble constant. <p>

Today, Gustav Tammann and Sidney van den Bergh will champion two significantly different values of the 
Hubble constant in a "Scale of the Universe 1996" debate.  This debate is not only about the latest results 
from astronomy.  On display today is the nature of scientific disagreement, how scientists think, and how 
extremely difficult it is to understand and defeat systematic errors in scientific analysis. <p>

Last year's astronomical debate program, also held in this historic auditorium, marked the 75th anniversary 
of the Curtis-Shapley debate.  We are pleased to welcome you to this second in the series of the "Turn of 
the Millennium Astronomical Debates."  We intend these public programs to highlight important problems 
in astrophysics that exist at the end of the second millennium.  We sincerely hope that you find today's 
debate enjoyable, educational, and entertaining. <p>

<center> Who's Who </center>

<p>

<b> Owen Gingerich: </b> Dr. Gingerich is a senior astronomer at the Smithsonian Astrophysical 
Observatory and Professor of Astronomy and the History of Science at Harvard University.  He served as 
vice president of the American Philosophical Society as well as chairman of the US National Committee of 
the International Astronomical Union.  In the past two decades he has become a leading authority on 
Kepler and Copernicus.  <p>

<b> Virginia Trimble: </b> Dr. Trimble is Professor of Astronomy at the University of California at Irvine 
and Visiting Professor at the University of Maryland in College Park.  She received the 1986 National 
Academy of Sciences Award for scientific reviewing and currently is Editor for Comments on 
Astrophysics and Associate Editor for The Astrophysical Journal.  She is the president of the International 
Astronomical Union Commission on Galaxies. <p>

<b> John Bahcall: </b> Dr. Bahcall is a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New 
Jersey, and a visiting lecturer with the rank of professor at Princeton University.  Active in research across 
the spectrum of astrophysics, he chaired the National Academy of Sciences and National Research 
Council's committee to survey and prioritize the most important programs in astronomy and astrophysics 
in the 1990s. <p>

<b> Sidney van den Bergh: </b> Dr. van den Bergh is a senior scientist and former director of the 
Dominion Astrophysical Observatory as well as adjunct professor of the University of Victoria, Canada.  
With over 500 publications, his research interests include stellar populations, supernovae and their 
remnants, the extragalactic distance scale and cosmology.  He is a recipient of the Canadian National 
Research Council's Order of Canada. <p>

<b> Gustav Tammann: </b> Dr. Tammann is director of the Astronomical Institute of the University of 
Basel, Switzerland, European Space Agency Member of the Space Telescope Advisory Team and Member 
of  Council of the European Southern Observatory.  His research interests include supernovae and the 
extragalactic distance scale.   Professor Tammann is a former President of the International Astronomical 
Union Commission on Galaxies.
