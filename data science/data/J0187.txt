									<h3><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#0000cd" size="4"><b>THE DETAILS MAKE THE DIFFERENCE</b></font></h3>
								</center>
								<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#0000cd"><b>Focus</b></font></p>
								<ul>
									<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Only Motorsports candidates.</b> Candidates who list their resumes on JobsInMotorsports.com are specifically interested in working in the motorsports field. In most cases, they have experience in the motorsports industry or, at least, skills directly applicable to specific racing jobs.</font>
									<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>The right skills</b>. Motorsports job titles pinpoint the skills of candidates to the ones Motorsports employers need and make your searches more effective.</font>
									<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Beyond the resume.</b> Candidates may fill in a questionnaire designed to give you, the potential employer, a much better sense of their personality, character and work ethic than is offered by a traditional resume. Motorsports is a field where chemistry and teamwork are vital. This information can help you make better decisions on who best suits your organization.</font>
									<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Candidates given realistic direction.</b> Resources provided for candidates are designed to steer them into taking realistic approaches to their motorsports careers. They are provided direction both in terms of getting appropriate training and experience as well as identifying the positions and organizations they are realistically qualified for.</font>
								</ul>
								<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#0000cd"><b>Speed &amp; Time Savings</b></font></p>
								<ul>
									<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Conduct searches offline.</b> Resume Forwarding means that the most interested candidates' resumes are on your computer (<a href="resfor.html">click here for more on Resume Forwarding</a>). No waiting for pages to load, no waiting for the online database to conduct a search and upload the results pages one-by-one, no busy times when access is slower. Where this can really come in handy is if you are on the road without access to the Internet and find out that one of your team members can't make it.</font>
									<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>One convenient file format.</b> Resumes are sent to you as text emails. They take less space, can be searched in a few seconds with your email program and you don't have to open different programs to read them (or worry about if you can open them at all). </font>
									<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>One consistent resume format.</b> Standardized formatting, contents and structure of the resume emails make them easier and faster to interpret and determine if the candidate is a good prospect for the position. You can go right to what you consider the most important information. It is always in the same place.</font>
									<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Less to read through</b>. Resumes are abbreviation to the most salient information. Once you have identified the candidates that interest you, use the Candidate ID's of the only the best prospects to view their full resume information on-line or have it sent to you by email.</font>
								</ul>
								<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#0000cd"><b>Convenience</b></font></p>
								<ul>
									<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Scan.</b> By keeping the forwarded email to the most salient information organized in a consistent, easy to read format, we make it practical for you to quickly skim each email forwarded to you. Do you want to able to grab that superstar even when you don't have an immediate opening? Here's a convenient way to keep tabs on who's available.</font>
									<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Or file.</b> Don't want to read resumes until you are ready to hire? Email programs let you direct incoming emails into specific mailboxes. You can direct all of the forwarded emails in one mailbox and never look at them until you have a position to fill. You only need to read the resumes that come up when you have an opening and search that mailbox. </font>
									<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Searching is simple.</b> Email programs have simple, easy search tools. Because the information is all in the email body, you don't have to open another program or deal with different file types. Or, read through paper files mailed or faxed to you. Instead, you can quickly select out resumes that contain appropriate search terms.</font>
									<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Internet not necessary.</b> Resume information is stored both on your computer's hard drive and on the Internet. The information on your hard drive is easier and quicker to access and search and is always available even if your don't have Internet access (while you are at a track or on the road, perhaps). Should you be away from your work computer, the same information is available on the website.</font>
									<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Work in one program.</b> All you need is your email program. Text files with no attachments mean you avoid difficulties with or time lost opening different kinds of word processor files.</font>
									<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Efficient filing and storage.</b> Text email files take very little hard disk space, especially when compressed. Of course, they don't take up any space in your file cabinet. Plus, your email program allows you to quickly sort resumes into different categories if you want to file them in separate mailboxes.</font>
									<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Print only when you need to.</b> As emails you can read resumes at your convenience without going to the Internet and only print hard copies when you need to. You save time, paper and ink.</font>
