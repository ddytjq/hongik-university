      <P><CENTER><I>Forget the Snap-On Tools truck; it's never there
      when you need it.<BR>
      Besides, there are only ten things in this world you need to
      fix any car, any place, any time.</I></CENTER></P>

      <DL>
        <DD><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">1. DUCT TAPE:</FONT></B> Not just
        a tool, a veritable Swiss Army knife in stickum and plastic.
        It's safety wire, body material, radiator hose, upholstery, insulation,
        tow rope, and more in one easy-to-carry package. Sure, there's
        a prejudice surrounding duct tape in concourse competitions,
        but in the real world everything from LeMans - winning Porsches
        to Atlas rockets - uses it by the yard. The only thing that can
        get you out of more scrapes is a quarter and a phone booth.
        <DD>&nbsp;
        <DD><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">2. VICE-GRIPS: </FONT></B>Equally
        adept as a wrench, hammer, pliers, baling wire twister, breaker-off
        of frozen bolts, and wiggle-it-till-it-falls-off tool. The heavy
        artillery of your toolbox, Vice Grips are the only tool designed
        expressly to fix things screwed up beyond repair.
        <DD>&nbsp;
        <DD><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">3. SPRAY LUBRICANTS:</FONT></B>
        A considerably cheaper alternative to new doors, alternators,
        and other squeaky items. Slicker than pig phlegm. Repeated soakings
        of WD-40 will allow the main hull bolts of the Andrea Dora to
        be removed by hand. Strangely enough, an integral part of these
        sprays is the infamous little red tube that flies out of the
        nozzle if you look at it cross-eyed, one of the ten worst tools
        of all time.
        <DD>&nbsp;
        <DD><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">4. MARGARINE TUBS WITH CLEAR LIDS:</FONT></B>
        If you spend all your time under the hood looking for a frendle
        pin that caromed off the peedle valve when you knocked both off
        the air cleaner, it's because you eat butter. Real mechanics
        consume pounds of tasteless vegetable oil replicas, just so they
        can use the empty tubs for parts containers afterward. (Some,
        of course, chuck the butter-colored goo altogether or use it
        to repack wheel bearings.) Unlike air cleaners and radiator lips,
        margarine tubs aren't connected by a time/space wormhole to the
        Parallel Universe of Lost Frendle Pins.
        <DD>&nbsp;
        <DD><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">5. BIG ROCK AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD:</FONT></B>
        Block up a tire. Smack corroded battery terminals. Pound out
        a dent. Bop nosy know-it-all types on the noodle. Scientists
        have yet to develop a hammer that packs the raw banging power
        of granite or limestone.
        <DD>&nbsp;
        <DD><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">6. PLASTIC ZIP TIES:</FONT></B>
        After twenty years of lashing down stray hoses and wired with
        old bread ties, some genius brought a slightly slicked up version
        to the auto parts market. Fifteen zip ties can transform a hulking
        mass of amateur-quality rewiring from a working model of the
        Brazilian rain forest into something remotely resembling a wiring
        harness. Of course, it works both ways. When buying used cars,
        subtract $100.00 for each zip tie under the hood.
        <DD>&nbsp;
        <DD><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">7. RIDICULOUSLY LARGE STANDARD SCREWDRIVER
        WITH LIFETIME GUARANTEE:</FONT></B> Admit it. There's nothing
        better for prying, chiseling, lifting, breaking, splitting, or
        mutilating than a huge flat-bladed screwdriver, particularly
        when wielded with gusto and a big hammer. This is also the tool
        of choice for oil filters so insanely located they can only be
        removed by driving a stake in one side and out the other. If
        you break the screwdriver - and you will, just like Dad or your
        shop teacher said - who cares? It's guaranteed.
        <DD>&nbsp;
        <DD><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">8. BAILING WIRE:</FONT></B> Commonly
        known as MG muffler brackets, bailing wire holds anything that's
        too hot for tape or ties. Like duct tape, it's not recommended
        for concourse contenders since it works so well you'll never
        replace it with the right thing again. Bailing wire is a sentimental
        favorite in some circles, particularly with MG, Triumph, and
        flathead Ford set.
        <DD>&nbsp;
        <DD><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">9. BONKING STICK:</FONT></B> This
        monstrous tuning fork with devilishly pointy ends is technically
        known as a tie-rod- end separator, but how often do you separate
        tie-ends? Once every decade, if you're lucky. Other than medieval
        combat, its real use is the all purpose application of undue
        force, not unlike that of the huge flat-bladed screwdriver. Nature
        doesn't know the bent metal panel or frozen exhaust pipe that
        can stand up to a good bonking stick. (Can also be used to separate
        tie-rod ends in a pinch, of course, but does a lousy job of it).

        <B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">AND A PHONE BOOTH:</FONT></B> (See #1
        above.) <I>{Okay so most of you have a cellular phone....but
        you get the idea.}</I>
