<H2>What The Press Is Saying About Us:</H2>



<P><I> "Subaru/IMBA's Trail Care Crew has been a huge success. Word from the road
after the first full year of involvement by the Crew has brought news of several
trails opened and many old trails renovated." </I></P>

<ul> <P> <U>Two Cars & A Mission - Getting in touch with IMBA's Trail Care
Crew</U> - appeared in <I>Mountain Bike Action</I>. </P> </ul>


<P> <I>"Zero speeding tickets. Zero Subaru flat tires. One collision between racked
bikes and low branch. One broken collarbone. One case of emergency-room-level
poison oak. One stolen electronic organizer. One incident of locked-in car keys.
Two IMBA T-shirts. Two windbreakers. Four jerseys. Six pairs of jeans, shorts and
riding shorts. Nine flat bicycle tires. Twelve pair of underwear. Twenty-four
pair of socks. Forty-three boxes of Ho-Ho's. Two-hundred miles a day.
Three-thousand-one-hundred-eighty-three volunteer hours."</I> </P>


<ul> <P> <U>TCC Journal Entry, June 30</U> - appeared in <I>Mountain Bike</I>
magazine. </P>
</ul>


<P> <I>"... They possess none of the permanence they give the trails. They have no
regular mail delivery. They never forget to turn the porch light off. They have
escaped."</I> </P>

<P> <I>"They live the dream we dream, traveling and riding and getting paid for
both. IMBA's Trail Care Crew has done it right, the way it should be, a way as
rangy as the entire U.S. and as intimate as the front seat of a Subaru Outback."</I>
</P>


<ul> <P> <U>Tomorrow Is Another Trail</U> - appeared in <I>Mountain Bike</I>
magazine. </P> </ul>



<H2>What You're Saying About Us:</H2>


<P>
<I>"Subaru of America should be commended for helping to create an effective active
trails resource. Many companies donate money for environmental causes, but very
few actually participate in initiating change in a positive direction. The
Subaru/IMBA crew came along (to East Hampton) just when they could do the most
good. I think it is so remarkable and wonderful that something like this Subaru
IMBA partnership exists."</I>
</P>

<P> <ul> --Ken Kindler, <BR>East Hampton, NY </P></ul>

<P> <I>"Just wanted to express my appreciation for the Trail Care Crew's
participation in our National Trails Day work projects.  They were awesome.  The
work the TCC's are doing is so important.  They did a great job of emphasizing
the importance of trail design and good drainage.  As a land manager, I really
appreciate this message coming from the user group rather than just the agency.
The momentum within the community is now building.  THANKS!" </I> </P>

<P> <UL>--Linda Merigliano, Wilderness, Trails, Recreation Planner<BR>
Bridger-Teton National Forest,  Jackson, WY</ul> </P>

<P> <I>"I just wanted to let you know that it was great to have Kathy and Joey
stop by Rapid City. They did an excellent job of showing us how to build and
maintain trails. They're also super cool people and definitely an inspiration. If
they or another TCC is able to stop by next year we'd love to have them. Thanks
again and keep up the outstanding work." </I> </P>

<P> <UL>--James Loverich<BR> Rapid City, SD </ul> </P>

<P> <I>"All of us want to work on our local trails, but very few of us have the
time or energy to organize it. Sending out the Trail Care Crew just motivates
everyone to get out and do it." </I> </P>

<P> <UL>--Tennessee mountain biker </ul> </P>

<P> <I>"We had a great trails day with Joey and Kathy, your Trail Care Crew 2. We
learned a lot of good techniques used to keep trails sustainable without a lot of
seasonal maintenance." The highlight was learning how to build "rolling grade
dips." </I> </P>

<P> <UL>--George Putnam<BR> Jackson, WY </ul> </P>

<P> <I>"IMBA's Trail Care Crew is an excellent example of a partnership between
public, private, and non-profit organizations coming together for a common goal."
</I> </P>

<P> <UL>--Oregon Bureau of Land Management recreation planner </ul> </P>

<P> <I>"The Crew handled every question and concern with expert skill. They were
authoritative without being sanctimonious. They worked miracles." </I> </P>

<P> <UL>--Indiana Bicycle Coalition member </ul> </P>

<P> <I>"I worked with you Trail Care Crew 3 (Jen & Rich). They were great, they
really knew their stuff and helped a lot. New Jersey has had its problems with
trails and parks closing, and it's was great to see the IMBA help "hands on"! It
gave us a burst of energy and pushed us to work even harder on helping the sport.
Thanks!" </I> </P>

<P> <UL>--Mike Lukowiak<BR> New Jersey </ul> </P>

<P> <I>"In a few minutes of conversation with our local Forest Service officials,
Joey, and his IMBA Trail Care Crew credentials did in a few minutes what local
mountain bikers have spent hours trying to accomplish - he opened their eyes to
the possibilities of (mountain bikers) doing real trail improvements. Our local
land managers now realize there is much to learn from the IMBA Trail Care Crew
and are anxious to have them back for a longer visit. I believe we have a great
opportunity to improve the quality of trails and also the mountain bike
community's prestige both in Santa Barbara and throughout the California south
coast." </I> </P>

<P> <UL>--Chuck Anderson<BR> Santa Barbara, CA </ul> </P>


<P> <I>"We met Rich and Jen on Saturday and they gave us some tips on different
techniques which I think will prove to be very helpful in the future. Besides
being pretty savvy about trail work Rich and Jen are excellent advocates of our
sport. We are excited to be apart of IMBA." </I> </P>

<P> <UL>--Bill Snure<BR> Amarillo, TX </ul> </P>

<P> <I>"Thanks to everyone and to Rich and Jen Edwards of the IMBA Trail Care
Crew and Jon Alegranti of IMBA who participated in the trail work session on
National Trails Day, June 3rd. Several projects were performed to fix damage
created by Hurricane Floyd. Jen and Rich also paid a visit to Pennypack Park
where they advised the group on how to do a major re-route around a problematic
area of the trail. Several members of the Friends of Pennypack (who regularly
perform trail maintenance in the park) were very impressed and thankful to the
Trail Care Crew for the education and for the visit to the park." </I> </P>

<P> <UL>--Wendy Troester<BR> Philadelphia, PA </ul> </P>

<P> <I>"I just want to say what an awesome day we had doing trail work with
IMBA's Trail Care Crew today! I am so totally overwhelmed with the amount and
quality of work we accomplished! I learned a lot from Jen and Rich, as I'm sure
we all did! We have a lot of work yet ahead of us before the trail is complete,
but Jen and Rich really got us rolling! It will be awhile before I come down off
this high!" </I> </P>

<P> <UL>--Brian Smith<BR> Hartford, CT </ul> </P>

<P> <I>"A Trail Care Crew visit s an absolute must for anyone or group interested
in building and maintaining trails properly.  I and everyone at Oklahoma
Earthbike Fellowship want to thank IMBA for such a great program." </I> </P>

<P> <UL>--Charles Duke<BR> Oklahoma City, OK</ul> </P>

<P> <I>"Just wanted to let you know that your IMBA programs are having a positive
impact on South Carolina trails, volunteers, trail users and land managers." </I>
</P>

<P> <UL>--Jim Schmid, State Trails Coordinator<BR> Columbia, SC</ul> </P>

<P> <I>"The Subaru/IMBA Trail Care Crew visit to Greensfelder Park was very
successful by all accounts.  The TCC did an outstanding job.  They are great
representatives of the sport.  Thanks again." </I> </P>

<P> <UL>--John Donjoian<BR> St. Louis, MO</ul> </P>

<P> <I>"The IMBA folks are certainly knowledgeable about trail-building, and
there are a lot of locals who are motivated to do the hard work involved in
making good trails." </I> </P>

<P> <UL>--Mike Rickets, Ranger, Rogue River National Forest, <BR> Ashland,
OR</ul> </P>


<P> <I>"I want to let you know how much we appreciated the Trail Care Crew's
three day visit.  It was most beneficial to myself and  the rest of the mountain
bikers and land managers who attended his two slide shows and the three days of
field review of the single track trails in Susanville Ranch Park." </I> </P>

<P> <UL>--John Shoun<BR> Susanville, CA</ul> </P>

<P> <I>"Thanks so much for the Subura/IMBA Trail Crew visit last month to the
Reno-Tahoe area.  Joey did a fantastic job in dealing with our local land
managers,  leaving them impressed by IMBA's philosophy and trail expertise." </I>
</P>

<P> <UL>--Dale Beesmer<BR> Reno, NV</ul> </P>
