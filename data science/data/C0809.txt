<P><i>It's never too early to start your Christmas shopping, says Samantha Claws</i></font>

<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">

<p><b>Christmas shopping in October is not as mad an idea as you are currently screaming at the screen. I too once believed that it wasn't the sanest thing to do. But last year it dawned on me that my main reason for not doing so - <b>lack of dosh</b> - was something that didn't really resolve itself magically come December 1st.  Think about it: surely it makes sense to start exercising your overdraft limit/credit card now, in order for it to be 100% match fit come the festive season proper?</b></p>

<p>Another reason for starting your Christmas shopping early is that it helps you keep to the <b>'if you see it, buy it'</b> maxim, which is key to successful present buying. After all, how many times on previous Yuletide shopping expeditions have you said to yourself: "Now that would do very well for Uncle Bill, but first I must go to ten other shops to check out what they offer, and if they do it in a different colour." Only to return later to an empty shelf.</p>

<p>Shopping on the internet, of course, offers lots of other advantages too: no crowds, no heavy bags, no closing times. So where to start?</p>

<p>Firstly it's essential that you try and get into the holiday mood. So <b>tie a piece of tinsel round your head</b> and log onto <A HREF="http://www.christmas.com" TARGET="new">www.christmas.com</A>. As well as providing you with invaluable festive recipes from around the world (pistachio and cranberry cookies anyone?) you can also click onto their <b>Christmas Countdown</b> where you can see every precious second between now and the big day ticking away. With that impetus behind you, you should now start surfing with piece of plastic to hand. </p>

<p>Now remember just because you're on the net, it doesn't mean you have to go and shop at unknown quantities with weird and wonderful names. If you feel comfortable with the likes of <A HREF="http://www.marksandspencer.com" TARGET="new">Marks & Spencer</A>, <A HREF="http://www.boots.co.uk" TARGET="new">Boots</A> and <A HREF="http://www.debenhams.com" TARGET="new">Debenhams</A>, then visit their online stores. Other high street names with e-stores are <A HREF="http://www.next.co.uk" TARGET="new">Next</A>, <A HREF="http://www.principles.co.uk" TARGET="new">Principles</A>, <A HREF="http://www.burtonmenswear.co.uk" TARGET="new">Burtons</A> and <A HREF="http://www.dorothyperkins.co.uk" TARGET="new">Dorothy Perkins</A>. An easy way to find many of the big retailing names is to check out the 'Shopping' site on whichever search engine you favour.</p>

<p>But as you're on the net with time on your side, why not check out some of the more unusual gift sites, such as <A HREF="http://www.iwantoneofthose.com" TARGET="new">www.iwantoneofthose.com</A>, <A HREF="http://www.alt-gifts.com" TARGET="new">www.alt-gifts.com</A> and <A HREF="http://www.gizmoandwidget.com" TARGET="new">www.gizmoandwidget.com</A>. </p>

<p>By being a little more adventurous you might be able to come up with some cyber twists on some of the more mundane Christmas fare. For example, at <A HREF="http://www.britsox.co.uk" TARGET="new">www.britsox.co.uk</A> you can subscribe to a sock package whereby the receiver gets six pairs of high quality socks, but not all at the same time. Two pairs are mailed three times a year so that the receiver never has to remember to buy new socks. </p>

<p><b>Merry Christmas!</b></p>
