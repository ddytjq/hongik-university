Peripheral receptors:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">There are three different categories (modalities)of the somatosensory system.  The first, <B>discriminative touch</B>,is the perception of pressure, vibration, and texture.  This systemrelies on four different receptors in the skin.  They are:<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">1) Meissner's corpuscles<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">2) Pacinian corpuscles<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">3) Merkel's disks<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">4) Ruffini endings<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The first two are considered <B>rapidly adapting</B>(they quickly stop firing in response to a constant stimulus)and the second two are considered <B>slowly adapting</B> (theydo not stop firing).  To put this into an example, if you layyour pen down in your palm, the Meissner's and Pacinian corpuscleswill fire rapidly as it first touches down, to let you know somethinghas landed.  If the pen lays still, they will stop firing almostright away.  The Merkel's and Ruffini endings, however, will continueto fire to let you know that something is still there.  <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The <B>pain and temperature</B> system does not havespecialized receptor organs.  Instead, it uses <B>free nerve endings</B>throughout skin, muscle, bone, and connective tissue to perceivechanges in temperature and pain peptides.  Although pain willresult from damage to a free nerve ending, in reality most painis a result of substances released by damaged tissues: <B>prostaglandins</B>,<B>histamine</B>, and <B>substance P</B>.  The free nerve endinghas receptors for these substances and lets you know (stridently)when tissue has been damaged.  <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The third modality, <B>proprioceptive</B> sensation,relies on receptors in muscles and joints.  The <B>muscle spindle</B>is the major stretch receptor within muscles, and just like thecutaneous receptors, it has a rapidly-adapting and slowly-adaptingcomponent.  (For more on the muscle spindle see &quot;Spinal motorstructures&quot;.)  There are also <B>Golgi tendon organs</B>and <B>joint afferents</B> to monitor stresses and forces at thetendons and joints.  <BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>B. Axon diameters:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Sensory axons can be classified according to diameterand therefore conduction velocity.  The largest and fastest axonsare called <B>A</B></FONT><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Symbol">a</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">,and include some of the proprioceptive neurons, such as the stretchreceptor. (Note: there is a separate, Roman numeral classificationused for the proprioceptive axons, which will be covered in thesection on muscle spindles.)  The second largest group is called<B>A</B></FONT><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Symbol">b</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">,which includes all of the discriminative touch receptors.  Painand temperature include the third and fourth groups, <B>A</B></FONT><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Symbol">d</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">and <B>C fibers</B>.  There are two subtypes of pain.  &quot;Fastpain&quot;, carried by the A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Symbol">d</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">fibers, is the instantaneous pain that makes your arm jerk backbefore you even realized you were burned.  It is sharp and piercingand over quickly.  &quot;Slow pain&quot; is carried by C fibers. C fibers are not only small, they are unmyelinated (the onlysensory axons without myelin), so their conduction velocity isquite slow.  Slow pain is primarily mediated by those tissue-damagepeptides listed above, and can go on indefinitely.  It is distressing,it can be dull and aching, and it does not trigger withdrawalreflexes like the fast pain.  A perfect example of slow pain iswhen you stub your toe on the coffee table.  You feel the joltof impact (proprioception and Pacinian corpuscles), and you haveapproximately a heartbeat to think, &quot;This is really goingto hurt.&quot;  That heartbeat is the C-fiber travel time fromyour toe to your brain.  When the signal hits, the pain is severeand lasts for quite a while.  It is, however, a nice demonstrationof the relative conduction velocities of A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Symbol">a</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">and C fibers.  <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">As the dorsal root enters the cord (all sensory informationcomes in via the dorsal root, and all sensory cell bodies arein the dorsal root ganglion), the fibers sort themselves out bydiameter.  The largest fibers enter the cord most medially, andthe smallest fibers enter most laterally.  From there, the threemodalities take very different paths, so we must look at eachone separately.  <BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>C.  The discriminative touch system:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The posterior columns should be a review from the&quot;Basic somatosensory&quot; section.  Here is a schematicof the pathway, to remind you:<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="body1.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The key points are that the primary afferents ascendall the way to the medulla, on the ispilateral side of the cord,in the <B>posterior columns</B>.  The secondary afferents crossin the medulla and ascend as the <B>medial lemniscus</B>.  Inthe thalamus they synapse in the <B>VPL</B> (the ventroposteriorlateral nucleus) and finally ascend to cortex.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>D.  The pain and temperature system:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">This system shares one major rule with the discriminativetouch system: <U>primary afferents synapse ipsilaterally, thensecondary afferents cross</U>.  SYNAPSE, then CROSS.  The crossingsjust occur at different levels.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Pain afferents (all of the following applies to temperatureas well) enter the cord laterally, due to their small size, andsynapse more or less immediately.  &quot;More or less&quot;, becausethey actually can travel one or two segments up or down the cordbefore synapsing.  <B>Lissauer's tract</B> is the tract carryingthese migrating axons, but they are only in the tract for a shorttime.  Within one or two levels, they enter the dorsal horn andsynapse.</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="body2.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The dorsal horn is a multi-layered structure.  Thethin outermost layer is called the <B>posterior marginalis</B>layer.  The wide pale second layer is called the <B>substantiagelatinosa</B>, and the layer deep to that is called the <B>nucleusproprius</B>.  The layers continue into the ventral horn, butthese are the three significant ones for now.  <BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="body3.gif"><BR><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The two types of pain fibers enter different layersof the dorsal horn.  A</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Symbol">d</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">fibers enter the posterior marginalis and the nucleus proprius,and synapse on a second set of neurons.  These are the secondaryafferents (purple, below) which will carry the signal to the thalamus. The secondary afferents from both layers cross to the oppositeside of the spinal cord and ascend in a tract called (logically)the <B>spinothalamic tract</B>.  Tracts are always labeled frombeginning to end.</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="body4.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The C fibers enter the substantia gelatinosa andsynapse, but they do not synapse on secondary afferents.  Insteadthey synapse on <B>interneurons</B> - neurons which do not projectout of the immediate area.  The interneurons must carry the signalto the secondary afferents in either the posterior marginalisor the nucleus proprius.<BR><BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="body5.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The spinothalamic tract ascends the entire lengthof the cord as shown above, and the entire brainstem, stayingin about the same location all the way up.  Below are representativeslides showing the tract in the medulla and midbrain.  Noticethat by midbrain the spinothalamic tract appears to be continuouswith the medial lemniscus.  They will enter the VPL of the thalamustogether.  <BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="body6.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The spinothalamic system enters the VPL, synapses,and is finally carried to cortex by the thalamocortical neurons. Here is a schematic of the entire pathway:</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="body7.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>E. Pain control:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">It has been recognized for centuries that <B>opium</B>and related compounds (such as <B>morphine</B>) are powerful analgesics.  Several decades ago scientists hunted down the opiate receptorwhich was responsible for the potent effects.  They then reasonedthat if there was such a receptor in the body, maybe the bodyused its own endogenous form of opium to control pain.  (It hasalso been recognized for centuries that under certain circumstances,i.e. the heat of battle, a serious wound may not cause pain.) This hypothetical compound was named &quot;<B>endorphin</B>&quot;,from endogenous-morphine.  Soon after, an entire class of peptideneurotransmitters was discovered that interacted with the opiatereceptor, and now includes endorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins. Synthetic, exogenous forms of these compounds continue to bediscovered, prescribed, and abused, and are classed under thegeneral term, &quot;narcotics&quot;.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">There are opiate receptors throughout the centralnervous system.  In the dorsal horn, they are located on the terminalsof the primary afferents, as well as on the cell bodies of thesecondary afferents.  Opiate interneurons in the spinal cord canbe activated by descending projections from the brainstem (especiallythe raphe nuclei and periaqueductal grey), and can block paintransmission at two sites.  1) They can prevent the primary afferentfrom passing on its signal by blocking neurotransmitter release,and 2) they can inhibit the secondary afferent so it does notsend the signal up the spinothalamic tract.<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="body8.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>F.  The proprioceptive system:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The proprioceptive system arises from primarily theA</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Symbol">a</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino"> afferentsentering the spinal cord.  These are the afferents from musclespindles, Golgi tendon organs, and joint receptors.  The axonstravel for a little while with the discriminative touch system,in the posterior columns.  Within a few segments, however, theproprioceptive information slips out of the dorsal white matterand synapses.  After synapsing it <U>ascends without crossing</U>to the cerebellum. <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Exactly where the axons synapse depends upon whetherthey originated in the legs or the arms.  Leg fibers enter thecord at sacral or lumbar levels, ascend to the upper lumbar segments,and synapse in a medial nucleus called <B>Clarke's nucleus</B>(or nucleus dorsalis).  The secondary afferents then enter the<B>dorsal</B> <B>spinocerebellar tract</B> on the lateral edgeof the cord.<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="body9.gif"><BR><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Fibers from the arm enter at cervical levels andascend to the caudal medulla.  Once there they synapse in a nucleuscalled the <B>external cuneate</B> (or lateral cuneate) nucleus,and the secondary axons join the leg information in the dorsalspinocerebellar tract. <BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="body10.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The spinocerebellar tract stays on the lateral marginof the brainstem all the way up the medulla.  Just before reachingthe pons, it is joined by a large projection from the <B>inferiorolive</B>.  These axons together make up the bulk of the <B>inferiorcerebellar peduncle</B>, which grows right out of the lateralmedulla and enters the cerebellum.</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="body11.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The figures above outline the course of the dorsalspinocerebellar tract.  Surely, there must be a ventral spinocerebellartract?  Naturally, there is, and it travels in approximately thesame place - the lateral margin of the spinal cord, just ventralto the dorsal spinocerebellar tract.  The two cannot be distinguishedin a normal myelin stain.  The ventral spinocerebellar tract seemsto defy the ipsilaterality of the cerebellum, because the fibersentering it in the spinal cord actually cross on their way intothe tract.  However, they (somewhat inefficiently) cross backbefore entering the cerebellum.  Therefore the cerebellum stillgets information from the ipsilateral body.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#009999>A note about generalizations:  </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">There is actually a fair amount of mixing that goeson between the tracts.  Some light touch information travels inthe spinothalamic tract, so that lesioning the dorsal columnswill not completely knock out touch and pressure sensation.  Someproprioception also travels in the dorsal columns, and followsthe medial lemniscus all the way to the cortex, so there is consciousawareness of body position and movement.  The pain and temperaturesystem, although it does ascend to somatosensory cortex, alsohas multiple targets in the brainstem and other areas. <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">For a more interactive tutorial on the anatomy, andfor stunning three dimensional pictures of these pathways, trythe Digital Anatomist in the &quot;Other links&quot; section.<BR><BR></FONT><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=#0000FF FACE="Palatino"><A HREF="http://thalamus.wustl.edu/course">RETURN TO HOME PAGE</A><BR></FONT></B></BODY></HTML>
