            resident aged 16 or over. If you cease to be eligible to hold 
            an account, you must notify us. You may not hold an account in 
            trust or under a power of attorney.</p><br>

			<p class="plaintext">As a member, the Society's Rules will apply

			<p class="biggreentext"><a name="deposits"></a>Deposits</p>
			<p class="plaintext">The minimum initial deposit for E-Saver is 
            &pound;1,000.<br><br>
            Only your initial E-Saver deposit may be by cheque. Any cheques 
            subsequently received will be returned to you. Additional deposits 
            must be transfers, either from another bank or building society 
            account, e.g. by standing order, or another account held with 
            the Yorkshire.<br><br>
            If you make your initial deposit by cheque, it will start to earn 
            interest on the first working day after 2 working days have elapsed 
            (not including the day the cheque is credited to your account). 
            Cheques credited to your account on a Saturday are treated as 
            received on the next working day (working days exclude Saturdays, 
            Sundays and Bank Holidays). Deposits by account transfer will 
            start to earn interest on the day they are credited to your account.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="biggreentext"><a name="withdrawals"></a>Withdrawals</p>
			<p class="plaintext">All withdrawals are subject to the requirement 
			to maintain a minimum balance of &pound;1,000. Funds withdrawn 
			earn interest up to, but not including, the day of withdrawal.<br><br>
			If you make your initial deposit by cheque, you will not be able 
			to withdraw against it until the first working day after 4 working 
			days (not including the day the cheque is credited to your account) 
			have elapsed. If the cheque is returned unpaid, we will deduct 
			the amount from your balance even if we have allowed withdrawals 
			against it.<br><br>
            Withdrawals will only be allowed either by:</p>
            <ul class="plaintext">
			<li>logging onto our website to transfer to your nominated bank or 
            building society account or a nominated account held with us, 
            or
			<li>use of the optional LINK cash card and Personal Identification 
            Number (PIN) at a cash machine
			</ul>
			<p class="plaintext">In the case of transfers to another account held with us, the 
			funds will normally be credited the next day. Transfers to an account at another bank or building society could take up to 5 working days to be credited.<br><br>
            We can limit the amount that may be withdrawn from your account 
            at any time without giving you notice if we reasonably consider 
            it necessary in order to protect the interests of our members 
            as a whole.</p>
			<br>
            <p class="biggreentext"><a name="jointaccounts"></a>Joint accounts</p>
			<p class="plaintext">You can hold an account with one other person. 
			All terms apply to both of you together and to each of you on 
			your own. Each of you can be held fully responsible for any liability 
			that you may have.<br><br>
			Each of you will be able to operate the account, including arranging 
			withdrawals, making changes to the account such as your address 
			or closing the account.<br><br>
			The law relating to building societies requires that whichever 
			account holder is the first named in our records is called the 
			representative joint shareholder for the purposes of membership. 
			Statutory notices such as the notice of Annual General Meeting 
			will be sent to the representative joint shareholder only. E-mails 
			concerning changes to interest rates or terms will also be issued 
			to the representative joint shareholder only.<br><br>
			For security reasons, if you open an account in your sole name, 
			you will not be able to add an additional account holder at a 
			later time, but will be able to open a new account in joint names.<br><br>
			If we are advised that there is a dispute between joint account 
			holders, e.g. in the event of separation or divorce, we will place 
			a stop on the account and any further transactions will have to 
			be authorised in writing by both holders until the dispute is 
			resolved.<br><br>
            If one of you dies, the surviving joint account holder should 
            inform us of the death and provide us with evidence. Only the 
            survivor will own and be able to operate the account.</p>

            change is needed. Changes may include the removal of or amendment 
            to terms, or the inclusion of new terms for any of the following reasons:</p>
            <ul class="plaintext">
			<li>to enable us to operate and administer your account more efficiently 
            (which includes improving our efficiency)
			<li>to give you extra benefit (including making the terms of your 
            account easier for you to understand)
			<li>to correct errors
			<li>to reflect practices and conditions in the building society and 
            banking sectors
			<li>to take account of developments in technology
			<li>to take account of a decision by a court or tribunal, or a ruling 
            by an ombudsman, regulator or similar authority as we interpret it
			<li>to take account of changes to laws, codes of practice or other 
            regulations to which we are subject
			<li>if you agree
			</ul>
			<p class="plaintext">We may also change these terms for any other valid reason where 
			we reasonably believe change is appropriate.<br><br>
            We will notify you of any change in terms:</p>
            <ul class="plaintext">
			<li>no later than 30 days after the change takes effect if it is to 
            your advantage, or
			<li>at least 30 days before the change takes effect if it is to your 
            disadvantage or it is neither to your advantage or disadvantage
			</ul>
			<p class="plaintext">We will tell you about changes to E-Saver terms by e-mail.<br><br>
            If there have been significant changes in any one year, we will 
            provide you with a copy of the new terms or a summary of the changes.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="biggreentext"><a name="charges"></a>Charges</p>
			<p class="plaintext">We may make charges for items relating to the 
			operation of your account and deduct those charges from the balance 
			in your account. The charges will reflect expenses we incur and 
			the cost of staff time and the use of our office and computer 
			facilities.<br><br>
			We can change the charges we make at any time. Changes may include 
			the removal of or amendment to existing charges or the introduction 
			of new charges. Where we introduce a new charge or increase an 
			existing charge, we will tell you at least 30 days before the 
			change takes effect by e-mail.<br><br>
            Where we remove or reduce an existing charge, we may do so immediately 
            without notice.</p><br>
			<p class="biggreentext"><a name="advisingchanges"></a>Advising you of 
            changes</p>
			<p class="plaintext">As we will advise you of changes to E-Saver 
			interest rates and terms by e-mail, it is very important that 
			you notify us if your e-mail address changes.<br><br>
            We will assume that you have received any personal notification 
            by e-mail 24 hours after sending it to you. If you do not receive 
            the notification, this will not make it invalid.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="biggreentext"><a name="changingdetails"></a>Changing your details</p>
			<p class="plaintext">If you wish to change details that we hold, 
            for example your name, address, e-mail address or the account 
            to which withdrawals are made, we will require such changes to 
            be notified in writing.</p><br>
			<p class="biggreentext"><a name="ourright"></a>Our right to close your 
            account</p>
			<p class="plaintext">We can repay to you all or part of your balance 
            at any time, without giving any reason, after giving you at least 
            30 days notice, except that we can close your account immediately 
            if we believe that you have been involved in fraudulent or serious 
            criminal behaviour or that the relationship between you and us 
            has irretrievably broken down.</p><br>
			<p class="biggreentext"><a name="interestofpersons"></a>Interest of other 
            persons</p>
			<p class="plaintext">We do not have to recognise the interest or 
            claim of any person other than the account holder(s) in respect 
            of money held in the account, nor will we be liable in any way 
            for failing to recognise such interest or claim, except as required 
            by law.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="biggreentext"><a name="unclaimed"></a>Unclaimed balances</p>
			<p class="plaintext">If for a period of 5 years you have made no 
            payment to or withdrawal from your account, and you cannot be 
            traced after reasonable enquiry, we may decide to close your account 
            and the money in it will be retained by us. If however you contact 
            us at a later date we will either open a new account for you and 
            credit that account with the amount of money in the closed account, 
            or repay the money to you, with interest at a rate which we reasonably 
            consider to be appropriate.</p><br>
			<p class="biggreentext"><a name="retention"></a>Retention and set-off</p>
			<p class="plaintext">We have the right to retain and set-off all 
            money in your account against any money you may owe to us (whether 
            under a mortgage, loan, guarantee or otherwise) which is due for 
            payment but has not been paid. We will advise you when we have 
            done this. Interest will not be paid on any money after it has 
            been used in this way.</p><br>
			<p class="biggreentext"><a name="statements"></a>Statements</p>
			<p class="plaintext">We will not send statements to you. You will

			<br>
			<p class="biggreentext"><a name="closing"></a>Closing your account</p>
			<p class="plaintext">If you decide to close your account, we will 
            add any unpaid interest to your balance and transfer the closing 
            amount either to your nominated bank or building society account 
            or to a nominated account held with us.</p><br>
			<p class="biggreentext"><a name="death"></a>Death of account holder</p>
			<p class="plaintext">If your E-Saver account is in your sole name 
            and you die, we will close the account and transfer the balance 
            to our Postal Saver account so that it may be operated by your 
            personal representatives.</p><br>
			<p class="biggreentext"><a name="interest&tax"></a>Interest &amp; tax</p>
			<p class="plaintext">Interest is calculated daily based on the balance in your account 
			and added on 31 March each year and on closure.<br><br>
            Interest is payable net of tax or, subject to the required registration, 
            gross. If you are eligible to receive interest without tax deducted, 
            you should complete the Inland Revenue form R85 and we will pay 
            your interest gross. In the case of joint accounts, we can pay 
            interest part net part gross if only one of you is eligible to 
            receive gross interest and completes form R85. Whether you receive 
            interest gross or net, it is your responsibility to declare gross 
            interest earned when making a tax return.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="biggreentext"><a name="penceinterest"></a>Pence of interest</p>
			<p class="plaintext">Once in each year where the interest payable 
            to you or credited to your account is not an exact multiple of 
            &pound;1, we will pay from the account an amount (which will not 
            exceed 99p) equal to the pence of interest to the Yorkshire Building 
            Society Charitable Foundation to be used for charitable purposes, 
            unless you (or any one of you if there is more than one account 
            holder) tell us not to. The payment will be calculated by reference 
            to the pence of your interest net of tax unless you are entitled 
            to receive interest without tax deducted in which case we shall 
            refer to the gross amount.</p><br>
			<p class="biggreentext"><a name="law"></a>Governing law</p>
			<p class="plaintext">These terms are governed by the laws of England

			<p class="biggreentext"><a name="recording"></a>Recording of telephone 
            conversations</p>
			<p class="plaintext">To improve the quality of our service, all 
            communications with us may be recorded for staff training and 
            your protection and security.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="biggreentext"><a name="link"></a>LINK card</p>
			<p class="plaintext">Either when you apply to open an account, or subsequently, you 
			may select to receive a LINK card and Personal Identification 
			Number (PIN) to enable you to withdraw cash and check your balance 
			at any LINK cash machine in the UK. For joint accounts, a LINK 
			card and PIN will be issued to each account holder.<br><br>
                Your LINK card will be sent within 5 days of your account being 
                activated or making a subsequent request, and your PIN will follow 
                4 days later. If you do not receive your card or PIN within these 
                times, you should advise us immediately.<br>
                <br>
			The LINK card remains our property at all times and the right 
			to use the card and PIN may be revoked or suspended by us without 
			notice.<br><br>
			You can change your PIN at any of our own cash machines, but you 
			should be careful to avoid numbers that others may be able to 
			guess, for example your birthday. You must never write the new 
			number down.<br><br>
                You must take care of the card and PIN to help prevent fraud and 
                to protect your account. It is essential that you notify us as 
                soon as you can if you suspect or discover that your card has 
                been lost or stolen or that someone else knows your PIN. The quickest 
                way is to telephone the 'LINKLINE' on 08459 10 11 12. Where possible, 
                you should quote your card number, i.e. the number beginning 564131 
                across the centre of your card. We may require you to confirm 
                this notification in writing within 24 hours. On receipt of this 
                notification we may, at our discretion, inform the police and 
                give them any information they may require.<br>
                <br>
			If your card is retained by a cash machine, you should contact 
			us to report this in the same way as you would a lost card.<br><br>
            You agree:</p>
            <ul class="plaintext">
			<li>not to let anyone else use your card and PIN
			<li>to learn your PIN and destroy the notification of your PIN as 
            soon as you receive it
			<li>to take reasonable steps to keep your card safe and your PIN secret 
            at all times
			<li>not to write down or record your PIN
			</ul>
			<p class="plaintext">It is important that you comply with these conditions to ensure 
			there are no unauthorised transactions on your account. You will 
			be liable for all losses if you have acted fraudulently. You may 
			be liable for all losses if you have acted without reasonable care, 
			which may include failure to comply with the above requirements 
			if such failure causes those losses.<br><br>
			You cannot withdraw cash from a LINK machine if your balance would 
			fall below the minimum balance required by your account as a result 
			of that withdrawal.<br><br>
			We do not make any charges for the use of your LINK card at any 
			LINK machine. However, it is possible that the institution providing 
			the machine may make a charge. You will be advised of this during 
			the transaction and will be able to cancel it if you do not wish 
			to pay this charge.</p><br>
