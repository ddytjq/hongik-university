<span class="textbd">Data Wizards and the Clear Sky Clocks
</span>
<span class="text">
<br>
</p>
<p>
Today we are talking to two very 'Data Oriented' Gentlemen: 
Allan Rahill, a most avid and accurate "Forecaster of Clouds and Clear Skies", particularly for amateur astronomers. Allan collects the Data for Attilla Danko's Greatest Invention: <b>The Clear Sky Clock</b> which puts Allan's data to task in forecasting sky transparency for specific observing sites.
</p>
<p> 
These gentlemen do this in their own free time, willingly and totally gratis for the Amateur Astronomer. I have personally tested the clock, which Attilla prepared for several areas, and so far, it has been very accurate in forecasting clear skies.
</p>
<p>
Notice to non-American/Canadian readers: the clear sky clock unfortunately is currently unavailable to observers outside the Americas. Hopefully Mr. Allan Rahill will find a way to "psych out" the weather gods and soon bring it to your area.  For the moment, it is solely
available to the Americas. - LL
</p>
<p>
Mr. Attila Danko, "Clear Clock Wizard", is originally from Hungary, transplanted to Ottawa, Canada.
Mr. Allan Rahill: "The Data Master", is a French Canadian living in Montreal, Canada, about 2 hours away. Having never met, they have worked together on weather data to aid amateur astronomers in finding out "when it will be clear for observing".<br> Mr. Danko states he is a "software weenie by profession."<br> Mr. Allan Rahill has been an amateur astronomer for 33 years. He says he "keeps a 22" Bartelised Dobsonian in the back of his car, and a C-14 in his "backyard observatory".  He has been working in meteorology for 22 years all across Canada, for the last ten years at the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) as an operational forecaster.<br>
Both gentlemen, in addition to excellent amateur astronomers, have a great sense of humour!

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AD:</span><br>
I recently did software architecture for a large Canadian company until they decided to pay me to not work for them, along with 55,000 other people.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
How did you become interested in Astronomy?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AD:</span><br> 
I had just learned to read in grade one. A friend of mine suggested that I borrow a book from  the library to read at home. I thought this rather odd since books were things that teachers made you read in school. But I borrowed a book called "Joe's Luck", at his suggestion. It was about 'A Person That Never Existed' doing things 'That Never Happened'. I was  unimpressed. When I returned the book, I chanced upon a little book called "The Stars". It was about things that were real. To use a phrase from the 60's, "it blew my little mind". Years later I found a
copy of that book in a used book shop. It was curiously tiny. I re-read it and realised that I had understood essentially nothing in grade one. But it had left me with a permanent sense of wonder.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Interesting that you remember the names of both books.<br> 
Attilla tells me he first started observing at age 12, "with a Tasco refractor, and again, in my early 20's with a Dynamax 8 SCT." 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AD:</span><br>
I had no idea why I couldn't see anything, so I stuck to reading about astronomy. It wasn't until later when I joined an astronomy club in Ottawa and started attending star parties that I figured out what observing really was and that it was so much fun.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br> 
Attilla agrees that the "social aspect" is what helped him to become "starstruck".<br>
Allan, tell me about the CMC.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AR:</span><br>
It is the equivalent to the NCEP in Washington, D.C. and UKMET in Bracknel. It is <u>the</u> weather center where worldwide data is collected by our powerful computer facilities and where new weather models are developed and are run twice daily. There is one big weather center like this in each large industrial country. I am lucky to have the best weather tools to work with each day which also help to plan astronomy trips. I share this information joyfully with local clubs by sending emails on the Quebec astro-list server advising when there are Excellent Seeing Conditions.<br>
<a href="http://www2.globetrotter.net/astronomie_au_quebec/index.htm" class="nav2">www2.globetrotter.net/astronomie_au_quebec/index.htm</a>.

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br> 
So how did you get into this 'astro-data hobby'?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AR:</span><br>
I was faced with a problem. More and more amateur astronomers were calling me at the office and at home for the weather. About 2 years ago, Arny Alfeim, a CMC employee, created a high resolution cloud forecast map. They were infrared images forecast by the regional model for up to 48 hours. I realised they were quite accurate and I was amazed at the quality.
<a href="http://www.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/htmls/clds_ir_e.html" class="nav2">www.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/htmls/clds_ir_e.html</a><br>
<a href="http://www.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/images/cld_reg_ps_ecan2_024.jpg" class="nav2">www.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/images/cld_reg_ps_ecan2_024.jpg</a>.<br>
That was one and a half years ago, and my site: 
<a href="http://cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/htmls/mainpage.html" class="nav2">http://cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/htmls/mainpage.html</a> was only geared toward Canada and northern USA. Then I emailed clubs across the country and some astro-lists in the US announcing this product. I gave lectures at several clubs and after finding some had difficulty in understanding the infrared pictures, I created the following:<br>
<a href="http://www.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/htmls/clds_vis_e.html" class="nav2">www.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/htmls/clds_vis_e.html</a><br>
<a href="http://www.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/images/NT_E_p15_00z.gif" class="nav2">www.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/images/NT_E_p15_00z.gif" class="nav2"></a><br>
<a href="http://www.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/images/NT_W_p15_00z.gif" class="nav2"></a><br>
(which are used by Attilla). Like Attilla, and many other astronomers out there, I also had frequently driven for hours only to find poor sky conditions. So I developed the sky transparency forecast which is based on humidity.  These images were tuned from GOES water vapour and amateur astronomers' observations.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
So this is where Attilla stepped in? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AR:</span><br>
Yes, last summer Attilla got the idea to produce the CSC for exact localities and transformed UTC to local time.  This is what I like about this hobby: One has a good idea and the next perfects it with a final product which is useful for all. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Allan and Attilla both comment on the "sharing attitude" of the astro-community and how "Amateur Astronomers' spontaneous ideas have added to more optimal observing nights for all."
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AD:</span><br> 
Indeed. The tiny amount of time I spend observing (in comparison to mundane exploits like "working", or "looking for a job", "filling out tax  returns" or "other things" that will make exactly zero difference on the times scales seen in astronomy has become increasingly precious to me. It's one of the reasons why I really appreciate Allan's
astronomy forecasts, and why I wrote the Clear Sky Clocks.

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br> 
These CSC's have been a great help to everyone I know who has used them in the amateur astronomy community.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AD:</span><br>
Well, I want no one to miss a clear night. If it hadn't been for the Clear Sky Clock for my home town, I would have slept through the 2001 Leonid storm. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Ah, the Leonids! Maybe the best light show of the decade! So what do you guys enjoy observing up in Canada on a Clear and Cool Mid Summer's Eve? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AD:</span><br>
Galaxies. Particulary Big Bright Spirals. I bought a 25" Dob just so I could see the spiral structure in M51, which is my favorite galaxy. I also love to strain to see 15th and 16th magnitude galaxies. I use their visibility as a test of sky transparency.<br>
Supernovae. They scare the heck out of me. Every time I see them, I hope all the Sentients from 50ly around caught the last Airbus out of the System. Quasars, particularly the Lensed Quasar in Ursa Major near NGC3079.<br>
Planetary Nebulae. They come in an endless variety. Globulars. M15 is my favorite, particularly as one of its zillion stars has burst into tiny 15th mag. planetary nebula I've only managed to glimpse it only once. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AR:</span><br>
I also like challenging planetary objects such as Pease 1 in M15, which again, requires good seeing and high power for one to succeed in viewing it.  
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AD:</span><br>
Big Emission Nebulae. Like M42, The Veil and the North American Nebula. These are just breathtaking in a short focus refractor with a wide field eyepiece and narrowband nebula filter. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AR:</span><br>
I am a dedicated observer of Planetary Nebulae and Edge-On Galaxies. I always look forward to the best seeing so I can boost my 22" home-made Bartelised Dobsonian to 600-1200x. These objects have a lot to offer with a lot of easy-to-spot detail at high magnifications. The Cat's Eye Nebula gives me the impression it is looking at me, the Clown Nebula is weird as it looks like a clown at any angle we look at it, the Little Dumbbell resembles a Barred Spiral Galaxy. The Saturn Nebula at 1000x is just incredible with two rings and fine details. I also enjoy NGC 246, NGC40, NGC3242 (Ghost Nebula) and lately IC418 which appears pink at 200x. All among my preferred Planetary Nebulae. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AD:</span><br>
And let's add to that- Planetary Detail. I like to watch swirling inside the Great Red Spot, seeing Io as a little lemon-yellow disk in front of Jupiter's beige bands, endless spots, ovals and swirls in Jupiter, fleeting detail on Ganymede, and the rings of Saturn. (Don't let anyone tell you big Dobsonians can't show planetary detail). 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AD:</span><br>
The Moon is so often overlooked but it is
 a
  source of incredible detail. I have seen detail in
 the
  Floor of Schroter's Valley with my 25". 
  (25" to look at the moon, you gasp!).
  Well, with my little refractor, the blackness of
 the
  maria, the brilliant white of the mountains, and
 the
  peppering of tiny craters down to the limit of
  visibility make it a "Feast for the Senses" that
 is
  very satisfying! 
  Solar Prominences, Faculae, and what looks to me
 like
  "Cat Hair on the Sun". 
  The Sun is fascinating to look at WITH THE RIGHT
  FILTER. 
  It's one of the few astronomical observations
 where
  you can see changes from minute to minute. It's
 much
  like watching clouds. 

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
"Cat Hair on The Sun" - I like that!
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AR:</span><br>
It is very inspiring to listen to Attila
  describe his favorite objects and I always have
 the
  feeling or the need to go observing after
 listening to
  his observations!
  One of the most impressive objects to me is the
 Swan
  Nebula M17 as seen with the "BinoViewer", sitting
 back
  on a lounge-chair and spending time enjoying all
 the
  swirls and deep contrast. I get the same "warm and
  fuzzy feeling" as I do looking at the classic M42
 at
  400x (again with the BinoViewer) where a half
 dozen
  more stars are easily seen in the background of
 the
  Trapezium. 

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
 And your CSC's definitely let you know viewing
 of
  your favorite objects is achievable in a "Specific
  Nocturnal Setting"!

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AR:</span><br>
Yes, and when the Seeing is great, I have
  difficulty leaving the giant planets. 
  It is so impressive to look at detail at 800x. It
 is a
  rare event at our latitude (about 11 nights a
 year),
  but during these clean and steady nights, I
 remember
  looking at specific detail on Ganymede. I always
 use
  my BinoViewer for planetary observing. 

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
So, Attilla and Allan, you are definitely not
  armchair astronomers! 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AR:</span><br>
Not by any means!
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AD:</span><br>
I consider myself an eclectic observer
 who
  observes for the pure pleasure of it, for 'the
  wondrous', not because I am trying to accomplish
  anything. I don't do CCD imaging or collect
 scientific
  data (like photometry or occultation timings), yet
 I
  have the highest respect for everyone I've met who
  images and collects scientific data. (I have been
 most
  lucky in having met people who have done
 world-class
  work in both fields).

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
But you both seem to be so gratified by what
 you
  see! Why not do CCD imaging?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AD:</span><br>
 I don't do any imaging because I figure I
 can
  wait to do that when my Eyesight begins to fail.
  Besides no image, no matter how wonderful, has
 caused
  me to spontaneously swear. But I carry on like
  that at the eyepiece all the time. For me, images
  simply do not carry the emotional response that
 using
  one's own retina does. 

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
O.K., so what else 'catches your eye'? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AD:</span><br>
One other thing I'd like to do, which is
  more important than Object Lists, is public
 astronomy.
  I take my 25" scope to public star parties and
 show
  200 people a bright globular like M13. If they
 don't
  cry out with an expletive, I know the scope has
 been
  nudged off target. I also do sidewalk astronomy to
  show passers-by the moon in my little refractor.
  It is incredibly gratifying to meet people who
 have
  never looked through a telescope before swoon with
  delight and confess an unrealized interest in
  Astronomy since childhood. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
What's your feeling about Children and the
 Skies?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AD:</span><br>
It's especially cool to let kids look
 through
  a scope. I figure the first person who will land
 on
  Mars is a kid now. A look through a scope might
 make
  the difference between becoming an astronaut or a
  lawyer. 

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AR:</span><br>
I have three boys, 11,13,17. Only the
 youngest
  one is interested in astronomy, Dominic. He likes
 all
  the electronic gadgets around my homemade 22"
  telescope. I bought him a second hand C8 last year
 and
  he is quite happy showing celestial objects to his
  best friends and to the public when we go to star
  parties!

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
And the "accuracy of the clocks" allows you to do all this!
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AR:</span><br>
There is evidence that they are accurate
 about
  80 to 90 percent of the time. It could well be the
  best forecast for astronomers in the world right
 now. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
OK, Mr Danko, trivia time! Monty Python and the CSC.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AD:</span><br>
One of the reasons why I wrote the code
 to
  generate Clear Sky Clocks was to learn the
 language
  "Python". The language's designer had named it
 after
  Monty Python's 'Flying Circus'. (It turned out to
 be a
  wonderful little 'language'.) 

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Gentlemen, tell me more about the "How and Why
 of
  the Wondrous Clock".

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AR:</span><br>
As a meteorologist, I am amazed at the
 quality
  of this product. Last fall I added these two
 windows
  for the southern US States:
 
 <a href="http://www.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/images/NT_SW_p15_00z.gif" class="nav2">www.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/images/NT_SW_p15_00z.gif</a>
 
  <a href="http://www.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/images/NT_SE_p15_00z.gif" class="nav2">www.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/images/NT_SE_p15_00z.gif</a>
For the southwestern US these are good, but for the southeastern US, all weather numerical models have problems in forecasting deep convection from April to October. I am proud of the CMC products
  however most weather models, including high
 resolution
  ETA (US) models have the same problem in handling
  these conditions. 
  We have a new regional model with 15km resolutions
 and
  a new physics package, to be released in June,
 that
  will perfect this resolution problem. The NE, NW,
  and SW quads are still quite accurate for all
 seasons.

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Attilla what was your motivation to "Invent
 the
  Clock"?

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AD:</span><br>
As many inventors will admit, I was
 inspired
  by laziness. I knew about Allan's very accurate,
  astronomy forecast maps. 
  Meteorologist draw maps because they want to
  understand complete weather systems. I just wanted
 to
  know when it would be clear in my back yard. So I
  designed the first clear sky clock to do just
 that: to
  extract data from Allan's many maps for just one
  location. Most do not respond to a minor
 irritation,
  like the one I have described, by writing
 thousands of
  lines of code. But it became real handy when my
  friends started asking me for CSCs of their own. I
  didn't expect to do hundreds of them. But now it's
 too
  much fun to stop. I really enjoy doing something
 that
  helps my fellow amateur astronomers. 

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
So how did you convert Allan's maps into
 "Clock
  Work" ?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AD:</span><br>
I wrote a script to detect when Allan's
 maps
  get updated, which would also download them. Using
 my
  own optical-character-recognition routines, I
 decode
  the dates then figure out which of Allan's
  maps are the right ones to use (non trivial when
 his
  program has hiccuped). I reverse engineer the map
  transform, so I can translate latitudes and
 longitudes
  to precise pixel locations. I do a bit pattern
  recognition on the map overlays and moving cloud
  fronts to pick the right pixel. Then I extract the
  same pixel from the maps, in order of advancing
  time,to generate one clock. I followed up with a
  little database that allows me to do this
  efficiently for several hundred clock sites. The
 whole
  'song and dance' is a mere 8000 lines of Python.

What do your Significant Others think about
 this?
  Do they also get 'High on Astronomy'?

My very patient and lovely wife is an
 ex-nurse
  now working with children at a day-care center.
 She is
  very happy to spend time with them... trés
  enrichissant.

My SO is a professional engineer. She
 manages
  a bunch of software designers. She is one of the
  smartest people I've ever met. She can see mag.
 7.0
  stars when I can see mag. 5.7. But, she hates
 looking
  into any kind of optical instrument and is quite
  unimpressed by my 25" Dobsonian. She likes to
 observe
  meteors, but in general finds observing too darn
 cold.
  She is only really comfortable above 90
 degrees(F).
  She also likes singing, humidity and sailing.

Sounds like she'd love South Texas! Allan advises us he has been labouring for four
  years in his backyard observatory on seeing.


</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AR:</span><br>
Yes, a more difficult project which will be
  available this summer. I would go out at dusk,
 before
  going to bed and early in the morning to measure
 the
  seeing conditions.I kept my observatory open all
 night
  to be sure my C-11 would be in equilibrium with
 the
  environment. Nobody visited my observatory during
 my
  absence during all these years except a skunk! 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AR:</span><br>
Yes it was! But the major challenge was to
 go
  out before bedtime when it was -20C, and then
 getting
  back inside when the Seeing was nearly perfect. I
 have
  a bank of 400 nights in 4 years (90% of all clear
  nights in the Montreal area) resulting in some
  interesting corollations which I will soon
 publish.

Continuous multiple updates on numerous clocks... daily data. 
Heavy work loads and late-night observing!
When do you find the time???
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AD:</span><br>
We find the time because it is something we love to do.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AR:</span><br>
I told my wife that for the next few weeks
 I
  will go to the office on my days off to put an end
 to
  my project on Seeing. She whole-heartedly agreed
 and
  gave me a deadline of a few months!

Allan and Attila, I sincerely thank you for all
 the
  time you have given me and Astronomy Today. You
 know
  that your work is very valuable to us all.

The ULTIMATE MONTY PYTHON:<br> 
<a href="http://www.montypython.net/" class="nav2">www.montypython.net</a><br>
And, as a Monty Python fan, myself, here's a Monty Python and Astronomy Connection written by Mr. Danko
as a parody of the "Four Yorkshiremen". It is a
 sketch
  written for a few of Mr. Danko's friends who he
 says,
  "Have a bad habit of doing Monty Python voices, in
 the
  dark, as they observe though giant Dobsonians."
