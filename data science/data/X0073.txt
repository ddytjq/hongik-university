<p>Hi! I have been playing basketball since fourth grade, and just started 
ninth grade two days ago. So why am I writing this forward for my dad? 
Because he asked me to write about what I've seen from a youth player's point 
of view. I didn't want to do it, but he bribed me.  I now have a CD burner in 
my bedroom, and you coaches have to listen to a fourteen year old girl 
because of it. That's a deal for me, wouldn't you say?</p>

      <p>Even though I have only played basketball for 5 years, it seems like a 
lifetime. For the last four years, I have played over 100 games a year. Just 
this year alone, I have played 100 games from March through August. Because 
of all these games, I have seen coaches from all over the country. I have 
seen some really good ones, but I have seen more of the bad ones. As much as 
I love basketball, I would never play for most of these coaches.</p>

<p>Here is my description of the average coach I have seen. Normally it's a man, 
and he is usually very loud. When one of his players makes a mistake in a 
game, they are benched immediately. Most of the time, the coach will start 
screaming at the guilty player. A lot of coaches will curse at them. 
Remember, we are 10 to 14 year old girls being cursed at. Stupid and idiot 
are two words that are also used a lot.</p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Maybe I would think that this was almost OK if I hadn't seen the other good 
coaches. The good ones I've seen will pull their player to one side and tell 
them what they are doing wrong. Then they will tell the player how to do it 
right. You don't have to do all of this with a smile on your face, but I 
promise you, you don't get great results when you scream at them. 

<p>When an inexperienced player makes a mistake, she may not even know what she 
did wrong. This is when you should tell her what she did wrong, and how to 
correct it. When a true player makes a mistake, they usually know what they 
did wrong. We make mistakes because we are trying too hard, or being too 
aggressive, or because of attitudes. If you want to be a good coach, you need 
to figure out which of the three is our problem , then try to correct it. But 
you won't get any results by screaming at or cursing at a us.  We will ignore 
you, or get so upset that we couldn't make a layup if we had to. 

<p>Have you ever thought, "I sure wish she would listen to me?" If you have ever 
thought this, then your player shut down and is totally trying to ignore you. 
Rather than yell even louder, find out what the problem is. Be a coach, not a 
Nazi. 

<p>For years my parents and I would talk on the way home after every game, and 
most of the time we talked about how badly the other coach acted. Finally my 
dad said he was thinking about writing a book about how not to coach. We 
talked about it for a while, and he decided to write a book about how to 
coach and act instead. 

<p>So now you know why he wrote book 1. My mom and I have had to put up with him 
on the computer. Sometimes we think his computer is his best friend. But 
sometimes he lets us read the e-mails from people who have read his book, and 
it reminds us of why he spent all of this time away from us. So you coaches 
had better pay attention and learn, because I have done without him at times 
because of these books. Make it worthwhile for all of us, and try to be the 
best Coach you can be. Basketball should be fun, try to make it that way. 

<p>Dad didn't say I had to write a lot, so I hope I made my point even though 
it's not very long. As you can tell, I'm not like my dad. My mom says it 
takes him two hours to watch 60 Minutes. I don't like the show, so it only 
takes me one minute to change the station. Thank you for listening to me, and 
thank you for the CD burner. 

<p>Oh, by the way, we normally crush the teams that have screamers and cursers 
for coaches. I wonder why so many losers want to be the center of attention 
by getting that loud? This is one of my dad's saying, but it sure makes a lot 
of sense to me. 

<p>If you want anything else written, I sure could use a DVD player in my room, 
DAD! </p>

<p><b>by Steve Jordan</b>

<p>Last year, Ed Riley wrote a very popular primer for new coaches of youth 
basketball teams. His engaging style and down-to-earth explanations made the 
seemingly daunting task of taking on a youth basketball team seem possible, at least, if 
not downright fun. Hopefully, thanks to Ed, many more parents will be stepping forward 
in this worthwhile cause. And, best of all for the kids, those volunteer coaches will be much 
better informed than their predecessors. If you have not yet enjoyed Ed's writing, try his 
first work, <a href="bballed.html"> Coaching Youth Basketball</a>. 
Its on this site in its entirety.</p>

<p><b>by Ed Riley</b>
<p><i>Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water!</i> 

<p>A little over a year ago I started a project, a booklet. It was a simple 
book, not very long, and easy to read. It was a book for first year YOUTH 
basketball coaches. It was written for the mom or the dad who got drafted 
into coaching their kid's basketball team. It was written for the beginner 
who didn't have a clue where to begin. I tried to take them from the first 
moment they volunteered, through their team selection, to what to teach their 
team, and I even told them what supplies they would need for their first 
practice. I tried to make this so simple that even a simpleton like me could 
understand it. And the name of the book? Coaching Youth Basketball For 
Simpletons Like Me. 

<p>Was the book a success? That depends upon your definition of success. If we 
define success by the number of people who read it, then it was successful 
beyond my wildest imagination. Three different websites carried the book. 
Just on PowerBasket's site alone, I've been told that 300 people a day read 
this book. Add the people who read it on all the other other sites, and 
umpteen thousand people have read the book. Using this as a definition, yes 
it was a success. But that's not my definition. 

<p>I would like to use a different barometer as my measure of success, did it 
help the beginning coach? I receive over 40 e-mails a day from beginning 
coaches saying it did, then asking for more help. This is how I judge 
success, by the # of actual readers who say thanks. So some of you folks 
got the message, and I truly succeeded. 

<p>So why am I tooting my own horn here? I'm not! This is Booklet 2 and if you 
haven't read Booklet one, then reading this one is as useless as ...

<p>So here's what you need to do, go to any of these websites and read Coaching 
Youth Basketball For Simpletons like Me. It's free, it's easy to read, and 
Book 2 won't make much sense to you until you read Book 1. Ok, for you 
Doubting Thomas's out there, here's one for you. How much sense would Star 
Wars parts 5 or 6 have made by themselves, unless you saw the original Star 
Wars? OK, maybe that didn't make sense. But you need to go to any of of the 
following sites  and  find my Book 1.  If you don't read it, a lot of this 
will not make sense to you. R<a href="bballed.html">EAD IT - </a> THEN COME BACK TO THIS. 

<p>Steve Jordan's site, aka Alaska Coach,  is <a href="http://www.alaskalife.net/sjordan/">www.alaskalife.net/sjordan/
</a>Go to Coaches Notebook and look for Coaching Youth Basketball by Ed Riley. 

<p>Coach Larry Dean Jackson's site is <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ljacksonesc5/acoach.html">www.geocities.com/ljacksonesc5/acoach.html
</a>Scroll down until you hit articles, and there's the book. This site also 
gives you lots and lots of plays. 

<p>Powerbasketball  is <a href="http://www.powerbasketball.com/">  www.powerbasketball.com
</a>  Look to the right hand  side of 
the page and you'll find the book. 

<p>OK, I've got my stopwatch out. You have two hours to get there, r<a href="bballed.html">ead it,
</a> and 
get your butt back here. It's one lap for every minute you take over two 
hours, so ....... On you mark - Get set - Go!!! 

<p>Humm te dum dumm, tra la, ho hum. I'm sorry, I got kinda bored waiting for 
you folks to come back. Ah oh, someone cheated! So when I use the term LS you 
are going to know what I mean, right? Yeah, sure. Now get outta here until 
you've read it, OK? 

<p>All righty then, welcome back everyone. I promise not to preach, as much. 
Here's a little of what you can expect from "Surviving Your 2nd Year," a 
whole lotta common sense approaches to the game and teaching the game. I am 
going to go into a few more advanced things, like plays. Wouldn't that be 
novel for me, an actual play or 2? I'm going to go into off-season ball and 
starting your own club. I'm going to go into teaching individual moves that 
will help the player, thus helping the team. And I'm going to answer the #1 
most repeated question from Book ! = How do I set up my players when I start 
my offense? 

<p>What else can you expect, well - I have some  friends that may help me in 
this endeavor, Steve Jordan. Steve's net name is Alaska Coach.  Steve is much 
more of an advanced coach than I. Where I can associate with your 4th or 5th 
graders and what they are going through, Steve can relate to older kids. 
See, he is more advanced than I am. And there will be some other 
coaches that will help out along the way. 

<p>In reality, I am not an advanced basketball guru. I know my limitations and 
to go much further means I need help. I have turned to a few of the coaches 
from Chalk Talk, a website.  These are the coaches I turn to when I need 
help, so I know they can help you, as well as me. 

<p>One thing I do need to point out, the chapters I write do not necessarily 
reflect the other coaches point of view, and the opposite is also true. But 
we all agree, LEARNING THE BASICS IS A GOOD THING! 

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Chapter 1">Chapter 1 </a> - Oh John! Oh Mary! What do we do now that 
the season is over?</font></h3>

<p><b>by Ed Riley</b>

<p>NO, NO NO!!! You can't end Star Wars II with Hans Solo being frozen and make 
me wait another year before I get the next installment. This is just cruel 
and inhumane punishment. NO, NO, NO!!!!! 

<p>Is this how you felt a week after your basketball season ended? You'd think 
that being  grownups  and  big people, you'd know what to do now that you 
finally have some free time, but NOOOOO!!  You missed the little buggers, 
didn't you? No more frustrating moments because someone forgot who they were 
guarding. No more smiles when a player did something right. Even that  you 
could handle, but your whistle being lonely and neglected is more than you 
can take. 

<p>OK, so you didn't want it to end. Well, get a life cause it's over, done, 
fini! There is no more till next year. So just get a life, all right!!!!! 
Unless ......  yes, I said unless. UNLESS YOU  AND YOUR WHOLE FAMILY REALLY 
ENJOYED IT. I'm not saying did you enjoy it. I'm saying you, your spouse, 
your kids, and maybe even your dog needs to have loved it. This is the only 
way I would even begin to recommend the next step into insanity. Is everyone 
really, really missing it??  Well then - - - - - - 

<p><b>IT'S TIME FOR CLUB BALL</b> 

<p>So what is club ball? Here in St. Louis we call it select ball. In other 
parts of the country it's called Club Ball. Club ball is where you try to 
field the best possible players you can possibly put together, and you play 
off season ball. Most basketball goes from November to February. That means 
the prime season is 4 months long. So what's the flip side of this? THEY HAVE 
8 MONTHS TO FORGET EVERYTHING YOU TAUGHT THEM, OR EVEN THOUGHT YOU TAUGHT 
THEM. Isn't that a delightful thought? 

<p>Like everything else in life, you can act or react to situations. Reacting 
means you let your emotional side over rule everything. Acting upon a 
situation means you think things out, before you make a decision. 

<p>OK, Ed, how does this apply to basketball? Or, are you off the deep end 
again? Before you ever decide to do club ball, I believe you need to get 
schizophrenic. You need to sit down beside yourself and discuss why you would 
even want to do club ball. You need to decide  what your priorities are. Are 
you there just so the kids, AND YOU, can have fun? Are you there to teach 
your players more than the regular season allows you, due to time 
constraints? Why are you doing it? Here are a few reasons why you need to 
decide on your priorities, before you ever jump into club ball. 

<p>If you and your players are playing basketball strictly for fun, think long 
and hard about not doing club ball. Here is a graphic example of why not to 
play club ball. 

<p>A 6'5", 200 pound Monster Child gets into a fight with little Johnny. Johnny 
weighs 110 pounds, soaking wet. The fight is to be timed. It is to last 3 
minutes, max. It starts off badly for Johnny. Within the first 60 seconds, he 
already has 2 black eyes and a broken hand. As you watch the fight continue, 
Monster Child never lets up. Even after he pummels Johnny into 
unconsciousness, he still keeps hitting him. You start to scream "Let up 
already, you've won. Quit it, you're killing him!" No matter what you 
say or do, Monster Child will never quit until the 3 minutes are up. 

<p>Got a little graphic on you, didn't I? Sorry, but you really need to see the 
big picture before you react your way into something THAT IS NOT GOOD. 

<p>Club teams can be exact replicas of Monster Child. They are normally coached 
by power hungry, ego-driven, monsters. They want to beat every team by 50 
points or more. They recruit the best talent they can find, and nothing is 
more important than the win. They don't just care about winning, they also 
care about how large a margin they can beat you by. Not every club team is 
like this, but there are enough of them, that it sure seems like it! 

<p>If you have an average old team and are doing it for fun, avoid club ball. 
Your players can lose a lot more than just a game. They can lose their self 
confidence and start thinking of themselves as true losers. Once you believe 
something at a young age, it's hard to reverse that belief. Sometimes it's 
nigh onto impossible to change your image of yourself. 

<p>Kids are strange critters! Once they lose their confidence, they might 
rebound tomorrow, or they may  never rebound. Being beat by a merciless club 
team by a score of 60 to 2, might crush a kid. I have seen great kids with a 
lot of potential quit the game because of beatings like this. They started 
the game with a smile. At the end of the game, their looks and demeanor said, 
"I'm no good. I suck! I hate this game and I'm never going to play it again." 

<p>For an average or below team, club ball is not a Good Thing. Rather than play 
club ball, find an average ole summer league where you and your kids find 
similarly competitive teams and have a blast.

<p><b>LOOKING AT CLUB BALL POSITIVELY</b>

<p>Now let's look at the other side of club ball. My team will be going into 9th 
grade next fall. We have played club ball since 5th grade. Are we God's gift 
to the basketball community? Absolutely not!  We win a lot, we lose a lot. 
Priorities is what this decision is all about. I made up my mind when they 
were in 5th grade what my priorities as their coach should be. My job was to 
teach them enough, so that a player who wanted to, would know enough and be 
good enough to make their high school team. 

<p>By playing club ball, my girls became accustomed to playing the biggest and 
best players in the city. For one of my 5'8" forwards to have to guard a 6'3" 
center, is just no big deal. No one intimidates them because they're used to 
it. Take an average recreational league player, and see what happens when 
they have to play against that same 6'3" center. They freak out to say the 
least. 

<p>By playing club ball, they have learned to become better players themselves. 
Ever hear of the process known as osmosis? I can teach my girls a lot. But 
when they see a really nice player do a new move, they try to imitate, and 
they have learned a lot from simply playing against better players. My girls 
would not be half the player they are today, if we had stayed in a rec 
league. So if your priority is to teach your players the game, then club ball 
may be for you. 

<p><b>THE NEWEST/OLDEST RAGING CONTROVERSY </b>

<p>"But these are just kids. If they play club ball, won't that interfere with 
their other sports?" I've heard this 100 times in the last few years. Guess 
what? Unless your kid is the exception to every rule, it's now a one letter, 
maximum 2 letter, universe. 

<p>I have listened to coaches argue this point for hours. What it boils down to 
is this:  If you live in a small town, there is a good chance you can play 3 
sports and make your high school team. If you live in a large city, it's nigh 
onto impossible. What these coaches are really arguing about is the way they 
would like it to be. 

<p>I live in St. Louis and am going to use my town as the example. Girls start 
playing select basketball in 4th grade. A non-select season lasts 4 months. 
Select teams will play 11 months  a year,  or 7 more months than a non-select 
player. Between what they learn in the extra 7  months from their coach, and 
the extra experience they gain just from playing more, a select player has a 
much better chance of making their high school team, than a non-select 
player. This same scenerio exists in soccer, volleyball, and in  
baseball/softball. 

<p>When you hear someone arguing about kids shouldn't have to decide what sports 
to "major" in at such a young age, you are hearing wishful thinking. I wish 
the same thing as they do. I wish that in 5th grade my daughter could have 
played 3 or 4 different sports, and taken her time figuring out which ONES 
were for her. If she had spent equal time on every sport, and had done this 
up until 7th or 8th grade, she would never have made any of her high school 
teams. If you snooze, you lose! 

<p><b>PRIORITIES </b>

<p>As I said in the beginning it's time for you to make another major decision, 
what are your priorities as a coach? And, you also need to know what your 
players priorities are. You may not be into select or club ball. You are 
coaching for the fun of it, and not worrying about your player's future high 
school team, but what if  some of your players  want to make their high 
school team when they get old enough? If this is the case, help them find an 
off-season team to join. Don't agree to coach off season unless you really 
want to. You either are hooked on the game, or you're not. It's time for you 
o make an honest decision on what your goals are as a coach. Then decide on 
club ball. 

<p><b>OK, I'M CRAZY - LET'S DO IT! </b></p>

<p>You know the saying, "Boy, is he out in left field!" Folks, I bought stock in 
left field, so I have to go there occasionally. This is one of those times. 
You know how you get an idea in your head, and if you don't do something 
about it right then, you know you'll forget it later? And when you do forget 
it, you remember just enough to honestly believe that the one true original, 
money making thought that will change mankind and your life forever, just 
escaped you. That's where this next paragraph is coming from. 

<p>We all have images of things. Some of you are probably imagining us sitting 
in our coaches shorts, whistles around our necks, with a diagram of a 
basketball court in front of us, while we type this out on our keyboards.  ** 
WRONG **  I am sitting in my kitchen, chain smoking, and thinking that an 
Absolute and tonic sure would sound good about now. Blew your image of me, 
didn't I? Actually, I'm not drinking the Absolute because I don't like to 
drink at home. If I drink, it's at a pub or a restaurant. 

<p>Now, the really fun part is have you ever wondered how the author imagined  
the readers of his book? I can see you now. You have just decided to coach 
club ball and you jump up from your monitor.  On your computer desk is a 
plaque from your players that reads, "To The World's Best Coach." On your 
fireplace is a trophy that your team won for coming in 2nd or 3rd in a 
tournament. And you are more proud of that plaque and trophy than anything 
that you ever won at work. I like my image of you folks, so please don't ever 
tell me I'm wrong, OK? I like people whose hearts are in the right place. 

<p>ANYWAY, you jump up and yell, "I'm gonna do it. Club ball is for me!" I can 
see you guys in your tight old fashioned basketball shorts, and they are too 
short. You have long knee-high socks, (the ones with 3 red stripes at the top 
and go all the way up your leg to right below your kneecaps,) brand new Nikes 
on, and an old fashioned he-man shirt on, and your beer gut is hanging out. 

<p>I can see the women who read this. You women aren't as out of touch with the 
fashion world, as are your male counterparts. You have on a matching 
nylon/polyester sweat suit. You know, the one's that go - swish, swish, 
swash as you walk. They make that crinkly, aluminum foil sound as you walk. 
The older women have embroidered stuff on the shoulders and top of the sweat 
suit. The younger of you just have some sports logo on yours. 

<p>None of the above was meant as an insult. Sometimes I just have to go out 
into left field, just for the fun of it. Anyhow - You are ready, when you 
realize you are at home and don't know what to do next. So you sit back down 
in front of your monitor and keep on reading. That brings us to ...

<p><b>HOW TO SELECT PLAYERS FOR YOUR CLUB TEAM </b>
<ol>
<li>The first way is so simple, just take the kids who were on your regular 
team. </li>

<li>If there are some kids from your team that you don't want on your club 
team, just don't invite them. Don't make a big production out of it. No 20 
minute speeches on why you didn't invite them. Just keep your mouth shut and 
don't invite them. When they find out, just tell them what the real reason is 
and again, don't make it long and drawn out. </li>

<li>Have tryouts. I went into this a lot in my first book. I'm going to give 
you 3 simple rules for club ball. Get some heigth. Take ball handlers over 
shooters who can't dribble. (It's easy to teach the ball handlers how to 
shoot.) And don't take anyone who is not coachable. (Superstars with an 
attitude are cancerous and will kill a team.) </li>

<li>Remember, for you more experienced coaches, this is for younger kids. Simple 
is Good! We don't want to get too complicated. If you have a team with kids 
that can handle a ball, have some height, and are coachable, what else do you 
really need at this age? </li>
</ol>

<p>Alright, you win! You want some drills for your tryouts, so here you go: 

<ol><li>Have them do a suicide while dribbling the ball right handed. Then have 
them do one while dribbling left handed. This will show you about their 
agility, speed, ball handling, and endurance. </li>

<li>Have them play a 3-on-3 game. This shows you ball handling, whether they 
are a team player, whether they have court vision, and can they shoot. </li>

<li>Have them play a no dribble scrimmage. This let's you see if they can 
move without the ball. It also shows you their passing abilities, and court 
vision. </li>
</ol>

<p>This is all you really need for this age. I presently coach 8th grade girls 
and needed several players. For the tryouts, I had them do #1 and #2, and 
that's it. 

<p>All this seems too simple, right? Well, there is a small catch to it. If you 
are interested in a player after they pass your tryouts, tell them they are 
invited to 2 or 3 of your L.S.'s. No final decision will be made until then. 
Get them to your L.S.'s so you can find out if they are coachable. 

<p>Here's why I suggest this.  I am coaching my daughter's 8th grade team. As I 
told you before, we are a club or select team. There is a girl who is a young 
9th grader that wanted to join our team and she was about the same age as my 
girls. Her resume was great, she was awarded the mvp of her freshman team. I 
have an mpv 9th grader trying out for  my 8th grade team, seems like 
everything is right in the world, right? 

<p>I accepted this girl on the team on a temporary basis, until I saw how she 
played in a game. Folks, this girl never learned anything about m-2-m 
defense. Sure, she had a sweet little shot, but that's all she had. Whoever 
was her previous coach had neglected passing and defense. This made me thank 
the day that I decided not to take a player until she had played with us for 
a while. 

<p>I will take a coachable average kid over a superstar with an attitude every 
time.  If they pass your tryouts and are coachable, sign them up. And 
speaking of signing them up, get everyone of them to sign a contract. This 
will help you avoid 90% of all of your future problems. You will find a 
sample contract in Book 1. 

<p><b>GYMTIME FOR YOUR LS'S </b>

<p>In book 1, I spent a lot of time giving you the info on how to do this. So if 
you have forgotten, go back to Book 1. 

<p><b>FINDING GAMES TO PLAY </b>

<p>Again, I spent a lot of time on this in my first book. The basics are all

<p>This gives you what you need to start your first club team, so  I'm going to 
end this chapter the same way I began it. You need to decide what your

a positive direction for them to follow.

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Chapter 2">Chapter 2</a> - Goals for Year Two</font></h3>

<p><b>by Ed Riley</b>

<p>Alrighty then, we have off-season ball out of the way. Now let's go on to our 
main course, your second year of coaching regular season ball. Before every 
new season, I highly recommend you have a nice long internal look at 
yourself. Did you enjoy coaching last year? Do you think your team enjoyed 
playing basketball last year, and still learned something? Do you really want 
to do it again? I know, I know, if you didn't want to do it again, you 
wouldn't be going cross eyed in front of your monitor at the moment, now 
would you? I got the message, so let's move on. 

<p>I always think and talk about priorities and goals. It's now time to go back 
to them again. It's goal setting time. No, I'm not talking about how many 
wins do you want this year. I'm not talking about winning your league or a 
tournament. COACH = TEACHER AND ROLE MODEL so we need to figure out what your 
players should reasonably be expected to know, and do, by the end of their 
second year. This will then let you know what you have to teach them this 
year. Gosh, am I simple, or what? Don't answer that!

<p>Now on to something different. I believe that as a coach, you have to do your 
best to make basketball fun for your players. Remember, when these kids first 
signed up, they signed up to play a game because games are supposed to be 
fun. Well, I believe that this book needs to be fun as well. I know that I 
hate boring technical crap, so let's have a little fun. Here's a little story 
for you, hope you like it. 

<h3><b><a name="What About Bob?">What About Bob?</a></h3>

<p>Ever had a ref that had it in for you? No? Yeah, right! Well Rob is a ref 
here in town that must hate my team. He will call 20 plus fouls against my 
team and 2 against the other team. We may be aggressive, but not that 
aggressive compared to everyone else. The sad part is, he has reffed at least 
15 of our games. 

<p>We had a big tournament game coming up and I found out that Rob was going to 
ref our game. Being my normal elfish self, I went to my favorite store, 
Spencer Gifts. Alas, they didn't didn't carry what I wanted. But, they did 
send me to a mom and pop specialty store that did carry it. I went there, 
found what I needed and I was ready. 

<p>Because Rob had reffed at least 15 of our games,  I knew his routine. He 
would walk in the gym, set his bag down on the bleachers, walk across the 
court, confer with the scorer's at the scorer's table, go back to the 
bleachers and change into his gym shoes. A lot of refs have this same routine. 

<p>Game day was no different, he left his bag on the bleachers, walked across 
the court, and conferred with the scorers. I sent one of my players to the 
scorer's table and she started asking him all sorts of questions about how 
she could avoid some of her normal fouls. Rob stuck out his chest proudly and 
began to expound on all of the things he knew nothing about. 

<p>While he was bragging on his knowledge, or lack of, I walked over to the 
bleachers. I got into his bag and took out his gym shoes. 

<p>Let me tell you about most gym shoes. There is a place in the front of the 
shoe that is ever so slightly tilted up, it's right under the tops of your 
toes. I taped a small pellet to the bottom of each of his  shoes in this 
area. Where the sole meets the front of the shoe is where these pellets went. 

<p>Oh, another thing about Rob, he's big. OK, he's fat. He doesn't move out of a 
little 4 foot area much, when he refs. It makes the other refs so mad, they 
filed a complaint with the league about him. 

<p>Anyway, I then put his shoes back in his bag and hurried back to my bench. 
Rob finally came back to bleachers and put on his gym shoes. 

<p>Next he positioned himself close to the scorer's table. The scorer's 
themselves consisted of a parent from each team. 

<p>Finally, the game started. Every time we got the ball, my players would 
dribble close enough to Rob to make him jump out of their way. After he 
jumped out of their way 3 or 4 times, he started staring at the scorers, with 
the God awfullest look on his face. 

<p>I looked at the scorers and they had an equally scrunched up face and were 
staring at each other, and then they started staring at Rob, with his too 
tight referee's shirt that was trying to hide his beer belly. 

<p>I started to lose it. What I had done was tape a small, but deadly, stink 
bomb to the bottom of Rob's shoes. In his jumping around to get out of the 
way of my player's way, he had broken open the gel packed pellets and 
unleashed the results of every frightened skunk in the neighborhood. So the 
scorers were staring at beer belly Rob, and he was staring at them. Finally 
the woman couldn't stand it any more and she got up and left the table. The 
man at the table signaled Rob it was alright and he could handle it until 
she came back. 

<p>A girl on the other team was lazily bringing the ball up the court, when she 
passed within 2 feet of Rob. She stopped for a moment, shook her head a 
couple of times and then stared at Rob. Then she made a beeline for the 
opposite side of the court. I think she must have stayed too long, because 
she passed to a teammate, then rubbed her eyes a couple of times. Then she 
just stared at Rob for the longest time, then started laughing. 

<p>By now you could see the other scorer fanning his nose and shaking his head. 
Rob moved  a dozen feet or so away from the scorers table. He totally ignored 
the game and just kept glaring at the scorer. Moving didn't help. Pretty soon 
he was rubbing his eyes. You could see that they were all red and tears were 
running down his face. 

<p>My team knew what was happening, so they avoided Rob's side of the court. All 
the other team saw was that Rob's side of the court was wide open. Every 
chance they got, a hapless player would dribble into the invisible fog bank, 
only to come out gagging and staring at Rob. 

<p>Rob moved a few more feet down the court. This time he stationed himself 
about 8 feet away from a cluster of parents. Pretty soon you could see them 
turn around and absolutely glare at the people beside them, in back of them, 
and in front of them. 

<p>Finally one old lady looked at her husband and shrieked, "Can't you control 
that in public?" That was too much, I lost it.  

<p>Rob called a referee's time out and went to the opposite side of the court to 
talk to the other ref. The whole time he was walking he was staring at the 
sole remaining scorer. He hadn't talked to the other ref for over 10 seconds, 
when you could see it hit the other ref. It about rocked him to his knees. 

<p>The other ref finally said, "Jesus, Rob! What are you doing? Have you lost 
it?" Then he walked away. 

<p>Remember Rob popped not one, but 2 stink bombs, so it lingered and lingered.  
I don't remember much about that game, but I will never forget the looks and 
the faces.  Teams, and refs, and fans alike, still talk about  that game and 
Rob. I will probably talk about it for years to come. </p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Chapter 3">Chapter 3</a> - Tryouts ... How to Select Your Players</font></h3>

<p><b>Tryouts</b> by Coach Darrell Garrison

<p>One of the most exciting and stressful parts of a young player’s life can be 
trying out for an athletic team where they have to show a coach they deserve 
to be on that team.  You have those players who are extremely confident in 
their abilities along with those who have a lot of self doubt or are just not 
confident in themselves.  Sometimes as a coach you have to look past what 
might be obvious on the court, and see if a players personality or lack of 
confidence is keeping the player’s real talent or potential from being 
obvious. 

<p>When holding basketball tryouts I am mainly looking at two areas in 
particular: <i>attitude/character</i> and <i>athleticism.</i>  The area on 
attitude/character is a very wide area with many components; each of them are important 
in their own way.  I feel that 
attitude/character can be broken down into a few subcategorizes with the 
total character of a player being a compilation of the parts. 

<p><b>Attitude/character: </b>

<p>Enthusiasm is so important in anything you do.  Henry Ford has said that, 
<i>“Nothing great was ever accomplished without enthusiasm”.</i>  I love 
enthusiastic people, however enthusiastic people can be a bit of a trial to 
those who are not.  Coaching and teaching enthusiastic players is fun!  They 
help keep the team fired up; they help keep spirits high; they keep teammates 
working and they certainly make the coaches job much easier. 

<p>The only way a coach can get his points across is if the players are 
attentive.  When coaching youth basketball it is imperative that the coach has the player’s 
attention.  Some young people have a hard time focusing and paying attention 
to what is said or shown.  There might be outside reasons for a poor 
attention span.  The player may be distracted by other things going on in the 
gym, maybe he has had a rough day at school or at home, or maybe just by an 
anxiety to get started.  Whatever the reason if a player can not refocus and 
isn’t attentive it will adversely effect the team’s performance. 

<p>How hard are young people expected to work in today’s society?  It seems like 
today’s youth doesn’t have the same work ethic and attitude toward work that 
players have had in the past.  Busy home lives and busy parents are just a 
couple of reasons that players don’t work as hard as they did years ago when 
there were simpler times and less distractions and conveniences.  The coach 
needs to set his expectations of the work ethic from day one.  Players will 
give a great effort for a coach who is fair and tells the players what to 
expect.  I player that takes shortcuts in his work ethic isn’t worth keeping 
on the team. 

<p>Most importantly the coach must set the tone of the practice, especially with 
young athletes.  Many youngsters don’t fully grasp what a great work ethic is, how 
to channel their enthusiasm positively, how to focus their attention and how 
to show and feed a positive attitude.  All of these go a long way to help 
establish a young person’s character, and a long way to helping decide who 
should make the team. 

<p><b>Athleticism: </b>

<p>The second thing I would look at would be the athleticism of the players 
trying out.  I feel that you can teach a willing athlete the fundamental 
skills necessary to be a dominating player, but you can’t necessarily teach a 
player with fundamental skills to be an athlete. 

<p>Please don’t get the idea that I feel fundamentals aren’t important.  The 
ideal player would be an athlete with great fundamental skills.  Hopefully 
within the group of players that you have trying out for your team, there 
will be a mix of athletes along with those who have decent skills yet aren’t 
as athletic. 

<p>Most drills I would use during the tryout sessions would be timing and goal 
setting drills.  Players will rise to the forefront when faced with a drill 
that forces them to meet a goal in a certain amount of time (i.e. how many 
power lay ups in 30 seconds). 

<p>In tryouts I will run drills that measure defensive quickness, change of 
direction and aggressiveness.  I want to know how quickly a player can get from point A to 
point B, if a player can cut off a dribbler and force them to turn or pick up 
the dribble, and if a player will go on the floor for a loose ball.  I will 
use drills that show a player’s foot speed; rebounding, outlet and sprint the 
floor; ball handling at full speed, and changing direction with the ball at 
full speed. 

<p>I will get all players in the tryouts involved in some type of full court 
scrimmage, but I will not use a scrimmage as the sole evaluation tool.  I 
want to see how they handle themselves in game situations, if they have court 
sense, and how they work at the offensive and defensive ends. 

<p>My youngest son tried out for the school basketball team for the first time 
in eighth grade.  He had such physical skills (he was a sprint, hurdles, high 
jump, and long jump champion later in high school), yet he had never 
expressed interest or love for basketball.  I could have taught him all he 
needed to know to be great player, but a person has to love the game and want 
to learn it.  Even though he had never played the game  before, the coaches 
kept him on the team because of his athleticism and work ethic, and cut 
numerous players who had much better skills.  The feeling was that you can 
always find players who had some skills (at that age), but it is tough to 
find such a good athlete with great size.  Although it didn’t work out in 
this situation (he only played basketball that one year), I would have made 
the same call in the same situation.  You can always teach an athlete some 
skills, but a player with skills isn’t always an athlete, and athletes win 
championships. </p>

<p><b>Drills:</b></p> 

<p>I want to give you a set of drills that I would use to help evaluate the 
players who were trying out.  These drills would show the skills of the 
players while being able to showcase their athleticism. 

<p><b>Rebound Outlet:</b>  The player would toss the ball off the backboard, jump, 
rebound, pivot and outlet to a coach in the outlet area (near the sideline as 
high as the foul line).  He would then follow the outlet, cut behind the 
coach and sprint to the opposite basket.  The coach would then throw a long 
baseball pass for the player to chase down at full speed, gather in and make 
a lay-up.  You could continue the drill with each player, then move to the 
other end and have them all come back, or you could have the first player 
grab his own rebound of the lay-up , outlet to another coach at that end and 
come back.  This drill could be continuous. 

<p><b>Power Lay-ups:</b>  This is a timed drill (30 seconds is a good time to maximize 
top effort) that you can use with a player at each basket in the gym.  The 
player stands on either side of the basket with a ball.  On the whistle the 
player executes a power lay-up (jumping off both feet).  As the ball comes 
through the basket he catches the ball. As his baseline-side foot steps, he 
pivots on that foot and powers the ball up on the other side of the basket.   
He again catches the ball as the baseline-side foot steps down, pivots and 
powers the ball back up on the original side.  This back and forth action 
continues for the entire 30 seconds as other players count the made baskets.   
Baskets should be recorded.  I would do this drill 2-3 times at different 
times during the workout and total the results. 

<p><b>Defensive Slide Drill:</b>  The player would start at the corner of the court, 
facing down court.  Set cones about every 15 feet up the court alternating from the 
corner to the middle of the court 15 feet up court, back to the sideline to the middle 
every 15 feet.  On the whistle they would defensive slide (taking short chop 
steps and never crossing their legs) from the corner back and forth up court   
until they reach the end of the court.  Time how long it takes the player to 
make it to the opposite end. 

<p><b>Shooting Drill:</b>  Set 5-7 cones or spots in a semi-circle from 10 feet to 18 
feet from the basket depending on the age of the players.  The player has 
anywhere from one to two minutes to make as many baskets as he can.  After 
each shot, he must get his own rebound and dribble in back out to one of the 
spots on the floor.  Keep track of the number of baskets the player can make 
in the allotted time. 

<p><b>Full Court Lay-ups:</b>  This drill will give you an idea of the player’s 
conditioning and stamina.  Have the player start at the far baseline.  On the whistle he must 
speed dribble the length of the court and make a lay-up.  He gets his own 
rebound and speed dribbles back to the first end for another lay-up.  This 
drill continues for anywhere from one to two minutes, counting the number of 
baskets made. 

<p><b>Full Court Combination Drill:</b>  I like to use my imagination on this drill.   
It can change every time I run it.  An example might be like this:  Start on the baseline 
and weave dribble through a set of 5-7 cones spaced about 6 feet apart.   
After the player gets through the cones he would go hard for a lay-up.  After 
the lay-up he would grab his rebound and dribble to a side basket for a 15’ 
jump shot, rebound, dribble to the next side basket for another 15’ jump 
shot, grab his rebound and go the the closest main basket for a lay-up.  At 
each basket he must stay at that basket until he makes a shot or has three 
misses before he can move on to the next basket.  I then take the amount of 
time from the beginning until the last lay-up is made.  This is a great drill 
which, as I said can be changed by using a little imagination. 

<p>The importance of the timing and scoring of these drills will help to give 
you the best ball players possible.  I feel that by using these drills or 
some like them you can find those athletes who will help your team win.  In 
my opinion, when a team of athletes who have developed skills meets the team 
of ball players with skills but limited athleticism, the athletes will win 
almost every time. </p>

<p><b><font color="#0000FF">A Word (or two) About Tryouts</font></b> by Steve Jordan, Coach's Notebook</p>

<p>Basketball tryouts can be difficult for coaches. For small schools, there may be limited 
number of aspirants, but typically there are dozens of enthusiastic players hoping to make a 
team. Even in programs like the YMCA Youth Basketball leagues that endeavor to offer an 
opportunity for everyone to play, there may be a limited number of teams due to a lack of 
coaches or sponsors. The end result, in a high school program or a youth league organization, 
is that some kids will not get a chance to participate. It is usually the coaches that make 
the painful decision of who gets cut. Tryouts for basketball are usually very difficult and 
brief periods to evaluate dozens of eager players. Other complications include adequate gym 
space, complexity in organizing large numbers of candidates and trying to measure critical 
subjective attributes such as skills, potential and character. 

<p>The most important attribute for the tryout period is a sense of fairness among the candidates. If everyone has an equal chance to show their skills, the final decisions on player selection will probably be accepted by the players and their parents. If some players are considered favorites, by not actively participating or by receiving a disproportionate share of exposure, the slighted players will be disgruntled.

<p>In every tryout, there will be some players that stand out as obvious picks for the team. The difficulty for the coaches is in deciding who will fill the bottom half of the roster. For instance, one player may have fewer skills than another, but shows more potential. It may seem like the best answer is to pick the player with the most potential and develop him/her, but try to determine the degree of coachability. In my arrogance, I have chosen players with good physical characteristics with the belief that I could mold them into a fine basketball player, only to struggle all season with attitude problems or poor attendance. An area where a coach's stereotypes can get in the way is dismissing candidates that don't have the outward appearance normally associated with a basketball player. I have passed on players that I thought were too short or too heavy only to end up competing against them to my team's detriment, so look carefully at the full range of contribution each player has to offer.

<p><i>Here is some advice that may help:</i>
<p><b>Tryout Suggestions</b>
<p>Before you start, declare your expectations. Try and put yourself in the kids' shoes. They're all probably nervous and anxious to please, but they don't know what to expect. So, tell them. Describe a theoretical, ideal candidate. Don't use a real life example, or worse, one of the candidates. In fact, don't set any player above the others. To give you an example, here's an opening address:

<p>"Thank you all for attending basketball tryouts. I know you are nervous, excited and eager to get busy, but let me take a minute to tell you what the coaches are looking for. We don't have very much time to look at you, so first impressions are very important. For that reason, don't hold anything back. Show us what you have. Any hidden talent or effort you take home with you will be qualities we don't know about. 

<p>First impressions include how you dress. Are you dressed to play or dressed for style? You get no points for style in the tryouts. 

<p>A second impression will be how willing you are to work hard. It means a lot if you are already in great physical shape. But it also means a lot if you're not in great shape, but are willing to get there. If you are still trying your best even when you are tired, we will notice that. If you give up easily when you're fatigued, we'll notice that, too. 

<p>Do you know how to listen? We will be asking to do a variety of drills, many of which may be new to you. Its OK if you don't know a drill, but its not helpful to you if you do not pay attention to directions. 

<p>Are you willing to perform the skills according to the coaches' directions? We will be stressing fundamental techniques and may ask you to perform skills differently than you are used to. Its far more important to us that you attempt the skill properly and be awkward rather than repeat a bad habit that you are comfortable with. For example, let's say you cannot shoot left handed layups well so you insist on shooting with your right hand. It doesn't matter to me that the shot goes in if it was made with the wrong hand. The point is that if you are not willing to change, we can't make you any better than you are now.

<p>Finally, your basketball skills are meaningless if you cannot maintain your grades or get your paperwork in on time. Being on the basketball team is a special privilege, and it requires a great deal of time and commitment. If your level of responsibility isn't mature enough to manage a busy schedule and basketball, then you shouldn't be in the program. Further, if your grades are marginal, then there is a risk to the entire team that you may not be available at the end of the semester. The coaches will weigh that risk into the decision whether or not to select you as a basketball player.

<p>Observe players performing exact same skill sets. Be sure to cover basics such using either hand for ball-handling and shooting. Young players can learn to use their weak hand for dribbling and shooting within the course of a season. After that first year, they will use either hand without a second thought. The longer a player remains single-handed, the harder it becomes to change. Single-handed players are an extreme liability at a competitive level because they are so easy to guard. 

<p>Should you score every player on different skills? It's a nice idea and it would be great to have a list with the players sorted by score. The objective approach may quell some backlash as you have documents to back your decisions. However, most coaches would rather trust their instincts. It's difficult to measure people with numbers. How do you score court sense or passing ability? At best you could score players as good - fair - poor and various scores, but that doesn't really differentiate the individuals very well. Besides, it is really tough to run a tryout and keep track of scores. 

<p>Avoid putting too many players on the team. Ten is the ideal number because each player will get 
an equal amount of practice time in scrimmages and the game time substitution rotations can be very 
simple. Twelve player teams are common and provide coverage for injuries and other contingencies, 
but usually the 11th and 12th players receive few minutes of playing time. Having more than twelve 
players practically guarantees dissatisfaction over playing time throughout the course of the season. 
Adding extra player to avoid the pain of cuts is a short-term solution. 

<p>Maintain a balance of talents on your team, assuming there are enough players in the tryout pool. 
If all your players are alike, there will be consistent weaknesses in your game plans. If your team 
is tall but cannot handle the ball, or is fast but too short to rebound well, your game strategy will 
be compromised. 

<p>Decide if players have the will to do conditioning. If players are out of shape, they may be 
worthwhile to pick up. Watch for those that quit easily during the tryout drills. If the players 
in your program do not want to train, it will be nearly impossible to be competitive. 

<p>Look for players who have already mastered fundamentals and show a good grasp of court sense. 
They have already proven they have a devotion to the game and are coachable. Players who are 
physically appealing, but unskilled, MUST show a willingness to learn and change. Too often players 
blessed with physical advantages are convinced they are good enough and only need try harder when 
the game gets tough. Over the course of the season, however, players with average ability 
eventually surpass the value of the gifted athlete because of their new skills and experience. 
Ultimately, the gifted athlete becomes a liability if he/she plays in a manner contrary to the 
team direction. Time invested in team offense and defensive strategies is wasted if one member 
elects to take ill-advised shots or is irresponsible on defense. Basketball favors the advantaged 
athlete, however. All other things being equal, quickness and height are hard to beat. 

<p>Do not waste time on players that are argumentative or cannot pay attention. End of story. 
<p>Be leery of players that cannot get their paperwork in on time. 
<p>Insist on timeliness as a condition to staying in the program. 
<p>Consider grade point averages when making cuts. A marginal student may not be able to 
finish the season. There is a School District rule in Alaska that makes any student with less 
than a 2.0 GPA ineligible to play or practice. If you are coaching in a youth group league 
like the YMCA, grades are still an important factor. Some parents will not allow their child 
to play anywhere if their grades don't meet family standards. Counter-point: If basketball 
can motivate anyone to improve their grades - that's wonderful. 

<p><b>Difficult Decisions - That Last Cut</b>
<p>Team chemistry is built around commitment. Some coaches in areas with large talent pools can 
weed out the possible problem players and not suffer much, but coaches starving for talent must 
make more agonizing decisions. It is really hard to let a prospect go that has the physical 
characteristics you desire or has the ability to play at a higher level than the rest. Yet, 
coaches that have been around a while get quite familiar with the uncommitted "star" that 
misses practices, won't work at conditioning, bickers with teammates - and on and on. At 
some point it isn't worth it to try and build a team around an uncommitted person. This is 
especially true once you have had the joy of working with a group of unselfish kids that exceeded 
all expectations simply because they worked hard and worked together.

<p>When you decide to choose a player that had commitment problems, make that choice with your head 
and not your vanity. After all, you are burdening some of the most important people in your life - 
your team - with the problem child and the situation will probably last ALL season. Is it possible 
for a kid to respond to a basketball team and improve character? Yes. Can a coach "change" a person 
through effort and values? No. That's the vanity - thinking you can force it. The right kid, at the 
right time in life, will respond. It may not matter who the coach is.

<p>If you find a special player that needs help, its critical to have the commitment to the team. 
If the player isn't willing to practice, work hard, do fund raising, follow your instructions to the 
letter, conform to team rules - in short, change for the team, it won't work out.

<p><b>What about the marginal player that "paid dues"?</b>
<p>The dedicated attender isn't always the best choice. I've seen some cases where a player has 
always been included in the program because of his "attitude", but objectively speaking, hadn't 
really improved much despite the camps, etc. Finally, at some point in his career, he's cut and 
the parents get really upset because the kid "paid his dues". They really don't care that he has 
the least amount of ability and could be replaced by a better (and committed) kid. The camps and 
open gym are wonderful opportunities for the kids, but they shouldn't place obligations on the coach. 

<p><b>Be prepared to justify your decisions</b>

<p>After all the soul searching and painful decisions are completed, your troubles may not be over. 
Be prepared for a challenged from a heart-broken parent. This is a very difficult situation because 
there is nothing you can say that will make a parent feel any better. All you can do is explain 
your process and say that you tried to be as fair as possible. Its OK to admit you're not perfect 
and that time may prove you could have made better choices, but at this time you feel you did the 
best you could. Keep this conversation as short as possible because the situation will not improve 
as it continues.

<p>DO NOT compare the parent's child with another player. Don't even talk about another player. 
The parent has a right to discuss their child, but no other.

<p>DO NOT add to your team roster just to appease a parent. If you do, your future teams will be 
populated with players who have the noisiest parents.

<p>Disappointed parents may go over your head. An administrator may approach you and ask about 
your tryout process. If you can show that your selection was based on a fair evaluation, you'll 
probably be staunchly supported.

<p>The cut players will like to know what they can do to better their chances next time. Again, 
you can't make them feel better, but you can suggest some things they can work on. Also, 
encourage them to stay active in sports. There are probably recreational venues where they 
can play basketball. Just don't make any promises. Its up to the kids to be good enough to make 
the team. 

<p><b>In summary ... </b></p>
<p>If you decide to keep a player based physical potential and cut a kid that has marginal potential 
but has displayed all the other characteristics you're looking for, make sure that the difference in 
the physical potential is dramatic. Otherwise, it isn't worth it. If the physically advantaged player 
is going to see few minutes anyway, you may have a happier season with the other player. It may 
come down to this question - which kid do you want to spend your season with?

      <p>by Steve MacKinney</p>
        
        <p>There is one ball and five players so on average, you spend 80% of the time on offense 
        playing without the ball.  While playing without the ball, you should try to accomplish 
        these things:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Get open under the basket</li>
        <li>Help a team mate get open under the basket</li>
        <li>Get open away from the basket</li>
        <li>Get a team mate open away from the basket</li>
        <li>Pull a defensive player away from the basket to open space for a teammate</li>
        <li>Create a mismatch of size, quickness, or ability by forcing the defense to switch</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Most of this chapter applies more to man-to-man defense than zones, but many of the 
        techniques will work against either defense.</p>

        open area where the passer can pass to you <i>(diagram 1)</i>. Give the passer a target by holding 
        your open hand out on the side away from your defender.  The passer should throw ahead of you 
        so you and the ball arrive at the spot at the same time.

        You should take two or three quick steps toward the basket to get the defender moving with 
        you.  Go all the way to the lane in case the passer thinks he can get the ball to you and 
        attempts the pass.  When you get close enough to the basket to be sure the passer is not going 
        to throw the ball, quickly plant your foot and cut back away from the basket to the spot where 
        you want to receive the pass. Give a target as explained above. Sometimes if the defender is 
        really close when you get ready to plant your foot and cut away for the pass, you can reverse 
        pivot into the defender and give him a little bump with your butt to keep him from staying with 
        you as you move out into the open.

        <p><b><a name="Back door cuts">Back door cuts</a></b> (or back cuts) <i>(diagram 3)</i>&nbsp; take advantage of a defender who is trying to keep you 
        from getting open.  Usually you will start the back cut by moving into open 
        space with a defender moving with you. To signal to the passer that you are going to back cut, 
        hold out a closed fist instead of an open hand as a target.  The passer should fake a pass to 
        you to try to get the defender to focus on the ball and lunge into the passing lane.  Plant 
        your outside foot (when facing the passer, the foot furthest from the basket) and quickly cut 
        toward the basket and look for a pass.  A bounce pass is usually best because the defender will 
        try to step back toward the lane to deflect the pass and a bounce pass will get under his hand. 
        If the passer is dribbling toward the cutter when the cutter starts his back cut, he can pass 
        with one hand (dribble pass) and put back spin on the ball so when it bounces, it slows and 
        bounces up making it easier for the receiver to catch. When receiving a back cut pass, expect 
        another defender to be coming to the basket and be ready to dish off to his man, fake the dish 
        and take the ball up yourself, or just go up strong and score anyway.

        <p><a name="Sealing (ducking in)"><b>Sealing (ducking in)</b></a> is effective close to the basket to keep the defender from 
        deflecting a pass to you.  You simply duck under the defender's arm which is denying the pass 
        to you. Step across in front of the defender and lean back on him and stick your elbow straight 
        out to the side so it blocks the defender from getting around in front of you. Stick your other 
        hand out and ask for the ball.  This is especially useful against zone defenses since the 
        defense is usually focused on the ball and playing in front of the receiver.
        
        <p>Another way to seal a defender is to move up to him face to face and then reverse pivot 
        into him and lean back on him. After setting a screen, try to seal the man you screened 
        by reverse pivoting in front of him when he tries to go around you. Then step toward the 
        basket keeping the defender behind you and ask for the ball.</p>

        <p><b>Screening - How to help team mates get open</b></p>
        
        <p>Unselfish players are just as happy to get their team mate open for a shot as they are 
        when they score themselves. Thank the player who got you open with a screen just as you 
        thank the passer after an assist. The irony of setting screens to get your teammates open 
        is that the screener is often the one who scores because the defense switches to cover the 
        cutter. Unselfish play and good communication is what makes the difference between being a 
        team and just being five players.</p>
        
        <p>Communication is important in screening just as it is when running a back door cut. 
        We use a raised fist to signal that we are going to set a screen. That keeps the passer 
        from bouncing the ball off the screener's face and lets the cutter know that he should 
        start running his man into the screen. You can also call out the name of the cutter as 
        you go to set a screen for him or point to where you want him to cut by you.
        
        <p><a name="Using a screen">Using a screen</a> is very effective for getting open and for creating mismatches by forcing 
        the defense to switch (the screener's defender covers the cutter so the cutter's defender 
        takes the screener - they "switch" men).  By having the smallest, quickest player screen 
        for the tallest player and forcing their defenders to switch, you can make their smallest 
        player defend your tallest one and force their tallest player to defend your quickest one.  
        Once they switch, stay spread out enough so it is hard for them to switch back.</p>
        
        <p>There are several kinds of screens you can use:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><a href="#Back screens">Back screen</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Down screens">Down screen</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Down screens">Ball screen</a> (pick)</li>
        <li><a href="#Horizontal screens">Horizontal screen</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Flare screen">Flare screen</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Double screen">Double screen</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Double screen">Staggered screen</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Double screen">Slip (fake) screen</a></li>
        <li><a href="#Yo-yo screen">Yo-yo screen</a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can also use:
        <ol>
        <li>Another cutter as a screen
        <li>Another player's defender as a screen
        <li>A post player who has the ball as a screen.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The technique is similar for most screens. You should look for the cutter's defender 
        (call him "CD") and get between him and the spot the cutter (C) is going to. Get as close 
        to CD as is legal - an inch if CD can see you, about 30 inches if CD cannot see you like 
        on a back screen. You (the screener) must be stopped when the contact takes place. Once 
        contact is made, you should be ready to reverse pivot whichever direction CD tries to go 
        around and seal CD behind you. Then you can step towards the basket looking for a pass.</p>
        
        <p>The cutter is responsible for influencing his defender (CD) into the screener, either 
        with fakes or subtle pushing with the back of his hand or his arm.  The cutter should go 
        very close to the screener (we tell them to rub shoulders) so CD cannot force his way 
        between them. He should continue his cut several steps past the screener to force the 
        screener's defender to go with him, leaving the screener open (if the screener is able 
        to seal CD).  The cutter will often get open against poor defensive teams and the screener 
        will get open against the better teams if he seals properly.</p>

      <p>Another way to use a cutter as a screen is to have a high post with the ball 
        and have a guard cut under him diagonally from the right guard position toward the left 
        baseline corner <i>(diagram 12)</i>. As the guard and his man go by, the post player drives 
        right and forces his man into the cutter or the cutter's defender.</p>

      <p>When a post player has the ball along the side of the lane or at the free throw line, 
        a cutter can start high and run his man into the post player by cutting above the post 
        and then continuing toward the basket <i>(diagram 13)</i>. If the defender tries to go under 
        the post, the cutter can stop and shoot from behind the post player. If the post player 
        is on the block, a player on the wing can "dive" down and run to the baseline side of the 
        post player and often be open when he comes out on the other side, but the post player 
        may get double-teamed by the cutter's defender and not be able to make the pass.</p>

        <p>When your defender is the "help" man and is playing off you to help defend under the 
        basket, you need to take advantage of it. Flashing (cutting toward the passer) 
        <i>diagram 14)</i> to the high post will usually allow you to catch and then pass inside 
        before the low post's defender can get around him to deny the pass. You can also do a 
        quick spin move from the high post and drive down across the lane for a lay up if your 
        defender tries to deny the pass on the low side because there is no help behind you.</p>
        
        <p>When a team mate drives and your man is going to help, step away from your man to give 
        the driver an open passing lane and get your hands ready to catch a bounce pass.</p>

        <p>When two offensive players stand too close to each other, it allows the defense to

        except when cutting and screening to spread the defense out and allow some space for 
        one-on-one moves.</p>
        <p><b>Spacing against full court pressure</b></p>
        <p>Most pressure defenses will try to double team the ball and cover the other four 
        offensive players with three defenders. If the offensive players are spread out, it is 
        harder for three defenders to cover them. If potential receivers are so far away from the 
        passer that he can't throw to them without a defender getting there first, they aren't 
        helping.  </p>

        out enough to make it hard for one defender to cover two men. Cutting toward the passer 
        and going to meet the pass keeps defenders from coming from behind to steal the pass. 
        Catching the ball in the middle of the floor gives you 360 degrees to pass to but the 
        sidelines only give you 180 degrees and the corner only gives you 90.  When you catch 
        in the middle, look to the opposite side because presses usually are moving toward the

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Chapter 5">Chapter 5 </a> - A Simple Little Offense to Beat The Zone</font></h3>

<p><b>by Ed Riley</b>

<p>Now that you understand more about tryouts,&nbsp;and moving without the
ball, it's time we gave you what some of you readers of the 
last book cried for - OFFENSE!! Basketball is more 
than just X's and O's, or plays. You will spend just as much energy and time 
dealing with the personal and emotional side of the game, like tryouts. But 
it is basketball season and right now you might need a little OFFENSE in 
your life. So we will have a chapter or two on the people side. Then, out of 
nowhere, faster than a speeding bullet, WHAM....the next chapter might give 
you an offense or a defense that you can teach your players in their next 
LS. Is this book disjointed? No! We just want to keep you on your toes. So let's talk a little O = OFFENSE. 

<p>I have to keep reminding myself that this book is for 2nd year coaches. When 
you have a child that plays ball,  and you coach their team, you tend to 
think in terms of that particular age group. So if I seem like I'm going too 
fast, that's why.

<p>As most of you found out in your first year of coaching, most of your 
opponents played some form of a zone defense, right? Right! So this is where 
I am going to help you gut the next team that throws a zone at you. And 
... it's too simple!

<p>Have you taught your players how to set a solid screen that seals? If you 
have, then move on because this offense is for you. If your team's not good 
at it yet, then hold off on this offense until they are good at setting 
screens that seal. OK, let's move on.

<p>If you have one of those diagram boards that you can use with a dry erase 
marker, then go get it. If you don't have one, then grab paper and pen. Now 
draw a halfcourt with the paint, the free throw line, the blocks, and the hash
marks all on it. 

<p>I'm going to have you draw a little play. When I tell you where a forward 
goes, just write a big "F" in that spot. When I tell you where a  guard goes, 
just place a big "G" in that spot. Use the letter X for the defensive players.

<ol>
<li>Set up your defensive X's in a 2-3 zone. Put an X on each elbow where the
  free&nbsp; thow line meets the sides of the paint. Now put an X on each block, and an 
X in between the X's on each block. This should look like a 2-3 zone. If it 
doesn't, then rearrange your X's until they do line up this way.</li>

<li>Place an <b>F</b> outside of the X that is on the right block. The X should be 
between the <b>F</b> and the basket. Now you have their defensive player right in 
front of your forward.</li>

<li>Place another <b>F</b> right beside your first <b>F</b>. Now you have 2 forwards facing 
their one defensive player.</li>

<li>Place a <b>FS</b> in back of your first two <b>F</b>'s.  It should look like two 
linebackers guarding the quarterback from the defensive player. </li>

<li>Place a <b>G</b> on the right hand side of the court between the freethrow line 
and the 3 point line. This guard has the ball.</li>

<li>Place a <b>G</b> on the left side of the court directly opposite where you put 
the other guard on the right side of the court.</li>

<li>Your guard with the ball passes to your <b>FS</b> = forward shooter. The 2 
forwards in front of your <b>FS</b> screens the defensive player and your <b>FS</b> has a 
free shot from about 10' out.<br><br>

<i><b>TIMEOUT......</b>Plays are not designed to put the ball in the hole. Plays are 
designed to get you player open for a clean shot. Your player still has to 
make the basket in order to score. Alright, back to the offense.</i></li><br><br>

<li>Once the defensive player figures this out, and sometimes that takes a 
long while, then they will try to fight through your double screen to get to 
the shooter. When they do get through, have your <b>FS</b> lob a 4' pass over the 
defender's head to one of your two <b>F</b>'s. The <b>F</b> with the ball then pivots and 
takes the 6' shot. Sometimes have your 2 <b>F</b>'s let the defender through so you 
can lob it for an even closer shot.</li>

<li>Once the defense figures this out, then switch sides and now do it on 
the opposite side of the basket. The defender on that side will go through 
the same slow learning process that the last defender went through. You will 
get 5 to 8 shots off before they finally figure it out.</li>

<li>Once both defensive sides have it figured out, then you go with your 
next option. Remember the guard who never had the ball, who was on the 
opposite side of the court as the ball? Now they come into play. When the 
defense finally figures out you are overloading a side, the other 2 defensive 
forwards will move toward your overload to help cover that little lob pass of 
yours. When they do this, your <b>FS</b> throws the ball to the open guard on the 
other side of the court, and they will normally have a nice 10' shot waiting 
for them.</li>

<li>Once the defense figures out your passing to the open guard, then they 
won't move to help against the lob pass. This let's you go back to your 
original overload or lob pass.</li>

<li>Younger teams have such a hard time with this offense, that it's flat out 
scary. In fact, my girls just got back from playing a tournament in Las 
Vegas. This was our major offense every time the other teams played a zone 
against us. Guess what? Most of the teams we played against played a zone, 
and we won the tournament with this offense. So it is an offense you can use 
against older teams as well. </li>

<li>Don't quite understand it? Draw your diagram and use dimes as your guards and 
quarters as your forwards and nickles as your defenders. Keep reading this 
while you are moving your players into their designated spots. Now keep 
moving your players until it makes sense. </li></ol>

<p>Let's call this offense The Overload. Let's remember, the overload is only to 
be played against zone offenses.</p>

<p><b>by Steve Jordan</b>

<p>Just a few comments to add to Ed's discussion on zone offense:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Learning complicated patterns will consume a huge chunk of precious practice time.</li>
  <li>Inexperienced players will have trouble concentrating on patterns during the game.</li>
  <li>Complex plays break down easily. Sometimes one mistake by one player can throw the
    entire team into confusion or disarray.</li>
  <li>If the offensive play is too difficult, the kids will just stop trying to run it.</li>
  <li>When trying to run a complex pattern, the kids work so hard at following the play, they
    miss the open shots that are created during the process.</li>
</ol>

<p>You are welcome to any of the diagrammed, b<a href="easyplays.html">asic plays
i</a>n the Coach's Notebook. 
These plays were designed when I coached 6th-8th grade team in YMCA ball and I find 
they still work well in 9th-10th grade high school competition. There is nothing wrong with 
simplicity. In fact, there is far greater value in performing simple skills well rather than 
complicated skills poorly. Choose plays that can be learned and mastered quickly. The players 
will be more successful and have alot more fun.</p></b>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Chapter 6">Chapter 6 </a> - Junk man, Junk bonds, Junk mail, ... Junk Defenses??</font></h3>
<p><i>by Ed Riley</i></p>

<p>Conventional...Traditional...Status Quo...Regular...Normal...these are all 
words that describe the defenses that most experienced coaches use. These 
defenses' names read like something a rocket scientist might use, or that 
James Bond might use as a secret code: 1-3-1, 2-1-2, 1-2-2, 1-2-1-1, see what 
I mean?</p>

<p>In the last 20 years there's been a new phenomena occurring. Remember when 
you first started coaching, how hard it was to find material that actually 
helps the first year coach? Because of this, a lot of younger coaches started 
making up their own defenses. So what do the older more experienced coaches 
call these defenses, JUNK DEFENSES. And what do the older coaches tend to 
think of these defenses? That they live up to their name, of course.</p>

<p>I fit right in with a lot of the older coaches, (no ole fart jokes now), 
because I preach that you need to stay with man-2-man 99% of the time. I'm 
not a big advocate of using junk  defenses a lot. But, there is a time and a 
place for everything, even junk defenses. And ...... wouldn't today's 
traditional defenses be considered junk defenses when they first came on the 
scene? </p>

<p>Here's a little story to illustrate my point, and it may not be exactly 
correct, but it will be close enough. There once was a college coach who 
wanted to win the NCAA tournament. He was going to be playing some teams that 
each had an almost unstoppable superstar on their team. If he went m-2-m, his 
players weren't good enough to stop them. If he went with a zone, his team 
would get beat because of the great outside shooting on these superstars. The 
situation seemed hopeless.</p>

<p>So what did the coach do? He went into his little red office, grabbed his 
little red notebook, and started drawing junk defenses with his little red 
pen. After 40 days and 40 knights, (only kidding)! he came up with a new 
defense, it was dubbed the Box-and-1. And with that brand new "Junk" defense, 
Coach Bobby Knight won a national championship tournament. Coach Knight, if I 
totally screwed up the story, please don't see red, because that was how it 
was described to me, sort of!</p>

<p>The point is that the Box-and-1 is now considered a traditional defense, to a 
point. You don't use it every game, you use it when you come up against a 
team that has a player that you just can't stop. Just as there is a place for 
the Box-and-1, I'm sure that the rest of these "Junk" defenses may have merit 
as well. So guess what Ima gonna do? Ima gonna give you my version of my own 
junk defense, I call it the Diamond-and-1. I liked the idea of the Box-and-1, 
but it just didn't work well for my team, so I changed it slightly. For me to 
explain it to you, I have to give you an over view of the Box-and-1 first.</p>

<p><b>THE BOX-AND-1 DEFENSE, SIMPLIFIED</p></b>
<ol>
<li>Put a forward on each block</li>

<li>Put 2 of your remaining players on each elbow = on each corner of the 
free-throw line</li>

<li>These four players play a zone, each covering a five foot or so area 
around where they are standing.</li>

<li>Take your best defensive player, and they cover the other team's 
superstar, man-2-man.</li>
</ol>

<p>The purpose of this defense is that no matter where the superstar goes, they 
are guarded by the one player who is playing m-2-m against them. And, they 
are also guarded by the person whose zone they invade. So whenever they are 
playing half court offense, they effectively have 2 people guarding them. </p>

<p>Now my problem with this is that with a person on each block and one on each 
elbow, someone can drive right down the middle into the paint and shoot. So I 
took the Box-and-1 and changed it a little, and it works for me.</p>

<p><b>THE DIAMOND-AND-1 DEFENSE</p></b>
<ol>

<li>Place a guard in the middle of the free throw line.</li>

<li>Place a forward halfway between the block and the elbow, on each side of 
the paint.</li>

<li>Place a forward in the middle of the paint about 3 feet in front of the 
basket.</li>

<li>When these four players are in the proper position, they form a diamond, 
and play their zone.</li>

<li>Make your best defensive player play m-2-m against the other team's 
superstar.</li>
</ol>

<p>With this defense, you accomplish the same as you do with a Box-and-1, except 
now someone has to go through 2 of your players in order to drive down the 
middle of the paint. Folks, pay attention now, only use this defense when it 
is obvious your team cannot stop an opposing player from scoring. So there 
you have it, my favorite junk defense. </p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Chapter 7">Chapter 7</a> - Beating the Junk Defense</font></h3>
    
<p><i>by Steve Jordan, Coach's Notebook</i></p>

<p>Junk defenses can really stymie a young team if they are 
not well grounded in dealing with zone defense. Some of the more common questions
    received by the Coach's Notebook and seen in various coaching bulletin boards concern
    tactics to use against &quot;junk&quot; zone defensive formations. The questions usually
    pertain to the 1-3-1, Box and 1 and Triangle &amp; 2 zones. These defensive configurations
    can appear confusing even to an experienced team if they are being seen for the first
    time. For more information on conventional defenses, please see my articles, &quot;<a href="man2man.html">Basic
    Man to Man</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="Pressurem2m.html">Pressure Man to Man</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="zone.html">Basic Zone</a>&quot;.</p>
    <p>The thing to remember is that all zones are compromises. To compromise means that one
    is willing to give up something in order to gain something else. People play zones to
    protect or hide players, or to constrain the defensive extension. What is given up is the
    individual responsibility inherent in a man to man defense. Zone responsibilities are
    about guarding an area rather than a particular player.</p>
    <p>Junk zone defenses are often labeled as gimmicks. They are attempts to recover some of
    the advantages lost in the compromise of playing zone, so the junk defense is more like a
    hybrid of both zone and man to man. An optimistic coach will claim that the benefit is
    attaining the best of both worlds. I prefer to think that the junk defense is
    actually a compromise of a compromise, and therefore a weakened dilution of the basic zone defense.</p>
    <p>Discussed in this article is the Box and 1 defense because that's what my
    buddy, Ed Riley, described above. If you
    run into a new variation, take minute and sketch it out on paper. The principles applied
    here will work against other formations. You may need to align the players a little
    differently to start the offense.</p>
    <h3><b>Fundamental Ways to Beat a Zone</b></h3>
    <p>To beat the gimmick defense, you must understand how to play against a zone. Breaking
    down a zone defense can be summed up in a few simple steps:<ol>
      <li><strong>Push the ball up the court as quickly as you can</strong> and still control the
        action. If the offense beats the defense down the floor, the zone will not have time to
        set up and open shots may present themselves with nothing more than fundamental two man
        plays.</li>
      <li><strong>Place players in open areas</strong>. If the defense has two guards on top,
        counter with three. For example, the defense shows a 2-3 zone, you counter with a classic
        1-2-2 with a point guard, two wings and two posts.&nbsp; If the defense has three people
        out front, like in a 3-2, counter with 2-1-2 where you have a post man on the free throw
        line. </li>
      <li><b>Overload the zone.</b> Just because the defensive players are guarding
        areas doesn't mean the offensive players must play in certain areas. Put four players on
        one side of the floor. The zone will not have adequate coverage on that strong side.</li>
      <li>If the zone is set up, <strong>make the defense MOVE</strong>. There are two basic ways
        to do this. One, attempt to drive between two defensive players. They will be forced to
        close the gap. For a moment you will have two defenders on the ball. Someone nearby will
        be open. Two, use short, quick passes. The defense will not be able to keep up as the ball
        moves from side to side. If you have an overload situation, someone will soon be open for
        a shot.</li>
    </ol>

            <p>The Box and 1 will devote a defender to your best scorer
    (B1). The other four opponents will play zone, usually in a box formation (diagram #1). B1
    will need to best both his man and the zone to get a drive at the basket.<br>

it is that's nagging at you. 
 
<p>That's where I am at the moment, so bear with me while I try to verbalize 
this current idea. Because I myself am so simple, I like to boil things down 
to their simplest form. I believe that this one chapter, if I do it right, 
can help you and me more than anything else I have ever written. Of course, I 
also invented the laser, penicillin, and coached the winning team in the NCAA 
tourney for the last 10 years in a row, ar, ar!!!!! 
 
<p>Ever heard of good ole common horse sense? How about common sense? Well, I
am going to talk about basketball sense, and lack there of. The biggest problem 
I see with today's teams is lack of good ole fashioned basketball sense. 
Let's not restrict this just to the teams, let's include most of the youth 
coaches in this group as well. So what is basketball sense? 
<ol>
<li>If common sense is bringing water with you on your trek in the desert, 
then basketball sense is having your players bring a water bottle with them 
to the game. Why? Ever try talking to your players at half-time when they are 
all standing in line at the water fountain? As they say in the country,
&quot;That 
dawg just won't hunt!&quot; </li>

<li>If common sense is coming in out of the rain, then basketball sense is 
yelling for the ball when you are open under the basket. Ever had a player 
wide open under the basket and quietly wait, hoping their fellow player with 
the ball would see them? Yeah, me too! </li>
 
<li>If common sense is looking before you cross the road, basketball sense is 
dribbling with your head up. How can your player make sure their boyfriend or 
girlfriend isn't flirting in the stands with some else, if they dribble with 
their head down. Besides, as a coach I'm sure you check the gym floor for 
potholes before every game, don't you? No? You always want to check for 
potholes just so your team won't have to worry about falling into one, JUST 
IN CASE&nbsp; they try dribbling with their head up. </li>
 
<li>If common sense tells you to wear a coat when it's cold outside, 
basketball sense tells you that you have to move to get open for a pass when 
you want the ball. Well OK, if your player takes their invisible pill, maybe 
they don't have to move. But, I heard that one of the side effects of the 
invisible pills is that they make you belch. If that is indeed the case, then 
maybe you would still have to move to get open. </li>
 
<li>If common sense tells you not to dive headfirst into 2 feet of water, then 
basketball sense tells you that on offense, you shouldn't bring your sleeping 
bag, tent, barbecue grill, and CD player, and pitch camp in the 3 second 
area, the paint. Heck, it's hard enough to get that tent set up in the paint 
in just 3 seconds, let alone cook the shrimp on the Barbie in that time 
frame. </li>
 
<li>If common sense tells you not to run that red light while driving, then 
basketball sense tells you not to try to dribble through 3 defensive players. 
Unless......you really need to use the restroom that badly. </li>
 
<li>If common sense tells you not to stick your hand into the fire, then 
basketball sense tells you that reaching in to steal a ball normally gets 
your wrist slapped, or at least a foul. Wanna have some fun? Teach your team 
not to slap, hack, or reach in to try to steal the ball. Instead, teach them 
to time the offensive player's dribble and try to slap the ball up. It's hard 
to foul when you slap the ball upward into the dribbler. And watch what 
happens to the dribbler, talk about throwing a player totally out of their 
rhythm, it can be quite humorous. </li>
 
<li>If common sense tells you not to jump off of the bridge, basketball sense 
tells you that when throwing the ball in bounds, don't you step in bounds 
until you do throw it in. </li>
 
<li>If common sense tells you not to pick on a giant who is 2 feet taller than 
you and outweighs you by 100 pounds, basketball sense tells you not to have 
your shortest player guard their tallest player. </li>
 
<p>I can't resist, I have to tell you a short story related to #9. My point 
guard is only about 4'10. It is not totally unheard of for her to end up 
guarding another team's forward for a few moments, due to switching of 
players because of screens. 
 
<p>In a game, my PG - point guard, was screened by a 6'3&quot; center. Our other 
player yelled switch, so now 4'10&quot; PG had to guard 6'3&quot; Giant . Off
course, 
the other team just had to pass it to Giant, who was about 12' from the 
basket. 
 
<p>It was obvious that Giant didn't feel comfortable dribbling or shooting from 
that distance, so she just held the ball above her head. 
 
<p>All PG could see was the ball, so she jumped up trying to knock the ball out 
of Giant's hands. With the height difference, PG couldn't jump any higher 
than Giant's shoulders. Now PG never would admit she was short, and because 
of this - she played tall. At 4'10", she was still my best 3 point shooter
on the team. 
 
<p>Anyway, here Giant is holding the ball above her head and PG is just jumping 
and jumping, trying to get high enough to get the ball. It was so absurd a 
sight, that everyone started chuckling. 
 
<p>Finally, PG stopped jumping, stared at Giant, and hauled off and kicked the 
Giant in the shin as hard as she could. The ref immediately blew his whistle 
for the foul. PG raised her hand in the air admitting guilt. Then she turned 
to the ref and said, &quot;If you'd called a 5 second call like you should of, I 
wouldn't have kicked her.&quot; With that, she stormed back to the bench. 
 
<p>No, I don't condone this behavior, but it was kinda funny. All right, let's 
get back to work. </p>
 
<li>If common sense tells you not to spit into the wind, then basketball 
sense tells you not to scream at or curse out a ref, for too long.
Remember, most games are won or lost on the free throw line. </li>
 
<li>Basketball sense tells you to pass slightly in front of the person 
running down the court on the fast break. Have you ever wondered what your 
passer is thinking, when they pass the ball and it hits the receiver in the 
back of their ankle, and trips them? I've wondered this on several different 
occasions. </li>
 
<li>This is personally one of my favorites. Basketball sense says not to get 
hit in the back of the head with the ball, when guarding a player on a fast 
break. Rather, you should look to intercept the pass. </li>
</ol> 
<p>Have you ever watched the other team rebound under your basket and throw a 
long baseball pass down the court on a fast break? All the time, right? Well, 
how about when your defensive player is right behind the intended receiver, 
and never looks at anything except their player. Then WHAM, the baseball pass 
hits your player in the back of the head. </p>
 
<p>Or, even worse, your player can tell the pass is coming, so they stop and 
cover their head with both hands. In the meantime, the other player catches 
the pass and goes for a lay-up before your player uncovers their head. <i>If you
have never seen this, wait a while, you will!</i> </p>
 
<p>In an effort to make these chapters short enough for easy reading, (and 
because my daughter is calling), I'll end this chapter here. Remember there 
are more chapters to come, so keep check this site for the next installment.

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Chapter 9">Chapter 9</a> - Someone Is Selling Something To Somebody All Of The Time</font></h3>
<p><i>by Ed Riley</i></p>

<p>A word of advice to all of you would be writers, DON'T FOLLOW MY LEAD. Go 
with shorter titles where you don't have to capitalize a lot, (typer's 
cramp). Anyway, I am sure that this title will raise a couple of eyebrows. 
Yes, folks, this is where I am going to sell you something, an idea.
 
<p>I have this innate belief that life consists of a series of little and big 
sales. Let's take jobs for instance. A lawyer sells himself to his client, 
and then sells his client to the judge, jury, etc. A doctor sells his 
expertise. Think not? Look in the yellow pages under physicians, they 
advertise themselves. The assembly line worker sold his employer on his 
abilities to get the job done. In fact, every job interview is nothing more 
than an individual selling a potential employer on their own abilities. Other 
examples? How about a discussion? Isn't someone normally selling their 
perspective to the other person? </p>

<p>OK, ED, ENOUGH ABOUT SELLING, ALL RIGHT???  So what does this have to do with 
coaching basketball? Everything, is the correct answer. Here's an example of 
why. I get a lot of e-mails from you folks asking for help with this 
situation or that. The following is an e-mail I received from one of you 
folks. Read it, figure out how you would solve the problem this coach has, 
and then read on. The background is this: You have a mom, who was a 
basketball player herself,  and is now coaching her son's 4th grade team. The 
rest I will let you read in her own words. </p>

<p>"Hey, Ed! Where are you and how quick can you get to Arkansas?

<p>We scrimmaged the 5th graders last night, got beat 38 to 4.  But I played 
all the players and this was their first ever game/scrimmage. </p>

<p>Now I have practice tonight and need to go over some plays.  They never took 
the time to slow down and do anything last night.  It was constant running 
back and forth up and down the court.  Any suggestions? 
We have a game Saturday AM........ </p>
<p>HELP!!!!HELP!!!!!HELP!!!!!HELP!!!!!HELP!!!!!HELP!!!!HELP!!!!!" </p>

<p>Got the picture? Her 4th graders played against experienced and bigger 5th 
graders. Now walk away from your computer and take a short break. Seriously 
think about what you would recommend to her. While you are thinking about 
this, I am going to go take a quick smoke break. (Yes, I have the ultimate 
nasty habit, and I love it.) </p>

<p>Glad to have you back. I am sure you have solved the problems of the universe 
for this coach right? Well, here is my e-mail response to this coach. LET'S 
SEE HOW CLOSE YOU AND I CAME TO HAVING THE SAME ANSWER. </p>

<p>"I wanted to see you play against an older and bigger team, and you boys did 
great. I know you may not think you did so good, but you scored 4 points 
against an older team. This Saturday when you play a team your own age and 
your own size, it should be a lot more fun. If you can play the older boys, 
you can beat the ones your own age. </p>

<p>Karen, it's time to turn the negative into a positive, motivate your guys." </p>

<p>What exactly did I suggest for her to do? Nothing more than to sell her 
players on the fact that they should feel good about what they accomplished. 
I even e-mailed her that silly little speech. A coach motivates, right? 
Motivation is nothing more than selling someone on an idea. This coach can 
throw up because of nerves, or she can try to turn the negative into a 
positive. Coaching is selling. </p>

<p>So let's look at some other ways coaches sell. How about teaching your 
players a drill, or a move, or an actual play with X's and O's, isn't this 
selling? Have you ever tried to teach your team a play, and watch them 
butcher even the simplest of moves? It's at these times when you begin to 
wonder if anyone on your team is bright enough to chew gum and tie their 
shoes at the same time. Wanna know why they aren't getting it? It's because 
they aren't sold on it!!!  It doesn't take a kid long to learn something that 
they think is cool or fun. This is because they are sold on the idea. It 
takes a team forever to learn a play if they aren't sold on it. </p>

<p>I just opened up a basketball academy here in St. Louis. We teach kids how to 
play. Our goal is to teach these kids enough to be able to make their high 
school team. We have 6 hours a week of  LS's and we play very few games at 
the moment, like none. For a kid, this has to be boring. So how did I get 60 
girls to pay me to bore them to tears? First, I sold them on an idea that I 
could teach them enough to give them a shot at making their high school team. 
Second, I sold them on the idea that they are an extremely select group of 
warriors learning how to do battle. Last, I sold them on the idea that I 
could make LS's fun without playing a game for a while. </p>

<p>Here is a wonderful use of Ed's version of the English language. A definition 
of "Coach" means coach, a form of the verb "Coax." To coax, to sell! How's that 
for abusing the English language? I hope you get the idea. To maximize every 
situation, try turning the negative into the positive.</p> 

<p>I once had a 4th grader who wasn't wrapped too tight. OK, I'll be honest, she 
was flat out mentally slow. She would believe everything I told her. One time 
 before a game, she couldn't make a shot during warm-ups to save her soul. I 
mean she couldn't even hit the backboard. So I went up to her and told her, 
"You know, you can only miss so many shots in one day. After that they all 
have to go in. But you need to be careful because you can only make so many 
in a day before you have to miss all of the rest of them. So you keep on 
missing them in warm-ups like this, and you'll probably make every basket in 
the game." I then turned and walked away. This girl didn't want to quit 
shooting even when the horn blew for her to go to her bench for the start of 
the game. </p>
 
<p>She only took 5 shots that night, but she made four of them. After the game 
she came up to me with a real long face and said, "Coach, I'm sorry! If I had 
missed one or two more before the game, maybe I would have made that last 
basket in the game. I shot as much as I could before the game, I just ran out 
of time." </p>

<p>Someone is going to sell something to somebody, all of the time. Either you 
are going to sell them on your ideas, or they are going to sell you on 
theirs. You're big, they're small. You are educated, they're not. You are 
experienced, they're not. You are an adult, they're just kids. So how come 
they win most of the time? Because they are better at selling than we are. 
Now you know their secret, beat them at their own game. Sell them on why they 
should learn this drill, or that play, or whatever. </p>

<p>Don't forget, according to Ed's basketball dictionary, coach is a derivative 
of the verb "to coax, meaning to sell." So you can try to dictator your way 
through your teaching of drills and plays, or you can try coaxoaching your 
way through them. By the way, I think I'll keep that word - coaxoaching. 
According to Ed's basketball dictionary, coaxoaching is the act of a coach 
selling their team , individual player, or even the player's parents on an 
idea, drill, play, or wanted type of behavior through the use of words, 
verbal tone, or outright bribery. Folks, I'm not proud, I can bribe with the 
best of them. Sometimes a dollar candy bar saves you a $100 worth of 
headaches. </p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Chapter 10">Chapter 10</a>  ......   Survivor Ain't Got Nuttin On Us!</font></h3>
<p><i>by Ed Riley copyright 2001</i></p>

<p>I am a relatively outgoing insane, type of fella. Add to that, that my wife 
has never met anyone but a friend. Add to that, that according to my girls, 
my was wife has that rare disease called talkalotis, pronounced 
talk-a-lot-is. With all of this going for me, it was inevitable that in my 
first year of coaching, I would get to know and become friends with every 
coach in our league. I met 14 brand new coaches the year I started coaching. 

<p>I hope you really, really enjoyed your first year because that is quite 
possibly the best year there is. Remember the one player of yours that didn't 
make a basket for the longest time? I had one that didn't make a basket until 
the last game of her first year. Do you remember their face when they made 
that first basket? They had a smile wrapped around both ears and you could 
see every tooth they were missing from across the gym. That's the stuff that 
coaching memories are made of. That's also the reason why all 14 of the first 
time coaches I met decided to stick with it and coach their team the next 
year as well.

<p>AS YOU CAN TELL, ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL, RIGHT? ....... WRONG ...... Ever 
wonder why I named this book "Surviving Your Second Year?"  Out of the 
fourteen perfectly happy first year coaches, only 6 survived to coach their 
third year. So, six coaches quit at the end of year two and two more quit in 
the middle of the season. 

<p>We tend to give nicknames to the different ages. We have the Dark Ages, the 
age of the Industrial Revolution, medieval ages, the Age of Enlightenment, 
and more. Let's look at our own children. When they are one year old, we call 
it the Wondrous Ones. So what do we call it when they turn two, do you 
remember? We call it the TERRIBLE TWOS. We all know this term and have 
probably said it about our own kids. The Terrible Twos apply to coaching as 
well. During my first year of coaching I visited my local watering hole 
infrequently. During my second year, I was an infrequent Regular. I made and 
lost my first gazillion because I invested in Absolute, in more ways than one.

<p><b>Here is my Top 7 List of Things to Watch For During Year 2</b></p>
<p>7. First year players are cute and precious. There is nothing cute about a 
second year player.
<p>6. Your player's parents have had a whole year to build up their expectations 
of what they think their own kid ought to be able to do. If their child 
doesn't live up to those expectations, it's the coach's fault.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. The "Parents From Hell" surface. Year one was the Age of Innocence = The 
parents are excited if their kid gets equal playing time and occasionally 
scores. You will hear a lot of wonderful ouuuh's and aaah's in your first 
year. Year two is "Why isn't my Johnny playing more than little Jimmy?" "Why 
aren't you sticking up for Johnny with that ref? My kid never touched that 
other kid, let alone foul them."&nbsp;</p>
<p> 4.  Your players and their parents have had a year to watch a little NBA on 
TV. Now try getting them to stick to the basics in your Learning Sessions, 
yeah, right!&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The "Parents Form Hell" now believe they know more than you and are not 
afraid to let you, and everyone else in the world, know that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Ear boogers! We all know what nose boogers are.  Old men with lots of 
nasal hair have them. Most of us know what lip boogers are. They are the 
dried up crud you get in the corners of your mouth. An eye booger is the 
sleep crud in the corner of your eyes when you first wake up. But ear 
boogers? An ear booger is the visible or invisible crud that second year 
players get in their ears that prevent them from hearing anything you have to 
say. Ear boogers are scary things, and they are contagious. One player gets 
ear boogers, next thing you know, the whole team's come down with a major 
case of the ear boogers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

1. OK gang, now do a drum roll on your computer desk as you read the number #1 
thing to watch for, during your second year of coaching ....... AND,  #1 on 
the list is TIME. Time, you say to yourself, Yes, Time! It has been 9 months 
since you last coached these kids. THEY HAVE HAD NINE MONTHS TO FORGET 
EVERYTHING YOU TAUGHT THEM LAST YEAR. Sometimes we have to control our own 
expectations and frustrations. Please don't bet that your kids can do even 
half of the things they could last year, because you'd lose.  In the 
beginning of your second year, just get used to the idea that you have to 
start from scratch.</p>

<p>So now let's see if I can make the glass half-full again rather than 
half-empty. As I have stated many times in the past, I would rather solve a 
problem before it becomes a problem. I have just listed seven major areas of 
concern for you second year coaches. Now let's solve these problems one by 
one.

<p>7. 2nd year players aren't cute. I started treating my girls as 
responsible adults in 5th grade. This was the first year I had my players 
sign an Expectation contract. If a player couldn't make it to an LS or a 
game, the player had to call me and tell me why not. Parents were not allowed 
to call and make excuses. Playing time was equal as long as attendance and 
great positive attitudes existed. Screw up, and your playing time was reduced.&nbsp;

<p>6. Parents expectations and their subsequent actions were curtailed 
dramatically with the introduction and enforcement of the Expectation 
contract. This was the first year that I gave out homework. I.E., work on 
left handed dribbling, shoot 100 free throws before the next LS, etc. If I had 
a parent with unusually high expectations, then I asked the parents to sign 
off that their child had actually done their homework. When they realized 
that their child wasn't doing their homework, then how can it be the coach's 
fault? All of these things can help you in your second year.&nbsp;

<p>5. "Parents From Hell" can be greatly reduced by the having your 
Expectation contract signed and enforced. The next way to help solve this is 
by what I call the "One Minute Mis-manager."  When I first started coaching, 
I would take forever to explain something to a parent, or even to a player. 
By doing this I not only missed the boat, I missed the taxi to the boat. 

<p>Most kids have a very short attention span. If it takes longer than a minute 
to explain something, you've lost them. Also make sure you explain it like 
you would to a four year old, so there is no chance for them to misunderstand 
what you are saying.

<p>So it's time to apply my One Minute Mis-manager to the parents. I do 
everything in my power to limit my parent conversations to one minute as 
well. The shorter the conversations, the less time they have to whine, yell, 
or scream at you. Another helping hand is when you forbid your players to 
have their parents call you about being late, missing LS's, or missing a 
game. Parents can't work you unless they are talking to you. Another aide in 
this battle is e-mail. I try to do 90% of all communications outside of our 
LS's by e-mail. And, I never let a parent say a word during an LS. Combine 
all of these and you reduce the chances of a "Parent From Hell" catching you.

<p>4. Being influenced by ESPN is easy to rectify. Without their parents to 
support their potential Hot Dog, non-fundamentally sound skills behavior, 
most potential showoffs will settle back down and follow your direction, 
especially when they are faced with suicides as an alternative.

<p>3. Refer back to #5 for the solution to "wanna-be coach parents".

<p>2. Ear boogers are tricky things. If you have a kid who won't listen, hand 
them a phone and tell them to call their parents to come and get them. They 
can explain to their parents why. Then tell them to bring back a doctor's 
excuse verifying they have an incurable case of ear boogers. Without this 
excuse, they are not allowed to come back until they apologize to you and the 
whole team for disrupting the LS. Also cutting playing time works.

<p>1. To have nine months to forget what you already taught them once is a 
hard one. You need patience, lots and lots of patience. They will relearn 
everything relatively quickly. Just don't expect a lot immediately and you 
won't be disappointed.

<p>Folks, my job is to help you survive your second year. It's the personal side 
of the game that gets to you and makes you crazy. You have all heard of the 
term "nuts and bolts." Drills and X's and O's are the "bolts." The personal 
side of the game is the "nuts," short for nutso. I hope these seven steps to 
survival helps. Now lets go on to the next chapter and deal with some bolts. 

<p>Remember there are more chapters to come. As always, e-mail me at 
firepow55@aol.com if you have any questions.</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Chapter 11">Chapter 11 Lost In Space</a></font></h3> 

<p>Let's play a little guessing game. I give you the clues, and you tell me who 
I am or what I am talking about. Remember, basketball is a game and games are 
supposed to be fun. So, if I extrapolate from there, (big 50 cent word for 
me, huh?) then basketball books should be a little fun as well, right? OK, so 
here we go. </p>

<p><b>Clue #1</b> Intruder alert! Intruder alert! </p>

<p><b>Clue #2</b> Who is quicker, me or them? </p>

<p><b>Clue #3</b> What do Fred Astaire, a young John Travolta, Julia Stiles, N'Sync, 
and you have in common? </p>

<p><b>Clue #4</b> "I once caught a fish, this big," is a line and a scene from the 
movie "DAVE." It's what Kevin Kleine was doing when he said this. </p>

<p><b>Clue #5</b> It's a basketball quote, "When everything else fails, you still 
have your _______? </p>

<p>OK, stop! Scroll back up and take your worst guesses, then scroll back down 
to here. OK, the answers are: </p>

<p>Got it, or give up? I'm talking about DEFENSE. </p>

<p><b>Clue #1</b> is when you take the court you need to feel like you own that court. 
So when the other team takes the court, they are invading your home, 
thus...Intruder Alert! </p>

<p><b>Clue #2</b> about who's quicker, has to do with spacing. </p>

<p><b>Clue #3</b> had to do with footwork, thus dancers. </p>

<p><b>Clue #4</b> has Kevin Kline spreading out his mechanical arms as far as they 
would spread. On defense you have to keep your hands up. </p>

<p><b>Clue #5</b> is "When everything else fails, you still have your DEFENSE." </p>

<p>Defense is all about spacing, footwork, keeping your hands up and out, and 
attitude. Maybe the hardest part for someone to understand is the spacing, so 
let's tackle that first. </p>

<p><b>Lost In Space</b></p>

<p>One of the first things a defensive player needs to figure out in a game is, 
is the player you are guarding quicker than you are? The answer to this, 
determines how far away from your opponent you play. </p>

<p><b>In Your Face Defense</b></p>

<p>Let's assume that you know for a fact that you are much quicker than your 
opponent, and that they have the ball. Then you play "In Your Face Defense," 
or IYFD. This means that you are always within one arm's length of your 
player when they have the ball. If they fake you out away from the basket, 
then you should be quick enough to catch up with them and still stop them. </p>

<p>I tell my girls in this situation that I want them closer enough to smell the 
other player's breath. My girls gave me that Eewww, gross! look when I said 
this the first time. But, they soon learned what I meant by that. Now they 
make jokes about what the other players had for lunch. </p>

<p><b>You're Quick - I'm Smarter Defense </b></p>

<p>When the player you are guarding has the ball and is quicker than you, then 
your spacing is not IYFD. If they are 15' or more away from the basket, then 
be at least two arm lengths away from the quick player you are guarding. If 
they start to drive on you, this spacing gives you more of a chance to stay 
with them on defense. </p>

<p>My daughter is a great example of this. Crash is 5'9" and 155 lbs. (She used 
to be 177 lbs.) At 5'9" and 155 lbs., you wouldn't think of her as being 
quick enough to be a defensive whiz. If she isn't the best defensive player 
on my team, then I don't know who is. This girl is just as good against a 
super quick guard, as she is against a wide body forward. Why? She has spacing 
down to a science. </p>

<p>I'm not trying to brag, I'm trying to make a point. And Crash is my "Crash 
Dummy". If a wide body player with average speed can guard a super quick 
guard, simply because of spacing, then we all need to take a serious look at 
this. </p>

<p>When Crash is guarding a "Superstar" guard who has the ball, Crash will play 
as many as 3 arm lengths away from the girl. As the girl approaches the 
basket, that 3 arm lengths goes to two, and then to one the closer she gets to 
the basket. It's kind of hard to drive around someone who is that far away 
from you. </p>

<p>If Crash is guarding a forward who is slower than she is, she puts a body on 
the forward and stays within 6 inches of her girl. Crash puts one hand in 
front of the opposing player to block any passes, and the other hand stays 
between the player she is guarding and the basket. Not only is it hard for a 
forward to receive a pass like this, but once they get the ball, what are 
they going to do with it, shoot? Crash blocks a lot of shots every game 
because of this spacing. </p>

<p><b>Weak Side vs Ball Side</b></p>

<p>This is where you might get to stretch for a moment. Do you have one of those 
dry erase boards with a basketball court imprinted on one side? You know, the 
kind you see coaches draw plays on for their players during a game. OK, go 
grab it. If you don't have one, grab a sheet of paper and a pen. </p>

<p>Got everything? Good! Now I'm going to talk to those who are using paper. The 
rest of you with the boards can start at the appropriate time. Now draw a 
halfcourt with free-throw line and all. Now draw a line down the middle of 
your 1/2 court from the middle of the baseline under the basket to the 1/2 
court line. This should give you two equal halves of your half court. If I 
lost you, reread this again and then do it. Now do you've a right side and a 
left side of your half court? Alrighty then! </p>

<p>Now you only need one more item and we can continue on with this very long 
project. Now you need a coin. I would prefer a Susan B. Anthony dollar, but I 
guess any old coin will do. (I just have rich tastes.) So now you have your 
paper or board with your half court divided in half, and you have a coin. </p>

<p>Imagine the coin is the player with the ball. Put the ball on the right side 
of your half court. Now the right side is called ball side, or strong side. 
The left side is called weak side. </p>

<p>Now place the coin, player with ball, on the left side of your court. Now 
your left side is your ball side, and your right side is your weak side. So, 
duh, whatever side the ball is on is your ball side. Whatever side the ball 
taint on is your weak side. </p>

<p>Why did I make this so complicated? I bet my wife I could get a bunch of 
grown adults, (duh, most adults are grown), to draw on dry erase boards and 
paper when it wasn't necessary. OK, I wanted to make sure you wouldn't 
forget, OK? Let's get back to defense. </p>

<p><b>Again, Weak Side vs. Ball Side Defense</b></p> 

<p>It doesn't matter whether your player has the ball for this. If the player 
you are guarding is on the ball side and within 15' of the basket, you play 
more of an IYFD. </p>

<p>If your player is on the weak side, then you play them 2 arm lengths or more 
away from them. You position yourself between the player, the ball, and the 
basket. Here are the benefits of playing the weak side this way. If at all 
possible, weak side players should be standing in the paint or real close to 
it. </p>
<ol>
<li>If someone tries to pass to your player, then you can still intercept the 
pass. </li>

<li>If your teammate on the strong side loses their player, then you can slide 
over and stop their player from driving to the basket. Some people call this 
a sagging defense. </li>

<li>If your player does get the ball, you are still in position to stop them 
from driving to the basket. </li>
</ol>

<p>I don't know about you folks, but I am kinda bored with this. Don't 
misunderstand me, what I just gave you is probably one of the most important 
things to learn. Defense wins games. It's just that I think we both need a 
short break, so let's break out the anti-bored serum. </p>

<p><b>Now You See It - Now You Don't</b></p>

<p>A friend of mine, Dave, runs a summer league for average teams. It's not for 
the super elite club teams, but it's a great parish league for the average 
team. Dave and I are even good enough friends that we co-coached our 
daughters' AAU 11 and under team. </p>

<p>Here's the rest of the background. A guy named Tom is the Lay-Director of 
basketball for this parish. He is also, quite possibly, the worst referee 
that has ever set foot on a hardwood court. </p>

<p>Last spring Tom reffed a game and called 30 fouls in the first half, by 
himself. The other ref called a total of 2 fouls. By the end of the game, Tom 
had called over 50 fouls. A normal game takes at most, an hour to play. This 
game lasted almost two hours. At the end of the game, one team only had four 
players left that had not fouled out. </p>

<p>Here's the last bit of info that you need to know before I can go on. The 
girls who kept track of the scores and fouls at the scorer's table, were all 
6th-8th graders that went to that parish. And, away we go..... </p>

<p>I had a game there and found out that Tom was going to referee the game. I 
knew I was screwed because my girls have always played hard physical 
basketball. I knew that it would be a long game with the other team shooting 
a lot of free throws. So, I called my buddy, Dave, and told him what I had 
planned and told him he had to be there to see this. </p>

<p>Next I went to one of my favorite stores in the world, Spencer Gifts. I truly 
do love that store. I bought my supplies for the game, and I was ready for 
the next step. </p>

<p>I called up the coach we were going to play against, he was another friend of 
mine, and told him my plans. After regaining his composure, he agreed to be a 
party to my plan. Before the game, I met with the opposing coach and gave him 
his supplies. </p>

<p>As you already know, before the game, you have to fill out the scorebook with 
your player's names and numbers. Well, right before the game, and I mean 
right before the tip off, I filled out the book and made sure I handed it to 
Tom, the ref. He's pretty anal retentive, so after CAREFULLY scrutinizing the 
scorebook, he handed it to the scorers. The whole time I was sweating like a 
gutted pig. </p>

<p>The game began and within the first two minutes Tom called a grand total of 6 
fouls. As he looked to the scorer's table to tell them the number of the 
offending player, this is what he saw. Both young girls were rifling through 
all of the papers on the scorer's table. From the looks on their faces, they 
were desperate. </p>

<p>When Tom couldn't get their attention, he called a referee's time-out and 
walked to the table. When these girls saw him coming, they straightened up 
and one of them said, "I'm sorry, who was the foul on?" Tom told them, blew 
his whistle and started the game. </p>

<p>As soon as the game started, these two girls started going through everything 
on their table. They looked under their chair, under the table, and they even 
looked on the stage behind them. I felt sorry for them, because the other 
coach and I had filled out the scorer's book with disappearing ink. </p>

<p>It wasn't another thirty seconds before the next foul was called. Tom looked 
at the scorer's table and the two girls were tearing up the place trying to 
find the pages the other coach and I had filled out. He called another 
referee's time-out and walked over to them. </p>

<p>"What are you doing?" he asked. </p>

<p>"You wouldn't understand," replied one of the girls. "It's a girl thing." </p>

<p>Well, the other coach and I about lost it. These girls didn't want to be 
embarrassed about losing, not one, but both pages of player's names and 
numbers. And how do they cover it up? "It's a girl thing!" If that's not 
priceless, what is? At what age do you girls learn to use this universal 
female way of saying, "Don't ask?" </p>

<p>Tom just shook his head, and started the game again. You could tell who wore 
the pants in his family. Another 30 seconds went by, he called another foul. 
This time the girls 'fessed up and told him they had lost the pages. He 
stopped the game and the three of them looked all over for those pages. </p>

<p>Tom saw Dave and motioned him over into a conference with both coaches. Tom 
explained the situation and asked Dave if he would ref the game for him, and 
Dave agreed. Next Tom said he was going to do the scorer's table and could 
both coaches fill out a new page with the player's names and numbers. </p>

<p>The other coach and I went to the book, took both pens off of the table and 
filled out our pages in real ink. Then we left the two pens with disappearing 
ink on the table for Tom to keep score with and took the real pens with us. </p>

<p>Next the other coach and I asked Dave, our new ref, and my friend who was in 
on it, if we could take a three minute break and quickly go to the restroom. 
He nodded and even joined us. We didn't make it through the restroom door 
before all three of us lost it. We couldn't control the laughter. There was 
more snorting and cackling than you would ever hear at a farm. </p>

<p>On the way back to the gym, Dave told his daughter to go find her two 
girl friends who were doing the scorer's table and explain the practical joke 
and to tell them that no one was mad at them. I handed her two fives to give 
to the girls as a bribe not to tell anyone. </p>

<p>The game began, again. Now we were rid of the ref we didn't want, and we were 
waiting to see how he was going to handle keeping score with the disappearing 
ink. He kept writing down the players points, stare at it for a second, then 
proceed to watch the game. </p>

<p>My players were all in on the prank by now. So, I sent one of my players to 
the table to find out how many points she had, you could see him scratch his 
head and just stare at the page in front of him. Then he took his glasses 
off, as if this were going to help him. Then he told her to sit down and not 
bother the official scorer. I absolutely couldn't control it any longer. I 
laughed until I couldn't breathe. My throat hurt, my stomach hurt, and my 
head hurt. I looked over and the other coach was about in the same shape. </p>

<p>Somehow we made it through that game, and to this day, I don't know how. I 
don't know who won and I really don't care. After the game, I took Dave, his 
daughter, her two friends who started on the scorer's table, and my team for 
a milkshake. The other coach and his team met us at Ted Drew's, a milkshake 
icon in St. Louis, and we laughed for what seemed like hours. </p>

<p><b>Weak Side Zone Defense</b></p>

<p>Alright, I've been off-topic enough. We were talking about defense. Now it 
sure seems like everything I was talking about applied to m-2-m defense and 
not a zone defense, right? The weak side - ball side principles apply as much 
to zone defenses as they do m-2-m. If you are on the weak side, you stay 2 
arm lengths away from the players in your assigned area. Place yourself where 
you can see the ball and the players in your area. Take one hand and point it 
at the ball. Take your other hand and point it at the player in your area. 
Now you are in a perfect defensive position. </p>

<p>Oops, I forgot something, how to position your body. You bend your knees like 
you are squatting and sitting on a wall about three foot high. Now you can 
point at the ball and the player in your area. Now you are in a perfect 
defensive position. </p>

<p><b>Ball Side Zone Defense</b></p>

<p>OK, so you are now playing ball side zone defense. Body Position? Your knees 
are bent, but you aren't going to squat quite as low as you do on the weak 
side. You place one hand in front of the player in your area. This way you 
can deny the pass. Place your other hand between the player and the basket, 
and you are semi-facing your player. You are now within six inches of your 
player. You keep your eyes on the ball, and let your body do the defense. If 
your player starts to move on you, you will feel them move. Now you take your 
eyes off of the ball, and cover your area, not the ball. </p>

<p>I don't care if you play m-2-m defense, or a 2-1-2, or a 2-3, or a 1-3-1, or 
a triangle and 2, or the OLE goobaly gock defense. THESE SPACING PRINCIPLES 
APPLY TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM. If you can teach your team spacing, then 
you will have the absolute best defensive team in your league, bar none. </p>

<p>I am not telling you what specific defense to play, although I will always 
recommend m-2-m defense, I AM teaching you something much more important than 
a specific defense. I am giving you the genetic building block for all 
defenses, SPACING. </p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Chapter 12">Chapter 12</a> The Ultimate Offense</font></h3>

<p>I just gave you a chapter on basketball sense <a href="#Chapter 8"> (Chapter
8)</a>. My point there is to teach 
yourself as a coach, and to teach your players, to understand the game. This 
isn't rocket science. You don't need a doctorate or a high dollar coach to 
point out that you throw a pass in font of a player who is running. In your 
next LS, start looking for the little common sense things that you can 
correct or adjust. You will be amazed at how many little things you will 
find, that can be extremely simple to improve on.</p>

<p>Common sense leads me to this chapter. This is about what I consider to be a common sense 
offense. This chapter's title could have gone either way. It could have read 
The Ultimate Failure. What I'm about ready to go into could go either way. 
This is an offense in theory only. I don't know that it has ever been 
taught, executed, and been successful. It's sort of like the speed of light 
deal. Many scientists have theorized, (how's that for a 50 cent word? OK, 
it's only a 10 cent word), what would happen to a human if they went faster 
than the speed of light.  Just like we can only guess at the results, I can 
only put forward this idea about the ultimate offense without proof that it 
works. Only try this if you and your team meet these 
qualifications:</p>

<ol>
<li>You have to care more about teaching your team, than 
you do about winning today's game.</li>

<li>Your team has to be extremely coachable, able to take constructive criticism.</li>

<li>Both you and your team have to have a lot of patience.</li>

<li>You must have unselfish team players.</li>
</ol>

<p>OK, so you want to know a little bit more about it, huh? I 
call it <b>Read and React Motion Offense</b>. My friends are calling it Riley's 
Waterloo, and time will tell. The basic premise is too simple. No matter 
what defense a team uses, there will always be a second here or there where 
a weakness opens up. If a team, not an individual player but a whole team, 
can play with their heads up and have court vision, they can exploit those 
few seconds when the chink in the other teams armor opens up.</p>

<p>I know, I know! This is the goal of every offense, right? I've probably seen several 
hundred youth teams play, and I've never seen this yet. Most coaches go with 
a set or semi-set offense so it gives the players an idea of where to go and 
what to do. Kids like a routine. Yeah, they may kick and scream about it, 
but in the long run they like it better than chaos. Add this to the fact 
that most youth coaches aren't that knowledgeable, and you get set 
offenses.</p>

<p>Read and react is just the opposite of a set offense, there's 
nothing set about it. Stop, hold the presses. I know I defined court vision 
in my last book, but I can see some of you guys scratching your bald heads. 
I can see some of you women trying to look up it up in the last book. So 
here you go, court vision is keeping your head up and being able to see what 
is happening on the court, the whole court. And being able to do this every 
moment you are on the court. The moment a player dribbles with their head 
down, they lose their court vision. Think about it, when your forwards or 
centers touch the ball, don't you cringe because you know they are going to 
dribble with heads down and lose the ball? The opposite is the other team's 
point guard who can thread a pass to their open player. Now you have court 
vision.</p>

<p>Let me try again now. Read and React is like a chess game. It 
relies on every member of the team being able to have court vision and to 
see the best possible place for them to take advantage of the other team's 
defense. </p>

<p>The thought process works like this. Imagine you are a forward. 
You see a defensive player playing a tight defense on your teammate. You go 
to screen this player even though your teammate you're screening for doesn't 
have the ball. Your teammate sees you coming takes advantage of the screen 
and cuts to the basket. At the same time you make eye contact with your 
guard who does have the ball. They come driving to the basket, and you then 
set a screen for them. The first player you screened for yells for the ball. 
The player guarding you and the screaming player, both move to stop the 
driving guard and the forward yelling for the ball. This leaves you wide 
open. Your guard with the ball has court vision and passes it to you for an 
easy lay-up.</p>

<p>Now I can see some of you thinking that I just lost you. All 
it is, is a scenario where court vision and playing smart can work. I can 
see others of you thinking, "Man, that would make a great play that I could 
teach my team!" It doesn't work like that. If the forward you first screen 
for has a player that is not playing a tight defense, then there is probably 
a better play to make. Read and React is an offense where you continually 
have to ask yourself, "If I do this, what will happen? Is this a better move 
than that?" Again, it's like chess, you always have to think two steps 
ahead.</p>

<p>Read and React can be where you see there are no weaknesses in the 
defense, so you try to figure out what you can do to create a weakness. Your 
players have to be constantly viewing the court and thinking. Read and React 
is a combination of court vision and unselfish, smart basketball. Now if you 
can honestly say you have the right ingredients as a coach and your players 
have the right mind set, then read on McDuff. </p>

<p>Here's how to start 
this program. Your first goal is to get every one your team to be able to 
handle a basketball with their heads up. How? </p>

<p><b>PART ONE Dribbling Exercises</b></p>

<ol>

<li>Play Red Light - Green Light while dribbling one ball the 
length of the court using your hand motions as the stop and go. By using 
your hand signals, they have to keep their heads up to see what to do next. 
You keep watching and correcting when a head goes down. You may need someone 
to help you watch for the heads going down.</li>

<li>Now do Red Light - Green Light while dribbling 2 balls</li>

<li>Once they have Red Light down to 
a science, have them do it again using one tennis ball. When they master 
this, then go with dribbling two tennis balls. If every one of your kids can 
dribble two tennis balls with their heads up, you have the beginnings of 
something very special.</li>

<li>To break up the monotony, throw in some 
suicides using the same basketball, tennis ball progression. To help make 
this fun for the kids, divide them into 2 or 3 teams of 3 or 4 and have them 
compete. The more drills you make competitive, the more fun everyone will 
have.</li>

<li>Go to your high school football stadium and have them do the 
one and 2 ball dribbling up and down the stadium steps. This will provide 
you and them with a lot of laughs and frustration as they chase the balls 
down the steps.</li>

<li>Do drills 1-4 every LS. Future and present 
coaches of the world, in order to get everyone on your team to be able to do 
this, it may take you a year or more. Still have the patience? All I have 
asked you to do is to teach your kids how to handle a basketball with their 
heads up. Every coach needs to teach this and every player needs to know it. 
So...I really haven't asked you to do anything strange or unusual yet. I 
haven't asked you to kiss your brother or sister, so you are still Otay, 
Panky!</li>
</ol>

<p><b>PART 2 PASSING EXERCISES</b></p>

<ol>
<li>In Book 1, I gave you a passing drill called The Ring of Fire.  This drill is great for 
learning how to make a quick pass, using your peripheral vision.</li>

<li>Again, you should know the 3 Man Weave. This teaches you how to make a leading pass to 
a receiver.</li>

<li>Tape a large "X" on a wall about 3.5' off of the floor. 
Have your players dribble by it and try to hit the X  while they are moving. 
Have them do it from different angles, different speeds, and both bounce and 
in the air passes. Over time make your X smaller and smaller.</li>

<li>Now we get original. Your team has school colors. Have 5 of your players 
with school color tops, they are offense. Why in the school colors? It gets 
your team used to recognizing a teammate quickly. Have another 5 players in 
white tops, they are defense. Have one kid with the ball facing away from 
the basket so they can't see behind them. Then arrange your other 9 players 
so that one is slightly open and the rest are totally defended. Once you 
arrange your players, no one moves.  Next, tell the player with the ball to 
turn quickly and pass to the open player. This gets them used to looking for 
the best teammate to pass to. After every pass, explain to everyone why is 
was the right or the wrong pass to make, and why. Rotate ball handlers and 
positions for the other 9 players. Get them use to justifying why they chose 
player they passed to. This is the drill that could take you a solid year 
before anyone masters it, let alone all of them.</li>

<li>Do drills 1-4 every LS.</li>
</ol>

<p>Lets recap for a moment. Have I asked you to work on anything 
but the basics? Nope! The only hard thing about this is that you need to 
keep coming up with new ways to do the same thing to keep it from being 
boring. Use different incentives for the winners of the team competitions, 
and this will help.</p>

<p><b>Part 3 SCREENS AND PICK &amp; ROLL</b></p>

<p>This may be the easiest of the ingredients for Read and React. You have to have every 
player learn how to set a screen that seals. You don't want a screen that is 
easy to get through. You have to teach them to stay motionless once they set 
the screen, or else your player fouled the defense on a "moving screen." The 
only other portion to this, is that once the screen or pick occurs, then you 
teach the screener to roll to the basket looking for a pass or a rebound. 
They roll to the basket EVERY TIME THEY SET A SCREEN, not every time 
but.....they do it EVERY TIME.</p>

<p><b>"TAG - YOU'RE PICKED" DRILL</b></p>

<p>Once you have everyone setting solid picks that seal, it's time to teach you a 
new drill, "Tag-You're Picked." You start off again, by having five 
offensive players in team colored tops and 5 more defensive players in white 
tops. Here's the drill.</p>
<ol>
<li>Arrange your ten players in the 
positions you want them to stand stationary in. No one moves!</li>

<li>Hand the ball to any player. No one moves.</li>

<li>Ask an offensive player, 
without the ball, to tell you where they should set a screen. It can be 
screening the ball handler, or away from the ball. Based on everyone's 
current position, who should they set a pick for?</li>

<li>Then ask them to justify why they chose that person to screen. If they are right, praise 
them. If they are wrong, tell them who they should have chosen, and why. 
Make every player do the same thing based on their positioning.</li>

<li>Now rearrange your players, and tell white they are on offense. Now repeat 
step 4.</li>
</ol>

<p>Are you starting to understand why I said in the beginning, you 
and your players have to have patience and they have to want to learn?  Is 
this for everyone? Hail no! But all you are really doing is making your 
players use their gray matter. You are asking them to think.</p>

<p>You will find a not-so-surprising tidbit when you do the Tag drill. Everyone wants to 
pick for the person with the ball. The reality is, that most of the time the 
best person to set a pick for will be a team mate without the ball.</p>

<p>What's the hardest part about this so far? Keeping your player's 
interest. Remember, they're kids, they came to learn maybe, but still to 
have fun. If you have an hour long LS, then do this drill for about 10 
minutes of every LS. But you do it for ten minutes EVERY LS. Kids learn 
through repetition. After 5-10 LS's, you might start seeing a player make 
the correct choice in  a game. When you see this occur in a game, bow down, 
face Mecca, throw some salt over your left shoulder, buy a Powerball ticket, 
and hit your local watering hole on the way home.  Why?  Because someone on 
your team just  took their game to a new level. Libations will be allowed at 
that appropriate moment. You may even have earned the title of 
coach.</p>

<p><b>STORY TIME</b></p>

<p>For you folks that actually have read enough of 
my ramblings to be able to say that you are getting to know me, then you 
know what's coming next. I HAVE BEEN TOO SERIOUS HERE FOR TOO LONG. I am a 
person who can stay with technical and serious thinks for only so long, 
before I need a break. I'll get back to Read and React in just a moment, but 
first I NEED to break my boredom. It's not that you are boring. I'm boring 
myself with trying to describe Read and React. If I'm bored, I know you have 
to be bored. </p>

<p>Sooooooo ....here's a lil story for you. I'm not a real 
proud individual. I don't have an ego the size of a Clinton, so I hope you 
can have as much fun hearing this story as I do recounting it. If you don't 
like graphic, gross stuff, skip the story and go on to Read and 
React.</p>

<p>In 7th grade I was 6'2," that's big for a beginning 7th grader. I 
can only imagine that my coach was foaming at the mouth when he saw me walk 
into tryouts. He was probably thinking that by 9th grade I would be 6'6" or 
more. I faked him out, I did, I did! I never grew another 
inch.</p>

<p>Anyway, we practiced and practiced until we finally had our first 
game. We were all so excited that we couldn't think of anything except for 
"when do I get to play?" By the luck of the genetic pool, I started. The 
other team had a big ole boy about my height and we kept battling each other 
for rebounds. </p>

<p>At half-time, we went into our locker room and the coach 
started yelling that we screwed up here, and there, and everywhere. We 
didn't care, we were playing our first game and life was good. At the end of 
his tirade, I hit the fountain like there was no tomorrow.</p>

<p>With water 
still dripping off of my chin, we started the second half. Did I tell you 
the other guy was big? OK, but did I tell you he was mean. We battled for 
position, we battled for rebounds, and we were at war. War for a 7th grader 
consists of pushing and shoving, elbowing and stepping on toes. Even as a 
7th grader, he said things that I won't repeat in print. He was big, mean, 
and Mr. Nasty.</p>

<p>About 5 minutes into the game, one of my teammates put up 
a shot and I got the long distance rebound. I put the ball on the floor for 
one dribble, went up into the air for a lay-up, and then it happened. 
</p>

<p>When I said I went up into the air, it wasn't very high up because I 
didn't have much of a vertical. My bladder was about the same height as the 
elbow that Mr. Nasty threw at me. So guess where that fateful elbow fell? 
You got it, right smack dap in the middle of my Lake Erie. </p>

<p>I fell to 
the floor in pain. I had consumed so much water at the half, that I could 
have floated The Titanic. I was in such pain I couldn't hold it any longer, 
and Lake Erie gushed out, and I mean everywhere.</p>

<p>The ref never called a 
foul so the game was continuing. Both teams were fighting for my rebound. 
With the floor becoming a river of pee, everyone started slipping and 
sliding, and before you could say " Peter Piper Pee'd a Peck," (Pee'd a 
peck?), anyway, half of both teams slipped and fell. Where did they fall? 
Right into Lake Erie. Everyone on the floor got soaked someplace. Beside me 
lay Mr. Nasty, face down on the floor with one of his teammates laying 
across him, face down.</p>

<p>I told you before, there's a time to act, and a 
time to react. But every once in a lifetime, there's a time to do both. 
There was no more a perfect time to do both, than right then.</p>


<p>I jumped up and acted like I was smelling one of the real wet spots on my 
uniform. "God, this smells like pee! Did you pee in your pants?" I yelled as 
I pointed at Mr. Nasty. </p>

<p>That was all it took. Everyone was 
scrambling to get out of Lake Erie and that made it even worse. Even more 
players ended up in the Lake. By the time the smoke cleared, at least 8 
players had fallen and all of them ready to choke Mr. Nasty. </p>

<p>I never knew Mr. Nasty, or even saw him again. I only know that I sequestered him 
away, and he became the original member of the Wetness Protection Program. 
One thing's for sure, I just proved I am not an overly proud or egotistical 
individual, because I just ratted on myself.</p>

<p>Let's get back to Read and 
React. You know how to teach them to look for the open player to pass to. 
You know how to teach them to look for the best mate to set a pick for. Do 
not implement the next part, until your team has drill #4 and Tag-You're 
Picked almost down to a science. If you try to go too fast, you'll be on 
step 8 when the rest of your team is only on step 3. That's not a Good 
thing!</p>

<p>Once your team is ready, then it's sort of like a cake, you have 
some ingredients, but now what do you do? NOW HERE'S THE REST OF THE STORY, 
OR HOW TO BAKE YOUR PIE!</p>

<p><b>WJE Passing Drill</b></p>

<p>Let's go back to red light-green light, only this time your whistle begins and ends all 
movement. Begin your baking process by explaining to your players that you 
know that they are going to make a lot of mistakes in the beginning. You 
also know that the longer they do this exercise, they fewer mistakes they 
are going to make.</p>

<p>Next, tell them they are going to play half court 
5-on-5. Every time you blow the whistle they are to stop immediately and not 
move from that spot. Also, they are not allowed to screen for each other. 
You are simply looking for them to pass to the appropriate 
teammate.</p>

<p>The game starts and the first time someone makes a pass to the 
wrong player, blow the whistle. Of course they won't stop on a dime, so you 
may have to rearrange them back into the whistle-blowing position. Then ask 
the passer to justify why they picked that person to pass to. Afterwards, 
tell them who they should have passed to and why.</p>

<p>Coaches of the world, if you use a sour tone in your voice, this won't work. What you will 
have are a bunch of doe eyes, staring into the car headlights. They cannot 
think you are attacking them or making fun of them. They have to believe you 
are teaching them positively to become a better player and a better team.</p>

<p>Every time someone makes a bad pass, whistle, justify, and explain. 
WJE, pronounced woogee = whistle, justify, explain. By Jove, I do believe I 
just came up with a new saying, WJE! Gosh, I'm so dumb. I just realized how 
new sayings occur.    When you get tired of writing something, you come up 
with a new, shorter way to say it. DUUHHHHH!!!</p>

<p>To get back on topic, 
make sure everyone gets a chance to pass the ball and then WJE them. I would 
do this for about 10 minutes and then reward them with a competitive drill 
with spoils for the victors. They need to have some fun, doing something fun 
for a while. Don't ever lose your team to total boredom. After they have 
gotten some of the boredom out of their system, you are ready for the next 
step. </p>

<p><b>WJE Picking Drill</b></p>

<p>Same red light-green light premise, only 
this time tell them you are looking for them to set the best picks possible. 
When they hear the whistle they stop dead in their tracks. Every time 
someone picks the wrong person to pick for, WJE. Again, I'd spend about 10 
minutes per LS on this.</p>

<p>Want the end results on the WJE Drills? No 
results in the beginning, Rome was not built in a day. It may take you 
months and months before you see something. But....what is it you hope to 
see? Michael Jordan flying through the air? A flurry of 3 pointers made in a 
row? Don't think so, this isn't ESPN Sportscenter. What you will see is 
basketball in it's purest form. You will see passes to open players. You 
will see your team create holes in the other team's defense that were never 
there before. You will see unselfish TEAM BASKETBALL at it's best.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the beauty of Read and React, how do you defend 
an offense that is not defined? It never is played the same way twice, 
unless the opposing team keeps making the mistake over and over again. It's 
like the ole saying, "How do you catch the wind?"</p>

<p>So let me give you one more ingredient here, you have to teach your team how to shoot. All an 
offense is designed to do is provide an opportunity for an open shot. To win 
a game, you have to make a lot of your shots, more than the other team 
makes. If Read and React gives you a lot of open looks at the basket, then 
you have to be able to make some of them. If not, you have done all of this 
for nothing. How to improve your shooting will be a different chapter in 
this book.</p>

<p><b>RECAP</b></p>

<p>I have tried to make this easy to understand, I 
hope I have succeeded. I am trying to let you integrate this into your LS's 
without taking up your whole LS. If you try this, you will need to devote 
about 20 minutes plus per LS. Have I gone into the everything concerning the 
Read and React? Nope! But anything more would make this more than just an 
excerpt. Just stay tuned and we will start posting the book here, and soon I 
hope. If you have any questions, e-mail me at <A href="mailto:firepow55@aol.com">firepow55@aol.com</A>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Chapter 13">Chapter 13</a> - The Wheels On The Bus Go Round & Round</font></h3>

<p><i>by Ed Riley, copyright 2001</i></p>

<p>I've had so many e-mails from you readers asking me for a simple offense 
against a m-2-m defense that I guess it's time to give you a simplified version of The Wheel. 
Remember, it is to be used against m-2-m defenses only, not against a zone. The purpose of 
this offense, and most offenses, is to spread out the defense.</p>

<p>Space all 5 of your players outside the 3 point line, and space them equally 
apart. This should end up looking like a half circle surrounding the basket. Here are the 
rules:
<ol>

<li>Every time you pass the ball,  you cut to the basket looking for a pass.</li>

<li>Every time you get passed the ball, look to see if you can drive to the 
basket, or if the cutter is open to pass to. </li>

<li>If you or the cutter are not open, then pass to the person on either side 
of you, and now you cut to the basket looking for a pass. The process begins all over again.</li>

<li>If you the cutter does not get passed to, then when they finished with 
their cut, have them go to the baseline positions outside the 3 point range. </li>
</ol>

<p>Timeout, I just lost you, right? OK, draw a 1/2 court and include the 3 point 
arc. Now draw circles for your players. 
<ol>
<li>Draw a small circle to the right and left of the basket outside the 3 
point arc. If you connected these 2 circles, it would form a line parellel to the baseline. 
Make the circles about 5 feet away from the baseline. Number this position on the left 1, and 
the one on the right 5.</li>

<li>Now draw a circle at the top of the key, outside the 3 point arc. It 
should be in the middle of the court so the player is staring straight at the basket. Now # 
this position 3.</li>

<li>Draw a small circle 1/2 way between players 1 and 3, this is position 
number 2.</li>

<li>Draw another small circle between players 3 and 5, and this is position 
number 4.</li>
</ol>
<p>So now you have a semi-circle of players in positions 1-5, all outside of the 
3 point line.</p>

<p><b>So here's how it works.</b></p>

<p>If 3 has the ball and passes to 2, then 3 runs to the basket looking for a 
pass. In the meantime, number 4 runs over and takes 3's original position. Then 5 moves up 
and takes 4's position. If the original 3 doesn't get passed to, then they move over to 
5's original position. This gives you a new 1-5 set up. Now you can go back up to the 
original rules, re-read them and they should make sense.</p>

<p>How do you teach this offense? First they learn their position, so never have 
the player with the ball pass to the cutter. Just have them pass and cut, and learn how 
to rotate to the empty spot. Once they learn this, then start having them pass to the cutter 
whenever you blow your whistle. If you don't blow the whistle, they don't pass.</p>

<p>A  simple rule? The person cutting to the basket should look to the passer 
for the pass. I have actually seen an open cutter, but not looking for the pass. The passer 
is trained to look for the open cutter, so if the cutter is open, they pass the ball. I've 
seen passes bounce off of the back of cutter's heads before, because they weren't looking for 
the pass. And, THAT HURTS!</p>

<p>Another simple rule? If you are a cutter, don't yell for the ball unless you 
are really open.</p>

<p>Want another one? Don't pass to the cutter unless they are open.</p>

<p>The major disadvantage to this offense is rebounding. You have absolutely no 
one in position to get a rebound when a player does shoot. You have to teach your 
players that every time a teammate shoots, they need to crash the boards quickly to get 
the rebound. A word of caution, always have a player in position 2,3, or 4 stay back around 
the top of the key on a rebound. This way you have a person back to help stop the other 
team's fast break, should the other team get the rebound.</p>

<p>Sounds complicated? It's not. If it was too complicated I wouldn't be able to 
do it, because I am no rocket scientist. Play with your diagrams and use coins as your 
players . Move the coins as a player would move. All of a sudden, the light bulb will come on 
and you'll understand it.</p>

    <h2><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Chapter 14">Chapter 14</a> My Best Kept
    Secret Drill</font></h2>

<p><i>by Ed Riley copyright 2002</i></p>

<p>I know, I know, best drills are a matter of opinion. Beauty is in the eye of
the beholder, right? So that's why this is my best drill, not everyone's.
Here's the but, but what if I could convince you that it is the best drill?
That would be quite a challenge, wouldn't it? So here's my best shot at
having fun convincing you.

<p>We do drills to teach players how to do something. We do the same drill every
LS because we coaches are a smart breed. We took our inhumane psych 101, and
we know that kids learn things by repetition. The more they do it, they
better they become at doing it. So we do the same drills every LS.

<p>We, the intelligent adults that we are, and I use that term loosely, also
know that if a drill can teach a player more than one thing, it's a great
drill. So if a drill can teach your players more than any other drill, that
would qualify it for &quot;The Best Drill,&quot; right? So let's see what my
best drill might accomplish.</p>

<ol>
<li>What if it teaches your players to move without the ball?</li>
<li>What if it forces your forwards and centers to learn how to dribble?</li>
<li>What if it gets even your guards to learn to block out?</li>
<li>What if it helps teach your players the effectiveness of a screen?</li>
<li>What if it teaches your players competitiveness and how to be more
aggressive?</li>
</ol>

<p>I can hear you all now, &quot;Yeah right, and rats have wings!&quot; I hear you
Doubting Thomas's out there, and I would feel the same way if I were you. But
what if I'm right? It would one heck of a drill and it would qualify for the
Best Drill Hall of Fame. Here are the rules of the &quot;Drill.&quot;</p>

<ol>
<li>Divide your team into 2 relatively equal teams, quality-wise and by equal
number of players on each team.</li>
<li>Hopefully you are practicing on a full-sized court with six baskets. If
you go sideways and divide the court in 1/2, you have 2 smaller basketball
courts.</li>
<li>You now have your 2 teams play each other in a full court 3-on-3 game on
one of these shorter courts.</li>
<li>No one is allowed more than 3 dribbles.</li>
</ol>

<p>After several times of doing this, you will be astounded by the results.
First let's talk about conditioning. No one likes to do laps that I know of.
3-on-3 is about 2 to 3 times faster than regular basketball. It's hard to
stay in for over 3-4 minutes without signaling to come out for a breather.
Your players will get into shape and have fun.

<p>Next, let's talk about moving without the ball. I have yet to meet a coach
who hasn't complained about how they wish their players would move to get
open. When there are only 3 on a team, and when no player is allowed more
than 3 dribbles and then they must pass, everyone learns real quickly to move
to get open. Trust me, it just happens!

<p>How about teaching your forwards and centers to handle a ball? In 3-on-3
there are no forwards or centers. There are 3 players on the court who have
to play every position. With the 3 dribble rule, forwards and centers must
dribble the ball. Guards have to learn to block out. Everyone learns to
screen. Everyone has to learn everyone else's position.

<p>Competitiveness? Losers run a suicide, that gets their juices flowing.

<p>If you let them do this the last 15 minutes of every LS, your LS's end on a
fun note, and you will see them start to learn right before your very eyes.

<p>Now it's time for me to fess up, and state the obvious = this wasn't a drill
I went into, now was it? OK, I cheated just a little. But it is part of our
practice routine and over the years, my teams have learned more from this
than any drill I have ever shown them.

<p>Sorry this chapter was so short. What's that? You like shorter chapters
because they're easier to read? All right, I got the message, or did I?

<h2><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Chapter 15">Chapter 15</a> A Few Ball Handling Drills</font></h2>
<p><i>by Ed Riley</i></p>

<p><b>The Slide (or the Ladder)</b> - a passing, catching and footwork drill</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Line up all but 1 of your players on the baseline, facing the opposite basket, about 4' or 
so apart. For the sake of simplicity, let's number them 2 through 10. </li>
<li>You need 2 balls.</li>
<li>The 1 player has a ball and stands about 8' away, facing # 2 who is at one of the ends of 
the player's line. </li>
<li>#2 now has a ball and the 1 player facing them has a ball.</li>
<li>The 1 player passes to #3, the #2 passes to #1, who passes to #4, while catching the pass from #3. #1 
passes to the next person in line, while catching a pass from the last 
person they threw the ball to.</li>
<li>Players 2-10 never move, except to step into the pass they are receiving from #1.</li>
<li>#1 slides their feet as they move down the line catching and passing. They never cross 1 foot in 
front of the other as they move, THEY SLIDE FROM SIDE TO SIDE.</li>
<li>Once #1 has made it to the end, they go the other way and pass to 9, while 
receiving a pass from 10. When they make it back down to #2, then it's #2's 
turn to do the drill. #1 now takes a place in line.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's my attempt at a diagram. Quit laughing, at least I'm trying.<BR>
2  3  4  5  5  6  7  8  9  10<BR>
1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1 
<p>After 1 passes to #3, 1 slides right while receiving the pass from 2, They constantly are sliding 
right as they pass. Once they get to 10, they go back the other way. Do this until everyone has 
been back and forth once.</p>

<p><b>The Reverse Direction Drill</b></p>
<p>This is a SET of ball handling drills using the following pattern. 
Draw a basketball court with halfcourt line and both free-throw lines. 
Number the following positions on your drawing.
<p>#1 = Bottom right hand corner of court, where baseline meets the out of bounds line.</p>
<p>#2 = Middle of closest free-throw line.</p>
<p>#3 = Where half court meets the out of bounds line on the right side of the court.</p>
<p>#4 = Middle of farthest free-throw line.</p>
<p>#5 = Farthest corner of court where baseline meets the out of bounds on right side of court.</p>
<p>Folks, if you draw a line from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, and 4 to 5, this should look like a 
zigzag on the right side of the court.</p>

<p>CROSSOVER</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>Player starts on 1 and dribbles to position 2 left-handed.</li>
<li>At 2 they do a crossover, and dribble right handed to position 3.</li>
<li>C. At position 3, they do another crossover and dribble left handed to position 4.</li>
<li>At position 4, they do another crossover and dribble right handed to position 5.</li>
<li>When they do their crossover, they dribble lower to the ground while switching their dribbling hands.</li>
<li>SPIN MOVES using the same positions 1 - 5 as in the Crossover Drill</li>
<li>The player runs the same route, 1-5. Every time they reach a numbered position, they use a spin move to change their direction and dribbling hands.</li>
</ol>
<p>BEHIND THE BACK using the same positions 1-5</p>
<p>The player uses the same route, 1 - 5. Every time they reach a 
numbered position, they do a behind the back pass to themselves to change 
direction and dribbling hands.
<p><b>Duck Walk or Figure 8's</b> - a ball handling drill
<p>Have the player do a figure 8 between their legs with 
the ball. You can learn this movement while you sit in your chair 
reading this. Go grab a ball, a book, even a pen. Let's say you have a book. 
Now hold the book in your right hand in between your knees. Take the book 
under your left knee, and reach down and grab it with your left hand. Take 
the book in your left hand and take it on the outside of your left knee, 
then take it under your right knee and hand it to your right hand. Voila, 
you now have a figure 8. This is how your players must do it with a 
basketball, just not sitting down.</p>
<p>Duck Walk = Have your players on the baseline with a ball. They do a figure 8 between their 
legs while they walk the length of the court. When they get good at this, have them walk 
backwards and do it.
<p>Once the players get accustomed to these drills, you can do all of them in 15 minutes. 
For the younger players, this may be all the ball handling drills you need to teach them for a 
while. If your 3rd grade through 7th grade team can all do crossovers, behind the back,
spin moves, and the rest of these moves, then they will be one of the best 
ball handling teams in your league.
<p>One thing to remember, these drills are for your forwards and centers as well. The kid who 
is your center today, may not grow anymore, and may be your guard 2 years from now. Everyone 
should become a ball handler.</p>

<h2><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Chapter 16">Chapter 16</a> <a name="Perception">Perception</a> - Reality, Not Necessarily Truth</font></h2>

<p><i>by ed riley copyright 2002</i></p>

<p>As some of you know, I run a car dealership. I can hear you folks doing the 
car salespeople jokes now. "What do you do when you see a car salesman 
bleeding on the side of a road? Drive on by!" OK, I just said one for you.

<p>Anyway, I was just sent to a 2 day class that cost my dealership $2,500. I 
don't know about you folks, but that's pretty expensive in my book. So what 
was I doing there when I wasn't trying to fall asleep, thinking basketball. 
What did I learn? Something to help me work on one of my team's major 
weaknesses. So it was a really good training session and learning session for 
me. (Yes, I'm a basketball rabid, sick puppy.)

<p>My team has always been a what you see, is what you get. We play full court 
in-your-face defense every second of every game. We contest every inbounds 
pass. We depend on speed. Last, we will outrun you. We may be down by 12 at 
the half, and win by 12. Why? If you can't run full speed the whole game, you 
lose. A side note here, because of all of this, we are a fun team to watch.

<p>If the coach of a team knows anything about us, then they try to play a 
slowdown game and this is where we lose a lot of games. We are a very 
straightforward one dimensional team. What you think it's going to be like, 
is what it will be, speed and m-2-m.

<p>So I'm sitting in this training session learning all about customer 
satisfaction and trying to exceed a customer's expectations. All necessary in 
my line of work, but a widdle bit on da boring side. 

<p>The speakers flips the page on his flip chart and writes P = R, Not The 
Truth! Great, now we are learning algebra. Let's just design the trajectory 
of the next Mars probe while we're at it. The next thing he says catches my 
attention.

<p>"P = perception. R = reality. So to our customers, Perception = Reality, but 
not necessarily the Truth. You dealers can bend over backwards to solve a 
customer's problem, but the customer may not think so. Their perception is 
reality to them. 

<p>At this point in time, my ears perk up and the sleep buggers in my eyes 
magically disappear. What's real doesn't matter to a customer. What matters 
is what they think is real. Sometimes their reality is what they think it 
should be.

<p>Ummmm!!!! My basketball mind is a flutter with new/old horizons. This has got 
to apply to basketball is what my pea sized brain tells my elephant sized 
head. So what a team or a player thinks, is what they believe. Perception = 
Reality to them. 

<p>I remembered a game we played several years ago. We were playing against a 
highly touted team we had never played before. They were supposed to have 
great guards, and our rep was our speed. So I decided to confuse their 
guards. 

<p>Every time my guards brought the ball up the court, I had them dribble left 
handed and go slightly to the left side. I wanted their guards to think we 
were left handed. Once my guard would hit the top of the key they would do a 
crossover and drive to the right for a relatively easy basket. We must have 
scored 20 points this way.

<p>Why did this work? Because their guards expected us to drive to the left side 
of the court because they thought we were left handed. Perception = 
Reality!!!! I'm not saying this to brag, even a blind squirrel will find an 
acorn once in a while. I'm using this to make my point.

<p>Perception = right handed guards go to the right - left handed guards drive 
left. This is a relatively true perception. So I used this belief and we won 
by 10 or more, who cares? The point is that a player's perception is their 
reality. 

<p>My team had always been a damn the torpedoes and straight ahead kind of team. 
My job from here on out is to play upon the other team's perceptions and 
exploit them. So how can this help you?

<p>I have never gone into faking a lot because of bullet passes and our speed. 
Now I have been converted, I see the light. Fake one way, go another. Fake a 
pass to the right, go left. Exploit a player's perceptions.

<p>A player is guarding you close, head fake them Jerk your head up quickly 
toward the basket like you are going to shoot, then drive right or left.

<p>A simple spin move = spin to the left, get 1/2 way through and spin the other 
way. The defensive player will almost break their ankles trying to switch 
directions as you fly by them.

<p>You are going up for a lay-up, as your feet leave the ground, look to your 
left for a millisecond like a teammate is there and you are going to pass to 
them. Your defender will back off of you as you are now totally free to 
execute your lay-up.

<p>Head fakes, shoulder fakes, ball fakes, which hand do you dribble with fake, 
there are a million of them. I have seen other teams perform them all and 
always thought that this was wasted motion. Well, folks, I was wrong! I was 
too stupid to use them. I was like the coaches who preach never to make a one 
handed pass. There is a time and a place for every basketball weapon, we just 
need to use them at the appropriate time. 

<p>So folks, now you have today's Algebra Lesson. 

<p>Perception = Reality, But Not Necessarily The Truth!

<p>The older I get the more I am constantly amazed by how smart my parents were. 
I'm sure we have all experienced our parents telling us, "Well, in my day we

stuff that parents tell their kids. As a kid my response was always, "Yeah,

appropriate time but tune them out when they talked like this. I'm sure you 
coaches and players alike know exactly what I'm talking about.

<p>Sheesh, I just remembered a perfect example of this. I heard about a coach 
who coached at a school for the deaf. Most of the players couldn't hear at 
all, but some could hear with the help of some major hearing aids. When these 
hearing aid players got bored with their coach's speech, they would turn down 
the volume on their hearing aids and pretend they were broken.

<p>Anyway, my parents used to give me these speeches about working hard if you 
want to get any where in life. I always tuned them out for the most part. 
This same analogy applies to players and coaches. 

<p>You coaches may relate to this. You are giving your "You have to work harder 
if you want to get better" speech. As you are talking you can see the players 
eyeballs roll back up into the back of their head. When you see this, YOU 
HAVE JUST ENCOUNTERED THE ZONE!  I'm sure you players know what I am talking 
about as well. I am sure that you encounter this zone every time you talk 
about work ethics. 

<p>Work ethics? Yes, basketball work ethics. Players learn moves, how to shoot, 
proper skills, and everything else by repetition, by doing it over and over 
again. We coaches talk a lot about it and then expect our players to listen 
and do it at home on their own. I guess that we adults have forgotten about 
the ZONE. I guess we have forgotten that calling our friends after school is 
a major part of our life. Now we have the Internet to make after school hours 
even busier. 

<p>Here's a S.W.A.G. for you. Have a talk with your players and ask them to 
practice some of these moves you have been teaching them. Watch their faces 
and body language, and you will be able to tell right then who is going to do 
it, and who won't. My SWAG is that you will find your better players are 
listening to you and the rest entered the Zone. The players that need help 
the most, will ZONE you in a heartbeat. There's just no justice, is there?

<p>So how do you get around this? How do you make your point and get results? 
Hummm, bribery? No! Yelling? Don't think so. How about homework???? OK, after 
all, that is the title of this chapter.

<p>Teachers get your kids to do things you never dreamed of, right? You ask them 
to empty the dish washer and 2 days later, it's still full, as well as the 
sink. Their teacher gives them homework and what happens? Yes, they wait till 
the last second, but they get it done. It's a bloomin miracle, it is!

<p>Words change the way people look at things. I use the term Learning Session 
rather than practice. It let's people know what they are there for. I use the 
term "Homework." This announces to my players that it is required and they 
might be graded on it. How do you grade basketball homework? With more or 
less playing time. Playing time is a player's report card.

<p>So the next time you want to preach about what they need to do outside of 
your Learning Sessions, don't! Just verbally hand out their homework. Keep it 
short and to the point. Here's an example:

<p>"OK, gang, tonight's homework assignment to shoot 300 freethrows before our 
next L.S. That's your homework. I will be able to tell if you did it, and I 
will grade your results."

<p>Did I yell, pull out my remaining 8 hairs, or spend a lot of time on it? No, 
no, and no! I didn't ask them to do something, I very nicely told them what I 
needed done and that they would be graded on it. The only other thing you 
need to do is to follow up with the grading in your next LS. 

<p>Wanna know what the results will be? Most of them will do it. You did not 
take too long talking and send them into the zone. You told them what their 
homework was and let them know they will be tested on it. You grade them on 
it next week, and life is good! 

<p>So the real point is, quit giving long sermons. That means DO NOT BE LIKE ME! 
Your players have a short attention so recognize this fact and then use it to 
your advantage. I would have homework to hand out after every LS. You only 
have an hour or so of gym time per week, so don't use it preaching, use it 
teaching.

<p>Two things I want to add here. A sub-theme of Book 1 was SIMPLE IS GOOD! 
Sometimes in the hustle and bustle of coaching, and work, and teaching, and 
trying to have a real life outside of work and basketball, we adults see life 
in a much more complicated manner. We are dealing with younger and less 
worldly youths, and life sure is simple to them. Life isn't black, white, or 
even grey, it's just life. So the simpler we make things, the better the 
results will be when dealing with our players. But isn't that true about 
everything in life as well? SIMPLE IS GOOD!!!!

<p>The other thing is that I am trying to take the advice of a lot of you 
readers, keep it short. Many of you can only spend 15 minutes at a time on 
the net, so shorter is better for a lot of you. So see, I am trying to be 
customer friendly. I hope this works for you.

<p>If you have any questions feel free to post them on the discussion board on 
my website. Not only will you get my sick answers, but you will have several 
quality coaches who can lend you their expertise. My web address is

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Chapter 18">When The Inmates Run The Asylum</a></font> </h3>
<P><i>by Ed Riley copyright 2002 </i></p>
<P>I just knew this was going to be a special week, I could just feel it in 
these ole bones, special, special, special. This was going to be a week that 
would go down in the history books as "That Week." A little background? OK! 
<P>An acquaintance of mine, Gary Pinkerton, now a friend, and I started a 
basketball academy in Sept. of 2001. Our goal was to teach basketball to girls. 
Gary had been doing this for 2 years by himself with maybe sixteen 9-11 year old 
girls. I had spent several years coaching between 1-3 teams of slightly older 
girls. 
<P>I had an idea and Gary and I met one night. After his 1 Bud Lite and my 4 
vodka and tonic tall, we agreed to start this academic experience. By God, we 
were going to hook up and open South County Basketball Academy. 
<P>Gary is excellent at teaching the basic skills. He would be the primary 
teacher and I would be the administrator, the paperwork shuffler. I promised my 
wife 1 night a week was all I was going to put into this, except when we played 
our 70 games in the spring/summer. Yes, 70 games! 
<P>We decided that our 1st real games would be with AAU. AAU stands for Amateur 
Athletic Union. You pay $12 to join and this gives your players a $200 
deductible insurance policy. Here in St. Louis, you get to play 2 games and if 
you don't qualify, AAU is over until next year. If you do qualify, you get to 
play 1 more qualifying tourney, if you don't qualify, it's over. If you do 
qualify in that round, you go to a national championship tourney somewhere. 
<P>We thought we might have as many as 40 girls join us and we would enter 4 
teams of ten players per team. A nice manageable number, 40. Movies = 40 Days, 
40 Nights. The Bible says it rained 40 days and 40 nights. On your 40th 
birthday, some wise-ass buys you a black cake, signifying you are over-the-hill 
and close to death. So all things considered, 40 seemed like a perfect number to 
shoot for. Organizing for 40 would be a piece of cake. 
<P>Ole man Murphy, who came up with Murphy's Law, was a pretty wise ole boy. Our 
40 turned into 120 plus. 
<P>So now you have the background. And now we come to ..... 
<P>"That Week" 
<P>Prologue - This was our week to play in the AAU tourney. I had ordered the 
uniforms well in advance and they were to be here Monday. The tourney started on 
Friday so there was my breathing space. Monday the store called and said to come 
pick up the uniforms. Everything was progressing nicely. 
<P>I go to pick the uniforms up, and they have no record of anyone calling me 
saying "Merry X-mas, their ready." My uniforms were at the printers and would be 
done in a week and 1/2. After explaining there must be some mistake, we were 
playing Friday and I had to have them, I had to listen to everyone in the store 
blame everyone else, but there would be no uniforms. I walked out of the store 
wondering how could a small mom-and-pop shop allow a $5,000 order walk out the 
door. 
<P>The next day my uniform salesperson, who is also a friend of mine, calls and 
says the uniforms will be delivered to me on Weds. And apologizes for his 
store's employee's ignorance. So all is right with the world again. 
<P>I get the uniforms, inventory them by number and size, and mentally match 
them up with the sizes I was given by the PLAYERS THEMSELVES. Oila! I have just 
enough of everything, even though our number of players have grown like rabbits. 
Life is good. 
<P>I couldn't go to our Weds. Learning Session because of my daughter's high 
school basketball awards banquet, so I give the uniforms to Gary to pass out and 
log. He does an excellent job, everything gets logged. Life is good!!! 
<P>Until the Inmates Run The Asylum! 
<P>"That Week" 
<P>One player who is totally a medium size, wants to be cool and takes a large 
top and an extra-large bottom. See, it's cool to have your basketball bottoms be 
too long. It's not like you see these players continually hiking them up because 
they are falling down or in the way, or anything. Or maybe that's what those 
players are doing on ESPN, hummm! 
<P>Well, this starts a run on x-tra larges. So now I have 4 players, who really 
do wear x-tra large, trying to fit into mediums. Every see the movie Big with 
Tom Hanks? There's a scene where he is hopping around trying to fit into a 
little kid's pants. Problem is, this isn't a movie. 
<P>Next problem, the smaller girls don't want to give up the x-tra larges 
because now they won't be cool. So when we force the issue, we have players with 
attitudes and we are the bad guys. Life is good???? 
<P>"That Week" 
<P>1. We play on Friday and get our game schedules on Wednesday. AAU goes by 
what year a girl was born in. We have a 1985 team. Only 2 girls were born in 85 
so I have the rest of the team made up of 1986 players, so most of our team is 
playing up a year. Then we have 2 more teams of 1985 players. 
<P>2. I get our schedule and see that they have us for 2 teams of 1984 players, 
and we don't have any 84 teams. I call up and leave a message that there is a 
mistake. 
<P>3. They e-mail they're sorry and give me a new schedule for only one 84 team 
and two 85 teams. I have no 84's and only one 85 team. In the meantime, my two 
85 players drop out, so my 85 team is really an 86 team, playing up. 
<P>4. I get my final corrected schedule 1 day before the tourney. I coach 2 
teams, 87 and 86. Now my teams are playing at the same time, 20 minutes away 
from each other. Why ask for another change? I would probably get a corrected 
schedule 20 minutes after my first game was to start, sheesh! 
<P>"That Week" 
<P>I get informed the day before our first game that 8 of our players are going 
on vacation, it's spring break week. Like they didn't know this earlier?? 
<P>"That Week" 
<P>2 of my parents tell me the night before the game, that they won't let their 
daughters play in, nor take their family to, "That Part Of Town" to play. 
<P>"That Week" 
<P>I get 12 phone calls saying their daughters really hate their uniform number 
and I "NEED" to change them. 
<P>"That Week" 
<P>The AAU tourney director calls the night before the games and assigns us 2 
more games because he has only one 1984 team and has to give them 2 games. My 
players are dropping like flies, and he gives us 2 more games. 
<P>"That Week" 
<P>Our last real "Practice," on Thursday before our games the next day, sees 1/3 
of our girls absent because of their high school track meet. 
<P>"That Week" 
<P>One of my coaches complains about playing his 15 year olds playing against 17 
yr. olds in a fun, but meaningless game and doesn't want the extra game. And, 
tells me that if it weren't so late in the deal, his team wouldn't play any of 
the games because they have to travel 45 minutes to the games!!!! 
<P>"That Week" 
<P>And this was the straw that broke the camels back, my wife didn't want to go 
to the local watering hole after all of this! 
<P>What's the point, other than me venting? Steinbeck said it best, "The best 
laid plans of mice and men, oft go astray!" No matter how well you have 
something planned, take 2 aspirin every morning the week before a big event, 
something is going to go wrong. 
<P>No, the real point is this, as a coach you want to be the nice guy. You took 
on this responsibility because of your love of the game and your love of kids. 
You want to be, at the least, liked by your kids and their parents. You are a 
nice person, right? 
<P>There are going to be times when things happen that are totally out of your 
control: uniforms on time, your game schedule, it snows so when there is no 
school you lose your gymtime, and the list goes on. You cannot control these 
events. 
<P>But never let the patients run the asylum. Your world is crazy enough without 
letting the players and their parent's perception of you, run your world. 
<ol>
<li>A kid who is a medium gets a medium uniform that you specifically ordered 
for them! </li>
<li>A player gets the number you assign them! </li>
<li>Don't apologize for telling a player to shut their yap when they talk at 
the wrong time! </li>
<li>When a player doesn't inform you they can't make it, on a timely basis, 
discipline them. Sometimes it seems like common courtesy is a lot art, doesn't 
it? </li>
<li>When a player fails to tell you they can't come to a game or a Learning 
Session, discipline them = loss of playing time. </li>
<li>Adhere to the "1 Minute Manager," never hold a lengthy conversation about 
a problem. Explain the problem to the player/parent, explain how best to correct 
this problem, explain the repercussions, and walk away. Do not get into a 
Presidential Debate with the other party. </li>
<li>Drumroll please ........... Never lose control of the things that you can 
control. You don't have to be mean and nasty about anything, ever! Just be 
direct, to the point. Explain the problem - Explain how to CORRECT the problem - 
Explain the repercussions - AND WALK AWAY! </li>
<li>This is the last and hardest thing to do, if you are right, then don't 
relent. If you dole out a punishment, stick to your guns. Do not let them off 
the hook! Bench them, run them, whatever you decide to do, but make them follow 
through with it. </li>
</ol>
<P>As a coach and an inhuman being, (like that didja)? I want my players to 
learn that they must be responsible for their own actions. I don't care if it's 
a 9 year old, or a 17 year old, a person should be responsible for their own 
actions. I not only want it, I demand it of my players. Always maintain control. 
DON'T LET THE INMATES RUN THE ASYLUM!!!!!! 
<P>And how did my AAU turn out? We play tonight and I am going to have fun, win 
or lose! If I get beat by 60 points, I am still going to try to make sure my 
players have fun. 
<P>And what about "That Week"? One of my 120 players, one that I barely know, 
E-mailed me a note last night. She thanked me for letting her join and said that 
she is having more fun and learning more than ever before. This one young lady 
made my week worthwhile. So "That Week" was a great week!! (Of course the 
lobotomy helped)!!!! </P>

<h3><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Chapter 19">Chapter 19</a> Sheesh, They're Lost or The Missing Link</font></h3>

<P><i>by Ed Riley copyright 2002 </i>

<P>So I get this idea in my head, based on a recent experience or emotion, and I 
think, "That would make a great chapter!" Now I have found that if I don't write 
it soon, I lose my train of thought and the emotions behind them. Must be ole 
fart's disease! So I am ignoring some pressing matters with my local shrink to 
bring this to you before I lose my train of thought. 
<P>Why did I just write the 1st paragraph? Because this will be a short chapter 
and the 1st chapter makes it a little bit longer? Dah! 
<P>I am going to relate an extremely recent experience and hopefully a light 
bulb will come on in your heads and you'll go, "Yeah, that's what's missing. Now 
I see! I have been heeeeeled! I see the Light!" 
<P>We had lots of our girl's teams play in the preliminary rounds of an AAU 
tourney this weekend. One of my teams played in the 14 and Under age bracket. I 
had 12, 13, and 14 year olds playing as a team against 14 year olds. I really 
didn't care if we won or lost because this was our 1st game as a team. They 
wanted to play, so we played. 
<P>In our Learning Sessions these girls are learning crossovers, behind the back 
dribbling, spin moves and lots of ball handling skills. I thought that at least 
we could protect the ball and move it down the court. We have spent eternity 
learning some of these skills and to watch them in practice makes your heart 
skip a beat. Some of them are really good at it. 
<P>Our 1st game was against a team my daughter's team had played against several 
times before. (Even though my daughter is now in 9th grade, with the way AAU 
counts a players age, most of my players were the same age as this team, just a 
different grade.) Anyway, I knew the team and what they could and would do. I 
also knew that we would lose and lose big. But that's OK, we were there to play 
our 1st game and have fun. 
<P>Once we were at the game I realized I didn't have enough players to play a 
game. I went to the other coach, forfeited, and told him if he wanted to play, I 
could move some of my girls from another team on to this one and we would give 
him a practice game. We played. 
<P>The score was like 84 to 24, we lost. So where's the light bulb that was 
supposed to appear for you? It's in the describing of our game. In the 32 
minutes we played, from my 7th and 8th graders I saw one crossover, no behind 
the backs, and zero spin moves by my girls. They would dribble right handed, 
head down, right into 3 defenders, sound familiar? 
<P>Let me repeat, 1 crossover, zero behind the backs, and ZERO spin moves! My 
players had the ability to leave their defenders in the dust, but never used the 
skills. Why???? 
<P>In our post game talk, one of my players said to my daughter, "That was a 
neat move when you drove by that girl. What was it?" 
<P>My daughter replied, "A spin move!" 
<P>The younger player thought for a moment and said, "Oh, so that's when you use 
it!" 
<P>LIGHTBULB!!!!! "Oh, so that's when you use it!" I know you folks are smarter 
than I am, so you probably already know what I am about to say. Not only should 
I have taught them the skills, but I should have taught them when to apply them 
and why!!!!! 
<P>So from here on, I never want to hear "Oh, so that's when you use it," 
because I forgot to teach them. 

<h2><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Chapter 20">Chapter 20</a> - ESPN Sportcenter Syndrome</font></h2>

    <P>You and your child are watching ESPN Sportscenter and you see these short 
news bites. Allen Iverson gets the NBA's MVP  award. A little bit ago you saw 
where he was arrested for having a gun in his car. You see a pro-football 
player arrested and charged with murder. You hear the announcers laugh as 
they show a clip of Shaq trying to shoot a free throw. You see replay after 
replay of Allen Iverson driving down the lane and getting his head taken off 
by some monstrous forward, and the announcers say, "That's one way to stop 
him." They show a clip on some college kid who made five 3-pointers. Or a 
player who takes off from the free throw line and stuffs one. Coaches, this 
type of publicity is already the bane of youth sports and basketball is 
leading the charge.

<P>There is a girl who played off-season for me for the last 4 years. She was 
one of those players who gave you everything she had, every moment she was on 
the court. She was well on her way to playing ball at a major high school. 
Over the last year I started noticing she was taking more and more 3 
pointers, and working the ball inside less and less. In her last game of the 
off-season, she took over fifteen 3-point shots....and only made one.  

<P>OK, Ed, so she had an off day. How do you keep the rest of your team focused 
and playing team ball, when they watch her? Even when I bench her for not 
listening to me, the damage has been done. And what is it that she is really 
doing wrong? That's what you see on ESPN, isn't it? 

<P>Let's look at this aspect of it. Another player on your team is wide open 
under the basket for a lay-up, and Miss 3-pointer won't pass to her because 
she HERSELF is open for the three. So how does the open player feel about 
Miss 3-pointer now? Teamwork and team spirit is rapidly deteriorating. It 
doesn't take much of this before your whole team is so brain damaged that you 
might as well blast and rebuild. 

<P>Basketball is about 5 people acting together as a team to achieve a common 
goal. It is not about imitating the plays on Sportscenter. So what do you do, 
tell the parents to stay away from watching it in front of your players? Yes, 
that's exactly what I would ask them to do.  Next, correct the behavior 
whenever it occurs, LS or in a game. You don't wait until it happens twice. 
You WJE them immediately = whistle, ask them to justify their behavior, and 
then explain the correct thing to do. If it continues, then they run laps in 
your LS. If it happens in a game, then they lose playing time. This is about 
as serious a problem as there is in today's youth sports. Do not accept any 
form of this behavior as being even semi-OK.<P>The real controversy is this, NBA players are role models for today's young 
players, whether they want to be or not. These players signed big money 
contracts to play ball. Their contracts don't say anything about being a role 
model. They get paid to play. BUT.......with their faces and athleticism 
splattered all over our TV screens, they are definitely a lot of today's 
youth's role models.  

<P>Please don't misunderstand me, there are an awful lot of NBA players who are 
great role models. The problem is that these players aren't the ones you hear 
of or see. We hear about Sprewell choking his coach, or Iverson arrested, or 
Rodman being his usual bad-boy self. We just don't hear about the good 
things. Just as I'm sure that Sprewell, Iverson, and Rodman do their share of 
good things, YOU JUST DON'T HEAR ABOUT IT because it's not newsworthy.  

<P>When you originally signed up to coach your child's team, you never thought 
that you would have to contend with ESPN sensationalism, did you? Folks, I'm 
here to tell you that it starts as early as 4th grade. You tell a player not 
to take that long distance shot because they have a teammate open under the 
basket, right? They go home and watch players make 7 million a year and do 
what you just told them not to do. This can be just a little bit confusing 
for little Johnny or Susie, don't you think? 

<P>A classic example: you spend a lot of time teaching your players to shoot the 
right way, and then they watch Shaq make over $100,000,000 and he still can't 
shoot a free throw to save his soul. What's wrong with this picture??? 

<P>I don't blame the NBA players. They get paid for playing, not for living up 
to my expectations. I don't blame their coaches, or the General Mgrs. I'm 
just telling you that this is one of those things in life that just exist, 
and you will have to deal with it at some point in time.  

<P>There's more than one way to skin a cat. and my way is just one of many. I 
discourage my players from watching sports on TV I discourage the parents 
from doing the same. And my players all sign a team contract before they ever 
set foot on my basketball floor. If I have a problem, I will counsel the 
player several times. Then I meet with them and their parents and discuss the 
problem. If that gets me nowhere, then I kick them off the team and start 
looking for a replacement. I will not allow cancerous attitudes to fester on 
my team. 

<P>Now for those of you who can't kick a kid off of your team, control the their 
playing time. Cancerous attitude means less playing time. The greater the 
attitude, the less the playing time. Make sure you document the attitude and 
lack of cooperation of the player. Then inform the refs before each game. 
Also inform the head of your program, be it a school's Athletic Director or 
the head of your club. Document everything and this way it won't come back to 
haunt you. 

<P>If you want your TEAM to succeed, if you want basketball to remain a fun game 
for your players, if you don't want to become even more of an alcoholic, then 
be prepared to handle the E.S.S. = ESPN Sportscenter Syndrome. If you don't 
control it, IT WILL CONTROL YOU!!!!  

<h2><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Chapter 21">Chapter 21</a> Multiple Teams? Here's Your Tylenol!</font></h2>

<p><i>by Ed Riley copyright 2002</i></p>

<p>Am I doing better at the length of these chapters? I had an overwhelming number 
of e-mails requesting shorter chapters so you could read them on your lunch 
break, in between helping your child with their homework and playing on the 
computer, etc. So this is why the chapters are so short. (That and I get 
typer's cramp.)

<p>We started a basketball academy. Our goals are to 
teach girls 4th-11th grade girls and to improve their game. My partner 
started with 9 kids, 2 years a go. I joined him last September and we went 
to 40 girls. January we went to 80, now we have 120 that we know of. Every 
week new players just show up. We're like rabbits out of control, we 
probably have close to 30 players that we know nothing about. We ask who 
they are, and they say they came with that girl, as they point to someone in 
a drill line of 20 players. 

<p>Next, we only have 5 coaches to handle this. 
Only 3 coaches handle all of these player's skills Learning Session. All 5 
handle their own team Learning Sessions. 

<p>We are in a 3 game minimum tourney this weekend, with 10 teams. In the beginning, 
I was counting on having 8 players for my 8th grade team. Yesterday I had 14 show up for the 
games. Another coach had originally planned on 10 of his high school 
players showing up, only 7 showed. We borrowed players from other teams to 
fill in. 

<p>So what can you learn from this? 

<p><b>Riley's Rules based on Riley's Mistakes. </b>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you know your own priorities and goals. Is 
your priority to teach your players, play games, win, whatever.... </li>
<li>Make sure you surround yourself with teachers of the game with the 
same priorities as yours. I.E. A coach who just wants to handpick his team 
and win, doesn't fit the description of a basketball ACADEMY! There's 
nothing wrong with select coaches, but they don't fit into an Academy. Remember, 
this is for clubs with multiple teams. </li>
<li>Figure out the number of players you can comfortably handle. Then figure out if you can 
say "Sorry, we're full," to that little face who really wants to learn and 
play. My partner and I can't say no. So have emergency gym time lined up as 
well as extra coaches. </li>
<li>Make sure your wife, husband, or significant other is singing from the same song book as 
you are. If they don't have the patience of a saint, you're screwed if you take on too much! </li>
<li>Make sure you don't let yourself become a baby sitter. Kids should be picked up 
on time. You won't have time to baby-sit players with attitudes. Cut out any 
cancerous attitudes, you don't have time to correct them. </li>
<li>Make sure your players have the same goals as your program, if not, cut the tie that binds. </li>
<li>Collect your money up front, and keep great records. When you 
receive $$, write it down immediately. </li>
<li>Communicate via e-mail when possible. God, this is a must. I type one message to all 70 pre-high 
schoolers, click on send and I avoided 70 phone calls. </li>
<li>Keep reminding your players and their parents of your goals and your expectations 
of them. </li>
<li>Don't take your frustrations out on your players. Trust me, 
it is so easy to do so. Your big, they're small, just have patience! </li>
<li>Don't let your ego or pride keep you from admitting a mistake. When 
you screw up, hold your hand up in the air and admit it. (It's good exercise 
for your arms.) Learn from your mistakes and go on with life! </li>
<li>Don't be thin skinned, or don't start this project in the first place. You 
are the head of the program, so be prepared to walk around with a bullseye 
on your back. When anything goes wrong, you are to blame, whether it's 
justified or not. </li>
<li>Last, but not least, buy stock in whatever 
relaxing hobbies you have. I just bought stock in Absolute, ar, ar!!!!!!</li>

<p>If you have any questions, I now have a website with a discussion board where 
you can ask questions and get several coaches to answer them. The address is <a href="http://www.coachingyouthbasketball.net">

<h2><font color="#0000FF"><a name="Chapter 22">Basketball's Greatest Mysteries</a>, Including Teamwork</font></h2>
<p><i>by Ed Riley and a lot of friends, copyright 2002</i></p>
<p>
Since the dawn of time, (don'tcha just luv the way I started off so 
official-like?), people have asked the "W" questions, who, what, where, why, 
when, and are We there yet. Why does the govt. tax us so much? What happened 
to that guy's hair? Who is that person across the room? When do I get off 
work? You, know, the "W" questions.
<p>
Basketball is no exception. There are a gazillion basketball mysteries to 
explore. I asked a few of my e-friends to chip in and we have come up with a 
partial list of these mysterious unknowns. It's been a little slow on the 
discussion board, our book has been serious for too long, so here's a little 
basketball fun fer yea.

Why is it that everytime coaches instruct their players to shoot within 10-12 
feet at halftime, one of their players launches a three within the first 10 
seconds of the first possession which elicits an instructional "No, that shot 
is too far....." from the coach as the three is drained. Eyes rollback in the 
coaches head and he stops in midstatement and gives that player a smiling 
glare and they both know everything is ok. From Ed's Old Buddy of past 
firepower days, Dave

did that idiot take HER out?". by Coach Mac
<p>
The worst passer on your team will always want to throw the ball in on your 
inbounds plays. by Coach Mac

ideas on how. It's obvious that what we are doing isn't working, so why don't 
you follow up with HOW to do it?" by b-ball ed
