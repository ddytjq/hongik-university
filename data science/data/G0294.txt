DIRBE Images</h1>

<hr>The images shown below were created from the COBE <a href="dirbe_products.html">DIRBE
data products </a>. The colors generally do not map linearly into sky brightness.
Use the original data products for quantitative analysis. Additional images
are available in the <a href="slide_captions.html">COBE Slide Set</a>.

<br>1.25, 2.2, and 3.5 micron Solar elongation angle = 90 deg Maps - Galactic
coordinate Mollweide projection maps of the entire sky as seen by the DIRBE
at a fixed angle relative to the Sun. Stars concentrated in the Galactic
plane (horizontal feature) dominate the images at these wavelengths. Dust
in the Milky Way absorbs and scatters starlight, producing the dark band
that runs through the Galactic center in the 1.25 micron image; this "extinction"
effect diminishes with increasing wavelength.

<br>False-color image of the near-infrared sky as seen by the DIRBE. Data
at 1.25, 2.2, and 3.5 &micro;m wavelengths are represented respectively
as blue, green and red colors. The image is presented in Galactic coordinates,
with the plane of the Milky Way Galaxy horizontal across the middle and
the Galactic center at the center. The dominant sources of light at these
wavelengths are stars within our Galaxy. The image shows both the thin
disk and central bulge populations of stars in our spiral galaxy. Our Sun,
much closer to us than any other star, lies in the disk (which is why the
disk appears edge-on to us) at a distance of about 28,000 light years from
the center. The image is redder in directions where there is more dust
between the stars absorbing starlight from distant stars. This absorption
is so strong at visible wavelengths that the central part of the Milky
Way cannot be seen. DIRBE data will facilitate studies of the content,
energetics and large scale structure of the Galaxy, as well as the nature
and distribution of dust within the Solar System. The data also will be
studied for evidence of a faint, uniform infrared background, the residual
radiation from the first stars and galaxies formed following the Big Bang.
For more information about the Milky Way at wavelengths ranging across
the entire electromagnetic spectrum, see the <a href="http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/mw">Multiwavelength
Milky Way</a> web site.

<br><a href="e90_4567.gif">4.9, 12, 25, and 60 micron Solar elongation
angle = 90 deg Maps </a>- Thermal emission from star-heated dust in the
Milky Way and interplanetary dust heated by the Sun dominates the images
at these wavelengths. The S-shaped feature is the ecliptic plane, in which,
like the planets, the interplanetary dust is concentrated. The oval-shaped
brightness discontinuity is an artefact of the way the maps were prepared,
not a feature in the infrared sky. Specifically, the discontinuity corresponds
to a path difference through the interplanetary dust cloud as adjacent
positions in the sky were observed from DIRBE's vantage point in Earth
orbit with the Earth on opposite sides of the Sun.

dust warmed by stars in the Milky Way dominates at these wavelengths. At
high Galactic latitudes, interstellar "cirrus" clouds are apparent. Emission
from the solar system dust ("zodiacal emission") is strongest at 25 microns
but remains in evidence in the 100 micron image, and to a lesser degree
at the longer wavelengths.

The zodiacal and Galactic emission must be precisely modeled and subtracted
in order to detect the relatively faint Cosmic Infrared Background which
the DIRBE was designed to find. Secondary DIRBE objectives include studies
of these astrophysical foreground components.

of the DIRBE mission over the period during which the COBE cryogen supply
lasted. As the Earth, with COBE in orbit, revolved around the Sun, DIRBE
viewed the sky from an ever-changing vantage point in the solar system,
enabling light reflected and emitted by the interplanetary dust cloud to
be modeled.

<br><a href="tod_scan_b8.gif">DIRBE scan track superposed on 100 micron
Annual Average Map and 100 micron intensity from the corresponding segment
of Time-ordered Data </a>- DIRBE scanned the sky in a helical pattern that
resulted from the spin and orbital motion of the COBE satellite and the
"look direction" of the telescope, which was 30 degrees from the spin axis.
The scan segment depicted covers two COBE spin cycles, or about 150 seconds,
during a time when the DIRBE field of view swept through the Sco-Oph region
(bright area above the Galactic center in the figure) and passed near the
North Galactic Pole, where the emission is faint. The brightness of the
sky at 100 microns measured during this interval is shown as a graph of
intensity <i>vs.</i> time, as given in the DIRBE <a href="http://space.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/cobe/dirbe_products.html#tod">Time-ordered
Data product</a>. On the abscissa, the unit of time is 1/8th of a second.
A related <a href="tod_b3_6_8_10_scans.gif">gif image </a>shows intensity
<i>vs.</i> time at four wavelengths - 3.5, 25, 100, and 240 microns - during
the same period. Zodiacal emission is evident at 25 and 100 microns; the
bumps at about 470 and 1040 time units correspond to ecliptic plane crossings.
Stars give rise to the spikes seen at 3.5 microns. The signal-to-noise
ratio is clearly worse at 240 microns than at the other wavelengths.
<p>The following two figures were provided by Dr. Henry T. Freudenreich
and are described in his paper on <i>The Shape and Color of the Galactic
Disk</i> (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1996ApJ...468..663F">
1996, ApJ, 468, 663</a>). The Galactic plane runs horizontally through
each figure. The Galactic center lies along the 0 degree meridian and the
anti-center direction appears near the left side of each map. The 90 degree
meridian is labeled for scale.

<br>J-K and 240 &micro;m Maps
<br><b>Top:</b> A sky map of the ratio of the surface brightness in the
DIRBE J band (1.25 &micro;m) to the surface brightness in the DIRBE K band
(2.2 &micro;m), after the zodiacal light has been subtracted. The range
is 0.8 to 1.4. Starlight dominates the sky brightness at these wavelengths.
The darker areas in this image exhibit the light scattering and absorbing
effects of interstellar dust; those effects are greater at shorter wavelengths.
<p><b>Bottom:</b> The surface brightness at 240 &micro;m. At this wavelength,
in the far-infrared, stars are invisible and we see thermal emission from
dust heated by starlight. The range of surface brightness is 0 to 115 MJy/sr.
This map is bright where the top map is dark because the same interstellar
dust clouds that absorb background starlight at near-infrared wavelengths
are warmed by this absorption to about 20 degrees Kelvin, making them sources
of far-infrared emission.
<p><a href="K_L.gif"><img SRC="K_L_wallet.gif" ALT="[Image of DIRBE data]" height=127 width=127></a>
<br>K-L and 240 &micro;m Maps
<br><b>Top:</b> A sky map of the ratio of the surface brightness in the
DIRBE K band (2.2 &micro;m) to the surface brightness in the DIRBE L band
(3.5 &micro;m), after the zodiacal light has been subtracted. The range
is 1.5 to 2.1. This map is darker where there is more dust along the line
of sight, like the J-K map, but it also shows filamentary structure absent
from the J-K map, a sign of dust emission at 3.5 &micro;m, which requires
a temperature of nearly 1000 Kelvins. An ultraviolet photon could heat
a large molecule (<i>e.g.,</i> a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, or PAH),
or a very small dust grain to such a temperature.
<p><b>Bottom:</b> The surface brightness at 240 &micro;m multiplied by
the sine of the Galactic latitude. This procedure accentuates the relatively
nearby interstellar clouds, such as the molecular clouds in Orion (lower
far left), Taurus (to the right of Orion) and Ophiuchus (above Galactic
center). When scaled by the sine of latitude, the map intensity ranges
from 0 to 13 MJy/sr. Comparison of this map to the K-L map shows that regions
containing cool dust tend to coincide with regions containing hot, small
dust grains. The molecules or tiny grains seem to be a general component
of the interstellar dust.
