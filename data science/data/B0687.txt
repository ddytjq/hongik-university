  	  <div class="body2"><b>THE FINANCIAL OMBUDSMAN SERVICE</b><br><br>Taking your banking or loan complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service<br><br><b>HOW WE CAN HELP YOU</b><br><br>&#0149 About the Financial Ombudsman Service <br>&#0149 What banking and loan complaints can the Financial Ombudsman Service deal with? <br>&#0149 Who can make a complaint? <br>&#0149 Can we deal with all complaints about banking or loans? <br>&#0149 Are there any time limits? <br>&#0149 Does the firm have to consider the complaint before we can get involved? <br>&#0149 You’ve received a final response letter from the firm and you’re not happy. What happens now? <br>&#0149 What happens next? <br>&#0149 Is taking a complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service like going to court? <br>&#0149 Do you need the help of a solicitor or other adviser to present your case to us? <br>&#0149 Will we need to contact other people about your case? <br><br><b>About the Financial Ombudsman Service </b><br>Our job is to resolve individual disputes between customers and financial firms, such as banks and building societies. Our service is free for customers and is an informal alternative to the courts. <br><br>We are independent and decide each case impartially on its own merits. But you must have complained to the firm first, before we can get involved. If you have already complained to the firm and are not happy with the outcome, we can consider your case. <br><br>If we decide that the firm has acted wrongly and you have lost out as a result, we can tell the firm how to put things right for you. Generally, our aim is to put you in the position you’d be in if things hadn’t gone wrong. This might include telling the firm to make good your losses. Our decisions are usually binding on the firm, up to a maximum of £100,000. <br><br>On the other hand, if we think the firm has treated you fairly or is already offering adequate compensation, we will tell you so. <br><br>We do not have the power to make general rules for financial firms. And we cannot give personal advice about financial matters. <br><br>Currently, the rules that apply to complaints against banks differ slightly from the rules that apply to complaints against building societies. These rules will be replaced by a single set of Financial Ombudsman Service rules towards the end of 2001. <br><br>What banking and loan complaints can the Financial Ombudsman Service deal with? <br>We can deal with complaints about something a bank or building society did (or failed to do) in relation to: <br><br>&#0149 current accounts <br>&#0149 savings and deposit accounts <br>&#0149 mortgages and other loans <br>&#0149 credit cards <br>&#0149 executor and trustee services <br>&#0149 some insurance, financial or taxation advice. <br><br>This includes the sale of endowment and pension policies by banks and building societies before 29 April 1988. The law changed on 29 April 1988. Endowment and pension policies sold after this date are treated as investments, and are covered by a separate leaflet – taking your investment complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service. <br><br>Most banks and all building societies are covered by the ombudsman service – but not other lenders or mortgage brokers. If you are unsure whether the firm you have been dealing with was covered by the ombudsman service at the relevant time, please contact us. Our contact details are on the back of this leaflet. <br><br><b>Who can make a complaint? </b><br>We can consider complaints from individuals, businesses, companies or associations – whether they are based in the United Kingdom or abroad. <br><br>This includes a complaint from a customer, or from someone who: <br>• applied to be a customer and was refused <br>• gave a guarantee or security <br>• relied on a cheque guarantee card in accepting a cheque <br>• owned a cheque that the firm credited to someone not entitled to it <br>• received a bank reference or status opinion <br>• was a beneficiary where the firm is trustee, executor or administrator. <br><br>For building societies:<br>&#0149 We may be able to consider complaints from other non-customers <br>&#0149 If the complaint is from a business, company or association, its latest yearly turnover must be under £1 million <br><br>For banks:<br>&#0149 If the complaint is from a limited company, its latest yearly turnover must be under £1 million - and the problem must have occurred after 25 January 1993. <br><br>In both cases, if the company is part of a group, it is the group turnover that must be under £1 million. <br><br><b>Can we deal with all complaints about banking or loans? </b><br>We can only deal with complaints about services provided by banks and building societies in (or from) the United Kingdom. This covers England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland – but not the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. <br><br>We may be able to deal with transactions abroad using a credit, debit or cash card that was issued in the United Kingdom. <br><br>There are some kinds of complaints we cannot deal with. <br>For example, we cannot deal with complaints about: <br>&#0149 a mistake that has not caused loss or material inconvenience <br>&#0149 things that have been (or are being) dealt with by a court <br>&#0149 a firm taking legal action against you, or how it acts in court <br>&#0149 the way the United Kingdom banking system operates. <br><br>In particular, we do not deal with complaints about the way in which a firm exercised its commercial judgement unless there was maladministration. <br>&#0149 Commercial judgement includes, for example, whether or not to give someone an account, a loan or a credit card – and the terms applied. <br>&#0149 Maladministration includes a material mistake, undue delay, improper discrimination or failure to follow proper procedures. <br><br>And we cannot reduce fees or interest that is charged properly under the terms of the account. <br><br>If a building society becomes a bank, members sometimes receive benefits (such as free shares). Our powers in these cases are very limited. In particular, we cannot consider complaints about the conditions members have to fulfil in order to qualify for benefits. <br><br><b>Are there any time limits? </b><br>For building societies, we cannot handle a complaint if you delay too long in bringing it to us after discovering the problem. Unless there are special reasons, we may treat anything more than six months (less any time the building society was considering your complaint) as too long. And we may close our file if you delay too long in providing us with evidence or information we ask for. <br><br>For banks, we cannot handle a complaint if you bring it to us more than:<br>&#0149 six months after the bank gave you its final response to your complaint and told you about the ombudsman service <br>&#0149 six years after the event you are complaining about (or six years after the date when, taking reasonable care, you could have discovered the event you are complaining about). <br><br><b>Does the firm have to consider the complaint before we can get involved? </b><br>Yes. Many problems are the result of misunderstandings or simple administrative errors. So it makes sense to give the firm a fair chance to sort out your complaint. In many cases, the firm will be able to put things right at an early stage, without any need for us to get involved. <br><br>Ask the firm for details of its complaints procedure. You will need to follow this, as we cannot deal with your complaint before the firm has had the opportunity to sort out the problem. If you bring your case to us before you have complained to the firm, we can send your complaint on to the firm for you. <br><br>After the firm has investigated the matter fully, it should send you a final response letter (which it might call a deadlock letter). This will explain the outcome of the firm’s investigation. The letter should also tell you about your right to bring your complaint to the ombudsman, if you are still not happy. <br><br>The firm may offer you compensation. This may be because the firm believes it is in the wrong. Or it may be to maintain goodwill, even though the firm thinks it is in the right. If you bring the complaint to us, we make our own decision about whether or not the firm was wrong. An offer of compensation by the firm does not guarantee that we will uphold your complaint or award you at least that amount. <br> <br><b>You’ve received a final response letter from the firm and you’re not happy. What happens now? </b><br>If you’re not happy with what the firm says in its final response letter, we may be able to step in. We may also be able to help if the firm hasn’t sent you its final response letter promptly – within eight weeks or so of your first complaining to the firm. <br><br>Please use our complaint form to give us your personal details and information about your complaint – including what you would like the firm to do to put matters right. <br><br>You can get our complaint form by phoning us on 0845 766 0902. We may be able to fill in some of the details for you over the phone. <br><br>When you receive the form, please complete the details and check that all the information we need is included. Then sign it and return it to us – enclosing a copy of the firm’s final response letter and copies of any documents relevant to your complaint. <br><br>If the complaint is from a limited company (or, in the case of a building society complaint, a business or association) attach a copy of the latest annual accounts – or other evidence of the turnover (such as the last year’s VAT returns). <br><br><b>What happens next? </b><br>If your complaint is something we have the power to deal with, we will usually start by seeing if we can help you and the firm resolve matters in an informal way. One of our staff (usually called a caseworker) will take a fresh look at the facts and let you and the firm know how we think you could reach agreement. This approach is often called mediation. <br><br>If we cannot resolve the complaint in this way and we don’t consider that the firm has already offered you adequate compensation, one of our staff (usually called an adjudicator) will begin an investigation into your complaint. The adjudicator will call for any relevant paperwork that is needed from the firm, and may request documents and information from other people and firms as well. We might well also need more information from you. <br><br>Once the adjudicator has completed the investigation (having consulted an ombudsman where necessary), we will send you and the firm our conclusions about how the complaint should be resolved. <br><br>A formal decision by an ombudsman is final. Firms usually have to accept our decisions. But you don’t have to accept any decision we make. You are free to go to court instead. However, we cannot give legal advice about how a court would handle your case or about any court requirements you might need to comply with. <br><br><b>Is taking a complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service like going to court? </b><br>No. We handle complaints in a different way from the courts. We generally decide cases on the basis of paperwork provided by you and the firm. We resolve most complaints without the need for face-to-face meetings or hearings. <br><br>If you want to inspect all the papers personally, ask your own questions or have a hearing as a matter of course – our informal procedures are not for you. You would be better to take your complaint to court instead. <br><br><b>Do you need the help of a solicitor or other adviser to present your case to us? </b><br>No. You shouldn’t need any legal or financial expertise to bring a case to us. <br><br>If you do decide to employ a professional (for example, a solicitor or financial adviser) then you will almost certainly have to pay their costs yourself. Don’t expect to get these costs back, even if we decide your complaint is valid. <br><br><b>Will we need to contact other people about your case? </b><br>To deal with your complaint effectively, we may need to be able to exchange information about the case with other relevant organisations. However, we take care to handle all personal details with sensitivity and discretion. <br><br>To help us get to the bottom of your complaint, we will ask the firm for its views on the case. We will also ask the firm to send us any relevant paperwork that is needed. Sometimes we might send some of this information on to you. We may also send the firm information that you have given us, if we think this might help resolve matters more quickly.<br><br>To help in staff training we may monitor or record phone calls. We can help if you need information in a different format (eg Braille, audiotape etc) or in a different language.
