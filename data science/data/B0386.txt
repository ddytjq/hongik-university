        under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Payments under the

        of an investor's total shares and/or deposits, and 90% of the next &pound;33,000.

        Procedure and the Financial Ombudsman Service</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Cumberland Building
        Society has a formal complaints procedure, which is explained on this
        page. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are also subject
        to the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service. In general terms this
        gives customers who are unable to resolve a complaint against us the right
        to have this reviewed by an independent person - the Ombudsman.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We hope that our complaints
        procedure will resolve any complaint without the need for you to contact
        the Financial Ombudsman Service. Please note that the Financial Ombudsman
        Service will not investigate your complaint before you have exhausted
        the Society's complaints procedure, and received a letter from the Society
        giving its final response.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        <b>Our Complaints Procedure</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. If you have a problem
        relating to the Society, please discuss this with one of our branch staff.
        Alternatively, you can telephone our head office Investment Customer Services
        or Mortgage and Insurance departments on 01228 541341. Our aim is to deal
        with your problem sympathetically, fairly and quickly.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. If you feel that
        the matter is not being resolved to your satisfaction, please ask to speak
        to the manager of the branch or the head office department dealing with
        your enquiry. The manager will try to resolve the matter on the day you
        raise your complaint, although whether this is possible will of course
        depend on the nature of your complaint.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. If the response
        by our branch or head office department manager does not resolve the matter
        to your satisfaction, by the fourth working day following the day you
        raised the matter, a letter of acknowledgement will be sent to you. This
        will also:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">give the name and
          job title of the person handling your complaint from this point onwards,
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">set out our understanding
          of your complaint, </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">and state when
          we will be able to reply in greater detail.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You may also be asked
        for additional information if this is required to assist in resolving
        the matter.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
        4. If you are dissatisfied with the response from our branch or head office
        department manager, please then write to the Investment Controller or
        Mortgage Administration Controller at Cumberland Building Society, Cumberland
        House, Castle Street, Carlisle CA3 8RX. You should include full details
        of your complaint and any action you would like us to take to resolve
        your complaint.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. If your problem
        has still not been resolved, please write to The Secretary, Cumberland
        Building Society, Cumberland House, Castle Street, Carlisle CA3 8RX. Your
        letter should state why you are dissatisfied and what further action you
        wish us to take to fully resolve your complaint. The Secretary will fully
        investigate your complaint as quickly as possible.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. However, we will
        (in accordance with the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service) within
        four weeks of receiving your complaint, send you either our final response,
        or a holding response explaining why we cannot yet give our final response.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7. In all but very
        exceptional cases, by the end of eight weeks following receipt of your
        complaint, the Society will have given you its final response by letter.
        This will be accompanied by the Financial Ombudsman Service's explanatory
        leaflet.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8. If you are still
        not satisfied with the steps taken by the Society and its final response
        letter, you can write to the Financial Ombudsman Service, South Quay Plaza,
        183 Marsh Wall, London E14 9SR (telephone: 020 7964 1000, e-mail: enquiries@financial-ombudsman.org.uk).
        Your letter should give details of your complaint and enclose copies of
        correspondence you have had with the Society, and any other relevant documents.
        You should also tell the Ombudsman that you have followed the Society's
        Complaints Procedure but you are unhappy with the outcome.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Please note that
        the Ombudsman cannot investigate your complaint until we have given you
        our final response letter, unless we have not done this within eight weeks
        following receipt of your complaint.</b> In these very exceptional cases,
        we will write to you to explain why this has not been possible, indicate
        when we expect to be able to make a final response, inform you that you
        may refer the matter to the Financial Ombudsman Service, and enclose a
        copy of its explanatory leaflet.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">9. The Financial Ombudsman
        Service will consider your complaint taking into account any points made
        by you and the Society. The Financial Ombudsman Service may however, refuse
        to investigate a complaint where you have not contacted them within six
        months of the Society's final response letter, to tell them you are still
        dissatisfied.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">10. Having investigated
        a complaint, the Financial Ombudsman Service will decide whether it agrees
        with your complaint and whether any further action is necessary. A date
        will be set by which you must respond to the Ombudsman's decision. If
        you do accept the decision within this time limit, it is normally final
        and binding on both yourself and the Society although in exceptional circumstances
        the matter may be open to judicial review. If you do not respond within
        the stated time limit, or do not accept the Ombudsman's decision, then
        the Society is not bound by it. </font><br>
