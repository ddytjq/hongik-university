<dt><a name="asteroid ephemeris and masses"><b>Asteroid Ephemerides and Masses</b></a>
<dd><p><img src="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/graphics/ida.gif" align=right width=240 height=125> An extensive set
of observations, some going back into
the 19th century, have been analyzed to provide
<a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/hilton/ephemerides/USNOAE98/USNOAE98.html">new
ephemerides and masses</a> of some of the largest
<a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/murison/asteroids/" target="_top">asteroids</a>.  These
new asteroid ephemerides will be used in the <i>Astronomical Almanac</i> for
years 2000 and beyond.  Additionally, all asteroids that have measurable
gravitational effects on their neighbors are being studied for possible
mass determinations; the feasibility of such determinations depends on
the strength of the dynamical interactions and the availability of good
historical observations. There are, currently, a
<a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/hilton/asteroid_masses.htm">dozen asteroids
which have masses that have been determined</a>, and there are about nine others
whose masses can be determined from ground based techniques.
A <a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/ephemerides/asteroid/masses/PressRelease.htm">
press release</a> on the masses and densities of the three largest asteroids,
derived from this work, was issued at the American Astronomical
Society meeting in January 1998.</p>
<p>Another aspect of researching historical observations of asteroids is learning how
asteroids came to be recognized as a
<a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/hilton/AsteroidHistory/minorplanets.html">class of
objects</a> separate from the planets.</p>

Orbits for all known <a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/murison/TNOs/" target="_top">Trans-Neptunian
Objects</a> (TNOs) have been re-calculated in an effort to increase
our understanding of the dynamical relationships between these objects
and the major planets.  These relationships (resonances) are important
in understanding the history of these difficult-to-observe objects,
of which Pluto is the largest example.  TNOs may be closely
related to comets as well as many of the moons of the outer planets.</p>

(An Extensible Symbolic Optics Package), which is a computer algebra
ray tracing program written in the Maple symbolic algebra language;
and RayTrace, a numerical program written in C++.  Both approaches are
optimized for studying optical path length (OPL) variations as a function
of optic misalignment perturbations.  OPL resolution is in the sub-femtometer
regime (RayTrace) or better (AESOP) over total path lengths on the
order 10 meters.  These programs are used to analyze, for example,
astrometric interferometers like FAME or

<dd><p>Astrometric observation reductions fit into one of two broad
categories:  the approach based on angles, used for optical
observations, and the approach based on interferometric delay, used for
VLBI observations.  A procedure by which VLBI algorithms can be used for optical
observations has been developed and implemented in software.  This
scheme has allowed a large number of numerical tests to be performed,
providing practical information on the differences between angle-based and
delay-based algorithms.  This work is described in a
<a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/reports/ghk97a.pdf">poster (PDF)</a>

<dt><a name="star formation studies"><b>Star Formation Studies</b></a>
<dd><p>To address the basic question of how star formation is generated
in galaxies which lack dominate triggering mechanisms such as spiral
density waves, a modest study of dwarf galaxies is taking place.
Ultraviolet images of dwarf galaxies taken with the Ultraviolet Imaging
Telescope (<a href="http://trifle.gsfc.nasa.gov/UIT/" target="_top">UIT</a>)
are used to identify characteristic patterns of recent,
high-mass star formation. This sample of galaxies is interesting in that
they exhibit intriguing hole-like structures in the neutral H I
gas, another possible link to the star formation activity. This
comparative study is allowing us to identify what influences
star formation on global and local scales in these tiny irregular
galaxies. These influences are applicable to star formation in all
types of galaxies to some extent.

<dt><a name="solar diameter"><b>Solar Diameter Measurements</b></a>
<dd><p><img src="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/graphics/eclipse4.jpg" align=left width=134 height=111>
Since the late 1970s solar physicists have been very interested in whether the
Sun is actually a variable star.  There are several techniques by which the
diameter of the Sun may be measured.  One that is especially sensitive is
through observation of Baily's Bead phenomena at the time of a central solar
eclipse.  The Astronomical Applications Department has unique capabilities to
predict these events and reduce the observations.  A program to observe solar eclipses for
this purpose was begun in 1979, along with a program to collect similar
observations from the astronomical literature for eclipses going back to 1715
and reduce them all on a common reference system. The resulting series of
measurements of the solar diameter would be used to calibrate measurements
currently being taken from space, and also to correlate the solar diameter
to climatological data in the NOAA archives going back 150 years or more.
This series of observations may also contribute to evaluating the
precision of the ephemerides and the long-term study of the rotation of
the Earth.</p>

<dt><a name="celestial navigation"><b>Celestial Navigation</b></a>
<dd><p><img src="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/graphics/celnav.gif" align=right width=273 height=223>
As part of a Navy software project,
<a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/research/celnav.html">new algorithms
for celestial navigation</a> have been developed.  These algorithms
are based on the solution to a familiar astronomical problem -
determining the orbit of a body from a series of observations.  In
this case, the body in question is a ship and its orbit is a rhumb-line
track over the spheroidal surface of the Earth.  Given suitably accurate
observing systems, these algorithms would provide sight
reduction and positional fixes at the one arcsecond (30 meter) level of
precision.</p>
<br clear="all">

<dt><a name="satellite observations"><b>Observations of Jupiter's
Satellites</b></a>
<dd><p>During November-December 1998, a series of events
occurred involving the Galilean satellites of Jupiter, where two
satellites (usually Io and Europa, but sometimes Europa and Ganymede)
appeared from Earth to pass within 5 arcseconds of each other.
<img src="http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO26in-1.jpg" height=200 align=left>
This very close spacing allowed these events to be observed with the speckle
interferometry camera attached to the U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO)
<a href="http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO26in.html" target="_top">26-inch
refracting telescope</a>.  The camera and associated software are
normally used by the USNO <a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/"
target="_top">Astrometry Department</a> for very precise measurements of the
relative positions of binary star components.  For the satellite events, the
goal was to obtain very precise relative positions of the satellite pairs at
specific times, as well as the time of apparent closest separation.
In a cooperative project with the Astrometry Department,
4 out of a possible 8 events visible from USNO were successfully
observed. <img src="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/graphics/speckle.jpg" height=150 align=right>
Analysis of these observations is in progress and it remains
to be seen whether the precision of the measurements will be adequate.
Close pairings of the Galilean satellites occur periodically, so if the
technique is useful, more opportunities for similar observations will be
forthcoming.</p>
