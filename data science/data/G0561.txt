<p>
The evolutionary history of a star may be considered a story of the inexorable 
battle of the star against the force of gravity which, once the star begins 
its contraction out of the interstellar medium, attempts to pull it ever 
smaller into a more compact, more tightly bound sphere.  Stars of solar-type 
masses will come to a compromise with gravity as they end their lives as 
compact, dense white dwarf stars with diameter about the size of the earth and
density of order 1 ton/cm<sup>3</sup>.  The most massive stars will lose this 
battle in spectacular fashion.
<p>
<a name="Russell-Vogt"><font size=+2 color="burgundy">
<u>The Russell-Vogt Theorem</u></font></a><p>
It follows that the single most important determinant of the life-history 
for a star is its 
<i>mass</i>; this principle is called the <i>Russell-Vogt Theorem</i>. 
Important mass regimes for stellar evolution:
<ul>
<li> M<sub>*</sub> < 0.01 M<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif"></sub> 
- Planet.  Jupiter, for example, has a mass of about 0.001 x 
M<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif"></sub>.  Jupiter's temperature is
slightly warmer than would be expected from the amount of solar energy it 
receives; this is interpreted as due to gravitational potential energy 
stored as heat from Jupiter's contraction out of the proto-solar nebula.  
But the energy balance for Jupiter and other planets is largely determined 
by the energy received from the sun and central temperatures never come close 
to the 1 million K required for even the simplest nuclear reactions.
<p>
<li> 0.01 M<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif"></sub> < M<sub>*</sub> 
< 0.085 M<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif"></sub> - 
<a href="http://www.bahnhof.se/~davidgr/browndwf/bd_home.html">Brown Dwarf</a>;
these objects will never become hot enough in their cores to ignite the P-P 
Chain.  Release gravitational potential energy will cause them to heat up
to core temperatures as hot as 3 million K, hot enough for the first stages 
of nuclear reactions, perhaps, but never hot enough to establish stable
hydrogen burning.  With atmospheric temperatures 
<i>T<sub>surface</sub> < 2000K, brown dwarfs</i> will be very faint, 
radiating the vast majority of their luminous energy in the infrared, and 
very hard to detect.  A new near-infrared survey of the sky called 2MASS
has detected a large number of cool stars, now classified as 
<a href="http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/gallery/lstar.html"> L-stars</a>
which are likely to be brown dwarfs.  Here's a 
<a href="http://www.seds.org/hst/95-48.html"> press release</a> of another 
possible brown dwarf detected at Palomar and the Hubble Space Telescope.
<p>
<li>0.085 M<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif"></sub> < M<sub>*</sub> 
< 0.4 M<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif"></sub> - these stars will 
be very 
long lived, but will never reach temperatures hot enough for the Triple-alpha 
process to occur.  They will not have a helium flash in the red giant stage 
nor a helium-burning main-sequence phase.
<p>
<li>0.4 M<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif"></sub> < M<sub>*</sub> < 
1.2 M<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif"></sub> - these stars 
like the sun will burn hydrogen to helium via the P-P Chain and will burn 
helium to crabon via the Triple-alpha process following a path through the 
H-R Diagram essentially like that outlined in the <a href="StevI.html">
previous tutorial</a>.
<p>
<li>M<sub>*</sub> > 1.2 M<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif"></sub> - 
these stars will reach high enough core temperatures to burn hydrogen via the 
CNO cycle.
<p>
<li>M<sub>*</sub> > 8 M<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif"></sub> - 
stars 
more massive than about 8 solar masses (this number is very uncertain compared 
with those above) will have a larger number of nuclear burning cycles and 
their cores will be more massive than the limiting mass of 
1.4M<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif"></sub>, the largest mass that 
can be 
supported by electron degeneracy, and thus the largest possible mass for a 
white dwarf.  As we shall see these stars end their lives with a cataclysmic 
explosion called a <i>supernova</i>.
</ul>
<p><center>
<img src="./images/hr_mass.gif"><h3><font color="blue">
As shown in the figure above the place where a star reaches the Main Sequence 
is directly related to the star's mass.

<a name="massive*"><font size=+2 color="burgundy">
<u>Massive Stars</u></font></a><p>
We may crudely distinguish between stars more massive than the sun and solar 
type stars in their evolutionary characteristics:
<ol>
<li>Massive stars live their lives more rapidly than do solar-type stars --
they "live fast and die young."  One can determine relatively 
straightforwardly from the balance between gravity, pressure and temperature
that the luminosity of a star will be approximately 
proportional to the Mass<sup>3.5</sup>.  This is the <i>Mass-Luminosity
Relation</i> which applies to all phases of stellar evolution:
<p><center><h3><font color=red>
L <img src="./images/doodads/propto_r.gif"> M<sup>3.5</sup></h3></font>
</center><p>
Since the available fuel is effectively the mass of the star, the lifetime
will be approximately proportional to 1/Mass<sup>2.5</sup>.  A star of 10 
solar masses can thus be expected to go through its life cycle about 300 times 
faster than the sun, with a main sequence lifetime of about 30 million years.
(The most massive stars have lifetimes shorter than about a million years,
while stars with masses less than about 3/4M<sub>
<img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif"></sub> have lifetimes longer than 
the age of the Universe!)
<p>
<li>As described above massive stars require higher central temperatures to 
balance the greater pull of gravity.  This means that massive stars produce 
helium from hydrogen via the CNO cycle rather than the P-P Chain.
<p>
<li>Higher central temperatures and pressure dictate that the stellar core 
will not become electron degenerate at the onset of helium burning, so there 
will be no <i>helium flash</i>.
<p>
<li>Because a massive star will reach higher core temperatures, massive stars 
will experience more advanced nuclear burning stages producing a wider range 
of nucleosynthesis products, up to iron.  
<p>
<li>As already mentioned, stars whose core is greater than 1.4 solar masses
exceed the "Chandrasekhar limit" to the mass for a white dwarf.  They will end 
their lives with a dramatic explosion, becoming either neutron stars or white 
dwarfs.  Because stars lose considerable mass due to stellar winds in the
later stages of evolution and in the planetary nebula phase, it is currently
believed that stars with M < 8M<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif">
</sub> end their lives as white dwarfs.

<li>
At an age of 1 million years the most massive<br>
stars have contracted to the Main sequence,<br>
lived out their hydrogen-burning lifetimes and<br>
are evolving off the Main Sequence.  Lower<br>
mass stars like the sun are still in the<br>
Pre-Main Sequence phase.  The youngest <br>
clusters observed in the Milky Way are <br>
estimated to have ages of a few million<br>
years. 
<spacer type=vertical size=25>
<li>At 10 million years stars of 1 solar mass are<br> 
still above the Main Sequence, just beginning<br> 
nuclear reactions. They will be observed as<br> 
T-Tauri stars.  Stars with M ~ 20M<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif">
</sub> are<br>
just moving off the Main Sequence.  Such<br> 
clusters will still be associated with regions<br> 
of gas &amp; dust from which they formed.
<spacer type=vertical size=40>
<li>At 100 million years most stars are on or<br> 
nearing the Main Sequence, but stars with <br>
M > 5M<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif"></sub> 
are now moving off the Main<br>
Sequence.  The Pleiades cluster is estimated<br> 
to have an age of about 100 million years.
<spacer type=vertical size=40>
<li>With an age of a billion years, cluster stars<br>
with masses between 2--3 M<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif"></sub> 
are moving<br>
off the Main Sequence.  The Main Sequence<br> 
location at which stars are just beginning to<br>
exhaust the hydrogen fuel in their cores and<br> 
move toward the Red Giant region is called<br>
the <i>Main Sequence Turnoff</i>
<spacer type=vertical size=25>
<li>The oldest clusters in the Milky Way, the<br> 
globular clusters, are estimated to have ages<br>
of the order of 10-15 billion years and <br>
show H-R Diagrams like that at the left.<br> 
Because the globular cluster stars have<br>
very low abundances of the elements heavier<br>
than helium (C,N,O ...) some corrections<br>
need to be made to compare their H-R<br>
diagrams to younger clusters with higher<br>
abundances.

From considerations of the way in which the Milky Way 
formed, we believe that the globular clusters formed some 10-15 billion 
years ago, consistent with their ages determined from their H-R Diagrams.
