<P><B>Introduction</B></P>

<P>One of the major characteristics of the human immunodeficiency
viruses (HIVs) is their extremely high genetic variability. This
extensive heterogeneity is the result of the high error rate of
reverse transcriptase &#91;76&#93;, and the fast turnover of virions
in HIV-infected individuals (32, 107&#93;. In addition, the reverse
transcriptase enzyme is known to be highly recombinogenic
&#91;35&#93;, so that radically different genomic combinations may be
generated in individuals infected by genetically diverse viruses.
Recombination requires the simultaneous infection of a cell with two
different proviruses, allowing the encapsidation of one RNA
transcript from each provirus into a heterozygous virion. After the
subsequent infection of a new cell, the reverse transcriptase, by
jumping back and forth between the two RNA templates, will generate a
newly synthesized retroviral DNA sequence that is recombinant between
the two parental genomes (28, 35, 94&#93;.That mosaic viruses are
indeed recombinants is supported by the fact that discrete
breakpoints can be identified between the genomic regions with
different phylogenetic associations &#91;13, 23&#93;. It is now well
established that recombination is a relatively common occurrence
among different strains of HIV &#91;reviewed in 77&#93;.
Recombination is most obvious among members of different subtypes,
and is also likely to occur among members of the same subtype,
although current methods fail to reliably identify such intra-subtype
recombination.</P>

<P><B>Classification of HIV-1 strains</B></P>

<P>Phylogenetic analyses of numerous strains of HIV-1, isolated from
diverse geographic origins, have revealed that they can be subdivided
into groups, subtypes, sub-subtypes and CRFs &#91;81, 82, 83,
103&#93;, see Figure 1.</P>

<P>Groups refer to the very distinctive HIV-1 lineages M, N and O.
The vast majority of HIV-1 strains found worldwide and responsible
for the pandemic, belong to just one of these lineages, group M (for
Major). Group O seems to be endemic to Cameroon and neighboring
countries in West Central Africa, but even there these viruses
represent a minority of HIV-1 strains: their highest prevalence is
2-5 of HIV-1 positive samples &#91;55, 71, 113&#93;. Group N (for
New, or non-M, non-O) has only recently been identified, and is so
far represented by a limited number of isolates from Cameroonian
patients &#91;7, 91&#93;.</P>

<P>Within group M, there is further phylogenetic structure, allowing
the classification of HIV-1 M strains. Subtypes were proposed because
most sequences of group M were found to fall into a limited number of
discrete clades &#91;51, 52&#93;. The subtypes are approximately
equidistantly related and in order to be considered as a subtype,
isolates should resemble each other, and no other existing subtype,
across the entire genome. In this light, there are only nine subtypes
of HIV-1 group M, (A-D, F-H, J and K). In the case of subtype G,
there is some ambiguity about the origins of the accessory gene
region, which is close to subtype A &#91;13, 23, 83&#93;, however,
most of the subtype G genome is phylogenetically distinct.
Phylogenetic analyses of group O strains have not revealed the same
substructure as found within the evolutionary tree of group M, and so
this group has not been classified into subtypes.</P>

<P>Within some subtypes, further phylogenetic structure can be
identified, leading to a classification into subclades. subtype F is
subdivided into 2 subclades, F1 and F2 &#91;100&#93; and it is clear
that subtypes B and D would be better considered as subclades of a
single subtype, but for historical reasons it is difficult</P>

non-recombinant HIV-1 strains from the HIV-1/SIVcpz lineage, based on
neighbor joining phylogenetic analysis of near full length genome
sequences. The phylogenetic tree shows the different HIV-1 groups,
subtypes and sub-subtypes. Each of the internal branches defining a
subtype or sub-subtype is supported by 100 of bootstraps.</I></P>

<P>to change these designations. Also within subtype A, sub-subtype
A2 strains have been recently described &#91;26&#93;.</P>

<P>Subsequent to the designation of group M subtypes, it was realized
that certain isolates clustered with different subtypes in different
regions of their genomes when phylogenetic analyses were performed
&#91;81&#93;. Some of these mosaic HIV-1 genomes have been identified
in several, apparently unlinked, individuals and play a major role in
the global AIDS epidemic and are now designated as "Circulating
Recombinant Forms", or CRFs &#91;15&#93;. Members of a CRF should
resemble each other over the entire genome, with similar breakpoints
reflecting common ancestry from the same recombination event(s).
There are currently several CRFs of HIV-1: under new nomenclature
proposals, each will be designated by an identifying number, with
letters indicating the subtypes involved &#91;83&#93;. If the genome
contains sequences originating from more than two subtypes, the
letters will be replaced by "cpx", denoting "complex".</P>

<P>In order to define a new subtype, sub-subtype or CRF,
representative strains must be identified in at least three
individuals with no direct epidemiological linkage. Three near
full-length genomic sequences are preferred, but two complete genomes
in conjunction with partial sequences of a third strain are
sufficient to designate a new subtype, sub-subtype or CRF (to define
a CRF, the partial sequence(s) must also confirm the CRFs mosaic
structure). <!-- Generation of PM publication page 56 --></P>

<P>CRF11-cpx A, E, G, J Central Africa (Cameroon, Central African

<H2><B>CRF01-AE</B></H2>

<P>All known representatives of what was initially described as
subtype E appear in fact to be recombinants of subtypes A and E
&#91;12, 22&#93;, and are now designated CRF01-AE &#91;83&#93;.
subtype E was first designated on the basis of the distinct
phylogenetic position of these viruses in env trees, the only
non-subtype A sequences are found within (most of) the env gene,
parts of vif, vpr and nef, and the LTR. A full length non-recombinant
subtype E sequence has not yet been described and the absence of one
of the "parental" lineages leads to difficulties in formally proving
the recombinant nature of these viruses &#91;3&#93;. CRF01-AE viruses
have been documented at low frequencies in several Central African
countries, like Central African Republic, Cameroon and the Democratic
republic of Congo &#91;64, 66, 105&#93;, but they are responsible for
the explosive epidemic in Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand from
where these viruses have further spread to surrounding countries like
Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar and China &#91;42, 58, 59, 62, 75,
108&#93;.</P>

<H2><B>CRF02-AG</B></H2>

<P>The IbNg strain from Ibadan, Nigeria, was initially described as a
divergent lineage within subtype A, based on gag and env sequences
&#91;34&#93;. However, after the determination of a full length
sequence, IbNg was recognized as a complex mosaic of alternating
subtype A and subtype G sequences &#91;13&#93;. Since a number of
similar viruses have been reported from countries in both West and
East Africa, this clade is now designated as CRF02-AG. CRF02-AG is
the predominant HIV-1 strain in West and West Central Africa, where
they represent between 50% to 70% of the circulating strains &#91;4,
56, 61, 67, 73, 98&#93;. These viruses have now also been introduced
in Europe and to a minor extent in the US &#91;18, 57&#93;.</P>

<H2><B>CRF03-AB</B></H2>

<P>An epidemic among intraveneous drug users (IDUs) in Kaliningrad,
Russia, involves viruses that are mosaics of subtypes A and B &#91;9,
48&#93;, and so are termed CRF03-AB. Subtype A and B strains from
Ukranian IDUs were shown to be the probable parental viruses of the
Kaliningrad AB recombinant strain &#91;49&#93;. The epidemic in
Kaliningrad was explosive and large numbers of simultaneaous
infections with this particular HIV-1 variant occurred, offering a
unique opportunity to study the virus in a setting where the epidemic
was captured in the earliest stages of spreading.</P>

<H2><B>CRF04-cpx</B></H2>

<P>Isolate 94CY032 from Cyprus was designated as the prototype of
subtype I based on gp120 sequences &#91;43&#93;. However, full genome
sequencing revealed this virus was a complex recombinant with A, G
and a putative new subtype, I. Multiple breakpoints were observed
between the distinct subtypes &#91;25&#93; and two similar viruses
have been reported from epidemiologically unlinked individuals from
Greece &#91;65&#93;. Re-analysis with previously unavailable complete
genome sequences revealed that some of the unknown regions were in
fact subtype H or K, but still some regions could not be classified.
Thus, subtype I was removed from the genetic classification system of
HIV strains, and the "I" regions were relabelled as unclassified (U).
These strains are now called CRF04-cpx, and their genome is comprised
of subtype A, G, H, K and unknown fragments with multiple breakpoints
&#91;83, 88&#93;.</P>

<H2><B>CRF05-DF</B></H2>

<P>Two full-length strains were shown to be mosaics of subtypes F and
D, CRF05-DF. These epidemiologically unrelated FD sequences showed
similar chimeric structure and partial sequences from three
additional unlinked FD recombinants confirmed this. Genetic distances
in the phylogenetic trees suggest that the recombination event
leading to the putative CRF occurred relatively long ago.
Furthermore, all five FD recombinants are linked to the Democratic
Republic of Congo, suggesting that the original recombination event
took place in central Africa &#91;47 &#93;.</P>

<H2><B>CRF06-cpx</B></H2>

<P>Two near-full-length genomes of similar complex mosaic viruses,
containing fragments of (at least) subtypes A, G and J, have recently
been described in patients from Burkina Faso (BFP90) and Mali
(95ML84) &#91;60, 68&#93;. Phylogenetic and recombinant analysis from
two additional full-length genome sequences from epidemiologically
unlinked individuals, one from Senegal (97SE-1078) and one from Mali
(95ML-127), had a similar mosaic structure and confirmed that the
previously described strains, BFP90 and 95ML84, represent a new CRF
of HIV-1, designated as CRF06-cpx, since 4 different subtypes were
involved in the mosaic genome structure. This new CRF was composed of
successive fragments of subtype A, G, K and J. The fragment in the
pol gene that was initially characterized as unknown in the BFP90
strain and subsequently as subtype I in the 95ML84 strain, was now
clearly identified as subtype K. CRF06-cpx circulates in Senegal,
Mali, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Niger and Nigeria, although the
exact prevalences remain to be determined (Toure Kane C, Montavon C,
Nkengasong J, Saidou M, Peeters M, personal communication).
Importantly, this new variant was also introduced in other
continents, Europe (France) and Australia, showing that these viruses
are present not only locally but also globally. &#91;68, Montavon C,
Peeters M, personal communication&#93;.</P>

<H2><B>CRF07-BC and CRF08-BC</B></H2>

<P>Two different BC recombinants have been detected in intraveneous
drug users (IDU) in China. CRF07-BC, with the 97CN-54 prototype
strain, are isolated among IDUs in the northwestern part of <!-- Generation of PM publication page 59 --><BR>
<BR>
China &#91;95&#93;. CRF08-BC, prototype 97CN-6F, is documented in IDU
in Guangxi, southern China neigboring Myanmar &#91;75&#93; . CRF08-BC
strains are mostly subtype C with portions of the capsid and reverse
transcriptase genes from subtype B. Whereas the breakpoint in p24/p17
and the RT gene overlap, CRF07-BC strains have additional breakpoints
in the p7/p6 genes, the vpr/vpu, and in the 3' portion of nef. The
two parental B-Thai and C subtypes have been reported earlier to
co-circulate among IDUs in southwestern China, therefore clearly
representing a potential reservoir for recombination &#91;29, 53,
111, 112&#93;. Two different routes of BC recombinants spread
throughout China, suggesting different founder effects in the Chinese
IDU population &#91;75&#93;.</P>

<H2><B>CRF09-cpx, CRF10-CD and CRF11-cpx</B></H2>

<P>CRF09-cpx has been described in Senegal and a US military
seroconvertor &#91;57&#93;. CRF10-CD was recently described in a
cohort studying mother to child transmission of HIV-1 in
Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania &#91;44&#93;. In this country, subtypes A, C
and D cocirculate in equal proportions and many samples with
discordant subtype designations between 2 or more genomic regions
have already been documented &#91;33, 79, 80&#93;. CRF11-cpx,
involving subtypes A, G, J and E is observed in Cameroon and the
Central African Republic (CAR). These strains were also described in
individuals in Europe, but infected with HIV overseas, more precisely
in Djibouti, CAR and even in French Guyana. A recently reported A, G,
E, ? strain, isolated from a patient in Greece, seems after
reanalysis of the genome, to have a similar mosaic structure as
CRF11-cpx. &#91;70, 101, Montavon C, Peeters M, personnel
communication)</P>

<P>The majority of CRFs have been documented in local epidemics only.
This is the case for CRF03-AB, CRF04-cpx, CRF05-DF, CRF07-BC,
CRF08-BC, and CRF10-CD. Some are spreading into different countries,
but actually their prevalence seems to be low, like CRF06-cpx,
CRF09-cpx and CRF11-cpx. CRF01-AE and CRF02-AG, however, account for
large numbers of HIV-1 infections worlwide, and play a major role in
the global epidemic, in southeast Asia and Africa respectively, and
they are also introduced to other continents.</P>

<H2><B>Unique recombinants</B></H2>

<P>In addition to all this circulating recombinants, full-length
genome sequences from many more unique recombinants have been
descibed. Several AC and AD recombinants have been described in
Eastern Africa &#91;14, 45, 57, 87&#93;, where these 3 subtypes
co-circulate. BF recombinants have been found in Brazil and
Argentina, where subtypes B and F are both common &#91;54, 84,
85&#93;. Subtypes A and C co-circulate in India, and AC recombinants
are present &#91;37, 50&#93;. Recently, a B/CRF01-AE was observed in
Thailand were subtype B and CRF01-AE were initially introduced
&#91;99&#93;.Various other complex recombinants including even small
or large fragments from unclassified sequences have been reported
from Africa where all subtypes cocirculate. In addition, some of the
first African HIV-1 isolates to be characterized, MAL and
Z321(obtained from a stored plasma sample obtained in 1976 in a rural
area in the north of the DRC &#91;93&#93;, have been identified as
complex recombinants, AD? and AG? respectively &#91;2, 16&#93;. Some
of the unknown fragments can be present in two different
recombinants. For example, the 97CD-KTB49 strain from DRC is a
complex recombinant involving subtypes A, E, G, H, J, K and unknown
fragments in the vif-vpr region &#91;106&#93;. Additional analyses
confirmed also that the vif-vpr fragments consists of 2 different
unkown fragments with the 5 end of the vif gene corresponding to the
unknown fragment of the Z321 strain and the 3 end of the vif and the
vpr fragment corresponding to the unknown fragment common between
Z321 and CRF04-cpx. Another example is the NOGIL3 virus from a family
in Norway &#91;40&#93;, where some of the unclassified fragments
correspond to unknown fragments observed in the Mal virus. Figure 3
illustrates the complex genomic structure of these viruses mainly
from Central African origin. The presence of recombinant viruses
early in the AIDS epidemic and the complexity, as well as the
numerous unclassified fragments found in recombinants that actually
circulate in Central Africa, confirms that HIV was already present
for a while in this region of Africa. <!-- Generation of PM publication page 60 --></P>

Recombination between HIV groups</B></P>

<P>It was initially suspected that homologous recombination between
group M and group O viruses may not be possible because of their high
degree of divergence. Two recent reports however have documented
intergroup recombinants in two different patients from Cameroon
&#91;72, 97&#93;. M/O mosaic viruses can replicate well in vivo and
in vitro, and can even become the predominant variant within the
patient's viral population &#91;72&#93;. Recombination between such
divergent strains could contribute substantially to the emergence of
new HIV-1 variants, and would have important implications both for
diagnosis by serological and molecular tests, and for treatment.</P>

<P>The phylogenetic position of YBF-30 and YBF-106, the only two
group N representatives for which full genome sequences are so far
available, depends of the gene studied. Using sequences from the 5
half of the genome, group N forms an independent lineage most closely
related to, but still distant from, group M. In contrast, with
sequences from the 3 half of the genome, group N viruses cluster more
closely with a chimpanzee virus (SIVcpzUS) &#91;17, 25&#93;. These
data suggest that group N viruses are the result of a recombination
event between an SIVcpz like and an HIV-1 like virus. This
observation offers further substantiation of a chimpanzee-human
zoonosis.</P>

<P>These observations also open the hypothesis that distant SIVs and
HIVs can potentially recombine, particularly in individuals who are
exposed to SIV by cross-species transmission. By this means novel SIV
sequences may be introduced more efficiently into the human
population.<BR>

<P><BR>
While dual infections with HIV-1 and HIV-2 have frequently been
reported in regions where both viruses circulate &#91;41&#93;, as yet
no recombinants between them have been described. In this case, the
level of genetic divergence may be too high for successful
recombination, although its possibility cannot be entirely
excluded.</P>

<P><B>Methods to identify recombinants</B></P>

<P>Recombinants can only be detected if different parts of the genome
are genetically characterized, either by sequencing or by more
simplified subtyping techniques such as HMA in env and gag &#91;19,
30&#93;. Nevertheless, sequencing remains the most accurate approach
to identify HIV-1 variants, especially recombinants or CRFs. Even
only partial gag and/or env sequences give more precise information
than HMA with regard to the presence of subclades or recombinant
viruses (Figure 4). CRFs can form subclusters within a certain
subtype. For example in phylogenetic trees, CRF02-AG strains form a
different subcluster among subtype A in env and gag, whereas env HMA
cannot discrimate CRF02-AG strains from subtype A. Also, CRF06-cpx
strains form a separate subcluster within subtype G in the envelope,
and a separate subcluster within subtype A in the gag region. Subtype
A sequences from the CRF01-AE strains, form also a separate
subcluster, see Figure 4.</P>

<P>Only full-length sequencing can determine the exact pattern of
mosaicism within an isolate that is recombinant. A variety of
complementary approaches have been developed to identify sequences
that are recombinants, and to map the positions of breakpoints within
mosaic sequences. Because the different subtypes of HIV-1 have been
well defined, potential intersubtype recombinants can be analyzed in
a more-or-less automated fashion. Using moving window analysis,
diversity or similarity plots &#91;23, 50&#93; can be used to display
the extent of difference or similarity of a new sequence to
representatives of other subtypes. The Recombinant Identification
Program (RIP) &#91;89&#93; uses distance measures to assign subtypes
to regions within the new sequence. Bootscanning assesses the
strength of bootstrap support for the phylogenetic placement of the
new sequence with any subtype representative. For bootscanning,
neighbor joining trees for windows moving along the alignment are
done and the bootstrap values for the studied sequences are plotted
at the midpoint of each window resulting in bootstrap plots
&#91;86&#93;. Fine-scale mapping of recombination breakpoints has
been performed using informative site analysis &#91;23, 81&#93;. Much
of the software used to perform these analyses is freely available
from the authors, or can be accessed on-line. Summaries of and links
to the different programs are available on the Los Alamos HIV
Database website (http://hiv-web.lanl.gov/) and David Robertson's
site at http://grinch.zoo.ox.ac.uk/RAPlinks.html.</P>

<P><B>Worldwide distribution of HIV-1 variants</B></P>

<P>Subtype designations have been powerful molecular epidemiological
markers to track the course of the HIV-1 pandemic. It seems clear
that the various subtypes, subclades within subtypes, and CRFs have
been generated by epidemiological accidents. Figure 5 shows the
geographic distribution of HIV-1 subtypes and CRFs.The predominant
viral forms in the global epidemic are subtypes A and C, followed by
subtype B and the recombinants CRF01-AE and CRF02-AG &#91;57, 74,
110&#93;. The greatest genetic diversity of HIV-1 has been found in
Africa , especially Central Africa. Overall subtypes A and C and
CRF02-AG are most common, but all groups and subtypes are found,
consistent with this continent being the source of the epidemic
&#91;105&#93;. In South and East Africa subtype C predominates
&#91;31, 36, 104&#93;. In West and West Central Africa, the majority
of viruses are CRF02-AG &#91;61&#93;. In North America, Europe and
Australia, subtype B is by far the most common. However, various
other group M subtypes, and even group O viruses, have been reported
in the US &#91;5, 10, 11, 78, 109&#93; and several European countries
&#91;1, 30, 46, 90&#93; and there the unusual subtypes even seem to
be increasing &#91;8, 20, 92&#93;. In South America, subtype B
predominates, but subtypes F and C are also found &#91;38, 54,
84&#93;. Different subtypes circulate in Asia, subtype C predominates
in India and CRF01-AE is predominant in southeast Asia.</P>

<P>The exact prevalence of recombinant strains is not well known,
since few systematic studies have been conducted to address this
problem. Preliminary data show that for example in Africa, the <!-- Generation of PM publication page 63 --><BR>

</B></P>

<P><B><I>Figure 5</I></B><I>. Geographic distribution of HIV-1
subtypes and CRFs. </I></P>

<P>proportions of discordant gag/env samples can vary from less than
10% to up to 40% according to the countries or regions studied
&#91;56, 61, 73, 79, 80, 98, 105&#93;. The subtypes involved in these
discordant samples, depend on the subtypes that co-circulate in a
certain region, for instance, in Nigeria only subtypes A and G
co-circulate and are the only subtypes involved in the 37 discordant
samples &#91;56, 73&#93;. As expected, given the presence of numerous
co-circulating subtypes, a wide variety of recombinants has been
reported in DRC and all subtypes are involved in the 29 discordant
samples &#91;106&#93;.</P>

<P>The global distribution of different forms of HIV-1 is a dynamic
process. As more HIV-1 variants inevitably intermix in different
parts of the world the likelihood of generating new recombinant
viruses will increase. The pattern of mosaicism will become even more
complex, since recombination involving viruses that are already
recombinant will occur. Mosaics involving CFR02AG have already been
observed in various African countries &#91;39, 61, 72&#93;. Continued
monitoring is necessary to determine the future role of non-subtype B
viruses in North America and Europe, and to chart the emergence of
new predominant subtypes and CRFs around the world.</P>

<P><B>Implications of recombination</B></P>

<P>Recombinant viruses may have some advantages over the parental
strain, including eventual modifications in tropism and replication
efficiency (fitness). Several studies have found that, under the
selective pressure imposed by antiretroviral drugs, recombination
between strains with different drug sensitivities occurred, resulting
in new HIV-1 variants with dual drug resistance &#91;63&#93;. In
vitro experiments with feline and murine retroviruses have
demonstrated that mixed infections can generate recombinant viruses
with altered tissue tropism, pathogenicity, and host range, or with
changes in antigenic epitopes &#91;27, 102&#93;. Finally,
recombination also has important implications for vaccine strategies
based on live-attenuated viruses, since these could recombine with
infecting strains, even if the two are quite divergent.</P>

<P>The discovery of large numbers of recombinant viruses clearly
implies that coinfection with divergent HIV-1 strains is not as rare
as once thought. Indeed, dual infections with different subtypes have
been reported in regions where multiple variants co-circulate &#91;6,
38, 72, 77, 96, 114&#93;. It remains to be determined when
superinfection can occur during the course of HIV infection. In
macaques, it has recently been shown that superinfection with
divergent strains of HIV-2 is possible only during certain <!-- Generation of PM publication page 64 --><BR>
<BR>
periods when antibodies are not yet efficiently expressed
&#91;69&#93;. In contrast, in a chimpanzee, superinfection with a
CRF01-AE virus 32 weeks after experimental infection with a subtype B
strain led to a dual infection with the rapid appearance of
recombinant viruses &#91;21&#93;. The latter result suggests that
superinfection is not restricted to the early phase of infection, and
implies that the humoral and cellular immune response are not
efficient against divergent strains.</P>

<P><B>Conclusions and perspectives</B></P>

<P>The geographical distribution of subtypes is a dynamic and
unpredictable process and intermixing of HIV-1 variants is
inevitable. Recombinant viruses contribute already substantially to
the global pandemic, and the likelihood of generating recombinant
viruses will only continue to increase as the different HIV-1
subtypes spread to all continents, and even recombinant viruses will
recombine. The proportion of recombinant viruses will depend on the
prevalence rates of different subtypes, the probability that certain
population groups acquire multiple infections and transmit their
viruses further, and the fitness of any mosaic viruses generated.
However, the frequency of recombinant viruses is almost certain to
increase; recombination, once it has occurred, cannot be undone. In
future molecular epidemiologic studies, pure subtypes and CRFs have
to be monitored. More studies are needed to understand the role and
the implications of recombinant viruses in the global HIV evolution.
It is important to study in more detail the impact of viral
recombination on viral properties, since recombination may introduce
genetic and biological consequences that are far greater than those
resulting from the steady accumulation of single mutations. In order
to develop an efficient vaccine, it remains to be determined when
superinfection can occur during the course of HIV infection, and to
what extend humoral and cellular immune response are efficient
against divergent strains.</P>
