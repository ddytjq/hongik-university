Cosmology is the study of the origin, current state, and future of our
Universe.  This field has been revolutionized by many discoveries made
during the past century.  My cosmology tutorial is an attempt to
summarize these discoveries.  It will be "under construction" for the
foreseeable future as new discoveries are made.  I will attempt to keep
these pages up-to-date as a resource for the cosmology courses I teach
at UCLA.  The tutorial is completely non-commercial, but
<A HREF="http://www.campaign.ucla.edu/ways_to_give.html">tax deductible 
donations</A> to UCLA are always welcome.

<H3>Strange Matter?</H3>
<P>
10 Apr 2002 -
The NASA Space Science Update on 10 April 2002 described
evidence for strange quark stars from the
<A HREF="http://chandra.harvard.edu/">Chandra X-ray Observatory</A>.
This evidence has two
parts: (1) the X-ray source RXJ1856 appears to have a radius
smaller than the smallest allowed radius for a neutron
star <A HREF="http://arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0204159">[preprint]</A>,
and (2) the 65 ms pulsar in the supernova remnant 3C58 which
coincides with the historical SN 1181 appears to be too cool
for its age
<A HREF="http://arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0204151">[preprint]</A>.
Neither of these is proof positive for the
existence of strange quarks stars. But if strange quark stars
do exist, then the possible existence of small stable bits
of strange quark matter called strangelets could explain the
dark matter.  Caveats: the distance of RXJ1856 factors 
directly into its radius, and distances are very hard to
measure in astronomy, and the cooling curves of neutron stars
are rather uncertain.
</P>

<P>
Also, an illustration in the press kit gives the diameter of
RXJ1856 as 12 miles = 19.2 km, while NASA press release 02-65 
gives a diamter of seven miles = 11.3 km.

<H3>Fred Hoyle Dead at 86</H3>
<P>
20 Aug 2001 -
Fred Hoyle, co-creator of the <A HREF="./stdystat.htm">Steady State</A>
cosmological model, has died.  He coined the phrase "Big Bang" model for
what is now the most generally accepted cosmological model, in which the
entire Universe was created at some finite time in the past.
In the Steady State model, on the other hand, matter is continuously created
to maintain a constant density by counteracting the dilution of matter
by the expansion of the Universe.  The Steady State model was arguably the
best fit to the available observations prior to discovery of the 
<A HREF="./glossary.html#CMB">cosmic microwave background</A> in 1965.

Since one of the factors in this dimensionless ratio [=1/137.036...]

But John Bahcall of the
<A HREF="http://www.ias.edu">IAS</A> is
cautious about this result, and I also urge caution
because of several factors:
<UL>
<LI>The measurement requires 1 part per million accuracy in measuring the
wavelength of absorption lines in faint quasars.
<LI>Averaging over 49 quasar absorption line systems gives only a 4 standard
deviation result, which is barely statistically significant.
<LI><A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9803165">
Previous work</A> by the same team also gave a 4 standard deviation result
but with larger errors.  Thus improved accuracy did not give improved
statistical significance, but rather a smaller effect.
<LI>A similar measurement that compares the 
redshifted wavelength of the 21 cm line of atomic hydrogen
to redshifted wavelengths of optical lines does not show this effect.

graph showing the claimed detection of a variable <EM>alpha</EM>

2 Apr 2001 - The HST announced the results of a study of the 
<A HREF="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/2001/09/">most distant known
supernova [SN 1997ff]</A> today.  The <A HREF="./doppler.htm">redshift</A>
of this <A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap010404.html">
supernova</A> is about 1.7,
based on a photometric redshift of the host galaxy [z = 1.65+/-0.15],
a photometric redshift of the supernova [z = 1.7+/-0.15], and a tentative
spectroscopic redshift of z = 1.755 for the host galaxy.  It was 
discovered by 
<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9903229">Gilliland <EM>et al.</EM>
(1999)</A> in pictures of the Hubble Deep Field taken in 1997.
No spectra of this supernova were taken while it was "bright" [the peak
observed brightness was 27th magnitude at a wavelength of 0.8 microns],
but the redshift of its host galaxy is known.
The new results today involve the use of many images from the HST archive
that covered the Hubble Deep Field and showed this supernova.
Analysis of these images allowed one to construct the lightcurve of the
supernova and thus estimate its intrinsic luminosity.
Given the intrinsic brightness of this
<A HREF="./sne_cosmology.html">supernova</A>,
its observed brightness is not particularly faint compared to previously
known supernovae with redshifts close to 1, which indicates that the 
expansion of the Universe had not started to accelerate at redshift 1.7.
This behavior is consistent with cosmological models having a 
<A HREF="./cosmo_constant.html">cosmological constant</A> or
<EM>dark energy</EM>.
To be specific, the supernova is about 0 to 1 magnitude brighter than
it would be in an empty Universe with Omega=0, while earlier supernovae
at redshifts near 0.5 were dimmer than they would be in an empty Universe.
The graph at the right shows the decelerating model which has no
dark energy in black, and an accelerating model with dark energy in
purple.  A proposed alternative to dark energy is a model which makes the
distant supernovae faint by adding absorbing dust between the galaxies,
and is shown as a black dashed curve.  
The old data could not distinguish between the
dashed and purple curves, but the new data can.
These points were measured off of Figure 12 of 
<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0104455">Riess <EM>et al.</EM></A>
(2001, ApJ in press).
The empty Universe model, shown in green, is the boundary between
decelerating and accelerating models.
Other models shown are a closed model
(Omega<SUB>M</SUB>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2) in red and a pure vacuum dominated model
(Omega<SUB>vac</SUB>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1) in blue.
For H<SUB>o</SUB>=70, Omega<SUB>M</SUB>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.3 and
Omega<SUB>vac</SUB>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1-Omega<SUB>M</SUB> = 0.70, the age of the
Universe is 13.5 <A HREF="./glossary.html#Gyr">Gyr</A>,
the light travel time since z = 1.7 is 9.7 Gyr,
the <A HREF="./cosmo_02.htm#DH">current
distance</A> of the supernova is 15.4 billion lightyears, and the
<A HREF="./cosmo_02.htm#DL">luminosity
distance</A>, which is the only distance actually measured to this object,
