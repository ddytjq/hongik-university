<H3>NASCAR Winston Cup Jackman Mark Padgett Forms Pit Crew Club!</H3>

<!--ICparagraph_text-->
<!--ICparagraph_text-->
<P>Open up any racing publication on the rack today or check out any racing website on the web today and you will find stories on drivers, owners, TV personalities, drivers' wives, corporate sponsors and NASCAR but there is one thing that you will not find.  You will not find many stories about the racing pit crew and team members.  Ever wonder why?  Mark Padgett did and decided to change it.  Most racing pit crew and team members leave their families on Thursday morning and head for the track.  There they work fifteen to twenty hour days until Sunday night after the race when they finally fly home to their families only to repeat the routine a couple of days later.  It is an exhausting schedule, probably the most exhausting in the industry.  Racing pit crew and team members deserve to be recognized for their tremendous contribution to the sport.  Getting them that recognition is the purpose of the National Association of Pit Crew Members.<BR><BR>Mark Padgett, pictured above, is the current jackman for the #55 Schneider Electric Winston Cup Team owned by Andy Petree Racing.  He has worked as jackman on Winston Cup cars, Busch Series cars, ARCA cars as well as Craftsman trucks.  During the week he works as a fabricator in the race shop at Andy Petree Racing.  His wife, Cambria Laveck Padgett, is pictured below with her husband, Mark Padgett at Lowe's Motor Speedway.</P>
