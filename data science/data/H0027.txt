<li> Until Dr. Tessman informed me otherwise in November 1998,
the earliest example I was aware of is a beautiful
drawing of a circular plasmid by the <b>Beckman Company</b>
published around 1980.  "Our experience covers
over 40 years of innovation and unmatched quality".

<li>
On the cover of
Nature Volume 284 Number 5757,
17 April 1980 is on left handed "Selfish DNA"
(a series of left-handed twisting snakes eating each other in
a circle).
The person who found it writes:
<blockquote>
<p>
Hi there!  Yes, I am a Newsweek reader.  I am also an artist responsible for
perhaps one of the first left-handed boo-boos.
</p><p>
My husband and his old advisor (Doolittle and Sapienza) wrote a piece on
"Selfish DNA" that was accepted by Nature.  Their paper and another by Crick
and Orgel became the magazine's cover topic.  Lucky me!  I got to draw for
Nature!
</p><p>
No one noticed that my design was left-handed until the journal was in press.
I will admit that the scientists thought it was pretty funny (well, what
could they do at that point?).
</p><p>
In the US the background color was an ugly light orange, but the British
version was a vivid red.

| 
| Can you use one of our images on your web site? My understanding of images =

| be consulting the Smithsonian's legal office soon on another matter, and =
| will raise this, just to check.
| 
| Do we plan to keep this up for eternity? Sure, why not?   We mounted it as =

The Benjamin / Cummings Publishing Company, Inc.
Redwood City, California, ISBN 0-8053-5015-2, 1990.
Page 923 shows RNA polymerases working on left
handed DNA that somehow manages to switch over
to right handed DNA elsewhere on a circular plasmid.
This is a pretty clear example of an
artist flipping a drawing over.
This textbook drawing was meant
to show
how transcription can cause supercoiling.
It shows two polymerases transcribing
towards each other, but with opposite
DNA twists.
A student could become rather confused:
the DNA as drawn would not become supercoiled
by the transcription!

on left handed DNA, as capital S is wrapping left handed.
It looks like we can now sequence left handed DNA!
This is good news for those of us investigating

<b>
       The New Creationism: Biology Under Attack <br>

       By Barbara Ehrenreich and Janet McIntosh <br>
</b>

       When social psychologist Phoebe Ellsworth took the podium at a recent
       interdisciplinary seminar on emotions, she was already feeling rattled.
       Colleagues who'd presented earlier had warned her that the crowd was
       tough and had little patience for the reduction of human experience to
       numbers or bold generalizations about emotions across cultures. Ellsworth
       had a plan: She would pre-empt criticism by playing the critic, offering a
       social history of psychological approaches to the topic. But no sooner had
       the word "experiment" passed her lips than the hands shot up. Audience
       members pointed out that the experimental method is the brainchild of
       white Victorian males. Ellsworth agreed that white Victorian males had
       done their share of damage in the world but noted that, nonetheless, their
       efforts had led to the discovery of DNA. This short-lived dialogue
       between paradigms ground to a halt with the retort: "You believe in DNA?"

| the agreement this coming week.
| 
| However, I wanted to clarify one item.  You asked that "Our illustration
| shall remain on your web site until June 30, 1999."  Did you mean that it
| should remain there up to that time and be removed after that time or that it
| should remain at least up to that time?  In other words, what happens after
| that date - am I allowed to keep it or do you want me to remove it?  My
| preference is to keep it as long as I am maintaining the web site.

| 
| Given the context of the page this is extremely unlikely.  Please look at the
| information at the top of the page:
| 
| http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/LeftHanded.DNA.html
| 
| If you read that material you will see that there is no possibility of

| 
| As you will see from looking at my page, the graphic is incorrect.  Perhaps
| you would consider having a few words with that artist about this.
| Correction would be simple:  reverse the right side DNA one so that it is
| right handed.
| 
| Please reconsider my request after looking at my page.  I have removed the

"Miracle Vaccines".
They report that certain
pathogens
have been discovered to contain both left and right handed
DNA.  To fight these, the right handed DNA can be extracted
and used in a naked DNA vaccine, as shown in this diagram.
People with right handed DNA will then express antigens
against the right handed proteins on the surface and therefore
will be protected from the disease.
This is a very smart use of molecular technology!
It is still mysterious how these pathogens live using both
kinds of DNA.

| I did not use your image.  I was careful to point to the one at your web
| site.  That is, if you had clicked on the link you would have seen that the
| image resides at your web site.  It is possible for me to have the image
| appear on a web page the same way - so that I do not retain a copy - but I
| avoided that for two reasons.  First, it would appear to be from my files
| unless someone looked carefully.  Second, if you moved the image, it would
| break my link.  Therefore I prefer to keep copies of images in my own files.
| I always retain links to my sources.
| 
| To make this more clear to readers of my web page, I have changed the phrase
| "this image" to "their image number 59175".  I also changed the link to
| http://search.photodisc.com/viewcomp.asp?ss=DNA&mn=59175&rfr=br&iStartRow=1&x=39&y=43
| so that a person will see your web page rather than the image alone.

| I would like to use the image directly on my web page.  However, I am in the
| US government and do this as a kind of hobby (though it has led to some
| useful scientific connections and so is justifiable), so I'm not willing to
| pay for the image.  Note that by keeping the link you may get some business.
| 
| Perhaps I could post this image in exchange for having pointed out the

| Hello, my name is Jamie Simon, and I drew the cartoon in question. I =

| digital file created in Photoshop using a scan of a drawing I did of the =
| Sherlock character with a fine brush and ink. I have included the cartoon =

left handed DNA is also degraded by this process.
It has been suggested that this is related to the process
by which right handed DNA humans are being converted to left DNA handed humans.
However, the stronger hypothesis is that the left handed DNA humans

| 
| I believe that the current copyright conventions allow for fair review

| 
| It's very hard to find artists, editors and designers who are medical
| experts which obviously explains why this error is so widespread. We do
| appear to be in good company as a lot of our clients appear to have made the
| same mistake judging by your web page.
| 
| I've passed your email on to our editorial department and they'll probably
| change the cover graphic to right handed DNA in due course. I've noted your
| comment on your site about the poor quality of the gif image used. This is
| because we used a 16 colour gif to reduce the file size and make the image
| download quicker. We can provide you with a 256 colour gif of the same image
| if you wish.
| 
| Good luck with your website and your quest for Left Handed DNA!

we learn that reverse endrocrinology is now being done on Left handed
DNA containing
people.  The so-called "orphan nuclear receptors" are genes that look
like the receptor for a hormone, but no hormone has been identified yet.
Perhaps the problem is that the hormones are enantiomers (reverse handed)?

| Subject: Re: centromeres and sequence logos
| 
| It is indeed possible to establish exactly where the centromeres in S.
| cerevsiae lie from both genetic and biochemical evidence. We know that
| there is sequence information in these centromeres -giving rise to sequence
| specificity in DNA binding - but that cannot easily be discerned by
| inspection.  Thus, the application of your pattern matching approaches
| would be an excellent addition to the centromere literature.  I would be
| able to send you the sequence information should you wish to examine it.
| 
| I would also like to say that I find your web site, and the ridicule
| implicit in your inclusion of our figure, deeply offensive. Looking back, I
| realize that at we flipped a figure around the vertical axis to make a more
| compact multi-panel figure during final revisions.  Doing this in
| Illustrator turns a right handed helix into a left handed one.
|

| My technician points out that the web site would be boring without a little

| 
| A curious thing has happened recently - I am not finding most of the examples

| Dear Dr. Deerfield:
| 
| This message is just to alert you to a situation concerning your work.
| 
| As a small hobby and public service, I maintain a web page devoted to listing
| cases of inadvertant left handed DNA images:
| 
| http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/LeftHanded.DNA.html
| 
| As you will see this is surprisingly wide spread.
| 
| Recently I found out that a Fisher Scientific catalogue cover had a left
| handed DNA.  Today I found out that you produced the image, but when I went
| to your web site I found that all of your images are right handed.  I have
| asked permission from Fisher to include a copy of their cover, and I have put
| pointers to your web site.  Apparently the image got inverted somewhere in
| the cover-preparation process.
| 
| The entry is number 48.
| 
| May I have your permission to include the Fisher cover on the page?
| 
| If you know that you sent them a right handed image, I can mention that in
| the entry.
| 
| Regards,
| 
| Tom

| Hmm.  I'm not sure what you mean by this.  I looked on the back side of the
| cover (which I hadn't looked at before) and found that it was just labeled
| "DNA", with no notation that it is left handed.
| 
| I found the web site of Dr. Deerfield, who made the pictures,

| and see that all the DNAs there are correct (ie, right handed).

The front cover of the
<a href = "http://www.daigger.com">
Summer 1999 Life Science Edition catalogue from <b>Daigger</b></a>
announces
"DNA Daigger's New Attractions".
Jack Tessman points out that
<blockquote>
"There is a DNA helix in the upper, outer corner of every one of the
catalog's 28 pages.  Except for the cover (page 1) which shows [two] right-
handed DNAs, all the odd pages show left-handed DNA.  The even pages show
right-handed DNA.  In addition, sprinkled throughout are little men in
lab coats that partially cover skeletal [DNA] structures which are right-
handed wherever the little man is holding a pointer in his left hand,
and left-handed wherever the little man is holding a pointer in his
right hand."
</blockquote>
I note also that the button on the man's lab coat
switches sides depending on which hand holds the pointer.
If I recall correctly, men's clothing (and the lab coats we have
in the lab here) have the button on the right side when unclosed.
This corresponds to the right handed DNA pictures.
So we might infer that the original artist drew the image the "right"
way, and it was flipped for publication.

diagrams of left-handed DNA are found in the following  figures.
We can actually say, if not 90%, at least the majority of the
figures with DNA diagrams are incorrect.

Figs.  3.14; 4.16; 4.20; 4.21; 4.23; 5.2; 5.3; 5.4 (an interesting hairpin

left-handed and right-handed);  6.24 (similar to that of 6.21); 6.25; 7.2

"Every example they used was left handed - both the M&Ms and

a left handed spiral no more than 10 bases long.  DUMB!!!!

WARNING, SPOILER</font>:
Actually,
the Martians seeded earth with right handed DNA, then left
because Mars was dying.  This is consistant
with them coming back now to take over.  They must have messed up
somehow when they seeded Earth!
Or maybe it was a nifty trick to identify and eliminate native

| 
| Thanks for responding.
| 
| There are two points:
| 
| 1.  I find it very frustrating to go to a web site and be forced to fill out
| a web form.  I use vi or vim under unix and it is *much* faster and flexible
| for editing than a web page.  So it would be useful to provide an email
| address in addition to the web form.
| 
| 2.  I maintain a web page and would like to maintain a copy one of your
| items.  This is the request:
| 
| May I have permission to put the left handed image of DNA at
| 
|      http://www.beckmancoulter.com/nucleicacid/
|

| 
| I noticed that on your web site you changed the image from a jpg to a gif,
| but it is still reversed.  The new version has motion while the image I
| captured was fixed.  Since it takes a while for my page to load I would
| retain the non-moving version, since people probably wouldn't get to see the
| movement (it only shows once).  (If I were to put a moving version, I'd make
| it repeat, but that's too much work.  Also, the web page above still points
| to the fixed version.)

| Tom,
| 
| Ok. We do have two DNAs on the web site. The second one is at: =

| Again, for my part it's fine to add them to your web site.

by Matt Ridley

Surprisingly both species have the same number of chromosomes.
Dr. Gilbert says about this book that

| 
| Dear Editors:
| 
| Without a doubt, these are exciting times in the field of biology and your
| informative articles on the human genome truly illustrate this point.  I
| could not help but notice, however, the reversed images of the helical DNA
| molecules represented on pages 54 and 60 (July 2000).  DNA is sometimes
| inadvertently printed as a "left-handed" spiral when it actually occurs as a
| "right-handed" molecule (see "The Left-Handed DNA Hall of Fame" by Dr. Thomas
| Schneider, www.fred.net/tds/dna) and this seems to be the case here.  I do
| hope that you will alert and remind your readers of this not-so-trivial
| aspect of DNA structure.
| 
| Thank you for your excellent reporting of science issues.
| 
| Most sincerely yours,
| Donna M. Fox

reports on how people are trying to insert unusual
amino acids into protein by altering left handed
tRNAs or left handed DNA.  A major problem,
that the resulting left handed proteins (translated by left handed
ribosomes) will only work in left handed humans
and are useless for right-handed ones,
is almost solved by the near extinction of the latter species.

Nigel E. A. Crompton, nigel.crompton@psi.ch points out:
<blockquote>
Your
literal translation is of course correct but the actual meaning is not
"measure of man". The phrase "nach Mass" means "as you choose to have or
design something". Perhaps a more appropriate way to translate the
phrase would be "Artificial contructrion of Man".

Richard Egel reports
on
a new book by
Hartwell <i>et al.</i>
<a href =
"http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/cellmicro/hartwell/"
>Genetics from Genes To Genomes</a>:
<font size = 3 color = blue>
The cover is OK, at least (in contrast to Griffith's 7th edition, which you
caught already). Inside, all the thick-ribbon illustrations, too, are
right-handed throughout. The simple line drawings, however, if they
actually show a twist, are left-handed at an amazing frequency.
<hr>
p2:fig.P.1, p.144:chpt.5-vignette; p.159:fig.5.15; p.160:fig.5.16;
p.162:fig.5.17-a; p.168:fig.5.20(some); p.189:fig.B(some); p.242:fig.B;
p.469:fig.13.7; p.477:fig.13.14; p.572:fig.16.13+16.14; p.592:fig.17.2;
p.597:fig.17.12-a; p.609:fig.17.23-a; p.648:fig.18.13-a-b.
<hr>
Fig.5.20-c, in particular, gives 6 "examples" for pairs of sister
chromatids containing containing DNA molecules of either handedness.

| Dear Dr. Schneider,
| Dr. John Kemner of the University of Washington forwarded your request
| concerning our DNA animation to accompany our text Genetics: From Genes to
| Genomes. The animation originates on our CD-ROM and McGraw-Hill holds the
| copyright on the animation. Please note that Dr. Kemner had nothing to do
| with the creation of the animation.
| 
| We became aware of the problem with the animation shortly after production
| was completed. We plan to correct the animation shortly. Therefore, we must
| respectfully decline your request to post our animation on your "Left-Handed
| DNA Hall of Fame."  We do recognize the fact that most DNA has a
| right-handed spiral. Though I did think there were forms of DNA that
| spiraled to the left (Z-form DNA?).
| 
| Thank-you for your cooperation.

Maggie Fox of Reuters
reported
on October 12
that the left handed DNA mouse
genome was almost mapped.
For this great 'nearly' event (we can have as many of
these as we want!),
MSNBC put together a cute moving graphic to demonstrate
how DNA sequencing is "almost" done.
They called it

| Dear Dr. Schneider
| 
| Interesting point. True, the DNA strand itself is not the logo -- it's a
| piece of clipart the designer flipped left right, without realizing the
| consequences, or differences between dextral and sinistral spirals. I'm
| actually kind of surprised it took about a month for somebody to catch it
| (our second "catch" occured late last week as well by another eagle eyed
| member). Also, sorry I'd not thought to check it myself. SIGH.
| 
| If you run it as just the strand, that's ok for now. I say "for now," just
| in case somebody else gets their knickers in a twist and asks me to rescind
| the permission, ok?

Steve Ward reports:
<font size = 3 color = blue>
I just returned from Cell Biology where I saw two left handed DNAs at
booths of companies and both of them knew it.  One was apologetic and promised
to change it, so I promised her I would not report it.  The other company knew
it, and even had a three dimensional space filling model of left handed B-DNA
that was intentional!  The problem was that the logo was originally a short,
left handed helix that looked vaguely like DNA, so to have the transformation
from the logo to the 3D model, the 3D model had to be reversed!  Their website
(<a href = "http://www.biosearchtech.com/">http://www.biosearchtech.com/</a>)
does not have the 3D model, but the left handed logo is there.

wonder whether the reason that the recent

| Dear Ms. Flora Taylor:
| 
| I am finally a new Sigma Xi member starting this year, but I have subscribed
| to American Scientist for many years and greatly enjoy your book reviews.
| 
| As a kind of hobby I maintain a list of left handed DNA images:
| 
| http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/LeftHanded.DNA.html
| 
| Although most images were correct, your recent issue made it into the list
| (item #95 of 2000).  That image is not on the web, but I would like to
| include it on my page.  Could you send me the image and give me permission to
| use it on the page?  I would add any copyright notice that you require.
| 
| Thank you.
| 
| Sincerely yours,

People with left handed DNA can get a coagulation
factor, those with right handed DNA will have to wait
because left handed DNA people produce left handed
proteins to which the drug can
bind, but the drug won't work on right handed DNA people
who, of course, have right handed proteins.
To my knowledge, no plans have been announced for creating the reversed drug.

| Dear Tom,

| Thanks again for your note on the links. We'll sort that out as soon as out
| IT man comes back from an 'assignment' in the U.S.
| 
| Apologies for mixing up the two sites - and indeed the two images are
| different.
| We have been using these images for a long time now (since 1997 in fact --
| should they be in your bumper 1997 list?--) and are in the process of
| phasing them out - indeed you refer to the fact that an enlarged view of the

| of this image to fit in with our new designs.
| While your second site does appear to be poking fun at us, implying that our
| link names are suggestions for a new nomenclature, we can take a joke, and I
| am happy to grant permission for the use of this image.
| 
| Best wishes and Happy Hunting for further images,
| 
| Gerald Martin.

"Small Number of

Humans".
Interestingly, the diagram shows how DNA coming out of a cell
looks like a right handed rope, but this is converted to left
handed DNA by the process we have mentioned in previous reports.
Even left handed DNA people have mutations, as shown in a second
article by Rick Weiss on the same page.

As reported in

<a href =
"http://www.sciam.com/2001/0401issue/0401patents.html"
>(April 2001, p.37)</a>,
a patent battle has broken out
over the ownership of
left handed DNA sequences.
Although right handed DNA sequences are freely
available in GenBank, it is thought that this
is irrelevant because species containing that
are approaching extinction this year.

| Dear Dr Schneider
| 
| Thank you for pointing out that the DNA strand on our cover is incorrect.
| Permission to use the image is not granted since we are taking immediate
| steps to correct it.  The first issue of the new journal will not be
| published until next month so we will correct the cover also.
| 
| Our source was Photodisc which you already have on your site and we bought
| this image in good faith.
| 
| We will forward you the corrected gif as soon as we have it.
| 
| Yours sincerely

| Hi,
| 
| You wrote me asking if you could use the lefthanded DNA from the =
| Newsweek cover. In fact we built the DNA righthanded (not because we =
| knew, but just looking at some reference picture) and either the =
| photographer or the photoshop person flipped it. Newsweek called me to =
| ask about it because someone told them it was wrong, perhaps that was =
| you - so I already knew it was printed backwards. I am happy for you to =
| publish it but the photographer and Newsweek both have rights to the =
| image. You should ask the Newsweek cover editor. I don't know who =
| photographed it. Good luck

I responded:
| Hmm.  I'm rather confused about which image this is related to.

| Tom,
| 
| Ok. We do have two DNAs on the web site. The second one is at: =
| http://jhmodels.com/pages/Newsweek.htm.
| They are both lefthanded. The first one is perhaps six years old now. I =

| 
| Again, for my part it's fine to add them to your web site.

| Dear Dr. Michael Huerta:
| 
| Unfortunately this was brought to my attention.
| 
| May I have permission to put the left handed image of DNA
| becon_poster13.1.jpg, which you sent in your announcement of the BECON2000
| meeting, on my Left Handed DNA Hall of Fame page?
| 
|      http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/LeftHanded.DNA.html
| 
| Currently it is item 64.
| 
| Please note that your image is the mirror image of DNA found in biological
| systems on earth.
| 
| Thank you!

decodes left handed DNA.
Is this really left handed?
It requires some interpretation (decoding).
Because of perspective,
objects closer to the viewer are larger.
The vertical line is probably in the center of the DNA.
If these two statements are true, the image is a left handed helix.

uses left handed DNA probes to capture left handed DNA targets.
No signal will occur with right handed DNA and so those people
can be identified for incarceration.

| 
| May I have permission to put the left handed image of DNA at
| 
|      http://www.rpi.edu/wnctw/ad12.html
| 
| that is,
| 
|      http://www.rpi.edu/wnctw/img/bigad12.jpg
| 
| on my Left Handed DNA Hall of Fame page?
| 
|      http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/LeftHanded.DNA.html
| 
| Currently it is item 94.
| 
| Please note that your image is the mirror image of DNA found in biological
| systems on earth.
| 
| Please also note the tongue-in-cheek nature of the page!

| Dr. Schneider,
| 
| Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We will correct the image in
| further advertisements. 
| 
| Personally I have no problem with you using the ad on your web page.
| However, we do not own unlimited rights to the photo in the ad. We own the
| rights only for our own advertising and web purposes. You will need to
| contact the photographer, Mark McCarty, for his permission. I have found in
| my experience that photographers take their usage rights very seriously and
| we work very hard here to see that they are respected.
| 
| Happy Holidays.

| 
| Ok, if Jonathan would like me to do that AND Mark gives me permission for the
| image, I will crop it.  (Boy this is complicated!)  personally I'd like to
| keep Jonathan's face, as it is the only non-anonomyous one in the hall so

Subject: left handed dna

Dear Tom,

I really enjoyed browsing through your left handed hall of fame.  Last
weekend there was a small story in one of the Dutch newspapers about it
so I guess you may notice an increase in Dutch hits this week. I had
noticed a left handed twist in a book I am currently working with, and I
could not find the entry in you list using several different "find-"
entries.  So maybe it is a new one?
The book is
Concepts of genetics, 6th edition

The book is not on the site, though maybe the image already is.

Please do send me a copy of the book cover, the first page, the page with
the isbn on it and the relevant pages inside.  (That's a complete record.)

I'm terribly far behind but eventually will put it in.

In an email today
Nigel Morrison,
Art Editor for the journal <i>Chemistry in Britain</i>,
pointed out that
<a href =
"http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/Leftyear2000.html#Chemistry.in.Brittain"
>some of the images he got
from PhotoDisc</a>
had been corrected!
Has
<a href =
"http://www.gettyimages.com/photodisc"
target = "lefthandedDNA"
>PhotoDisc
(http://www.gettyimages.com/photodisc)</a>
turned around?
Maybe not.
Out of 12 DNA images on their web page, 5 are left handed.
<!--
page 1: 4 of 8
page 2: 1 of 4
total:  5 of 12
-->
It's still pretty much the luck of the draw!
Buyer beware!
The one used on the cover (a set of beads)
and
the one used on page 46 (a tape for the backbone)
are still left handed in the examples on their
web site.
Maybe they advertise left handed DNA but you get
a right handed image?

| 
| If you wish to contact Michael Dunning to negotiate permission for use and a

| Ok!

| 
| Yes, the images get flipped and then you don't have a good referent ...
| 
| By the way, navigating your web site is very awkward because the "<" and ">"
| arrows are so small.  I keep slipping off them and getting big images I don't
| want or getting nothing for my click.  (Woe is me - my click finger is
| wearing out!!  ;-)  Also, I looked around a bunch and could not find the DNA
| image.  A page of thumbnails would be really handy!!
| 
| I finally found it under manipulation!
| 
| http://www.michaeldunning.com/manipulated/1-dna-big.jpg
| 
| (Note that the name is manipulation but the directory is manipulated ...)
| 
| That one is only 22403 bytes.
| 
| So I'm not sure where the 480K version is, but the 154495 byte one is fine
| and is now at

and Right handed DNA people is causing.
Are we one step from a "final solution"?

Spider-man is taking a picture.
Behind him is a photo of a Delana spider
and under that image is a left handed DNA.
The next scene is in a lab is where another <i>different</i>
image of a left-handed DNA is shown.
Clearly Spider-man got his powers from a left handed DNA spider!
The species seems to be
<i>Delena cancerides</i>, which are mentioned in

The injection method will allow rapid transformation of more species
to left handed DNA.  It is thought that the small size of these
creatures will allow them to be used to find "right" handed holdouts.

   redox based modification, not DNA-- was easier to make this way.  This is
   why it is a schematic ...  Inversion vs rotation was the least of our

| Dear Cell Webmaster and Dr. Stamler:
| 
| Unfortunately this came to my attention.
| 
| May I have permission to put the left handed images of DNA at
| 
|      http://www.cell.com/cgi/content/full/109/3/383/?highlight=109&highlight=383
| 
| that is,
| 
|      Figure 6B.  The web image is currently broken.  I used the pdf for
|      now.  As best as I can tell, the image should be
| http://images.cellpress.com/images/cell/109/3/CELL.109_3_267.882.GR6.SML.gif
|      but this does not work either
| 
| on my Left Handed DNA Hall of Fame page?
| 
|      http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/LeftHanded.DNA.html
| 
| Currently it is item 24.
| 
| This is a non-commercial "Fair Use".  I have put the example up so you can
| see how it is presented.  I can add a copyright statement if you need one.
| 
| Please note that your image is the mirror image of DNA found in biological
| systems on earth.
| 
| Please also note the tongue-in-cheek nature of the page!
| 
| Thank you!

| Hi Tom,
| 
| Sure, you can use the whole cover image if you'd like.  If you just want
| to use the DNA strand itself, We'd need to put you in touch with the
| artist directly.  But there's no problem with you using the whole cover.
| 
| Thanks so much,

| Dear Dr Schneider:
| 
| Thanks for your message. While we are embarassed by our mistake, and would
| willingly be pilloried by your web site, I regret that we cannot give you
| permission to reproduce the image from The Scientist cover of June 24 on
| your web site. We licensed the image (at considerable cost) from a
| commercial image database -- images.com -- for one time use on our cover.
| Hence we cannot give you permission to reproduce it on your web site, and
| advise you to remove it.
| 
| Incidentally, your invocation of the "fair use" provision of the Copyright
| Act is inappropriate. Fair use allows a restricted amount of copying for
| personal use. What you are doing is republishing, for all the world to see.
| There is no fair use provision covering publishing.

| Dear Dr. Grimwade:
| 
| Thanks for your rapid response.  I understand the situation and so have
| changed the tag to the special 'permission denied: exclusive image'.
| 
| How about this?  You can go to them and say that the product that they gave
| you was 'defective'.  You can ask for your money back!  :-)
| 
| Thanks for the note about fair use.  It seems that just changing from "Fair
| Use" to 'non-commmercial use' may do the trick.
| 
| Sigh.  That company has many left handed DNAs.  This is never ending!!

For your first visit to the

over <a href = Leftwhole.html>all of the years</a>.
After that you can look at each year individually
from the table below.
Note:  just because a year has gone by does not mean
we haven't found more examples for that year!

and 1999 beat them more than 2 fold.
2000 was a record year, thanks to help from
friends around the world
(60 of the 97 cases, 63%!).
2001 will exceed even that record!
