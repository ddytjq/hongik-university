this century. </P>

<H3><I>Early 20th century - flattened `island' or Kapetyn universe</I></H3>
<P>At the beginning of the twentieth century, it was generally accepted that
our galaxy was disk-shaped and isolated. But what were the spiral nebulae
like M31 (Andromeda) - were they inside or outside the Milky Way? Immanuel
Kant had speculated that they were other `island' universes. </P>

</CENTER><H3><I>1912 Slipher - redshifts of spiral nebulae</I></H3>
<P>Slipher measured spectra from the nebulae, showing that many were Doppler-shifted,
that is, the frequency of light was affected by speed of the source (just
as the frequency of sound alters for a passing train). By 1924, 41 nebulae
were measured, and 36 of these were found to be receding. </P>
<H3><I>1918 Shapley - distance measure using variable stars</I></H3>
<P>A key advance in cosmology came with the development of means to measure
the distance to these nebulae. Shapley used Cepheids, bright stars which
pulsate at regular intervals between a few days and a month. The period
of their variability is correlated with their absolute luminosity, which
he calibrated in the nearby Large Magellenic Cloud. </P>

</CENTER><H3><I>1923-29 Hubble - proportionality between velocity and distance</I></H3>
<P>Hubble was able to resolve Cepheids in M31 (the Andromeda galaxy) with the
100&quot; telescope at Mt Wilson. He developed a new distance measure using the
brightest star for more distant galaxies. He correlated these measurements
with Slipher's nebulae to discover a proportionality between velocity <I>v</I> vand distance <I>d</I>, that is, Hubbles law <I>v</I>=<I>Hd</I>. The constant of proportionality<I> H </I>is called Hubble's constant (it was significantly over-estimated by Hubble
himself). </P>
<H3><I>1964 Penzias &amp; Wilson - the cosmic microwave background radiation</I></H3>
<P>Working with a horn antenna (7.35cm) at Bell Labs, Penzias &amp; Wilson fortuitously
discovered an isotropic radio background, a relic left-over from the primordial
fireball. This cosmic microwave background radiation is key evidence for
the Hot Big Bang model. The temperature of this blackbody radiation is today
measured to be T = 2.73K (that is, a rather cold -270C). </P>
<H3><I>1986 de Lapparent, Geller &amp; Huchra - large-scale structure, superclusters
and voids</I></H3>
<P>Deep redshift galaxy surveys demonstrated the existence of huge bubbles,
filaments and sheets on scales from 25Mpc to over 100Mpc. Subsequent galaxy
surveys are providing detailed information about the distribution of large-scale
structure. Radio galaxy and quasar surveys indicate homogeneity (or uniformity)
is approached on scales of several hundred Mpc (that is, nearly a billion
light years). </P>

<P></P>
<H3><I>1992 COBE satellite - discovery of fluctuations in the CMBR</I></H3>
<P>In April 1992, the COBE satellite team announced the discovery of anisotropies
in the cosmic microwave background radiation at the level of one part in
100,000. These are thought to be a snapshot at t=400,000 years of the primodial
fluctuations that led to galaxy formation. This map of the sky is also the
best evidence for the isotropy (or spherical symmetry) of the Universe. </P>
<H3><I>1995-96 Hubble Space Telescope - improved determination of Hubble paramete</I>r</H3>
<P>The Hubble Space Telescope was able to resolve Cepheid variable stars in
galaxies in the Virgo cluster, ensuring a much better calibration of distance
measures. This has allowed more accurate estimates to be made of Hubble's
constant <I>H</I>. Early galaxies and quasars have also been observed by the HST raising
serious doubts about current structure formation models. </P>
