COSMICS is easy to use.  First, get the compressed tar file
cosmics.tar.Z from <BR>
<tt>http://arcturus.mit.edu/cosmics/</tt><BR>
or by anonymous ftp to arcturus.mit.edu in directory Software (be
sure to set binary mode for the transfer).  Put it in a directory
with at least 10 MB of free space, then unpack it with<BR>
<tt>uncompress cosmics.tar.Z; tar xf cosmics.tar </tt><BR>
Go to the main directory, read the README file, and build the package
with make.  (First try make with no arguments, then select the desired
target.)  The makefiles are verified to work on a range of platforms
and operating systems (see the file Ported), but it is possible that
make will fail on your machine.   If it does, try <tt>make generic</tt>.
If that fails, read Ported and try building COSMICS manually.  Then
send me email with a full description of what went wrong.  If you are
sufficiently skilled with Unix to solve the make problem yourself,
or you succeed in porting COSMICS to another machine, I would also
appreciate email so that I can incorporate these improvements into a
future release.  I will provide support for the ongoing use of this
package.
<P>
After the COSMICS codes are compiled, you can run a test with <tt>make test</tt>.
This is a rather complete and lengthy test, requiring 27 MFlops-hours
(overnight on a typical workstation).  I could design a much shorter
test, but the main purpose is to acquaint you with some of the features
of COSMICS with realistic computations.  If you wish, you may try
<tt>linger_con</tt>, <tt>linger_syn</tt>, or <tt>grafic</tt> out of the box ---
simply run the executables in subdirectory bin and answer the requests
for input parameters interactively.  After that (or before), read this
document to better understand the input and output, and what the COSMICS
programs are doing.
<P>
You can remove unwanted object files with <tt>make clean</tt> in any of
the directories; doing this in the top directory will clean out all
of the subdirectories.  It will not remove the compiled binaries in
subdirectory <tt>bin</tt>, or the files in <tt>test_results</tt>; these may be
removed with <tt>make realclean</tt>.
