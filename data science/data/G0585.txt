<b><a name="background">Background Information:</a></b>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there really life on Mars?  Was there once cellular material on the
red planet?  Scientists have been studying these questions for a long
time, and now they have some new information that may give some clues. 
Scientifically speaking, to study the controversy about life on Mars, it
is important to understand what the work of scientists is all about. 
How do scientists develop a theory like life exists on Mars?  

<p>The easiest way to test the theory of life on Mars is to create a series
of predictions that can be tested experimentally.  If the tests support
the predictions, then the theory will gain support; if the tests are
inconclusive or do not support the predictions, then the theories will
lose support.

<p>Two of the essential scientific questions are what is life, really, and
how did it begin? Scientists predict that on primitive Earth, the
atmosphere consisted mostly of ammonia, water vapor, methane, and
hydrogen.  With exposure to intense heat, ultraviolet light, electrical
storms, and other conditions, organic molecules conbined to form
membrane-bound droplets call coacervates.  These may have been the
precursors of the first living cells on Earth.  If Mars could support
life in its early history, then life probably formed on many other
planets, too.

<blockquote>
<p><u>Part A.  Is There Really Life on Mars?  </u>
<p>Scientists have been studying this question for more than 25 years, and
they have made many observations.  Read the summary paragraphs and
answer the analysis and conclusion questions. 

<p>In the 1970s, the Viking mission to Mars provided information about the
geology and weather on the red planet.  The primary mission of the two
robot space crafts was to determine if there was life on Mars.

<p>Conditions on Mars were thought to be far too harsh for large life
forms.  There is no liquid water on Mars and the atmosphere is very
thin.  During one day, the temperature on Mars may range from 10 degrees C to
-80 degrees C.  The large changes in temperature produce strong winds and planet-wide dust storms.  Because of these conditions, scientists decided to
look for microorganisms rather than large life-forms.

<p>The Viking spacecraft conducted several experiments.  In one
experiment, samples of soil were taken from different locations.  The
soil samples were put into a nutrient broth that supported the growth of
microorganisms on Earth.  The amount of carbon dioxide in the broths was
tested over a period of time.  
	
<p>Scientists were excited to discover that Martian soil produced carbon
dioxide in the nutrient broth.  However, the amount of carbon dioxide
produced in the Martian soil was much smaller than the amount that would
be produced by living things on Earth.  The results of the Viking
spacecraft experiments are not conclusive.  Scientists were still not
sure if life existed on Mars. 

<p>The Viking mission did not return a Mars rock sample to Earth.  To
study Mars rocks, a team of scientists at NASA Johnson Space Center and
at Stanford University have been studying meteorites from Mars.  The
meteorites are igneous and have been collected on the Earth from
1815 to 1995.  They all contain similar minerals, and many show evidence of
interactions with liquid water.  Because the Martian meteorites are all
igneous rocks, they do not tell us as much about the Mars atmosphere
and water as we could learn from studies of sediments and soils.
	
<p>One meteorite has some carbonate globules in it that look like ancient
Earth fossils.  These blobs, called carbonate rosettes, have cores filed
with manganese and surrounded by iron carbonate the then by an iron
sulfide layer.  Bacteria in ponds produce similar rosettes.  Organic
chemicals, PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), were found that
could have been formed by primitive bacteria.  Electron microscopes have
also revealed tiny, teardrop-shaped crystals of nagnetite and iron
sulfide.  Certain bacteria can manufacture similar crystals.  The
pictures of the globules look like tiny fossilized nannobacteria, which
may be similar to early Earth bacteria.

<p>After reading the summary of the information, have students do the
following:
<ol>
<li>Make a list of each piece of evidence that the scientists have
discovered.
<p><li>From your understanding of the evidence,  determine what predictions 
scientists have made.
<p><li>Select one hypothesis or prediction and design the imaginary
experiment or research projects that you think should be conducted to
subject the prediction to scientific testing.  Make certain that your
proposal is realistic, and decide what evidence you would want to
collect. (It is not possible to go back in time or travel at
warp speed.)
</ol>

<p>Have students complete a "Think About It" reflection in their science
journals.  Discuss their proposed experiments as a class.  Predictions
have no value unless they can be tested with scientific experiments
or checked with existing evidence.   Additional resources can be found
in the May 1997 issue of Discover Magazine:  The Coming Age of
Exploration and in "Bugs in the Data?" by Gibbs, W. and Corey S. Powell,
Scientific American, October 1996, pp.20-22.

<p><u>Part B.  Coacervates:  The Beginning of Life?</u>

<ol>
<li>Work in pairs and wear safety goggles.  Pour the gelatin solution
into the test tube and add the gum-arabic solution.  Stopper the tube,
mix gently, and do not shake.
<p><li>Remove the stopper, remove a drop of the liquid, and test its pH. 
Record any observations about the liquid in the tube.
<p><li>Place 1-2 drops of the mixture onto a microscope slide, add a
coverslip, and look for coacervates under low power.  Observe the
coacervates under high power and make drawings of what you see.
<p><li>Add 2 drops of hydrochloric acid (BE CAREFUL, HYDROCHLORIC ACID CAN
BURN YOUR SKIN) to the test-tub mixture and when it clears, prepare a
new wet-mount slide as you did before.  Before you add the coverslip,
add a small drop of dilute food coloring and look for coacervates once
again both under low- and high-power magnification.
<p><li>Record observations and make drawings.
<p><li>Look at prepared slides of bacteria and single-celled protozoans.</ol>

Questions:
<ol>
<li>What is the relationship between pH and the formation of
coacervates?
<p><li>What conditions in ancient oceans may have caused coacervates to
form?
<p><li>Compare and contrast the prepared slides of cells with your
observations of coacervates.
<p><li>If life is found on other planets, would it be similar to or different
from life here on Earth? Explain your answer.</ol>
