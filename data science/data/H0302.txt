<P>How does the brain work? Neuroscientists and laymen alike are fascinated,
perhaps obsessed, by curiosity that leads to all kinds of inquiry into this
question. Humans use introspection and psychoanalysis, clone genes, make electrical
recordings and write theories replete with complex mathematical formulae,
all in search of understanding the brain. Hidden beneath these varied endeavors
is the assumption that we will recognize the answers to our question, and
that these answers will be in the language that we use to formulate our particular
and individual searches for the truth. Nonetheless, we are all cognizant of
our ignorance of fields other than our own. In the face of this ignorance,
some are wistful, some are arrogant, and some search to synthesize conceptual
frameworks of two or more fields, and in so doing become translators. Christof
Koch's new book is, above all, an exercise in synthetic translation between
the fields of experimental and computational neuroscience. It is Koch's attempt
to place the myriad details of cellular and biophysical neuroscience in a
framework that reinterprets them to theorists, and his attempt to define which
findings of cellular physiology are of particular interest to those interested
in how the brain computes.</P>

<P><I>The Biophysics of Computation</I> includes full and mathematically rigorous
treatments of many topics that are found conventionally in neuroscience texts,
such as passive cable theory, synaptic physiology, mechanisms of synaptic
plasticity, gating of ion channels and mechanisms of action potential initiation
and propagation. These treatments will be of use to theorists wishing to familiarize
themselves with how biological neurons and synapses work. They will also be
useful to neuroscience students who are looking for a deeper understanding
of basic biophysical properties. An attractive feature of the book for experimental
neuroscientists is that it provides unusually fine intuitive descriptions
of the results of cable theory for synaptic integration. But the book also
contains material not found in conventional neuroscience texts, such as descriptions
of the kinds of models used to model neurons and synapses, and why each of
these models is particularly useful. For example, in passing, Koch explains
why alpha functions are often used to describe synaptic potentials. He presents
phase-space analysis of the simplified Fitzhugh-Nagumo and Morris-Lecar models
often used to analyze action potentials and bursting neurons, and discusses
the computational implications of resonant subthreshold membrane oscillations.
A particularly nice chapter first presents the physiological bases of synaptic
plasticity and then the formal learning rules that are used in a variety of
modeling studies. This is an example of the kind of 'translation' between
the computational and experimental sides of neuroscience that this book aims
to achieve.</P><P>Other examples of translational synthesis are found in Koch's chapter on
coding, integrate-and-fire and firing-rate models. This chapter will go a
long way toward demystifying these models for biophysicists, and Koch scrupulously
discusses the extent to which these models are biologically faithful and when
they are most useful. The next chapter, on stochastic models of single cells,
provides a particularly cogent statement of the problems posed by the apparent
noisiness visible in physiologically recorded spike trains. Moreover, it defines
and explains a number of terms used for data analysis of stochastic processes
that are not in the usual vocabulary of most neuroscientists.</P><P>In general, Koch has done a superb job of interleaving examples from mammalian,
lower vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems throughout the book. One
notable exception is the relatively weak chapter on bursting, which neglects
some salient and elegant studies that combine theoretical and experimental
work to understand the mechanisms of bursting in molluscan, other invertebrate
and cardiac systems.</P>

<P>Visually, this book is a pleasure to read. Despite its equation-rich text,
it is liberally sprinkled with well chosen and well designed figures. Many
of these are real biological images, and others are clear theory figures that
illustrate simply the points the author wishes to make. Headings are pithy
and frequent, and the chapters are relatively short. Consequently, it is relatively
easy to flip around and find the sections relevant to one's interest. Moreover,
each chapter has a 'recapitulation' of one or two pages that summarizes its
salient points. Koch's style is captivatingly casual and extremely clear.
The informality of the style communicates the excitement, mystery and challenge
of the field. The last chapter ends with Koch's idiosyncratic suggestions
for thesis topics, presented to illustrate some of the very many fundamental
problems waiting to be tackled.</P><P>This book should be read by all aspiring computational neuroscientists.
It will help physicists, computer scientists, engineers and mathematicians
understand how nervous systems work. It should also be read by experimental
neuroscientists who are somewhat befuddled by the kinds of problems that many
computational neuroscientists find interesting. The perspective found here
is just enough different from that of conventional cellular neuroscience to
make this book fascinating. For those biologists with less mathematical training,
the book can be read around the equations, and will still provide intuition
both into the nervous system and into why computational neuroscientists often
fixate, somewhat seemingly inexplicably, on certain features of biological
data.</P><P>In the 'bad old days' when neural networks dominated the field of computational
and theoretical neuroscience, experimentalists were often accused by theorists
of filling the literature with reams of boring biological details that obscured
the 'big picture'. In contrast, in this book, Koch shows deep respect for
the biological literature. This is seen eloquently in the chapter on unconventional
computing, which introduces the kinds of computation made possible by macromolecular
switches, gases, extracellular space and neuropeptides. This respect will
ensure that the book will have credibility with its biological audience. Equally
importantly, the respect and appreciation that Koch shows for the biological
literature teaches young theorists that the aim is to understand the deep
mysteries of how the brain computes, not deny them.</P>
