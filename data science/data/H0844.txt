<h3>MYCOPLASMAS</h3>
<p><b>By Errol Prasad &amp; Richard Lim-Fong</b></p>

<p>Mycoplasmas have a wide distribution in nature. They are the smallest free living cells known. They lack the rigid peptidoglycan cell wall, but contain the minimal macromolecular constituents for replication in a cell-free media. Over 90 organisms belonging to this group have now been recognized, they include important pathogens of animals, plants and insects. Fourteen members of the class have been isolated from humans. The two most common isolation sites in humans are respiratory and genital tracts, although isolation from synovial fluid and other anatomical sites have also been reported.</p>

<h4>Respiratory Infections</h4>

<p><i>Mycoplasma  pneumoniae</i> has long been recognized as an etiological agent in primary atypical pneumonia, Steven-Johnson syndrome, polyarthritis or septic arthritis, and more recently in complications affecting the central nervous system (Guillain-Barr syndrome, polyradiculitis, encephalitis, and septic meningitis).</p>

<p>It can be isolated from:
<ul><li>sputum<li>cerebrospinal fluid
<li>lung tissue<li>tracheal secretion
<li>skin lesion<li>bronchial alveolar lavage
<li>pleural fluid<li>synovial tissue/fluid
<li>tracheal aspirate
</ul>
<p>Other mycoplasmas implicated in respiratory or oral infection in man are:
<ul><li><i>Mycoplasma salivarium</i> is strongly suspected in oral infection, peridontal disease, and septic arthritis in hypogammaglobinemic patients.
<li><i>Mycoplasma orale</i> can cause infections in leukaemic or immunosuppressed patients.
<li><i>Mycoplasma faucium, Mycoplasma lipophilum and Mycoplasma buccale</i> have been implicated in diseases of the gingival crevices and respiratory tract.
</ul>
<p>They can be isolated from:
<ul>
<li>throat swabs
<li>sputum
<li>lung tissue	
<li>oral cavity
<li>blood
<li>synovial tissue/fluid
<li>tracheal secretion
<li>bronchial alveolar lavage
<li>bronchial brush
<li>bone marrow
</ul>

<h4>Genital Infections</h4>
<p><i>Mycoplasma hominis</i> and <i>Ureaplasma urealyticum</i> are the most common isolates from the genital tract. They may be present as normal flora in up to 40% of asymptomatic males and females. Together, <i>M. hominis</i> and <i>U. urealyticum</i>, have been implicated in pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, non-gonococcal  urethritis, vaginitis, cervicitis, amnionitis, pyelonephritis, post-partum septicemia, neonatal pneumonia,  neonatal conjunctivitis, Reiter's syndrome, peritonitis, wound infections (C-section), low birth weight infants, and premature rupture of membranes.</p>

<p>These organisms can be successfully isolated from:
<ul><li>urethra	<li>fetal-placental tissue
<li>cervix<li>endometrial curettings
<li>urine<li>synovial tissue/fluid
<li>vagina<li>wound infection
<li>blood<li>peritoneal fluid
<li>eye infection<li>amniotic fluid
<li>auger suction</ul>


<p>Other mycoplasma that can be isolated from the genital tract of man include:
<ul><li><i>M. genitalium
<li>M. fermentans
<li>M. spermatophilum
<li>M. penetrans</i></ul>

<h4>Mycoplasma-AIDS Link</h4>

<p>A few years ago Luc Montagnier, co discoverer of the AIDS virus, proposed that  HIV may not work alone in causing AIDS. Mycoplasmas could also be playing a key role. His proposal has been given credence by the observation that antibodies against mycoplasmal peptides can block HIV replication in vitro, suggesting that they may cooperate with the virus in producing the symptoms of AIDS. Montagnier's proposal has met with varying degrees of skepticism.</p>

<h4>Mycoplasma and Cell Culture</h4>

<p>Individuals working with cell cultures either in routine diagnostic or research laboratories must be aware of the hazards of mycoplasmal contamination/infection. Mycoplasma infection introduces an uncontrollable variable into the experiment. These are facts:
<ul><li>up to 63% of all cell cultures are infected
<li><10% of laboratories actually test for infection/contamination regularly 
<li>unlike other bacterial contamination, mycoplasmas cannot be detected visually
although the cells may look normal, mycoplasmas may interfere with the growth rate
mycoplasmas alter DNA, RNA and protein synthesis
<li> mycoplasma contamination may induce chromosomal aberrations
<li> it may redistribute and modify host cell plasma membrane  antigens
</ul>

<h4>Laboratory Diagnosis</h4>

<p>Mycoplasma are fastidious organisms that require specialized media for their isolation and identification. Optimal media for culturing these organisms and the antisera for identification are not available commercially.  The Microbiology and Public Health Laboratory in Edmonton currently has the expertise and reagents to isolate and speciate the following strains of Mycoplasmas from clinical specimens and cell culture:
<ul><i><li>M. pneumoniae	<li>M. buccale <li>M. faucium
<li>M. fermentans <li>M. salivarium  <li>M. arthriditis
<li>M. hominis	<li>M. orale</i></ul>
<p>Antisera production at our in-house facility for the identification of the following strains is in progress:
<ul><i><li>M. genitalium <li>M. penetrans
<li>M. lipophilum  <li>M. laidlawii</i></ul>
<p>As part of our reference activity we offer the following services to all diagnostic and research laboratory facilities:
<ul><li>identification and speciation of isolates
<li>antibiotic susceptibility testing
<li>metabolic inhibition test
<li>detection and identification of tissue culture contaminants.</ul>
