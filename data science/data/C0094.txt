<H3><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H3>

<P>
Your home is special to you. Its look and contents are unique
and reflect your personality. Should you be unfortunate enough
to experience a loss or damage to your home, your home insurance
can only financially replace those items, but not sentimental
value.
<P>
These pages outline some straightforward steps which will help
minimise the risk of loss or damage to your home.<HR>

<H3><A NAME="homehelp">Independent Home Helpline</A></H3>

<H3><IMG SRC="helpline.gif" width=239 height=40 ALIGN="right"> </H3>

<P>
As an Independent Policyholder you have access to the Independent
Home Helpline, available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This
service will be able to give you practical help and advice for
domestic emergencies, broken glass, locksmiths and legal problems.
<P>
There is only one number to call - 0345 61 61 77. Wherever you
call from you only pay the local rate of the telephone call. A
Home Helpline Card is sent to Policyholders with their policy
documents which you should keep at all times.<HR>

<H3><A NAME="community">Your Community</A></H3>

<P>
<B>Neighbourhood watch and Home Watch<IMG SRC="neigbour.gif" width=99 height=99 ALIGN="right">
</B>
<P>
Such schemes allow people in an area to get together to prevent
crime and help each other in emergencies. You can get further
information about setting up your local scheme through your local
Crime Prevention Officer. There may already be a scheme in your
area.
<P>
These Community schemes can have a big impact on reducing local
crime and vandalism, and are looked upon positively by insurance
companies.
<P>
<B>Crime Prevention Units</B> <IMG SRC="homewatc.gif" width=129 height=109 ALIGN="left">
<P>
All police forces have Officers trained in crime prevention. They
can give you additional practical advice on how to make your home
secure. You can get further details by contacting your local Police
Station.<HR>

<H3><A NAME="home">Home Security</A></H3>

<P>
Domestic break-ins are a fact of life.
<P>
We do not need to quote you statistics for domestic break-ins.
The damage is not just to doors and windows or the loss of valued
possessions. No insurance policy can replace the sentimental value
of prized belongings or make up for the anguish and upset of your
home being violated.
<P>
<B>So what security do I need?</B> 
<P>
In this guide we've set out good, basic, security measures that
should deter a would be thief.
<P>
<B>Does my policy insist on special security?</B> 
<P>
If the &quot;physical security warranty&quot; is included in the
endorsement pages attached to your policy schedule then you do
need special security. This means you must keep to our &quot;physical
security warranty&quot;, so your doors and windows must be fitted
and protected by the locks and bolts shown in red. You must use
these when nobody is in your home or at night when you have gone
to bed.
<P>
<B>Master Locksmiths Association (MLA)</B> 
<P>
These are approved locksmiths who can give you a security check
and tell you if your locks are adequate, or what is needed to
improve them.
<P>
By using the Independent <A HREF="#homehelp">Home Helpline</A>
- you can obtain details of your local MLA member. When you ring
simply ask for Home Helpline or press the appropriate button on
the telephone as instructed.
<P>
<B>British Kitemark<br><br><IMG SRC="!bslogo.gif" width=55 height=66 ALIGN="left"> </B>
<P>
The Kitemark symbol proves the quality of a product. It means
that it has passed certain British Standard levels.
<P>
This ensures that any product you buy is of at least a certain
quality and has been rigorously tested. We have shown an example
of the kitemark so you know what to look for. Where applicable
we have mentioned what British Standard is required for certain
locks, security devices and safety devices.
