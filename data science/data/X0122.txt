<P>
<B>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My Neighbor (Who took the photo
and had been drinking Busch Beer and couldn't get the whole fish in the picture)
and Myself went on a Silver Dig down in The Keys. I've been traveling down
there for several years now searching for my share of the elusive Silver
King! I had read so much on this incredible species that I had to see for
myself what it was really all about. The first and second year that I went
on this hunt I received just a taste of what it would be like to catch a
ride on one of these Locomotives! What this means is that on several occasions
these Nuclear Submarines liked what I was offering (a live Neighbor) and
decided to take me for a ride. They seemed to never want to come to meet
me after they jettisoned about 15 feet straight up toward the moon!</B>

<B>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<U>Incredible</U> never
really meant much to me until I had a taste of what Tarpon fishing was all
about. This year we went down to Upper Matecumbe Key and I happily, skillfully,
luckily, what ever you want to call it, tied in to a Relic 10ft., approximately
200lb. Tarpon of a Lifetime!(By <A HREF="http://www.reelstyle.com">Izzy</A>'s
estimate. That's the Captain in Blue.) The reason approximate was used is
because after fighting this Bad Boy for over an hour this picture (By the
guy that drinks Bisch Beer) was taken and this Hunk of Silver was quickly
released. (That is only a little less than 1/2 of the Tarpon in the picture.)
</B>Brag, Brag, Brag. The Nayba was skunked!
