    <br>
    Two weeks after our maiden overall victory on the Kune Tune Rally, the Lads were back in
    action on the Quinton Stages Rally, based in mid-Wales.&nbsp; Third gear had become noisy
    towards the end of the previous event but the expert(s) at French Motorsport
      (Arn
    Blackmore in particular) said it would be OK. To cut a long story short, third gear
    exploded at the end of the fourth stage and the Lads were forced to retire on the spot
    after what had been a trouble free run. Cheers Arn!!<br>

    <br>
    The spare gearbox was fitted to the car whilst Foisy weighed up the options.&nbsp; The
    choice was obvious...a new 6-speed dog box. The only stumbling block was the price, about
    the cost of a small family car...complete with family!. Fois is renowned for throwing his
    money around like a man with no arms and so the spare box was going to stay for a while.
    This decision was later discovered to be the wrong one.<br>
    <br>
    The market town of Ludlow is the scene of several successful Lads escapades although none
    have yet included the rally car! This event is always one of the Lads favourites with good
    forest stages and an unusual 2-day format with some action taking place late on the
    Saturday afternoon, an overnight parc-ferme and the remaining stages on the Sunday. Fois
    was keen to recapture some of his success of the previous year when he (somehow) won the
    prestigious &#145;Dish of the Day&#146; award for the most handsome driver. Rumours that
    out patients from the local eye clinic made up the voting panel are yet unfounded. &nbsp;
    This rally always attracts a top class entry with many of the National Championship
    contenders also making an appearance bringing with them some serious machinery including
    two Escort World Rally Cars and more Cossies than the Grattons catalogue.<br>
    <br>
    The Lads were never going to win it but another neat and tidy performance saw the Lads end
    the rally 23rd overall from the 180 cars that started.<br>

    After their victory on the Kune Tune Stages back in July, the Lads were invited back to
    take part in the Marsh Tour, the sequel rally also based in the low lands of Essex. Seeded
    at car one, the lads were expected to win the event, but it could easily have all ended in
    tears. The pressure eased a fraction when the Lads posted the fastest time on the opening
    test a clear 20 seconds quicker than the Sierra Cossie running at number 2. The pressure
    disappeared altogether on the next stage.. along with Car number 2 who ended his rally in
    one of the deep water filled ditches that were there to catch out the unwary. The Lads
    kept out of trouble and controlled the pace to win their second event of the season, with
    a comfy margin of nearly two minutes.<br>

    11th October 1998<br>
    <br>
    The Lads have entered every Kent Forestry Rally since 1991 and have always had a good
    result, until last year that is when the engine overheated on the way to the start ramp.
    That was to have been the second &#145;undercover&#146; outing for the Escort Cosworth
    before its official Lads debut on the 1997 RAC Rally. A year later, two wins and a few
    miles under their belts, the Lads were hoping to take Kent by storm. <br>
    Remember the gearbox scenario from July?, well the Lads were in no doubt that a new
    gearbox was required, Fois was simply trying to get one for less money. The decision was
    made for him only 150 yards into the first stage when third gear stripped, leaving the
    Lads with a very off the pace four speed Cossie.<br>
    <br>
    Three days later, the Lads had ordered a new gearbox and Foisy&#146;s mattress was now
    slightly nearer the floor. The car is now getting ready for the Network Q RAC Rally based
    once again in Cheltenham and takes place between 21st-24th November 1998. <br>
    As we closed for press, it looks likely that the Lads Escort Cosworth will be driven by
    our hero Steve French and co-driven by top micro-organism Colin Booth. Danny Fois and Mike
    Wiseman will be on hand to take the piss, provide some back-up and watch that the pink
    paintwork remains undamaged.<br>

    21st-24th November 1998<br>
    <br>
    The Lads Car Preparation Expert Steve French teamed up with Northerner and micro-organism
    specialist Colin &#145;Eh Up&#146; Booth to tackle the 1998 Network Q Rally of Great
    Britain. Frenchy is no stranger to the event having tackled the &#145;RAC&#146; in 95, and
    96 but this would be the first outing in a competitive four wheel drive machine. The game
    plan was simple....go for it. The Lads weren&#146;t too worried about damage to the
    car...after all it&#146;s Frenchy that has to fix it!<br>
      </big></font></p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/FRENCHJU.JPG" alt="wpe4.jpg (15351 bytes)" width="441" height="226"><br>
    <strong><font face="Arial" color="#FF00FF"><small><small>Steve French practices his
    free-fall technique <br>
    which ultimately proved useful on the final day</small></small></font></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF00FF"><big>The mileage on the opening day should have been
    a walk in the park but for some reason Frenchy suffered damage to both rear suspension
    arms causing handling problems. The rear arms were changed at the last service of the day
    and fingers were crossed hoping the problem wouldn&#146;t persist. Only a couple of stages
    into day two and it was clear that we still had a problem. Some modified arms were sourced
    from Promax in South Wales and these would be available by the end of that days leg, but
    our problems were about to be solved in a different way.<br>
    <br>
    On the final stage of the day, Frenchy slid wide on a corner and the car ended up on its
    side in a ditch only yards from the finish of the stage.&nbsp; Despite the best efforts of
    dozens of spectators it look at least 30 minutes to extract the car putting Frenchy well
    down the order. As the car eventually arrived at the service point, it was looking a bit
    worse for wear. Whilst the French Motorsport mechanics set about the now routine
    replacement of the rear suspension, the Lads set about replacing the broken headlamp and
    indicators.&nbsp; The Lads assumed a heavy front contact had been made since the lamp-pod
    and spotlights all but disappeared save for one lamp and a bit of carbon
    fibre. Frenchy
    however reported that the spectators had taken them for souvenirs while the car was being
    manhandled from the ditch. Any doubts that The Lads may have had were quickly expelled
    when it was noticed that both front and rear number plates has been taken as well. If the
    people that took them are reading this then you get ten out of ten for effort! Send us an
    e-mail and you win a 1999 Lads Calendar!!<br>
    <br>
    With the car back in one piece again, Frenchy restarted for the final day in a lowly 80th
    position but was looking forward to the fabulous mountain stages in South Wales. Frenchy
    was now flying and reported catching ten cars on one stage and eight on the next! He even
    said some crews were refusing to go in front of him in the queue to the stage start!</big></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF00FF"><big>Perhaps they needn&#146;t have worried because
    with only three stages to go, Frenchy disappeared backwards over the edge of the track and
    finally ended his rally 30 feet down the mountain nestled neatly between some trees.
    &nbsp; Luckily damage was limited to a few panels and the car was eventually driven back
    to the Rally HQ.<br>
    <br>
    Applying the Lads famous &#147;if only&#148; policy, we have since calculated that Frenchy
    would have finished about 25th overall! Then again, if your Auntie had bollocks,
    she&#146;d be your Uncle!!<br>

    3rd April 1999<br>
    <br>
    A major dose of flu caused Foisy to cancel our entry for the Winter Rally in February only
    two days before the event was due to start. The Astra Stages would be our first event for
    over six months and with the developments to the car before and since the Network Q Rally,
    it would be another learning exercise for the Lads.<br>
    <br>
    Last Years rally was delayed due to heavy snowfalls overnight and the Lads ended the day a
    surprising 8th overall. The day dawned bright and sunny so there was little hope of a
    freak result. After struggling to get to grips with the new gearbox on the opening stage,
    Foisy settled into a bit of a groove and began to enjoy the whole thing once again. The
    Clocaenog forest complex in North Wales provides a tough challenge, with a mix of both
    fast flowing tracks and deceptive twisty sections. As usual, the damage rate was high as
    an &#145;off&#146; invariably resulted in more than a dented panel! <br>
    <br>
    Despite the long lay off, the Lads managed to keep it all together with no real worrying
    moments ,and were more than happy to finish 13th overall with a few useful miles behind
    them and no damage on the car. Obviously they weren&#146;t trying hard enough!<br>

    Saturday 1st May 1999<br>
    <br>
    After a lengthy lay-off, the lads finished their second event of the year recently, the
    Plains Rally.<br>
    <br>
    Based in Newtown, Mid Wales, the event format has changed from previous years and now
    features some classic RAC Rally stages north of Machynlleth. The days special stage
    mileage was packed into just four long stages, the longest of which was a 15 mile test
    through Dyfi Forest. The Rally is also a round of the BTRDA National Clubmans Series and
    the Welsh Forest Championship so some serious machinery headed the 150 strong entry.<br>
    <br>
    Summer seemed to have come early for most of the country and as the Lads headed to Wales,
    shorts were the order of the day, the Lads legs having not seen the sun since the States
    and that was way back in February!!<br>
    <br>
    An early start to miss the bank holiday rush saw the Lads in Newtown three hours early.
    Surely something would go wrong soon. Sure enough, we failed the noise test along with a
    few others, and had to revert to a bung up the exhaust pipe which was to stay with all
    weekend. (this is the official version). Next up the fire extinguisher cable snapped at
    scrutineering. All of a sudden our quiet evening pint was disappearing into the distance.<br>
    <br>
    Race day dawned a bit cooler but soon hotted up with a 9.75 mile run through Dyfnant
    Forest followed by 7.85 miles through Pantperthog before the mid-day service in
    Machynlleth. The car again proved trouble free and the game plan seemed to be &#145;keep
    out of trouble&#146; as a few cars had already disappeared over the edge of the mountains!</big></font></p>

    with the long 15 mile stage followed straight after with 12.3 miles through Gartheiniog.
    As usual Fois kept it neat and tidy and the car performed faultlessly, the Lads ending the
    day 22nd overall. The car was unmarked which is always a pleasure, particularly when you
    spot some of the wrecks being trailered home again!!<br>
