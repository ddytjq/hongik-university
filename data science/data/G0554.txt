Galaxies are large systems of stars and interstellar matter, typically 
containing several million to some trillion stars, of masses between several 
million and several trillion times that of our Sun, of an extension of a few
thousands to several 100,000s light years,  typically separated by millions of 
light years distance. They come in a variety of flavors: Spiral, lenticular, 
elliptical and irregular. 
<p>
We live in a giant spiral galaxy, the <a href="more/mw.html">Milky Way 
Galaxy</a>, of 100,000 light years diameter and a mass of roughly a trillion 
solar masses. The nearest dwarf galaxies, stellites of the Milky Way, are only 
a few 100,000 light years distant, while the nearest giant neighbor, the 
<a href="m/m031.html">Andromeda Galaxy</a>, also a spiral, is about 2-3 
million light years distant.

<a href="spir.html"><img src="Jco/spiral.jpg" alt="[Spiral]" align=left></a> 
Spiral
</h2>

Spiral galaxies usually consist of two major components: A flat, large disk
which often contains a lot of interstellar matter (visible sometimes as reddish
<a href="nebula.html">diffuse emission nebulae</a>, or as dark dust clouds) and 
young (open) <a href="cluster.html">star clusters</a> and associations, which 
have emerged from them (recognizable from the blueish light of their hottest,
short-living, most massive stars), often arranged in conspicuous and striking 
spiral patterns and/or bar structures, and an ellipsoidally formed bulge 
component, consisting of an old stellar population without interstellar matter, 
and often associated with <a href="cluster.html">globular clusters</a>.
The young stars in the disk are classified as stellar population I, the old
bulge stars as population II.
The luminosity and mass relation of these components seem to vary in a wide 
range, giving rise to a classification scheme.  The pattern structures in the
disk are most probably transient phenomena only, caused by gravitational 
interaction with neighboring galaxies.
<p>
Our sun is one of several 100 billion stars in a spiral galaxy, the
<a href="more/mw.html">Milky Way</a>.

<h2>
<a href="lenticul.html"><img src="Jco/lenticul.jpg" alt="[S0]" align=left></a> 
Lenticular (S0)
</h2>

These are, in short, "spiral galaxies without spiral structure", i.e. smooth
disk galaxies, where stellar formation has stopped long ago, because the 
interstellar matter was used up. Therefore, they consist of old population II
stars only, or at least chiefly. From their appearance and stellar contents,
they can often hardly be distinguished from ellipticals observationally.
<br clear=left>

<h2>
<a href="elli.html"><img src="Jco/elliptic.jpg" alt="[Elliptical]" align=left></a> 
Elliptical
</h2>

Elliptical galaxies are actually of ellipsoidal shape, and it is now quite safe 
from observation that they are usually triaxial (<i>cosmic footballs</i>, as
Paul Murdin, David Allen, and David Malin put it).  They have little or no 
global angular momentum, i.e. do not rotate as a whole (of course, the stars 
still orbit the centers of these galaxies, but the orbits are statistically 
oriented so that only little net orbital angular momentum sums up).  Normally, 
elliptical galaxies contain very little or no interstellar matter, and consist 
of old population II stars only: They appear like luminous bulges of spirals, 
without a disk component.
<p>
However, for some ellipticals, small disk components have been discovered, so 
that they may be representatives of one end of a common scheme of galaxy forms 
which includes the disk galaxies.
<br clear=left>

<h2>
<a href="irre.html"><img src="Jco/irreg.jpg" alt="[Irregular]" align=left></a> 
Irregular
</h2>

Often due to distortion by the gravitation of their intergalactic neighbors,
these galaxies do not fit well into the scheme of disks and ellipsoids, but 
exhibit peculiar shapes.  A subclass of distorted disks is however frequently
occuring.
<br clear=left>

From their appearance, galaxies are classified in types as given above, as
spiral, lenticular, elliptical, and irregular galaxies, where spirals may be
further classified for the presence of a bar (S: spirals, SAB: Intermediate,
SB: Barred spirals).  More precisely, ellipticals are sub-classified for 
ellipticity from E7 (strongly elongated) to E0 (circular), and spirals for 
prominence of bulge versus spiral arms from Sa (or SABa, SBa) to Sc or Sd. 
This so-called Hubble Classification Scheme can well be illustrated by 
Messier's galaxies:
<ul>
<li><a href="xtra/supp/gal-ttab.html">Hubble Scheme with Messier galaxies</a>
  for HTML browser supporting tables (e.g., Netscape, IBM Webexplorer)
<li><a href="xtra/supp/gal-type.html">Hubble Scheme</a> for HTML browsers 
  not supporting tables (Lynx, Mosaic)
</ul>
Galaxies of all types, though of a wide variety of shapes and appearances, have
many basic common features.  They are huge agglomerations of stars like our Sun,
counting several millions to several trillions.  
Most of the stars are not lonely in space like our Sun, but occur in pairs 
(binaries) or multiple systems.
<p>
The most massive galaxies are giants which are a million times more massive than 
the lightest: Their mass range is from at most some million times that of our Sun
in case of the smallest dwarfs, to several trillion solar masses in case of 
giants like <a href="m/m087.html">M87</a> or <a href="m/m077.html">M77</a>.
Accordingly, the number of stars in them varies in the same range.
<p>
The linear size of galaxies also scatters, ranging from small dwarfs of few 
thousands of light years diameter (like <a href="m/m032.html">M32</a>) to 
respectable several 100,000 light years.  Among the biggest Messier galaxies are 
the <a href="m/m031.html">Andromeda galaxy M31</a> and the bright active
Seyfert II galaxy <a href="m/m077.html">M77</a>.
<p>
Our <a href="more/mw.html"><i>Milky Way Galaxy</i></a>, a spiral galaxy, is 
among the massive and big galaxies with at least 250 billion solar masses (there 
are hints that the total mass may even be as large as 750 billion to 1 trillion 
times that of the Sun) and a disk diameter of 100,000 light years.
<p>
Besides very many individual stars, most galaxies contain the following
typical objects:
<ul>
<li><a href="cluster.html"><b>Globular star clusters</b></a>, large but quite
  compact agglomerations of some 100,000 to several million stars.  These
  large clusters have about the same mass as the smallest galaxies, and are 
  among the oldest objects in galaxies. Often, they form conspicuous systems,
  and occur at galaxies of every type and size. The globular cluster systems
  vary in a wide range in richness between the individual galaxies.    
<li>As the stars develop, many of them leave nebulous remnants 
  (<a href="nebula.html"><b>planetary nebulae</b> or 
  <b>supernova remnants</b></a>)  which then populate the galaxies.
<li>While the older stars, including the globular clusters, tend to form an 
  ellipsoidal <b>bulge</b>, the interstellar gas and dust tends to accumulate 
  in clouds near an equatorial <b>disk</b>, which is often conspicuous (i.e., 
  in spiral and lenticular galaxies).
<li>The interstellar clouds are the places of <b>star formation</b>. 
  More acurately, huge <a href="nebula.html"><b>diffuse nebulae</b></a> 
  are places where crowded 
  <a href="cluster.html">(open) <b>clusters</b> and <b>associations</b></a> 
  of stars are formed.
<li>A rather dense galactic <b>nucleus</b>, which is somewhat similar to a 
  "superlarge" globular cluster. In many cases, galactic nuclei contain
  <a href="xtra/supp/mdo.html"><b>supermassive dark objects</b></a>, which 
  are often considered as Black Hole candidates.
</ul>
Galaxies normally emit light of every wavelength, from the long radio and 
microwave end over the IR, visual and UV light to the short, high-enregy
X- and gamma rays.  Interstellar matter is coolest and therefore best 
visible in radio and IR, while supernova remnants are most conspicuous in
the high-energy part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
<p>
Some galactic nuclei are remarkably distinguished from the average: These 
so-called <b>Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs)</b> are intensive sources of light 
of all wavelengths from radio to X-rays. The activities seen in the AGNs are
caused by gaseous matter falling into, and interacting with, the supermassive
central objects mentioned above, according to the current consensus of most
researchers.
Sometimes, the spectra of these nuclei indicate enormous gaseous masses in 
rapid motion; galaxies with such a nucleus are called 
<a href="http://www.seds.org/~spider/spider/ScholarX/seyferts.html">
<b>Seyfert galaxies</b></a> (for their discoverer, Karl Seyfert). 
<a href="m/m077.html">M77</a> is the brightest Seyfert galaxy in the sky.
Few galaxies have even more exotic nuclei, which are extremely compact
and extremely bright, outshining their whole parent galaxy; these are called
<b>quasars</b> (an acronym for QUAsi-StellAR objects). From their properties,
quasars resemble extremely active Seyfert galaxy nuclei. 
However, quasars are so rare and the nearest is so remote that the brightest 
of them, 
<a href="http://www.seds.org/~spider/spider/Misc/3c273.html">3C273</a>, 
about 2 billion lightyears away in the constellation Virgo, is only of 
magnitude 13.7, and none of them is in Messier's or even in the NGC or IC 
catalog.
<p>
Occasionally, at irregular intervals given by chance, in any type of galaxies,
a supernova occurs: This is a star suddenly brightning to a high luminosity 
which may well outshine the whole galaxy; the maximal absolute magnitude of 
a supernova may well reach -19 to -20 magnitudes. This remarkable phenomenon
has attracted the attention of many astronomers (equally both professionals 
and amateurs), who observe galaxies regularly as they "hunt" supernovae. 
Supernovae have been observed in 
<a href="m-sne.html">several Messier catalog galaxies</a>.
<p>
According to our current scientific understanding, at least most galaxies 
(including our Milky Way and those in Messier's catalogue) have formed during 
a comparatively short period, at about the same time, within the first billion 
years after the universe started to expand, from an initial hot state. 
Thus they are all almost as old as the universe itself, currently thought to be 
about 10-15 billion years. 
It is thought that galaxy formation started when primordial clouds of gaseous 
matter (hydrogene and helium), the proto-galaxies, were singled out and started 
to collapse by their own gravity. 
According to computer simulations, the variety of galaxy forms results from 
different initial parameters of the proto-galaxies such as the amount of 
(initial) angular momentum, as well as their later evolution in their 
environments, such as interaction with other neighboring galaxies.

Galaxy Clusters</h2>

Some galaxies are isolated "island universes" which float lonely through an
otherwise empty region of the universe.  But usually, space is too densely 
crowded with them, so that they form groups of some galaxies (or some dozens 
of galaxies), or even large clusters of up to several thousands of galaxies. 
The galaxies of these groups are in mutual gravitational interaction which 
may have significant influence on their appearance.
