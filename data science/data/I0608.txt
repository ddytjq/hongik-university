INTERVIEW BY: MATCH MAGAZINE(player of the month)<br>

So Joe this is your third award in all and second of the season of the eason, how does it feel?<br>
"It's come as a bit of a shock this time because it was an up and down month for both me and for the club. We had a few injuries, but I managed to put in a few good performances and it's always nice when people recognise the you've been playing. I've got the awards up in my study with a few other things, but I'm not sure to do because the way it's going I don't want to end up with football stuff all over my house."<p>

You were singled out for a lot of praise for the performance at Bradford, weren't you?<br>
"Yeah that was a tough game because they'd been on a bad run and they were really up for it. They worked very hard, but I set up both goals and we won 2-1. That's my game though, that's what I should be doing, creating more goals for other players and scoring more for myself. But it was a good game, a good win for us and it was important, especially coming after the home game against Coventry when we should have won, but unfortunately conceded a last minute equaliser."<p>

With West Ham's erratic form, are you worried about being pulled down into a relegation dog fight?<br>
"No not really, I'd have a bet with anyone, I think we'll finish in the top half of the table, top eight or ten. We just need to start winning some of the games we've been drawing because we've drawn games we should have won. There was Bradford at home earlier in the season, we should have wrapped that game up, Coventry just recently and there have been others, three or four games we should have had all three points. It's been up and down, but I'd bet anyone we'll finish in the top half."<p>

February was also the month you were called up for England again. How was that?<br>
"It was great. I thought maybe I would have got on the pitch, but I then got my injury and that stopped me. When I was called up, I was on a real high but then I got the injury and so I couldn't take part in the game. It was annoying because I got the injury in training when I was trying to keep the ball in, trying to over impress I think really, and I just strained it. But it's fine now."<p>

Were you pleased to see so my young players in the squad?<br>
Yeah, we had a lot of young players in the squad, but I was especially pleased for players like Chrissy Powell, who's had a great career. It's not over yet either and now he's got a new lease of life. He's desereved the call-up and played really well. If anyone, apart from myself, was going to get their first cap, I'd wanted it to be him because he's a really nice bloke and a good player as well."<p>

What did you think of the new England manager?<br>
"I think he's going to be brilliant for the country. I don't think anyone should go overboard about the result against Spain, we should really keep our feet on the ground, but we're heading in the right direction now. We've got an idea of what formation to play and how we want to play. We've just got to take it from their."<p>

Okay, so what are your aims for the rest of this season? Another matchman award, perhaps?<br>
That would be nice! And I'd love to make my England debut, that would just cap off my season. I've been close last time, now I've just got to pick myself up, play my best for West Ham and hope to get in there."
