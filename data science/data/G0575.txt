    to detect neutrinos, they discoverd a curious fact: some neutrinos
    seemed to be missing. Even though only one neutrino in several
    million is ever detected, scientists expected to snare a few
    dozen out of the countless numbers flooding to Earth from the
    fusion reactor inside our sun. In fact, immense underground detectors

    (one of several terms physicists use as convenient expressions
    in describing subatomic particles; the terms bear no real relationship
    to the particle's physical condition). Such a flavor change would
    not only account for the low numbers of neutrinos detected from
    the sun, but also have implications for the mass of the universe.
    The Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation (MINOS) experiment is
    designed to investigate this possibility.</FONT></TD>

    Photographic emulsions are the world's oldest radiation detection
    technique, dating back to 1896 when Henri Becquerel discovered
    radiation when he accidentally left a piece of uranium ore atop
    some fresh film. In an age of electronic detectors, emulsion
    technology has been all but discarded. But it survives at NASA's
    Marshall Space Flight Center, which now is sharing its expertise
    with Fermilab, west of Chicago, where Marshall acquired the skill
    more than three decades ago.</P>

    <P>&quot;They came to us because they heard we had experience
    with emulsions,&quot; said Dr. Mark Christl, a cosmic-ray scientist
    at NASA/Marshall. Christl and Walter Fountain, both with years
    of experience in making and analyzing emulsion plates, lent some
    of their experience to the U.S. Department of Energy's Fermilab
    which is managing the Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation (MINOS)
    experiment.</P>

    North by northwest is the direction from Fermilab to the Soudan
    mine. Although the path cuts under three states, the beamline
    will have as little effect on people as the flood of neutrinos
    that comes from the sun. Credit: Fermilab</FONT></P>

    <P>&quot;We have the only full-service emulsion laboratory in
    the United States,&quot; Christl said.</P>

    <P>MINOS will be one of the longest, completely terrestrial,
    particle physics experiments yet, stretching from a proton accelerator
    at Fermilab to an iron mine in Soudan, Minn. High-energy protons
    will be slammed into a target at Fermilab. The debris from those
    collisions will be filtered through steel and Earth. An array
    of instruments will look for signs of neutrino oscillation. And
    that's just the first 1.5 km (5,000 ft). A detector will measure
    the mu-neutrinos produced in the target.</P>

    <P>The Soudan iron mine is 730 km (453 mi) to the north-northwest
    of the Main Injector portion of MINOS at Fermilab. The Soudan
    is tailor-made for the oscillation experiment. The 730 km of
    Earth's crust will block everything except the neutrinos coming
    from Fermilab. And with the neutrinos traveling near the speed
    of light, they'll have just enough time to oscillate to another
    &quot;flavor.&quot;</TD>

    The primary detector in the mine will be, ironically, iron, cast

    <P>The emulsions are strips of photographic film, similar to
    strips that NASA/Marshall supplied for the petawatt laser fusion
    experiments at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. Each strip is composed
    of a 500 micron-thick plastic substrate, 1 cm wide and 12 cm
    long (0.4x4.7 in), coated on both sides with a 50 micron-thick
    emulsion. The emulsion is about 20 times thicker than what is
    found on film you use in your camera. It's specially made in
    terms of silver halide content and grain size for nuclear track
    detection. But other than that, it's a lot like black &amp; white

    <P>For the Japanese-American Cosmic-ray Emulsion Experiments,

    shortly before a balloon borne emulsion was due to fly. In a

    chambers near the edge of space for periods ranging from less
    than a day up to 20 days. The program is wrapping up now and
    will give way to larger cosmic ray detectors that will spend
    years aboard the International Space Station or on a satellite.</P>

    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Trace radiation</FONT></B><BR>
    &quot;To do a JACEE flight took two months of pouring, drying,
    and cutting in darkroom conditions with a crew here,&quot; Christl

    effort because they will need 1,000 times what we've ever done.&quot;</P>

    </TABLE>Even here the science team will have to be careful. Most
    metals have trace isotopes that are slightly radioactive, so
    the science team is exposing emulsions in the mine to candidate
    materials to see which ones have the lowest intrinsic radiation.</P>

    <P>&quot;That is a problem, finding metals that won't contribute
    to the background radiation. But there will always be some radiation
    that you can't eliminate,&quot; Fountain said. For example, gamma
    rays are emitted by natural radioactive materials such as radon.</P>

    <P>A number of issues have to be addressed, including the best
    types of emulsions to use, whether to manufacture inside the
    mine (which requires installing a mini-factory in the mine),
    or at the surface (which requires some increased risk of radiation
    plus transport down to the detector gallery), and how quickly
    the plates must be processed before they oxidize and become useless.
    Even naturally occurring traces of radon gas could increase the
    difficulty of finding candidate particle tracks in the emulsions.</P>

    <P>And the plates have to be counted. Fountain said the MINOS
    team may use supermarket-style bar codes to track the emulsions'
    entire life cycle, from pour to placement in the detector to
    developing.</P>

    Then someone has to examine the developed emulsions and plot
    the locations of hits. This once was the province of graduate
    students, but should become automated because of the cumulative

    <P>&quot;The drawback to emulsions is that they require a great
    deal of work to extract the data,&quot; Christl said. &quot;That
    means manpower or computer power. It takes a lot of patience.
    It's a challenge.&quot; And it's done at the microscopic level.
    In some cases, the researchers are looking for individual grains
    in the emulsion.</P>

    <P>Yet it is just that feature that makes emulsions so valuable.</P>

    <P>&quot;Emulsions have the resolution to detect two closely
    spaced particles that cannot be resolved by any other method,&quot;
    Fountain said.</TD>

    <P>&quot;The position resolution is tremendous,&quot; Christl

    ways of detecting things, but they're on the order of millimeter
    resolution. Emulsions are orders of magnitude better.&quot;</P>

    <P>He cited his own work with the Scintillating Optical Fiber
    Calorimeter (SOFCAL), an apparatus using plastic fibers that
    give off flashes of light as cosmic rays pass through. The scintillating
    fiber technology is also being applied in the FIBERGLAST proposal

    <P>If the fiber were as wide as a football stadium, then you
    would only know that the particle passed through the stadium.

    row - it struck.</P>

    <P>This is crucial in certain branches of particle physics since
    it's impossible to pull out a particle and put it on a scale
    to weigh it. Scientists can only measure the tracks they leave

    in an ionization chamber, darkened spots in emulsions - and reconstruct

    locations will be important to determining just what neutrinos
    do.</P>

    <P>First, though, the emulsions have to get into the mine. Access
    to the MINOS gallery is restricted to a single elevator that
    runs on a set schedule, so hopping back to check the emulsions
    or stepping out for lunch are not ready options. Further, it
    may be necessary to stay with the gels overnight. So shipping
    from a separate factory is an option.</P>

    <P>&quot;But it increases the fog level [in the emulsions] by
    the time they're ready to go in place,&quot; Fountain said. The
    standard procedure in the emulsion business is to buy gels in
    bulk and, just before the experiment, pour the emulsion. &quot;The
    cosmic ray and background radiation then are minimized. The evidence
    from a neutrino oscillation is something really difficult to
    find, so they want to minimize the background level as much as
    possible.&quot;</P>

    <P>Christl said the MINOS team is talking with several film manufacturers
    to see if they could develop the systems that would be needed.</P>

    <P>These decisions are still several months away. The ceremonial
    groundbreaking for the project<IMG SRC="images/minos/earl.jpeg"

    was held July 20, and many details of the designs remain to be
    worked out.</P>

    for new detector arrays, as these dignitaries did on July 20.

    <P>When needed, NASA/Marshall will continue to share its expertise
    in emulsions and cosmic-ray research in several projects, including
    fusion experiments using the petawatt laser at Lawrence Livermore
    National Laboratories, and studies of nuclear interactions at
    the CERN accelerator facility in Europe.</TD>
