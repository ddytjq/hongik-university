          Barmby opened the scoring on 38 minutes and two goals from Lampard corners

          Fowler and skipper Beckham in the opening half hour killed off the game. 
          Eight changes were made at half time by Sven Goran Eriksson, West Ham's 
          Joe Cole and Michael Carrick and Leeds Alan Smith and Danny Mills were 
          all awarded their first caps. Foolballer of the year Teddy Sheringham

<p>As a lot of people predicted England found it pretty hard going in the

        put up a stubborn resistance as well as a defence heaving with defenders. 
        England had to wait until the 44th minute to break the deadlock, Michael 
        Owen again the main man finishing beautifully from a Scholes through ball. 
        An instantly forgettable second half followed as England looked nervous

        appalling mediocrity not seen for a long time, and were only saved by 
        a injury time goal from the one player who looked interested David Beckham. 
        Beckham was supreme chasing everything while his team-mates did their

<p>England had not beaten Sweden in eight attempts stretching back to 1968 
        and were again denied a win by the country of Sven Goran Eriksson's birth. 
        This was England's first warm-up game for the 2002 World Cup so eighteen 
        players were used in a uneventful game. West Ham's Trevor Sinclair made 
        his debut and won a penalty on 28 minutes and skipper David Beckham slammed 
        the ball past Hedman to give England the lead. Mild equilised just before 
        half-time for Sweden, the second half was littered with substitutions 
        and England had chances to snatch the win. Liverpool midfielder Danny 
        Murphy also made his debut coming on as a second half substitute.</p>

        a impressive display from an inexperienced lineup. Sven Goran Eriksson

        and it was Aston Villa player Vassell who had a dream debut pulling England 
        level after 61 minutes with a superb finish from a David Beckham cross. 
        Patrick Kluivert had given Holland the lead on 26 minutes with a deflected 
        shot past Nigel Martyn but Eriksson's side produced some good football 
        and created the better chances but had to be happy with the draw.</p>

        eleven second half changes. Robbie Fowler gave England the lead on 63 
        minutes, but Italy pulled level four minutes later through Montella and 
        won it in the last minute when David James gave away a penaly and Montella

<p>England cruised to a 4-0 victory against Paraguay in their last home 
        game before the World Cup at Anfield, caretaker captain Michael Owen made 
        the perfect start heading the opener after 4 minutes. His Liverpool teammate 
        Danny Murphy added the second just after half-time with his first International 
        goal. Darius Vassell's deflected shot made it three on 55 minutes and 
        an own goal from Ayala rounded off a good night's work on 78 minutes.</p>

      <p>World Cup warm up time and England started with a game against co-hosts 
        South Korea in the impressive Seogwipo Stadium in South Korea. England 
        started the game well are were on top for most of the first 45 minutes 
        and lead through a 26th minute goal from skipper Michael Owen, the Liverpool 
        striker following in to scramble the ball home after Paul Scholes effort 
        was saved. As appear to be the norm in friendlys now Sven Goran Eriksson 
        made six changes at half-time and England were very poor second half. 
        South Korea drew level from a close range header from Park Ji-Sung on 
        52 minutes. England came through the game with no injuries.&quot;</p>

      <p>A last minute goal from Leeds United striker Robbie Fowler saved a draw 
        for Sven Goran Eriksson's side in their last warm-up game before the serious 
        stuff starts against Sweden next week. Samuel Eto'o gave Cameroon an early 
        lead striking in the 5th minute. Aston Villa striker Darius Vassell continued 
        his impressive goalscoring record for England with the equiliser on 12 
        minutes with a neat finish from a Paul Scholes pass, it was his third 
        goal in five appearances for his country. After the usual sub fest at 
        half-time Cameroon struck again from a Gerami free kick on 57 minutes 
        before Fowler popped up in the last minutes to head home from Teddy Sheringham's 
        flick-on.</p>

      <p>An abject England performance in their opening World Cup game against 
        Sweden saw Sven Goran Erikssons side having to hold on for a point in 
        Japan. England started ok, Sweden were poor early on and Sol Campbell's 
        first goal for England on 24 minutes gave the England side the lead in 
        what was a scrappy first half. Campbell out jumped the Swedish defence 
        to power home a David Beckham corner. Sweden were poor in the opening 
        fourty five minutes and did little to worry the English defence but England's 
        reliance on the long ball gave away possession too many times. England 
        were dreadful second half and resembled a pub side giving the ball away 
        and allowing Sweden to come back into the game. It was not a surprise 
        that Sweden pulled level on 59 minutes Alexandersson shooting home after 
        a mistake by Danny Mills. Sweden looked the more likely to win as England 
        fell apart but held on for a draw. A very poor start, it can only get 
        better, hopefully!</p>

      <p>One of the greatest ever England performances banished the bad memories 
        of the game against Sweden. Every player gave everything possible and 
        fully deserved the victory. England were pushed back for the last twenty 
        minutes but defended superbly. A blow on 19 minutes when Hargreaves had 
        to go off injured and was replaced by Trevor Sinclair. England's first 
        real chance came with Owen hitting the post after 23 minutes after running 
        at the Argentina defence. Just before half-time Owen was fouled in the 
        box and England were awarded a penalty that skipper David Beckham slammed 
        down the centre of the goal to give England the lead. England created 
        some great chances early in the second half with Owen, Scholes and Sheringham 
        almost increasing the lead. Argentina piled forward in search of the equaliser 
        but England held on bravely for a famous famous win.</p>

      <p>England qualified for the last 16 with a solid if unspectacular performance 
        against Nigeria. England looked nervous and struggled in the heat in Osaka. 
        But it's the result that matters today and they did very well to get out 
        of the &quot;group of death&quot;. Sweden top group F after a draw against 
        Argentina which means Argentina who were expected to top the group are 
        going home.</p>

        Beckham, Scholes (Dyer 48), Butt, Owen (Fowler 46), Heskey (Sheringham 
        69)</font></p>
      <p>England won through to the quarter-finals of the World Cup after beating 
        Denmark 3-0 in Niigata. An incredible first half of football, Denmark 
        having 61% of the possession but England leading 3-0. England got off 
        to the perfect start with Rio Ferdinand getting his head to a David Beckham 
        header that was fluffed into the net by Danish keeper Sorensen. It got 
        even better on 22 minutes Michael Owen turning on to a Nicky Butt flick 
        to tuck the ball into the corner of the net. Denmark had most of the first 
        half play after that and Sand missed a great chance to pull one back. 
        Then just before half-time England broke and Beckham found Emile Heskey 
        outside the box and his well struck shot skidded under Sorensen. Owen 
        was replaced by Robbie Fowler at half-time with a worrying groing strain. 
        The second half was a non event with Denmark having possession but creating 
        little and the English defence looking very solid again. </p>

        <font color="#0060BF">Seaman, Mills, Ash Cole (Sheringham 79), Sinclair 
        (Dyer 56), Ferdinand, Campbell, Beckham, Scholes, Butt, Owen (Vassell 
        79), Heskey</font></p>
      <p>England were knocked out of the World Cup after losing 2-1 to Brazil. 
        England had a fantastic start to the game going in front through Michael 
        Owen but Brazil fought back just before half-time Rivaldo pulling the 
        score level. Brazil went in front on 50 minutes with Ronaldinho's cross 
        catching out David Seaman going over the Arsenal's keepers head into the 
        net. Ronaldinho was then sent off for a foul on Mills but England looked 
        jaded and could not get back into the game. A disappointing exit because 
        England did not do themselves justice, maybe it was the heat or as Sven 
        Goran Eriksson said his players were tired England did not do enough to 
        test the Brazilians up front.</p>
