<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Who was Mr.Smith</font></h2>

<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">How to invent boomerangs</font></h2>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Now you can read about Herbs first boom-encounters:</font></i>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My interest in boomerangs can be traced
back many years, when as a schoolboy, I tried to make one from a piece
of bent hazel wood. The inspiration for my effort was derived from a school
lesson which featured various weapons of Australian aborigines. I was so
intrigued by accounts of the boomerang that I decided to try and make one
for myself. Unfortunately. I had only an illustration of a boomerang to
work from. which gave no indication of size and thickness. or the fact
that it possessed a certain sectional shape. Furthermore, I didn't know
how a boomerang was thrown. Consequently, my attempts to get a piece of
bent hazelwood to fly and come back to me, were, to say the least, both
disappointing and unsuccessful. So I gave up the idea of trying to make
and throw a boomerang. The thought did cross my mind that perhaps boomerang
throwing was an art and skill known only to the aborigines and perhaps
there was something magical in the construction of a boomerang which made
it return. Of course I had no aborigine playmates who could let me into
the secrets of this "magical flying stick," and there were no books available
on the subject to which I could refer. So my interest in boomerangs died
there, or so I thought. Then a few years ago, after spending best part
of my early adult life as an enthusiastic archer, I set out to discover
if I could the secrets of the boomerang and how to throw it.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;I then spent several months searching
for information. For a start, I contacted friends with Australian connections
and searched the libraries for books on the subject. I then wrote to the
Librarian at Australia House in London who kindly supplied me with an assortment
of photo copies of articles on the subject. Sifting through these I came
across a great deal of useful information which included a short article
(author Unknown) on how to throw a boomerang. Finally, I arranged a visit
to the Ethnographical Department of the British Museum, where I was able
to view a selection of hunting weapons and boomerangs on display there.
My visit was arranged with the Asst. Keeper of the Ethnographical Department,
Mr. B. A. L. Cranstone. who in the meantime. had kindly and thoughtfully
selected from the Museum's Library several books which contained articles
and drawings relating to boomerangs. Like the articles from Australia House
Library. most of these were written during the latter part of the last
century. but never-the-less, contained useful information which I was able
to note down. and so increase my knowledge on the subject of boomerangs.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;My visit to the British Museum had
proved most rewarding, for I now had a very good idea of the actual size,
shape and thickness of the "Magic Stick." so, armed with this precious
information I set about making a replica in birch ply. My first model was
rather large and crude, but never-the-less. you can imagine my excitement
on dashing off to the local sports field to try it out, I threw it. and
to my utter astonishment it actually "flew" and came back on my first attempt.
I then spent several hours throwing, and was most reluctant to leave the
field. only doing so. when it became too dark and dangerous to continue.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;I have been making and throwing boomerangs
ever since. I have also taught dozens of others to do the same, and will
no doubt go on doing so for the rest of my days. Such is the fascination
of the boomerang for me.&nbsp;</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Long Distance defined be Herb</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><i>Another excerpt from Herbs book</i>:</font>
<h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Distance Booms and throwing them</font></h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the past so many contradictory articles
have been published regarding the distance an aborigine could throw a returning
boomerang, that the reader has the utmost difficulty in separating fact
from fiction.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;The majority of these articles appeared
in a variety of publications before the turn of the century, and were supposedly
from eyewitness accounts by early explorers of Australia. It would appear
from many reports that the observer was blessed with a vivid imagination.
and not adverse to a great deal of colourful exageration.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;One eye witness reports to have seen
an aborigine throw his returning boomerang nearly 200 yards and then waited
several minutes for its return "Whereupon it suddenly appeared and landed
with a thud, burying itself deeply into the hard ground a few paces from
the thrower." A highly dangerous practice, I would say.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;Others have attributed to the boomerang
almost supernatural powers by stating to have seen them "Climb heavenwards
to a height of several hundred feet and circle freely about the sky as
if unwilling to return to earth" and then, miraculously . . . "drop at
the throwers feet." Now these accounts of a boomerangs performance in the
hands of the aborigine would make exciting reading were they to be written
for a school boys comic or novel, but unfortunately, (with all due respects
to the aborigines skill) they are not altogether true. In the opinion of
many other more serious enthusiasts of the boomerang who have spent years
living amongst the aborigines and learning their culture and various skills.
The more accurate and less romantic accounts of the returning boomerangs
true performance, both in distance and flight duration have recorded it
as having an average outward range of 40 yards, with duration of flight
averaging 10 seconds. From my own limited experience and observations,
these latter figures are much more realistic.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;It is possible that some of the earlier
observers have somehow confused the returning boomerangs performance with
that of the non-returning hunting boomerangs which I understand, could
be thrown to greater distances, by throwing them, as the aborigines did,
across, and slightly down wind. If on the other hand, the writer was referring
to the overall flight distance of the returning boomerang, as being nearly
200 yards (and not the distance it travelled outwards) then this would
have been a very fair estimate for a boomerang, travelling as it does,
on a near circular orbit, particularly if the boomerang in question had
performed a series of "pendulum swings" or possibly, as some do, a second
smaller circle, before returning to the thrower. However, this explanation
doesn't answer the question of the long flight durations which one eyewitness
recorded in minutes.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;Possibly, from the point of view
of someone observing for the first time a boomerang in flight it would
appear to be airborne for a long time, performing its various manoeuvres
in the air, but this is only a "mental time illusion" and the observer
would probably be surprised to learn that he had just witnessed a flight
which could be timed in seconds only. Some of my own long distance boomerangs,
which have a flight path of approximately 300 yards, have been consistantly
timed in flight at only 10 - 12 seconds from the moment they leave the
hand to the time they return back to the throwing mark.&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>&nbsp;
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>&nbsp;
<h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Making boomerangs for distance throwing</font></h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Almost all the boomerangs available commercially
are of the type which have an outward range of between 15 and 35 yards.
It is rare to find one that will exceed the latter distance by more than
a dozen yards. These could be described as "short distance models'' as
also could the "Gem," "Sycamore" and "Traditional", which appear in Chapter
2. There are many present day claims for long distance throws of up to
100 yards, but it would seem that the type of boomerang used was of a design
and weight not available commercially, and further more, on closer investigation
many of these 100 yard claims were for outward distance only with only
partial return. With this fact in mind, I have included this final chapter
for the benefit of the enthusiast who is interested in making long distance
models, capable of reaching 100 yards or more and which will return completely
back to the throwing mark. I have personally proved this by making a world
record throw of 108 yards. This distance was achieved in the presence of
official witnesses at the Littlehampton Sports Field in Sussex, on 17th
June, 1972. Details and a flight plan of this record throw are shown on
the inside back cover. The throw is also featured in the Guinness Book
of Records. The boomerang used for this throw was a large birch ply "Gem"
shaped model, ballasted with several small metal weights (a technique which
I discovered after several months of experimental work, the details of
which have never before been published).&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><img SRC="recboom.jpg" height=103 width=203>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is the world record boom he used
in 1972. Distance: 108 Yards (=98.8m)</font></i>
<h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">My first distance attempts</font></h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">When I first started to make boomerangs a
few years ago, using birch ply as a basic material, I had difficulty in
reaching distances in excess of 40 yards. I did however, manage to improve
this range by making much heavier models from alloy and fibre glass, but
these were more difficult to shape and furthermore. required a great deal
of physical effort to throw successfully. I then hit upon the idea of ballasting
my original birch ply models with small metal weights in an endeavour to
increase their distance potential without appreciably increasing their
overall weight in the hand.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;My initial experiments with ballast
were carried out, by simply strapping thin discs of lead to the blades
of the boomerang, by means of adhesive tape, moving the discs to various
positions after each throw, and noting down their effect on the boomerangs
flight. I was quite amazed after a short time, to discover that it only
required a small amount of ballast, set at the right position on the blades,
to improve the boomerangs outward range by over 50 per cent, without affecting
its return ability. After more tests, and using heavier weights, I found
the best possible position for ballasting, was at a point on the blades,
approximately one inch from the tips and a small amount set at the "elbow"
to give a more horizontal return.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;The amount of lead ballast which
I used, depended on the original weight of the unballasted boomerang, but
generally. an amount of ballast equal in total weight to a quarter of the
weight of the boomerang was sufficient to more than double the boomerangs
outward distance. The boomerang I used for my world record. weighed six
ounces before ballasting. To this I added just a fraction over two ounces
of lead. which was divided into two equal amounts, and set permanently
into the blade tips. To do this. I formed the lead into cylinder shaped
plugs, each measuring 1/2 inch in diameter, drilled holes in both blade
tips and then gently tapped the plugs into position until they were flush
with the surface of the boomerang. This was a simple operation and is the
method I now use to ballast most of my distance boomerangs.</font>
<h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Positions for ballast and methods of weighting</font></h3>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The question now arises. How much ballast
should be added to a boomerang in order to gain the maximum distance, without
affecting its return qualities? The answer to this question is. to a certain
extent, a matter of trial and error. Heavy boomerangs wont require as much
ballast as lighter models of the same shape. However, as a simple guide,
a weight of ballast equal to one third of the boomerangs original weight,
should not be exceeded otherwise the boomerang will be "overweight" and
will not return successfully, unless thrown in a very strong wind, which
in any case will reduce its outward distance and thus defeat the object
of ballasting in the first place. Furthermore, should you get the boomerang
back, it will probably have climbed high in the air and return on a steep
downward flight path, which is both dangerous and undesirable.&nbsp;</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;Another question now comes to mind
regarding the shape of boomerang best suited to ballasting, (some shapes
are more successful than others). I have always found that the most successful
results are achieved with ballasted models of the "Gem'' and "Sycamore"
and other boomerangs with parallel blades. I have never had a great deal
of success with weighted versions of the ''Traditional" shape. Perhaps
there are aerodynamic reasons for this. However, like the aborigine, bless
him, I am blissfully ignorant of the reasons a boomerang will perform in
a certain way when changes are made to its balance, shape, section and
size (of which there are dozens of combinations). Nevertheless, by trial
and error, I have gained a useful working knowledge which has enabled me
to make successful returning boomerangs in numerous shapes and sizes. Furthermore,
I have also discovered a method of increasing a boomerang's range by weight
ballasting and am more than pleased to be able to pass on this knowledge
to other interested enthusiasts. I am also fully confident that the reader
of this modest little book will not only be in a position to make and throw
his own boomerangs successfully, but will no doubt be able to improve on
my own humble achievements.</font>
