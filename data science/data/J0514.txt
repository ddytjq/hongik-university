<h1>Crash kills driver, official at Toronto IndyCar event</h1>

TORONTO -- Adrian Fernandez won for the first time Sunday, but it was not a day for celebration on the IndyCar circuit as the Toronto Molson-Indy was marred by a crash that killed rookie driver Jeff Krosnoff and race-course worker Gary Avrin.<p>

<img SRC="0714jeff.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="128" HEIGHT="177">Dr. Hugh Scully, medical director for the race, said Krosnoff, a
31-year-old from La Canada, Calif., and Avrin, from Calgary, Alberta, were killed instantly in the incident that came during the 92nd lap of the scheduled 95-lap event.<p>

&quot;Effectively, both were killed instantly,&quot; Scully said. &quot;There
was no suffering on the part of either of them.&quot;<p>

Dr. Steve Olvey, medical director for Championship Auto Racing
Teams, which sanctions the PPG IndyCar World Series, was on the
scene quickly and made attempts to resuscitate Krosnoff, who never
regained consciousness. He was pronounced death at the Western
Division of Toronto Hospital at 4:20 p.m. ET, about 30 minutes
after the accident.<p>

Scully said Krosnoff died of &quot;massive head and chest
injuries, skeletal wounds and complete cardiac arrest.&quot; The Toronto coroner's office is investigating both deaths, and
details of Avrin's injuries are being withheld.<p>

Barbara Johnston of Ypsilanti, Mich., another course worker, was
treated and released for a lacerated head at St. Michael's
Hospital.<p>

Six others were killed Sunday in racing-related accidents in Europe.
Four people were killed and 23 injured
when a race car went out of control and flew into a crowd of
spectators in France, and a British rider and
Belgian official were killed in Belgium in the Francorchamps
24-hour motorcycle race.<p>

An unspecified number of spectators also were being treated for lacerations and other injuries caused by debris. <p>

Fernandez and Alex Zanardi were battling for the lead elsewhere on the track when Krosnoff made wheel-to-wheel contact with Stefan Johansson on the fastest part of the 1.784-mile, 11-turn temporary road circuit. <p>

Krosnoff's car went airborne, spinning and disintegrating as it repeatedly struck a retaining wall and fence that Avrin was standing near.  Krosnoff's legs were exposed as the cockpit came crashing to the ground and spun to a halt near the outside retaining wall. <p>

Avrin, 44, was stationed at the site of the accident, but it was not
immediately clear if he was hit by flying debis or the car itself. &quot;I know he died doing what he loved to do,&quot; Avrin's mother,
Ruth, told The Toronto Star. &quot;That's a comfort to me right now.&quot;<p>

Many in the crowd of 68,000, away from the crash site, had no
idea what happened.<p>

Johansson, Andre Ribeiro and Emerson Fittipaldi, all of whom
were involved in the incident, wound up parked in a runoff area at
the end of the Lakeshore Boulevard straightaway.<p>

&quot;I went to brake for Turn 3 and suddenly saw an engine and
transmission deposited in my right front suspension,&quot; Fittipaldi
said. &quot;It was from Krosnoff's car, which was upside down in the
barrier. ... The scene at Turn 3 was chaotic. It is very sad.&quot;<p>

As emergency personnel worked to extricate Krosnoff from his
car, officials waved the red and checkered flags, ending the race
at the end of the 93rd lap.<p>

&quot;Something like this brings you to earth right away,&quot; Zanardi
said. &quot;I can't complain about losing the race. This is nothing to
compared to what happened to Jeff Krosnoff.&quot;<p>

Krosnoff's wife, Tracy, and parents, Jack and Jeanne, were at
Toronto Hospital when he
was pronounced dead about 30 minutes after the accident.<p>

Krosnoff is the second driver killed an Indy-type car. Scott Brayton, racing in the Indy Racing League, died in a crash in May during Indianapolis 500 practice. The last
IndyCar driver killed during a race was Swede Savage in the 1973
Indy 500.<p>

Krosnoff joined Arciero-Wells Racing this year and had run in all 11 IndyCar events.  He came to IndyCar after competing in
Japanese Formula 3000 for five years. He also competed in
the 24 Hours of LeMans three times.<p> 

Krosnoff was one of three drivers currently piloting
Toyota-powered cars, as the Japanese automaker is in its first
year developing an IndyCar racing program.  Krosnoff had earned
no points in the IndyCar Rookie of the Year points standings.<p> 

Krosnoff is a 1987 graduate of UCLA, and lived in LaCanada,
Calif., with his wife, Tracy. <p>

Other Indy-car drivers killed in crashes during practice or qualifying since 1973 include Gordon Smiley at Indianapolis and Jim Hickman at Milwaukee in 1982 and Jovy Marcello at Indianapolis in 1994.<p>

A corner worker, Jean-Patrick Heine of Montreal, was killed when
he was hit by a race car at Vancouver in the inaugural IndyCar
event there in 1990.<p>

The crash occurred just beyond the finish line, and officials
halted the race before the drivers could approach the debris.
Fernandez was declared the winner, giving the 31-year-old Mexican his first IndyCar victory in 48 starts.  The best previous finish for Fernandez was third in the 1995 Michigan 500.<p> 

&quot;My prayers go out to the families and people involved in the
crash,&quot; Fernandez said. &quot;I'm happy to win the race, but this is a
very sad thing.&quot;<p>

Zanardi of Italy finished second, continuing his impressive
rookie campaign which has resulted in a victory and a pair of
runner-up finishes over the past three races.  Bobby Rahal
finished third followed by Canadians Greg Moore and Paul Tracy, Bryan Herta, Christian Fittipaldi and series leader Jimmy Vasser.<p>

Fernandez was in command at the time the race was flagged to a halt. Barring contact or mechanical failure, he would have rolled to an easy victory. <p>

Fernandez made a quick stop and was able to get back onto the
track in front of Zanardi, who had appeared to have the race well
in hand before stopping on lap 66.<p> 

&quot;I had to concentrate on catching (Zanardi) in the pit lane,&quot;
Fernandez said. &quot;The guys did a great job of getting me out before
him.&quot;<p>

When Moore finally pitted on lap 78, Fernandez was in front of
Zanardi's Reynard-Honda by 2.79 seconds.

The Italian rookie, who won this season at Portland, Ore., was
in hot pursuit of Fernandez when Michael Andretti stopped on
Lakeshore with an engine problem on lap 85, bringing the second
full-course caution of the race.<p>

The green flag waved again for the start of lap 90 with Zanardi
right behind Fernandez, who was able to make a strong start and
easily hold the lead. Fernandez still led Zanardi by 1.98 seconds
at the end of lap 91 and appeared to be holding his own before the
accident ended the race.<p>

&quot;The main problem was I picked up a puncture right at the end
in my left-rear tire,&quot; Zanardi said. &quot;I was losing some (air)
pressure, but not too much. Still, it was a problem on the restart
and it was tough to keep Bobby behind me.<p>

&quot;Adrian was very fast at the end and I was just trying to
defend my place. The only way I could have gotten past him was if
he had gotten caught behind traffic.&quot;<p>

Zanardi also drove a strong race, and will close to a
point of Moore in the IndyCar rookie points standings. <p>

Vasser will extend his lead in the IndyCar standings with
his seventh-place finish. With Al Unser Jr. and Brazilian Gil
de Ferran's chances poisoned during a sloppy race start, Vasser
all but was guaranteed to remain the points leader after the race.<p>

Unser and de Ferran were involved in contact at the start of the
race, and both drivers had to enter the pits after the first lap
to have the nose and front wings portions of their respective
racers repaired.  Unser came into the race trailing Vasser by
three points, and de Ferran was 10 behind the leader. <p>

Sunday marked the eighth victory for Honda after 11 races in the
IndyCar series. The Japanese manufacturer came to IndyCar in
1994 after a history of success in Formula One and several other
international racing series. <p>

Andretti, who won three races while serving a four-race
probation period for rough driving, was involved in incidents
with a pair of drivers. Andretti tapped Parker Johnstone early
in the race, causing Johnstone to spin, and later he tapped the rear of Roberto Moreno's racer. <p>

The next race on the IndyCar schedule is the Marlboro 500 at
Michigan International Speedway on July 28. <p>
