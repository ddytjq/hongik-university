      A simple and flexible way to control your finances by telephone and post.
      <p>Attractive variable interest rate -<STRONG> 4.00%</STRONG> gross p.a.<sup><font size="1">&#134;</font></sup>/AER* 
        (currently equivalent to 3.20% net p.a.<sup><font size="1">&#134;</font></sup>).</p>
      <p>Guaranteed interest rate - the gross p.a.<sup><font size="1">&#134;</font></sup>/AER* 
        is guaranteed to fall no lower than 0.25% below the Bank of England base 
        rate until 1st October 2003. <br>
        <br>
        Direct access to your money by phone and the LINK cash machine network.</p>
      <p>Interest is paid annually on 1st June.</p>
      <p>Interest can be added to your account (where it immediately starts earning 
        more interest), transferred to another Chelsea account or to your bank 
        account.</p>
      <p></p>
	  <STRONG><a name="Easycard"></a><span class="redtext">Easy access - with your 
        Chelsea Card</span></STRONG><br>
      You can use your Chelsea Card to withdraw up to &pound;200 per day from 
        any of the thousands of LINK cash machines in the UK (depending on your 
        account balance).
      <p>We make no charges for ATM transactions at other organisations' cash 
        machines.</p>
      <p>You can also use your Chelsea Card on some machines to check your account 
        balance.</p>
      <p>Your PIN number will be issued once we have processed your application, 
        however, you can change your PIN at any ATM owned by the Chelsea or those 
        owned by the following financial institutions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Derbyshire Building Society</li>
        <li>Dunfermaline Building Society</li>
        <li>Northern Rock plc</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
	  <STRONG><a name="Easytel"></a><span class="redtext">Easy access - with secure 
        telephone withdrawals</span></STRONG><br>
      You can transfer money into a nominated account simply by telephoning 
        us.
      <p>The <STRONG>minimum withdrawal using this service is &pound;250</STRONG> and it 
        usually takes three working days for the money to reach your nominated 
        account.</p>
      <p>When you open your account, we ask you to nominate a bank or building 
        society account (<STRONG>on which you must be named</STRONG>) to receive the funds 
        you instruct us to transfer using your telephone. </p>
      <p>We will also ask you to provide us with three passwords:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A name memorable to you</li>
        <li>A place memorable to you</li>
        <li>A memorable word</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Then, when you call the Call-Direct withdrawal line - <STRONG>0845 601 2710</STRONG> 
        (Monday-Thursday 8am-8pm, Friday 8am-6pm and Saturday 9am-5pm) - you will 
        be asked for a combination of the letters from your passwords to authorise 
        the withdrawal.</p>
      <p>For security reasons, if you fail to provide the correct combination 
        to match our records, the transaction will not be authorised. Following 
        three consecutive failures, a stop will be placed on your account, and 
        we will write to you requesting a new set of passwords. In the interim, 
        we will permit withdrawal requests on receipt of your original written 
        instructions.</p>
      <p>On joint accounts, the teleauthorisation service is only available provided 
        your instructions are for either party to authorise transactions - see 
        application form.<br>
      </p>
      <p></p>
	  <STRONG><a name="howmuch" class="redtext">How much can I invest?</a> </STRONG><br>
      You will need a minimum of &pound;2,500, and can only invest your own 
        money (you cannot invest money on behalf of someone else).
      <p>You can add to your investment, by post, up to a maximum of &pound;250,000 
        per investor (provided that your total investment in this and all other 
        Chelsea accounts does not exceed &pound;1 million). <br>
