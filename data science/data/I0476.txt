He is the first player to score 100 goals in the F.A. Premier League.  He began his career with Southampton.  In 1992 he was transferred to Blackburn for a record fee of £3.3 million.  In 1995, the club's investment paid dividends, as Alan led Blackburn to its first title in more than eighty years.  In four years with Blackburn he scored more than 120 goals.  Alan currently plays for Newcastle United.</P><BR><P>Six months ago he ruptured ankle ligaments and fractured his fibula against Chelsea in a tournament friendly.  As a result, England was forced to finish their qualifying matches without their prolific striker.</P></Left><BR><P><Center>"I'm a big believer that if things are going to happen they will happen.
