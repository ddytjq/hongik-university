Discovered 1610 by Nicholas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc.
<p>
Located at a distance of about 1,600 (or perhaps 1,500) light years, the 
Orion Nebula is the brightest diffuse nebula in the sky, visible to the 
naked eye, and rewarding in telescopes of every size, from the smallest 
glasses to the greatest Earth-bound observatories and the Hubble Space 
Telescope.
<p>
It is the main part of a 
<a href="../more/oricloud.html">much larger cloud of gas and dust</a> 
which extends over 10 degrees well over half the constellation Orion. 
The linear extend of this giant cloud is well several hundreds of light 
years.  It can be visualized by long exposure photos (see e.g. Burnham) 
and contains, besides the Orion nebula near its center, the following 
objects, often famous on their own:
<a href="../xtra/ngc/b-loop.html">Barnard's Loop</a>,
<a href="../xtra/ngc/b33reg.html">the Horsehead Nebula region</a> 
(also containing NGC 2024 = Orion B), 
and the reflection nebulae around <a href="m078.html">M78</a>.
Already impressive in deep visible light photographs, the Orion Cloud is 
particularly gorgeous in the 
<a href="../more/oric_iras.html">infrared light</a>.
<p>
The Orion Nebula itself is still a <i>big</i> object in the sky, extending 
some 66x60 arc minutes, thus covering four times the area of the full Moon.
This corresponds to a linear diameter of about 30 light years.
It is also one of the brightest Deep Sky objects, well visible to the naked
eye, so that the present author is wondering that its nebulous nature was 
apparently not documented before 1610, when 
<a href="../xtra/Bios/peiresc.html">Nicholas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc</a>
(1580-1637), a French lawyer, turned his telescope to this region of the sky
(although Ptolemy, as well as later Tycho Brahe and Johann Bayer had cataloged 
the brightest stars within it as one bright star - the latter cataloging it 
as Theta Orionis, and Galileo had detected a number of faint stars when
first looking at this region with his telescope earlier in 1610). 
It was independently rediscovered in 1611 by the Jesuit astronomer 
<a href="../xtra/Bios/cysatus.html">Johann Baptist Cysatus</a> (1588-1657) of 
Lucerne who compared it with a comet he had observed in the same year. 
The <a href="../more/m042_hodierna.html">first known drawing of the Orion 
nebula</a> was created by <a href="../xtra/similar/hodierna.html">Giovanni 
Batista Hodierna</a>.
All these discoveries apparently 
<a href="../more/m042_dis.html">got lost for some time</a>, so that eventually
<a href="../xtra/Bios/huygens.html">Christian Huygens</a> was longly credited 
for his independent rediscovery in 1656, e.g. by Charles Messier when he 
<a href="../xtra/history/m-cat.html#M42">added it to his catalog</a> 
on March 4, 1769.
<p>
As the drawings of the Orion Nebula known to him did so poorly represent
Messier's impression, he created a 
<a href="../xtra/history/m-m31_42.html">fine drawing</a> of this Object, in 
order to "help to recognize it again, provided that it is not subject to 
change with time" (as Messier states in the 
<a href="../xtra/history/m-cat-i.html">introduction to his catalog</a>).
<p>
This gorgeous object continued influence astronomers since. It was the first 
deepsky observation by <a href="../xtra/Bios/wherschel.html">William Herschel
</a> with a self-constructed reflecting telescope of 6-foot focal length in 
1774. In 1789, with some prophetic touch, he described his observations with 
his 48-inch aperture, 40-inch FL scope as 
"an unformed fiery mist, the chaotic material of future suns." 
In 1880, M42 was the first nebula to be successfully photographed, by 
Henry Draper.
<p>
The nebula, on its northern end, is devided by a conspicuous dark lane, well 
visible in our photograph. This image was obtained David Malin of the
<a href="http://www.aao.gov.au/">Anglo-Australian Observatory</a>. 
<a href="../more/m042_image.html">More information on this image</a>
is available.
<p>
The small northeastern portion was first reported by 
<a href="../xtra/Bios/demairan.html">de Mairan</a>, and was given 
an extra number by Charles Messier, <a href="m043.html">M43</a> (see below also). 
In the very neighborhood, to the north, there are also fainter reflection 
nebulae, partially reflecting the light of the Great Nebula. They were not 
notable for Charles Messier, but labeled later with the NGC numbers 1973-5-7. 
Here we have a collection of 
<a href="../more/m042-043_more.html">more images of M42, M43</a>, and
<a href="../more/m042-043_m2.html">more images of M42, M43 and NGC 1973-5-7</a>.
<p>
M42 itself is apparently a very turbulent cloud of gas and dust, full of 
interesting details, which C.R. O'Dell compares to the rich topography of the
Grand Canyon in his HST photo caption. 
The major features got names on their own by various
observers:  The dark nebula forming the lane separating M43 from the main 
nebula extends well into the latter, forming a feature generally nicknamed 
the "Fish's Mouth". The bright regions to both sides are called the "wings", 
while at the end of the Fish's Mouth there's a cluster of newly formed stars, 
called the "<i>Trapezium cluster</i>". The wing extension to the south on the 
east (lower left in our image) is called "The Sword", the bright nebulosity 
below the Trapezium "The Thrust" and the fainter western (right) extension 
"The Sail". Here we have a small collection of
<a href="../more/m042_more.html">Images of detail in M42</a>, including 
another nomenclature for the brightest region in the nebula by historic
visual observers, as well as a pictorial study of the
<a href="../more/m042_lo.html">
Trapezium cluster and region by Lowell Observatory images</a>.
<p>
The Trapezium cluster is among the very youngest clusters known, with new
stars still forming in this region. The cluster was first depicted as triple
star apparently by Hodierna before 1654 (see 
<a href="../more/m042_hodierna.html">his drawing</a>), and first described by 
Christian Huygens in 1656 when he indepedently rediscovered the Orion nebula.
These first three stars are often labelled "A", "B", and "C".
At this time, this was apparently the second recognized multiple star (after
Mizar in Ursa Major which had been found to be a telescopic double in 1650).
The fourth Trapezium star, "D", was first found by 
<a href="../xtra/Bios/picard.html">Abbe Jean Picard</a> 
(according to de Mairan), and independently by Huygens in 1684. 
The fifth cluster star "E" was discovered by Wilhelm Struve in 1826 with a 
9.5-inch refractor in Dorpat, the sixth, "F", by John Herschel  on 
February 13, 1830, the seventh, "G", by Alvan Clark in 1888 when testing his 
36-inch refractor of Lick Observatory, and the eighth, "H" by E.E. Barnard 
later in 1888 with the same telescope. 
Barnard later found that "H" is double, with two 16th-magnitude components.
Today we know that stars "A" and "B" are both eclipsing variables of Algol type:
A varies between magnitudes 6.73 and 7.53 with a period of 65.4325 days, while
B varies between mag 7.95 and 8.52 in 6.4705 days.
<p>
The Orion Nebula is also one of the easiest and most rewarding target
for <a href="../more/m042_m2.html">amateur astrophotographers</a>.
<p>
The past decades of research on the Orion Nebula have revealed that the 
visible nebula, M42, the blister of hot, photo-ionized, luminous gas around 
hot Trapezium stars, is only a thin layer lying on the surface of a much 
larger cloud of denser matter, the Orion Molecular Cloud 1 (OMC 1). 
We happen to see this structure approximately face-on. The idea for this model 
came originally from <a href="#muench1958">M&uuml;nch (1958)</a> and 
<a href="#wurm1961">Wurm (1961)</a> and fully elaborated by several authors 
around 1973-1974 (<a href="#zuckerman1973">Zuckerman (1973)</a>,
<a href="#balick">Balick <i>et.al.</i> (1974)</a>), soon supported by evidence,
and is still studied in detail, see e.g. <a href="#odell2001">O'Dell (2001)</a> 
for a recent review, and references cited therein. 
<a href="http://vis.sdsc.edu/">The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC)'s
VisLab</a> has created a <a href="http://vis.sdsc.edu/research/orion.html">
3-dimensional visualization of the Orion Nebula</a> based on this model
(<a href="../Pics/More/m42flythrought.jpg">see side-view model image of M42</a>).
<p>
The Orion nebula was, continuously since the 
<a href="../more/m042_oldhst.html">early times</a> before its 
refurbishment, a preferred target for the Hubble Space Telescope.
One major discovery was that of protoplanetary disks, the socalled 
"<i>Proplyds</i>" (planetary systems in formation) in these 
<a href="../more/m042_hst.html">HST images of M42</a> 
(these images were used for an 
<a href="ftp://ftp.seds.org/pub/anim/space/OrionAnim.mpg">animation</a> 
simulating the approach to a protostar 
<a href="ftp://ftp.seds.org/pub/anim/space/OrionAnim.txt">[caption]</a>).
<a href="../more/m042_hst2.html">HST images of November 1995</a>
have revealed further insight into the complicated process taking place in 
this "star factory". 
<a href="../more/m042_hst3.html">Hubble investigations of January 1997</a>
have revealed interesting interactions of the young hot Trapezium cluster
stars with the protoplanetary disks: Their violent radiation tends to destruct
the discs, so that the lower-mass stars forming here may loose the material 
needed to form planetary systems.
<p>
It is very easy to find the Orion Nebula, as it surrounds the Theta Orionis 
multiple star or cluster, seen to the naked eye in the middle of the sword 
of Orion. Already under fairly good conditions, the nebula itself can be 
glimpsed with the naked eye as a faint nebulosity around this star. 
<p>
It is somewhat unusual that the Orion Nebula has found its way into 
<a href="../xtra/history/m-cat.html">Messier's list</a> together with the 
bright star clusters <a href="m044.html">Praesepe M44</a> and the 
<a href="m045.html">Pleiades M45</a>; Charles Messier usually only 
included fainter objects which could be easily taken for comets.  But
in this one night of March 4, 1769, he determined the positions of these
wellknown objects, (to say it with Owen Gingerich)
`evidently adding these as "frosting" to bring the list to 45', for its 
first publication in the <i>Memoires de l'Academie</i> for 1771 
(published 1774). 
<a href="../m-q&a.html#why_M42-45">One may speculate why</a> he prefered a 
list of 45 entries over one with 41; a possible reason may be that he wanted 
to beat <a href="../xtra/history/lacaille.html">Lacaille's 1755 catalog</a>
of southern objects, which had 42 entries.
Messier measured an extra position for a smaller northeastern
portion, reported by de Mairan previously, which therefore has the extra 
Messier number: <a href="m043.html">M43</a>.
