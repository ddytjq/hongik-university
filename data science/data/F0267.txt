<tr class=table><td colspan=2 class=table><p>MONEY Turn $6 into $6000.00 in two weeks <br><br>HOW TO TURN SIX DOLLARS INTO SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS: <br>READING THIS COULD CHANGE YOUR LIFE! IT DOES WORK! <br>I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it. <br>A little while back, I was browsing through newsgroups, just like you are now, <br>and came across an article similar to this that said you could make <br>thousands of dollars within weeks with only an initial investment of $6.00! <br>So I thought, &quot;Yeah right, this must be a scam&quot;, but like most of us, <br>I was curious, so I kept reading. Anyway, it said that you send <br>$1.00 to each of the 6 names and addresses stated in the article. <br>You then place your own name and address in the bottom of the list at #6, <br>and post the article in at least 200 newsgroups. (There are thousands) <br>No catch, that was it. <br>So after thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, <br>I thought about trying it. I figured &quot;what have I got to lose except <br>6 stamps and $6.00, right?&quot; Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!?... <br>Within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! I was shocked! <br>I figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in. <br>In my first week, I made about $25.00. By the end of the second week I had <br>made a total of over $1,000.00! In the third week I had over $10,000.00 <br>and it's still growing. This is now my fourth week and I have <br>made a total of just over $42,000.00 and it's still coming in rapidly. <br>It's certainly worth $6.00, and 6 <br>stamps, I have spent more than that on the lottery!! <br>Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, WHY it works... <br>Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, <br>so you can get the information off of it as you need it. <br>I promise you that if you follow the directions exactly, that you <br>will start making more money than you thought possible by doing something so easy! <br>Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully! <br>(print it out or download it.) Follow the simple directions and <br>watch the money come in! It's easy. It's legal. And, your investment <br>is only $6.00 (Plus postage) <br>IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not <br>indecent; it is not illegal; and it is 99%no risk - it really works! <br>If all of the following instructions are adhered to, you will <br>receive extraordinary dividends. <br>PLEASE NOTE: Please follow these directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 <br>or more can be yours in 20 to 60 days. This program remains <br>successful because of the honesty and integrity of the participants. <br>Please continue its success by carefully adhering to the instructions. <br>You will now become part of the Mail Order business. In this business <br>your product is not solid and tangible, it's a service. You are in the <br>business of developing Mailing Lists. Many large corporations are <br>happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. However, the money made <br>from the mailing lists is secondary to the income which is made from <br>people like you and me asking to be included in that list. <br>Here are the 4 easy steps to success: <br>STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write <br>the following on each piece of paper &quot;PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST.&quot; <br>Now get 6 US $1.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH <br>of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the <br>envelope (to prevent thievery). Next, place one paper in each of the <br>6 envelopes and seal them. You should now have 6 sealed envelopes, <br>each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, your name and <br>address, and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is creating a service. <br>THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! <br>You are requesting a legitimate service and you are paying for it! <br>Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried <br>about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with <br>the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal. <br>Mail the 6 envelopes to the following <br>addresses: <br>#1) C. Truvillion Jr. <br>4004 Thames Ct. <br>Bakersfield, CA 93313 <br>#2) C. Bishop <br>1029 Lampton St. <br>Louisville, Ky, 40204 <br>#3) Angel N. Kinzie <br>2006 W. 200 N. <br>Peru, In 46970 <br>#4) Salvatore LoPresti <br>1735 Macopin Rd. <br>West Milford, NJ 07480 <br>#5) Eireann McGrath <br>Box 283 <br>Denver, Indiana 46926<br>#6) Bryan Wood<br>P.O. Box 171463<br>Arlington, TX 76003-1463 <br>STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, <br>move the other names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) <br>and add YOUR Name as number 6 on the list. <br>STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to <br>keep this article as close to original as possible. Now, post your <br>amended article to at least 200 newsgroups. (I think there are close <br>to 24,000 groups) All you need is 200, but remember, the more you <br>post, the more money you make! You won't get very much unless you post <br>like crazy. :) <br>This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts, <br>refer to Title 18 Sec. 1302 &amp; 1341 of the Postal lottery laws. <br>Keep a copy of these steps for yourself and, whenever you need money, <br>you can use it again, and again. PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains <br>successful because of the honesty and integrity of the participants and by <br>their carefully adhering to the directions. Look at it this way. <br>If you are of integrity, the program will continue and the <br>money that so many others have received will come your way. <br>NOTE: You may want to retain every name and <br>address sent to you, either on a computer or hard copy and keep the <br>notes people send you. This VERIFIES that you are truly providing a <br>service. (Also, it might be a good idea to wrap the $1 bill in dark paper <br>to reduce the risk of mail theft.) <br>So, as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed, <br>six members will be reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer <br>with one dollar each. Your name will move up the list geometrically <br>so that when your name reaches the #1 position you will be receiving <br>thousands of dollars in CASH!!! <br>What an opportunity for only $6.00 <br>($1.00 for each of the first six people listed above) Send it now, <br>add your own name to the list and you're in business! <br>---DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS------------ <br>Step 1) You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your own <br>posting. Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this letter and drag <br>your cursor to the bottom of this document, and select 'copy' from the <br>edit menu. This will copy the entire letter into the computer's memory. <br>Step 2) Open a blank 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top <br>of the blank page. From the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will paste <br>a copy of the letter into notepad so that you can add your name to the list. <br>Step 3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. <br>If you want to do your postings in different settings, you'll always <br>have this file to go back to. <br>Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and <br>try searching for various newsgroups (on-line forums, message <br>boards, chat sites, discussions.) <br>Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this <br>article as a new message by highlighting the text of this letter <br>and selecting paste from the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this <br>will be the header that everyone sees as they scroll through the list of <br>postings in a particular group, click the post message button. <br>You're done with your first one! Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All <br>you have to do is jump to different newsgroups and post away, <br>after you get the hang of it, it will take about 30 seconds for each <br>newsgroup! <br>**REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE! <br>BUTYOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200** That's it! You will begin receiving <br>money from around the world within days! You may eventually want to rent <br>a P.O.Box due to the large amount of mail you will receive. If you wish <br>to stay anonymous, you can invent a name to use, as long as the postman <br>will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT.** <br>Now, each of the 5 persons who just sent me $1.00 <br>make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each with my name at #5 and only 5 <br>persons respond to each of the original 5, that is another $25.00 for <br>me, now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts with my name at #4 and <br>only 5 replies each, I will bring in an additional $125.00! <br>Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my name at <br>#3 and only receive 5 replies each, I will make an additional $625.00! <br>OK, now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post a <br>MINIMUM 200 letters with my name at #2 and they each only receive 5 <br>replies, that just made me $3,125.00!!! Those 3,125 persons will all <br>deliver this message to 200 newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 <br>persons per 200 newsgroups react I will receive $15,625,00! With <br>an original investment of only $6.00! AMAZING! <br>When your name is no longer on the list, you just take the latest posting in the <br>newsgroups, and send out another $6.00 to names on the list, putting <br>your name at number 6 again. And start posting again. The thing to <br>remember is: do you realize that thousands of people all over the <br>world are joining the internet and reading these articles everyday?, <br>JUST LIKE YOU are now?! So, can you afford $6.00 and see if it <br>really works?? I think so... <br>People have said, &quot;what if the plan is played out and no one <br>sends you the money? So what! What are the chances of that happening <br>when there are tons of new honest users and new honest people <br>who are joining the internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing <br>to give it a try? Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, <br>with thousands of those joining the actual internet. <br>Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will really work . <br><br>I came  across someone who made over 62,000 dollars in 75 days by doing this.</p>
