	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#000099" SIZE="1">Nottingham Plumber and
		Sunday football manager Reg Atkinson applies to install the undersoil heating
		at the new Wembley Stadium. His application coincides with the dismissal of the
		England national team manager a mere 10 days before England are due to face
		Germany in a crucial World Cup qualifying match. England only need a draw to
		qualify, whereas Germany must win the match. </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1" COLOR="#000099">By a combination of errors
		and a case of mistaken identity Reg is given the England manager's job. Former
		Forest manager Ron Atkinson was the man the FA wanted. When Reg realises it's
		too late - and costly - for him to stand down and, despite efforts made by the
		bungling F.A. officials who appointed him to force him out, he is forced to
		lead an England side out at the old Wembley (in our story Wembley has yet to be
		demolished - this is probably going to turn out to be true!). I won't spoil the
		ending - you'll have to read it! Just click on the copy below to order through
