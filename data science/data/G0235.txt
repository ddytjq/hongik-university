Abstract
<p>
We analyse in detail the spectral properties of the active
nucleus of ESO 138 G1. We find that this nucleus lies in the heart
of a low luminosity elliptical, making it a particularly
interesting and rare object.
We have been able to model the continuous energy distribution
over the wavelength range ll3400-9700, by an old stellar population
which has reached at most a solar metallicity and contribute to
60% of the flux at l5870, together with a younger population at
age less than 1Gyr. After subtraction of the stellar population 
contribution, we have obtained the pure emission line spectrum
from the active nucleus. it displays a wide range of ionization species,
which for iron in particular goes from [Fe II] up to [Fe XI] and possibly 
[Fe XIV]. The main line ratios observed in ESO 138 G1 lead us
to classify this active nucleus as a Seyfert 2 nucleus. A detailed
analysis of the emission lines reveals that there exists in this object,
a stratification of the emitting gas clouds according to their density
and dominant ionization stage.
The width of the lines is observed to correlate with their critical density.
The N O abundance ratio in the gas is about three times larger than
the solar value: this result is consistent with the emitting gas beeing
intrinsic material at the center of an elliptical galaxy. Compared
to the other two active galaxies which are known so far to exhibit such a
high excitation line spectrum, IIIZw77 and Tol0109-383, ESO 138 G1
builds up a sequence of spectral properties which can be understood if
the mean electron density and the excitation of the gas clouds
decrease from IIZw77 to ESo 138 G1. As the spectral properties of
the nucleus in IIIZw77 appear to bridge it with radiogalaxies,
we might be seeing, along the sequence, ESO 138 G1 to Tol0109-383 to
IIIZw77 to radiogalaxies, an increasing efficiency of matter
accretion in systems with increasing mass, from dwarf to giant galaxies.
