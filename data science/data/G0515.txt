Discovered 1731 by British amateur astronomer John Bevis.
<p>
The Crab Nebula is the most famous and conspicuous known supernova remnant. 
<p>
<a href="../more/m001_sn.html">The supernova</a> was noted on July 4, 1054 A.D. 
by Chinese astronomers, and was about four times brighter than Venus, or about
mag -6. According to the records, it was visible in daylight for 23 days,
and 653 days to the naked eye in the night sky. 
It was probably also recorded by Anasazi Indian artists (in present-day 
Arizona and New Mexico), as findings in Navaho Canyon and White Mesa (both AZ)
as well as in the Chaco Canyon National Park (NM) indicate; 
there's a review of the research on the 
<a href="http://www.chaco.com/park/archaeology/nebula.html">
Chaco Canyon Anazasi art online</a>. 
In addition, Ralph R. Robbins of the University of Texas has found Mimbres
Indian art from New Mexico, possibly depicting the supernova.
<p>
The Supernova 1054 was also assigned the variable star designation CM Tauri. It 
is one of few <a href="../more/mw_sn.html">historically observed supernovae</a>
in our <a href="../more/mw.html">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.
<p>
The nebulous remnant was discovered by <a href="../xtra/Bios/bevis.html">
John Bevis</a> in 1731, who <a href="../more/m001_bevis.html">added it</a>
to his sky atlas, <i>Uranographia Britannica</i>.
<a href="../xtra/history/biograph.html">Charles Messier</a> independently 
found it on August 28, 1758, when he was looking for comet Halley on its first 
predicted return, and first thought it was a comet. Of course, he soon 
recognized that it had no apparent proper motion, and 
<a href="../xtra/history/m-cat.html#M1">cataloged it</a> on September 12, 
1758. It was the discovery of this object which caused Charles Messier to 
begin with the compilation of <a href="../xtra/history/m-cat.html">his 
catalog</a>.
It was also the discovery of this object, which closely resembled a comet 
(1758 De la Nux, C/1758 K1) in his small refracting telescope, which brought
him to the idea to search for comets with telescopes (see his
<a href="../xtra/history/notes-c.html#1801note">note</a>).
Messier acknowledged the prior, original discovery by Bevis when he learned 
of it in a letter of June 10, 1771.
<p>
Although Messier's catalog was primarily compiled for preventing confusion of 
these objects with comets, M1 was again confused with comet Halley on the 
occasion of that comet's second predicted return in 1835.
<p>
This nebula was christened the "Crab Nebula" on the ground of a 
<a href="../more/m001_rosse.html">drawing made by Lord Rosse</a> about 1844. 
Of the early observers, Messier, Bode and William Herschel correctly remarked
that this nebula is not resolvable into stars, but William Herschel thought 
that it was a stellar system which should be resolvable by larger telescopes.
John Herschel and Lord Rosse, erroneously, thought it is "barely resolvable" 
into stars. They and others, including Lassell in the 1850s, apparently mistook 
filamentary structures as indication for resolvability.
<p>
Early spectroscopic observations, e.g. by Winlock, revealed the gaseous nature
of this object in the later 19th century.
The first photo of M1 was obtained in 1892 with a 20-inch telescope. First 
serious investigations of its spectrum were performed in 1913-15 by Vesto 
Slipher; he found that the spectral emission lines were split; it was later 
recognised that the true reason for this is Doppler shift, as parts of the
nebula are approaching us (thus their lines are blueshifted) and others 
receding from us (lines redshifted). Curtis, in his 
<a href="../Mdes/dm001.html#curtis">description</a> of this object based on 
Lick Observatory photographs, tentatively classified it as a planetary nebula
(<a href="#curtis1918">Curtis 1918</a>), a view which was disproved only in
1933.
<p>
In 1921, C.O. Lampland of Lowell Observatory, when comparing excellent 
photographs of the nebula obtained with their 42-inch reflector, found notable 
motions and changes, also in brightness, of individual components of the 
nebula, including dramatic changes of some patches near the central pair 
of stars (<a href="#lampland21">Lampland 1921</a>). 
The same year, J.C. Duncan of Mt. Wilson Observatory compared photographic 
plates taken 11.5 years apart, and found that the Crab Nebula was expanding
at an average of about 0.2" per year; backtracing of this motion showed that 
this expansion must have begun about 900 years ago
(<a href="#duncan21">Duncan 1921</a>).
Also the same year, Knut Lundmark noted the proximity of the nebula to the 
1054 supernova (<a href="#lundmark21">Lundmark 1921</a>).
<p>
In 1942, based on investigations with the 100-inch Hooker telescope on 
Mt. Wilson, Walter Baade computed a more acurate figure of 760 years age from 
the expansion, which yields a starting date around 1180 
(<a href="#baade1942">Baade 1942</a>); later investigations improved this value 
to about 1140. The actual 1054 occurrance of the supernova shows that the 
expansion must have been accelerated.
<p>
The nebula consists of the material ejected in the supernova explosion, 
which has been spread over a volume approximately 10 light years in diameter,
and is still expanding at the very high velocity of about 1,800 km/sec. 
It emits light which consists of two major contributions, first found by 
Roscoe Frank Sanford in 1919 by spectroscopic investigations, see 
(<a href="#sanford1919">Sanford 1919</a>), photographically confirmed 
by Walter Baade and Rudolph Minkowski in 1930: First, a reddish component 
which forms a chaotic web of bright filaments, which has an emission 
line spectrum (including hydrogene lines) like that of diffuse gaseous (or 
planetary) nebulae. 
Second a blueish diffuse background which has a continuous spectrum and 
consists of <a href="../more/m001_palo.html#m1_crab_pol">highly polarised</a> 
`<i>synchrotron radiation</i>', which is emitted by high-energy (fast moving) 
electrons in a strong magnetic field, an explanation first proposed by the
soviet astronomer <a href="#shklovsky1953">J. Shklovsky (1953)</a> and 
supported by observations of <a href="#oort1956">Jan H. Oort and T. Walraven
(1956)</a>. 
Synchrotron radiation is also apparent in other "explosive" processes in the 
cosmos, e.g. in the active core of the irregular galaxy 
<a href="m082.html">M82</a> and the peculiar jet of giant elliptical galaxy
<a href="m087.html">M87</a>. These striking properties of the Crab Nebula
in the visible light are equally conspicuous in the
<a href="../more/m001_palo.html">Palomar images</a> post-processed by
<a href="http://www.aao.gov.au/images/general/malin.html">David Malin</a> 
of the <a href="http://www.aao.gov.au/">Anglo Australian Observatory</a>,
and in <a href="http://tycho.la.asu.edu/scowen.html">Paul Scowen</a>'s
<a href="../more/m001_p2.html">image obtained on Mt. Palomar</a>.
<p>
In 1948, the Crab nebula was identified as a strong source of radio radiation,
named and listed as Taurus A and later as 3C 144.
X-rays from this object were detected in April 1963 with a high-altitude rocket
of type Aerobee with an X-ray detector developed at the Naval Research 
Laboratory; the X-ray source was named Taurus X-1. Measurements during lunar 
occultations of the Crab Nebula on July 5, 1964, and repeated in 1974 and 1975,
demonstrated that the X-rays come from a region at least 2 arc minutes in size, 
and the energy emitted in X-rays by the Crab nebula is about 100 times more than 
that emitted in the visual light. 
Nevertheless, even the luminosity of the nebula in the visible light is enormous: 
At its distance of 6,300 light years (which is quite well-determined, by
Virginia Trimble in 1974), its apparent brightness corresponds to an absolute 
magnitude of about -3.2, or more than 1000 solar luminosities. Its overall 
luminosity in all spectral ranges was estimated at 100,000 solar luminosities or 
5*10^38 erg/s !
<p>
On November 9, 1968, a pulsating radio source, the Crab Pulsar (also cataloged 
as NP0532, "NP" for NRAO Pulsar, or PSR 0531+21), was discovered in M1 by 
astronomers of the Arecibo Observatory 300-meter radio telescope in Puerto Rico. 
This star is the right (south-western) one of the pair visible near the 
center of the nebula in our photo. This pulsar was the first one which was also
verified in the optical part of the spectrum, when W.J. Cocke, M.J. Disney and 
D.J. Taylor of Steward Observatory, Tucson, Arizona found it flashing at the 
same period of 33.085 milliseconds as the radio pulsar with the 90-cm (36-inch)
telescope on Kitt peak; this discovery happened on January 15, 1969 at 9:30 pm 
local time (January 16, 1969, 3:30 UT, according to Simon Mitton). This optical 
pulsar is sometimes also referred to by the supernova's variable star 
designation, CM Tauri.
<p>
It has now been established that this pulsar is a rapidly rotating neutron 
star: It rotates about 30 times per second! This period is very well 
investigated because the neutron star emits pulses in virtually every part of 
the electromagnetic spectrum, from a "hot spot" on its surface. The neutron 
star is an extremely dense object, denser than an atomic nucleus, concentrating
more than one solar mass in a volume of 30 kilometers across. Its rotation
is slowly decelerating by magnetic interaction with the nebula; this is now a 
major energy source which makes the nebula shining; as stated above, this 
energy source is 100,000 times more energetic than our sun.
<p>
In the visible light, the pulsar is of 16th apparent magnitude. This means that 
this very small star is roughly of absolute magnitude +4.5, or about the same 
luminosity as our sun in the visible part of the spectrum !
<p>
<a href="mailto:jjh@cygloop.la.asu.edu">Jeff Hester</a> and 
<a href="http://tycho.la.asu.edu/scowen.html">Paul Scowen</a> have used 
the <a href="../xtra/hubble.html">Hubble Space Telescope</a> to 
<a href="../more/m001_hst.html">investigate the Crab Nebula M1</a>
(see also e.g. <i>Sky &amp; Telescope</i> of January, 1995, p. 40).
Their continuous investigations with the HST have provided new insight into the 
<a href="../more/m001_h2.html">dynamic and changes of the Crab nebula and 
pulsar</a>.
More recently, <a href="../more/m001_h3.html">the Heart of the Crab</a>
was investigated by HST astronomers.
<p>
This object has attracted so much interest that
it was remarked that astronomers can be devided into two fractions of about 
same size: Those who do work related to the Crab nebula, and those who don't.
There was a "Crab Nebula Symposium" in Flagstaff, Arizona in June, 1969
(see PASP Vol. 82, May 1970 for results - Burnham).
The IAU symposium No. 46, held at Jodrell Bank (England) in August 1970 was
solely devoted to this object. 
<a href="#mitton1978"><i>Simon Mitton</i></a> has written a nice book 
on the Crab Nebula M1 in 1978, which is still most readable and informative
(it is also source for some of the informations here).
<p>
The Crab Nebula can be found quite easily from Zeta Tauri (or 123 Tauri), the 
"Southern Horn" of the Bull, a 3rd-magnitude star which can be easily found
ENE of Aldebaran (Alpha Tauri). M1 is about 1 deg N and 1 deg W of Zeta, just
slightly south and about 1/2 degree west of a mag-6 star, Struve 742. 
<p>
The nebula can be easily seen under clear dark skies, but can equally easily 
get lost in the background illumination under less favorable conditions. 
M1 is just visible as a dim patch in 7x50 or 10x50 binoculars. With a little 
more magnification, it is seen as a nebulous oval patch, surrounded by haze. 
In telescopes starting with 4-inch aperture, some detail in its shape becomes 
apparent, with some suggestion of mottled or streak structure in the inner 
part of the nebula. The amateur can verify Messier's impression that M1 looks 
indeed similar to a faint comet without tail in smaller instruments. 
Only under excellent conditions and with larger telescopes, starting at about 
16 inches aperture, suggestions of the filaments and fine structure may 
become visible.
<p>
M1 is situated in a nice Milky Way field.
The star Zeta Tauri is remarkable as it is a Gamma Cassiopeiae type variable, 
a rather rapidly rotating star of spectral type B4 III pe which has 
ejected an expanding gas shell, and has a fainter spectroscopic companion 
star in an orbit of about 133 days period. 
Preceding M1 two minutes (or half a degree) in Right Ascension is Struve 742 or
ADS 4200, another visual binary star with components A (mag 7.2, spectrum F8, 
of yellow color) and B (mag 7.8, white) separated by about 3.6" in position 
angle 272deg, and orbiting each other in about 3000 years.
