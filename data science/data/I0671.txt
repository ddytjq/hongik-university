<A NAME="ifr"></A><H3>About International Football Results 1872-present</H3>

<P>The International Football Results website was started in 1996 when I set out to share the many football results I had collected over the years.
My football archive, which is the basis for creating the web pages, was actually started way back in 1988 because I wanted to know the historic
match results of nations that were participating in international tournaments. Although I had been a football fan since I was 7 years old, it was
international football which really inspired me because by watching international matches I was seeing the best players in the world playing
against each other. I was first inspired by the <A HREF="/football/wc/wc1982.html"><B>1982</B></A> and 
<A HREF="/football/wc/wc1986.html"><B>1986</B></A> World Cups (in my opinion these tournaments were two of the best ever), and then
by the <A HREF="/football/ec/ec1988.html"><B>1988</B></A> European Championship. The tournament itself was not one of the greatest, but as it was
my own country that ended up the winner, it was a tournament that I will never forget, ... every time I watch that volley from Marco van Basten I
still get goosebumps all over... (I guess you have to be Dutch...). I guess Argentinians will know what I am talking about with that Maradona goal
against England in 1986, or Brazilians with that goal from Socrates in 1986 after a nice one-two with Zico. For me though, Marco's goal just tops
them all because it was so unexpected and just hit you right between the eyes, and it came against Dasayev who was being reported at the time as
the best goalkeeper in the world.

<P>Anyway, I started by collecting match results that were readily available, such as from World Cups and European Championships. As I was also
really into computers at that time, I wrote some database programs to store and search through the results. With the help of books, magazines,
newspapers and television my archive soon started growing, but it was not until the mid 90's that the archive really started growing. Since then
it has gone from strength to strength and with the growth of the internet and with the kindness and dedication of many contributors, it has grown
to contain well over 24000 results. The web pages that you see on the site are generated semi-automatically from the archive with the help of many
specialised programs that I've had to write, and a lot of work goes on behind the scenes to make sure that the site has a consistent look and feel,
which is very important to me.

<P>As you can imagine the web site keeps me quite busy and I make updates to it almost every day because I want visitors to be able to rely on it,
and I hate web sites that are out-of-date, even by a few days. Unfortunately as I spend so much time collecting results and working on historical
aspects on my archive I don't often have time to improve my site (other than making available new results ofcourse), but I hope over time it will
get better and better. From time I will make improvements, and my next major improvement will be on making available the half-time scores that I
have always collected, but have never so far published. After that I will concentrate on making available interactive search facilities, such as
those available on other web sites. In the meantime, the site will continue to bring you international results as it has done for the past five
years, and I sincerely hope that you will continue to enjoy it.

<P>Football is a world game and although information from the world's major championships is easy to get hold of, there are going to be matches
played in certain parts of the world, details of which are not going to be easy to get hold of. I get information from many, many sources
including books, magazines, T.V., newspapers, and ofcourse the internet. These sources I almost take for granted as it is their job to report the
news, even if they don't necessarily need to make this information freely available. However, the general public have made incredibly valuable
contributions to my web site and it is therefore that I would like to thank and name the following people for making contributions to this web
site:

<UL>
<LI><B>John Louwerse</B>, who is absolutely incredible at finding those tough-to-find results</LI>
<LI><B>Mohammed Qayed</B>, whose site, <A HREF="http://www.arab-football.com" TARGET="_top"><B>www.arab-football.com</B></A> (mysteriously disappeared
last month) covers the Arab world like no other</LI>
<LI>People like <B>Alain Kit</B>, <B>Ron Kessler</B>, <B>Russell Gerard</B>, <B>Michael Cameron</B>, <B>Daniel Canas</B>, <B>Teo Yong Chye</B>,
and many others..., sorry, I can't remember all your names... but you know who you are...</LI>
<LI>And last but by no means least, two valuable contacts at <B>FIFA</B> who have been extremely supportive of my web site</LI>
</UL>

<P>Finally, I would like to thank my wife who has supported me and put up with many late nights working on my archive and my web site.
