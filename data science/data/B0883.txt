                <p>We can offer information on one product if you have already 
                  made up your mind, however, if you have not yet decided which 
                  of our mortgage products you wish to take, the Society will 
                  be pleased to offer you <b>advice and make a recommendation</b> 
                  as to the best mortgage product for you. If you do not require 
                  advice and a recommendation, we will be pleased to offer you 
                  information only on our mortgage products.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MAIN MORTGAGE REPAYMENT METHODS WHICH WE CAN OFFER<br>
                  <br>
                  </b>1. <b>Repayment Mortgage</b> - Capital and Interest Payments 
                  made to the Society<br>
                  <br>
                  Each month you make a payment to us consisting of capital and 
                  interest. During the early years most of the monthly payment 
                  consists of interest and it is only later on during your mortgage 
                  term that you pay back most of the capital balance. There is 
                  no life assurance arranged with this type of mortgage. It is 
                  strongly recommended, therefore, that you take separate life 
                  assurance cover so that the mortgage is paid off should you 
                  die during the mortgage term.<br>
                  <br>
                  2. <b>Interest Only</b></p>
                <p>The monthly payment you make to the Society consists of interest 
                  only. You choose the repayment vehicle, eg. Endowment policy, 
                  ISA, Pension or other form of investment, as long as it provides 
                  you with the means to repay the full mortgage balance at the 
                  end of the mortgage term. If you do not make a suitable arrangement 
                  to pay off your mortgage at the end of the mortgage term you 
                  will have to pay interest until the loan is repaid in full. 
                  It is your responsibility to check annually that there is an 
                  adequate repayment vehicle in place. In the event that the repayment 
                  vehicle is not adequate to repay your loan in full at the end 
                  of the mortgage term, you will be responsible for paying interest 
                  on this loan until it is fully repaid to the Society.<br>
                  <br>
                  There is no life assurance cover arranged with this type of 
                  mortgage and you are therefore advised to arrange separate life 
                  assurance cover so that the mortgage is paid off should you 
                  die during the mortgage term.<br>

                  3. <b>MORTGAGE PRODUCT INFORMATION AND TYPES OF INTEREST RATES 
                  AVAILABLE EXPLAINED</b><br>
                  <br>
                  <font color="#FF0000">I)</font> <b>Variable Rate Mortgages</b><br>
                  <br>
                  Variable rate mortgages are the most common type of loan. The 
                  rate of interest that you pay goes up and down during the lifetime 
                  of your mortgage, broadly in line with interest rates in the 
                  economy as a whole. When the interest rate goes up, the amount 
                  that you have to pay also rises, and falls when interest rates 
                  come down.<br>
                  <br>
                  <font color="#FF0000">ii)</font> <b>Discounted Rate</b><br>
                  <br>
                  This is a discount off the interest rate normally charged to 
                  borrowers, for a limited period at the start of the mortgage. 
                  The interest rate chargeable on the mortgage account is variable, 
                  even during the discount period. After the discount period has 
                  expired the interest rate will revert to the normal Standard 
                  Variable Rate of Interest.<br>
                  <br>
                  <font color="#FF0000">iii)</font> <b>Tracker</b><br>
                  <br>
                  A Tracker rate is linked to the Bank of England's Base Rate 
                  and will usually move within one month of a Bank Base Rate change.</p>
                <p><font color="#FF0000">iv)</font> <b>Fixed Rate</b><br>
                  <br>
                  A fixed rate loan gives a guaranteed rate of interest for an 
                  agreed period of time. This can be very comforting if you have 
                  a larger loan or a tight budget, because it guarantees that 
                  the payments won't rise. If interest rates fall mortgage payments 
                  remain the same.<br>
                  <br>
                  If you're interested in a fixed rate mortgage you should think 
                  carefully about how long you want to be locked into the fixed 
                  rate.<br>
                  <br>
                  When the fixed period ends the mortgage will revert to the Standard 
                  Variable Rate of Interest.</p>
                <p><font color="#FF0000">v)</font> <b>Capped Rate<br>
                  <br>
                  </b>This is a variable interest rate. The interest rate will 
                  not exceed a specified rate during the period that the &quot;cap&quot; 
                  is in place. At the end of the capped rate period, the interest 
                  rate would revert to the Standard Variable Rate of Interest.</p>
                <p><font color="#FF0000">vi)</font> <b>End of fixed term Special 
                  Schemes<br>
                  <br>
                  </b>At the end of any fixed rate or discounted rate period, 
                  the mortgage interest rate will revert to the Society's Standard 
                  Variable Rate of Interest. Your mortgage illustration will tell 
                  you what the monthly payment will be at the end of the discounted 
                  or fixed rate period at the Society's prevailing basic rate 
                  of interest</p>
                <p><font color="#FF0000">vii)</font> <b>Flexible Mortgage</b><br>
                  <br>
                  This type of mortgage offers facilities for changing mortgage 
                  payments in line with financial circumstances, the option to 
                  take payment holidays and to increase borrowing with the minimum 
                  of formality. Interest is calculated on a daily basis on the 
                  Society's Flexible Mortgage scheme.<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  4. <b>EARLY REPAYMENT OF A MORTGAGE, EARLY SURRENDER OF AN INVESTMENT 
                  PRODUCT, OR CHANGES IN YOUR PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES</b><br>
                  <br>
                  You must remember that if you redeem your mortgage early or 
                  make an early surrender of an investment product, this can adversely 
                  affect your financial situation depending on the type of mortgage 
                  or investment product that you have. Similarly you must remember 
                  that unexpected changes in your circumstances, for example redundancy, 
                  long term illness or relationship breakdown could mean that 
                  you have to redeem your mortgage early resulting in the application 
                  of early repayment charges.</p>
                <p>Although Mortgage Payment Protection Insurance is available 
                  should you wish to cover your payments in the event of sickness, 
                  accident or unemployment, it is important to remember that this 
                  will not cover relationship breakdown which could cause you 
                  financial problems, and may mean that you are unable to make 
                  your mortgage payments. In the event of financial difficulty 
                  or hardship arising from unexpected changes in circumstances, 
                  we will act sympathetically and work with you to find a positive 
                  solution. In the unfortunate event of death of a borrower, consideration 
                  is usually given to waiving any early repayment charges although 
                  the Society is not under a legal obligation to do so.<br>
                  <br>
                  5. <b>MORTGAGE TERM AND ESTIMATED RETIREMENT AGE<br>
                  <br>
                  </b>The usual maximum mortgage term allowable is up to 25 years.<br>
                  <br>
                  In view of the changes which occur to people's financial arrangements 
                  when they retire, the mortgage term which you select should 
                  not normally go beyond your anticipated retirement date.<br>
                  <br>
                  If you do request a mortgage term which will mean that the mortgage 
                  will still be running when you retire, the Society can only 
                  assess your financial arrangements at the time of the application, 
                  and the Society is not in a position to check the future adequacy 
                  of your pension arrangements. It is therefore your responsibility 
                  to check at the time of your application and during the term 
                  of your mortgage, that you have and will continue to have adequate 
                  income from which to meet your commitments on this mortgage 
                  and any other financial commitments you may have.<br>
                  <br>
                  6. <b>PORTABILITY<br>
                  <br>
                  </b>Most of the Society's mortgages can be continued if you 
                  move house in England or Wales. You must refer to the Key Features 
                  of your chosen mortgage product to ascertain whether the particular 
                  mortgage you chose can be ported. Portability is dependent on 
                  the specific terms available at the time you move house.<br>
                  <br>
                  7. <b>PROPERTY INSURANCE<br>
                  <br>
                  </b>Property Insurance is always required and it is your responsibility 
                  to keep the property fully insured at all times.<br>

                  We can help you to arrange Property Insurance with Royal &amp; 
                  SunAlliance PLC. The Royal &amp; SunAlliance PLC is a member

                  </b>We can help you to arrange Mortgage Payment Protection insurance 
                  with Royal &amp; SunAlliance PLC to provide cover for your monthly 
                  payments in the event of sickness, accident or unemployment.

                  9. <b>TARIFF OF MORTGAGE CHARGES<br>
                  <br>
                  </b>We have given you our current Tariff of Mortgage Charges 
                  which shows other costs which may apply during the application 
                  process and during the life of the mortgage. If there are any 
                  changes to any of these charges, you will be given a new tariff 
                  at least one month before the changes take effect.<br>
                  <br>
                  During the processing of your application, other costs can arise 
                  which may not have been referred to in the tariff or in product 
                  literature.<br>
                  <br>
                  Although this is not an exhaustive list other costs can include 
                  payment of a reference fee to your existing lender particularly 
                  if you are unable to provide your existing mortgage statements.<br>
                  <br>
                  You will have to pay the legal fees of transferring the property 
                  and registering it into your name, arranging the mortgage or 
                  transferring the mortgage from another lender and, in addition, 
                  there may be other unexpected legal costs if there are any problems 
                  with the transferring or correcting of the title to your property 
                  or in obtaining any planning consents or building regulation 
                  approval for alterations. If additional inspections of your 
                  property are necessary this will be referred to in any mortgage 
                  offer and may involve an additional reinspection fee as shown 
                  in the Tariff of Charges.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Stamp Duty<br>
                  <br>
                  </b>If you are buying a property with a purchase price of &pound;60,000 
                  or greater, you will have to pay stamp duty at the following 
                  rates, applicable in the tax year 2001/2002:-<br>
                  <br>
                  &pound;60,000 - &pound;250,000 - 1% of the purchase price<br>
                  &pound;250,000 - &pound;500,000 - 3% of the purchase price<br>
                  Over &pound;500,000 - 4% of the purchase price<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Further Advance Applications<br>
                  <br>
                  </b>These are considered for a variety of purposes and in some 
                  cases they qualify for special mortgage schemes which have a 
                  free application fee. Most types of further advance applications 
                  require additional legal work to be undertaken by the Society 
                  for which there will be an additional administrative fee of 
                  &pound;50. If it is necessary for your own Solicitor to become 
                  involved in the setting up of a Deed of Further Charge, you 
                  will be responsible for all costs incurred by your Solicitor.<br>
                  <br>
                  10. <b>CAPITAL REPAYMENTS<br>
                  <br>
                  </b>A capital repayment is a payment of at least &pound;500 
                  (or such other amount as we may specify in the future) which 
                  can be paid to the Society in addition to the monthly payment 
                  and any other amounts due and payable under the conditions of 
                  the mortgage. A capital repayment can be made at any time but 
                  if it is made during the period of a special mortgage scheme, 
                  then early repayment charges will also be payable as set out 
                  in your mortgage offer. After making a capital repayment you 
                  can ask the Society to recalculate your normal monthly payments 
                  or you can leave the payments as they are which will have the 
                  effect of reducing the remaining mortgage term.<br>
                  <br>
                  11. <b>EARLY REPAYMENT CHARGES</b></p>
                <p>Early repayment charges are made by the Society which specifically 
                  relate to the special schemes eg fixed, discounted, cashback 
                  or capped mortgages. The early repayment charges will be set 
                  out in your mortgage offer. The Society also has a redemption 
                  charge during the life of the mortgage which is shown in the 
                  enclosed Tariff of Mortgage Charges and which will be explained 
                  to you by the customer adviser.<br>
                  <br>
                  12. <b>ADDITIONAL MORTGAGE SECURITY FEE (DOMESTIC MORTGAGE INDEMNITY 
                  - DMI)<br>
                  <br>
                  </b>This is paid by the Society. It means that if the amount 
                  you are borrowing is more than the maximum loan we would normally 
                  make on the property (ie 80% of the property's valuation or 
                  purchase price, whichever is the lower), a higher lending fee 
                  (or additional mortgage security fee) will usually be paid to 
                  an insurance company. This is an indemnity insurance for us 
                  and will not protect you. If we do purchase an indemnity insurance 
                  this in no way affects your liability and your promise to repay 
                  all monies owing including any arrears, interest and legal fees. 
                  We may claim on the insurance company in the event that the 
                  property is taken into possession and sold by us for less than 
                  the amount you owe. However, the insurance company has the right 
                  to recover from you any monies paid to us under the indemnity 
                  insurance. We can also seek to recover on our own behalf or 
                  on behalf of the insurers all the money that you owe us at the 
                  same time as recovering the balance of our loss which was not 
                  covered by the indemnity insurance.<br>

                  </b>If you find yourself in financial difficulties you should 
                  let us know as soon as possible. The Society will do everything 
                  they can to help you during your period of difficulty. The Society 
                  follows the Council of Mortgage Lenders Statement of Practice 
                  on handling arrears and possessions and will also, with your 
                  request and consent, liaise with Debt Counselling Organisations, 
                  for example, Citizens Advice Bureau, Money Advice Centres or

                  <b>Borrowers receiving mortgage interest assistance from the 
                  Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)<br>
                  <br>
                  </b>If you are receiving assistance from the D.W.P. with your 
                  mortgage payments you should be aware of the following points.<br>
                  <br>
                  The D.W.P. pays interest at a standard rate which is determined 
                  by the Government. This rate of interest may not be the same 
                  as the rate of interest charged to your account by us. As this 
                  may result in a shortfall between the amount charged and the 
                  amount payable by the D.W.P., you must be careful to ensure 
                  that this shortfall is made up on your mortgage account. You 
                  must advise the D.W.P. of all interest rate changes on your 
                  mortgage account which we notify to you. This will help to ensure 
                  that your mortgage interest is not overpaid by the D.W.P. and 
                  that overpayments are not claimed back from you. You should 
                  check that the D.W.P. pay you the correct amount, however, they 
                  will not normally pay interest on arrears.<br>
                  <br>
                  The D.W.P. will not pay for Endowment Policy premiums, capital 
                  repayments or Property Insurance premiums. Please speak to us 
                  about these payments.<br>
                  <br>
                  You should advise the D.W.P. if you receive payments from a 
                  Mortgage Payment Protection Insurance Policy as this may effect 
                  any payments the D.W.P. may make.<br>

                  18. <b>METHODS OF CALCULATING INTEREST ON MORTGAGES<br>
                  <br>
                  </b><font color="#FF0000">i)</font> <b>Interest charged on an 
                  annual basis</b>. If your chosen mortgage product states that 
                  interest is charged on an annual basis, this means that interest 
                  will be charged initially on the mortgage advance from the date 
                  that it is released, through to the Society's year end on 30th 
                  November. This interest will be debited to the mortgage account 
                  on the date that the advance is released. Thereafter, on the 
                  1st December each year, a full year's interest will be charged 
                  on the balance brought forward at the close of business on the 
                  Society's year end, 30th November. This interest charge will 
                  be varied during the year to take account of changes in the 
                  rate of interest which we will advise to you.<br>
                  <br>
                  <font color="#FF0000">ii)</font> <b>Daily Interest</b>. If your 
                  chosen mortgage product states that interest is to be charged 
                  on a daily basis, interest will be calculated from the date 
                  of the advance through to the end of the month of the release 
                  of the advance. At the end of the month in which the advance 
                  is released, the mortgage account will be debited with this 
                  first month's interest. Thereafter, interest is calculated for 
                  each day the advance is outstanding, based on the account balance 
                  on that day, and the account is debited at the end of each month 
                  with the accrued daily interest for that month.<br>

                  <font color="#FF0000">iii)</font> <b>Interest for the month 
                  of completion</b>. Interest charges from the date of the mortgage 
                  advance up to the end of the month of the advance are not included 
                  in the first monthly payment due to the Society. You will be 
                  advised of the amount of this interest so that you may make 
                  a separate payment for this should you wish or, alternatively, 
                  it will be added to your account in which case it will attract 
                  further interest charges.<br>

                  <br>
                  </b>The interest rates which apply to your mortgage may change 
                  from time to time. Your Mortgage Illustration will tell you

                  calculation facility. It will also tell you if the rate of interest 
                  is variable or fixed, and for what period. When we change the

                  20. <b>CHANGES TO TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
                  <br>
                  </b>Occasionally terms and conditions may have to be changed. 
                  We will tell you how you will be notified of these changes and 
                  will give you at least 30 days before any change takes effect. 
                  If there have been significant changes in any one year, we will 
                  give or send you a copy of the new Terms and Conditions or a 
                  summary of the charges.<br>

                  21. <b>COMPLAINTS<br>
                  <br>
                  </b>We aim to provide high standards of service. However, there 
                  may be occasion when you feel that you may have a complaint, 
                  in which case our staff will try to resolve the problem. Whilst 
                  we hope we can resolve any problems through these internal procedures, 
                  we are also a member of the Financial Ombudsman Service to which 
                  customers can appeal after internal procedures have been exhausted. 
                  Written details of our Complaints Procedure and of the Financial 
                  Ombudsman Service will be provided on request from any of our 
                  Branches or from Principal Office. We will respond to your initial 
                  complaint within two working days. We aim to answer your complaint 
                  within 10 working days but please recognise that more complex 
                  issues may take up to 28 days to resolve before we notify you 
                  of our findings.<br>

                  22. <b>MEMBERSHIP RIGHTS<br>
                  <br>
                  </b>The first named applicant in the Mortgage Application form 
                  will be the Society's member with borrowing membership rights. 
                  The name provided in the Mortgage Application form must be in 
                  the same style as on any other account held with the Society 
                  to ensure that the Society does not provide duplicate mailings 
                  to you.<br>
                  <br>
                  The registered address for service of any notice will be the 
                  security address in the Mortgage Application form. If your mortgage 
                  has been granted for commercial purposes the registered address, 
                  unless you have notified us of another address for this purpose, 
                  will be the address provided in the Mortgage Application form 
                  under the heading &quot;Present Address&quot;.<br>
                  <br>
                  Membership will cease if the Society exercises its power of 
                  sale, or the Society takes possession of the property.<br>
                  <br>
                  The first named applicant in the Mortgage Application form shall 
                  be the representative joint borrower if there is more than one 
                  borrower. If you wish to change the person who is the representative 
                  joint borrower, the change will take effect when the Society's 
                  records are amended.<br>
                  <br>
                  YOUR HOME WILL BE TAKEN AS SECURITY FOR ANY LOAN ADVANCED TO 
                  YOU BY THE SOCIETY.<br>
                  <br>
                  YOUR HOME IS AT RISK IF YOU DO NOT KEEP UP REPAYMENTS ON A MORTGAGE 
                  OR OTHER LOAN SECURED ON IT.</p>
