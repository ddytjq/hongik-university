 APOD: February 26, 1999 - Dark Cloud
</a>
<br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

possibly only 1,000 light-years distant.

Near its core it is dense enough to
block almost all of the light from the numerous,
more distant stars visible toward

In addition to
<a href="ap980104.html">dust grains</a>,
dark nebulae which abound in the plane of our
Galaxy are likely to contain

 APOD: January 28, 1999 - The Galactic Center  A Radio Mystery
</a>
<br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

<a href="http://www.pagecreations.com/astrocappella/welcome.html"
>Tuning in</a> to the center of our Milky Way galaxy, radio astronomers
explore a complex, mysterious place.

A premier high resolution view,
<a href="http://rsd-www.nrl.navy.mil/7213/lazio/GC/"
>this startlingly beautiful picture</a>
covers a 4x4 degree region around the galactic center.

It was constructed from 1 meter wavelength radio data
obtained by telescopes of the
<a href="ap970727.html">Very Large Array</a> near
Socorro, New Mexico, USA.

<a href="ap971111.html">The galactic center</a>
itself is at the edge of the extremely
bright object labeled Sagittarius (Sgr) A, suspected of harboring
a million solar mass black hole.

<a href="http://rsd-www.nrl.navy.mil/7213/lazio/GC/GCSchematicscan2rot.gif"
>Along the galactic plane</a> which runs diagonally
through the image are tortured clouds of gas energized by
hot stars and round-shaped supernova remnants (SNRs)
- hallmarks of
<a href="http://www.astro.nwu.edu/astro/purcell/511kev_press_release/"
>a violent</a> and
<a href="ap980729.html">energetic cosmic environment</a>.

But perhaps most intriguing are
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1991MNRAS%2E249%2E%2E262A&db_key=AST">the arcs, threads, and filaments</a> which
abound in the scene.

Their uncertain origins challenge
present theories of the dynamics of the galactic center.

 APOD: October 2, 1998 - Magnetar In The Sky
</a>
<br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

Indicated on this
<a href="ap970315.html">infrared image of the galactic center</a> region
is the position of SGR 1900+14 - the strongest known magnet in the galaxy.

SGR 1900+14 is believed to be a
<a href="http://astro.uchicago.edu/home/web/miller/ns.gif">city-sized</a>,
spinning, super-magnetic neutron star,
<a href="http://www.magnetars.com/">or Magnetar</a>.

How strong is a Magnetar's magnetic field?

The Earth's magnetic field which deflects compass needles is measured
to be about 1 Gauss,
the strongest fields sustainable in Earth-based laboratories are
about 100,000 Gauss, yet the Magnetar's monster magnetic field
is estimated to be 1,000,000,000,000,000 Gauss.

<a href="http://www.magnetars.com/#visit"
>A magnet this strong</a>, located at about half the distance to the Moon
would easily erase your credit cards and suck pens out of your pocket.

From a distance of about 20,000 light-years,
SGR 1900+14 recently generated
<a href="ap980903.html">a powerful flash of gamma-rays detected</a>
by many spacecraft.

<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast29sep98_1.htm"
>That blast of high-energy radiation</a> is now known to have
had a measurable effect on Earth's ionosphere.

<a href="http://science.msfc.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast09Jul98_1.htm"
>At the surface of the Magnetar</a>,
its powerful magnetic field is thought to buckle and shift the neutron
star crust generating the intense gamma-ray flares.

 APOD: July 29, 1998 - The High Energy Heart Of The Milky Way
</a>
<br>
<b> Explanation: </b>

These high resolution false color pictures of the Galactic center
region in high energy
<a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html"
>X-ray and gamma-ray light</a> result from a very long
exposure of roughly 3,000 hours performed from 1990 to 1997 by the
<a href="http://hea.iki.rssi.ru/GRANAT/sigma/sigma.html"
>French SIGMA telescope</a> onboard the
<a href="http://hea.iki.rssi.ru/GRANAT/granat.html"
>Russian GRANAT spacecraft</a>.

Each image covers a 14x14 degree field which includes most of the
central bulge of
<a href="ap971229.html">our Milky Way Galaxy</a>.

The X-ray picture (left) reveals a cluster of sources
releasing enormous amounts of energy.

They are probably
<a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/features/movies/binaries.html"
>binary star systems where</a> matter accretes
onto a collapsed object, either
<a href="ap980723.html">a neutron star</a> or
<a href="ap970516.html">a black hole</a>.

But
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=J98-00849&db_key=AST&high=351636804424864">according to recent theories</a>, only those
<a href="http://astrosun.tn.cornell.edu/courses/astro201/top_xrays.htm"
>binary systems with black holes</a>
can radiate above X-ray energies -- in the gamma-ray regime.

In that case, the SIGMA sources also shining in the gamma-ray picture
(right) betray the presence of accreting
<a href="http://astrosun.tn.cornell.edu/courses/astro201/bh_candidates.htm"
>stellar black holes</a>!

Surprisingly, no high energy source seems to coincide exactly
with the Galactic center itself,
located near the brightest source at the bottom of both
pictures.

This indicates that
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1996ApJ%2E%2E%2E456%2E%2E194H&db_key=AST">the large black hole</a>
thought
<a href="ap970114.html">to be lurking there</a>
is unexpectedly quiet at these energies.

<br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
You are here.  The orange dot in the <a href=

 APOD: February 16, 1998 - Sagittarius Dwarf to Collide with Milky Way
</a>
<br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 
<a href="ap971229.html">Our Galaxy</a> is being invaded.  <a href=
"http://www.jhu.edu/news_info/news/home98/feb98/invader.html"
>Recent observations</a> indicate that in 
the next 100 million years, the 
<a href="ap970329.html">Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy</a> 
will move though the disk of our own 
<a href="ap970517.html">Milky Way Galaxy</a> 
<i> yet again </i>.  The 
<a href="http://www.seds.org/messier/more/SagdEg.html"
>Sagittarius Dwarf</a> (Sgr), shown as the extended irregular
shape below the Galactic Center,  
is the closest of 9 known small 
<a href="http://www.astro.uu.se/~ns/review.html"
>dwarf spheroidal</a> galaxies that orbit our Galaxy.  
Don't worry, our Galaxy is not in danger, 
but no such assurances are issued for the 
Sagittarius Dwarf: the intense gravitational 
tidal forces might pull it apart.  Oddly, however, 
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9612025"
>Sgr's orbit</a> indicates that is has been through 
our Galaxy several times before, and survived!  
One possibility is that Sgr contains a great deal of 
low-density <a href=

 APOD: January 17, 1998 - At The Core Of M15
</a>
<br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 

Densely packed stars in the core of the
<a href="ap960221.html">globular cluster</a>
<a href="ap950726.html">M15</a> are shown
in this <a href="ap970306.html">Hubble Space Telescope</a> (HST) image.

The <a href="ap961202.html">star colors</a>
roughly indicate their temperatures - hot stars
appear blue, cooler stars look reddish-orange.

<a href="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/press-releases/95-06.txt"
>The region visible here</a> is only about 1.6 light-years across, 
compared to the 4.3 light-year distance to
<a href="ap960526.html">our own Sun's nearest neighbor</a>.

<a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/"
>Imagine</a> the night
<a href="http://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/"
>sky view</a>ed from a planet orbiting a star near this cluster's
center!

M15 has long been
recognized as one of the densest clusters of stars in our galaxy outside of
the <a href="ap971111.html">galactic center</a> itself.

Even the unprecedented resolving
power of the HST cameras could not separate the individual stars in its
innermost regions.

However,
<a href="http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/95/06.html">
this HST image</a> reveals that the density of stars continues
to rise toward the cluster's core, suggesting that a sudden,
runaway collapse due to the gravitational attraction of many closely
packed stars or a single central massive object, perhaps a
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html">black hole</a>,
could account for the core's extreme density.

 APOD: December 8, 1997 - The Trifid Nebula in Red, White and Blue
</a>
<br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 
Three dark dust lanes give the picturesque 
<a href="http://www.seds.org/messier/m/m020.html"
>Trifid Nebula</a> its name.  
The red and blue colors of the 
<a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/twn/n6514x.html"
>Trifid Nebula</a> are present in different regions 
and are created by different processes.  

A big bright star near the center of the 
red region appears white hot and emits light so energetic it knocks 
<a href="http://pdg.lbl.gov/cpep/adventure.html"
>electrons</a> away from gas surrounding it.  
When an electron is recaptured by a proton, 
red light is frequently emitted.  

The <a href=
"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1986AJ%2E%2E%2E%2E%2E92%2E1125L&db_key=AST&nosetcookie=1"
>blue region</a> is centered on 
another bright star but this region's 
<a href="ap961119.html">dust</a> reflects light to us.  
The two regions are thus called an 
<a href="lib/emission.html">emission nebula</a> and 
<a href="lib/reflection.html">reflection nebula</a>, respectively.  
The <a href="ap970828.html"

 APOD: November 5, 1997 - The Milky Way's Gamma-Ray Halo
</a>
<br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 

<a href="http://tigre.ucr.edu/halo/halo.html"
>Our Milky Way galaxy appears to be surrounded by a halo of gamma rays</a>.

Gamma rays are the most energetic form of
<a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html"
>electromagnetic radiation</a>, with
more than a hundred thousand times the energy of visible light,
<a href="ap970222.html">but known gamma-ray sources</a>
don't account for the diffuse distribution of this high-energy glow.

This surprising result
<a href="http://tigre.ucr.edu/halo/tipsh.html">is based on data</a>
from the EGRET instrument onboard
<a href="ap970606.html">the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory</a>. 

In this false color
all-sky image centered on
<a href="ap970517.html">the Milky Way</a>, the
brown and green regions indicate brighter, known sources of gamma-rays.

The galactic center and plane clearly standout as do some
distant galaxies seen near the top and bottom of the picture.

The dim, blue regions above and
below the plane correspond to our Galaxy's unexpected gamma-ray halo.

<i>
What causes the halo?
</i>

<a href="http://www-glast.stanford.edu">Future gamma-ray telescopes</a>
could solve this mystery.

However, the excitement has already inspired tantalizing
speculation about the solution including;

collisions of low energy photons with
<a href="ap961016.html">high-energy cosmic rays</a>,

high energy electrons accelerated by a previous burst of
Milky Way <a href="ap971027.html">star formation</a>,

and exotic interacting particles which make up
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/matter.html"
>Dark Matter</a>.

 APOD: May 1, 1997 - A Galactic Cloud of Antimatter
</a>
<br>
<B>Explanation</B>:  

<a href="ap970121.html"
>The center of our Milky Way Galaxy is full of surprises</a>.
Its latest spectacular is
<a href="http://www.astro.nwu.edu/astro/purcell/511kev_press_release/"
>a mysterious cloud glowing in gamma rays produced
by annihilating antimatter particles!</a>

Star Trek fans are all too familiar with the consequences of mixing
<a href="http://hepwww.rl.ac.uk/pub/bigbang/file4.html"
>matter (electrons) and antimatter (positrons)</a> -
the particles
<a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Images/learning_center/basic/
gamma/matter_vs_antimatter.gif"
>catastrophically annihilate</a>
converting their masses to energy according to Einstein's famous
E=mc<sup>2</sup>.

Positron/electron annihilation energy is emitted
<a href="http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cossc/whatgam.html"
>as gamma rays with
photon energies</a> of 511,000 electron volts.

Searching for these high energy photons,
<a href="http://osse-www.nrl.navy.mil/osse.htm"
>the OSSE instrument</a> onboard NASA's orbiting
<a href="http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/gamma/bro/bro1.html"
>Compton Gamma Ray Observatory</a> has
<a href="http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cossc/ld.html"
>recently produced</a> this map of the
<a href="http://osse-www.nrl.navy.mil/dermer/galctr.jpg"
>Galactic Center (GC) region</a>.  As anticipated, it shows
<a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/learning_center/museum/
exploratorium/gamma_generation.html">annihilation gamma rays</a>
as a bright spot at the GC
with fainter horizontal emission from the galactic plane.

Astoundingly, it also reveals a large and unexpected cloud
of annihilation radiation, probably about 4,000 light years across,
extending nearly 3,500 light years above the GC.

<i>What could have created this cloud?</i>

Associated with no previously known object,
it seems to imply that a
<a href="http://osse-www.nrl.navy.mil/dermer/annih.html"
>fountain of antimatter positrons streams from the GC</a>.

Present guesses about the source of the positrons include
<a href="http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cossc/nasm/VU/vu.html"
>the violent and exotic environments</a> surrounding starbirth,
neutron star collisions, and black holes at the GC.

 APOD: April 30, 1997 - Milky Way Molecule Map
</a>
<br>
<B>Explanation</B>:  
Where are the Milky Way's gas clouds and where are they going?   
<a href="ap970119.html">Stars form in gas clouds</a>, 
and the motion of gas clouds tell us about the
size and rotation speed of our own 
<a href="ap970315.html">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.
But gas clouds are hard to detect - they are
composed mostly of  nearly invisible molecular
<a href="lib/glossary.html#hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and 
<a href="lib/glossary.html#helium">helium</a>. 
Fortunately, at least small amounts of heavier gases co-exist, one of them being 
<a href="http://www.carsondunlop.com/co.html">carbon monoxide</a> (CO), 
which is relatively easy to detect at radio wavelengths.
Therefore, over the past decade, a 
<a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/hotimage/milky.html">team of astronomers</a> have 
<a href="http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-article_query?1987ApJ%2E%2E%2E322%2E%2E706D&nosetcookie=1">carefully 
mapped</a> out the molecular sky to unprecedented 
clarity - to about four times previous resolution 
and about eight times previous sensitivity.  The resulting 
<a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~nlopez/minitel/">map is shown above</a>, 
rescaled and in false color, with dark blue 
being relatively low emission.   The band of our 
<a href="http://astro.gmu.edu/classes/a10696/notes/l18/l18.html">Milky Way Galaxy</a> 
spans the middle. The data have not only helped our understanding of the 
<a href="http://www.physics.gmu.edu/classinfo/astr103/CourseNotes/glx_mway.htm">Galaxy</a>, 
but highlight a few mysteries too.  For example:

 APOD: March 15, 1997 - The Milky Way's Center  
</a>
<br>
<B>Explanation</B>: Although the Earth is round, our Galaxy appears
truly flat.  This was shown in dramatic fashion by the <A HREF="http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/cobe/cobe_home.html" >COsmic Background Explorer (COBE)</A>
satellite which produced this premier view of the central region
of our own <A HREF="lib/milky_way.html" >Milky Way Galaxy</A>
in infrared light in1990. The <A HREF="ap960213.html" >Milky Way</A>
is a typical <A HREF="ap970228.html" >spiral galaxy</A> with a
central bulge and extended disk of stars. However, gas and <A HREF="ap961119.html" >dust</A>
within the disk obscure visible wavelengths of light effectively
preventing clear observations of the center. Since <A HREF="lib/glossary.html#infrared" >infrared</A>
wavelengths are less affected by the obscuring material, the <A HREF="http://nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov/anon_dir/cobe/images/dirbe/dirbe_photo.gif" >Diffuse InfraRed Background Experiment (DIRBE)</A>
on board <A HREF="http://spectrum.lbl.gov/www/cobe/cobe.html" >COBE</A>
was able to detected <A HREF="http://www2.ari.net/home/odenwald/cobeim.html" >infrared light from stars surrounding the Galactic center</A>
and produce this image. Of course, the edge on perspective represents
the view from the vicinity of <A HREF="ap960916.html" >our Sun</A>,
a star located in the disk about 30,000 light years out from the
center. The <A HREF="http://nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov/anon_dir/cobe/initial_products/dirbe/doc/dirbe_synopsis.doc" >DIRBE</A>
module used equipment cooled by a tub of liquid helium to detect
the infrared light which, composed of <A HREF="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/learning_center/basic/emspectrum.html" >wavelengths longer than red light</A>,
is invisible to the <A HREF="http://www.jovian.com/atmob/Articles/AstroAndEye.html" >human eye</A>.

 APOD: January 21, 1997 - Journey to the Center of the Galaxy

<br>
<B>Explanation</B>:

In <A HREF="http://www.interlog.com/~anash/najvs.html"
>Jules Verne</A>'s science fiction classic
<A HREF="gopher://gopher.vt.edu:10010/02/153/1"
>A Journey to the Center of the Earth</A>,
Professor Hardwigg and his fellow explorers
encounter many strange and exciting wonders.

What wonders lie at the center of <A HREF="ap960213.html" >our Galaxy</A>?

Astronomers now know of some of the bizarre objects which exist there,
like <A HREF="ap960528.html" >vast dust clouds</A>,
<A HREF="ap960903.html">bright young stars</A>,
<A HREF="http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/

nph-bib_query?1996ApJ%2E%2E%2E456%2E%2E194H&db_key=AST"
>large black hole</A>.

Much of the <A HREF="ap950908.html">Galactic center region</A>
is shielded from our view in visible light by the
intervening dust and gas.

But it can be explored using other forms of electromagnetic
radiation, like
<A HREF="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/learning_center/museum/

 APOD: January 18, 1997 - M16: Nebula With Star Cluster
</a>
<br>
<B>Explanation</B>:

The photogenic 
<a href="ap960626.html">M</a>16 shown above is composed of a 
<a href="ap950620.html">young star cluster</a> associated with a
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/m/m016.html">
spectacular emission nebulae</a> 
lined with clouds of 
<a href="ap961119.html">interstellar dust</a>.  

The gorgeous spectacle lies toward 
<a href="ap960723.html">the galactic center region</a>,
some 7,000 light years distant in
<a href="http://galileo.gmu.edu/constellation/SER.html"
>the constellation Serpens</a>.

Most of <a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/cluster.html">
the stars in the cluster</a> 
can be seen offset just above and to the right of the photograph's center. 
This type of star cluster is called an "open" or "galactic" cluster and
typically has a few hundred young bright members. The redness of the
surrounding 
<a href="lib/glossary.html#emis_neb">emission nebula</a> gas is caused by 
electrons recombining
<a href="ap961218.html"
>with hydrogen</a> nuclei, while the dark regions are 
<a href="ap950828.html">dust lanes</a> that absorb light
from background sources. The dust absorbs so much light it allows
astronomers to determine which stars are inside the nebula and which are in
the foreground.

<br>
<b> Explanation: </b>
Launched in 1990, the orbiting
<a href="http://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/rosat.html"
>ROSAT observatory</a> explored the Universe by
viewing the entire
<a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/learning_center/

>sky in x-rays</a> - photons with about 1,000 times
<a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/learning_center/
basic/emspectrum.html">more energy than visible light</a>.
<a href="http://www.rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de/survey/sxrb/"
>This ROSAT survey </a> produced the sharpest, most sensitive
image of the x-ray sky to date.
The all-sky image is shown with
<a href="ap960213.html">the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy</a> running
horizontally through the center.  Both x-ray brightness and relative energy
are represented with red, green, and blue colors indicating three
x-ray energy ranges (from lowest to highest).

Bright x-ray spots near the galactic plane are within our own Milky Way.
The brightest region (right of center) is toward the Vela Pulsar and the
<a href="http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/users/jonathan/outreach_pages/
neutron_stars.html">Puppis supernova remnant</a>.
Bright sources beyond our Galaxy are also
apparent, notably the <a href="ap960419.html">Virgo cluster of galaxies</a>
(near top right) and
<a href="ap950918.html">the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)</a>.
The LMC is easy to find here as
several of the black stripes (blank areas caused by missing data) seem
to converge on its position (lower right).

>Over large areas of the sky a general diffuse background of
x-rays dominates</a>.  Hot gas in our own Galaxy provides
much of this background and gives rise to the grand looping structures
visible in the direction of the galactic center (image center).
Unresolved extragalactic sources also add to this background, particularly
above and below the plane.
Despite the x-ray sky's exotic appearance,
a very familiar feature is visible -
the gas and dust clouds which line the plane of our galaxy
absorb x-rays as well
as optical light and produce

<b> Explanation: </b> 
Spiral galaxy M66 is largest galaxy in the a group known as the Leo
Triplet. 
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/m/m066.html">M66</a> 
is somewhat peculiar because of its asymmetric spiral arms. 
Usually dense waves of gas, dust, and newly formed stars - called spiral

<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/more/m066gr.html">Leo

>Recent research indicates</a> that
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/more/m065-066_more.html">M66</a>

<a href="ap960213.html">The Galactic plane</a>

the Galactic center in the middle of the picture, as indicated by

<a href="http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cossc/descriptions/comptel_al26.html"
>The radioactive Al26 clouds</a> are
seen to lie in clumps near the plane, with some slightly above and
below it.  The brightest feature looks like a mysterious inverted "V", just
to the left of center.

<i>Where do they come from?</i>
<a href="http://www.dne.bnl.gov/CoN/nuc/A/Al26.shtml"
>Al26 decays to magnesium (Mg26)</a> with
<a href="http://www.uilondon.org/h.html">a half-life</a>
of about a million years, a very short time compared to the
<a href="ap960513.html" >age of the Galaxy</a> -- so the clouds
must have been produced relatively "recently".
<a href="http://wwwgro.unh.edu:8080/comptel/comptel_publications.html"
>COMPTEL astronomers</a> are exploring
several origins for the radioactive clouds including
<a href="http://www.fysik.lu.se/nucleardata/welcome.htm"
>nuclear</a> processing (nucleosynthesis) by aging massive stars
<a href="ap960509.html">and supernova explosions</a>.
Because they are generally thought to be associated with short lived massive

 APOD: May 29, 1996 - The COMPTEL Gamma-Ray Sky
</a>
<br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 
This premier gamma-ray view of the sky was produced by
<a href="http://wwwgro.unh.edu:8080/comptel/comptel_main.html"
>the COMPTEL instrument</a>
onboard NASA's orbiting
<a href="ap951129.html">Compton Gamma Ray Observatory</a>.
The entire sky is seen projected on a coordinate system
centered on <a href="ap960213.html">our Milky Way Galaxy</a> with the
<a href="ap950908.html">plane of the Galaxy</a>
running across the middle of the picture.
Gamma-ray intensity is represented by a false color map -
low (blue) to high (white).
<a href="http://wwwgro.unh.edu:8080/comptel/comptel_highlights.html"
>COMPTEL's sensitivity to gamma-rays</a> which have
over 1 million times the energy of visible light photons
reveals the locations of some of the Galaxy's most exotic objects.
The brightest  source, <a href="ap951122.html">the Crab pulsar</a>,
is located near the plane of the Galaxy on the far right.
Moving along the plane from the Crab, more than halfway toward
the galactic center, another bright gamma-ray source,
<a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cossc/descriptions/egret_pulsars.html"
>the Vela pulsar</a>, appears.
The galactic center itself, along with the
<a href="http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~spac250/steve/ident.html"
>famous black hole candidate Cygnus X-1</a> (near the plane, halfway from the
center to the left edge) are also seen as bright sources.
Both above and below the plane, spots of gamma-ray emission due to
<a href="ap951023.html">distant active galaxies</a> are also visible.

 APOD: March 8, 1996 - The 76 Meter Lovell Radio Telescope
</a>
<br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 
<a href="http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/">Jodrell Bank</a> 
in England is the home of the 
<a href="http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/Lovell-Telescope.html">Lovell 
Telescope</a> one of the largest radio telescopes in the world.  Completed
in 1957 under the direction of Bernard Lovell, the 250 ft. diameter dish 
<a href="http://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/effberg.html">was</a> 
the largest <i>steerable</i> radio telescope. The telescope has been used
to monitor extremely faint radio emissions from space, including the
transmissions of the 
<a href="http://pyroeis.arc.nasa.gov/pioneer/PNhome.html">Pioneer

 APOD: February 28, 1996 - Explosions Discovered Near Galactic Center
</a>
<br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 
Tremendous explosions near the center of our Galaxy were discovered just
this past December and are being announced today by a paper in 
<a href="http://www.america.nature.com/">Nature</a> and a press conference at 
<a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/NewsRoom/today.html">NASA</a>. 
Bursts like these have never been seen before, and so the exact cause is
unknown and will likely be the source of 
<a href="http://space.mit.edu/%7Erutledge/TRANS/trans.html">
astronomical speculations and
observations</a> for years to come.  Much more powerful than any 
explosions we humans can create, these eruptions 
<a href="http://space.mit.edu/%7Erutledge/TRANS/PP/RB.ps">likely involve 
the extreme conditions</a>
found only on the surface of a 
<a href="http://astro.uchicago.edu/home/web/miller/nstar.html">neutron 
star</a> in a
<a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/binary.html">binary system</a>,
possibly similar to the X-ray binary system depicted in the above drawing.
The new source, dubbed 
<a href="ap950811.html">GRO</a> J1744-28 for its discovery
spacecraft and position, currently produces multiple
<a href="http://olegacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/learning_ctr/burster.html"
>pulsed bursts of energy</a>
per day, each of which last several seconds.  The 
<a href="http://astro.uchicago.edu/hot/hot8.html">bursts</a> are quite
prominent in 
<a href="lib/glossary.html#X-ray">X-ray</a> light.  Discovery team leaders 
include Chryssa Kouveliotou 
(<a href="http://www.usra.edu/">USRA</a>) and Gerald Fishman

 APOD: February 27, 1996 - X-ray Moon and X-ray Star
</a>
<br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 

An X-ray star winks out behind the Moon in these before and after
views of a
<a href="http://www.sky.net/~robinson/iotandx.htm"
>lunar occultation</a> of the
<a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Images/rosat/rosat18.html"
>galactic X-ray source designated GX5-1</a>.
The false color images were made using data from the
<a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/rosat/rosat3.html">ROSAT
orbiting observatory</a> and show high energy X-rays in yellow (mostly from
GX5-1), and lower energy X-rays in red (the Moon reflecting
<a href="ap951004.html">X-rays from the Sun</a>).  GX5-1 is a 
<a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/binary.html"
>binary system</a> consisting of a
<a href="lib/glossary.html#ns">neutron star</a> and a companion star in
mutual orbit about the system's center of mass.
The gas in the companion star's outer envelope falls toward the neutron star
and <a href="ap951226.html">accumulates in a disk</a> around it.
This disk material swirls deeper in to
the <a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html"
>neutron star's gravitational well</a>, and is finally dumped onto
its surface - in the process creating tremendous
temperatures and generating the high energy X-rays.

 APOD: January 2, 1996 - The X-Ray Sky
</a>
<br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 
What if you could see
<a href="lib/glossary.html#X-ray">X-rays</a>?
If you could, the
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/jbonnell/www/multiw_sky.html">
night sky</a> would be a strange and unfamiliar place.
X-rays are about 1,000 times more energetic
than visible light photons and are produced in violent and high
temperature astrophysical environments.  Instead of the familiar
steady stars, the sky would seem to be filled with
<a href="ap951226.html">exotic binary star systems</a>
composed of <a href="ap950910.html">white dwarfs</a>,
<a href="ap951122.html">neutron stars</a>, and
<a href="ap951127.html">black holes</a>, along with
flare stars, X-ray bursters,
<a href="http://pulsar.princeton.edu/rpr.shtml">pulsars</a>,
<a href="ap951203.html">supernova remnants</a> and
<a href="ap951022.html">active galaxies</a>.
This X-ray image of the entire sky was constructed with
<a href="http://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov">Skyview</a>,
using <a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heao1/
heao1a2_gifbrowser.html">data from the first
High Energy Astronomy Observatory (HEAO 1)</a>,
and plotted in a coordinate system centered on the galactic center
with the north galactic pole at the top.
<a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/Images/heao1/heao1.gif">
Sources</a> near the galactic center are seen to dominate in this
false color map which shows regions of highest X-ray intensity in yellow.
Astronomers' ability to observe the sky at X-ray energies
will be greatly enhanced by the recently launched
X-ray Timing Explorer (<a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/
xte/xte_1st.html">XTE</a>) satellite.

 APOD: November 20, 1995 - At the Core of M15
</a>
<br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 

Densely packed stars in the core of the globular cluster
<a href="ap950726.html">M15</a> are shown
in this <a href="ap950810.html">Hubble Space Telescope</a> (HST)
image taken in April of 1994.  The
stars revealed are contained in an area 1.6 light years across and
their colors roughly indicate their temperatures - hot stars
appear blue, cooler stars look reddish-orange.  M15 has long been
recognized as one of the densest cluster of stars in our galaxy outside of
the <a href="ap950908.html">galactic center</a> itself.
Even the unprecedented resolving
power of the HST cameras could not separate the individual stars in its
innermost regions.  However,
<a href="http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/95/06.html">
this HST image</a> reveals that the density of stars continues
to rise toward the cluster's core, suggesting that a sudden,
runaway collapse due to the gravitational attraction of many closely
packed stars or a single central massive object, perhaps a
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn_bht.html">black hole</a>,
could account for the core's extreme density.

 APOD: October 19, 1995 - Globular Cluster M5 
</a>
<br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 
The globular cluster 
<a href="lib/glossary.html#messier">M</a>5, pictured above, contains 
roughly 100,000 stars.
These stars formed together and are gravitationally bound.  Stars orbit the
center of the cluster, and the cluster orbits the center of our Galaxy. So
far, about 160 
<a href="ap950726.html">globular clusters</a> 
are known to exist in a roughly spherical halo around the 
<a href="ap950908.html">Galactic center</a>. 
<a href="http://ast.leeds.ac.uk/research/gcs.html">Globular clusters</a> 
do not appear spherically distributed as viewed from the Earth, and this
fact was a key point in the determination that our 
<a href="ap950813.html">Sun</a> is 
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/diamond_jubilee/debate_1920.html"
>not at the center</a> of our
Galaxy. Globular clusters are very old. There is a straightforward 
<a href="http://ast.leeds.ac.uk/research/age.html">method
of determining their age</a>, and this provides a very interesting lower limit
on the age of our universe of about 14 billion years.

 APOD: September 8, 1995 - The Milky Way's Center 
</a>
<br>
<b> Explanation: </b> 
NASA's
<a href="http://nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov/anon_dir/cobe/images/cobe_satellite.gif">
COBE satellite</a> scanned the heavens at infrared wavelengths in
1990 and produced this premier view of the central region of our own Milky Way
Galaxy.  The Milky Way is a typical spiral
<a href="ftp://crux.astr.ua.edu/web/goodies/data_resources/galaxies.text">
galaxy</a> with a central bulge and extended disk of stars.  However, gas
and <a href="lib/glossary.html#dust">dust</a>
within the disk obscure visible wavelengths of light effectively
<a href="http://www.eia.brad.ac.uk/btl/gy1.html">
preventing clear observations of the center</a>.  Since infrared
wavelengths, are less affected by the obscuring material, the <a
href="http://nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov/anon_dir/cobe/images/dirbe/dirbe_photo.gif">
Diffuse InfraRed Background Experiment (DIRBE)</a>
on board COBE was able to
detected infrared light from stars surrounding the galactic center and
produce this image.
Of course, the edge on perspective represents
the view from the vicinity of our <a href="ap950813.html">Sun</a>,
a star located in the disk about 30,000 light years out from the center.
The DIRBE experiment used equipment cooled by a tub
of liquid helium to detect the infrared light which, composed of wavelengths
longer than red light, is invisible to the human eye.
