ABSTRACT:  The authors describe a new complication observed in patients after
transplantation of the kidneys, characterized by intensive periarticular pain
of the joints of the lower extremities, mostly with a symmetrical affection of
the heels and knees, associated with vasomotor changes in the affected area,
X-ray evidence of patchy osteoporosis and an increased periarticular activity
of radionuclide on bone scans. The symptoms develop shortly after
transplantation and recede within several months. The clinical findings, X-ray
and scintigraphic changes are typical for the syndrome of reflex sympathetic
dystrophy. The etiology of the syndrome remains obscure, the symptomatology
recedes parallel with reduction of the dosage and levels of cyclosporin A.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS) is a rarely described
complication after different types of organ transplants. Three out of 147
kidney recipients treated at our center during the last 6 years developed
severe bilateral symmetrical pain in the ankles and knees, with great
difficulties in walking 2-3 months after kidney transplantation. Clinical
examination revealed periarticular soft tissue swelling and vasomotor changes
with no effusion. Patchy osteoporotic patterns were seen radiographically in
clinically affected areas. Scintigraphy showed increased epiphyseal uptake of
99mTc with a periarticular distribution. Clinical symptoms, radiographic, and
scintigraphic signs were compatible with so-called RSDS. The exact cause of the
syndrome remained obscure. All patients received standard immunosuppression
with cyclosporine A (CyA), azathioprine, and prednisone. Symptoms of RSDS
improved when doses of CyA were reduced and blood levels declined; patients
were treated with calcitonin and calcium channel blockers simultaneously.
Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs were not effective in symptom relief. In
all three cases, most probably spontaneous complete recovery was achieved over
the course of 2-8 months; no one patient progressed to aseptic osteonecrosis.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We discuss the role of imaging techniques in examining the athletes
with sports injuries involving the pelvis and the hip. Pelvis and hip pain is
of difficult clinical clarification because of the various athletic injuries
which may affect the bone or soft tissues at different anatomic sites.
Moreover, the symptoms of pelvis and hip injuries are similar in most cases and
they are often diffuse and atypical. Diagnostic imaging can play an essential
role because treatment success depends on a correct diagnosis and these
techniques can actually differentiate the most frequent causes of pelvis and
hip sports injuries such as groin strain, osteitis pubis, ischial intersection
syndrome, snapping hip, stress fractures, hernias and avulsion fractures.
Finally, we discuss the role of magnetic resonance imaging in detecting the
causes of hip pain other than sports injuries, such as avascular necrosis,
reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome, herniation pit, acetabular labrum
injuries. To conclude, diagnostic imaging techniques currently permit the
direct and noninvasive depiction of pelvis and hip conditions. Particularly,
magnetic resonance imaging is very helpful in detecting injury site, extent and
characteristics; it can also predict the time period an athlete will be
disabled and help define the best treatment planning.<p>

ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND: Topical capsaicin is known to be a safe and effective
pain management adjunct for rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, neuralgias,
and diabetic neuropathy. However, studies and case reports in the literature
have indicated that other conditions may also benefit from capsaicin: painful
or itching cutaneous disorders from operations, injuries, or tumors; neural
dysfunction; or inflammation of the airways and urinary tract. METHODS: To
determine the effectiveness of capsaicin for painful cutaneous disorders and
neural dysfunction, the authors analyzed data from 33 reports (MEDLINE search
of 1966-96) on the efficacy of capsaicin. Outcome measures consisted of the
response rate and degree of pain relief. Results from placebo-controlled trials
were pooled when possible; effect of treatment was estimated by the method of
DerSimonian and Laird. RESULTS: Pain relief for postmastectomy syndrome and
cluster headache was greater with capsaicin than with placebo; also, psoriasis
and pruritus responded better to capsaicin. Uncontrolled studies and case
reports have indicated that pain or dysfunction was less at the end of
capsaicin therapy for neck pain, loin pain/hematuria syndrome, oral mucositis,
rhinopathy, reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome, detrusor hyperreflexia, and
cutaneous pain due to tumor of the skin. CONCLUSIONS: Capsaicin is effective
for psoriasis, pruritus, and cluster headache; it is often helpful for the
itching and pain of postmastectomy pain syndrome, oral mucositis, cutaneous
allergy, loin pain/hematuria syndrome, neck pain, amputation stump pain, and
skin tumor; and it may be beneficial for neural dysfunction (detrusor
hyperreflexia, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and rhinopathy). A universal
problem for many of the studies analyzed was the absence of a "burning placebo"
such as camphor.<p>

ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND: We have used epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for
pain control for the past 15 years. An analysis of our series of 235 patients
has clarified the value of specific prognostic parameters in the prediction of
successful SCS. METHODS: Patients were followed up for periods ranging from 6
months to 15 years with a mean follow-up of 66 months. The mean age of the 150
men and 85 women in the study was 51.4 years. Indications for SCS included
failed back syndrome (114 patients), peripheral vascular disease (39 patients),
peripheral neuropathy (30 patients), multiple sclerosis (13 patients), reflex
sympathetic dystrophy (13 patients), and other etiologies of chronic
intractable pain (26 patients). RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-nine patients
received permanent devices; 111 (59%) of these patients continue to receive
satisfactory pain relief. Pain attributable to failed back syndrome, reflex
sympathetic dystrophy, peripheral vascular disease of lower limbs, multiple
sclerosis, and peripheral neuropathy responded favorably to spinal cord
stimulation. In contrast, paraplegic pain, cauda equina syndrome, stump pain,
phantom limb pain, and primary bone and joint disease pain did not respond as
well. Cases of cauda equina injury had promising initial pain relief, but
gradually declined after a few years. After long-term follow-up, 47 of the 111
successfully implanted patients were gainfully employed, compared with 22
patients before implantation. The successful patients reported improvements in
daily living as well as a decrease in analgesic usage. Multipolar stimulation
systems were significantly more reliable (p &lt; 0.001) than unipolar systems.
Complications included hardware malfunction, electrode displacement, infection,
and tolerance. CONCLUSION: Aside from etiologies of pain syndromes as a
prognostic factor, we have identified other parameters of success. In patients
who have undergone previous surgical procedures, the shorter the duration of
time to implantation, the greater the rate of success (p &lt; 0.001). The
diagnosis of failed back syndrome must be considered a confounding factor in
our analysis. Those patients whose pain did not follow a surgical procedure had
better responses to SCS than patients who had multiple surgical procedures
prior to their first implant. The advent of multipolar systems has
significantly improved clinical reliability over unipolar systems. Age, sex,
and laterality of pain did not prove to be of significance.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In an attempt to investigate the correlation between three phase
bone scintigraphy (TPBS) and the clinical manifestation of reflex sympathetic
dystrophy syndrome (RSDS) in the upper extremity of hemiplegia, we collected 30
patients with cerebral vascular accidents (CVA) confirmed by head computed
tomography (infarction or hemorrhage) within 3 months of their CVA event. All
patients received TPBS after admission. Clinical assessment for the development
of the RSDS was done at least 3 months (268 +/- 120 days) after the stroke. The
correlation between the development of RSD and certain clinical variables
(including sex, age, side affected, caused of stroke, and motor stage) were
analyzed. Twelve patients (40%) manifested definite or probable RSDS, as
assessed by Tepperman's criteria, during the follow-up period. Nineteen
patients (63%) exhibited radionuclide evidence of RSDS based on delayed bone
scan criteria performed within 3 months (43 +/- 25 days) of the stroke. The
positive delayed image of TPBS demonstrated a sensitivity = 92%; specificity =
56%; positive predictive value = 58%, and negative predictive value = 91%. The
Kappa statistics for agreement between positive bone scan and RSDS development
was 70% (Kappa = 0.43, p &lt; 0.05). Neither sex, age, side affected, cause of
stroke, or motor stage had a significant correlation with clinical RSDS. In
conclusion, TPBS is a useful screening tool for the development of RSD in
hemiplegic patients. However, the diagnosis of RSDS depends on the clinical
evaluation and that TPBS as an adjunct assessment of RSDS must be interpreted
with caution.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and acute reflex
sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSD) share clinical signs of severe
inflammation, a protracted course, and a similar problem of impaired oxygen
utilization. The difference is that SIRS patients have these signs and symptoms
systemically and are severely ill in the intensive care unit (ICU), whereas
acute RSD patients are in good health and their problems are limited to one
extremity. Both conditions seem to be the result of an exaggerated inflammatory
response. As RSD patients have a healthy contralateral extremity, they may be
their own control in various flux studies. It is hypothesized that this
situation is exquisitely suitable for studying the pathophysiology of severe
inflammatory responses in humans. Only a few patients are required to perform
studies of, for example, oxygen metabolism and cytokine or oxygen radical
production. Assessment methods may be utilized, such as nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy, which cannot easily be performed in ICU patients.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Pinhole SPECT can generate sectional nuclear images of a normal and
morbid ankle and hindfoot with remarkably enhanced resolution by portraying the
topography and pathological alterations in great detail. METHODS: Pinhole SPECT
was performed using a commercially available single-head, rotating gamma camera
system by replacing the parallel-hole collimator used for planar SPECT with a
pinhole collimator. The images were reconstructed in the same way as in planar
SPECT by using the filtered back-projection algorithm and a Butterworth filter.
First, we compared the scan resolution between the planar and pinhole SPECT
images of a thyroid phantom and a normal ankle and hindfoot by working out
pinhole SPECT anatomy with CT validation. Second, the clinical usefulness was
assessed in one case each of fracture, reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome
and rheumatoid arthritis of the ankle with radiographic correlation. The
resolution of the pinhole SPECT and planar pinhole images was compared for
these diseases. RESULTS: The resolution of the pinhole SPECT of a thyroid
phantom and of a normal ankle and hindfoot was significantly enhanced compared
to the planar SPECT although image distortion was seen in the periphery of the
field-of-view. The pinhole SPECT resolution was such that most of the
anatomical landmarks were sharply delineated in the ankle and hindfoot and some
useful diagnostic signs in the diseased ankle were visible. CONCLUSION: Pinhole
SPECT can be performed using a single-head gamma camera system and filtered
back-projection algorithm. It generates sectional scan images of both normal
and morbid ankle and hindfoot with enhanced resolution portraying many
anatomical landmarks and pathological signs in useful detail.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Concepts regarding the nosology, pathophysiology and pathogenesis of
reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome are currently in a state of flux.
Causalgia and reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome are now generally felt to
be on the same continuum and as a result interest for defining criteria for the
latter condition has waned. The pathogenic role of adrenergic sympathetic
activity has been so successfully challenged that the last international
consensus conference judged inappropriate any reference to the sympathetic
system in the terms used to designate these conditions, thus confirming the
position long defended by most French authors. The vasomotor abnormalities may
be due to antidromic release of neuromediators by the endings of polymodal C
fibers. These fibers do not belong to the sympathetic system but often travel
with sympathetic nerves, a characteristic that may explain the efficacy of
sympathetic nerve blocks, although other possibilities exist including a
placebo effect. Also, efferent sympathetic fibers may undergo activation by
nonadrenergic mediators. The mechanisms capable of initiating and perseverating
activation of polymodal C afferents are being actively investigated and have
been found to exhibit similarities with the mechanisms underlying peripheral
and central sensitization of pain-producing afferents. Growth factors, such as
nerve growth factor, may play an important role in causalgia. In "reflex
sympathetic dystrophy syndrome", microcirculatory stasis may contribute to the
initiation or perpetuatation of the disorders. Further work on the nerve supply
to the venular network and on the venoarterial reflex is needed.<p>

ABSTRACT:  To clarify the relations between reflex sympathetic dystrophy
syndrome and moderate phosphate diabetes, we prospectively determined urinary
phosphate excretion parameters (clearance, renal tubular reabsorption of
phosphate and threshold of tubular reabsorption of phosphate) in 37 patients
with reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome before and after treatment with 60
mg of pamidronate (n = 23) and in 35 age- and sex-matched controls. Urinary
phosphate excretion parameters were identical in cases and in controls.
Fourteen of the 23 cases treated by pamidronate were improved after one to two
months. Pamidronate had no effect on phosphate excretion. Four cases versus
only one control had phosphate diabetes (X2 = 0.18). Three of the four cases
with phosphate diabetes failed to respond to pamidronate therapy but improved
under phosphate and 1,25-diOH vitamin D3 therapy.<p>

ABSTRACT:  X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar DPX) was performed before and after
treatment to determine bone mineral content and density, as well as fat-free
mass and body fat, in 28 males and 11 females with a mean age of 37 years who
met Doury's criteria for reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome. Mean disease
duration was eight months. Before treatment, as compared to the unaffected
limb, bone mineral content was decreased by 8.8%, bone mineral density by 9.6%,
and fat-free mass by 6.2%, whereas body fat was increased by 6%. These
differences were largest in those patients with the longest disease durations.
The severity of bone loss was not correlated with the outcome, the severity of
roentgenographic lesions, or whether the patient was evaluated at the warm or
cold stage of the disease process. Study parameters were unchanged after three
months both in patients who were and were not improved. After nine to 12
months, increases in bone and fat-free mass were seen in those patients whose
clinical manifestations had subsided.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Involutional osteoporosis (OP), Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and
Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS) are conditions in which an
increase in bone resorption has been described. It therefore seems logical to
prescribe a potent inhibitor of bone resorption like pamidronate (APD) in a
patient suffering from any of these conditions. In our experience, oral as well
as intravenous APD therapy was able to increase significantly bone mineral
density (BMD) in patients with OP. This increase was more marked at the lumbar
spine than at the proximal femur. With cyclical intermittent APD therapy, a
plateauing effect in the BMD results during the third year appeared. After
weaning from APD therapy, a remanent effect was observed: no loss of bone
apparently occurred for at least two years, but the biological remodeling
parameters re-increased earlier. The protective action on OP fractures has
still to be clearly demonstrated, however. In children with OI, oral APD
therapy has produced a dramatic increase in bone mass, without adversely
interfering with the growth spur. The effect on fracture rate is still
debatable in such a protean condition. Intravenous APD administered daily for
twelve days has provoked a dramatic improvement in patients with long lasting
RSDS which had resisted to various well-accepted therapies. However, this was
an open trial, and these favorable preliminary results should be confirmed in a
double-blind study.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSD) is a neurogenic pain
syndrome that is characterized by pain, vasomotor and dystrohic changes and
often motor impairments. Although the exact pathogenesis of RSD is unknown, for
long the sympathetic nervous system was thought to play a dominant role and
pharmacological and surgical sympathectomies have been a mainstay in treatment
procedures. However, there is growing evidence of a pivotal role of C- and A
delta-fibres in the aetiology of RSD. These fibres subserve a dual
sensory-effector function. Besides the initiation of afferent impulses, they
release neuropeptide mediators that cause a peripheral neurogenic inflammatory
reaction and central neuroplastic reactions. Brachial plexus blockade (BPB)
with local anaesthetic drugs interferes with the conduction of action
potentials along both sympathetic efferents and the somatosensory C- and A
delta-afferents and therefore seems a potential treatment modality in RSD. The
aim of this study was to draw attention on this regional anaesthetic technique
that is not commonly used in RSD. In this study six patients with severe RSD of
an upper extremity in varying stages were treated with BPB in the
multidisciplinary setting of an out-patient rehabilitation clinic with a
follow-up of 12 to 21 months. The study was not placebo controlled. Three
patients responded well. In these cases the treatment interval varied from 3 to
6 months, one case had RSD stage 1 and the two others stage 2. Three patients
showed poor response. In one of these patients the initial effect was good but
due to an infection at the insertion site of the catheter BPB had to be
discontinued. The other two poor-responders had treatment intervals of 7 and 25
months and both had stage 3 RSD. We conclude that there is theoretical and
clinical support to further evaluate the effect of BPB as a treatment modality
in the early stages of RSD.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Although Charcot is remembered above all as an outstanding
neurologist, he also left a lasting imprint on the study of rheumatic diseases,
primarily in two fields. a) He performed a pathologic-nosographic confrontation
based on principles that remain relevant in today's era of imaging techniques.
His vision as a pathologist allowed him to establish links between nonspecific
lesions, which led him to develop a unified concept of chronic rheumatism. At
the same time however, his experience as a clinician gave him a sense of the
nosologic distinctions that are widely accepted today. b) He analyzed
osteoarticular dystrophies associated with neurologic disorders, most notably
tabetic arthropathies with epiphyseal fragmentation and in some instances
spontaneous fractures. In addition, a constellation of alterations of the
synovial membrane, ligaments, and muscles identified in those analyses
foreshadowed today's concept of reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A 37-year-old man developed an ipsilateral headache which fulfilled
the criteria for cluster headache after orbital extenteration because of a
traumatic lesion of the bulb. The headache could be treated successfully by
drugs usually applied in the therapy of cluster headache. Six similar cases of
cluster headache after orbital exenteration could be identified in the
literature suggesting that the eye itself is not necessarily part of the
pathogenesis of cluster headache. We hypothesize that orbital exenteration can
cause cluster headache by lesions of sympathetic structures. Possibly, these
mechanisms are similar to those of sympathetic reflex dystrophy (Sudeck-Leriche
syndrome) causing pain of the limbs.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A 68-year-old man is presented with a reflex sympathetic dystrophy
syndrome (RSDS) of the right ankle diagnosed by radiography, magnetic resonance
imaging and bone scintiscan. Investigations, including blood tests and bone
biopsy, revealed a diagnosis of metabolic acidosis and osteomalacia. These
appeared to result from a ureterosigmoidostomy performed 9 years previously for
a transitional carcinoma of the bladder. Correction of the metabolic acidosis
coincided with improvement in ankle pain. RSDS may be the initial presentation
of osteomalacia, which in turn may be caused by the metabolic acidosis
resulting from a ureterosigmoidostomy.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The comorbidity of eating disorders and reflex sympathetic dystrophy
syndrome in the same patients raises the possibility of a common pathway for
both conditions. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome may be manifesting
itself in those individuals who have sympathetic overdrive. Microtrauma, often
induced by compulsive exercise, and depression may be contributory factors. It
is recommended that: patients with eating disorders who develop pain in an
extremity should be investigated for possible reflex sympathetic dystrophy
syndrome; patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome should be
discouraged from dieting, and eating disorders should be suspected if they
begin to lose weight or are already malnourished.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is the new name for entities
formerly known mostly as Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy and Causalgia. Treatment
of CRPS with either the calcium channel blocker nifedipine or the
alpha-sympathetic blocker phenoxybenzamine was assessed in 59 patients, 12 with
early stages of CRPS, 47 with chronic stage CRPS. In the early stage CRPS
patients, 3 of 5 were cured with nifedipine and 8 of 9 (2 of whom had earlier
received nifedipine) with phenoxybenzamine, for a cure rate of 92% (11 out of
12). In the chronic stage CRPS patients, 10 of 30 were cured with nifedipine;
phenoxybenzamine cured 7 of 17 patients when administered as a first choice and
another 2 of 7 patients who received nifedipine earlier, for a total late stage
success rate of 40% (19 out of 47). The most common side effects necessitating
discontinuing the drug were headaches for nifedipine and orthostatic dizziness,
nausea and diarrhoea for phenoxybenzamine. All male patients on
phenoxybenzamine experienced impotence, but this did not lead to discontinuing
this agent and immediately disappeared after stopping the drug. These results
once again stress the importance of early recognition of CRPS, and treatment
with either of these drugs could be considered as a first choice for early
CRPS, especially because in this series this treatment was not combined with
physical therapy making it very cost-effective. In the chronic stage of CRPS,
treatment with these drugs was much less successful (40%), even though it was
always combined with physical therapy, but it can still be considered, either
as a first choice or when other types of treatment have failed.<p>

ABSTRACT:  OBJECTIVE: The reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS) is a
painful limb disorder, for which a consistently effective treatment has not yet
been identified. The disease is associated with increased bone resorption and
patchy osteoporosis, which might benefit from treatment with bisphosphonates,
powerful inhibitors of bone resorption. METHODS: Twenty patients with RSDS of
foot and hand, were randomly assigned to blind administration of either
alendronate intravenously (Istituto Gentili, Pisa, Italy) 7.5 mg dissolved in
250 ml saline solution or placebo saline infusions daily for three days. Two
weeks later all patients had an identical treatment course with open labelled
alendronate (7.5 mg/day for three days), independent from the results of the
first blind treatment. RESULTS: In the patients treated with blind alendronate
the diminution in spontaneous pain, tenderness, and swelling (circumference of
the affected limb) and the improvement in motion were significantly different
from baseline (p &lt; 0.001), from those observed within the first two weeks in
the control group (p &lt; 0.01), and from week 2 to week 4 (p &lt; 0.01). In
the patients given blind placebo infusions no relevant symptomatic changes were
observed after the first two weeks of follow up, but they responded to the open
alendronate therapy given afterwards. In 12 patients with RSDS of the hand the
ultradistal bone mineral content (BMC) of the affected arm was considerably
lower than that of the controlateral arm (mean (SD)) (426(82) mg/cm versus
688(49)). Six weeks after the beginning of the trial BMC rose by 77(12) mg/cm
(p &lt; 0.001) in the affected arm, but it did not change in the controlateral.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that bisphosphonates should be considered
for the treatment of RSDS, producing consistent and rapid remission of the
disease.<p>

ABSTRACT:  OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the mechanisms of reflex sympathetic
dystrophy, a neuropathic pain syndrome characterized by skin blood flow
abnormalities associated with sympathetic vasoconstrictor and antidromic
vasodilator mechanisms, are solely of peripheral origin or have an additional
spinal component and act exclusively through neural or also involve humoral
pathways. PATIENTS: The 54 patients with unilateral reflex sympathetic
dystrophy were divided into the following three stages according to their
perception of skin temperature in the clinically affected hand: stage I,
stationary warmth sensation; stage II, intermittent warmth and cold sensation;
and stage III, stationary cold sensation. METHODS: Investigation of basal skin
blood flow and vasoconstrictive response to dependency of skin microvessels in
the clinically unaffected hand and the clinically affected hand of patients
with reflex sympathetic dystrophy and the left hand of 16 control subjects.
Microcirculation was investigated at the predominantly neurally controlled
thermoregulatory level (Doppler laser flowmetry) and at the predominantly
humorally controlled nutritive level (capillary microscopy). RESULTS: In the
clinically unaffected hand, at the thermoregulatory level of the
microcirculation: (1) basal skin blood flow was increased at stage I compared
with the control subjects, whereas no differences could be observed at this
stage compared with the clinically affected hand; (2) the vasoconstrictive
response to dependency (defined as skin blood flow at heart level divided by
skin blood flow in the dependent position) was attenuated at stage I compared
with the control subjects, whereas no differences could be observed at this
stage compared with the clinically affected hand; and (3) basal skin blood flow
and the vasoconstrictive response to dependency did not differ from the control
subjects at stages II and III. In the clinically unaffected hand, at the
nutritive level, no differences could be observed at any stage of the syndrome
compared with the control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that
there is a spinal component to microcirculatory abnormalities at stage I of the
reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome that most likely acts through neural
(antidromic vasodilator) mechanisms and that may be initiated by traumatic
excitation of a peripheral nerve on the clinically affected side.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Human parvovirus B19 has been incriminated in the genesis of
hematologic, dermatologic, neurologic, and rheumatic disorders. We report four
cases in which inflammatory rheumatic manifestations developed during the
course of human parvovirus B19 infection documented by the presence of IgM and
IgG antibodies. There was one case each of monoarthritis, oligoarthritis,
polyarthritis, and enthesitis. Three patients had a favorable outcome under
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug therapy, and one developed reflex
sympathetic dystrophy syndrome. In patients with inflammatory rheumatic
manifestations that do not fit any specific diagnosis, a careful family history
can provide evidence suggesting human parvovirus B19 infection, which should be
confirmed by tests for IgM and IgG antibodies.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Patients with a wide variety of rheumatological conditions can be
usefully investigated by nuclear medicine techniques and particularly by bone
scintigraphy. This aspect of nuclear medicine work is increasing and the trend
can be expected to continue. The principal conditions that can be imaged are
sports medicine injuries, osteomyelitis, avascular necrosis, reflex sympathetic
dystrophy syndrome, enthesopathies and bio-mechanical stress lesions,
inflammatory arthropathies, metabolic bone disease and miscellaneous bone
conditions such as costo-chondritis. Single photon emission tomography (SPECT)
has provided new indications for bone scintigraphy such as the evaluation of
spondylolysis and facet syndrome in the spine and of meniscal tears and
ligamental lesions.<p>

ABSTRACT:  OBJECTIVE: To assess the difference in bone mineral density (BMD)
between pathologic and healthy legs in reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome
(RSDS) using a whole body BMD with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).
METHODS: Cross sectional evaluation of BMD in 55 patients with RSDS compared
BMD of the affected and the healthy limb with 121 controls. Followup was
performed on 21 patients treated with intravenous pamidronate. RESULTS: In the
cross sectional study, BMD was reduced in the dystrophic affected extremities
and this reduction correlated with the duration of evolution of the disease. In
the longitudinal study, BMD remained stable in patients treated with
pamidronate. CONCLUSION: The cross sectional study confirms that DEXA is not a
diagnostic tool. The longitudinal study confirms DEXA is accurate,
nontraumatic, rapid, and safe for longterm quantitative assessment of
unilateral bone loss caused by lower limb RSDS.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The unusual case of reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome caused by
an acute attack of gout is reported. The syndrome, involving the left ankle and
hindfoot, developed twelve days after a classical gouty attack involving the
first metatarso-phalangeal joint of the same foot. Diagnosis was based on X-ray
and scintigraphic and MRI changes A prompt clinical remission was achieved with
a short course of i.v. clodronate.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS) is a well-defined
entity, caused by many clinical conditions, leading to pain, stiffness, and
vasomotor changes in the affected region. In this case, a 49-year-old man
presented with a history of right foot pain secondary to a fall. Plain
radiographs did not reveal any fractures or bony fusions. Upon follow-up, a
history consistent with that found in RSDS was given. Radiographs at 7 and 11
weeks revealed increasing osteopenia, lytic lesions, and absent joint spaces in
the first through third metatarsocuneiform articulations suggesting ankylosis.
Other possible causes of ankylosis, including infection, inflammatory and
metabolic conditions, were excluded.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS) is clinically
characterized by pain and edema of one or more extremities, trophic skin
changes and vasomotor instability. Although the pathogenesis is unknown, it
could be caused by an abnormal reflex of the sympathetic nervous system.
Different studies haven't yet confirmed the classical division in three
clinical phases (warm, of vasomotor instability and cold). Barbiturates are the
precipitating event in 10-30% of cases. We describe the clinical features of a
patient with RSDS associated with phenobarbital who needed corticosteroid
treatment. The Technetium diphosphate bone scan (Tc 99m DPD) is very useful
because there is an increased radionuclide uptake in the involved areas during
the early phases of the disease and precedes in some weeks the radiologic
signs. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) may be useful because of the early
signs it shows. The patient may develop contractures and atrophy of the
involved extremities in spite of the indispensable withdrawal of the drug.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Patients suffering from a spinal cord injury often present with a
pain syndrome. Although the reflex sympathetic syndrome is a common diagnosis
in some forms of neurological disease such as patients with a stroke, it is
less frequent in those with a spinal lesion. The authors report eight patients
with reflex sympathetic dystrophy who had a spinal cord injury. The diagnosis
and treatment are discussed along with a review of literature.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A patient suffering from acute smoke inhalation also had a long
medical history that included reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome of the left
foot and ankle. The entire foot and ankle were tender and cool to palpation;
range of motion was severely reduced. She was referred for hyperbaric oxygen
therapy, and 15 min into the the first treatment (46 min at 60 fsw) she
reported a lessening of the pain in her foot; moreover, the foot was less
cyanotic and warmer to the touch. Subsequent treatments continued to improve
her conditions and for longer periods of time.<p>

ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was designed to investigate the
correlation between reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS) in hemiplegic
patients and spontaneous electromyographic (EMG) activity, as well as to
determine the predictive value of spontaneous EMG activity in early diagnosis
of RSDS. METHODS: An EMG and nerve conduction velocity study of the weak upper
limb was conducted on 70 hemiplegic patients at 3 to 4 weeks after
cerebrovascular disease (either cerebral hemorrhage or infarction). Clinical
assessment for development of the RSDS was done during the following 6 months.
The correlation of RSDS development with the presence of spontaneous EMG
activity and certain clinical parameters (including sex, age, side affected,
cause of stroke, sensory impairment, spasticity, and shoulder subluxation) was
analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Of the 46 patients who exhibited spontaneous
activity, 30 (65%) developed clinical RSDS in their hemiplegic upper extremity,
whereas only 1 (4%) of the other 24 patients with no spontaneous EMG activity
developed clinical RSDS within 6 months after the onset of hemiplegia (P &lt;
.001). The correlation of RSDS development with the presence of shoulder
subluxation and sensory impairment in the hemiplegic side was statistically
significant. Neither age, sex, severity of spasticity, nor etiology of stroke
had a significant correlation with the development of clinical RSDS.
CONCLUSIONS: There is significant correlation between the presence of
spontaneous EMG activity and the development of clinical RSDS in the hemiplegic
upper extremity after stroke. It is concluded that spontaneous EMG activity in
the hemiplegic hands of stroke patients might be a good predictor of the future
development of clinical RSDS.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We describe a patient with swelling and pain in his right hand,
which persisted for 1 year after minimal trauma. We think this represents a
case of "clenched fist syndrome," a conversion disorder with unique somatic
features that is easily mistaken for reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome.
Included is a comparison of other psychological illnesses in which unusual
physical findings involve the hand.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Reflex sympathetic dystrophy or Sudeck's atrophy is a syndrome that
can usually be followed by a traumatic insult. This disorder is accompanied by
signs and symptoms of vasomotor instability, trophic skin changes, and rapid
development of bony demineralization. This report presents a case with reflex
sympathetic dystrophy syndrome secondary to organophosphate intoxication
induced neuropathy. The patient was threated with calcitonin well.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Three patients fulfilling criteria for Sudeck's atrophy (reflex
sympathetic dystrophy syndrome--RSDS) are described and etiological,
pathogenetic and clinical features of the disease are reviewed. RSDS is
associated with a wide variety of precipitating factors, each of whom, often in
concomitance with metabolic diseases and psychiatric disturbances, may cause
the same clinical syndrome, which continues in a "vicious circle" of feed-back
mechanisms, correlated with sympathetic hyperactivity. The symptoms may begin
gradually and the disorder progresses in stages lasting from weeks to months.
The management has not yet been established. Generally, the earlier the
syndrome is recognized, the better the results of treatment will be.
Analgesics, salmon calcitonin and physiokinesitherapy are recommended.
Psychological support is advisable. In more severe patients sympathetic
blockade and surgical sympathectomy may be necessary. The effects of hyperbaric
oxygen treatment must still be assessed.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A study was conducted of 198 clients with reflex sympathetic
dystrophy syndrome (RSDS) to gather demographic and descriptive data related to
the occurrence of skin lesions. Participants ranged in age from 18-78 years,
were predominantly women and represented all three stages of RSDS. Findings
indicated that clients with RSDS develop distinctive skin lesions in addition
to the cutaneous changes described in the literature. Skin lesions occur in the
first and second stages of the syndrome. Skin lesions reportedly worsened in
135 clients (68%) when their pain became more severe, and correspondingly,
seemed to improve as the pain decreased.<p>

ABSTRACT:  1. To investigate the nature of sympathetic dysfunction in the
pathogenesis of reflex sympathetic dystrophy, the microcirculatory
vasoconstrictive responses to dependency were investigated in the skin of the
hand of 76 reflex sympathetic dystrophy patients with unilateral disease by
means of laser Doppler flowmetry (in perfusion units) and capillary microscopy.
The patients were divided into three stages according to their perception of
skin temperature (stage I in the case of a stationary warmth sensation, stage
II in the case of an intermittent warmth and cold sensation, and stage III in
the case of a stationary cold sensation). The vasoconstrictive responses were
induced by lowering of the affected hand. 2. As compared to controls, the
mainly sympathetically mediated vasoconstrictive response at thermoregulatory
level of the skin microcirculation, as measured by laser Doppler flowmetry, was
attenuated at stage I (1.82 versus 1.41, P &lt; 0.05), stage II (1.82 versus
1.09, P &lt; 0.0001) and stage III (1.82 versus 1.14, P &lt; 0.01), suggesting
the involvement of sympathetic denervation at all stages of the reflex
sympathetic dystrophy syndrome. This sympathetic denervation may also account
for the observed increase in thermoregulatory skin blood flow at stage I as
compared to controls (152 versus 81, P &lt; 0.01). 3. Since sympathetic
denervation has been reported to cause increased sensitivity of vascular
structures to catecholamines, the decrease in thermoregulatory skin blood flow
at stages II (54 versus 81, P &lt; 0.05) and III (31 versus 81, P &lt; 0.05),
both as compared to controls, may result from hypersensitivity to
catecholamines of skin microvessels. 4. The sympathetically independent
vasoconstrictive response at the nutritive level of skin microcirculation, as
measured by capillary microscopy, was impaired only at stage III as compared to
controls (1.04 versus 2.06, P &lt; 0.05). This divergence in microvascular
reactivity upon dependency of the nutritive and thermoregulatory subsystems
also supports the hypothesis of sympathetic dysfunction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

ABSTRACT:  A comparative study of the effects of sympathetic blockade by
stellate ganglion block (SGB) and intravenous phentolamine infusion (PhI) was
carried out in 24 patients with presumed sympathetically maintained pain of an
upper extremity. A total of 15 SGBs and 16 PhIs were performed, with seven
patients undergoing both procedures. All patients developed a Horner's syndrome
with SGB and nasal stuffiness and cardiovascular changes with PhI. Similar pain
relief was obtained with SGB and PhI in six of the seven who underwent both
procedures. Pre-procedure patient characteristics including age, sex, duration
of pain, historical and physical examination features suggestive of the reflex
sympathetic dystrophy syndrome, and sensory disturbances such as allodynia and
hyperpathia did not predict pain relief from either procedure. Changes in skin
temperature following the sympatholytic procedure did not correlate with pain
relief. For PhI, pain relief correlated with the magnitude of decrease in
systolic blood pressure. After SGB, changes in quantitative thermal sensory
testing (QST) suggestive of a partial deficit in thermal sensation correlated
with pain relief. In 20 normal controls, water bath immersion to cool the hand
passively by 7 degrees C and warm the hand passively by 4 degrees C had small
and selective effects on thermal QST thresholds, but did not produce a general
impairment in thermal sensation. In conclusion, the diagnosis of
sympathetically maintained pain based on the history and physical examination
alone cannot be made with confidence and therefore a sympatholytic procedure is
necessary. When SGB produces pain relief but PhI does not, systemic absorption
of local anaesthetic and/or sensory blockade by spread to somatic nerves may be
the reason. Thus, PhI appears to be a less sensitive but more specific test
than SGB. These two procedures provide complementary information and both may
be needed to establish the diagnosis of sympathetically maintained pain.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome is a multi-symptom,
multi-system syndrome which affects all age groups with the common, overriding
complaint of severe, unrelenting, burning pain. Affecting millions worldwide,
the illness trajectory is poorly understood. A large longitudinal patient study
has yielded important preliminary findings, which have implications for nurses
caring for a variety of patients in pain.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Fracture non-union in the pediatric population may span the age
range from childhood to adolescence. Fracture non-union in children and
adolescents is often due to an underlying cause such as affliction with
neurofibromatosis or osteogenesis imperfecta. Although less commonly seen,
non-union may occur in the otherwise healthy pediatric population. We report
three cases of fracture non-union of the distal end of the fibula in the
pediatric age group. All three were characterized by persistent local pain and
tenderness following injury with radiographic evidence of fracture non-union.
All three had undergone conservative treatment with extended periods of
immobilization. Following surgery, all three had marked improvement of their
local symptomatology. One patient's course was complicated by reflex
sympathetic dystrophy syndrome. In two patients, resection of the un-united
fragment at the distal fibula resulted in marked relief from pain without any
increase in ankle instability. We postulate that the fracture non-union
resulted in a fibrotic reaction that was so extensive that ankle stability was
maintained even after removal of the fracture fragment.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Stress fractures are exceptional in patients with reflex sympathetic
dystrophy syndrome, even when bone loss is severe. We report a case of stress
fracture of the navicular bone documented by magnetic resonance imaging.
Recurrence of localized pain in patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy
syndrome suggests either a relapse of the syndrome or a bony fissure. Magnetic
resonance imaging can provide early differentiation of these two conditions.<p>

ABSTRACT:  OBJECTIVE. To look for asymptomatic thermoregulatory abnormalities
in the noninvolved limbs in patients with well established reflex sympathetic
dystrophy syndrome (RSDS). The study was prompted by the observation of
development of severe upper limb Raynaud's phenomenon in a young woman with a
history of RSDS affecting both lower limbs. METHODS. Eleven patients and 11 age
and sex matched control subjects underwent a standard thermal stress test: cold
water immersion of a hand unaffected by RSDS in water at 15 degrees C for one
min. All controls had had injuries uncomplicated by RSDS. RESULTS. Lag time
(the lag phase between the end of the cold challenge and the onset of
rewarming) was significantly increased (p &lt; 0.01) in the patient group
(median 5.67 min, range 0.50 to &gt; 15) compared to the control group (median
0.50 min, range 0.50 to 12.92). The median maximum temperature recovery was
lower in the patient group (81.6%, range 0 to 170.4) than in the control group
(119.3%, range 49.1 to 153.1). CONCLUSION. Our findings support an association
between RSDS and a generalized abnormal response to cold challenge. Further
studies are required to examine the temporal relationship underlying this.
Early screening for thermoregulatory dysfunction of patients after fractures
might allow identification of patients at risk of developing RSDS.<p>
