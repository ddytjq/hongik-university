<p>evolution - any change in a population's allele frequencies over time
<p>Pretty simple, isn't it? It's hard to believe all the fuss that's been
caused over such a simple concept. Of course the controversy isn't over
the fact that some genes become more common in organisms over time (and
others become less common), it is due to the inferred long range consequences
of these changes. The real controversy is over the concept of common ancestry
(that all life on earth is descended from a single species). These pages
contain a little bit of the evidence for evolution.

Selection</font></font></b></center>

<p>Charles Darwin didn't invent the idea of evolution - that was around
before he was born. He simply proposed a mechanism for evolution and provided
evidence for evolution and the idea that many&nbsp; widely divergent organisms
shared common ancestry. The mechanism Darwin proposed to explain evolution
was natural selection. Here are a list of the conditions Darwin thought
were required for evolution by natural selection:
<p>1. All organisms produce far more offspring than can survive to adulthood
and reproduce. This means that many of those offspring will die without
reproduction.
<br>2. Organisms vary in many ways, and much of that variation is heritable
- that is, variations that exist in the parents are passed on to the offspring.
<br>3. Some of those heritable, variable traits affect an organism's fitness
- its ability to survive to reproductive maturity.
<br>4.(This is the kicker.) Those traits that increase an organism's fitness
will tend to be passed on to the organism's offspring and to subsequent
generations.
<p>What Darwin realized was that this tendency of organisms to increase
in fitness by the increase of certain traits would lead to divergences
in the characteristics of the offspring. Eventually, as some groups of
offspring adapted to slightly different environments (than other groups),
speciation would occur. Hence, <a href="http://www.literature.org/Works/Charles-Darwin/origin/">The
Origin of Species</a>.
<p>Of course, Darwin didn't know beans about genetics - he only recognized
heritable variations - he didn't have any idea of what was behind the heredity.&nbsp;
But now we know that heritable traits are ultimately controlled by genes.
Which brings us back to our definition of evolution - any change in a population's
allele frequencies over time.
<p>Even if you reject evolution, do you see the logic of how populations
will become different from each other over time if there is variability
in fitness characteristics?
