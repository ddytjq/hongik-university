<P align="left"><font size="3"><b>The traditional approach</b>, to answer
an analytical question usually involves 3<sup>nth</sup> steps: 1) Preparative
isolation of the unknown, 2) Subjecting the unknown to a battery of analytical
tests. 3) Re-isolation of the unknown after the initial isolate is used
up.&nbsp;&nbsp; The preparative isolation step in a conventional characterization
can take two to four weeks of precious lab time.&nbsp; In the conventional characterization,
step two is often short lived as the small amount of the unknown is too soon
consumed.&nbsp; The second step is followed by endless cycles of separation and collection of the minute
precious unknown.&nbsp; The obvious but often overlooked solution is to isolate
a large amount of the unknown, but this is not always possible due to the
unknowns rarity.&nbsp; The natural question arises, how much unknown is needed
to answer the analytical query, &quot;What the heck is this stuff?&quot;&nbsp; Since the substance is often unknown or only partially know this question
is unanswerable.&nbsp; The time sink in this type of characterization is the
vicious cycle of isolation, characterization, and the need to re-isolate.&nbsp; More often than not the
substance is difficult to obtain or may not even be re-obtainable.&nbsp; About
this time the director comes in to the lab to ask, &quot;What is the progress
on the project?&nbsp; What shall we tell the project team?&quot;&nbsp; The most common
answer is, &quot;We don't know what it is and we will need to isolate more.&quot;&nbsp;
This tormenting cycle of isolation and attempts at characterization and
re-isolation
is a common theme in many characterizations.&nbsp; Time and money are wasted and
scientific races are often lost and the agony of not meeting ones corporate
or academic goals are the result of the traditional characterization process.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font size="3">How does one answer the question, &quot;What is this stuff?&quot;&nbsp;
The answer is quite simple, a researcher only needs to ask the right questions
in the traditional investigation.&nbsp; The difficult part is knowing which questions
to ask.&nbsp; For a total unknown this is an impossible criteria for success.&nbsp;
The key
is that the researcher needs to approach this problem like a player in a game of
twenty
questions.&nbsp; The first question may be &quot;Is this a protein?&quot;
which maybe answered by a proteolytic digest and a chromatographic analysis.&nbsp;
The second question could be, &quot;What is the amino acid sequence delivered by an
MS/MS fragmentation during an LC/MS run of the proteolytic fragments?&quot;&nbsp;
The truth is that any characterization can be accomplished in a reasonably short time if one is able to ask an unlimited number of questions, it is
exactly like playing the twenty questions game.&nbsp; The problem that the researcher
is faced with is that the minute amount of the unknown preparatively isolated
is too soon consumed using conventional (macro) techniques and the substance runs
out before the questions do.</font></P>

<P align="left"><font size="3">&nbsp;<b>Capillary Chromatography</b> can greatly help you
on the road to characterization success.&nbsp; A typical amount for analysis on
a narrow bore column (2.1mm ID) is 200-1000 pmol, for a 50 kDa protein
this is 10 to 50 µg.&nbsp; For an unknown isolated from a polyacrylimide gel 10
to 50 µg is an impossible amount, even for a process variant 50 µg is significant.&nbsp;
On a narrow bore column one may be able to answer one question with 1000 pmol.&nbsp;
Remember for that 1000 pmol amount this is often a one shot analysis, and
even if you think that you can use 200 pmol per analysis it is often the
case that the refining of that one chromatographic question will take five
injections.&nbsp; With capillary chromatography a chromatographic or LC/MS query
is easily accomplished with just 5 pmol. If one has isolated 1000 pmol of
a process variant, 200 questions can be posed chromatographically or by LC/MS.&nbsp;
With
200 questions in your pocket one can begin to probe the mysterious entity
chemically, enzymatically and chromatographically.&nbsp; Even the most difficult
characterization can be accomplish in this luxurious environment.</font></P>

<P align="left"><b><font size="+1"><a name="Micro Preparative:">Micro-Preparative:</a></font></b></P>

<P align="left"><font size="3">The term micro-preparative at first glance appears to be
an oxymoron, but in actuality micro-preparative is a technique that is one
of the major strengths of capillary chromatography.</font></P>

        <P align="left"><font size="3">Capillary mobile phase flow rates are typically 3 to 8
        µL per minute and peaks widths typically range from 0.5 to 1.5 minutes.&nbsp;
        The low flow rate and high peak concentrations allow for collection of analytes
typically in 5 to 10 µL.&nbsp; The low volume and high peak concentrations help
to defeat absorptive losses.&nbsp; Absorptive losses to large surface areas is
one of the major hurdles in micro characterization.&nbsp; In a micro-preparative
        fashion, amounts as large as
1 nmol can be loaded onto a 320 micron ID capillary column for concentration and then
eluted in 5 to 10 µLs.&nbsp; A similar purification on a standard column may result
in a collection volume ranging from 0.2 mL to 1 mL.&nbsp; A significant portion
of 1 nmol of a sticky protein or small molecule may be lost in the latter
purification.&nbsp; In addition the 1 ml volume may require an additional manipulation
to ready the unknown for further studies.&nbsp; After a micro preparative
        collection tiny aliquots, (0.5 µL), can be manipulated without need for
        concentration or </font><font size="3">lyophiliz</font><font size="3">ation
        and can be taken directly to the next analysis either through dilution
        or directly, saving time and material.</font></P>

        <P align="left"><font size="3">Proteome studies have gained prominence
        recently as we enter the &quot;post genome era&quot;.&nbsp; The
        identification of silver stained protein spots from 2D gels using mass
        spectrometry has been the method of choice throughout the '90s and most
        likely will continue to be a popular method for some time.&nbsp; In
        addition the importance in the characterization of post-translational
        modifications has also be recognized.&nbsp;
        With a 2D gel one can separate as many as 2000 proteins
in a single run.&nbsp; The one downside to the 2D separation technique is the ultimate
capacity of the gel.&nbsp; Only high µg amounts of material can be loaded onto the
        gel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Individual spots from 2D gels maybe contain between 50
        fmol to 2
pmols of protein.&nbsp; 50 fmol of protein
embedded in gel presents the the proteome investigator with a real challenge.&nbsp;
        Many have turned to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to make these
        identifications.&nbsp; Others have realized that any co-migration of
        proteins in a spot will confound protein identification when using
        MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprinting.&nbsp; In an attempt to get around
        this limitation&nbsp; MALDI-TOF operators have used PSD (post source
        decay) and have identified proteins from peptide fragment spectra.&nbsp;
        PSD is a technique that&nbsp; is not easily automated.&nbsp; Some of the
        best labs have turned to capillary chromatography and nano-electrospray
        where peptides are separated chromatographically and identified in an
        automated fashion using ion trap or triple quadrupole type mass
        spectrometers.&nbsp; Very low fmol amounts are routinely identified on
        100 µm ID reverse phase capillary columns.&nbsp;</font></P>

<P align="left"><font size="3">Most researchers perform <a href="http://www.donatello.ucsf.edu/ingel.html"> in-gel trypsin digestion</a>
and LC/MS, MALDI or N-terminal sequencing analysis to identify proteins from 2D
gels.&nbsp; As an alternative to in-gel digestion an <a href="onblotdigest.htm">on-blot
digestion</a> can be performed after an electroblot procedure. On-blot digestion
is often performed if special visualization (western analysis) are required,
also if the gel is to be shipped to a collaborator electroblots are often more convenient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></P>

<P align="left"><b><font size="+1"><a name="LC/MS:">LC/MS:</a></font></b></P>

<P align="left">In the middle days of&nbsp; electrospray (late '80s to the early
'90s) capillary HPLC enjoyed a burst of activity since most LC/MS systems in
that period functioned optimally between 2 and 15 µL/min.&nbsp; This was a flow
rate that suited both capillary HPLC and mass spectrometers very well.&nbsp;
Since mass spectrometers are concentration-dependant detectors the increased
peak concentrations gave mass spectrometers more than just a suitable flow rate
for LC/MS analysis.&nbsp; Over the past ten years capillary HPLC mass
spectrometry has grown to be the technique of choice for characterizing samples
at low abundance.</P>
