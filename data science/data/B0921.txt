      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. The minimum initial 
        investment in this issue is &pound;1000.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Withdrawals may 
        be made by giving 90 days notice in writing or on demand subject to the 
        loss of 90 days interest, calculated on the amount of the withdrawal at 
        the rate of interest which the account was earning immediately prior to 
        the withdrawal. This requirement shall be waived where the balance remaining 
        on the account is &pound;10,000 or more after the withdrawal. An adjustment 
        to the capital balance will be made if the interest earned from the last 
        interest payment date to the withdrawal date is insufficient to cover 
        the whole amount of the interest penalty.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A notice of intended 
        withdrawal will be deemed to have lapsed if the withdrawal has not been 
        made within 14 days of the date specified.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Withdrawals are 
        subject to the Society's Rules and normal branch limits .</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. Rates of interest 
        on these shares may vary from time to time. The Society will only reduce 
        the rate of interest for one or more of the following reasons:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(i) because the Society 
        needs to reduce costs, to enable it to reduce interest rates payable to 
        it by its current and new borrowers or otherwise to maintain and develop 
        the Society's lending business;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(ii) because the Society's 
        administrative costs and charges have increased or the Society reasonably 
        believes they are likely to do so in the near future;<br>
        <br>
        (iii) because the cost to the Society of borrowing funds has increased 
        or the Society reasonably believes it is likely to do so in the near future;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(iv) because the Society 
        needs to reduce a rate or rates of interest payable by it in order to 
        achieve and maintain prudent levels of liquidity, profitability and/or 
        financial strength having regard to current economic circumstances and 
        the Society's expectations of future economic trends.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Any variation will 
        be publicised in the Society's offices and will be advertised in selected 
        newspapers, as advised in the leaflet &quot;Guide to Savings&quot;.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. Interest will be 
        paid annually on 31 January and will be paid in accordance with the investors 
        instructions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. The terms and conditions 
        of these shares may be varied at any time by the Society by giving not 
        less than 120 days prior written notice to the investor. </font></p>
