[This file is intended to be a summary or an extended abstract.   It assumes that you're somewhat familiar with the "lingo" and is basically a condensed version of Essay #3.   There is a "by the numbers" quick derivation of a model other than the conventional open-flat-closed Friedmann models.   This model is already in the cosmological inventory, but is one of the more esoteric ones<strong>:</strong> the FRW (Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) metric.  The main series of essays simply fill in the details of the overlooked model derived here.]

<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Let's begin with <strong>any</strong> elastic structure expanding according to the Hubble parameter, H (so many km/sec/mpc).   There are a few broad characteristics of this structure we can determine, provided we know just one other constant - c, the speed of light (300,000 km/sec).   What we know <strong>for sure</strong> is: (1) the "age" of the structure is 1/H (in seconds),  (2) the distance to the collapsed receding site is c/H, and (3) the collapsed receding t = 0 position (i.e., the singularity) will be receding at c.

</blockquote>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>So far, we haven't imposed <strong>any</strong> restrictions on the <strong>type</strong> of geometry in which this expansion can occur.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>OK, let's add one<strong>:</strong> the elastic structure is a spherical surface expanding in (x,y,z,t).  Our light geodesics are confined to the surface (A = 4<font face=symbol>p</font>r<sup>2</sup>, when r = constant) but the global expansion of everything relative to the collapsed site - the de facto center - occurs along the radius at right angles to the surface (V = 4<font face=symbol>p</font>r<sup>3</sup>/3, when r = constant).

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>But (1) the "age" of the spherical surface is <strong>still</strong> 1/H, (2) by looking "round and round" an ever smaller spherical surface, we <strong>still</strong>  look toward the collapsed receding site at c/H light years away, and (3) the collapsed site - the de facto center - is <strong>still</strong> receding at c. 
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Even though we'll never quite see the collapsed site (because it's dimensionless and receding at the speed of light), if we <strong>could</strong>, our positively curved geodesics (on A) and all positions on the surface (whose global expansion is confined to the radius in V) would reach the collapsed site at the same time, when t = 0, but by different routes<strong>:</strong> our geodesics get there along the shrinking circumference in A, the positions (or "loci") get there along the shrinking radius in V.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>OK, you say, that makes sense<strong>...</strong>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Next question<strong>:</strong> as we look out along the surface back in time, is there <strong>any other geometry</strong> in which our geodesics <strong>and</strong> positions (loci) reach the collapsed site at the same instant, when t = 0?   For example, could we substract the z term and still have this happen on the extant geometric structure?   Remember<strong>:</strong> we need a model in which our light geodesics <strong>and</strong> all loci reach the collapsed site precisely when t = 0 as time is reversed.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>If our alternate model doesn't do this, it's no good.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Obviously the conventional open-flat-closed Friedmann models assume that our light geodesics and global expansion (relative to the singularity) both occur in the <strong>same</strong> type of (x,y,z,t) space, in the V-type space defined above.   But I have not been able to figure out how our light geodesics and all loci reach the singularity when t = 0 when time is reversed if both are restricted to the same V-type space.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Can you?
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>We're looking toward the singularity at nature's speed limit - the speed of light - and so it's difficult to see how any given position in this space could approach the singularity <strong>along</strong> our light geodesics and arrive there at the same time.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>This is a chink in the armor of Friedmann space, and seems to invalidate the well worn Friedmann models.   I'm convinved we need a model where both our light geodesics and all loci can reach the collapsed receding site at the same time, and they don't seem to be able to do it (without some pretty weird physics) if both are restricted to the <strong>same</strong> space.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>For this reason I don't think the Friedmann models are any good.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Which model <strong>is</strong> good?   What's the <strong>simplest</strong> model which allows our light geodesics and global expansion relative to the singularity to occur in different types of space in such manner that the light geodesics and loci reach the singularity at the same instant when t = 0 as we reverse time?   
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Well this model is already in the cosmological inventory, but it doesn't look like anyone is paying that much attention to it.    It's the FRW - Friedmann-Robertson-Walker - metric, the variation which assumes a spherical surface is "embedded" in higher dimensional space.   (This particular version is simply another name for Riemannian space.)
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>So the behavior we deduced on the spherical surface is projected to occur in space with one higher dimension.   Instead of our light geodesics occurring on a <em>single</em> spherical surface, it now occurs on <em>an infinite number</em> of such surfaces, all behaving exactly the same way and now comprise collectively  the "surface" of the FRW metric.   The global expansion of all loci relative to the singularity does not occur <em>on</em> the surface (though it looks like they do).   Instead their movement is confined to the "interior" of the FRW metric, at right angles to the "surface".   Both the (positively curved) "surface" and the "interior" collapse to zero size as we look back in time toward the singularity in the FRW metric, but the light geodesics and all loci get there along <em>different</em> routes.   
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>It's the geometric difference between the expanding "surface" of a sphere and its "interior", projected into another dimension.   (If that doesn't make sense right now, it will if you read the first three essays.)
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>In my opinion. the FRW metric has the best chance of being the perennial "finite but unbounded" model, and it might be the marginally closed universe which seems permissible in the latest data.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>How do we know this particular FRW model is correct?
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Well if we looked around its shrinking circumference <strong>once</strong> as we looked toward the singularity, it predicts very unsual things will happen near an open "south pole" and this position should occur in deep space.   What we normally experience with increasing distance in normal Euclidean space will be <strong>reversed</strong> if we look toward and even beyond that south pole (= "antipode" in this FRW metric).
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The FRW metric predicts dramatic changes in trend lines in a variety of objects if they straddle an antipode, accompanied by a noticeable "void", a region of space surrounding the antipode where we're not likely to observe much of <em>anything</em>.   And what we <em>do</em> observe in this "void" is very likely to have one or more anomalies.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The existence of an antipode in this particular model of the FRW metric does not depend on certain physical conditions (such as high density in the Friedmann models or a change from expansion to contraction).  It's there because of the way the model defines space topologically.   An antipode is intrinsic in this model of the FRW metric, and if space <strong>were</strong> this way we'd get an antipode even in a zero density universe.   This is quite similar to the way the "south pole" is a counterpoint to the "north pole" on a spherical surface<strong>;</strong> we know this is true provided we have a spherical surface which is completely defined mathematically.

</blockquote>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>There are several intriguing changes in trend lines at around z = 3.5, very good hints for an antipode which, if correct, is most likely to occur in this type of space.   And there seems to be a void which affects a variety of objects, such as quasars, radio sources, and (Lyman-drop) galaxies almost exactly the same way.   
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>I've maintained several essays on this Riemannian space/FRW metric for about 4 1/2 years now <a href="toc.html">right here</A>.
Perhaps the evidence suggesting this alternate FRW metric has not yet reached critical mass.  But I've been watching it for a few years, and it's getting there.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>There has always been a vague intuition favoring a "finite but unbounded" universe - it's still there<strong>!</strong> - and if you've read this far at least you now know the assumption in topology which gives you the most easily derived version of this model.
