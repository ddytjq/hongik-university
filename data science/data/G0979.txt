    <!--/NOEDIT-->The National Weather Service publication <I>Storm
    Data </I>recorded 3,239 deaths and 9,818 injuries from lightning
    strikes between 1959 and 1994. Only flash floods and river floods
    cause more weather-related deaths. But according to Dr. Elisabeth
    Gourbi&egrave;re of the Electricit&eacute; de France, Service
    des Etudes M&eacute;dicales, only 20 percent of lightning victims
    are immediately struck dead. Still, many doctors do not fully
    understand how to treat the injuries of the other 80 <IMG SRC="images/HumanVoltage/lightning_manjpg.jpg"
    WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="250" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"
    hspace="10" vspace="10" ALT="Lightning and Man">percent of lightning
    victims who survive a strike.</P>

    <P>Says Gourbi&egrave;re, &quot;The pathology of lightning, or
    keraunopathy, is known only to a few specialists.&quot;</P>

    <P>Most doctors are more familiar with electrical shocks, such
    as those received by industrial workers when they have an accidental
    run-in with high-voltage equipment. But lightning injuries are
    not the same as electrical shocks. For one thing, the contact
    voltage of a typical industrial electrical shock is 20 to 63
    kilovolts, while a lightning strike delivers about 300 kilovolts.</P>

    <P>Industrial shocks rarely last longer than half a second (500
    milliseconds) because a circuit breaker opens or the person is
    thrown far from the live conductor. Lightning strikes have an
    even shorter duration, only lasting up to a few milliseconds.
    Most of the current from a lightning strike passes over the surface
    of the body in a process called &quot;external flashover.&quot;</P>

    <P>Both industrial shocks and lightning strikes result in deep
    burns at point of contact - for industry the points of contact
    are usually on the upper limbs, hands and wrists, while for lightning
    they are mostly on the head, neck and shoulders. Industrial shock
    victims sometimes exhibit deep tissue destruction along the entire
    current path, while lightning victims&#146; burns seem to center
    at the entry and exit points. Both industrial shock and lightning
    victims may be injured from falling down or being thrown, and
    the leading cause of immediate death for both is cardiac or cardiopulmonary
    arrest.<IMG SRC="images/HumanVoltage/industry.jpg" WIDTH="250"
    HEIGHT="222" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" hspace="10"
    vspace="10"></P>

    <P>If you survive a shock, you still have to deal with the consequences
    of the electrical burns. Industrial shock burns can lead to kidney
    failure, infection, muscle and tissue damage, or amputation.
    Lightning burns are exceptionally life threatening (see box at
    the end of this story).<BR>

     FACE="Arial">: High voltage electrical equipment can cause severe
    shocks and burns slightly similar to those from lightning strikes.</FONT></P>

    <P>Gourbi&egrave;re says that 70 percent of lightning survivors
    experience residual effects, most commonly affecting the brain
    (neuropsychiatric, vision and hearing). These effects can develop
    slowly, only becoming apparent much later.</TD>

    <P>If you'd like to experience a lightning strike, go golfing
    one Sunday in July around 4 p.m. If you're really determined,
    be sure you do it in Florida.</P>

    ALT="Man golfing">Florida has twice as many lightning casualties
    (deaths and injuries combined) as any other state. Most lightning
    casualties occur in the afternoon - two-thirds between noon and
    4 p.m. local standard time with a casualties maximum at 4. Sunday
    has 24% more deaths than other days, followed by Wednesday. Lightning
    reports reach their peak in July.</P>

    <P>Many lightning victims had been walking in an open field or
    swimming before they were struck. Other lightning victims had
    been holding metal objects such as golf clubs, fishing rods,
    hay forks, or umbrellas. But even those not holding metal objects
    are as likely to be struck by lightning as a bronze statue of
    the same size.</P>

    <P>When you hear thunder, you are already within the range where
    the next ground flash may occur. N. Kitagawa of Central Lightning
    Protection, Inc. and A. Sugita and S. Takahashi of Franklin Japan
    determined the average intervals between lightning strikes in
    order to estimate how much time someone has to seek shelter.
    Their news is far from encouraging.</P>

    <P>&quot;It is concluded that there exists no safe time interval
    during which a human is free from direct strikes,&quot; they
    wrote.<IMG SRC="images/HumanVoltage/USA3_blank.jpg" WIDTH="300"

    <P>In an area with a radius of 500 meters (1,640 ft), most of

    Ohio, Michigan, Colorado and Texas.</FONT></P>

    <P>To avoid being struck by lightning, you should seek shelter
    when you hear even the faintest thunder. Some of the best places
    to take refuge are enclosed buildings, or cars and buses (but
    don't touch the metal!). In case there are no safe spaces nearby,
    bend into a crouching position until there is a break in the

    </TABLE>Isolated trees, telephone booths, and open structures
    like gazebos or porches make poor lightning shelters. If there
    is a tall object nearby, move as far away as possible - at least
    2 meters (7 ft). Standing next to tall isolated objects like
    poles or towers makes you vulnerable to secondary discharges
    coming off those objects.</P>

    <P>According to L.G. Byerley III from Lightning Protection Technology
    and W.A. Brooks, R.C. Noggle, and K.L Cummins from Global Atmospherics,
    Inc., the growth of towers in the United States has increased
    the amount of lightning strikes in certain areas. Such towers
    include cellular telephone and wireless communications, radio,
    microwave repeater, VHF communications and water towers.</P>

    <P>The mechanism for how towers attract lightning is not really
    understood. But scientists have known for a long time that towers
    attract more lightning than the undisturbed ground nearby.</P>

    <P>The tale of a family in North Carolina clearly illustrates
    how towers can concentrate lightning strikes. In 1998, a 42 meter
    (138 ft) tall water tower was erected near Murfreesboro, <IMG 
    SRC="images/HumanVoltage/lightning_TowerMissourirev.jpg" WIDTH="144"
    HEIGHT="281" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" hspace="10"
    vspace="10">NC. This tower was about 45 meters away from a farmhouse
    that was situated on a one acre plot in a large open area of
    farmland. The family had lived in the farmhouse for the past
    10 years, and they had never experienced any lightning damage.
    After the tower was erected, 5 separate discharges near the house
    occurred over a period of 5 months, causing the deaths of 2 trees,
    a fire in electrical equipment, complete destruction of all phone
    wiring, and damage to electrical fixtures.<BR>

    Division.</FONT></P>

    <P>Lightning damages have been on the increase in the past 35
    years. Holle's team attributes most of this increase to population
    growth. <I>Storm Data</I> recorded 19,814 property-damage reports
    due to lightning in the United States from 1959-1994. Pennsylvania
    has the largest number of damage reports, while the highest rates
    of damage reports weighted by population are on the plains from
    North Dakota and Oklahoma.</P>

    <P>According to Richard Kithil of the National Lightning Safety
    Institute, most reports of the economic impact of lightning are
    contradictory and underreported. The National Weather Service
    <I>Storm Data </I>figures place the most recent yearly losses
    at $35 million, but the process by which this figure is tabulated
    is open to error. <I>Storm Data </I>collects much of its severe
    weather information from newspaper reports.<IMG SRC="images/HumanVoltage/buildingsrev.jpg"
    WIDTH="168" HEIGHT="148" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"
    hspace="10" vspace="10"> If an incident is not reported in the
    paper or is overlooked by the <I>Storm Data </I>reviewer, it
    may not get into the publication's<I> </I>statistical base.</P>

    <P>Kithil conducted his own study based on insurance reports
    and other sources that keep track of weather damages, and he
    came up with a much larger figure for the annual cost of lightning
    strikes.</P>

    <P>&quot;It seems reasonable to estimate that there may be $4
    to 5 billion in lightning costs and losses each year in the US,&quot;
    said Kithil.</P>

    <P>There are currently several different methods used to keep
    track of lightning strikes, but none of them can be considered
    perfect. Medical reports, for instance, sometimes report &quot;burns&quot;
    as the primary cause of death, with lightning listed as a secondary
    effect. Despite such instances of underreporting, the methods
    used in the United States to track lightning strikes are considered
    to be the best available.</P>

    <P>&quot;We work with people from other countries who wish they
    had what we have,&quot; said Holle.</TD>

    <P>In the contest between people and lightning, lightning wins.
    Although lightning rarely strikes more than one person at a time,
    over the course of a year the damages, deaths and injuries add
    up to make lightning a serious threat. By studying the outcome
    of human-lightning encounters, scientists hope to find more ways
