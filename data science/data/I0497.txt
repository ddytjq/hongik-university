  <tr>
    <td><strong>BRAMHALL<img src="../images/markver1.jpg" alt="Markver1.jpg (12083 bytes)"
    align="right" border="0" width="200" height="305"></strong><p>Mark Weaver is chairman of
    the recently resigned Bramhall FC, where his wife is registered as Club Secretary. </p>
    <p><strong>STOCKPORT COUNTY</strong></p>
    <p>He was employed in some sort of commercial capacity at Stockport County although
    details are sketchy and differ depending on source. He claims to have been Commercial
    Manager while others say he was no more than raffle ticket seller.</p>
    <p><strong>DONCASTER ROVERS</strong></p>
    <p>Mark joined Doncaster as commercial manager for Rovers when Rovers were on the up, a
    year or so after Ken Richardson took charge at Belle Vue.</p>
    <p>He was virtually unknown until Ken became irritated with the councils lack of progress
    over giving him millions for the ground. Ken turned on the fans, the town, the council,
    even the club. </p>
    <p>And thats where Mark Weaver came in. Mark was allegedly paid a large sum of money to
    take the club through a period of sizing down which saw the club relegated from the
    Football League, the decimation of its squad, the lack of ground improvement, the
    eradication of the infamous youth programme and reserve team setup. </p>
    <p>Mark, with no football qualifications or experience sacked manager after manager, gave
    himself the job, and registered himself as a player. He also gave his friends, neighbours
    and colleagues games of football from time to time. Just before leaving he signed several
    of his closest players (also from the Manchester area) long term contracts with the club,
    which are now reputed to be costing Doncaster Rovers £250k to alleviate. He also
    allegedly took the clubs cutlery prior to leaving.</p>
    <p>Probably the worst crime against the supporters is his constant tormenting of the
    supporters through the local media. The Doncaster Star, and ace reporter Steve Hossack,
    steadfastly stuck by the duo of Mark Weaver and Ken Richardson throughout. The only daily
    evening paper in Doncaster never once criticised the regime that almost murdered Doncaster
    Rovers. </p>
    <p>Mark Weaver was the mouthpiece for the club to the paper. He regularly contradicted
    himself week after week. He once said of the last game of the ill-fated relegation to the
    Conference season: &quot;I will not be turning up for the game. It would be like the
    murderer turning up at his victims funeral.&quot;</p>
    <p>He then made an appearance for a period in the first half before leaving under police
    advice.</td>
