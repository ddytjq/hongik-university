HTML=<title> History of Professional Model Frisbee </title> <P>Hello,<P>As one of the self appointed historian of GUTS frisbee I thought Iwouldanswer a few of the question that have appeared on the guts linerecently about the pro disc, its origins and colors.  For those of youwho have not seen it (it really has never been published), SteveTrauger, formerly of the Beer City Exprees, a guts team out of GreenBay, Wisconsin, has written a very thorough Discography of all gutsdiscs.  Using Stencil Johnson's book "Frisbee", Frisbee disc World, andthe GPA newsletters, he has compiled quite a complete list.  In fact thepro list is up to 77 now. (that does not include the disc produced forthe 1994 WUGC in Colchester, England) The list includes any pros,including ones of different color and different stickers.<P>	In the early 50's, Fred Morrison produced the first frisbee.  Threeyears later (1957/1958) Whamo-o produced the first professional model.Fire orange and 109/110 gm with a cupola.  As far as we know these wereused in the IFT all the way through the 60's.  In fact the first discwe have record of, other then the standard pro, is a 1969 mini, with thestick reading "12th Annual Frisbee Tournament, Eagle Harbor.  Anybodygot one of those?  Then in 1970 the blaze orange, mold 10, wasintroduced. ("Goldy Norton brought with him approx. 1000 pro models,""Sports Illustrated", Aug. 1970.)<P><P>	Then probably the most famous of pro guts discs were the yellow, mold15, double gold band, gold hotstamp, with a black and gold "1974 RoseBowl Invitational Flying Disc World Frisbee Championships" label.  Thesewere produced for the World Championship held in Cal., at the Rose Bowl.Back then the winner of the IFT was invited to the Tournament (despitethe fact guts was not offered as a event), where they played aCalifornia all star team.  These disc were then used in the 1975 and1976 IFT's.  And if fact at the time there was a guy (is name escapesme) who claimed he was color blind and could finally see the disc.<P>	During those years the molds 14, 15, and 15/75 were used to produce thepros.  In fact that same number mold was used to produce the pros thatTEAM USA took to Japan and England.  Then in 1978 with the formation ofthe Guts Players Assocition, new disc were produced with a hot stampthat read "Guts Players Association".  Since then there has been maycolored disc produced which includes the hot stamp, GPA.<P>Then in 1981 Wham-0 made a decision to remove the professional modelfrisbee from the open market.  (See my protest article in the GPAnewsletter..1981 v.3) So from then on no one could buy a professionalmodel in any store.  Wham-o tried to solve the problem my saying thattheir new 119gm model (no cupola) was used to play guts.  As we all knowthat was a joke.  But Wham-O did help the GPA by still producing thepros for us and still do to this day.<P>	Over the years their has been many colors and many different labels.Toronto produced numerous colored discs in 1991 for the 1991 Worlds GutsChampionships.  And as mentioned, TEAM USA has had numerous coloreddiscs produced for international competition and trading.  And as Derekmentioned there has been fastbacks produced as a guts disc.  Though theywere never used in competition but for tournament sales.<P>	So you can see there as been a varied and colorful history ofprofessional guts disc.  But over 40 years have produced very littlestructural changes to the pro model and it still lives today.<P>shoot me,<P>buck<P>
