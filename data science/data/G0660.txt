<H1>
Age of the Universe
</H1>

<P>
There are at least 3 ways that the age of the Universe can be estimated.
I will describe
<UL>
<LI>The age of the chemical elements.
<LI>The age of the oldest star clusters.
<LI>The age of the oldest white dwarf stars.
</UL>
</P>
<H2>The Age of the Elements</H2>
<P>
The age of the chemical elements can be estimated using radioactive
decay to determine how old a given mixture of atoms is.  The most
definite ages that can be determined this way are ages since the
solidification of rock samples.
When a rock solidifies, the chemical elements often get separated into
different crystalline grains in the rock.  For example, sodium and
calcium are both common elements, but their chemical behaviours are
quite different, so one usually finds sodium and calcium in different
grains in a differentiated rock.
Rubidium and strontium are heavier elements that behave chemically
much like sodium
and calcium.  Thus rubidium and strontium are usually found in different
grains in a rock.  But Rb-87 decays into Sr-87 with a half-life of
47 billion years.  And there is another isotope of strontium, Sr-86,
which is not produced by any rubidium decay.  The isotope
Sr-87 is called <EM>radiogenic</EM>, because it can be produced by 
radioactive decay, while Sr-86 is non-radiogenic.
The Sr-86 is used to determine what fraction of the Sr-87 was produced
by radioactive decay.  This is done by plotting the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio
versus the Rb-87/Sr-86 ratio.  When a rock is first formed, the
different grains have a wide range of Rb-87/Sr-86 ratios, but the
Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio is the same in all grains because the chemical
processes leading to differentiated grains do not separate isotopes.
After the rock has been solid for several billion years, a fraction
of the Rb-87 will have decayed into Sr-87.  Then the Sr-87/Sr-86
ratio will be larger in grains with a large Rb-87/Sr-86 ratio.
Do a linear fit of
<PRE>
Sr-87/Sr-86 = a + b*(Rb-87/Sr-86)
</PRE>
and then the slope term is given by
<PRE>
b = 2<SUP>x</SUP> - 1
</PRE>
with <EM>x</EM> being the number of half-lives that the rock has been
solid.  See the talk.origins <A
HREF="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/isochron-dating.html">isochrone 
FAQ</A> for more on radioactive dating.
</P>
<P>
When applied to rocks on the surface of the Earth, the oldest rocks are
about 3.8 billion years old.  When applied to meteorites, the oldest
are 4.56 billion years old.  This very well determined age is the age
of the Solar System.  See the talk.origins <A
HREF="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-age-of-earth.html">age of the
Earth FAQ</A> for more on the age of the solar system.
</P>

<P>
When applied to a mixed together and evolving system like the gas in the
Milky Way, no great precision is possible.  One problem is that there is
no chemical separation into grains of different crystals, so the
absolute values of the isotope ratios have to be used instead of the
slopes of a linear fit.  This requires that we know precisely how much
of each isotope was originally present, so an accurate model for element
production is needed.  One isotope pair that has been used is
rhenium and osmium: in particular Re-187 which decays into Os-187 with
a half-life of 40 billion years.  It looks like 15% of the original
Re-187 has decayed, which leads to an age of 8-11 billion years.  But
this is just the mean formation age of the stuff in the Solar System,
and no rhenium or osmium has been made for the last 4.56 billion years.
Thus to use this age to determine the age of the Universe, a model of
when the elements were made is needed.  If all the elements were made in
a burst soon after the Big Bang, then the age of the Universe would
be t<SUB>o</SUB> = 8-11 billion years.
But if the elements are made continuously at a constant rate, then the
mean age of stuff in the Solar System is
<PRE>
(t<SUB>o</SUB> + t<SUB>SS</SUB>)/2 = 8-11 Gyr
</PRE>
which we can solve for the age of the Universe giving
<PRE>
   t<SUB>o</SUB> = 11.5-17.5 Gyr
</PRE>

<H3>Radioactive Dating of an Old Star</H3>

<P>A very interesting paper by Cowan <EM>et al.</EM> (1997, ApJ, 480,
246) discusses the thorium abundance in an old halo star.  Normally it
is not possible to measure the abundance of radioactive isotopes in
other stars because the lines are too weak.  But in CS 22892-052 the
thorium lines can be seen because the iron lines are very weak.
The Th/Eu (Europium) ratio in this star is 0.219 compared to 0.369
in the Solar System now.  Thorium decays with a half-life of 14.05 Gyr,
so the Solar System formed with Th/Eu = 2<SUP>4.6/14.05</SUP>*0.369 = 0.463.
If CS 22892-052 formed with the same Th/Eu ratio it is then 15.2 +/- 3.5
Gyr old.  It is actually probably slightly older because some of the
thorium that would have gone into the Solar System decayed before the
Sun formed, and this correction depends on the nucleosynthesis history 
of the Milky Way.  
Nonetheless, this is still an interesting measure of the age of
the oldest stars that is independent of the main-sequence lifetime
method.

A <A HREF="http://arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9808272">later paper</A> by 
Cowan <EM>et al.</EM> (1999, ApJ, 521, 194) gives 15.6 +/- 4.6 Gyr
for the age based on two stars: CS 22892-052 and HD 115444.

A another star, 
<A HREF="http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2001/pr-02-01.html">
CS 31082-001,</A> shows an age of 12.5 +/- 3 Gyr
based on the decay of U-238 [Cayrel, <EM>et al.</EM> 2001, Nature, 
409, 691-692].  <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0206133">
Wanajo <EM>et al.</EM></A> refine the
predicted U/Th production ratio and get 14.1 +/- 2.5 Gyr for 
the age of this star.

<H2>The Age of the Oldest Star Clusters</H2>
<P>
When stars are burning hydrogen to helium in their cores, they fall on
a single curve in the luminosity-temperature plot known as the H-R
diagram after its inventors, Hertzsprung and Russell.  
This track is known as the main sequence, since most stars are found
there.  Since the
luminosity of a star varies like M<SUP>3</SUP> or 
M<SUP>4</SUP>, the lifetime of a star
on the main sequence varies like t=const*M/L=k/L<SUP>0.7</SUP>.
Thus if you measure the luminosity of the most luminous star
on the main sequence, you get an upper limit for the age of the cluster:
<PRE>
Age < k/L(MS_max)<SUP>0.7</SUP>
</PRE>
This is an upper limit because the absence of stars brighter than the
observed L(MS_max) could be due to no stars being formed in the
appropriate mass range.  But for clusters with thousands of members,
such a gap in the mass function is very unlikely, the age is equal to
k/L(MS_max)<SUP>0.7</SUP>.
<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9509115">
Chaboyer, Demarque, Kernan and Krauss (1996, Science, 271, 957)</A>
apply this
technique to 
<A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap951019.html">globular clusters</A>
and find that the age of the Universe is
greater than 12.07 Gyr with 95% confidence.  They say the age is
proportional to one over the luminosity of the RR Lyra stars which are used
to determine the distances to globular clusters.
<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9605099">Chaboyer (1997)</A>
gives a best estimate of 14.6 +/- 1.7 Gyr for the age of the globular
clusters.
But recent Hipparcos results show that the globular clusters are further
away than previously thought, so their stars are more luminous.
<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9704150">Gratton <EM>et
al.</EM></A> give ages between 8.5 and 13.3 Gyr with 12.1 being most likely,
while <A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9704078">Reid</A> gives
ages between 11 and 13 Gyr, and
<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9706128">Chaboyer <EM>et
al.</EM></A> give 11.5 +/- 1.3 Gyr for the mean age of the oldest
globular clusters.

<H2>The Age of the Oldest White Dwarfs</H2>
<P>
A white dwarf star is an object that is about as heavy as the Sun
but only the radius of the Earth.  The average density of a white dwarf
is a million times denser than water.  White dwarf stars form in the
centers of red giant stars, but are not visible until the envelope of
the red giant is ejected into space.  When this happens the ultraviolet
radiation from the very hot stellar core ionizes the gas and produces a
<A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap960117.html">planetary nebula</A>.  
The envelope of the star continues to move away from
the central core, and eventually the planetary nebula fades to
invisibility, leaving just the very hot core which is now a white
dwarf.  
<A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap950910.html">White dwarf</A>
stars glow just from residual heat.
The oldest white dwarfs will be the coldest and thus the faintest.
By searching for faint white dwarfs, one can estimate the length of time
the oldest white dwarfs have been cooling.
Oswalt, Smith, Wood and Hintzen (1996, Nature, 382, 692)
have done this and get an age of 9.5+1.1-0.8 Gyr
for the disk of the Milky Way.  They estimate an age of the Universe
which is at least 2 Gyr older than the disk, so
<EM>t<SUB>o</SUB> > 11.5 Gyr</EM>.
</P>

<P>
<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0205087">Hansen
et al.</A> have used the HST to measure the
<A HREF="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/2002/10/">
ages of white dwarfs</A> in the globular cluster M4, obtaining 
12.7 +/- 0.7  Gyr.
This implies an age for the Universe of about 13-14 Gyr.
