Frequently Asked Questions:
<P>
<h4>
<font color=#0000ff>
Where do you find cars for the Derby?
<p>
<font color=a700pf>
I look in backyards, behind barns, beside homes.  
<br>
I usually start off asking: Does the car run? Do you want to get rid of it?...
<p>
<font color=#0000ff>
How much do you pay for a car?
<p>
<font color=#a700pf>
I pay $00.00 - $100.00 depending on whether the car runs and  
what kind it is.
<p>
I always start off on the low end and go up.  If the seller wants to much for the car, 
<br>
I tell them I don't have that much and leave.
<p>

How long does it take to get a car ready for the derby?
<p>
<font color=a700pf>
If I had to, I could get a car ready in 1-2 weeks.  
<br>
I normally only run the derby once a year and spend all summer getting the car ready.
<p>
This year I ran in 3 derby's and 1 figure 8.  I spent a lot of time getting ready.
<p>
I already have 4 cars for next year, so maybe I can start this fall and not 
<br>
have to spend as much time next year.
<p>

Do people ever get seriously hurt?
<p>
<font color=a700pf>
I have only witnessed 2 people getting hurt in the derby.  
<p>
One person passed out in the drive's seat. I suspect it was from heat exhaustion.
<p>
The other person had their driver's door come open in the heat.  
<br>
The officials stopped the heat and the driver got out.  
<br>
Another car took off, hit the driver's door, which in turn, hit the driver, knocking him down.  
<p>
One year I had a sore neck the day after the derby, but that was minor.
<p>
This year, I strained a muscle in my arm from holding the steering wheel real hard.
<br>
I was really getting hit hard!  
<p>
I did sprain my ankle once.  My car had quit running in the heat. 
<br>
The officials stopped the race and I jumped out of the car.  
<br>
I jogged accross the mud pit, slipped and fell on my butt.  
<br>
The crowd had a good laugh on that one.  
<br>
I was glad I had a helmet on, so nobody could see how red my face was.
<br>
Luckily, my wife missed the whole thing.
<br>
<p>
<font color=#0000ff>
What do you do with the car afterwards?
<p>
<font color=a700pf>
If the car is still runnable, I'll take it back home and work on it some more.
<br>
If it's down for the count, most derbys have people from salvage yards buying cars.
<br>
The price of scrap steel has really dropped
this year and they were only paying $30.00 - $50.00
