<h1>Fundamental Defensive Skills</h1>

<h2>Footwork</a></h2>

<p>Defense is built from the feet up. Aside from poor conditioning,
improper footwork is the most common cause for weak defense. Conversely, a defender that
can move quickly in front of an offensive dribbler to block progress can quietly and
efficiently shut down that player. Its enjoyable to watch good defensive positioning at
work. Sometimes dribblers are repeatedly herded to the sidelines and forced to pass and
never realize why it keeps happening. Or, offensive players become frustrated because they
are not getting their customary shots and it is simply because the defender won't permit
them to drive to the basket. There is nothing flashy about good, quick footwork. The
defense rarely gets credit for it. The ball handler is usually criticized for not getting
open.</p>

<p>The key is being able to move laterally as quickly and as energy-efficiently as
possible. Make no mistake, footwork is hard work. But done properly, the defense will not
get by without drawing a charging foul. Here are some tips: 

<ol>
  <li>Remember that the primary mission is to simply impede the dribbler's progress. Stealing
    the ball is nice, but has two significant risks. One is drawing a foul. The second is
    lunging out of position which allows the dribbler to get by. If the dribbler can't drive,
    then the only other options are to settle for a less advantageous shot, or give up the
    basketball with a pass.</li>
  <li>Have the players lean forward slightly, knees bent, with weight on the balls of the
    feet. If the body weight is resting on the heels, the tendency is to move backwards. If
    the player is standing too straight, adjustment time will be slow. With the knees bent,
    the muscles are loaded and ready to fire.</li>
  <li>Never cross the feet. Use a slide step. One foot moves in the direction desired, then
    the second slides to meet it, not cross behind or in front of it.</li>
  <li>Eyes should focus on the body - preferably the belly button area. The reason is that the
    dribbler won't go anywhere without the belly button and I have yet to see a good belly
    button fake. If the defender watches the ball or the dribbler's eyes, a good ballhandler
    will be able to misdirect the defense.</li>
  <li>Keep the palms up. When the palms are down, players have a tendency to slap down at the
    ball and draw a foul. The dribble can be disrupted cleanly with the palms up with lower
    risk.</li>
  <li>If the defender is too slow and the offensive player drives by, do not compound the
    problem by reaching out to the side or sticking out a knee or a hip to obstruct the
    dribbler. The result is a foul.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Conditioning suggestions:</strong> 

<ol>
  <li>Build up strength with drills that exercise the lower legs. Daily routines that feature
    hopping front and back, side to side.</li>
  <li>For a short distance, like across the key, have the players slide step from one boundary
    to the other as fast as possible for a timed period.</li>
  <li>Have players zig zag the length of the court using the side step. Be sure they alternate
    the lead foot periodically.</li>
  <li>Match players up one on one. Within a confined lane (~12 feet), have the dribbler
    attempt to get around the defender.</li>
  <li>Have the players play defense with their hands behind their backs using only body
    position to stop the ball.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Anticipation</h2>

<p>Anticipation is a very valuable, though intangible, contribution a
player can offer. Some players are in a reactive mode throughout the game and are
manipulated by the whims of the offense, yet others seem to be able to predict what the
offense is about to do and take advantage of the foresight. Offensive players can be
pretty predictable, after all they have the same objective of scoring that your team does
and there aren't all that many ways to put the ball in the basket (see fundamental
offensive plays).&nbsp; Experienced players have seen certain situations hundreds of times
and should be encouraged to use that experience to force a turnover.</p>

<p>A coach can stimulate anticipation in a couple ways. One is to run a formal defensive
pattern, such as a full court defensive zone press. In that situation, the defense is
taking initiative (at substantial risk) to pressure the offense into predictable solutions
while advancing the ball up the floor. By implementing traps in certain locations and
forcing passes through a limited number of passing lanes, the defense can successfully
gamble.</p>

<p>Another way to predict an opponent's response is to study previous games they have
played. Usually teams run similar plays throughout the season and even over the years. If
you are willing to do the homework, its possible to anticipate a team's movement through
its offensive set and take advantage of them.</span></p>

<h2>Traps</h2>

<p>Defensively, two players may cover a single ball handler. These
situations are called traps. Traps are most effective when the two defenders cover two
sides of the offensive player.</p>

<p>A basic fault is when the two defenders stand side-by-side. When that happens, they're
just a single wide-body. If they gang up front and back, the ball handler turns from one
into the other. Also, when the defenders are side-by-side, there is often indecision when
the ball handler attempts to &quot;split the defenders&quot; by driving between them. If
neither commits to stopping the dribbler, then the offense will effectively eliminate two
players from the defense for a moment while they are behind the ball and guarding no one.</p>

<p>Another important tip is to use the half court line and the out-of-bound perimeter to
inhibit the opponent. If the ball handler is hapless enough to get caught in the corners,
he can be completely surrounded with just two defenders. However, I now teach
that one is enough if the man is caught in the corner - cut off the passing
escapes. Usually, the offensive player
will attempt to pass over the defenders or will force a weak cross-court pass, inviting an
interception.</p>

<p><b>Here are some trapping rules that will help:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Only trap in the back court, like during full court pressing situations.
    You have time to recover when the traps are beaten.</li>
  <li>Trap when the ball handler turns his back to the basket. He won't see the
    second defender coming.</li>
  <li>Do not trap when the ball goes into the extreme corner. The reason is that
    one player should be able contain the ball handler sufficiently to force a
    bad pass. Its more important that all the receivers are covered.</li>
  <li>Do not trap at mid-court. Pressure and pass prevention at mid-court are great, but traps will
    get you into trouble when playing good teams. They will draw two players to
    the ball then pass and you will spend the rest of the possession rotating to
    cover the open man. How may times do you see mid-court traps force a
    turnover? How many times do you see teams draw a double team then pass to an
    open man and get an easy basket? To me the math is simple. I do not advocate
    traps at mid-court, even when you are desperate. Now, that said, will mid-court 
    traps work against experienced players? Yes! But then, everything works against 
    inexperienced players.</li>
</ol>
<p>The better answer is to pressure the ball handler and vigorously protect the
passing lanes. The ball handler is not really under pressure unless there is no
one to pass to. When defenders one pass away from the ball sag back, the
dribbler has an easy escape route, but if his teammates are all covered, he will
make riskier choices. Concentrate on pass denial - it really works. The biggest
danger is back door cuts, so you need to have players two passes from the ball
sag into the key to help.</p>

<h2><a name="Shot Blocking">Shot Blocking</a></h2>

<p>Shot blocking is the last line of defense. All else has failed. The
defense did not induce a turnover and the offense has achieved the chance to shoot. At
this point, the ensuing result is literally in the hands of the shooter. Will he/she make
the shot or not? The defensive player must make a critical decision in this situation. The
important question is - how likely is this particular shot to go in the basket? The answer
depends upon the difficulty of the shot for the player shooting the ball. Difficulty
factors include shot location, execution, defensive presence, fatigue, emotional pressure,
shooter talent and experience taking this shot. If the shot is very difficult or poorly
executed, the defensive priority is not to block the shot, but to position for a rebound
because the shot will probably miss. Do not bail out the foolish shooter with a personal
foul. If the shot is well executed and in a good location, again - do not foul. Most
shooters make less than 50% of their shots from the floor, even in practice. Only when the
defensive advantage is great, i.e. short shooter vs tall/jumper defender, should the block
be attempted.</p>

<p>Advanced players will improve their shot blocking abilities and learn to minimize the
risk of a foul. The best block is when the ball is slapped well after the shot, and
directed into defensive possession. Young players are infatuated with rejecting a shot
with a block, and they pay for it continuously. The two most common outcomes of a blocked
shot are a personal foul or the ball is blocked out of bounds. If the ball goes out of
bounds, then the shooter's team retains possession, so what was gained?</p>

<p><strong>The Intimidation Factor</strong> is inherent in big guys. It is enough for them
to just be visible. Use the plane of verticality and force the shooter to make a high
arcing shot at a basket that is hard to see. There is a factor called big brother
ruination. If a older taller player dominates a younger, smaller player in daily one on
one play, the smaller player usually develops bad shooting habits.</p>

<p><strong>Stigmatism of being blocked</strong>. Inexperienced players are embarrassed if
their shot is blocked. They spend hours developing moves that avoid a block attempt.
However, their shooting percentage goes down accordingly. The experienced player realizes
that blocked shots are part of competitive play and only mean that the attempt was made
when the defense had the advantage. The experienced player also knows that the block
attempt is risky for the defender but poses little risk to the shooter. Nonetheless, the
lure of making a big shot blocking play is irresistible to some. Such players may
deliberately choose poor defensive positioning and give the shooter an opportunity, hoping
to block the shot. Deliberately playing poor defense for personal glory is not acceptable.</p>

<p><strong>Sending a Message. </strong>Sometimes a player will drive to the basket and
attempt a lay-up, only to have the shot rejected with great authority and creates a
commotion among the audience and trash talk among the players. The strategy of the mind
game dictates that the shooter will be intimidated and will either forego another attempt
or fail to concentrate on future shots. If your opponent is inexperienced enough to fall
for such antics, then a blocked shot early in the game may have significant value. The
likely outcome, though, is that the habitual shot blocker will spend much of the game on
the bench due to foul trouble.</p>
