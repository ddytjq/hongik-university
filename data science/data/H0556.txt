	<b>Predicting Climate Change in a Complex Biosphere: A Daunting Challenge</b>
</p>

<p>
	<b>John Harte</b>, Distinguished Professor, Energy and Resources Group, University of California, Berkeley
</p>
<p>
Evidence will be presented from ice-core studies and other investigations that there is strong feedback between Earth&#8217;s climate and terrestrial ecosystems.  A consequence of such feedback is that current climate models may be greatly underestimating the magnitude of impending global warming. Quantifying ecosystem-climate interactions is a daunting task, however, confounded by the limited spatial and temporal scale of empirical research in ecology. New approaches and new insights from current research on climate-ecosystem linkages will be presented and implications for climate policy discussed.

	<b>The Scientist in the Crib: How Children Learn and What They Tell Us About the Mind</b>
</p>

<p>
	<b>Alison Gopnik</b>, Dept. of Psychology, University of California at Berkeley
</p>
<p>
In the past 30 years, we have learned more about what young children know and how they learn than we did in the preceding 2,500 years. And this has revolutionised our view of children. For centuries, psychologists and philosophers agreed that babies were the opposite of adults. They were emotional and passive, dominated by perception and incapable of rational thought. John Locke said they were "blank slates", William James thought their lives "a buzzing, blooming confusion". Today, scientists have only recently begun to appreciate just how much even the youngest babies know - and how much and how quickly they learn. There are three elements to this new picture. First, that children know a great deal, literally from the moment they are born. Second, that they are born with extremely powerful learning abilities, more powerful than the most sophisticated computer. And, finally, that grown-ups appear to be "programmed" to unconsciously teach babies and young children just the things they need to know.

	<b>Ninth Annual Stanislaw Ulam Memorial Lectures</b>
</p>
<p>
	<b>Propagation and Purpose:  Parables from Complex Systems and Their Possible Meanings for Our Lives</b>
</p>
<p>
	<b>Doyne Farmer</b>, McKinsey Professor, Santa Fe Institute
</p>
<p>
In 1950 John von Neumann said that "science and technology will shift from a past emphasis on motion, force, and energy to communication, organization, programming, and control."   He was right: This has happened in almost every field of science and engineering, and has had a huge effect on the way we communicate, do business, and even entertain ourselves. But at a more fundamental level, we are slowly gaining a better (if still fragmentary) understanding of how the material properties of the world give rise to its informational properties.  While the universe becomes in one sense more random, it also becomes in another sense more orderly.  Patterns spontaneously emerge, grab energy, rearrange, compete, and perform complex tasks such as prediction of their environments, for the purpose of better propagating themselves through time.  People and their societies are of course just one example. Professor Farmer will argue that viewing ourselves in the context of the broader organizational process of which we are a part can shed a little light on our beliefs and institutions, and our relation to the universe.

	<b>Rice Paddies, Coral Reefs and the Goddess Of The Lake</b>
</p>

<p>
	<b>Stephen Lansing</b>, Dept of Anthropology, University of Arizona
</p>
<p>
Centralized planning has not been good for Indonesia&#8217;s rainforests, rice paddies, and coral reefs.  Thirty years of "Five Year Plans" has left a trail of environmental devastation. Paradoxically, some of the world&#8217;s most successful systems of resource management are found on Indonesian islands like Bali, where for many centuries farmers have cooperated in the management of whole watersheds. Computer simulations of Balinese water temple networks show that they are well adapted to managing a complex ecosystem from the bottom up. But such methods of control are nearly invisible to planners accustomed to a top-down approach. Current models for resource management have been a dismal failure, and there is clearly much to be learned from systems like the Balinese water temples. Ironically, they may vanish just as we are beginning to comprehend them.

	<b>Einstein's Clocks, Poincar&eacute;'s Maps</b>
</p>

<p>
	<b>Peter Galison</b>, Mallinckrodt Professor of the History of Science and of Physics at Harvard University, MacArthur Fellow
</p>
<p>
In the standard picture of the history of special relativity, Einstein's reformulation of simultaneity is considered a quasi-philosophical intervention, a move made possible by his *dis*-connection from the standard physics and technology of the day.  Meanwhile, Einstein's engagement at the Patent Office enters the story as a lowly day job, offering him some technical training but essentially irrelevant to his work on relativity. I argue in this paper that, on the contrary, Einstein's patent work located him squarely in the middle of a wealth of cultural discussions and important patents surrounding the coordination of clocks along railway lines and throughout the cities of central Europe. And Poincare, far from being lost exclusively in the far reaches of mathematics, was at the same time profoundly involved with the use of coordinated clocks for longitude determination.  By understanding the history of coordinated clocks, Einstein's and Poincare's work in relativistic physics shines in a very different light.

	<b>Making Sense of Life</b>
</p>

<p>
	<b>Evelyn Fox Keller</b>, MIT
</p>
<p>
Throughout most of this century, biologists have generally eschewed the possibility, or even the value, of an overarching theory of life. What then does count, and what has counted, as an explanation to workers in the biological sciences? No one can doubt the extraordinary advances that have been made over the course of this century in our understanding of vital process. In fact, so dramatic have been these achievements that today, as the century draws to a close, biology is scarcely any closer now than it was a hundred years ago to a unified understanding (or theory) of the nature of life. The models, analogies, and metaphors that have contributed so much to our understanding remain partial. They work to answer some questions while avoiding (even obscuring) others; they satisfy certain needs while failing to address others; in short, they leave the project of making sense of life with an essentially - and perhaps necessarily - mosaic structure.

	<b>Ending Civil Conflicts: Durable Settlements or Wars Without End</b>
</p>

<p>
	<b>Elizabeth Jean Wood</b>, Visiting Research Professor, Santa Fe Institute, Associate Professor of Politics, New York University
</p>
<p>
The specter haunting contemporary civilization is no longer total war but civil war. The number of civil wars taking place in the 1990s was about seven times the number during the 1950s.  The average duration of civil wars has also increased.  In El Salvador and South Africa, longstanding and bitter civil conflicts were durably resolved by negotiation.  But the ongoing conflagrations in Colombia and Angola proved resistant to settlement.  What explains the difference?  Some possible explanations do not appear to resolve this puzzle.  Intervention by the U.S., the U.N., or other third parties, for example, is not necessary, as demonstrated by the resolution of the conflict in South Africa without such intervention.  Nor does it seem sufficient, as the failure of the many attempts by third-parties to push the warring parties in the Middle Eastern and Angolan conflicts to compromise demonstrates.  The end of the Cold War does not explain much:  while some civil wars were soon resolved, others endured.  The presence of ethnic identities does not in itself provide the answer as some wars between parties of different ethnic identities have been resolved while others have not.  In this lecture Wood will draw on several case studies to explore the conditions that foster enduring settlements and those that tend to undermine them.

	<b>"The Scale of the Tree of Life from Molecules and Cells to Whales and Ecosystems"</b>
</p>

<p align="left">
	<b>Geoffrey West</b>, Los Alamos National Laboratory
</p>

<p align="left">
Life is the most complex physical system in the Universe. It is manifested in an extraordinary diversity of forms, functions and behaviors ranging over a remarkable billion trillion fold mass scale from the smallest microbes (mycoplasma) to the largest animals (whales) and plants (sequoias). In spite of this, many of life's most fundamental and seemingly most complex attributes scale with size in a surprisingly simple fashion. The basic idea is that, driven by natural selection, life at all scales is sustained by hierarchical fractal-like branching network systems whose universal characteristics determine many of the generic properties of living organisms. Examples include the macroscopic cardiovascular, respiratory and neural systems of mammals, the interconnectedness of an ecosystem, and the microscopic pathways within mitochondria. Functionally, biological systems are ultimately limited by the rates at which energy, materials and information can be supplied through these networks. This set of lectures will explore and develop these ideas as a unified vision for viewing many phenomena where hierarchical structures have evolved.
