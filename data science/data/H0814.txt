The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke <A HREF="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/patients/Disorder/LEIGHS/LEIGHS.HTM">(NINDS)</A> tells us this about Leigh's necrotizing encephalomyelopathy:
<blockquote>	Leigh's disease is a rare inherited neurometabolic disorder characterized by degeneration of the central nervous system. Symptoms of Leigh's disease, a rapidly progressive disorder, usually begin between the ages of 3 months and 2 years. In most children, the first noticeable signs may be poor sucking ability, loss of head control, and loss of previously acquired motor skills. These symptoms may be accompanied by loss of appetite, vomiting, irritability, continuous crying, and/or seizures. As the disorder progresses, symptoms may also include generalized weakness, lack of muscle tone, and episodes of lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis, the accumulation of lactic acid in the brain, may lead to impairment of respiratory and kidney function. Heart problems may also occur. In rare cases, Leigh's disease may begin during late adolescence or early adulthood. In these cases, the progression of the disease is slower than the classical form.

ABSTRACT:  A 29-month-old female Alaskan husky was presented recumbent,
tetraparetic and in a state of dementia, with blindness and cranial nerve
deficits. The dog's progress was followed for over two months, as the signs
resolved to an non-progressive mild hypermetria with slight proprioceptive
ataxia, a diminished menace response and inability to prehend food. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral cavitation extending from the
thalamus to the medulla, with less pronounced degenerative lesions in the
caudate nucleus, putamen and claustrum. Cerebrospinal fluid lactate and
pyruvate concentrations were in their normal ranges. Necropsy and histological
examination confirmed the MRI findings as well as neuronal degeneration of the
cerebellar cortex in the vermis and degenerative changes in the neocortex at
the depths of the cerebral sulci. In view of the similarity of lesions to
subacute necrotising encephalomyelopathy, known as Leigh's disease in humans, a
tentative diagnosis of a mitochondrial encephalopathy was made.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The T8993G mutation in the mitochondrial DNA adenosine
triphosphatase 6 gene represents an important cause of maternally inherited
Leigh's syndrome. Reported are the clinical findings and mutational loads in
three Portuguese T8993G pedigrees. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction
fragment length polymorphism analyses demonstrated the T8993G mutation in a
high percentage of tissues from all patients (97% +/- 2.3%), but it was less
abundant in the blood from 14 maternal relatives. The disease progressed
severely in the probands but did not have the fatal course reported by others.
To test whether this prolonged course was related to the presence of a
specific, disease-associated haplogroup the origin of the mutational event in
Portugal was traced. Haplotype investigation revealed an independent occurrence
of the mutation in the three probands. These analyses represent the first
molecular characterization of Portuguese patients with Leigh's syndrome.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Different severe disorders of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) have been
described in children, but only the defects with autosomal inheritance are
suitable for prenatal diagnosis. To perform prenatal diagnosis of fatal
infantile COX deficiency a complex approach has been used which combined
determination of the genetic origin of the defect, and detailed analysis of the
function, content and subunit composition of the enzyme in cultured fetal
cells. The tissues and cultured fibroblasts of the patient with Leigh's
syndrome showed a COX deficiency of systemic character. The decrease of COX
activity to 5-11 per cent was accompanied by proportionally decreased content
of the assembled COX enzyme. With the help of transmitochondrial cybrids
derived from patient fibroblasts it was proven that the COX defect was of
nuclear origin. In a successive pregnancy, the function of oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) was analysed in cultured amniocytes by
substrate-stimulated ATP production and COX activity was compared with the
activity of citrate synthase. The amount and composition of OXPHOS complexes
was estimated by two-dimensional (Blue Native/SDS) polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and was verified immunochemically with specific antibodies.
Three independent lines of evidence provided us with reliable data on the
function of COX and OXPHOS in fetal cells which were sufficient to rule out the
expected enzymatic defect within three weeks after amniocentesis.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A T --&gt; G mutation at position 8993 in human mitochondrial DNA is
associated with the syndrome neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa and
with a maternally inherited form of Leigh's syndrome. The mutation substitutes
an arginine for a leucine at amino acid position 156 in ATPase 6, a component
of the F0 portion of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex. Fibroblasts
harboring high levels of the T8993G mutation have decreased ATP synthesis
activity, but do not display any growth defect under standard culture
conditions. Combining the notions that cells with respiratory chain defects
grow poorly in medium containing galactose as the major carbon source, and that
resistance to oligomycin, a mitochondrial inhibitor, is associated with
mutations in the ATPase 6 gene in the same transmembrane domain where the
T8993G amino acid substitution is located, we created selective culture
conditions using galactose and oligomycin that elicited a pathological
phenotype in T8993G cells and that allowed for the rapid selection of wild-type
over T8993G mutant cells. We then generated cytoplasmic hybrid clones
containing heteroplasmic levels of the T8993G mutation, and showed that
selection in galactose-oligomycin caused a significant increase in the fraction
of wild-type molecules (from 16 to 28%) in these cells.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Clinical and biochemical classifications of mitochondrial disorders
have given way to an as yet incomplete genetic classification system based on
alterations of the mitochondrial genome, the nuclear genome, or both. The first
group includes mitochondrial disorders due to specific mutations of
mitochondrial DNA such as the MELAS, MERRF or NARP encephalomyopathies, various
conditions involving deafness (non-syndromic or associated with diabetes),
Leber's optic neuropathy and a small group of cases of maternally transmitted
Leigh's syndrome. All these diseases are transmitted through maternal line.
conditions which are usually sporadic are due to deletion or duplication of
mitochondrial DNA, and give rise to myopathies, with or without
ophthalmoplegia, and to more complex disorders such as Kearns Sayre syndrome
are also included. The second group is composed of all the mitochondrial
disorders in which the nuclear genes which codify sub-units of mitochondrial
DNA contain a genetic defect. This includes most cases of Leigh's syndrome,
Alpers polydystrophies, the myoneurogastrointestinal syndrome, Barth's syndrome
and Friedreich's disease. Amongst the disorders secondary to defects in
communication between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes is a progressive
external ophthalmoplegic form with autosomal dominance which arises secondary
to mutations on chromosomes 3 and 10. Further mitochondrial disorders due to
faults in the relationship between the two genomes will probably be found in
the near future.<p>

ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND: Increasingly, mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are
being considered when investigating the aetiology of neurological diseases in
childhood. However, they are often difficult to predict clinically. METHOD:
Mitochondrial DNA analysis was carried out on 190 children from 1992 to 1996.
Most patients were screened for large scale rearrangements and point mutations
at nucleotide positions 3243, 3271, 8344, and 8993. RESULTS: Mutations were
found in only 15 patients (7.9%) and were either large scale rearrangements
(seven patients) or point mutations at nucleotide position 3243 (eight
patients). Other point mutations were screened for depending on the clinical
picture. The age of symptom onset was significantly older in children with an
mtDNA mutation (mean 7.0 years) compared with children without a mutation (mean
2.8 years). Neither Leigh's syndrome (28 cases) nor severe infantile lactic
acidosis (12 cases) was associated with mtDNA mutation. Only three clinical
features were significantly associated with an mtDNA mutation: progressive
external ophthalmoplegia, myopathy, and pigmentary retinopathy. Family history
was valuable: the point mutation at nucleotide 3243 (but not the large scale
rearrangements) was associated with maternal inheritance; and consanguinity was
not associated with mtDNA mutations. The only investigation that provided
specific evidence of an underlying mtDNA mutation was histochemical staining of
muscle biopsy specimens. The large scale mutations associated with Kearns-Sayre
syndrome and progressive external ophthalmoplegia were found in DNA from muscle
only, not leucocyte DNA; whereas point mutations were found in leucocyte DNA.
CONCLUSIONS: Even among children seen at a neurogenetic referral centre, mtDNA
mutations were very uncommon. Muscle biopsy was the only investigation to
provide evidence of mtDNA abnormality.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Among 80 patients with the clinical and brain imaging
characteristics of Leigh's syndrome, 11 patients had a well-known mutation at
nucleotide position (nt) 8993 in mitochondrial DNA. In addition, three patients
had a T-to-C mutation at nt 9176 which had been described previously in only
two brothers with bilateral striatal necrosis and one patient with Leigh's
syndrome. In our three patients, one had the typical clinical characteristics
of Leigh's syndrome from early infancy, and two had the later onset of
neurological deficits. All had a slowly progressive course and basal ganglia
abnormalities by neuroimaging. As nt 8993 and 9176 are located in the ATPase 6
coding region, altered ATPase function may be one of the enzyme abnormalities
in Leigh's syndrome and other similar conditions with bilateral striatal
necrosis.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Rapid progress has been made in the identification of mitochondrial
DNA mutations which are typically associated with diseases of the nervous
system and muscle. The well established mitochondrial disorders are maternally
inherited and males and females are equally affected. An exception is Leber's
hereditary optic atrophy (LHON) which is observed much more frequently in males
than in females. There are three common point mutations in LHON which can be
homoplasmic or heteroplasmic. In mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic
acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) most mutations are single base
changes and lie within the tRNA-Leu gene. Point mutations in myoclonic epilepsy
with ragged red fibres (MERRF) usually occur within the tRNA-Lys gene but
mutations of the tRNA-Leu gene are also observed. MELAS and MERRF mutations are
heteroplasmic and there is considerable clinical overlap between these
diseases. Point mutations within the ATPase6 gene result in either neuropathy,
ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) or in Leigh's syndrome. The latter
occurs if the mutation is present in the majority of mitochondria (extreme
heteroplasmy). Finally, mitochondrial DNA deletions are the cause underlying
Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS). Apart from the well-established mitochondrial
diseases, there is increasing evidence that mitochondrial mutations may also
play a role in the neurodegenerative disorders Parkinson, Alzheimer and
Huntington disease. The complex I defect found in Parkinson disease is
especially interesting in this respect. However, no causative mitochondrial
mutation has as yet been established in any of these three common disorders.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in a wide range
of degenerative processes including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ischemic
heart disease, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease and aging. ROS are
generated by mitochondria as the toxic by-products of oxidative
phosphorylation, their energy generating pathway. Genetic inactivation of the
mitochondrial form of superoxide dismutase in mice results in dilated
cardiomyopathy, hepatic lipid accumulation and early neonatal death. We report
that treatment with the superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic Manganese 5, 10, 15,
20-tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP) rescues these Sod2tm1Cje(-/-)
mutant mice from this systemic pathology and dramatically prolongs their
survival. The animals instead develop a pronounced movement disorder
progressing to total debilitation by three weeks of age. Neuropathologic
evaluation reveals a striking spongiform degeneration of the cortex and
specific brain stem nuclei associated with gliosis and intramyelinic
vacuolization similar to that observed in cytotoxic edema and disorders
associated with mitochondrial abnormalities such as Leighs disease and Canavans
disease. We believe that due to the failure of MnTBAP to cross the blood brain
barrier progressive neuropathology is caused by excessive mitochondrial
production of ROS. Consequently, MnTBAP-treated Sod2tm1Cje(-/-) mice may
provide an excellent model for examining the relationship between free radicals
and neurodegenerative diseases and for screening new drugs to treat these
disorders.<p>

ABSTRACT:  PURPOSE: Leigh's syndrome, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder
of infancy and childhood, is clinically characterized mainly by developmental
delay, nervous system dysfunction and respiratory abnormalities such as
aspiration, wheezing, breathing difficulties, gasping, hypoventilation and
apnoea. Acute exacerbation and respiratory failure may follow surgery, general
anaesthesia or intercurrent illnesses. Hyperlecithinemia is variably present.
Histopathological findings include necrosis, vascular proliferation,
astrocytosis and demyelination of several brain areas. We present a
30-month-old patient with Leigh's syndrome anaesthetized for extracorporeal
shockwave lithotripsy, and describe the anaesthetic considerations. CLINICAL
FEATURES: Leigh's syndrome was diagnosed at five months of age based on failure
to thrive, lethargy, hypotonicity, choreo-athetosis and lactic acidaemia, with
basal ganglia hypodense areas demonstrated by brain computerized tomographic
scan. Muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and NADH coenzyme Q oxidoreductase
activity were 25% and 13% of control. No preoperative respiratory symptoms or
signs were present. Preoperative fasting lasted two hours and gastric
aspiration was negative. Anaesthesia was induced with ketamine and midazolam
im, and N2O in oxygen, and maintained with propotol and N2O. No volatile
anaesthetics were used. Intravenous fluids given were 1/2 normal saline and
glucose 5% administered. Besides laryngospasm during anaesthetic induction,
relieved by sublingual succinylcholine injection, the perianaesthetic course
was uneventful. The lungs were mechanically ventilated and lithotripsy was
performed. No adverse sequelae have occurred, and the patient was discharged
one day later. CONCLUSION: Perioperative management of patients with Leigh's
syndrome requires cautious attention to the metabolic, neurological and
respiratory aspects of the disease, and appropriate selection of anaesthetic
drugs.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Primary defects of mitochondrial DNA leading to respiratory chain
dysfunction have been described in association with dystonia, chorea and
parkinsonism. Myoclonus remains the commonest movement disorder associated with
such defects. The genetic basis of Leigh's syndrome, which is frequently
associated with movement disorders, may be mitochondrial or nuclear.
Respiratory chain dysfunction has been identified in Huntington's disease in
addition to Parkinson's disease, but the cause and relationship of this
dysfunction to the pathogenesis of these common disorders is not yet
determined.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Archival material and clinical data of 10 autopsy cases of Leigh's
disease (LS), aged from 44 days to 9 years at death, were reviewed. Development
delay, irregular respiration, feeding difficulty, and abnormal eye signs were
the most common symptoms. Seizures (five of ten cases) were also frequent. In
most patients, the diagnosis of LS was established postmortemly by the presence
of symmetrical spongiform lesions affecting several brain centers at autopsy.
The histologic examination disclosed associated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in
six cases, while fatty infiltration of the hepatocytes was observed in four
cases. Microvesicular degeneration of the renal tubular epithelial cells was
also seen in four cases. Our observations suggest that liver and kidney
involvement is a component of LS and that this rare entity has to be considered
as a polysystematic disorder, able to affect other organs besides the nervous
system and the heart, a fact which has not been emphasized enough in the
existing literature.<p>

ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND: Striatal necrosis has been related to various clinical
syndromes, with acute or chronic progression, and juvenile or late occurrence,
but the most common type is Leigh's encephalopathy. METHODS: Between 1967 and
1995, six out of seven related patients with chronic familial dystonia were
examined. MRIs were performed in four, between 1992-1994. The seven members,
affected over three generations, were the father, three daughters (one
surviving), and three surviving grandsons. RESULTS: The leading symptoms were
gait disorders and dystonia in all, dysarthria in six, verbal and motor
stereotypies in two, and parkinsonian and cerebellar signs in three. Optic
neuropathy was found in three. A frontal lobe syndrome without amnesia occurred
in two. Symptoms occurred between the second and the fifth decade, with
progressive deterioration. Magnetic resonance imaging, performed in four,
showed in the two patients with severe neurological signs diffuse
striatopallidal abnormal hyposignal (comparable with CSF signal) in T1 weighted
images, suggesting extensive necrosis of the striatum and pallidum, associated
with thalamo-subthalamo-rubro-dentato-nigral and substantia innominata
hypersignals in T2 weighted images suggesting gliosis in these respective
areas. The same images were described to a lesser extent in a third patient.
Concentrations of lactate in CSF and serum were normal in three. Muscle biopsy,
performed in four, was shown to be normal. Enzyme histochemistry showed complex
I, III, and IV deficiency in surviving patients. CONCLUSION: This familial
dystonia of chronic progression may be related to basal ganglia necrosis or
gliosis, associated with alterations in the respiratory chain. These metabolic
alterations probably play a part in the pathophysiology of these unusual brain
lesions.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Management of severe spasticity in children is often a difficult
problem. Orally administered medications generally offer limited benefits. This
study examines the value of intrathecally administered baclofen in the
treatment of 19 children with severe spasticity of cerebral origin: eight of
whom sustained brain injury associated with trauma, near drowning, or cardiac
arrest; 10 with cerebral palsy (spastic quadriplegia); and one child with
Leigh's disease. At the time of entry into the study, patients ranged from 4 to
19 years of age, and all were completely dependent on caretakers for activities
of daily living. Children who responded positively to a trial dose of
intrathecal baclofen underwent insertion of a drug delivery system for
continuous infusion. This was followed by a double-blind trial of baclofen or
placebo and follow-up review at 3 and 6 months, and yearly thereafter. Seven
children did not undergo pump implantation because of excess sedation or poor
response. The 12 remaining children have been followed for a period of 1 to 5
years. Favorable responses were present in all 12 children as determined by the
Ashworth Scale, with the greatest benefit being reduction of lower limb tone.
Except in the case of one child who had reduction in lower limb tone that
resulted in difficulty with transfers, the caretakers all reported significant
benefits from intrathecal baclofen, with improvement in muscle tone, behavior,
sitting, and general ease of care being most commonly noted. Central side
effects were seen in some children who received continuous intrathecal baclofen
infusion and included hypotension (two patients), bradycardia (two), apnea or
respiratory depression (two), and sedation (one). During a total of 568 months
of pump operation there were 10 mechanical complications, including two related
to pump or side port failure and eight related to catheter kinks, extrusions,
or dislodgment. Pump pocket effusion occurred in five children and a
cerebrospinal fluid fistula was seen in one child. Local infection occurred in
three children and meningitis in two children. The results demonstrate the
potential value of continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion for treatment of
severe spasticity of cerebral origin. However, this treatment can result in
significant complications and more experience is required before the long-term
benefits can be determined.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A generalized defect of complex IV (cytochrome C oxidase, COX) is
frequently found in subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy (Leigh's
syndrome), the most common mitochondrial disorder in infancy. We previously
demonstrated the nuclear origin of the COX defect in one case, by fusing
nuclear DNA-less cytoplasts derived from normal fibroblasts with mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA)-less transformant fibroblasts derived from a patient with
COX-defective [COX(-)] Leigh's syndrome. The resulting cybrid line showed a
specific and serve COX(-) phenotype. Conversely, in the present study, we
demonstrated that a COX(+) phenotype could be restored in hybrids obtained by
fusing COX(-) transformant fibroblasts of seven additional Leigh's syndrome
patients with mtDNA-less, COX(-) tumor-derived rho degree cells. Both these
results are explained by the presence of a mutation in a nuclear gene. In a
second set of experiments, in order to demonstrate whether COX(-) Leigh's
syndrome is due to a defect in the same gene, or in different genes, we tested
several hybrids derived by fusing our original COX(-) cell line with each of
the remaining seven cell lines. COX activity was evaluated in situ by
histochemical techniques and in cell extracts by a spectrophotometric assay. No
COX complementers were found among the resulting hybrid lines. This result
demonstrates that all our cases were genetically homogeneous, and suggests that
a major nuclear disease locus is associated with several, perhaps most, of the
cases of infantile COX(-) Leigh's syndrome. This information should make it
easier to identify the gene responsible.<p>

ABSTRACT:  AIM: To contribute to the establishment of a rational clinical,
neuroradiological, and molecular approach to neurogenic muscle weakness,
ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) and maternally inherited Leigh's
syndrome (MILS). METHODS AND RESULTS: The T8993G mutation in the mitochondrial
genome was found in several maternal members of six pedigrees, whose clinical
status ranged from no symptoms to severe infantile subacute necrotising
encephalomyelopathy (Leigh's disease). In one case a MELAS-like syndrome was
documented both clinically and neuroradiologically. Relevant genetic features
of the series were anticipation of symptoms through subsequent generations, and
the presence of several cases in whom the mutation apparently occurred recently
or was new. A uniform distribution of the mutation in many tissues was shown in
one patient subjected to necropsy. In general, a good correlation was found
between clinical severity and mutation heteroplasmy in readily accessible
tissues, such as lymphocytes or fibroblasts. By contrast, a consistent
reduction of the mitochondrial ATPase activity, to about half of the normal
values, was found in most of the clinically affected cases, irrespective of the
amount of mutant mitochondrial DNA. CONCLUSIONS: Although the measurement of
ATP hydrolysis in cultured fibroblasts was a reliable, and sometimes
instrumental, means to identify T8993G positive patients, the relation between
the mutation and the oxidative phosphorylation defect is probably very complex,
and its understanding requires more complex biochemical analysis.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Cytochrome c oxidase deficiency is the most common biochemical
defect associated with Leigh's syndrome. The genetic defect responsible for
this deficiency has not been identified in any patient with Leigh's syndrome.
Given that this disorder appears to be inherited as an autosomal recessive
trait, this would suggest prima facie that one of the nuclear DNA-encoded
cytochrome c oxidase subunits is affected. We report the first detailed
sequence analysis of all 10 cytochrome c oxidase nuclear complementary DNAs and
the cytochrome c oxidase mitochondrial genes in a Leigh's syndrome patient with
cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. No pathological mutations were identified in
any of the cytochrome c oxidase structural genes.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Four autopsied cases of myoclonus, ataxia, and epilepsy from 2
separate pedigrees are described. An identical pattern of focal brainstem
lesions was found in all the cases with selective and symmetrical degeneration
of the dentate and second order somatosensory nuclei. The combined clinical and
pathological features did not appear to match any familial disorder previously
described as causing progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Myoclonus epilepsy with
ragged red fibres was excluded on the grounds of paternal inheritance and
negative muscle biopsy findings, but the more acute lesions seen in 1 case are
reminiscent of those found in Leigh's syndrome, and suggest that some other
form of inherited defect of oxidative metabolism may be involved.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A 30 months-old boy developed bilateral nistagmus, tremor, gait
disturbance, hypotonia and disartria. The diagnose of Leigh encephalopathy was
suggested on the basis of clinical, neuroimaging and laboratory findings.
Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at an early stage
revealed bilateral and symmetric lesions in the putamen, appearing as
hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images. Twelve months later a relatively
large hypertense area in the posterior brainstem was observed. At this stage,
the patient exhibited marked deterioration, dystonic manifestations, rigidity
and respiratory disturbances. He died 6 months later for respiratory arrest
during bronconeumonic infection. We believe MRI is a valuable means to allow
assessment of the evolution of the disease.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A 4 1/2-month-old girl suffered from psychomotor retardation,
generalized hypotonia, poor feeding, hyperreflexia, nystagmus, optical atrophy
and choreoathetosis from the age of 3 months. Her blood lactate level was
elevated to 40 mg/dL. Magnetic resonance imaging of her brain showed low T1 and
high T2 signal intensities in the bilateral putamen, thalamus, red nuclei,
substantia nigra, superior and inferior colliculi, cerebral peduncles and
periaqueductal lesions. Muscle histochemistry and electron microscopic
examinations were all normal except for variation in fiber size showing a
myopathic change. An assay of muscle mitochondrial respiratory enzyme
activities revealed a deficiency of NADH-coenzyme Q reductase. Molecular
analysis did not reveal the putative T to G transversion at the nucleotide
8,993 of mitochondrial DNA in muscle biopsies. Leigh's disease was indicated by
the clinical and radiologic manifestations. The patient died at 10 months of
age from pneumonia and respiratory failure. There have been only sporadic
reports of patients with Leigh's disease in Taiwan, and, to our knowledge, this
is the first documented case of a Taiwanese patient with mitochondrial
NADH-coenzyme Q reductase deficiency.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Mitochondria were isolated from skin fibroblast cultures derived
from healthy individuals (controls) and from a group patients with complex I
(NADH-CoQ reductase) deficiency of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The
complex I deficient patients included those with fatal infantile lactic
acidosis (FILA), cardiomyopathy with cataracts (CC), hepatopathy with
tubulopathy (HT), Leigh's disease (LD), cataracts and developmental delay (CD),
and lactic acidemia in the neonatal period followed by mild symptoms (MS).
Production of superoxide radicals, on addition of NADH, were measured using the
luminometric probe lucigenin with isolated fibroblast mitochondrial membranes.
Superoxide production rates were highest with CD and decreased in the order CD
&gt;&gt; MS &gt; LD &gt; control &gt; HT &gt; FILA = CC. The quantity of
Mn-superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), as measured by ELISA techniques, however, was
highest in CC and FILA and lowest in CD. Plots of MnSOD quantity versus
superoxide production showed an inverse relationship for most conditions with
complex I deficiency. We hypothesize that oxygen radical production is
increased when complex I activity is compromised. However, the observed
superoxide production rates are modulated by the variant induction of MnSOD
which decreases the rates, sometimes below those seen in control fibroblast
mitochondria. In turn, we show that the variant induction of MnSOD is most
likely a function of the change in the redox state of the cell experienced
rather than a result of the complex I defect per se.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A novel point mutation in the ND6 subunit of complex I at position
14,459 of the mitochondrial DNA (MTND6*LDY T14459A) was identified as a
candidate mutation for the highly tissue-specific disease. Leber's hereditary
optic neuropathy plus dystonia. Since the MTND6*LDYT14459A mutation was
identified in a single family, other pedigrees with the mutation are needed to
confirm its association with the disease. Clinical, biochemical, and genetic
characterization is reported in two additional pedigrees. Leber's hereditary
optic neuropathy developed in two family members in one pedigree. The daughter
had clinically silent basal ganglia lesions. In a second pedigree, a single
individual presented with childhood-onset generalized dystonia and bilateral
basal ganglia lesions. Patient groups that included individuals with Leigh's
disease, dystonia plus complex neurodegeneration, and Leber's hereditary optic
neuropathy did not harbor the MTND6*LDYT14459A mutation, suggesting that this
mutation displays a high degree of tissue specificity, thus producing a narrow
phenotypic range. These results confirm the association of the MTND6*LDYT14459A
mutation with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and/or dystonia. As the first
genetic abnormality that has been identified to cause generalized dystonia,
this mutation suggests that nuclear DNA or mitochondrial DNA mutations in
oxidative phosphorylation genes are important considerations in the
pathogenesis of dystonia.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy (Leigh's syndrome) is a
rare neurodegenerative disease in the adult. The precise metabolic defect is
unknown, but abnormalities of a mitochondrial enzyme system related to
cytochrome-c oxidase or pyruvate dehydrogenase are described. The clinical
picture usually consists of an altered breathing pattern, oculomotor paralysis,
other signs of cranial nerve dysfunction, ataxia, myoclonic jerks, nystagmus,
generalized seizures, optic atrophy and demyelinating peripheral neuropathy.
Hypopnea leads to CO2-retention with consecutive loss of consciousness
demanding mechanical ventilation. Respiratory failure is the most frequent
cause of death. Here we describe two patients with adult onset Leigh's syndrome
and we discuss the longterm treatment strategies including vitamin B1 and CPAP
mask.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A 22-month-old female presented with developmental delay and
dystonia. The T2 weighted image of the brain MRI showed bilateral symmetrical
high signal lesions over the putamen. An increased serum lactate pyruvate ratio
(29.25) and a positive oral glucose lactate stimulation test were noted.
Electron microscopic examination showed abnormal mitochondrial aggregation with
band cristae in the subsarcolemmal area. These findings were indicative of
clinical Leigh's syndrome. However, unusually the mt DNA analysis showed a
point mutation at the nucleotide position 8344.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The role of imaging in the evaluation of neurodegenerative disorders
is summarized. The primary role of imaging is to exclude potentially treatable
disorders such as meningioma, extracerebral hematoma, Wernicke's disease, and
hypothyroidism. Atrophic changes dominate in the hippocampal region on
Alzheimer's disease versus the anterior, frontal, and temporal lobes in Pick's
disease. Signal hypointensity in the putamen on T2-weighted spin-echo images
favors poorly drug-responsive Parkinson's disease whereas putaminal
hyperintensity is observed with Creutzfeldt-Jacob, Wilson's, and Leigh's
diseases. As our population ages, a thorough understanding of imaging findings
in a geriatric population assumes an increasing importance.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The neuropathological findings in 2 patients with Kearns-Sayre
syndrome and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) rearrangements, one a predominant
deletion and the other a predominant duplication, were remarkably similar,
showing diffuse vacuolation of white matter. There were some of the
pathological features of Leigh's syndrome in the spinal cord of the patient
with a duplication. In the patient with a predominant deletion, rearranged
mtDNA was undetectable in blood, spleen, and testis, and present in highest
amounts in muscle and the brain, but relatively low in cerebellum, reflecting
the ratio seen, albeit in much smaller amounts, in normal aged brains. MtDNA
rearrangements in this patient were largely deletions or deletion dimers;
duplicated mtDNA was present in only trace amounts in some tissues and there
was none in skeletal muscle. The patient with a predominant duplication of
mtDNA had higher amounts of rearranged mtDNA in blood (mainly duplicated) than
muscle (mainly deleted). Correlation of these data with tissue dysfunction is
probably complicated by the replicative behaviour of deleted, duplicated and
normal mtDNA.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Mitochondrial DNA mutations are important causes of movement
disorders and are often associated with basal ganglia degeneration. Leigh's
disease and a form of generalized dystonia are caused by mitochondrial DNA
mutations. Recent biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that some cases of
Parkinson's disease may be caused by oxidative phosphorylation defects.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Defects of the respiratory chain carrying out oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) are the biochemical hallmark of human mitochondrial
disorders. Faulty OXPHOS can be due to mutations in either nuclear or
mitochondrial genes, that are involved in the synthesis of individual
respiratory subunits or in their post-translational control. The most common
mitochondrial disorder of infancy and childhood is Leigh's syndrome, a severe
encephalopathy, often associated with a defect of cytochrome c oxidase (COX).
In order to demonstrate which genome is primarily involved in COX-deficient
(COX(-))-Leigh's syndrome, we generated two lines of transmitochondrial
cybrids. The first was obtained by fusing nuclear DNA-less cytoplasts derived
from normal fibroblasts, with mitochondrial DNA-less (rho degree) transformant
fibroblasts derived from a patient with COX(-))-Leigh's syndrome. The second
cybrid line was obtained by fusing rho degree cells derived from 143B.TK- human
osteosarcoma cells, with cytoplasts derived from the same patient. The first
cybrid line showed a specific and severe COX(-) phenotype, while in the second
all the respiratory chain complexes, including COX, were normal. These results
indicate that the COX defect in our patient is due to a mutation of a nuclear
gene. The use of cybrids obtained from 'customized', patient-derived rho degree
cells can have wide applications in the identification of respiratory chain
defects originated by nuclear DNA-encoded mutations, and in the study of
nuclear DNA-mitochondrial DNA interactions.<p>

ABSTRACT:  An important feature of the mitochondrial genom is the occurrence of
heteroplasmy and the possibility for transmission to the offspring of various
proportions of wild-type and mutated mtDNA. We have investigated the proportion
of the tRNALys A8344G mutation, the tRNALeu(UUR) A3243G mutation, and the
ATPase 6 T8993G mutation in patients with MERRF, MELAS, and Leigh's syndrome
and their maternal relatives. The level of mutated mtDNA in the offspring of
carriers of the tRNALys mutation is correlated to the level in lymphocytes in
the mother and seems to be transmitted by an essentially random mechanism where
only a few mtDNA copies are founders of the mitochondrial genom in the
offspring and the probability that the mutation is not transmitted to the
offspring is high when the mothers carriers predominantly wild-type mtDNA.
However, we found age-related differences in the distribution of mutated mtDNA
in carriers of the tRNALys and tRNALeu mutations, which have to be considered
before levels of mutated mtDNA are used for prediction of prognosis and
transmission of a disorder.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In mammalian cytochrome c oxidase (COX) three of the ten nuclear
coded subunits (VIa, VIIa, VIII) occur in tissue-specific isoforms. The isoform
distribution, however, varies in liver and heart of different species. Subunit
VIII is different in liver and heart of bovine, dog, rat and chicken, but
identical in human (liver-type) on one hand, and sheep, rabbit and rainbow
trout (heart-type) on the other hand, as determined by N-terminal sequencing.
Two moles of trinitrophenyl-ATP bind to monomeric COX from bovine heart and one
to COX from bovine liver with dissociation equilibrium constant (Kd) values of
about 3 microM. One binding site at the heart enzyme is blocked by a monoclonal
antibody to subunit VIa-H. ATP (and/or ADP) interact with COX at two or three
high-affinity binding sites, as shown by titration of the spectral changes of
COX. Isolated COX from bovine heart was reconstituted with variable
intraliposomal ATP/ADP ratios. By measuring the RCR (respiratory control ratio)
and RCRVal (related to the valinomycin-respiration), which is a direct measure
of the H+/e(-)-stoichiometry (Wilson and Prochaska, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 282
(1990) 413-420), almost complete inhibition of the proton pump activity of COX
by high intraliposomal ATP concentrations was found. The vectorial of protons
for the formation of water, however, appears to be unaffected by nucleotides.
This regulatory mechanism is assumed to have physiological significance for
thermogenesis in muscle at rest. COX of fibroblasts from patients suffering
from Leigh's syndrome, which is associated with a decreased COX activity, are
suggested to have an incompletely assembled enzyme complex. This suggestion is
further corroborated by the higher temperature-sensitivity of the enzyme when
compared with COX from normal control fibroblasts. Defective regulation of COX
via nuclear coded subunits is also proposed to cause mitochondrial diseases.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We report clinical, radiological and pathological findings in a
5-year-old girl who died of subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy (SNE)
after 4 weeks of illness. Autopsy revealed endothelial swelling and vacuolar
degeneration of the neuropil in the brain, brain stem and cerebellum. In
addition, the affected areas showed degeneration of the neurons which was
different from anoxic nerve cell damage both with regard to morphological
picture and topographical distribution. This neuronal degeneration was probably
due to the underlying metabolic defect in SNE per se and resembled in several
aspects the nerve cell changes seen in the thalami and inferior olives in
active Wernicke's encephalopathy. It is our opinion that more attention should
be paid to the nerve cell degeneration in SNE rather than focusing on the
relative preservation of these cells.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)-E1 alpha deficiency has recently been
studied at the molecular-genetic level. The gene is situated on the X
chromosome. We report on an unusual mutation in a familial E1 alpha deficiency.
In fibroblasts, PDH deficiency was diagnosed in a young infant presenting with
Leigh's encephalomyelopathy and in a maternal nephew with episodes of
"malaises." In the two affected children as well as their mothers we found a
silent mutation in exon 6 of the PDH-E1 alpha and an aberrant splicing of exon
6 in some of the cDNA clones. This case emphasizes the need for both genomic
and cDNA analysis in cases where a PDH-E1 alpha deficiency is strongly
suspected.<p>

ABSTRACT:  An infant with hypotonia and recurrent apneic spells died with a
diagnosis of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency and showed typical pathological
changes of Leigh's syndrome at postmortem. Despite the prominence of symptoms
suggesting dysfunction of brainstem respiratory centers during life, lesions
were not found in the upper medulla. However, quantitative morphometric
analysis demonstrated abnormal capillary hyperplasia in the region including
and between the nucleus ambiguus and nucleus tractus solitarius. There was an
average area of 8.0 +/- 2.5 x 10(6) mm2 occupied by capillaries per 0.75 mm2
field in the patient's brainstem, compared with 4.6 +/- 1.6 x 10(6) mm2 and 5.5
+/- 1.4 x 10(6) mm2 in two age-matched controls (p &lt; 0.01). We speculate
that capillary hyperplasia is a pathological marker of chronically impaired
oxidative metabolism in the central nervous system in metabolic disease.<p>

ABSTRACT:  An 18-year-old male patient presented with clinical and radiological
evidence of Leigh's syndrome (LS), having developed progressive myoclonic
epilepsy and ataxia 11 years previously. Muscle biopsy showed cytochrome
oxidase deficiency but no ragged red fibres. Autopsy confirmed the diagnosis of
LS; there was additional degenerative change in the cerebellum and dentate and
olivary nuclei, and an axonal peripheral neuropathy. Biochemical studies showed
reduced activity of complexes I and IV of the respiratory chain in mitochondria
from heart, liver and kidney. The mutation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) at
position 8344, commonly associated with the syndrome of myoclonic epilepsy and
ragged red fibres, was detected in the patient's blood and was present in
muscle, brain, liver, heart, and kidney in uniformly high amounts. It is clear
that LS is genetically heterogeneous and represents one of the most severe
phenotypes of a number of different mtDNA defects.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We report eight patients who had a progressive illness dominated by
generalised dystonia and who had clinical and imaging features suggestive of
Leigh's syndrome (LS). Six of the eight cases were male. Early development was
usually normal but three cases exhibited impaired mental and/or motor
development, and three others had a history of an earlier unexplained
encephalopathy or febrile illness. The onset of the dystonia occurred at a mean
age of 3 years (range 2 months-7 years). All had abnormalities in the basal
ganglia on brain imaging; symmetrical bilateral lucencies or calcification were
seen in the basal ganglia on computed tomography scan in five cases, and high
signal lesions were evident in these regions on T2-weighted magnetic resonance
imaging sequences in seven cases. Other causes of such changes in the basal
ganglia were excluded by appropriate investigations. Raised blood lactate
levels were found in four of the eight patients. Muscle biopsies were done in
seven patients but histology and histochemistry were normal. The common
mitochondrial DNA mutations associated with LS in mitochondrial
encephalopathies were not found in the six cases examined. LS presenting as a
pure dystonic syndrome is uncommon, but should be considered in the
differential diagnosis of symptomatic dystonia presenting in childhood.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation 8993 is an important cause of
Leigh's encephalopathy. A family is reported where other affected members have
presented with non-specific delayed development or cerebral palsy. The
diagnosis should be considered not only in children with Leigh's
encephalopathy, but also in those with mild neurological dysfunction (including
cerebral palsy) if there is a pigmentary retinopathy or a family history of
neurological or ophthalmological disease. There was some correlation in this
family between the disease severity and the proportion of mutant mtDNA in the
blood. This mutation appears to segregate to high levels of mutant mtDNA
rapidly within pedigrees and the mother of a severely affected child has a high
risk of having further children with a high proportion of mutant mtDNA and a
severe phenotype.<p>

ABSTRACT:  An example of subacute necrotizing encephalopathy, the fifth case in
Thailand, was recorded. A 7-month-old boy presented clinically with vomiting,
lethargy, respiratory difficulty, deteriorated consciousness, and hypotonia.
The CT brain scan disclosed bilateral symmetrical radiolucencies in the basal
ganglia, especially the lentiform nuclei, and thalami. Postmortem examination
of these areas as well as the periaqueductal region revealed subacute
necrotizing encephalopathy. It was characterized by necrosis, gliosis, and
status spongiosus of the neuropil with relatively preserved neurons, and
hyperplasia of small blood vessels as well as endothelium. As far as we are
aware, the vast majority of abnormalities in the basal ganglia visualized by CT
brain imaging often show calcific foci or high attenuation with asymmetrical
distribution. Bilateral symmetrical lesions of low density are rare. We
reported such an abnormality in a postmortem proven case of Leigh's disease. To
recognize this finding should lead to correct antemortem diagnosis of the
latter.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In a series of 17 cases of Leigh's disease it has been observed that
there is a close correlation between damage to the inferior olivary nuclei by
vasculo-necrotic change and loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex. It
is suggested that this association may be explained on the basis of the
selective loss of climbing fibres causing increased firing activity of Purkinje
cells with consequent excessive entry of calcium ions. In these circumstances
control of calcium ion regulation in the presence of reduced energy production,
which is the basis of this metabolic disease, would be expected to put these
cells' survival seriously at risk.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In a search for pathogenic factors that might play roles in the
selective vulnerability of brain regions to the lesions of Leigh's disease,
archival material from 20 cases of this condition, dying between 1975 and 1992
and aged from 4 days to 11.75 years at death, have been examined. Attention was
paid to the topography of the lesions, their nature and timing in the evolution
of the disease, the clinico-pathological correlations and the ages of the
subjects at onset and at death. The following observations would appear to be
explicable in terms of the present understanding that impairment of cellular
energy generation is known to be defective in some, and probably all, cases.
(i) The characteristic lesion of this disease is symmetrical vasculonecrotic
damage affecting several brainstem centres, the topography of which is variable
and may partly depend upon the age of the individual. (ii) Early features of
this lesion are indistinguishable from a small partial infarction and progress
similarly. The size of the damaged area is generally related to the size of the
region affected. There is no haemorrhagic component and haemosiderin is not at
any time found, unlike the lesions of Wernicke's disease. (iii) The process is
episodic and total tissue damage is thus cumulative. More than one episode of
damage may be seen in a region, changes of clearly different ages being often
present together. (iv) In some regions the lesions appear to be age dependent,
e.g. inferior olivary nuclei, and may be related to behavioral development and
neuronal activity. Other regions show damage at any age, e.g. substantia nigra.
(v) Myelin and sometimes axon loss in optic pathways is usually central, the
periphery being spared. This occurred in more than half the cases and may
represent a partial infarct-like change. (vi) The characteristic dorsal spinal
column degeneration is always associated with focal necrosis of central grey
and white matter; this also resembles a partial infarction with secondary
ascending degeneration. (vii) Massive myelin loss in the centra semiovalia
occurred in one-third of the cases, with or without cavitation, often in
association with spongy myelin changes elsewhere. A mild general spongy change
in myelin alone occurred in two cases. The massive lesions are focal,
infarct-like and analogous to Binswanger's disease. (viii) Selective neuronal
loss, common in some mitochondrial disorders, is not a major feature of Leigh's
disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)<p>

ABSTRACT:  We review the main features of human mitochondrial function and
structure, and in particular mitochondrial transcription, translation, and
replication cycles. Furthermore, some pecularities such as mitochondria's high
polymorphism, the existence of mitochondrial pseudogenes, and the various
considerations to take into account when studying mitochondrial diseases will
also be mentioned. Mitochondrial syndromes mostly affecting the nervous system
have, during the past few years, been associated with mitochondrial DNA (mt
DNA) alterations such as deletions, duplications, mutations and depletions. We
suggest a possible classification of mitochondrial diseases according to the
kind of mt DNA mutations: structural mitochondrial gene mutation as in LHON
(Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy) and NARP (Neurogenic muscle weakness,
Ataxia and Retinitis Pigmentosa) as well as some cases of Leigh's syndrome;
transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA mitochondrial gene mutation as in MELAS
(Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis and Strokelike Episodes) or
MERRF (Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibers) or deafness with
aminoglycoside; structural with transfer RNA mitochondrial gene mutations as
observed in large-scale deletions or duplications in Kearns-Sayre syndrome,
Pearson's syndrome, diabetes mellitus with deafness, and CPEO (Chronic
Progressive External Ophtalmoplegia). Depletions of the mt DNA may also be
classified in this category. Even though mutations are generally maternally
inherited, most of the deletions are sporadic. However, multiple deletions or
depletions may be transmitted in a mendelan trait which suggests that nuclear
gene products play a primary role in these processes. The relationship between
a mutation and a particular phenotype is far from being fully understood. Gene
dosage and energic threshold, which are tissue-specific, appear to be the best
indicators. However, the recessive or dominant behavior of both the wild type
or the mutated genome appears to play a significant role, which can be verified
with in vitro studies.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Rates of ATP synthesis were studied in cultured skin fibroblasts
treated with digitonin. In fibroblasts from patients with complex I deficiency,
complex IV and complex V deficiency rates of ATP synthesis were decreased below
the levels found in controls. In mitochondria isolated from cultured
lymphoblasts, ATP synthesis was also decreased by 35-50% in cases of Leigh's
disease due to complex I, complex IV, or complex V deficiency. Calculating the
effect of the mutations in the various complexes on the overall efficiency of
oxidative phosphorylation, we show that the mtDNA 8993 mutation which affects
the activity of the F1F0 ATPase (complex V) has the strongest effect.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A variety of degenerative diseases involving deficiencies in
mitochondrial bioenergetics have been associated with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
mutations. Maternally inherited mtDNA nucleotide substitutions range from
neutral polymorphisms to lethal mutations. Neutral polymorphisms are ancient,
having accumulated along mtDNA lineages, and thus correlate with ethnic and
geographic origin. Mildly deleterious base substitutions have also occurred
along mtDNA lineages and have been associated with familial deafness and some
cases of Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease. Moderately deleterious
nucleotide substitutions are more recent and cause maternally-inherited
diseases such as Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) and Myoclonic
Epilepsy and Ragged-Red Fiber Disease (MERRF). Severe nucleotide substitutions
are generally new mutations that cause pediatric diseases such as Leigh's
Syndrome and dystonia. MtDNA rearrangements also cause a variety of phenotypes.
The milder rearrangements generally involve duplications and can cause
maternally-inherited adult-onset diabetes and deafness. More severe
rearrangements frequently involving detections have been associated with
adult-onset Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) and
Kearns-Sayre Syndrome (KSS) or the lethal childhood disorder, Pearson's
Marrow/Pancreas Syndrome. Defects in nuclear-cytoplasmic interaction have also
been observed, and include an autosomal dominant mutation causing multiple
muscle mtDNA deletions and a genetically complex disease resulting in the
tissue depletion of mtDNAs. MtDNA nucleotide substitution and rearrangement
mutations also accumulate with age in quiescent tissues. These somatic
mutations appear to degrade cellular bioenergetic capacity, exacerbate
inherited mitochondrial defects and contribute to tissue senescence.  Thus,
bioenergetic defects resulting from mtDNA mutations may be a common cause of
human degenerative disease. <p>

<A NAME="*">*</A>Here's what this jaw-breaker of a word -- necrotizing encephalomyelopathy -- means.  
     First of all, the <I>encephalon</I> is the brain; the <I>pathy</I> part means disease; <I>myel</I> refers to the brain's  white matter, so called because of the suet-like <I>myelin</I> that wraps around the nerve fibers in white matter, providing insulation for them and making for great efficiency in transmitting long-distance messages throughout the nervous system.  (The famous <I>gray</I> matter is where the insulation is laid back so that cells can touch and thus stimulate each other.) <BR>
Okay, then, encephalo-myel-opathy means diseased white matter.  The adjective "necrotizing" comes from necrosis, which means dying.  Thus <I>necrotizing encephalomyelopathy</I> is an irreversible degeneration of the white matter of the brain.  <P>
