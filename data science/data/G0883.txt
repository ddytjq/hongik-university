Straylight Rejection</A>
</H2>

<P>
One of the most significant issues in the payload design is to achieve adequate
rejection of unwanted radiation, which include local (satellite) sources and
Solar System sources.  The requirements in this area are met not only by
appropriate optical design, but also by specifying the allowed orientation 
of the spacecraft with respect to the major sources of straylight. 

<P>
The rejection required of the brightest source, the Sun,
is 93 dB at the most critical frequency (31.5 GHz). 
For the next brightest sources, Earth, Moon and
Jupiter, the rejection requirements are 79 dB, 67 dB and 43 dB, respectively
(assuming a sensitivity of order 
<!-- MATH: $\Delta T/T \sim$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="71" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.gif"
 ALT="$\Delta T/T \sim$">
10<SUP>-6</SUP>).
Due to the orientation possibilities of the spin axis (see Sections 3.7.3 and
4.4), these requirements  
mean that the radiation suppression should be
better than &#126;-93 dB for angles (from the spin axis) larger than
165&#176; , and 
better than &#126;-67 dB 
for angles larger than
150&#176; .
The required rejection is best achieved if
the enclosure is continuously pointed diametrically away from the Sun. 
This orientation of the spin axis towards deep space is also
the most favorable to achieve passive cooling of the enclosure, and the 
required temperature stability (see Section 3.7.1).

<P>
Detailed electromagnetic simulations of the optical enclosure, which take
into account the angular response of individual detectors have been 
performed at 31.5 GHz (see Figure 3.9). This is considered the
most critical channel both because diffraction contributions decrease
with frequency, and because it is the channel at which the telescope is the
least under-illuminated. The simulations show that in the worst case
98% of the power
will propagate from the feed to the subreflector and further on to the main
reflector, where it is reflected again into the antenna boresight direction.
The remaining 2% of the power is scattered in a complicated way into the
half space region defined by the top rim of the shield. This half space
corresponds to the region between -60&#176; and 
120&#176; in Fig. 3.9b. 

<P>
Careful analysis, which includes the presence of the baffle and shield, 
has quantified the effect of
radiation which does not impinge on the main mirror. Two per cent
of the power scattered evenly into a half space corresponds to an average level
which is <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.gif"
 ALT="$\sim$">-64 dB below the peak gain, as indicated by the horizontal 
line in Fig. 3.9b. Representative rays 
not hitting the main reflector are sketched on Fig. 3.9a and their direct 
contributions to the radiation pattern are shown in Fig.3.9b. From the latter
we conclude that the rejection requirements for the Sun, Earth and the Moon
can be met with the current design of the optical enclosure. The requirement 
for Jupiter will be met when Jupiter is located at angles larger than 
&#126;5&#176; from the boresight.  

<P>
It is important to realize that it is the stray signal <I>variations </I>which must be removed from the data
rather than its absolute value. Most of the time, the change in
stray signal will have a much lower amplitude than its absolute value, so that
our requirements are actually extremely conservative.
In addition it will be modulated 
by the 1 rpm spinning rate, which  may  help to identify and remove this
component. Furthermore,  every sky pixel will be observed at
different times during the mission with different relative payload orientations;
this fact can also be used to identify the stray signals. Lastly, 
it has been demonstrated (Section 2.5.2) that it 
will be possible during the commissioning  and operational 
phases to measure the
beam patterns to great accuracy using the observations themselves. 
Altogether, by combining an appropriate 
optical design and observing strategy, it will be possible to cope with the
straylight problem adequately.
