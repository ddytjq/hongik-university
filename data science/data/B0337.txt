        the cost of repaying a mortgage is their largest monthly commitment. When

        all your repayments. But what would happen if through no fault of you 
        own you became unemployed?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The answer is simple, 
        if you take out a mortgage with us, you could if you are eligible receive 
        unemployment cover for your monthly repayments for an agreed period.</font></p>
