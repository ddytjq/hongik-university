<h1>Mortgage FAQs</h1>
<h5>Q: What interest rate will I be charged on my mortgage?</h5>
<p>The rate you will pay is the Standard Variable Rate or the individual rate for
the product you take. If you are taking a discount, capped or fixed rate product we
will advise you of the rate you will be paying and how long you will receive that
rate for.</p>
<h5>Q: What happens at the end of the discounted, capped or fixed rate period?</h5>
<p>Your rate will revert to the standard variable rate or we may offer you another
product.</p>
<h5>Q: What is the standard variable rate?</h5>
<p>This is the rate of interest you pay on your mortgage if you have not taken one
of the discounted, fixed rate or other special products.</p>
<h5>Q: Can I still get a mortgage after a bad debt or missed or late payments?</h5>
<p>Possibly. Each application is looked at on merit.</p>
<h5>Q: Do I need a deposit?</h5>
<p>Yes, the amount differs with each product. </p>
<h5>Q: Who will the Cheshire lend to?</h5>
<p>You must be over 18 to have a mortgage and we would generally recommend that the
mortgage term does not extend beyond your retirement age. You will not be discriminated
against because of your colour, race, ethnic or national origin, your sex or if you
are disabled, however, you will need to have the right to reside and work in the UK
for at least the duration of the mortgage. Up to four people can be joined in an application,
at least one applicant will be required to have an acceptable form of income and all
should have a good credit history. Your application will be subject to a credit check
and you will need to prove your income.</p>
<h5>Q: Which mortgage scheme is best?</h5>
<p>They all have their benefits and which is best for you depends very much on your
personal circumstances.</p>
<h5>Q: How much can I borrow?</h5>
<p>This will depend on how much your property is worth, how much you earn and how
much you can comfortably afford to repay each month.</p>
<h5>Q: Will you lend to ‘Right to Buy’ council tenants?</h5>
<p>Yes. Up to 100% of the discounted price. It is also possible to borrow for home
improvements. A Right to Buy mortgage is a loan taken out by applicants who currently
rent, usually from the council, and are entitled to buy the rented property at a discounted
price.</p>
<h5>Q: Will you lend for ‘Buy to Let’?</h5>
<p>Yes. A Buy to Let mortgage is a loan taken out to buy a house for the income its
tenants could provide, rather than as a home for yourself.</p>
<h5>Q: Will you lend to me if I have a county court judgement against me, if I’ve
been declared bankrupt or if I’ve been in arrears?</h5>
<p>Applicants must have a satisfactory record of mortgage or rental payment (if institutional
landlord e.g. Council, Housing Association, Letting Agency etc) for the last two years
by evidence of a reference, or comprehensive statements, or a rent book.</p>
<p>Any applicant with a history of mortgage arrears or property in possession is not
acceptable.</p>

<h5>Q: How long can the term of the mortgage be?</h5>
<p>The usual term is 25 years but your loan can be for any term from 5 to 40 years
and should end on or before your normal retirement age.</p>
<h5>Q: Does the Cheshire charge interest daily or annually?</h5>
<p>Interest is charged daily on the balance outstanding at the end of the day.</p>
<h5>Q: What is a valuation fee?</h5>
<p>The Cheshire needs expert guidance on what the property in question is worth as
security for us to lend on it. We instruct a Valuer to visit the property and produce
a written report.</p>
<h5>Q: What is the valuation?</h5>
<p>The mortgage valuation is solely for our purposes so that we can be satisfied that
the property provides sufficient security for us to lend on it. The mortgage valuation
does not give any indication as to whether the property is worth what you are paying
for it, nor does it provide a comprehensive list of repairs that may be needed.</p>
<h5>Q: What are the different kinds of survey?</h5>
<p>More detailed inspections of your home are available which are designed to help
you with the choice of property. You may wish to consider the HomeBuyer Survey which
we can arrange to carry out at the same time as the mortgage valuation. Any urgent
and important matters will be brought to your attention before you commit to buying
the property.</p>
<p>An alternative is a Building Survey which includes technical information on construction
and materials as well as details of any defects found, both major and minor.</p>
<h5>Q: What is credit scoring?</h5>
<p>This is a system which helps the Cheshire assess whether an applicant is likely
to be able to repay their loan.</p>
<h5>Q: What is an Intermediary?</h5>
<p>Not everyone comes to the Cheshire via one of our branches. They will use an Intermediary
who recommends our mortgage products to them. Intermediaries can be solicitors, estate
agents, financial advisers or other people connected with the housing market. Intermediaries
have no direct connection with the Cheshire but you should expect them to give you
the kind of guidance you would receive in one of our branches. If you use an Intermediary
please bear in mind that the Cheshire cannot accept responsibility for the advice
you receive.</p>
<h5>Q: Is it safe to transmit my mortgage application to you over the Internet?</h5>
<p>Security of your personal information is a prime concern to the Cheshire. No one
on the Internet can view your personal details. Our online application form enables
you to enter your application details and transmit them electronically to us in a
secure environment. We have used the most up to date security techniques to ensure
your information is received by us in a secure fashion.</p>
<h5>Q: What are the early repayment charges attached to a mortgage?</h5>
<p>Some mortgages may involve some kind of early repayment charge i.e. the amount
of money you will have to pay if you repay your mortgage early or move your mortgage
to another lender within a set period. We will ensure that you are aware of what you
may have to pay.</p>
<h5>Q: Why has my mortgage balance increased?</h5>
<p>It may be that you have not made all your monthly payments or they have not been
paid in full. Have you included payment for insurance in your monthly payment? Our
Customer Contact Centre (0845 055 0567) will be able to give you further assistance.
</p>
<h5>Q: Do I receive a discount for paying by Direct Debit?</h5>
<p>The Cheshire does not currently offer a discount to borrowers who pay their mortgage
by Direct Debit although this is still the most convenient and efficient method of
paying your monthly mortgage repayment.</p>
<h5>Q: What happens if I repay my mortgage early?</h5>
<p>The charges that are made will depend upon the type of product you have chosen
and when you decide to repay your mortgage. Some of our mortgage products may include
an early repayment charge.</p>
<h5>Q: Can I make a capital repayment to my mortgage?</h5>
<p>You should first check with us to see if any early repayment charges will apply
to your mortgage scheme as you may incur an extra charge for making a capital repayment
in the early years of the loan.</p>
<h5>Q: What happens if I can’t afford to make my monthly mortgage payments?</h5>
<p>Please call us straight away. We will do all we can to help you overcome your difficulties
and work with you to find a solution. With your co-operation we can develop a plan
for dealing with your financial difficulties and clearing any arrears.</p>
<h5>Q: What can I do to protect my monthly payments?</h5>
<p>All Cheshire mortgages, excluding Buy To Let, come with 6 months free Mortgage
Care Payment Protection, <a href="../MortgageInformation/Free_Mortgage_Care_Eligibility.asp">subject
to eligibility</a>. We would advise you to take out a mortgage payment protection
policy to cover your monthly mortgage payments in the event of sickness, accident
or unemployment. Please contact our Customer Contact Centre on 0845 055 0567 to discuss
our Mortgage Care insurance and the conditions that apply.</p>
<h5>Q: I have a repayment mortgage, can I change this to an interest only mortgage?</h5>
<p>Yes. Please contact our Mortgage Accounts Administration Department who will be
happy to assist you.</p>
<h5>Q: I have an interest only mortgage, can I change this to a repayment mortgage?</h5>
<p>Yes. Please contact our Mortgage Accounts Administration Department who will be
happy to assist you. </p>
<h5>Q: I would like to pay off my mortgage but I’m not sure what to do with the deeds
of my property. Can you help?</h5>
<p>We offer our borrowers a scheme for the safekeeping of their deeds known as Deeds
Care. The mortgage balance is maintained at £1.00 and this scheme is free for borrowers
who arrange their insurance through the Society. Borrowers who arrange their insurance
elsewhere will be charged £10.00 initially and an annual fee of £25.00.</p>
<h5>Q: Can I have a further advance added to my mortgage for home improvements?</h5>
<p>Please visit one of our branch offices to discuss your requirements and our lending
criteria. We would advise you to arrange quotations for the work to be carried out
in advance of this. If you do not have a Cheshire branch in your vicinity please call
our Customer Contact Centre on 0845 0550567.</p>
<h5>Q: I pay my mortgage by Direct Debit. Can I change the payment collection date?</h5>
<p>Please contact our Customer Contact Centre on 0845 0550567 who will be happy to
amend the payment collection date for you.</p>
<h5>Q: How does an endowment policy work?</h5>
<p>The most common is an interest only mortgage built around an endowment policy.</p>
<p>The policy serves two purposes. Firstly, your monthly endowment premiums, which
you pay direct to the insurance company, are invested on your behalf. After a given
period the policy matures and you must then repay your mortgage. It’s important to
make sure that the policy you have chosen will generate enough money to pay off your
loan and it is advisable to check how it is performing on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Secondly, the endowment policy provides you with life insurance cover. If you should
die before the policy ends the insurance company will repay your mortgage. This is
the minimum death benefit and will be shown on your policy.</p>
<h5>Q: I already have a mortgage with the Cheshire and want to move home, what happens?</h5>
<p>You will have to pay off (redeem) your existing mortgage and may have to pay any
early repayment charge. It is possible that some or all of these charges can be waived
if you take out a new mortgage with the Cheshire.</p>
