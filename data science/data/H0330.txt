An overview:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The motor pathways are pathways which originate inthe brain or brainstem and descend down the spinal cord to controlthe </FONT><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Symbol">a</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">-motorneurons</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">.  These large neurons in the ventralhorns of the spinal cord send their axons out via the spinal rootsand directly control the muscles.  The motor pathways can controlposture, reflexes, and muscle tone, as well as the conscious voluntarymovements that we think of when we hear &quot;motor system&quot;. The most famous pathway is the so called &quot;<B>pyramidal system</B>&quot;,which begins with the large pyramidal neurons of the motor cortex,travels through the pyramids of the brainstem, (somewhere in herethere is a coincidence), and finally ends on or near the </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Symbol">a</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">-motorneurons.  This system is extremely important clinically, as strokesoften affect the motor system.  Therefore it is crucial to understandthe anatomy of the motor pathway.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>B.  The anatomy:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The primary motor pathway is also called the <B>corticospinal</B>pathway.  As all such pathways are named from beginning to end,this pathway starts in cortex and ends in the spine.  Specifically,it starts in the <B>precentral gyrus</B>, the fold of cortex justanterior to the central sulcus.<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bmot1.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The precentral gyrus has many names:  primary motorcortex, Brodmann's area 4, M1, etc.  It provides the bulk of thecorticospinal tract, but other cortical areas contribute as well. One such area is <B>area 3a</B>, part of primary somatosensorycortex, which is hidden down inside the central sulcus.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">If we take a section through the central sulcus,we can see subtle differences between the pre- and post-centralgyri.  All areas of cerebral cortex have six varying layers ofcells, from the most superficial and cell-free layer I to thedeep layer VI.  Each layer has a slightly different cellular makeup,and the thicknesses of the layers vary with cortical area.  Thepostcentral gyrus, also known as primary somatosensory cortex,has a distinct layer IV - across cortical areas, layer IV generallyreceives sensory information.  In the precentral gyrus, the motorcortex doesn't receive much in the way of sensory input, so layerIV is indistinct.  However, layer V, which is generally responsiblefor sending information down to the brainstem and beyond, is veryprominent in motor cortex.   <BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bmot2.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The corticospinal tract originates as the axons ofpyramidal neurons in layer V of (mainly) primary motor cortex. In general, the farther the axon has to go, the larger the neuron. In the precentral gyrus you can see some especially large neurons,visible even at low magnification.  These neurons are called <B>Betzcells</B>, and were once thought to be the sole source of thecorticospinal tract.  We now know that they are only a subsetof the pyramidal neurons which make up the tract.  Pyramidal neurons,incidentally, occur in all types of cortex - it is just a morphologicalname for large neurons that are triangular in shape, pointinga long apical dendrite toward the surface of the brain.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Once the axons leave the pyramidal cells, they enterthe white matter just below layer VI.  Every gyrus in the brainhas this core of white matter, which contains all of the axonsentering or exiting the gyrus.  As you get deeper into the brain,all of these slips of white matter coalesce to form one largebody of axons, the <B>corona radiata</B>, &quot;radiating crown&quot;. As you get still deeper into the hemispheres, the corona radiatadives into the deep nuclei of the brain, the caudate and putamen,splitting them in two.  At this point, all of these axons arecalled the <B>internal capsule</B>.  </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The internal capsule is a major two-way highway,and very vulnerable to strokes.  Sensory information travels upit on the way from the thalamus to the cortex, and motor informationtravels through on the way down to the spine.  As you saw in thehorizontal sections at the beginning of the course, the internalcapsule has an anterior and posterior limb.  The motor and somatosensoryinformation travels through the <B>posterior limb</B>.<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bmot3.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">If you were to follow horizontal sections down throughthe brain, at around the level where the <B>midbrain</B> begins,you would see the internal capsule coalesce into a tight bundleto exit the cerebral hemispheres.  At this point the axons arecalled the <B>cerebral peduncles</B>, or the &quot;stalks&quot;of the cerebrum.  The peduncles make up the floor of the midbrain,and contain all of the descending axons going to the brainstemor spine.  The peduncles, unlike the internal capsule, are largelyone-way; most of the axons in them are heading south.  The ascending,sensory axons take other routes to get to the thalamus.  <BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bmot4.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Once midbrain gives way to <B>pons</B>, two thingshappen to the peduncles.  One, many of the axons from cortex wereactually headed for the pons (the &quot;corticopontine&quot; fibers,of course), so they get off and synapse.  Two, the remaining corticospinalaxons get a little fragmented in the pons, so they are no longervisible as a nice tight bundle.  They can be seen as several smallerbundles, though.</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bmot5.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">In the <B>medulla</B>, the fibers come together againas the <B>pyramids</B>.  The pyramids were actually named as landmarkson the surface of the brainstem - on a human brainstem you canclearly see them as two ridges running down the ventral midline. The pyramids run the entire length of the medulla, large uninterruptedaxon tracts on the ventral surface.</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bmot6.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">At the very caudal-most end of the medulla, rightabout at the point where you have to start calling it cervicalspinal cord, <U>the fibers in the pyramids cross</U>.  The cerebrumcontrols the opposite side of the body, so it had to happen sometime,didn't it?  The crossing event is called the <B>decussation ofthe pyramids</B>, and you can identify it by the way the midlinegroove is suddenly way off the midline.  In any single section,it looks like only one side is crossing, but this is a sectioningartifact.  Large bundles of axons take turns crossing, much likeyour fingers interlace when you clasp your hands.  As you sectiondown through the decussation, the midline fissure will bend firstto one side, then the other.</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bmot7.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">As each individual fiber crosses (remember, theseare still the same axons we started with, from the pyramidal neuronsof area 4!), where does it go?  The pyramids do not merely exchangeplaces.  Instead each crossing axon takes up residence in thelateral white matter of the spinal cord.  By the time the decussationis completed, the corticospinal fibers reside in this new location,now called the <B>lateral corticospinal tract</B>.</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bmot8.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">From this position they dive into the grey matterof the spinal cord at their target levels.  Those fibers controllingthe arms, for example, get off in the cervical levels of the cord. Once in the <B>ventral horn</B> they synapse either on interneurons(most common) or directly on the </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Symbol">a</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">-motorneurons.  They preferentially innervate the limbs and distal muscles.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>C.  A lesson in nomenclature:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">As you may have learned in anatomy, if there is a<I>greater</I> horn of Ubu, there is probably also a <I>lesser</I>horn of Ubu.  (Fictional, don't look it up.)  Likewise, if thereis a lateral corticospinal tract, there must also be a medialone.  Indeed there is, only it is called the <B>anterior corticospinaltract</B>.  Take comfort in the fact that it does actually liemedially.  These fibers were part of the original corticospinaltract, and made up 15-20% of the pyramids, but at the decussation,they <U>did not cross</U>.  As a result, in the spinal cord theyare still sitting right where the pyramids were - ventrally, oneither side of the midline.</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bmot9.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">These fibers also dive into the ventral horns atappropriate levels, and they tend to innervate the muscles ofthe trunk.  Fine finger movements and tap dancing are the exclusivedomain of the lateral corticospinal tract, but push-ups and hula-hoopingrely more on the anterior corticospinal tracts.  <BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>D.  In summary:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Here is a diagram summarizing the two main pathwaysof the voluntary motor system:<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="bmot10.gif"></CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>E.  Clinical notes:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">In motor cortex, the body is mapped out across theextent of the gyrus.  Control of the feet lies near the midlineat the top of the gyrus, whereas the lateral side of the gyruscontrols the hands and face.  Because the body parts are spreadso widely in cortex, cortical strokes are rarely big enough toaffect an entire half of the body.  Instead, the hands or face,which take up the most cortical area, are preferentially affected. Strokes in the internal capsule are a different story.  Fibersare bundled together so closely that a small stroke can in factparalyze an entire side of the body - this is called <B>hemiplegia</B>(half-paralysis) or <B>hemiparesis</B> (half-weakness).  If astroke occurs in the brainstem, affecting the pyramids, the hemiparesiswill often be accompanied by other symptoms or &quot;neighborhoodsigns&quot;; the brainstem is a very crowded place.  </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Although the cortex is primarily concerned with thecontralateral (opposite) side of the body, some muscle groupsget innervation from both hemispheres.  This bilateral innervationprotects the muscle groups in case of stroke.  Most of the musclesin the trunk are bilaterally innervated, so that even hemiplegicpatients can hold their torsos upright.  For some reason, theforehead also receives bilateral innervation, which can be a keyclue in determining if a patient's facial paralysis is due toa cerebral stroke or a peripheral nerve injury.  In a cerebral stroke patient, onlythe lower half of the face (on one side) will be affected.  Ina patient with Bell's palsy (a temporary inflammation of the facialnerve), the entire side of the face will be affected.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=#0000FF FACE="Palatino"><A HREF="http://thalamus.wustl.edu/course">RETURN TO HOME PAGE</A><BR></FONT></B></BODY></HTML>
