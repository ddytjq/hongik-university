| Hi Tom,
| 
| Feel free to quote that limerick.  By the way, I wrote a short article
| highlighting your web site called "Flipping over the double helix".  It was
| published in Enantiomer, 4, 487, 1999.  Let me know if you would like me to
| FAX a copy.  Also, I point your attention to an advertisement by Sigma
| Genosys running currently in Science.  The ad shows a DNA helix relflected
| in a human eye.  It's depicted as right handed, but should be left-handed
| since it's a mirror reflection.
| Keep up the good work,

As shown in the figures to the left and right,
most DNA twists as a "right-hand screw".  This
is the same direction as a regular wood
or

-->
<a href = "http://www.pst.thomasregister.com/olc/pst/wormshft.htm">metal<IMG

screw.
Many artists will
<a href = "http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/sciencetiff.html"
>flip</a>
a picture of DNA over and reverse the twist.
Although left-handed DNA has been demonstrated
by crystallization and STM, it only recently been established
that it ever occurs <I>in vivo</I>
(<a href =

Science 1999 Jun 11;284(5421):1841-5</a>,
<a href =
"http://www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/062999sci-genome-zdna.html">New
York Times, June 29, 1999</a>)

Furthermore the structure of this left-handed
<a href =
"http://www.lmb.uni-muenchen.de/groups/Biostruc/chap-08/chap-08-slides.html">"Z-DNA"<IMG
SRC="icons/dna-bz.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT"></a>
is quite different from a mirror image of B-form DNA.
So most of these inverted twist pictures are incorrect.
This error has become so pervasive that even
well-known scientists, major scientific journals and institutes make it.
For several years
I was collecting these cases by tossing them into a file.
On 1996 February 14, I was stunned and embarrassed
that my file had grown enormous,
so I created this page to alert people to the problem.
(Thanks to
Eric Putz at
my alma mater
<a href = "http://beagle.colorado.edu/">CU's MCDB</a>

Subject: left handed dna

Dear Tom,

I really enjoyed browsing through your left handed hall of fame.  Last
weekend there was a small story in one of the Dutch newspapers about it
so I guess you may notice an increase in Dutch hits this week. I had
noticed a left handed twist in a book I am currently working with, and I
could not find the entry in you list using several different "find-"
entries.  So maybe it is a new one?
The book is
Concepts of genetics, 6th edition
William S Klug and Michael R Cummings
published by Prentice Hall, inc.
Upper Sadle river, New Jersey
ISBN 0-13-08626-4

The left handed molecule can be found on Page 530, with a small version
on page xxiv

I can send you a copy, if necessary.
Good luck with your hall of fame page,
Best wishes,
Maarten

The book is not on the site, though maybe the image already is.

Please do send me a copy of the book cover, the first page, the page with
the isbn on it and the relevant pages inside.  (That's a complete record.)

I'm terribly far behind but eventually will put it in.

In an email today
Nigel Morrison,
Art Editor for the journal <i>Chemistry in Britain</i>,
pointed out that
<a href =
"http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/Leftyear2000.html#Chemistry.in.Brittain"
>some of the images he got
from PhotoDisc</a>
had been corrected!
Has
<a href =
"http://www.gettyimages.com/photodisc"
target = "lefthandedDNA"
>PhotoDisc
(http://www.gettyimages.com/photodisc)</a>
turned around?
Maybe not.
Out of 12 DNA images on their web page, 5 are left handed.
<!--
page 1: 4 of 8
page 2: 1 of 4
total:  5 of 12
-->
It's still pretty much the luck of the draw!
Buyer beware!
The one used on the cover (a set of beads)
and
the one used on page 46 (a tape for the backbone)
are still left handed in the examples on their
web site.
Maybe they advertise left handed DNA but you get
a right handed image?

| This is a copyrighted image, so I must ask that you remove this picture from

| 
| If you wish to contact Michael Dunning to negotiate permission for use and a

| 
| Ok!

| 
| Yes, the images get flipped and then you don't have a good referent ...
| 
| By the way, navigating your web site is very awkward because the "<" and ">"
| arrows are so small.  I keep slipping off them and getting big images I don't
| want or getting nothing for my click.  (Woe is me - my click finger is
| wearing out!!  ;-)  Also, I looked around a bunch and could not find the DNA
| image.  A page of thumbnails would be really handy!!
| 
| I finally found it under manipulation!
| 
| http://www.michaeldunning.com/manipulated/1-dna-big.jpg
| 
| (Note that the name is manipulation but the directory is manipulated ...)
| 
| That one is only 22403 bytes.
| 
| So I'm not sure where the 480K version is, but the 154495 byte one is fine
| and is now at

Spider-man is taking a picture.
Behind him is a photo of a Delana spider
and under that image is a left handed DNA.
The next scene is in a lab is where another <i>different</i>
image of a left-handed DNA is shown.
Clearly Spider-man got his powers from a left handed DNA spider!
The species seems to be
<i>Delena cancerides</i>, which are mentioned in

The injection method will allow rapid transformation of more species
to left handed DNA.  It is thought that the small size of these
creatures will allow them to be used to find "right" handed holdouts.

   redox based modification, not DNA-- was easier to make this way.  This is
   why it is a schematic ...  Inversion vs rotation was the least of our

| Hi Tom,
| 
| Sure, you can use the whole cover image if you'd like.  If you just want
| to use the DNA strand itself, We'd need to put you in touch with the
| artist directly.  But there's no problem with you using the whole cover.
| 
| Thanks so much,
|

| Dear Dr Schneider:
| 
| Thanks for your message. While we are embarassed by our mistake, and would
| willingly be pilloried by your web site, I regret that we cannot give you
| permission to reproduce the image from The Scientist cover of June 24 on
| your web site. We licensed the image (at considerable cost) from a
| commercial image database -- images.com -- for one time use on our cover.
| Hence we cannot give you permission to reproduce it on your web site, and
| advise you to remove it.
| 
| Incidentally, your invocation of the "fair use" provision of the Copyright
| Act is inappropriate. Fair use allows a restricted amount of copying for
| personal use. What you are doing is republishing, for all the world to see.
| There is no fair use provision covering publishing.

| Dear Dr. Grimwade:
| 
| Thanks for your rapid response.  I understand the situation and so have
| changed the tag to the special 'permission denied: exclusive image'.
| 
| How about this?  You can go to them and say that the product that they gave
| you was 'defective'.  You can ask for your money back!  :-)
| 
| Thanks for the note about fair use.  It seems that just changing from "Fair
| Use" to 'non-commmercial use' may do the trick.
| 
| Sigh.  That company has many left handed DNAs.  This is never ending!!

If you would like to contribute examples, please

hard physical evidence that documents the case,
along with all reference materials that are available.
It helps if you check through the previous entries to see if you
have been scooped, as I do not repeat (even for really egregious
cases).
Precise web pointers are appreciated as it saves me time.
If there is an image on the web just tell me where it is,
please
<font color = red><i><strong>
NEVER send me images that I can get from the web!
</strong> </i></font>
I have to check them anyway and I use

to grab them.
Let me put that another way:
<font color = red><i><strong>

Also please indicate whether you would like to be acknowledged
on this page.

Of course this page is devoted to left handed DNA images.
I do not include images that are right handed, you can save
us both time and trouble by making sure the image you spot
really is left handed.
If an image is
<a href =
"leftpolicy.html"
target = "lefthandedDNA"
>flat</a> I don't include it either.
I have another page for 
<a href =
"http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/RightHanded.DNA.html"
target = "lefthandedDNA"
>right handed DNA images</a>
but I will <i>only</i> put images there if I LIKE them,
which will be very rare.
