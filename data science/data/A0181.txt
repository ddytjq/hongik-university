<p class="contenttextbold">Flexible Payment Mortgage</p>

<p>The savings compare the Flexible Payment Mortgage with our standard 25 year Repayment Mortgage of the same amount.</p>

<p>Interest rates may vary which could affect repayments. Rates correct as at 14th November 2001. Typical example: A Flexible Payment Mortgage of &pound;50,000 over 18 years and 5 months at an interest rate of 5.95% <span class="contenttextbold">(typical APR 6.2% variable)</span> gives 221 monthly repayments commencing at &pound;324.40 in the first year with repayments increased thereafter by 1.95% each year giving 12 repayments each of &pound;330.72, &pound;337.16, &pound;343.73, &pound;350.43, &pound;357.26, &pound;364.22, &pound;371.32, &pound;378.56, &pound;385.94, &pound;393.46, &pound;401.13, &pound;408.95, &pound;416.92, &pound;425.04, &pound;433.32, &pound;441.76, &pound;450.37 with 4 repayments of &pound;459.15 and 1 final payment of &pound;138.50. The total amount repayable of &pound;85,425.13 includes an establishment fee of &pound;200, estimated solicitors fees of &pound;176.25, a security release fee of &pound;75 and a CHAPS fee of &pound;22.50. The maximum loan is 95% for First Time Buyers, 90% for existing property owners, based on the lower of the purchase price or valuation. For loans of 90% or more Mortgage Guarantee Insurance is required. Loans of more than 75% of the lower of purchase price or valuation may require a professional valuation and an additional fee.</p>

<p class="contenttextbold">Flexible Repay Facility and Rapid Repay Facility</p> 

            <p>Written quotations are available on request. All loans are subject 
              to status and applicants must be 18 or over. Security is required.<br>
            </p>
            <p>For <b>Yorkshire Bank Flexible Repay</b> the minimum gross income 
              required is &pound;25,000 single or &pound;35,000 joint income. 
              For <b>Yorkshire Bank Flexible Repay</b> and <b>Yorkshire Bank Rapid 
              Repay</b> the minimum loan amount is &pound;40,000. These Facilities 
              are not available for business purposes.<br>
            </p>
            <p>The savings which you are able to make are based on comparing our 
              <b>Yorkshire Bank Rapid Repay/Yorkshire Bank Flexible Repay</b> 
              to our Flexible Payment Mortgage of the same amount with no annual 
              step-up. For example, if you had a <b>Yorkshire Bank Rapid Repay/Yorkshire 
              Bank Flexible Repay</b> of &pound;50,000 and you paid &pound;1,500 
              into your account each month and spent &pound;1,000 at even intervals 
              throughout the month, you would have a surplus of &pound;500 in 
              the account to reduce your outstanding loan amount and cover any 
              debit interest due. By leaving this amount each month you could 
              pay off your mortgage 13 years and 2 months early and save &pound;28,760 
              in interest.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Interest rates may vary which could affect repayments. Rates correct 
              as at 23rd April 2002. Typical example: for a <b>Yorkshire Bank 
              Rapid Repay/Yorkshire Bank Flexible Repay</b> of &pound;50,000 over 
              11 years and 3 months if you paid &pound;1,500 into your current 
              account each month and spent &pound;1,000 at even intervals throughout 
              the month you will pay 5.24%<b> (APR 5.4% variable).</b> The APR 
              includes an establishment fee of &pound;200, legal fees estimated 
              to be &pound;176, professional valuation estimated at &pound;150, 
              a CHAPS fee of &pound;22.50 and a security release fee of &pound;75. 
              The maximum loan is 90% of the value of the property for <b>Yorkshire 
              Bank Rapid Repay </b>and 80% for <b>Yorkshire Bank Flexible Repay</b>, 
              based on the lower of the purchase price or valuation. Loans more 
              than 75% of the lower of purchase price or valuation may require 
              a professional valuation and an additional fee. You will be paid 
              credit interest if the balance of your current account and <b>Yorkshire 
              Bank Rapid Repay/Yorkshire Bank Flexible Repay</b> is in credit 
              - please refer to the Personal Banking Tariff Guide.<br>
            </p>
            <p>With<b> Yorkshire Bank Rapid Repay</b> and<b> Yorkshire Bank Flexible 
              Repay</b> there is no fixed repayment amount or repayment frequency. 
              You have complete flexibility to pay in additional sums and withdraw 
              sums so long as you ensure that the Limit is not exceeded. With 
              the <b>Yorkshire Bank Rapid Repay</b> the Safety Limit reduces until 
              the loan is fully repaid and can be over any term up to 25 years. 
              The Safety Limit is based on what would otherwise have been the 
              balance of our Standard Repayment Mortgage (assuming interest charged 
              on a daily basis). With <b>Yorkshire Bank Flexible Repay</b> the 
              Limit remains unchanged for the term of your loan. You must repay 
              the whole balance of the loan outstanding at the end of the term 
              from your own resources.<br>
            </p>
            <p>With <b>Yorkshire Bank Rapid Repay</b> and <b>Yorkshire Bank Flexible 
              Repay</b> it is a requirement that the principal borrower's salary 
              must be paid into the account.<br>
