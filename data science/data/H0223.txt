From rostralto caudal, they are the <B>olfactory cortex</B>, the <B>amygdala</B>,and the <B>hippocampus</B>.  We will look at the anatomy and functionof each separately, although they are often grouped together as&quot;the limbic system&quot;.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino"  COLOR=#CC00CC>A. The olfactory system:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >The olfactory system actually begins in the roofof the nasal cavity.  The <B>olfactory receptors</B> are ciliatedepithelial cells with an array of receptors capable of detectingthousands of different odors.  <BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="lim1.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >However, just as with any sensory system, <U>thereceptor neurons themselves do not project to the cerebral hemispheres</U>. Their axons project up through the cribiform plate of the skullto synapse on the dendrites of the <B>mitral cells</B> of the<B>olfactory bulb</B>. The axons of the olfactory receptors makeup the elusive cranial nerve I. This fragile tract is susceptibleto shearing forces in head trauma, and loss of smell is a surprisinglydebilitating injury.<BR></FONT><CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD WIDTH=257><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >Here is an example of a section through olfactory bulb.  The olfactory bulb is not a simple relay (something which passively transmits the signal), but is a sophisticated structure in itself.  The mitral cell- olfactory neuron synapse is actually within a tangle of axons and dendrites that is called a <B>glomerulus</B>.  There is a second cell type tucked around these glomeruli which probably affects how the signal is transmitted.  These cells are small and densely packed, which gives them the name "<B>granule cells</B>".  However, they bear no relation to the granule cells of the cerebellum or cerebral cortex.  In fact, they are GABA-ergic, unlike other cells of the same name.</FONT></TD><TD WIDTH=257><BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="lim2.gif"></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2 WIDTH=515><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >There are two populations of granule cells in the olfactory bulb - the external, or periglomerular cells, and the internal granule cells.  The latter lie deep to the mitral cell layer.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >The mitral cell axons travel back to the brain viathe olfactory tract. The main target of the olfactory tract isthe <B>primary olfactory cortex</B> in the medial temporal lobe. However, the sense of smell is heavily interconnected with allparts of the limbic system.  </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >Does anything about this system strike you as odd? The olfactory system disobeys a general rule of sensory systems- it does not have to pass through thalamus before reaching cortex. However, there is a very good reason why not; olfactory cortexis an old and primitive structure, and in fact has only four cellularlayers, unlike the 6-layered cortex we are accustomed to.  Therule that <U>sensory information must pass through thalamus toget to cerebral cortex</U> is still true, but only for 6-layeredcortex, or <B>neocortex</B>.  This description applies to almostevery area in the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino"  COLOR=#CC00CC>B. The amygdala:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >If you remember only one word about the amygdala,the word is FEAR.  The amygdala is the nucleus responsible forthe lurch you feel in your stomach when you turn around in a darkalley and notice someone following you.  It couples a learnedsensory stimulus (man in ski mask in alley = danger) to an adaptiveresponse (fight or flight).  On the basis of this information,you should be able to guess the primary inputs to and outputsfrom the amygdala.<BR></FONT><P><U><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >Inputs</FONT></U><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >:  the amygdalamust get sensory input, and it must be fairly highly processedinput to recognize the elements of a scene that signal danger. The association areas of visual, auditory, and somatosensorycortices are the main inputs to the amygdala.</FONT><P><U><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >Outputs</FONT></U><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >:  the amygdalamust be able to control the autonomic system, to provoke suchan instant sympathetic response.  The main outputs of the amygdalaare to the hypothalamus and brainstem autonomic centers, includingthe vagal nuclei and the sympathetic neurons.  <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >The amygdala is also involved with mood and the consciousemotional response to an event, whether positive or negative. To this end, the amygdala is also extensively interconnectedwith <B>frontal cortex</B>, mediodorsal thalamus, and the medialstriatum.<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="lim3.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >These two images of the amygdala demonstrate thatthere are discrete groups of cells within the large nucleus. The deep group, which includes the <B>lateral, basal,</B> and<B>accessory</B> <B>basal nuclei</B>, is responsible for collectingthe input from sensory cortex.  The more dorsal group, which includesthe <B>central</B> and <B>medial nuclei</B>, receives projectionsfrom the deep group and sends the signal out to autonomic centers.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >It is very difficult to study the amygdala in humans,because selective bilateral damage of the amygdala is so rare. One of the few existing case studies reported a woman with abilateral degenerative disease who was unable to recognize theexpression of fear in human faces.  Monkeys with lesioned amygdalasare unable to recognize the emotional significance of objects,and for example, show no fear when presented with a snake or anotheraggressive monkey.  This has disastrous social consequences forthe monkey. </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >Epilepsy surgery provides an opportunity to stimulateareas of the brain to determine the extent of the epileptic focus. In some such patients, the amygdala was electrically stimulated,which caused intense hallucinations, often accompanied by fear. <BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino"  COLOR=#CC00CC>C.  The hippocampus and memory:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >If the amygdala is FEAR, then the hippocampus isMEMORY.  To understand exactly how the hippocampus is involvedin memory, however, you must first know a little about memory.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >There are at least three different types of memory. The most short term is <B>working memory</B>.  Working memoryis like the RAM of a computer.  It is the type of memory thatenables you to spit back the last sentence of a coversation whensomeone accuses you of not listening.  Like the RAM of a computer,it is crucial for performing some common operations in your head:adding numbers, composing a sentence, following directions, etc. Also like a computer, the space devoted to that operation isrecycled as soon as you turn to something else.  It does not becomea permanent memory.  Working memory does not require the hippocampus;it is probably a cortical phenomenon.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >The second type is what we most commonly associatewith "memory".  This is long-term or <B>declarativememory</B>, and is composed of all the facts, figures, and namesyou have ever learned.  All of your experiences and consciousmemory fall into this category.  It is analogous to the hard driveof a computer.  Although no one knows exactly where this enormousdatabase is stored, it is clear that the <U>hippocampus is necessary</U>to file away new memories as they occur.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >The third type is <B>procedural memory</B>, and isprobably the most durable form of memory.  These are actions,habits, or skills that are learned simply by repetition.  Examplesinclude playing tennis, playing an instrument, solving a puzzle,etc.  The hippocampus is not involved in procedural memory, butit is likely that the cerebellum plays a role in some instances. <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >The significance of the hippocampus is driven homeby a famous patient named H.M.  As part of an epilepsy surgery,doctors removed most of his medial temporal lobes.  Since thatsurgery, in 1953, he has formed no new memories.  He can rememberhis childhood and everything before the surgery, and he stillhas working memory and the ability to form procedural memories. You can have a normal, lucid conversation with him, but if youleave the room for a moment, when you return he will not rememberyou or the conversation.  He has completely lost the ability tolay down declarative memory.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >Therefore, <U>the hippocampus is critical in layingdown declarative memory, but is not necessary for working memory,procedural memory, or memory storage.</U>  Damage to the hippocampuswill only affect the formation of new declarative memories.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >The mechanisms of the hippocampus are not entirelyunderstood.  The formation of memories probably involves <B>longterm potentiation</B>, or LTP.  This is a molecular process whichstrengthens groups of synapses that are repeatedly used.  LTPis not sufficient to explain the storage of memory, though.  <BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino"  COLOR=#CC00CC>D.  The anatomy of the hippocampus:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >The hippocampus is a scrolled structure located inthe medial temporal lobe.  In a coronal section, it looks likethis:<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="lim4.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >The hippocampus can be divided into at least fivedifferent areas, as labeled above.  The <B>dentate gyrus</B> isthe dense dark layer of cells at the "tip" of the hippocampus. Areas <B>CA3</B> and <B>CA1</B> are more diffuse; the small CA2is hard to distinguish between them. (CA stands for <I>cornu ammonis</I>,from its ram's horn shape.) The <B>subiculum</B> sits at the baseof the hippocampus, and is continuous with <B>entorhinal cortex</B>,which is part of the parahippocampal gyrus.  There is essentiallya one-way flow of information through the hippocampus, as diagrammedbelow.<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="lim5.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >Information enters the hippocampus by jumping acrosswhat appears to be a gap between the subiculum and dentate gyrus. This tract is called the <B>perforant path</B>, as it perforatesthe space between the two.  The entorhinal axons then synapseon cells in the dentate gyrus.  The dentate neurons, in turn,send axons to CA3; these are called <B>mossy fibers</B>.  ("Mossyfibers" is a morphological description for axons with largebulbous terminals, and these are unrelated to those in the cerebellum.) CA3 sends axons called <B>Schaeffer collaterals</B> to CA1, whichsends yet another set of fibers to the subiculum.  The subiculumis responsible for the output of the hippocampus:  it can eithersend axons directly to the hypothalamus and mammillary bodiesvia the <B>fornix</B> (remember the fornix?), or it can pass alongthe information back to entorhinal cortex, which will relay itall back to sensory cortex.  It is essentially one continuouspathway that begins in sensory cortex, traverses the hippocampus(loop-the-loop), and returns to sensory cortex.  Somewhere inthere, memory is born.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino"  COLOR=#CC00CC>E.  Diseases of the hippocampus:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >The hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to severaldisease processes, including <B>ischemia</B>, which is any obstructionof blood flow or oxygen deprivation, <B>Alzheimer's disease</B>,and <B>epilepsy</B>.  These diseases selectively attack CA1, whicheffectively cuts through the hippocampal circuit.  Below is aphotograph of a normal hippocampus and one which has been deprivedof oxygen.<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="lim6.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >You should be able to see the degeneration of CA1(labeled) and the absence of cell bodies (stained purple).  Astroke can have this effect, but there must be bilateral damageof the hippocampi to affect memory.  Therefore only situationsthat deplete blood or oxygen flow to the entire brain will producea memory deficit.  The pathology of severe temporal lobe epilepsylooks very similar to ischemic damage.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" >Alzheimer's disease, although it affects the entirebrain, is particularly hard on the CA1 region.  Below is a photographof the hippocampus of an Alzheimer's patient, with the CA1 regionmagnified.  Both extracellular plaques and intracellular tanglesare visible - these are the pathological hallmarks of the disease.<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="lim7.gif"><BR><BR></CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=#0000FF FACE="Palatino"><A HREF="http://thalamus.wustl.edu/course">RETURN TO HOME PAGE</A><BR></FONT></B></BODY></HTML>
