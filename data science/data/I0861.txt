    <p>Following the 'Di Canio' incident at Hillsboro, the media and most footballing
    institutions have condemned the actions of the hotheaded Italian. </p>
    <p>The referee, Mr. Alcock has apparently suggested that he may quit the game because of
    the incident. </p>
    <p>There were and still are immediate calls for a lifetime ban from football for Di Canio,
    and comparisons with the Cantona kicking incident.</p>
    <p>While Paulo was idiotic to do what he did, the referee was pushed - hardly assault
    worthy. In normal conditions he would have been able to keep his feet and Di Canio would
    have received an extended ban of 4-5 games. </p>
    <p>Precedence for this type of incident are numerous.</p>
    <p>Tom Beardsley, football historian recalls <font size="3">a famous incident in a 1966
    League match where Doncaster Rovers winger, Tony Coleman (who went on to have an
    illustrious career with Manchester City), produced a stunning left hook which caught
    Stockport referee John Pickles square on the chin, after Pickles had sent Coleman off.</font></p>
    <p>The bandwagon that FA will undoubtedly jump on here is an extension of the
    shortchanging of supporters that has been happening ever since the money men have taken
    over our game.</p>
    <p>The sterilisation of the game is ruining the experience for the supporter - will the FA
    hand out reasonable punishment for the stupid Di Canio, or will they follow the media
    frenzy and ban him for life. </p>
    <p>Whatever they do, it cannot be as severe as Eric Cantona's punishment. And it should be
    a lot less severe than Tony Coleman's.</td>
