Max Planck made many contributions to theoretical physics, but his fame
rests primarily on his role as originator of the quantum theory. This theory
revolutionized our understanding of atomic and subatomic processes, just as
Albert Einstein's theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of
space and time. Together they constitute the fundamental theories of
20th-century physics. Both have forced man to revise some of his most
cherished philosophical beliefs, and both have led to industrial and
military applications that affect every aspect of modern life.
</p>

<CENTER> Early life </CENTER></p>

Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck was born on April 23, 1858, in Kiel, Germany,
the sixth child of a distinguished jurist and professor of law at the
University of Kiel. The long family tradition of devotion to church and
state, excellence in scholarship, incorruptibility, conservatism, idealism,
reliability, and generosity became deeply ingrained in Planck's own life and
work. When Planck was nine years old, his father received an appointment at
the University of Munich, and Planck entered the city's renowned Maximilian
Gymnasium, where a teacher, Hermann Müller, stimulated his interest in
physics and mathematics. But Planck excelled in all subjects, and after
graduation at age 17 he faced a difficult career decision. He ultimately
chose physics over classical philology or music because he had
dispassionately reached the conclusion that it was in physics that his
greatest originality lay. Music, nonetheless, remained an integral part of
his life. He possessed the gift of absolute pitch and was an excellent
pianist who daily found serenity and delight at the keyboard, enjoying
especially the works of Schubert and Brahms. He also loved the outdoors,
taking long walks each day and hiking and climbing in the mountains on
vacations, even in advanced old age.
</p>

Planck entered the University of Munich in the fall of 1874 but found little
encouragement there from physics professor Philipp von Jolly. During his
Wanderjahr (1877-78) at the University of Berlin, he was unimpressed by the
lectures of Hermann von Helmholtz and Gustav Robert Kirchhoff, despite their
eminence as research scientists. His intellectual capacities were, however,
brought to a focus as the result of his independent study, especially of
Rudolf Clausius' writings on thermodynamics. Returning to Munich, he
received his doctoral degree in July 1879 (the year of Einstein's birth) at
the unusually young age of 21. The following year he completed his
Habilitationsschrift (qualifying dissertation) at Munich and became a
Privatdozent (lecturer). In 1885, with the help of his father's professional
connections, he was appointed ausserordentlicher Professor (associate
professor) at the University of Kiel. In 1889, after the death of Kirchhoff,
Planck received an appointment to the University of Berlin, where he came to
venerate Helmholtz as mentor and colleague. In 1892 he was promoted to
ordentlicher Professor (full professor). He had only nine doctoral students
altogether, but his Berlin lectures on all branches of theoretical physics
went through many editions and exerted great influence. He remained in
Berlin for the rest of his active life.
</p>

Planck recalled that his "original decision to devote myself to science was
a direct result of the discovery . . . that the laws of human reasoning
coincide with the laws governing the sequences of the impressions we receive
from the world about us; that, therefore, pure reasoning can enable man to
gain an insight into the mechanism of the [world]. . . ." He deliberately
decided, in other words, to become a theoretical physicist at a time when
theoretical physics was not yet recognized as a discipline in its own right.
But he went further: he concluded that the existence of physical laws
presupposes that the "outside world is something independent from man,
something absolute, and the quest for the laws which apply to this absolute
appeared . . . as the most sublime scientific pursuit in life."
</p>

The first instance of an absolute in nature that impressed Planck deeply,
even as a Gymnasium student, was the law of the conservation of energy, the
first law of thermodynamics. Later, during his university years, he became
equally convinced that the entropy law, the second law of thermodynamics,
was also an absolute law of nature. The second law became the subject of his
doctoral dissertation at Munich, and it lay at the core of the researches
that led him to discover the quantum of action, now known as Planck's
constant h, in 1900.
</p>

In 1859-60 Kirchhoff had defined a blackbody as an object that re-emits all
of the radiant energy incident upon it; i.e., it is a perfect emitter and
absorber of radiation. There was, therefore, something absolute about
blackbody radiation, and by the 1890s various experimental and theoretical
attempts had been made to determine its spectral energy distribution--the
curve displaying how much radiant energy is emitted at different frequencies
for a given temperature of the blackbody. Planck was particularly attracted
to the formula found in 1896 by his colleague Wilhelm Wien at the
Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (PTR) in Berlin-Charlottenburg, and he
subsequently made a series of attempts to derive "Wien's law" on the basis
of the second law of thermodynamics. By October 1900, however, other
colleagues at the PTR, the experimentalists Otto Richard Lummer, Ernst
Pringsheim, Heinrich Rubens, and Ferdinand Kurlbaum, had found definite
indications that Wien's law, while valid at high frequencies, broke down
completely at low frequencies.
</p>

Planck learned of these results just before a meeting of the German Physical
Society on October 19. He knew how the entropy of the radiation had to
depend mathematically upon its energy in the high-frequency region if Wien's
law held there. He also saw what this dependence had to be in the
low-frequency region in order to reproduce the experimental results there.
Planck guessed, therefore, that he should try to combine these two
expressions in the simplest way possible, and to transform the result into a
formula relating the energy of the radiation to its frequency.
</p>

Planck's formulation was hailed as indisputably correct. To Planck, however,
it was simply a guess, a "lucky intuition." If it was to be taken seriously,
it had to be derived somehow from first principles. That was the task to
which Planck immediately directed his energies, and by December 14, 1900, he
had succeeded--but at great cost. To achieve his goal, Planck found that he
had to relinquish one of his own most cherished beliefs, that the second law
of thermodynamics was an absolute law of nature. Instead he had to embrace
Ludwig Boltzmann's interpretation, that the second law was a statistical
law. In addition, Planck had to assume that the oscillators comprising the
blackbody and re-emitting the radiant energy incident upon them could not
absorb this energy continuously but only in discrete amounts, in quanta of
energy; only by statistically distributing these quanta, each containing an
amount of energy h proportional to its frequency, over all of the
oscillators present in the blackbody could Planck derive the formula he had
hit upon two months earlier. He adduced additional evidence for the
importance of his formula by using it to evaluate the constant h (his value
was 6.55 10{sup -27} erg-second, close to the modern value), as well as the
so-called Boltzmann constant (the fundamental constant in kinetic theory and
statistical mechanics), Avogadro's number, and the charge of the electron.
As time went on physicists recognized ever more clearly that--because
Planck's constant was not zero but had a small but finite value--the
microphysical world, the world of atomic dimensions, could not in principle
be described by ordinary classical mechanics. A profound revolution in
physical theory was in the making.
</p>

Planck's concept of energy quanta, in other words, conflicted fundamentally
with all past physical theory. He was driven to introduce it strictly by the
force of his logic; he was, as one historian put it, a reluctant
revolutionary. Indeed, it was years before the far-reaching consequences of
Planck's achievement were generally recognized, and in this Einstein played
a central role. In 1905, independently of Planck's work, Einstein argued
that under certain circumstances radiant energy itself seemed to consist of
quanta (light quanta, later called photons), and in 1907 he showed the
generality of the quantum hypothesis by using it to interpret the
temperature dependence of the specific heats of solids. In 1909 he
introduced the wave-particle duality into physics. In October 1911 he was
among the group of prominent physicists who attended the first Solvay
conference in Brussels. The discussions there stimulated Henri Poincaré to
provide a mathematical proof that Planck's radiation law necessarily
required the introduction of quanta--a proof that converted James (later Sir
James) Jeans and others into supporters of the quantum theory. In 1913 Niels
Bohr also contributed greatly to its establishment through his quantum
theory of the hydrogen atom. Ironically, Planck himself was one of the last
to struggle for a return to classical theory, a stance he later regarded not
with regret but as a means by which he had thoroughly convinced himself of
the necessity of the quantum theory. Opposition to Einstein's radical light
quantum hypothesis of 1905 persisted until after the discovery of the
Compton effect in 1922.
</p>

<CENTER>Later life</CENTER></p>

Planck was 42 years old in 1900 when he made the famous discovery that in
1918 won him the Nobel Prize for Physics and that brought him many other
honours. It is not surprising that he subsequently made no discoveries of
comparable importance. Nevertheless, he continued to contribute at a high
level to various branches of optics, thermodynamics and statistical
mechanics, physical chemistry, and other fields. He was also the first
prominent physicist to champion Einstein's special theory of relativity
(1905). "The velocity of light is to the Theory of Relativity," Planck
remarked, "as the elementary quantum of action is to the Quantum Theory; it
is its absolute core." In 1914 Planck and the physical chemist Walther
Hermann Nernst succeeded in bringing Einstein to Berlin, and after the war,
in 1919, arrangements were made for Max von Laue, Planck's favourite
student, to come to Berlin as well. When Planck retired in 1928, another
prominent theoretical physicist, Erwin Schrödinger, the originator of wave
mechanics, was chosen as his successor. For a time, therefore, Berlin shone
brilliantly as a centre of theoretical physics--until darkness enveloped it
in January 1933 with the ascent of Adolf Hitler to power.
</p>

In his later years, Planck devoted more and more of his writings to
philosophical, aesthetic, and religious questions. Together with Einstein
and Schrödinger, he remained adamantly opposed to the indeterministic,
statistical worldview introduced by Bohr, Max Born, Werner Heisenberg, and
others into physics after the advent of quantum mechanics in 1925-26. Such a
view was not in harmony with Planck's deepest intuitions and beliefs. The
physical universe, Planck argued, is an objective entity existing
independently of man; the observer and the observed are not intimately
coupled, as Bohr and his school would have it.
</p>

Planck became permanent secretary of the mathematics and physics sections of
the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1912 and held that position until 1938;
he was also president of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society (now the Max Planck
Society) from 1930 to 1937. These offices and others placed Planck in a
position of great authority, especially among German physicists; seldom were
his decisions or advice questioned. His authority, however, stemmed
fundamentally not from the official appointments he held but from his
personal moral force. His fairness, integrity, and wisdom were beyond
question. It was completely in character that Planck went directly to Hitler
in an attempt to reverse Hitler's devastating racial policies, and that he
chose to remain in Germany during the Nazi period to try to preserve what he
could of German physics.
</p>

Planck was a man of indomitable will. Had he been less stoic, and had he had
less philosophical and religious conviction, he could scarcely have
withstood the tragedies that entered his life after age 50. In 1909, his
first wife, Marie Merck, the daughter of a Munich banker, died after 22
years of happy marriage, leaving Planck with two sons and twin daughters.
The elder son, Karl, was killed in action in 1916. The following year,
Margarete, one of his daughters, died in childbirth, and in 1919 the same
fate befell Emma, his other daughter. World War II brought further tragedy.
Planck's house in Berlin was completely destroyed by bombs in 1944. Far
worse, the younger son, Erwin, was implicated in the attempt made on
Hitler's life on July 20, 1944, and in early 1945 he died a horrible death
at the hands of the Gestapo. That merciless act destroyed Planck's will to
live. At war's end, American officers took Planck and his second wife, Marga
von Hoesslin, whom he had married in 1910 and by whom he had had one son, to
Göttingen. There, on October 4, 1947, in his 89th year, he died. Death, in
the words of James Franck, came to him "as a redemption."
