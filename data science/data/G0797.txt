      <P><B>May 21, 1999</B>: When the Galileo spaceprobe <a href="ast05may99_1.htm">flew by Jupiter's
      moon Callisto</a> earlier this month, the detection of life on that strange
      and distant world was not among the scientific objectives. After
      all, Callisto's heavily cratered surface is a frigid -220<sup>o</sup>
      F and is scarcely protected from the ravages of space by a extraordinarily
      thin CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Indeed most astrobiologists concur
      that Callisto is an unlikely abode for life. <BR>
<BR>
      But even if Callisto was wet and warm and teeming with life,
      would Galileo have noticed? The question brings to mind an earlier
      Galileo flyby of another curious planet -- Earth. <BR>

      When the Galileo spaceprobe swooped by Earth in 1990, all its
      instruments were pointed towards us. As Galileo flew toward our
      planet, the Earth was centered in the windshield and then again
      in the rear-view mirror as Galileo continued on its journey to
      Jupiter. <BR>
<BR>
      Galileo's close encounter with Earth framed one of the most difficult
      questions in astrobiology: <BR>
<BR>
      Can a modern space instrument tell if the Earth, or any planet,
      is a good candidate for harboring life? </P>

      on temperature, pressure or chemical environment for living matter
      are geocentric myths.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
      </FONT></center>


To put the 1990 flyby in perspective, the late
      Carl Sagan and his colleagues published a 1993 <I>Nature</I>
      article on this question. According to Sagan, the Galileo spacecraft
      found clear signs of life during its flight past the earth including:

      <OL>
        <LI>strong absorption of light at the red end of the visible
        spectrum, particularly over the continents. The light-absorbing
        pigment that causes this is <B>chlorophyl</B>, a molecule essential
        to plant life and photosynthesis. (Plants appear green because
        chlorophyl reflects green light and absorbs red and blues.)
        <LI>spectral absorption features caused by molecular oxygen in
        Earth's atmosphere. The amount of O<sub>2</sub> in our atmosphere
        is many orders of magnitude greater than is found on any other
        planet in the Solar System. <B>An oxygen-rich atmosphere</B>
        is a curiosity because oxygen slowly combines with rocks on the
        earth's surface. Maintaining the oxygen content requires some
        replenishing mechanism, in this case photosynthesis by plants
        -- the action of life.
        <LI>infrared spectral lines caused by methane in the atmosphere.
        Although the amount of <B>methane</B> Galileo saw was miniscule
        -- about 1 part per million -- it is still important. In a oxygen-rich
        atmosphere like Earth's, methane should rapidly oxidize into
        water and CO<sub>2</sub>. Not a single molecule of methane would
        remain in equilibrium. Biological action such as bacterial metabolism
        in bogs replenishes the supply.
        <LI>modulated narrowband <B>radio transmissions</B>. These emissions
        look nothing like natural sources of radio waves like lightning
        and plasma instabilities in Earth's magnetosphere. They are clear
        signs of a technological civilization.
      </OL>

      <P>Galileo's flyby of Earth was just the beginning of the first-ever
      control experiment in astrobiological remote sensing. The second
      part happened two years later, in 1992, when Galileo returned
      for a flyby of the moon. <BR>

      is the extensive blue and orange area on the left, and white

      were used to make three separate exposures, combined in an exaggerated
      color scheme to emphasize composition differences - blue hues

      While Earth is known to be teeming with life, the Moon is believed
      to be the exact opposite -- cold, barren, and lifeless throughout
      its long geological history. What did Galileo see when it passed
      by the moon? <BR>
<BR>
      &quot;Nothing,&quot; says David Noever, a NASA astrobiologist.
      &quot;There was no evidence for life. No chlorophyll, no oxygen-methane
      atmosphere, no artificial radio transmissions. It was just as
      we would have expected, and consistent with the Sagan criteria.&quot;

      <H2>Caveat Lunar</H2>

      <P>The Galileo flybys showed that we know how to identify life
      at a distance, at least the kinds of life we're familiar with
      here on Earth. However, things may not be as simple as they seem.
      Organic compounds have been discovered in some unlikely -- and
      almost certainly lifeless -- places, including amino acids in
      meteorites, organic molecules in interstellar clouds, and organic
      compounds called porphyrins in lunar soil. <BR>

<BR>
      The example of <A HREF="../development/sagan_ref3.htm">porphyrins
      on the Moon</A> is particulary intriguing in the context of the
      Galileo flybys and Sagan's subsequent criteria for life. Porphyrins
      are the building blocks of brightly pigmented biomolecules such
      as hemoglobin and chlorophyll which reflect only certain wavelengths
      of visible light. Chlorophylls, for example, are greenish pigments
      which contain a porphyrin ring. This is a stable ring-shaped
      molecule around which electrons are free to migrate. Because
      the electrons move freely, the ring has the potential to gain
      or lose electrons easily, and thus the potential to provide energized
      electrons to other molecules. This is the fundamental process
      by which chlorophyll captures or harvests the energy of sunlight--a
      kind of powerstation molecule underlying all life seen on earth.
<BR>
<BR>
      The first 3 of Sagan's 4 criteria for life, as gleaned from Galileo's
      Earth flyby, are all related to porphyrins through the action
      of chlorophyll. Chlorophyll and photosynthesis are responsible
      for the spectral colors of plant-covered continents, for the
      oxygen content of the atmosphere and for its methane balance.
      Galileo didn't detect porphyrins during its flyby of the Moon,
      but they were there in quantities too small to see. <BR>
<BR>
      <IMG SRC="../development/images/astrochem/porphy.gif" HEIGHT="114"

       FACE="arial,helvetica">Right</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="arial,helvetica">:
      Porphyrin molecules seem fully capable of biological wizardry
      on Earth. Put an iron atom in a porphyrin and the closely related
      oxygen-carrying blood molecule, hemoglobin, results. Put a magnesium
      atom in a porphyrin and the closely-related light-harvesting
      molecule, chlorophyll, is made. Put lunar soil specimen, 12023,
      into the lab for chemical analysis, and porphyrin shows up on
      the moon. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
      Here on Earth porphyrin organic compounds are useful biomarkers.
      For example, petroleum hunters look for porphyrins as markers
      of oil deposits and thermal maturity. They can be detected remotely
      without extracting organic matter to reveal oil shales and source
      rock that came from the decay of green plants. <BR>
<BR>
      Does the presence of porphyrins mean that there is or has been
      life on the Moon? <BR>
<BR>
      Not at all. The 1969 discovery of lunar porphyrins probably says
      less about the chances for biochemistry there, than about how
      common their generation may be elsewhere in the universe. In
      1978 Simionescu <I>et al.</I> were able to produce porphyrins
      under laboratory conditions similar to those of primaeval Earth,
      before the genesis of life. They summarized the results in the
      journal <I><A HREF="../development/sagan_ref2.htm">Origins of
      Life</A></I>: <BR>

      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>&quot;Experiments with gas mixtures intended to simulate the
        primaeval atmosphere of the Earth yielded many biologically important
        chemicals. Investigations into the synthesis of porphyrin-like
        compounds from methane, ammonia and water vapour were carried
        out by using high frequency discharges. Microanalyses of porphyrins
        showed that porphyrin-like pigments were formed in this way.
        The presence of divalent cations in the reaction system increased
        the yield of porphyrin-like pigments also involving the direct
        synthesis of their metal complexes. The ready formation of these
        compounds in abiotic conditions is significant, suggesting the
        possibility of their appearance during the early stage of chemical
        evolution.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

      The idea that the &quot;stuff of life&quot; is common even in
      lifeless places like the Moon is gaining momentum. On February
      19th of this year an article in <I>Science</I> magazine reported
      one group's attempt to mimic an organic chemistry lab in outer
      space. The research team included a new breed of astrochemists--including
      Scott Sandford at the NASA Ames Research Center and the SETI
      Institute, both in Mountain View, CA, and lead author of the
      <I>Science</I> paper, Max Bernstein of Stanford University. Their
      experiments involved a class of complex carbon and hydrogen molecules,
      called polyaromatic hydrocarbons, or &quot;PAHs.&quot; Like the
      porphyrins, these molecules are also part of the so-called CHNOPS
      elements--carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and
      sulfur. <BR>
<BR>
      To reproduce the chemistry of an interstellar molecular cloud,
      Bernstein's group followed a simple recipe:</P>

      <OL>
        <LI>mix carbon and hydrogen molecules, the PAHs, with water ice
        at minus 440 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature inside an interstellar
        cloud;&nbsp;
        <LI>place these ice grains in a vacuum;&nbsp;
        <LI>shine ultraviolet light on them, the same type of radiation
        put out by nearby stars and re-radiated by glowing hydrogen gases.

      </TABLE>Because of the extreme conditions, the likelihood of
      more complex, biologically useful molecules being formed seemed
      as remote as space itself. Instead, about 10 percent of the PAHs
      were converted to more biologically useful molecules such as
      alcohols, ketones and esters. <BR>
<BR>
      &quot;These experiments take molecules that only an astrophysicist
      could love and transform them into something that ought to fascinate
      astrobiologists,&quot; comments Thomas Wdowiak, an astrophysicist
      at University of Alabama at Birmingham. &quot;This shows there
      is a process that takes a rather abundant substance that exists
      in the universe and converts it to the kinds of things that are
      susceptible to the origin-of-life scenario.&quot; <BR>

      <H2>Earth as we, the aliens, might see it....</H2>

      <P>On Christmas Eve 1968, Apollo 8 completed 10 orbits around
      the Moon and returned live television pictures back to our planet.
      Over half a billion people watched as Earth rose on the Moon's
      horizon. For many observers it was a transforming perspective.
<BR>
<BR>
      Poet Archibald MacLeish wrote: &quot;. . . to see the earth as
      it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence
      where it floats, is to see ourselves as riders on the earth together....&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
      For astrobiologists, the Galileo flyby invoked a similar transformation
      -- a first-time view of the Earth as an alien world. It affirmed
      that standards of proof may be the most interesting -- and vexing
      -- piece of the puzzle in the search for life among the stars.
      Meanwhile, scientists continue to push the limits of their understanding
      of both the biological and pre-biotic envelope for life, as we
      might know it, and how we might see it remotely from space--even
      when looking back directly at ourselves.</P>
