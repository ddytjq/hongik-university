<p>AER stands for Annual Equivalent Rate and illustrates what the interest rate would be if interest was paid and added each year.</p>

<p>Tax-free means the rate of interest payable where interest paid is exempt from income tax.</p>

<p><b>Opening an Account</b></p>

<p>Progressive Building Society serves the community of Northern Ireland and only residents of the Province are eligible to open accounts. An exception to this policy is made in relation to Limited Issue Bond Accounts. Accounts can be opened in person at one of our 12 branches  or with any of our many agents throughout the length and breadth of Northern Ireland - just look for the Progressive sign!  Alternatively, just send for information on the account you want, complete the application that will be sent to you and send this to the branch of your choice together with your cheque.</p>

<p>You will be given a passbook to help you keep a record of your transactions and to enable you to pay money into your account at any time.  If you have opted for a fixed rate bond account you will receive a bond certificate as a record of your investment in lieu of a passbook.</p>

<p>In order to protect your interests and to comply with legislation, formal personal identification, such as a current driving licence or full passport, will be required when opening a new account.  Proof of your home address, such as a recent electricity bill, will also be needed.</p>

<p>Where required by legislation, interest will be paid or credited after deduction of income tax at the appropriate rate. Individuals who are non-taxpayers, and who have not registered to receive their interest without tax deducted, can claim a repayment of tax from the Inland Revenue.  Individuals with taxable income in the starting rate band of 10% who are due to pay less tax than the amount deducted from their interest can also claim such a repayment.</p>

<p>Individuals whose interest falls within the basic rate band will have no more tax to pay on their interest, as the tax deducted from it at 20% will satisfy the tax due.  Individuals who are higher rate taxpayers will have to pay the extra tax due on their interest (the difference between tax deducted at 20% and the higher rate of 40%). Inland Revenue registration forms and details of who may qualify to have interest paid without deduction of income tax are available from your local Progressive branch. If you are planning to open a joint account, it is possible for the interest to be paid in part without the deduction of tax and part with deduction at the appropriate rate. The Society is required each year to supply to the Inland Revenue particulars of all interest paid or credited to investors.</p>

<p>Progressive Building Society is a member of the Building Societies Association, the Building Societies Ombudsman Scheme, the Building Societies Investor Protection Scheme and subscribes to the Code of Banking Practice.  The Society is authorised for Trustee Investment.</p>

<p>The Building Societies Investor Protection Scheme was established under the Building Societies Act 1986.  Payments under this Scheme are limited to 90% of an investor's total shares and/or deposits subject to a maximum payment to any one investor of £18,000 (or 20,000 euro if greater).  Most share and deposit accounts held in sterling, other European Economic Area currencies and euro at offices of the building society in the UK and elsewhere within the European Economic Area are covered.  Further details are available on request from the Society.</p>
