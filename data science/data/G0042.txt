aberration issues inherent with the lenses of the cassegrain design. In addition, it
does not consider sensitivities to correlated double-perturbations of the optical 
elements of either system. The former, and quite possibly the latter, are crucial

<h3>Summary</h3>
The following are results for small, single-perturbations (i.e., one perturbation at 
a time) of the optical elements of each system.
<ul>
    <li>The optical element perturbations of the FAME Light cassegrain design 
        that cause the worst damage to RMS wavefront residuals have been identified.
        (The number of perturbations for the FAME Classic design is small in comparison, 
        so we consider all element perturbations for that system.)
        <p>
	<li>The FAME Classic design is most sensitive to tilts and displacements of the 
        primary and secondary mirrors. Tilts introduce significant field curvature 
        (proportional to the &quot;defocus&quot; terms below), distortion 
        (proportional to the &quot;tilt&quot; terms below), astigmatism, and 
        some coma. Piston produces severe defocus. This is easily seen at a glance 
        in the <a href="#CenterSensitivityMatrices">aberration sensitivity matrix</a>
        for the Classic design.
        <p>
    <li>The orientation and displacement sensitivities of the FAME Classic tertiary 
        mirror are comparatively benign, although piston error should not be ignored.
        <p>
    <li>The FAME Light cassegrain design is, in contrast to the Classic design, relatively insensitive 
        to perturbations of the primary and secondary mirrors, except for 
        strong defocus. Other than tilt and defocus, the only aberration that 
        tilts and decenters of the primary produce is a small amount of coma. This 
        is easily seen at a glance in the <a href="#CenterSensitivityMatrices">aberration 
        sensitivity matrix</a> for the cassegrain design.  Generally, the cassegrain 
        design is less sensitive to perturbations of the mirrors than the Classic 
        design.  (However, the cassegrain design contains lenses, which bring with 
        them a host of other problems.)
        <p>
    <li>The cassegrain design is very sensitive to changes in index of refraction 
        of the lenses, especially for lens 2. Index error produces strong defocus.
        <p>
    <li>The cassegrain design is very sensitive to changes in the radii of curvature 
        of the lens surfaces, especially for lens 1 (strong defocus).
        <p>
    <li>Differences in the aberration coefficient sensitivities between the center
        and edge of the exit pupil (diagonal field offset of 0.5 degrees) were also
        calculated.
        <p>
    <li>At the off-center field location, the set of aberration sensitivities taken 
        as a whole gets worse. This is true for both designs. See the 
        <a href="#EdgeSensitivityMatrices">sensitivity matrices for the off-center field</a>.
        Sensitivity matrices of the <a href="#EdgeSensitivityDiffsMatrices"><i>changes</i> 
        in the sensitivities</a> shows this even more clearly.
        <p>
    <li>Which design is &quot;better&quot;? It depends on many tradeoffs.  The 
        purpose of this study is to provide quantitative information regarding the 
        sensitivities of aberration coefficients to the &quot;worst offender&quot; 
        optical element perturbations, as a means for helping make an informed decision.

<h3>What is <u>NOT</u> covered in this study</h3>
The first two items in this list apply to both designs.  The beamwalk issue may be 
compounded in the cassegrain design due to the passage of light through several 
glass elements. The remaining items apply only to the cassegrain design.

    <p>
	<li>Chromatic aberrations.</li>
    <p>
	<li>Index of refraction and dispersion inhomogeneities within a lens. (I am told 
        that index inhomogeneities within a fused silica lens might be as good as 
        one part per million.)</li>
    <p>
	<li>Lateral displacements of the individual lens surfaces (with respect to 
        the other surface of the same lens). These are identified in this study as
        being important sensitivities for the cassegrain design.</li>
    <p>
	<li>Piston of the individual lens surfaces (holding the other surface of the 
        same lens fixed).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Beamwalk Illustration</h3>

In a continuance of one of the issues not covered in this study proper, I would 
like to briefly mention (but not study here) the beamwalk issue.  Refer to Figures 1 
and 2 below. 
<p>
Light from the two rectangular entrance apertures does not fully 
illuminate the optical elements of either FAME design. Thus, images of the entrance 
apertures appear in various places on the various optical elements, depending on 
the particular element in question and on the field offset from the optical axis. 
Light from stars in different locations in field of view will then strike different 
parts of the mirrors and/or traverse different segments of lens glass. Similarly, 
as the satellite spins, light from the same star will sample different locations on 
the optical elements. 
<p>
The data reduction team is required to centroid PSFs at the focal plane to less than 
of order 1/350 of a pixel, in order to meet the science goal of order 50 microarcseconds 
by the end of the mission. Due to beamwalk, this severe centroiding requirement 
places correspondingly severe constraints on the accuracy of the surface 
figures (especially the mirrors), the homogeneity of the surface properties 
(e.g. roughness), and, in the case of lenses, the homogeneity of the glass 
properties (index of refraction, dispersion, and transparency). Related to this is
the corresponding need to keep a lid on thermal gradients across the optics, which 
can be only partially ameliorated by the use of low-CTE materials for the optics. 
<p>
Thus, a study of beamwalk needs to be done.

field location since FAME combines the light from two rectangular entrance apertures).
Notice that the same ray bundles sample different parts of different optical 
elements. Elements from the cassegrain design were used for illustration purposes 
only in this and in Figure 2; beamwalk problems affect both designs.

where rays from the same four field locations strike. Imagine these patches, representing 
light from four different stars in the FOV, traversing the lens in the long-patch-dimension 
direction as the spacecraft spins on its axis.  Blue is the bore-sight field, red 
is from the field offset 0.5 degrees cross-scan, green is from the field offset 0.5 
degrees in-scan, and yellow is from the field offset diagonally 0.5 degrees.  These 
four field locations are the same ones used throughout the rest of this study. 
(However, light from only one entrance aperture is used for the rest of this study.)

<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
The FAME Light Cassegrain and the FAME Classic designs are examined in the presence
of small misalignments of the optical elements of each system.  For each design, 
first the most sensitive misalignments were identified by means of a tolerance 
analysis.  In the tolerance analysis, the RMS wavefront error, as determined by 
sampling from a radial grid of 50 points (5 rings, 10 radial arms), was used as 
the merit function.  Elements and surfaces were displaced by 10 microns and tilted 
by 10 arc seconds.  For lenses, the refractive index was twiddled by 0.001. 
&quot;Surface irregularities&quot; consisted of 1/20 of a wave aberration split 
evenly between spherical and astigmatism.  The following table shows only the most 
damaging misalignments, grouped by type, in descending order of severity under 
each type. The complexity of the FAME Light cassegrain design necessitates  
ranking of the misalignments in order to identify the most serious ones. 
The corresponding table for the FAME Classic design is not shown. Since that 
design has only three powered mirrors, all misalignment sensitivities will be calculated.

<p><br>
<a name="CassOffenders"></a>
<h3>The Most Significant Cassegrain Misalignments</h3>
In terms of RMS wavefront error, misalignment types cannot be directly 
compared to other misalignment types since 
the magnitude of the wavefront errors depends on the magnitude of the type 
variation. For example, it makes no sense to vary tilts by, say, 10 arc seconds 
and decenters by, say, 100 microns, and then &quot;discover&quot; that decenter 
of the secondary mirror is &quot;more important&quot; than tilt of the primary. 
Once the worst offenders of each misalignment type have been identified by a 
tolerance analysis, one then must calculate sensitivities (i.e., derivatives) 
for each worst offender before comparisons can meaningfully be made across 
misalignment type or between optical designs. 
<p>
(Note: by &quot;changes in index of refraction&quot; in the context of this study, 
I mean uniform changes in index of the lens as a whole. I do not have access to 
software that would allow studying either index or dispersion inhomogeneities 
<i>within</i> a lens.)

<a name="WavefrontDescriptions"></a>
<h3>Wavefront Descriptions of the Two Designs</h3>
One can represent a wavefront at the exit pupil with an expansion in Zernike circle
polynomials.  Zernike polynomials are a complete orthonormal set, so any wavefront 
error can, with enough terms, be represented completely with no residual error.  
The low-order Zernike terms correspond approximately to the classical Seidel 
aberrations.  For information on the representation of wavefront errors with Zernike polynomials, see 
<a href="../../../AESOP/Papers/SAOTechMemos/ZernikeExpansion01.html" target="new">Murison (1995)</a>.  
For a list of the terms considered in this study and shown in the tables below, 
there is a <a href="#ZernikeTerms">reference table at the end of this document</a>.
<p>
The Zernike expansion is a fit to the exit pupil wavefront, incorporating the
entrance pupil position dependencies into the Zernike expansion coefficients.  
Hence, for example, the Seidel distortion, which has a cubic dependence on 
position in the object plane, has also a linear dependence in the exit pupil 
position and is therefore proportional to the &quot;tilt&quot; coefficients given below.  
Similarly, the field curvature object plane quadratic dependence is incorporated 
into the Zernike &quot;defocus&quot; term, which is also quadratic in the exit pupil position.
<p>
Unfortunately, the <a href="http://www.focus-software.com/zemax/" target="new">Zemax</a> 
calculation of Seidel aberrations is accurate only with paraxial systems. 
Neither of the two designs considered here is paraxial, and I found that indeed the 
Zemax Seidel calculations for both designs are unreliable.  Thus, only Zernike coefficient 
calculations, which are reliable and accurate in Zemax, are shown here.
<p>  
The table below lists the values of the Zernike wavefront expansion coefficients 
for the two designs in their unperturbed state (i.e., ideal optics) for a field position 
on the optical axis.  Terms are included up to the sixth-order spherical aberration 
term.  The first row of each design contains the low-order aberrations, while the 
second row contains the next-higher-order set of terms. Definitions of the 
nomenclature (tilt_x, trefoil_y, etc.) are listed in the 
<a href="#ZernikeTerms">Zernike reference table</a>.

<p>
It is interesting to note the changes in the coefficients as the optical systems 
are slightly perturbed.  For example, if we tilt the primary mirror in each design 
by 10 arc seconds around the X axis (the X axis is parallel to the scan direction), 
we find the following:

</table>
<p>
For the FAME Classic design, we see that tilting the primary mirror produces large 
amounts of defocus, astigmatism, and coma, plus a small amount of spherical aberration.  
For the cassegrain, tilting the primary mirror introduces primarily coma and very little else. 
In this manner, one may approximate the derivatives of the Zernike coefficients 
with respect to various small perturbations of the optical elements of each design.

<h3>Sensitivities at the Center of the Field</h3>
As previously mentioned, one may approximate the derivatives of the Zernike coefficients 
with respect to various small perturbations of the optical elements of each design.
In what follows, coefficient values in the presence of a specified small perturbation 
were subtracted from the values under perfect alignment, then divided by the 
perturbation. 
<p>
The resulting table of values can be represented visually as a color mapping, 
with the color of each table cell corresponding to the magnitude of the sensitivity 
calculated for that cell. The resulting color mappings make it much easier to determine, 
at a glance, qualitative characteristics and behavior than the corresponding large 
tables of numbers. (The tables of numbers are also presented below, after the 
color mappings.)

<h5>Aberration Sensitivity Matrices</h5><br>
Below are color mappings that represent matrices of the derivatives of the Zernike 
wavefront expansion coefficients for the boresight field for each system. 
See the next two subsections, respectively, for detailed information. The functional

<h5>&quot;FAME Light&quot; Cassegrain Sensitivities</h5><br>
The table below lists the derivatives of the Zernike wavefront expansion coefficients
for a beam at the center of the FOV, with respect to displacements (change per 
micron), tilts (change per arc second),  index of refraction (change per 0.000003 
change in index of the lens as a whole), and radius of curvature (change per micron), 
for the FAME Light Cassegrain design. The perturbations were taken from the table of 
<a href="#CassOffenders">&quot;worst offenders&quot;</a> above. Derivatives listed 
are approximations calculated by dividing the change in each coefficient after 
a given perturbation by the perturbation amount.  Perturbations were 10 microns, 
10 arc seconds, 0.00003, and 10 microns for displacements, tilts, index of refraction, 
and radius of curvature, respectively. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Numbers

<h5>Sensitivity Ratios</h5><br>
Ratios of the sensitivities of the primary and secondary mirror perturbations are 
shown in the table below. In every case of a large ratio, the two numbers involved 
are small and therefore unimportant (compare with the two preceding tables). Hence, 
we conclude that tolerances to primary and secondary mirror displacements 
and tilts are significantly looser for the cassegrain design, compared to the 
&quot;all-mirror&quot; design. Note that this table says nothing about the relative 
severity of the sensitivities to lens perturbations, which affect the 
cassegrain design and not the Classic design.

<h3>Changes in the Sensitivities 0.5 Degrees Diagonally from the Center of the Field</h3>
The first three subsections which follow are the same as the first three subsections 
of the <a href="#CenterSensitivities">previous section</a>, but for a field location 
0.5 degrees away from the center of the FOV, diagonally between the scan and 
cross-scan directions. The <a href="#EdgeSensitivityDiffsMatrices">last subsection 
of this section</a> presents the differences in the sensitivities between the 
two field locations (boresight and 0.5-degree offset).

<h3>On the Index of Refraction for Fused Silica</h3>
A note is in order about index of refraction. For fused silica, the typical error 
in index due to fabrication processes is 0.00003, which is the value I used above 
for the index perturbations. I obtained this from the 
<a href="http://www.luxpop.com/" target="new">Luxpop web site</a>:
<br>
<blockquote>The index of refraction of pure UV-grade synthetic fused silica (UVGSFS) at 
25.00&deg;C for a wavelength of 550&nbsp;nm is  
n&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.45997&nbsp;&plusmn;&nbsp;3&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>-5</sup>.
Note: another name for synthetic fused silica is silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>). 
Values may vary considerably depending on fabrication. Thin films may have 
different index of refraction values when compared to bulk components. Luxpop 
is working on acquiring typical values for different fabrication processes.
Reference: I. H. Malitson, "Interspecimen comparison of the refractive index 
of fused silica," J. Opt. Soc. Am. 55, no. 10 (October 1965), pp. 1205-1209.
Answer obtained using the dispersion formula at 20&deg;C in the reference then 
modifying given a dn/dT of 1.28&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>-5</sup>/&deg;C for UVGSFS. This is 
valid for small changes about room temperature.</blockquote>

I do not know how relevant a whole-lens index error of 0.00003 is to what may 
actually be expected for the glass available to FAME. In addition, as previously 
mentioned, this study does not consider refractive index or dispersion inhomogeneities 
<i>within</i> a lens.

<h3>Zernike Expansion Terms</h3>
The Zernike expansion coefficients considered in this study are the coefficients of 
the following functional forms. <span class="sym">r</span> is normalized radius, 
spanning the range [0,1], and <span class="sym">j</span> is azimuthal angle. Thus, the 
<a href="../../../AESOP/Papers/SAOTechMemos/ZernikeExpansion01.html" target="new">Zernike expansion</a> 
is in terms of radial and azimuthal modes. For an interactive graphical view of 
various Zernike terms (and combinations of terms), go to

Wyant's interactive Zernike Polynomials web page</a>.
