        opening amount is &pound;500.00. The maximum amount is &pound;500,000

        7. Cheques can normally be accepted for six months following the date 
        they are drawn.<br>
        8. Cash and cheque deposits can be made at any branch. A handling fee 
        representing 10% of the total value of coins deposited will be charged 
        if the value is &pound;20.00 or more.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Cooling-off

      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">9. If within 
        16 days of opening your account you decide that this account is not suitable 
        for you, if you write to us and advise us of this we will either, transfer 
        the account to another Dudley Account or arrange to return the balance 
        plus interest to you, whichever you prefer. There will be no penalty charges 
        and if you require the funds to be repaid this will be by cheque payable 
        to the account holder(s). Funds will not be returned to the account holder(s) 
        until cheques have cleared which will take a period of up to 14 days.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Interest</u></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">10. The interest 
        rates payable on your account are variable and we may change the rate 
        of interest at any time for any valid reason.<br>
        11. When we change the interest rates, we will tell you about the changes 
        at the earliest opportunity but at least within 3 working days of the 
        change:<br>
        (i) by general notice in our branches<br>
        (ii) by notice in newspapers of our choice. The newspapers we usually 
        use are the Express and Star and Dudley News Group showing our previous 
        and new interest rates.<br>
        Annually we will send you a summary of our products and the current rates 
        and all the different interest rates which have applied to your account 
        during the year (unless the account balance is below &pound;100).<br>
        12. You can find out what interest rates apply to your account at anytime 
        by contacting any of our Branches or Head Office on (01384) 231414.<br>
        13. Interest will be payable after deduction of income tax at the rate 
        required by law or subject to the required Registration, gross (i.e. without 
        tax deduction). Tax (if any) may be reclaimed from the Inland Revenue 
        where the amount deducted exceeds your liability to tax.<br>

        to your account although the Society requires up to 14 days before a cheque 
        will be cleared.<br>
        15. Interest is calculated on a daily basis up to the day of withdrawal. 
        If you require an explanation of how your interest is calculated please 
        ask your local Branch or contact Head Office. A written explanation will 
        be posted to you within a few days of your request.<br>

        provide sufficient information for this transmission. In the event of 
        insufficient information, interest will be credited to the account.<br>
        17. Interest will be paid annually on the 31st March or monthly on balances 
        over &pound;10,000, if preferred.<br>
        18. Higher rates of interest are paid as your savings rise above &pound;10,000, 
        &pound;25,000, &pound;50,000 and &pound;100,000.<br>

        each day, subject to 7 days notice being given to us or a penalty of 7 
        days interest being charged to you providing you have the available funds 
        in your account.<br>
        22. We reserve the right not to pay withdrawals from cheques received 
        until up to 14 days have elapsed.<br>
        23. Cheques withdrawn and subsequently returned for saving will earn interest 
        from the date they are received by the Society.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Ownership 
        and Responsibilities</u></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">24. Two or 
        more persons (maximum four) may jointly open an account. You may choose 
        the order of names on the account. Only the first named will be entitled 
        to attend meetings and vote, if eligible in accordance with the Society's 
        Rules. All correspondence will be sent to the registered address of the 
        first named holder.<br>
        25. In the case of a joint account in one or more names, all holders are 
        jointly and severally bound by the rules of the Society.<br>
        26. For joint accounts, funds are held on the basis of joint beneficial 
        ownership.<br>
        27. In the event of a death, the account balance and accrued interest 
        is payable to your personal representatives. In the event of the death 
        of a joint account holder, the survivor(s) will be person(s) recognised 
        by us as having any title to, or interest in the account.<br>
        28. Where an account is opened in the names of more than one person, on 
        death the balance will automatically pass to remaining account holder(s). 
        If the parties on an account decide to separate, you must advise the Society 
        immediately, as otherwise the account will continue to be operated in 
        accordance with current instructions. If there is a dispute between any 
        parties on the account and we are notified of this, the account will be 
        &quot;frozen&quot; and no withdrawals will be allowed by any party to 
        the account until the matter has been clarified to our satisfaction.</font></p>

        giving any reason, repay to you, all or part of your savings at any time 
        after giving you at least 30 days notice.<br>
        32. We reserve the right to close any issue of the account to new savers, 
        without individually notifying each account holder.<br>
        33. You may subject to the terms of issue of your account and to our prior 
        approval, transfer your savings to another person. No transfer will be 
        valid unless made in a form approved by us and until registered in our 
        records. We may refuse to permit such a transfer without giving any reason.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Passbook</u></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">34. We will 
        provide you with a passbook, but it will remain our property and must 
        be returned to us on request. Your passbook must be forwarded to us, at

        purposes as we may require.<br>
        35. Your passbook must accompany any withdrawal and any further saving.<br>
        36. If your passbook has an entry which seems to be wrong, you should 
        tell us as soon as possible so we can resolve matters.<br>
        37. You must immediately notify us by contacting any of Branches or Head 
        Office on (01384) 231414 if you discover that your passbook is missing. 
        You must then confirm this in writing. After you have provided such evidence 
        regarding the loss, and given any indemnity and paid such fee (if any) 
        which we may require, we may transfer the amount in the account to a replacement 
        passbook after seven days have elapsed. If someone other than you, produces 
        your passbook to us, pretends to be you or to be authorised by you, and 
        is therefore able to withdraw money from your account, you will be liable 
        for the amount of any withdrawals if you have acted fraudulently or with 
        gross negligence.<br>
        38. The passbook will remain our property and must be returned to us on 
        request. Your passbook must be forwarded to us at such times as we may 
        decide, to be brought up to date or for such other purposes as we may 
        require.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Retention 
        and Set-Off</u></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">39. Provided 
        we give notice in writing, we have the right to retain and set-off all 
        money in any account you hold with us against any indebtedness you may 
        have to us, whether under a mortgage, guarantee or otherwise, which is 
        due for payment or Repayment, but has not been paid or repaid as the case 
        may be. Interest or bonuses will not be paid on any money used in this

        terms of which similar accounts are offered by other financial institutions).<br>

        (c) To improve efficiency and/or reduce costs.<br>
        (d) To give extra benefit to savers (including making the terms of the 
        account easier to understand).<br>
        (e) To take account of changes in the law, decisions of the Ombudsman, 
        Regulator or similar person or any code of practice with which we intend 
        to comply;<br>
