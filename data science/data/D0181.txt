<p><b><u>E-mail:</u></b> unknown
<P><b><u>Question:</u></b> I tried to get color on my web page, but it's not working for some reason. I checked out the HTML codes to see if I made a mistake. Everything is typed in correctly. Did I do something wrong that I don't know about?
<br>
<br>
<p><b><u>Answer:</u></b> You may have. Go through the BODY line thoroughly. It may be as simple as not ending the code with " or >. Try checking for either of those missing items. If you ended that line with " and >, check the lines above that one. Any line not ending properly will affect every line after it.

<P><b><u>Question:</u></b> If anyone knows of a good site for programming language compilers, I'd like to know where to find them. I'm looking for
something that is user-friendly. 
<br>
<br>
<p><b><u>Answer:</u></b> Sorry everyone. I've found a good compiler for Java. Now I would like to find one for C and C++. For those who want to
learn Java, follow along with me as I learn it by clicking on "Lots of Links" on the menu to the left, then click the link "Learning
Java". If you have any questions, come back here and I will answer them.

<P><b><u>Question:</u></b> I've just got into web design and I'm having some probs. What happens is that when I access my site it looks and runs ok. Then when I try to open a page it shuts my system down. Any help please? 
<br>
<br>
<p><b><u>Answer:</u></b> It may be that you don't have enough memory to run on the internet. It may also be the server where your page is. It could even be you need a different browser. Try taking a look at those options first, if they're not the problem, get back to me. Learning in the beginning can be hard if the things I've mentioned above aren't working right.

<P><b><u>Question:</u></b> I recently made a site and it only contains one page. I don't know how to go back and edit that page. Please help!
<br>
<br>
<p><b><u>Answer:</u></b> When you log in to Geocities, after you hit Submit, you will see a link that says File Manager. Click on that, click on the next link to the File Manager, then click on  one of the pencil icons next to the files you have created.

<P><b><u>Question:</u></b> I'm running out of space and need more room to finish the site that I'm building. Last night I tried to start another site on Geocities so I could link them together. I was in the Page Bulider of the original site finishing a page, when I went to save it, it put all the information(pictures and text) into the new site that wasn't even open! Is it not possible to have 2 web sites and link them together?
<br>
<br>
<p><b><u>Answer:</u></b> Not in Geocities. I had two pages a while back and someone from Geocities told me I had to choose which one I wanted to save and e-mail them with the address of the one I wanted to delete. If you need more space for your site, you have to purchase more space.

<P><b><u>Question:</u></b> I have some java applets uploaded, and embedded, with all the classes etc. but when I try to view the website, it says in the status bar something like pass1.class cannot be found, when it is obviously in the right place.
<br>
<br>
<p><b><u>Answer:</u></b> You don't want to EMBED your Java applets, you want to use the APPLET tags to call your applet class. It should be something like APPLET CODE="pass1.class" WIDTH=50 HEIGHT=50
Try seeing if you typed that tag pair wrong. The EMBED tags are for music and other multimedia files.

<p><b><u>E-mail:</u></b> unknown
<P><b><u>Question:</u></b> I am building my website on geocities and have a couple of pages done but when I type in the url on any of the search engines, its says page not found. Why ? I have made a index.html, at least theres one showing in file manager. The only way I can see my pages is to go to filemanger where I'm working on them. No one else can get to them. I need help ,please. Thanks Patty
<br>
<br>
<p><b><u>Answer:</u></b> Are you typing the URL in a search engine like Yahoo or Excite, or are you typing the URL in the location (address) bar at the top of your screen. Search engines are created to look for something like "JavaScript pages". The location (address) bar under your Back and Forward buttons is where you type the URL. Also, make sure that you didn't rename the index.html file.

<P><b><u>Question:</u></b> How do I use frames on my geocities site? I would prefere to use pagebuilder to do this if its possible.
<br>
<br>
<p><b><u>Answer:</u></b> I don't know about Page Builder, but creating frames from scratch is not hard at all. In your "index.html" page, where you would normally place the BODY and /BODY tags, type FRAMESET COLS="25%,*"

Then, between that and the /FRAMESET tags, type FRAME SRC="name_of_page1.htm" NAME=FIRST

Under that, type FRAME SRC="name_of_page2.htm" NAME=SECOND

This will give you a split screen with one side wider than the other.

<P><b><u>Question:</u></b> How do I add another page onto my existing 
page? One page isn't big enough!!!! 
<br>
<br>
<p><b><u>Answer:</u></b> I don't know how Page Builder works, but I go into File Manager and if I need to create a new page, I click the New button. Then there's a box where I name the page and a larger box where I type my code. After I've saved the page, on my first page, I use the tag A HREF="MyNewPage.htm", then I type the name of the page followed by the /A tag. This will give you the name of the page that is underlined, both will be the color blue.

<P><b><u>Question:</u></b> How do i get music to play in the backround of my page while viewing it on the internet. I have tried downloading one of my Napster files, but since it is a "mp3" file it is unable to upload. Do i have to convert it, or do i have to find the song under something like "jpg". Please help. Thanks
<br>
<br>
<p><b><u>Answer:</u></b>Internet Explorer and Netscape use two different ways to run music. Below are the codes:<BR>
<BR>
IE<BR>
< BGSOUND SRC="mysong.wav" LOOP=1 ><BR>
<BR>
Netscape<BR>
< EMBED SRC="mysong.wav" WIDTH=0 HEIGHT=0 AUTOSTART="true" >

<P><b><u>Question:</u></b> I have a menu page set up with a frame, and everything looks great when I go to my page except for one problem. The frame is on the left side of the page, and I can't scroll down the options. Do I need to insert a scroll bar, and is that possible in HTML? I thought this would be done automatically.
<br>
<br>
<p><b><u>Answer:</u></b> I guess I'm trying to understand what you are saying. If you have a menu on the left, and it is too long, then the frame should automatically scroll, unless you told it not to by adding SCROLLING=NO in your FRAME tag (ex. FRAME SRC="menu.html" SCROLLING=NO).
