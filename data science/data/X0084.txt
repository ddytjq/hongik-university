<p><code><b>ARTICLE IV - ULTIMATE</b></code><code> </code></p>

<p><code>Comment: Ultimate is a team sport in which the team with
the higher point total at the end of the game wins. It is played
with two teams of seven players on a rectangular field with an
endzone at each end. A goal, worth 1 point, is scored when a
player/thrower passes the disc to a teammate and it is
successfully caught within the confines of the endzone his or her
team is attacking. The disc may be advanced solely by passing the
disc from one player to another. A player may not run while in
possession of the disc. While the team in possession of the disc
seeks to advance the disc toward the endzone it is attacking, the
opposing team seeks to thwart advancement and obtain possession
by forcing a turnover. A turnover results whenever a pass is
incomplete, caught or knocked down by an opposing player, touches
the ground at any point or is caught by a player out-of-bounds.
No overt contact or tackling is allowed. The sport is played on a
self-officiated basis, with no referees. All line violation,
possession and foul calls are made by the players on the playing
field. </code></p>

<ul>
    <li><code>401 Spirit of the Game: Ultimate has traditionally
        relied upon a spirit of sportsmanship which places the
        responsibility for fair play on the individual player
        himself. Highly competitive play is encouraged but never
        at the expense of mutual respect between players,
        adherence to the agreed-upon rules of the game or the
        basic joy of play. The purpose of the rules of ultimate
        is to provide a guideline which describes the way the
        game is played. It is assumed that no ultimate player
        will intentionally violate the rules; there are no harsh
        penalties for inadvertent infractions but, rather, a
        method for resuming play in a manner which simulates what
        would most likely have occurred had there been no
        infraction. </code></li>
    <li><code>402 Field of Play </code><ul>
            <li><code>402.01 Dimensions: The field of play
                consists of a 64 by 37 m </li>
                rectangle called the playing field, with an
                18 m by 37 m rectangle
                called an endzone aligned along each of the
                37 m sides. See figure 4.1. <p><img
                src=" http://www.wfdf.org/image4_1.jpg"
                align="center"> </code></li><p>
            <li><code>402.02 Surface: The playing field may have
                any surface, although well trimmed grass is
                suggested, which is essentially flat, free of
                obstructions and holes, and affords reasonable
                player safety. </code></li>
            <li><code>402.03 Goal Lines: Goal lines are lines
                which separate the playing field proper from the
                endzones and are part of the playing field
                proper. </code></li>
            <li><code>402.04 Perimeter Lines: Perimeter lines
                (sidelines and endlines) are lines separating the
                playing field from the out-of-bounds area and are
                not part of the playing field. </code></li>
            <li><code>402.05 Markers: The corners of the playing
                field proper and the endzones are marked by cones
                made of a brightly colored, flexible material. </code></li>
            <li><code>402.06 Restraining Line: A restraining line
                shall be established 5 m from the playing field
                to ensure that the sidelines remain clear during
                play. </code></li>
            <li><code>402.07 Line Markings: All lines shall be
                marked with a non-caustic material and shall be
                between  5 cm and 10 cm wide. </code></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><code>403 Equipment </code><ul>
            <li><code>403.01 Disc: Any flying disc may be used as
                long as it is acceptable to both team captains
                and meets the requirements set forth in Article I
                of the WFDF rules. If the captains cannot agree,
                a disc designated by the WFDF Ultimate Committee
                as an official disc for the event shall be used.
                If no such disc has been designated, any disc
                designated by the WFDF Ultimate Committee as an
                approved disc for ultimate play shall be used. If
                the teams cannot agree upon a specific approved
                disc for play, two options are available: </code><ol>
                    <li><code>each team shall supply the approved
                        disc(s) for one half
                        of the game using the disc flipping
                        method (104.03) to determine the order of
                        use; or; </code></li>
                    <li><code>if that solution is not acceptable
                        to both teams they shall resolve the
                        disagreement through the disc flipping
                        method. The team winning the flip shall
                        then supply the approved </code>
                        <code>disc(s)</code> <code>
                        for the entire game. </code></li>
                    <li> <code>Additional
                        spare discs (approved in accordance with
                        this section) may be held by any
                        officials to be used by the offense to
                        replace an out-of-bounds or damaged disc
                        at the offense's discretion. This rule is
                        limited to the following situations:
                        out-of-bounds pull receptions, between
                        points, during time-outs, or during
                        stoppages of play due to fouls or
                        violations. </code> </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><code>403.02 Protective Clothing: Players may
                wear any soft protective clothing so long as it
                does not endanger the safety of any other player.
                </code></li>
            <li><code>403.03 Uniform: The players of each team
                shall wear a uniform or other clothing that
                distinguishes them from the players of the other
                team. </code></li>
            <li><code>403.04 Cleats: Cleats are permitted;
                however, players may not use any cleats which
                have any metal exposed. </code></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><code>404 Rules of Play </code><ul>
            <li><code>404.01 Rule Variations: Any of these rules
                may be changed by mutual agreement of the
                captains of the two teams, subject to the
                approval of the tournament director. </code></li>
            <li><code>404.02 Length of Game: </code>
<code>A full-length game lasts
                until one team reaches a score of at least 19
                goals with a lead of at least two goals, or until
                a team scores 21 goals. There is to be a
                10-minute halftime when one team reaches 10
                goals. When tournament schedules or other
                circumstances make it necessary, games can be
                shorter. Guidelines on shorter game formats and
                how to cap games constricted by time can be found
                in the Tournament Directors' Manual published by
                the WFDF Ultimate Committee. </code> </li>
            <li><code>404.03 Time Outs: </code><ul>
                    <li><code>A. Non-Injury: Each team is
                        permitted two non-injury time-outs per
                        half in games to 17 or less, and three
                        non-injury time outs per half in games to
                        18 or more. Each team is permitted
                        exactly one time-out in overtime.
                        Overtime occurs when the score is tied at
                        one point less than the number of points
                        for which the game was originally
                        scheduled. </code><ol>
                            <li><code>Time to Call: A time-out
                                may be called by either team,
                                after a goal and prior to the
                                ensuing throw-off, or may be
                                called by the player in
                                possession of the disc during
                                play. </code></li>
                            <li><code>Duration: Time-outs shall

                        out-of-bounds area or contacts anything
                        which is out-of-bounds. The disc in
                        flight may pass over an out-of-bounds
                        area and return to the playing field

                        out-of-bounds area or anything which is
                        out-of-bounds. </code></li>

                        play on the disc. </code></li>
                    <li><code>C. Receiving Players: Receiving
                        players may not go out-of-bounds to make
                        a play on the disc. For a receiver to be
                        considered in-bounds at the time of

                        of the team gaining possession of the

                        perimeter line, and establish a pivot
                        foot at that point, not within the
                        perimeter line, before putting the disc

                        be put into play at the point on the

                        obtains possession in the endzone which

                        decision to either put the disc into play

                    <li><code>A. A player may become &quot;the
                        thrower&quot; by fielding a pull,
                        receiving the disc from a teammate,
                        intercepting a pass from an opponent, or
                        by picking up the disc after a turnover.
                        Whenever the disc is on the ground
                        following a turnover, whether in or

                        and become the thrower. A defensive
                        player who establishes possession of the
                        disc becomes the thrower, but may not
                        throw the disc before he or she
                        establishes a legal pivot foot. To do so
                        is a travelling violation. </code></li>
                    <li><code>B. Prior to releasing a throw, the
                        thrower must establish a pivot foot and
                        may not change that pivot foot until the
                        throw is released except in the case of
                        an offensive player who has just received
                        a pass and is throwing before the third
                        ground contact in accordance with
                        404.12(C). The thrower has the right to
                        pivot off the pivot foot in any
                        direction. However, once the marker has
                        established a legal position, the thrower
                        may not pivot into him. The thrower may
                        throw the disc in any manner and in any

                        defensive player may guard the thrower. A

                        if he or she is within 3 m of the

                        m of any other member of the offensive
                        team. A thrower guarded by more than one

                        immediately subtract 2 seconds from the
                        count and continue without interruption.
                        The second time this occurs is a foul and

                        within 3 m of the thrower, he or she may
                        initiate a count. This consists of the
                        marker calling, &quot;Stalling,&quot; and
                        then counting at one second intervals to
                        ten. If the thrower has not released the
                        disc by the first sound of the word
                        &quot;ten,&quot; then a change of
                        possession with a check shall result. If
                        during the stall count, the defense
                        switches markers, the new marker must
                        begin a new count at zero. In the event
                        of a stall, the once-marker, now
                        offensive player, does not have to take
                        the disc after the check. The
                        once-thrower, now marker, checks the disc
                        to the new thrower. If he or she does not
                        want the disc, the marker
                        &quot;checks&quot; the disc by placing it
                        on the ground and calling &quot;In

                        contact and control of a non-spinning
                        disc while the receiver is on the ground
                        and in-bounds. Loss of control due to
                        ground contact related to a pass
                        reception negates that receiver1s
                        possession up to that point. </code></li>
                    <li><code>B. Bobbling: Bobbling to gain
                        control of the disc is permitted, but
                        purposeful, controlled bobbling to
                        oneself in order to advance the disc is
                        considered traveling and is not allowed.
                        For purposes of this section, bobbling
                        shall include tipping, delaying, guiding
                        or brushing the disc. </code></li>
                    <li><code>C. Traveling: If the receiver is
                        moving when he or she catches a pass, he
                        or she shall be permitted the fewest
                        number of steps required to come to a
                        stop and establish a pivot foot. Further,
                        a receiver who catches the disc while
                        running or jumping may continue to run
                        and throw a pass so long as the throw is
                        released prior to the receiver making
                        three contacts with the ground and that
                        he or she makes no change in direction or
                        increase in speed during his or her

                    <li><code>D. Simultaneous Catch: If the disc
                        is caught simultaneously by offensive and
                        defensive players, the offense retains
                        possession. </code></li>
                    <li><code>E. Interception: A pass is
                        considered intercepted if a defensive
                        player catches a pass. If a defensive
                        player catches a pass and accidentally
                        loses possession of it before or during
                        ground contact related to that catch, the
                        defender is considered to have blocked
                        rather than intercepted the pass. </code></li>

                        such a manner that it is unclear whether
                        a catch was made before the disc made
                        contact with the ground (grass is
                        considered part of the ground), the
                        player with the best perspective shall
                        decide whether a good catch was made.
                        Further, if it is unclear whether a
                        receiver was in or out-of-bounds at the
                        point of making a catch, the player or
                        players with the best perspective makes
                        the call. </code></li>
                    <li><code>G. Force-Out Foul: If a receiver is
                        airborne at the time he or she takes
                        possession of the disc, and prior to
                        landing is contacted by a defensive
                        player, and said contact causes the
                        receiver to land out-of-bounds, the
                        receiver shall either call himself
                        out-of-bounds or call a force-out foul on
                        the defensive player. If this foul occurs
                        in the end zone and it is uncontested, a

                    <li><code>A. Definition: Fouls are the result
                        of physical contact between opposing
                        players. A foul may be called by the
                        player who has been fouled and must be
                        announced by calling out the word,
                        &quot;foul&quot; loudly and immediately
                        after the foul has occurred. </code></li>
                    <li><code>B. Responsibility: The player
                        initiating contact shall be the player
                        guilty of the foul. </code></li>
                    <li><code>C. Throwing Fouls: A throwing foul
                        may be called when there is contact
                        between the thrower and the marker, prior
                        to the release of the disc by the
                        thrower. Contact occurring during the
                        thrower's follow through is not
                        sufficient grounds for a foul, but should
                        still be avoided whenever possible. </code><ol>
                            <li><code>When a foul is committed by
                                the thrower or the marker, play
                                stops and possession reverts back
                                to the thrower, after a check. </code></li>
                            <li><code>If the thrower is fouled in
                                the act of throwing and the pass
                                is completed, the foul is
                                automatically declined and play
                                continues without interruption. </code></li>
                            <li><code>If the marker is fouled
                                during the thrower's act of
                                throwing and the pass is not
                                completed, play continues without
                                interruption. If the pass is
                                completed, the disc is returned
                                to the thrower after a check and
                                the stall count is resumed from
                                the point of interruption. </code></li>
                            <li><code>Should a foul or violation
                                result in possession reverting to
                                a thrower who was airborne while
                                releasing the disc, play shall be
                                restarted at the point on the
                                playing field proper closest to
                                the location from which the throw
                                was made. </code></li>

                    <li><code>D. Catching Fouls: A catching foul
                        may be called when there is contact
                        between opposing players in the process
                        of attempting a catch, interception or
                        knock down. A certain amount of
                        incidental contact during or immediately
                        after the catching attempt is often
                        unavoidable and shall not constitute a
                        foul. </code><ol>
                            <li><code>Interference: If a player
                                makes contact with an opponent
                                before the disc arrives and
                                therefore interferes with that
                                opponent's attempt to make a play
                                on the disc, that player has
                                committed a foul. </code></li>
                            <li><code>If a player's attempt to
                                make a play on the disc causes
                                contact with a
                                legitimately-positioned,
                                stationary opponent, either
                                before or after the disc arrives,
                                that player has committed a foul.
                                </code></li>
                            <li><code>If a catching foul occurs
                                and is uncontested, the player
                                fouled gains possession at the
                                point of the infraction. If the
                                call is disputed, possession of
                                the disc reverts back to the
                                thrower. If an uncontested foul,
                                with the exception of a force-out
                                foul (see 404.12 (F)), occurs in
                                the end zone the offensive team
                                is attacking, the player fouled
                                gains possession at the closest
                                point on the goal line to the
                                infraction. </code></li>

                        aggressive behavior or reckless disregard
                        for the safety of fellow players shall
                        constitute a foul. </code></li>
                    <li><code>F. Player Positioning: After a foul
                        is called, all players shall remain in

                        with the exception of the thrower as set
                        forth in section 404.10(B), is entitled
                        to occupy any position on the field not
                        occupied by any opposing player, provided
                        that he or she does not cause personal
                        contact in taking such a position. </code></li>
                    <li><code>B. Avoiding Contact: It is always
                        the responsibility of all players to
                        avoid contact in any way possible.

                        legitimately-positioned opponents
                        constitutes harmful endangerment, is a
                        foul and must be strictly avoided. </code></li>
                    <li><code>C. Picks: No player may establish a
                        position, or move in such a manner, so as
                        to obstruct the movement of any player on
                        the opposing team. In the event of a
                        pick, the obstructed player shall
                        immediately call &quot;Pick,&quot;
                        loudly. Play shall then be stopped and be
                        resumed only after a check, with the
                        stall count resuming from the point of
                        interruption or to five if the count is
                        over five. </code></li>
                    <li><code>D. Principal of Verticality: All

                        player cannot prevent an opponent from
                        attempting to catch a pass by placing his
                        or her arms above an opponent. If a
                        player so places his or her arms, and
                        contact occurs, a foul may be called. </code></li>
