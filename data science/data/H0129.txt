<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Haldane's Dilemma</FONT></H2>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">In his book "The Biotic Message"<SUP>1</SUP>, Walter
ReMine claims that the evolution from ape to human (actually from the common
ancestor of the ape and human to human) could not have happened in ten
million years because of what Haldane called the cost of substitution in
his classic <B>1957</B> paper "The Cost of Natural Selection"<SUP>2</SUP>.
Haldane claimed that in a fixed population (a population that is neither
growing nor shrinking in the number of its member animals) of mammals,
no more than 1 gene could be fixed per 300 generations due to the cost
of substitution. Haldane assumed that the deaths caused by the newly disadvantageous
gene's lower fitness (possibly due to a change in environment) would be
over and above the "background" death rate - the naturally occurring deaths
due to all reasons other than the lowered fitness of the gene. This is
known as hard selection, and because most of the animal's excess reproductive
capacity was thought to be used up in the replacement of progeny lost due
to background mortality, Haldane allowed a figure of only 10% for the animal
to "pay" the cost of substitution. Thus a single animal could only contribute
0.1 "individuals" to pay the cost of selection. Haldane estimated that
the substitution cost would require the deaths of 30 times the population
size for a single gene fixation from a very rare mutation to homozygous
in say 99% of the population. Since he claimed just 10% excess reproductive
capacity applied to the cost of 30 times the population size, he came up
with 300 generations (30 / 0.1) to fix a single gene. ReMine then applies
these figures to the human / chimpanzee clade by allowing a generous 10
million years since their evolutionary divergence (the fossil record and
mitochondrial comparisons indicate something closer to 5 million years)
and (a not so generous) 20 years per generation to arrive at a figure of
500,000 chimp/human generations since divergence. Dividing 500,000 generations
by 1 gene replacement per 300 generations yields a maximum of 1,667 gene
substitutions since humans and chimps parted ways. Thanks to the DNA hybridization
experiments<SUP>3-5</SUP> of Dr. Charles Silbey and others, we now know
that humans and chimps differ by an amazingly low 1.6% of their genetic
material. But, given that the human genome consists of 3 x 10<SUP>9</SUP>
base pairs, if we assume 1 base pair per mutation (i.e. we assume all mutations
that led to the differentiation of humans from chimps were point mutations)
this requires 3 x 10<SUP>9</SUP> x .016 = 4.8 x 10<SUP>7</SUP> gene substitutions
to occur in a period during which Haldane's theory predicts only 1667 gene
substitutions can occur. Hence, "Haldane's Dilemma".</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Is it all over for evolutionary science? Has ReMine
(an Engineer working totally outside his field!) completely refuted 80
years of population genetics in one fell swoop? I don't think so, and you
won't find a scientist who isn't already committed to creationistic theology
who thinks so either. Let me show you a few things wrong with what ReMine
has to say along with some problems with Haldane's substitution cost.</FONT>
<H3>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">ReMine's Problems</FONT></H3>

<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">ReMine neglects the fact that humans did not evolve
from chimpanzees, rather humans and chimps evolved from a common ancestor.
Therefor we have actually had two different branches each evolving independently,
thus allowing for twice as many gene substitutions (3300 vs. 1700) as ReMine
has allowed, even if all of the above is true.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">ReMine assumes that all the differences between the
human and chimp genomes are due to selection. This can't possibly be the
case because many of the differences are known to occur at the 3rd triplet
of gene codons and thus usually do not change the amino acid coded and
can't affect fitness. Furthermore, since 95% of the genome is not transcribed
(although that does not mean it is all non-functional ), most point mutations
will not affect fitness. This reduces the number of <B>selected</B> substitutions
by 5 x 2/3 % or from 4.8 x 10<SUP>7</SUP> substitutions to 1.6 x 10<SUP>6</SUP>.
Please remember that changes in the genome due to drift and other "random"
processes do not add to the cost of substitution. I should add that Haldane's
Dilemma has been viewed by scientists as possible evidence for the importance
of Neutral Evolution as proposed by Kimura in 1967.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">ReMine neglects the fact that there are only 23 pairs
of human chromosomes. Thus, when there are any favorable genes on the same
chromosome, their substitution cost would only have to be paid one time
for the chromosome as a whole, not one time for each favorable gene. This
alone could falsify ReMine's whole argument if many genes are approaching
fixation on a few chromosomes.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">ReMine ignores the possibility of gene hitchhiking
- the concept that even though some mutations are neutral, they will be
carried to fixation because they are physically close to a gene that is
beneficial.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Finally, ReMine ignores the fact that due to non-point
mutations (deletions and insertions due to non-equal crossing over), a
single mutation can affect many more than one DNA base pair. In fact, what
has to be by far and away the most common mutation is the change in DNA
due to the alignment mismatch mutations in mini-satellites. These mutations
can affect some <B>multiple</B> of between 5 and 15 base pairs and <B>have
been observed in as many as 1 in 6 human sperm!</B>.</FONT></LI>

<H3>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Haldane's Problems</FONT></H3>

<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Haldane assumed that the cost of substitution had
to be paid <B>on top of the "natural" death rate!</B> In other words, it
didn't matter that 90% of a mammal's offspring died without reproducing
- any death that resulted from the substitution of one gene for another
had to be additional death that the animal would not "normally" have suffered.
This is known as <B>hard selection</B> and we can now easily see why Haldane
only allowed an excess fertility of 10% to go towards the cost of substitution.
However, most Biologists today consider all or some selection to occur
as <B>soft selection</B>. In this scenario, the cost of substitution is
"paid" in the natural death rate of the animal. That is, a disproportionate
number of the individuals that die without reproducing in any generation
are the ones that have lower fitness due to their genes. The Biologist
Bruce Wallace has been the champion of soft selection, and you can learn
more about this topic in his book "Fifty Years of Genetic Load - An Odyssey".</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">In "The Cost of Natural Selection", Haldane only
considers the case of a change in the environment that causes a common
allele to become disadvantageous. It's easy to see how such a change could
lead to an increase in the death rate as postulated by Haldane (at least
in a hard selection scenario). Obviously, environments can change so drastically
that the genetic diversity of a species is insufficient to allow that species
to survive under the new conditions. Haldane's calculations seem to be
an entirely appropriate (although simplified) description of a common allele
which has become disadvantageous due to a change in the environment under
hard selection conditions. However, another possibility which is completely
ignored by Haldane in "The Cost of Natural Selection" is the possibility
of a rare allele becoming advantageous. Such an allele could become advantageous
because of a change of behavior in the organism, a change in the environment,
or migration to a different environment. Another possibility is that the
allele could arise through a beneficial mutation of an existing allele.
Whatever the reason for the change of fitness, the consequences of an increase
in the fitness of a rare allele are completely different from the consequences
of a decrease in fitness of a common allele (for hard selection). A common
allele becoming disadvantageous would lead to an increased death rate for
the species, but a rare allele becoming advantageous would lead to an <B>increase</B>
in the species population (in the absence of resource limitations). <B>Theoretically</B>
(in a na&iuml;ve sense), the rare allele could approach fixation without
causing a decrease in the absolute numbers of the previously common allele
by causing a large increase in the species' population due to the (formerly)
rare allele's increased fitness. These two scenarios are not equivalent
in the patterns of deaths of individual organisms. Even though the rare
allele is going to eventually replace the common allele by causing the
deaths of individuals that carry the disadvantageous allele (due to competition);
the number of deaths for individuals with the common disadvantageous allele
will not increase significantly until the number of individuals carrying
the new advantageous allele increases to a level high enough to seriously
compete with large numbers of individuals carrying the old allele. Thus,
we will not see the loss of 10% of the population generation after generation
because an extremely small number of individuals are 10% more fit than
the rest of the population. Only when the number of more fit individuals
increases to a level where competition with the less fit individuals is
significant will there begin to be serious increases in the death rate
of the less fit individuals. It's almost as if the selection coefficients
of the two alleles are frequency dependent - the selection coefficient
of the common allele decreases as the frequency of the advantageous allele
increases. I will be exploring the mathematics of this situation in detail
in a subsequent section of this essay.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Since the paper was written <B>forty years ago</B>
(and I think it's no accident that ReMine chose this paper over the far
more sophisticated equations that are available today), Haldane used the
simplest equation possible to describe the effects of selection. While
this was a great improvement in its day, the whole idea of a "cost" of
substitution disappears (at least as a limit on the evolution rate) with
only a slight improvement to this equation that allows it to model reality
a little more closely. I will show this below.</FONT></LI>


<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The classic view of gene fixation involves assuming
a starting frequency for two alleles of a single gene, applying the Hardy-Weinberg
rule to the frequencies to calculate the frequency of each genotype in
the next generation, and then applying a fitness factor to each genotype
to simulate the effects of selection.</FONT>
<PRE>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">Haldane's Calculations for the Replacement of Gene "a" by Gene "A"

Symbols:

p - frequency of gene A at any given time.

q - frequency of gene a at any given time. Note that p + q always equals 1.

&nbsp;s - the selection coefficient of gene A.

w - the fitness of gene A, w = 1 + s.

N - number of individuals in the population.

F - the average number of offspring that each parent produces in a generation.&nbsp;



Assumptions:</FONT></PRE>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">Gene A is fully dominant over gene a. Gene A is a
beneficial mutation that occurs in exactly one individual at the start
of our calculations. Population will remain constant through time.</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000">Calculations:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let N = 100,000

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F = 4

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is 1 individual with an A gene (genotype is Aa, all other genotypes are aa.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 99,999 aa individuals.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p = 1 / 2N = 1 / 200,000 = 5x10<SUP>-6

</SUP>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; q = 1 - p = 1 - 5x10<SUP>-6</SUP> = 0.999995

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s&nbsp; = 0.01



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; w = 1 + s = 1 + 0.01 = 1.01

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; w * p<SUP>2</SUP> = frequency of AA individuals in the next generation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; w * 2pq = frequency of Aa individuals in the next generation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; q<SUP>2</SUP> = frequency of aa individuals in the next generation.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a simplifying step, it is conventional to adjust the fitnesses such that&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the highest fitness is 1 and the less fit individuals have a fitness less than 1.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefor,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p<SUP>2</SUP> = frequency of AA individuals in the next generation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2pq = frequency of Aa individuals in the next generation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; q<SUP>2</SUP> / w&nbsp; = frequency of aa individuals in the next generation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#000000">The number of interest to Haldane was</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">(q<SUP>2</SUP> / w) * N = (0.999995)<SUP>2</SUP>
/ 1.01 * 100,000 = 99,009 (aprox.).</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">Notice that 991 aa individuals have been lost
due to selection. This is what Haldane called the cost of substitution
for one generation. He continued iterating this process, summing the number
of aa individuals lost each generation until gene A became nearly fixed.
That sum, divided by the population size was what Haldane called the cost
of substitution. But, does this process reflect reality very well? Why
should the addition of one individual having a slightly beneficial gene
cause the death of 991 individuals who otherwise would have gotten along
fine. What is especially telling is that if the population size is raised
to 1 million, now 9901 individuals have to die, even though the fitness
hasn't changed any! This just doesn't make sense.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The problem lies in the normalization of the fitness
constant and the assumption of constant fitness. As Bruce Wallace puts
it, although Haldane killed 991 individuals with his selection coefficient,
most of those individuals were "resurrected" in the next generation with
the assumption of a constant population! What we need is a slightly different
fitness "constant" that allows for the fact that one slightly fit individual
is <B>not</B> going to kill off nearly 1000 less fit individuals. And that
is just what I provide in the next section.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Haldane's Calculations for the Replacement of
Gene "a" by Gene "A" With Frequency Dependent Selection</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">First, let's consider a population of genetically
identical individuals (except for X and Y chromosomes!). Using the symbols
and assumptions above, we know that each individual will produce F offspring
of which only 1 will survive to reproductive adulthood. This maintains
the population at N which was a condition we imposed above. This implies
a fitness of 1/F for each individual. Now let's propose a mutation in an
individual such that the mutant is a small fraction s more fit than the
non-mutant (i.e. s = .01 would imply an increased fitness of 1% for the
new A allele over the old a allele). Just to be thorough, I am going to
consider the possibility of incomplete dominance of our new, beneficial
allele (as Haldane did in "The Cost of Natural Selection"). Let X be the
fitness of an individual homozygous for the beneficial mutation, Y the
fitness of a heterozygote, and Z is the fitness of individuals homozygous
for the old, less fit allele. X, Y, and Z can be related by X = (1 + s)
* Z and Y = (1 + sh) * Z . s is a positive selection coefficient as described
above, and h is a factor between 0.0 and 1.0 that indicates the relative
dominance of the two alleles. Thus h = 1 indicates complete dominance for
the new allele, h = 0.0 indicates complete dominance for the old allele.
Notice that Z is slightly less than X as expected for a less fit individual,
with Y somewhere in between, tending toward X or Z depending on the value
of h. Now we are going to apply a round of reproduction to our population
and solve for Z and ultimately Y and X in terms of p, q, s, h, and F. The
variables p, q, and N have not changed in meaning from above. Variable
s has a somewhat modified meaning as described in this paragraph (but I
think it is still quite analogous to the classic coefficient of selection).
Variables F, h, X, Y, and Z were just introduced.</FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000">Note that if for example F is 4 (a pair of parents
produce 8 offspring in their lifetimes) and N (the parent population size)
is 100,000; we have 400,000 offspring <B>before</B> selection. Let's now

<FONT COLOR="#000000">Note that the subsequent generation's population
has been brought back to exactly N by selection, thus meeting our requirement

<FONT COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X = (1 + s) * Z and Y = (1 + sh) * Z



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 + s)*Z*F*N*p<SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp; + (1 + sh)*Z*F*N*2pq + Z* F*N*q<SUP>2</SUP> = N

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1 + s)*Z*p<SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp; + (1 + sh)*Z*2pq + Z*q<SUP>2</SUP> = 1/F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (divided by F)



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Z*((1 + s) * p<SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp; + (1 + sh)*2pq + *q<SUP>2</SUP>) = 1/F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (factored out Z)



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; multiply out the (1 + s) and (1 + sh) terms:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Z*(p<SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp; + s*p<SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp; + 2pq + sh*2pq +&nbsp; q<SUP>2</SUP>)&nbsp; = 1 / F



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; group terms that are not factors of s or s*h:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Z*([p<SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp; + 2pq + q<SUP>2</SUP>] + s*p<SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp; + sh*2pq) = 1 / F



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; since p<SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp; + 2pq + q<SUP>2</SUP> = (p + q)<SUP>2</SUP> and&nbsp; p + q = 1,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Z*(1 + s*p<SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp; + sh*2pq) = 1 / F



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Z = 1/[F*(1 + s*p<SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp; + sh*2pq)]



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the relations for X, Y, and Z as defined above:



Y = (1 + sh)/[F*(1 + s* p<SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp; + sh*2pq)] and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

X = (1 + s)/[F*(1 + s* p<SUP>2</SUP>&nbsp; + sh*2pq)]



</FONT></PRE>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">We now have fitness equations for the two alleles
in terms of F, s, h, p, and q! Now, let's take time out for a reality check.
How do the fitness terms vary for a new, beneficial mutation just starting
out versus what happens when it reaches fixation (let's just consider h
= 1, i.e. complete dominance for the new allele)? Well, when the new A
allele exists in only a few individuals, q is essentially 1, p is 0, and
X and Z approach (1 + s) / F. This is a small but positive fitness that
will lead to increased numbers of A individuals. Meanwhile, the old aa
individuals have a fitness of very nearly 1/F because q is close to 1 and
p to 0. That means these individuals will hardly feel the competition with
the Aa and AA individuals because they are so rare. Only as the frequency
of the new mutant gene is raised ( and q reduced) do the aa individuals
begin to be seriously outcompeted. As q approaches 0 (and p approaches
1), the fitness of the aa individuals approaches 1 / [F * (1 + s)] while
the AA and Aa individuals' fitness approaches 1/F. When the A gene becomes
fixed, its fitness is 1/F, just like every other fixed gene in the population.
This makes sense because it no longer has anyone to compete with - there
are no longer any non-A individuals.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Now, my question is (to anyone who has made it
this far): What is the substitution cost? How have the patterns of death
and birth differed while gene fixation was going on from when the animals
were simply reproducing without substitution? To me, it looks like the
exact same number of individuals have lived and died in each generation
as would have lived and died if substitution were not occurring. To me,
the cost of substitution appears to be an artifact of an old, simple equation
to determine the survivors from one generation to the next under natural
selection. This was exactly the conclusion Bruce Wallace reached in "Fifty
Years of Genetic Load: An Odyssey"<SUP>6</SUP> and it seems perfectly obvious
to me.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I have found further insight into these questions

+ s* p<SUP>2</SUP> + sh*2pq)]* p<SUP>2</SUP> +</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">[1/F + s/F * (h - p<SUP>2</SUP> - h*2pq) / (1
+ s* p<SUP>2</SUP> + sh*2pq)] * 2pq +</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">[1/F - s/F * (p<SUP>2</SUP> + h*2pq) / (1 + s*
p<SUP>2</SUP> + sh*2pq)] * q<SUP>2</SUP>} =</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">1/F</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">What does it all mean? Well, first of all, notice
that the fitness of each genotype (AA, Aa, and aa) is a sum of 1/F and
a factor of s/F that is dependent upon the selection coefficient, dominance,
and allele frequencies. Notice that if the selection coefficient is zero,
the average fitness will be 1/F, just enough to maintain the species population.
Also note that for all values of p and q such that p + q = 1 (I will be
adding this derivation later), the S/F terms for the three genotypes will
always sum to zero, so the average fitness will always be 1/F.</FONT>

treatise on the cost of natural selection. Here is Haldane's conclusion,
which is correct in both points:</FONT>

will probably need drastic revision. But I am convinced that quantitative
arguments of the kind here put forward should play a part in all future
discussions of evolution."</FONT></I>
