<p align=left>	Join us on the 10th annual Northeast Old Car Race in Millville, NJ.  The rally-race runs through, around, and over four states, one bay, one ocean, a couple of rivers, swamps, hills and a few challenges. Millville is going all out this year with a kick-off Parade from the Country Inn through downtown and finishing at the Riverfront Renaissance Center for the Arts, where the entrants will enjoy a hosted dinner prior to Rally School at the American Legion. Following the parade, Race cars will be on display at the American Legion. <br>
<br>

 	Saturday includes a Pit stop in DE, lunch in MD, an afternoon stop in PA, and finishes with dinner in NJ! This is a navigator’s rally-race!  Quick corners, faster elevation changes and beautiful scenery to distract you!  To get any closer to the Bay on Sunday's route, you would need an outboard!<br>
<br>

	Fine tune for The History Channel Great Race!  Bring any type vehicle and rub elbows with past Grand Champions Dave Teter and Wayne Stanfield, Sportsman Division winners Bill Secrest and Howard Sharp; and Dick McKone. (Dick hasn't won the big one yet, but holds SCCA titles and has won many regionals!)	<br>
<br>

	Arrangements can be made to store your car and then ship it on to Atlanta in time for the Great Race. Our rookie school is the best and our laid back rally is the perfect way to learn how to do it. This is also a Jaguar Club North America Club sanctioned rally (it counts as two)...so bring your Jag and win the National Jag Rally trophy.   Rookie teams are encouraged. Come run with the big dogs!</p>
