</p -->
        <p><i>together</i> combines a mortgage and an unsecured credit facility. 
          This section explains how the mortgage and unsecured credit facility 
          work.</p>
        <p><i>together</i> provides you with the flexibility to repay the way 
          you want. You have the freedom to overpay, either monthly or in lump 
          sums, and redraw the overpayments later if you need to (subject to credit 
          checks).</p>
        <p>Interest is calculated daily, so any loan payments you make reduce your balance from the day they are received and interest is recalculated on the reduced balance with immediate effect.</p>
        <p>Subject to status and our lending criteria, you may apply for a mortgage to 
          a maximum of 95% of the lower of either the value or purchase price 
          of the property. In the case of a remortgage, we will always calculate 
          the maximum loan available using the current valuation of the property.</p>
<p>At the same time that you apply for your mortgage, we are able to agree an 
unsecured credit facility of up to 30% of the lower of either the value or purchase price 
of the property, subject to a maximum of &#163;30,000 and a minimum of &#163;1,000. If you wish, you can choose an amount somewhere in between these figures. </p>
<p>This unsecured credit facility acts like a handy cash reserve as it can be used to 
withdraw funds in stages up to the agreed limit at any time during the life of the loan. 
You only pay interest on the part of the loan that you have actually used. You are not 
obliged to use the full unsecured credit facility agreed at the outset of your loan, but you 
can if you wish.</p>
<p>As you repay this unsecured credit facility you may be able to request further 
drawdowns, or increase your credit limit subject to our prevailing lending criteria.
<p>Payments are calculated so that each release from the unsecured credit facility is 
repaid within the original term agreed at the outset.</p>
<p>Both the secured home loan and unsecured credit facility are charged interest at the 
same attractive low rate and for simplicity you make only one loan payment to us on the 
first day of each month.</p>
        <p><b>EXAMPLE </b></p>

<p>Suppose that you wish to buy a property worth &#163;100,000 and require a 95% 
mortgage. In addition, you would like to set up an unsecured credit facility to make a 
variety of purchases in the future.</p>
<p>Assuming that you meet our lending criteria, the maximum loan amounts available 
would be calculated as follows:</p>

        <p><b><i>together</i></b></p>
<p>As soon as you are in a position to purchase the property (or transfer your existing 
mortgage to us), the solicitor acting for you will ask us to release the amount of the 
mortgage (&#163;95,000 in our example) to allow the property purchase
(or mortgage transfer) to be completed. We'll also set up your unsecured credit reserve at this time. This can be up to a maximum of &#163;30,000 or to take your borrowing up to 125% in total - whichever is the lower. If you have requested an initial unsecured release, this will also be sent to the solicitor acting for you at this time.</p>
<p>Later on, suppose that you need to redecorate and furnish your home. You can 
simply ask us to send a sum of money from your unsecured credit facility direct to your 
bank account. If, for example, you needed &#163;10,000 we would send this through the 
Bank Automated Credit System (BACS) to your nominated bank account. The cleared 
funds will normally be with your bank within only 3 or 4 working days of you having 
asked for them.</p>
<p>You can ask us to release unsecured loan funds whenever you want (subject to 
your unsecured credit facility limit). We ask only that each release of funds is for a 
minimum sum of &#163;500.</p>
<p> In the above example, the monthly loan payments due would initially be calculated 
based upon the mortgage amount (&#163;95,000). Following the release of the unsecured 
loan (&#163;10,000), subsequent payments due would then be recalculated using the new 
total of released funds (&#163;105,000). Each time that further releases are made, the 
payment due would be recalculated. This ensures that you are only asked to make 
payments based upon the amounts that you have actually borrowed.</p>
<a name="flexible"></a>
&nbsp;<br>
<p><b>FLEXIBILITY</b></p>
        <p><b>OVERPAYMENTS</b><br>
With <i>together</i> you can make overpayments on both the secured 
and unsecured loans. These overpayments can be in the form of occasional lump sums or 
regular monthly overpayments or a combination of both. As any overpayments 
immediately reduce the capital balance, this will result in a saving in the amount of 
interest charged.</p>
<p>Overpayments will be automatically apportioned between your secured and 
unsecured loans, unless you stipulate otherwise.</p>


        <p><b>EXAMPLE</b><BR>
Imagine you have a &#163;57,000 capital and interest mortgage with an initial drawdown on your unsecured loan of &#163;15,000 over a 25 year term with an assumed interest rate of 6.99% (<B>7.5% APR</B>). If you paid &#163;50 a month extra you would save &#163;17,866.83 in interest and reduce your mortgage and unsecured loan term by 3 years and 10 months.</p>

<p>Rate used is for illustrative purposes only.</p>

        <p><b>UNDERPAYMENTS</b><br>
You can, at any time, redraw your overpayments by underpaying each month until 
your overpayments are used up. You should telephone us first to notify us of your 
intention to underpay and obtain our agreement.</p>

        <p><b>REDRAW</b><br>
You can at any time redraw your overpayments by either underpaying or stopping 
paying altogether, until the overpaid amount is used up (Subject to credit checks).
<p>If overpayments totalling in excess of &#163;1,000 have been made, you may ask us to 
refund some or all of the overpaid amount by cheque (provided the refund amount is for 
at least &#163;1,000).</p>

        <p><b>PAYMENT HOLIDAYS</b><br>
<i>together</i> offers three types of payment holiday -
<ul>
<li><p>You can redraw your overpayments by simply stopping future monthly 
payments. You should telephone us first to notify us of your intention to do 
this and obtain our agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>Following 9 consecutive full payments you are able to apply for a one month 
payment holiday even if you haven't overpaid.  This means that, subject to our 
approval, you can miss a whole month's payment.  This special facility can be applied 
for in each 12 month period and if you don't use the payment holiday facility in a given 
year, you can accumulate the right to take up to a maximum of 3 payment holidays.</p>
<p>Example: If you choose not to use your one month payment holiday facility within 
the first 2 years you could apply for up to 3 months' payment holidays in the 3rd year.  
Interest will continue to be charged to your loan during the period of a payment 
holiday.</p></li>
<li><p>In certain circumstances (e.g. maternity leave or a career break), you can apply 
for up to a 6 month payment holiday. Simply telephone us for a decision.</p> </li>
</ul>
        <p>Of course, if you take a payment holiday, this will have the effect of increasing 
          the current outstanding balance upon which future loan interest charges 
          are calculated.</p>
