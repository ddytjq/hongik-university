<center><h2>Section 0.1: The Purpose of this Tutorial</h2></center>

<p> Welcome to the online C++ tutorial! The purpose of this
tutorial is to give a good understanding of the programming 
language C++ to any person that wants it. 

<p> So what is C++? Why are so many programs written in C++?

<p>C++ is a third generation programming language. When computers were
first invented, they were programmed with very simple, low-level
commands. A programmer would design a program, then translate the
program into a specific set of codes, known as <a
href="glossary.htm#machine_language">machine language</a>. These codes
would be fed into a computer with switches, punch-cards, or primitive
keypads. These programs were cumbersome to write, and very hard to <a
href="glossary.htm#debug">debug</a>.  (Debugging is the act of
removing mistakes in a program.)  Machine code is considered the first
generation of programming languages.

<p> <a href="glossary.htm#assembly_languages">Assembly languages</a>
are considered the second generation of programming
languages. Assembly languages allow a programmer to design a program
and translate it into machine language using a piece of software
called an assembler. Most assembly languages are still very cumbersome
to work with. However, the biggest disadvantage of assembly languages
is that they are processor-specific. This means that programs written
in assembly language will only work on processors similar to the one
of the machine that they were written on.

<p> Third generation languages are <a
href="glossary.htm#compiled">compiled</a> languages. These languages
are not processor-specific. In theory, a program written in a third
generation language will be able to run on any other machine. This is
not always the case, due to a number of factors.  Third generation
languages are much more abstract than assembly languages. Third
generation languages are translated into assembly language by a
complicated piece of software called a <a
href="glossary.htm#compiler">compiler</a> A compiler can be thought of
a a language translater.

<p> C++ is a very useful language, because it gives the programmer a
lot of control, but also is abstract enough so development can be done
fairly quickly. C++ is a very <a
href="glossary.htm#portable">portable</a> language as well, because it
is a third-generation language, and because it has a well defined set
of standards written for it.

<p> C++ is widely used for program development under a variety of
operating systems. Good C++ programmers are in high demand today.
