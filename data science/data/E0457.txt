<H1>Application Development Tips</H1>

<P>In my twelve years as a software development consultant I've seen beautiful
apps that allow their users to effortlessly quintuple their productivity,
and I've seen unmaintainable trash apps that break every day and cost everyone
time and money. Three factors that make the difference are <A HREF="#simplicity">simplicity</A>,
<A HREF="#normalization">normalization</A> and <A HREF="#documentation">documentation</A>.
Additionally, client-server developers need to watch out for the <A HREF="#backend">back-end/comm
protocol gotcha</A>. </P>

<H2><IMG SRC="images/ltsmlblw.gif" HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=30> <A NAME="simplicity"></A>Keep
Version 1 simple</H2>

<P>On time and under budget? I do it all the time. Not through superior
intellect or hundred hour weeks, but by making the app, especially the
first version, simple. Few moving parts -- just the stuff the user really
needs to do the job. Few unexplored nooks and crannies for bugs to hide.
Minimal pointers to arrays of pointers to functions, or twenty-button customizable
buttonbars. I don't fight my language. Given a choice of a cute user interface
or a robust app, I'll choose the robust app every time. My clients thank
me for it.</P>

<P>I plan for version 2 during initial design of version 1 by inserting
hooks for the more challenging user requests, and features my experience
indicates they'll want later. That way they can be inserted effortlessly
(instead of shoehorned) into version 2.</P>

<H2><IMG SRC="images/ltsmlblw.gif" HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=30> !!! <A NAME="normalization"></A>NORMALIZE
DATA !!! (yes, I'm shouting)</H2>

<P>The truly unmaintainable apps I've seen involved unnormalized data.
Conversely, an app using well normalized data is always maintainable --
worst case you can add or change a functionality by adding a subroutine
or even a small executable accessing the normalized data. Normalized data
does well in integrated, multi-platform environments. Be sure to devote
enough time and attention to the data design. If necessary, hire a consultant.
It's vital to follow the <A HREF="norm.htm">rules of normalization</A>.</P>

<H2><IMG SRC="images/ltsmlblw.gif" HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=30> <A NAME="documentation"></A>Document
it</H2>

<P>We've all seen it. Good applications gone bad. It starts when the original
developer(s) moves on, and an ever changing parade of maintenance programmers
do enhancements. Not knowing the intent of the original developers or understanding
their fundimental design, the maintenance programmers add redundent variables,
data and subroutines. Different sections of the app use different variables,
data and subroutines for the same functionality. A simple change to the
application now requires changes to several redundant subroutines, data
and variables, which must be found by trial and error. Side effect bugs
creep in, with fixes creating more problems. Enhancements that took a day
now take weeks or months to implement.</P>

<P>This is a documentation problem. If the application developers do not
have the time or desire to document their design, hire a consultant to
do it. See <A HREF="../littstip/ltdoc.html">Documentation tips</A>.</P>

<H2><IMG SRC="images/ltsmlblw.gif" HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=30> <A NAME="backend"></A>Allocate
time and people for back-end and comm protocol problems.</H2>

<P>It's natural. In client-server apps, we programmers tend to focus on
data structure and user interface, letting the database server and communications
issues take care of themselves (as advertised). Unfortunately, these issues
usually rear their ugly heads as a large user population starts banging
on the app.</P>

<P>At the start of the design stage, assign or affiliate a network expert
and an expert on the back end platform to the development team. As soon
as the data structure is determined, develop and run test programs to bang
on the data from multiple points, and do bottleneck analysis. The few days
or weeks you spend doing this will save you months. If you don't have the
manpower in house, hire a consultant.
