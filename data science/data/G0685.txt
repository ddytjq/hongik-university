Paczynski (1995) gives the impression that prior to BATSE there was a
firm consensus that gamma-ray bursts came from magnetic neutron stars
in a thick Galactic disk.  While a Galactic disk population was the
most conservative and perhaps the most popular model (Higdon and
Lingenfelter 1990, Harding 1991), extended halo populations have also
had a long and illustrious history (see, e.g., Fishman 1978, Jennings
and White 1980, Jennings 1994, Shklovski and Mitrofanov 1985, Atteia
and Hurley 1986).  What did exist was a consensus that gamma-ray bursts
come from magnetic neutron stars in the Galaxy.  There were many
reasons for this, which I describe below.
<P>
Following the discovery by BATSE that the faint bursts are distributed
isotropically on the sky, Galactic halo and corona models found new
favor (see, e.g., Brainerd 1992, Li and Dermer 1992, Smith and Lamb
1993) as an attractive way of reconciling all of the evidence about
gamma-ray bursts which favors Galactic neutron stars with isotropy.
However, these models were considered somewhat ad hoc, particularly by
advocates of cosmological models.
<P>
Consequently, the debate about whether the bursts are Galactic or
cosmological in origin was characterized as one between those who
advocated objects which we know produce burst-like phenomena (high
velocity neutron stars; see below) but which were not known to have the
necessary spatial distribution (extended Galactic halo) <i>vs.</i> those
who advocated objects which we do not know can produce burst-like
phenomena (e.g., failed supernovae and coalescing neutron star
binaries) but were known to have the necessary spatial distribution
(cosmological).
<P>
The subsequent discovery that many neutron stars have velocities high
enough to escape from the Milky Way and form a Galactic &quot;corona&quot; has
given these models a tremendous boost.  Detailed dynamical calculations
of the motions of high velocity neutron stars moving in the
gravitational potential produced by the bulge, disk, and dark matter
halo of the Galaxy show that a distant corona of high velocity neutron
stars can easily account for the isotropic angular distribution and the
brightness distribution of gamma-ray bursts (Li and Dermer 1992; Li,
Duncan, and Thompson 1994; Podsiadlowski, Rees, and Ruderman 1995;
Bulik and Lamb 1995).
<P>
This is illustrated in Figures 7 and 8, which show the sky distribution
and the brightness distribution for a typical set of parameter values
(e.g., neutron star velocity <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_4789_tex2html_wrap337.gif"> km s<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_4789_tex2html_wrap327.gif">, onset of the
burst-active phase at a neutron star age <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_4789_tex2html_wrap341.gif"> Myr and
lasting <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_4789_tex2html_wrap343.gif"> Myr; the BATSE sampling distance <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_4789_tex2html_wrap345.gif"> kpc).
<P>
In high-velocity neutron star models, the slope of the cumulative peak
flux distribution for the brightest BATSE bursts and the PVO bursts
reflects the space density of the relatively small fraction of burst
sources in the vicinity of the Sun
(d <= 50kpc). Therefore
any spread in neutron star kick velocities, neutron star ages at which
bursting behavior begins, the rate of bursting as a function of age, or
the burst luminosity function tends to produce a peak flux distribution
to -3/2, the value expected for a uniform spatial distribution of
sources which emit bursts that are &quot;standard candles.&quot;  Figure 9 shows
that a spread of less than a factor of 10 in the luminosity function,
which is consistent with everything we know about gamma-ray bursts, is
sufficient to produce agreement with not only the BATSE, but also the
PVO, brightness distribution of bursts (Bulik and Lamb 1995).  Beaming
along the direction of motion of the neutron star can also reproduce
both brightness distributions (Li, Duncan, and Thompson 1994).
<P>
The Galactic corona model predicts subtle anisotropies as a function of
burst brightness, which are a signature of the model and may offer a
means of verifying or rejecting it (Li, Duncan, and Thompson 1994;
Podsiadlowski, Rees, and Ruderman 1995; Bulik and Lamb 1995).  There is
tantalizing evidence that such anisotropies exist (Quashnock and Lamb
1993; Lamb and Quashnock 1994), but these need confirmation using
larger, self-consistent data sets.
<P>
It has often been stated that Andromeda, a bright galaxy similar to our
own Milky Way and lying only <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_4789_tex2html_wrap349.gif"> kpc away, imposes a severe
constraint on extended halo models (Hakkila et al. 1994; Hartmann
1994).  This is true, however, only if one assumes that the burst
sources are distributed like the dark matter in the halo and that the
dark matter halo extends to arbitrarily large distances (Smith and Lamb
1993, Smith 1995).  However, we know that the dark matter halo can
actually extend only 1/3 - 1/2 the distance to Andromeda because of
tidal disruption.
<P>
A similar statement has been thought to be true for corona models
because in such models Andromeda must produce its own &quot;wind&quot; of high
velocity neutron stars.  Some of these will travel toward us, and when
they produce gamma-ray bursts, BATSE should detect them.
<P>
However, Andromeda imposes no constraint if the bursts are beamed along
the direction of motion of the neutron star, as some models posit (Li
and Dermer 1992; Li, Duncan, and Thompson 1994).  Then only the rare
neutron star whose motion is almost directly toward us would be visible
to BATSE.  The few resulting bursts from Andromeda would always be
swamped by bursts from the many high velocity neutron stars born in the
Milky Way and moving away from us.
<P>
Even if the bursts radiate isotropically in all directions, detailed
dynamical calculations of the motion of neutron stars in the combined
gravitational potential of the Milky Way and Andromeda show that an
excess of bursts toward Andromeda is not detected until one samples
distances <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_4789_tex2html_wrap351.gif"> kpc from Earth (see Figure 10)
(Podsiadlowski, Rees, and Ruderman 1995; Bulik, Coppi, and Lamb 1995).
Thus there is ample parameter space (BATSE sampling distances <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_4789_tex2html_wrap353.gif"> kpc) for a population of sources in the
Galactic corona.
<P>
A larger sample of BATSE bursts or a more sensitive instrument might
reveal an excess of bursts toward Andromeda.  If so, this would
constitute definitive evidence that the bursts are Galactic in origin.
However, if no excess were detected it could be due to beaming of the
bursts along the direction of motion of the neutron star and therefore
could not be taken as definitive evidence that the bursts are
cosmological in origin.
<P>
Where do we stand in weighing-up of evidence so far?  Clearly, the
cosmological and Galactic hypotheses are both consistent with the sky
distribution and the brightness distribution of the BATSE bursts.
Quite frankly, the two hypothesis are indistinguishable in this
respect.  Therefore we have to appeal to other evidence.
