Hypothalamus = Homeostasis</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The main function of the hypothalamus is <B>homeostasis</B>,or maintaining the body's status quo.  Factors such as blood pressure,body temperature, fluid and electrolyte balance, and body weightare held to a precise value called the set-point.  Although thisset-point can migrate over time, from day to day it is remarkablyfixed.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">To achieve this task, the hypothalamus must receiveinputs about the state of the body, and must be able to initiatecompensatory changes if anything drifts out of whack.  The <U>inputs</U>include:</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">- <B>nucleus of the solitary tract</B> - this nucleuscollects all of the visceral sensory information from the vagusand relays it to the hypothalamus and other targets.  Informationincludes blood pressure and gut distension.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">- <B>reticular formation</B> - this catchall nucleusin the brainstem receives a variety of inputs from the spinalcord.  Among them is information about skin temperature, whichis relayed to the hypothalamus. </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">- <B>retina</B> - some fibers from the optic nervego directly to a small nucleus within the hypothalamus calledthe <B>suprachiasmatic nucleus</B>.  This nucleus regulates circadianrhythms, and couples the rhythms to the light/dark cycles.  </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">- <B>circumventricular organs</B> - these nucleiare located along the ventricles, and are unique in the brainin that they lack a blood-brain barrier.  This allows them tomonitor substances in the blood that would normally be shieldedfrom neural tissue.  Examples are the <B>OVLT</B>, which is sensitiveto changes in osmolarity, and the <B>area postrema</B>, whichis sensitive to toxins in the blood and can induce vomiting. Both of these project to the hypothalamus.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">- <B>limbic and olfactory systems</B> - structuressuch as the amygdala, the hippocampus, and the olfactory cortexproject to the hypothalamus, and probably help to regulate behaviorssuch as eating and reproduction.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The hypothalamus also has some intrinsic receptors,including <B>thermoreceptors</B> and <B>osmoreceptors</B> to monitortemperature and ionic balance, respectively. <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Once the hypothalamus is aware of a problem, howdoes it fix it?  Essentially, there are <U>two main outputs</U>:</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">- <B>neural signals to the autonomic system</B> -the (lateral) hypothalamus projects to the (lateral) medulla,where the cells that drive the autonomic systems are located. These include the parasympathetic vagal nuclei and a group ofcells that descend to the sympathetic system in the spinal cord. With access to these systems, the hypothalamus can control heartrate, vasoconstriction, digestion, sweating, etc.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">- <B>endocrine signals to/through the pituitary</B>- recall that an endocrine signal is a chemical signal sent viathe bloodstream.  Large hypothalamic cells around the third ventriclesend their axons directly to the <B>posterior pituitary</B>, wherethe axon terminals release <B>oxytocin</B> and <B>vasopressin</B>into the bloodstream.  Smaller cells in the same area send theiraxons only as far as the base of the pituitary, where they empty<B>releasing factors</B> into the capillary system of the <B>anteriorpituitary</B>.  These releasing factors induce the anterior pituitaryto secrete any one of at least six hormones, including <B>ACTH</B>and <B>thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)</B>.  </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Ultimately the hypothalamus can control every endocrinegland in the body, and alter blood pressure (through vasopressinand vasoconstriction), body temperature, metabolism (through TSH),and adrenaline levels (through ACTH).<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="hypo1.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#009999>In the news lately:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino"> The hypothalamus controls body weight and appetite, but it isnot entirely clear how.  Sensory inputs, including taste, smell,and gut distension, all tell the hypothalamus if we are hungry,full, or smelling a steak.  Yet it is mysterious how we are ableto vary our eating habits day to day and yet maintain about thesame weight (sometimes despite all efforts to the contrary!) . The &quot;set-point&quot; theory is an old one in diet science,but until recently the mechanics of maintaining that set pointwere unknown.  It appears that there is an endocrine componentto the appetite system.  Recent studies in mice have shown thatthe fat cells of normal overfed mice will release a protein called<B>leptin</B> (or <B>OB</B>, after the gene name), which reducesappetite and perks up metabolism.  Leptin is presumably actingon the hypothalamus.  Underfed mice, on the other hand, producelittle or no leptin, and they experience an increase in appetiteand a decrease in metabolism.  In both of these mice, the resultis a return to normal weight.  But what would happen if a mouse(or human) had a defective OB gene?  Weight gain would never triggerfat cells to release leptin, the hypothalamus would never slowthe appetite or increase metabolism, and the mouse would slowlybut surely become obese (how the gene got its name).  Sure enough,shortly after these experiments hit the news, the human OB genewas discovered and a few obese patients were found to have themutation.  Many more obese patients had normal OB genes, however,indicating that there is much more to the story yet to be discovered.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>B.  The anatomy of the hypothalamus:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The hypothalamus, as you would expect from the name,is located below the thalamus on either side of the third ventricle. These sections have been cut coronally, and show only one sideof the hypothalamus. <BR></FONT><CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD WIDTH=180><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">In this anterior section through hypothalamus, you can see the large neurons of the paraven-tricular nucleus, which send axons to the posterior pituitary.

The autonomic nervous system:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The autonomic nervous system is an entire littlebrain unto itself; its name comes from &quot;autonomous&quot;,and it runs bodily functions without our awareness or control. It is divided into two systems which, where they act together,often oppose each other: the <B>sympathetic</B> and <B>parasympathetic</B>systems.  The sympathetic system evokes responses characteristicof the &quot;fight-or-flight&quot; response: pupils dilate, musclevasculature dilates, the heart rate increases, and the digestivesystem is put on hold.  The parasympathetic system has many specificfunctions, including slowing the heart, constricting the pupils,stimulating the gut and salivary glands, and other responses thatare not a priority when being &quot;chased by a tiger&quot;. The state of the body at any given time represents a balance betweenthese two systems. <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The best way to learn the functions and structuresof each system is by comparison.

Like all sensory afferents, the actual cell bodies of the neurons sit just outside the CNS in a ganglion (the <B>nodose ganglion</B>).  The central processes of the neurons enter the medulla in the <B>solitary tract</B> and travel a bit before synapsing in the surrounding nucleus of the solitary tract.  The solitary tract is somewhat analogous to Lissauer's tract in the spinal cord. <BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The nucleus receives information about blood pressure, carbon dioxide levels, gut distention, etc.  </FONT></TD><TD WIDTH=252><BR><U><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Sympathetic afferents<BR></FONT></U><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Afferents reenter the dorsal horn of the spinal cord along side of the sensory afferents from the skin.  The sympathetic afferents mainly carry information about visceral pain.  Since this information converges with pain from the body surface, the pain is often perceived as originating at the body surface instead of deep in the viscera.  This phenomenon is called <B>referred pain</B>, and follows predictable patterns.  For example, afferents from the heart enter the spinal cord at the same level as those from the shoulder region.  This is why pain in the heart (a heart attack) is often referred to the shoulder.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>D.  The baroreceptor reflex:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">A reflex is a pathway with an afferent signal (sensory)that evokes an efferent response (motor).  The most common exampleis the stretch reflex, or knee-jerk reflex.  A quick stretch ofthe tendon causes a brief contraction of the muscle.  The autonomicsystem has several similar reflexes.  One of these is the baroreceptorreflex, which maintains a constant blood pressure despite standingup or lying down.  </FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="hypo5.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The afferent signal comes from baroreceptors in thecarotid sinus, a swelling of the carotid artery in the neck. If blood pressure suddenly jumps up, the baroreceptors respondand send the signal back to the nucleus of the solitary tract(NTS).  Neurons in the NTS project to an adjacent vagal nucleus,the nucleus ambiguus, and excite the neurons that project to theheart.  These acetylcholinergic neurons slow the heart, bringingdown the blood pressure a little.  </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">However, there is more to the story.  In the knee-jerkreflex, for the quadriceps muscle to contract briefly, the hamstringmuscle must also relax briefly.  As a flexor-extensor pair, theymust always receive opposite signals.  The sympathetic and parasympatheticsystems are like a flexor-extensor pair, so when activating theparasympathetic you must inhibit the sympathetic.  Just like inthe spinal cord, this is accomplished by an inhibitory interneuron. <BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="hypo6.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">When the high blood pressure signal arrives at theNTS, an inhibitory interneuron projects to the group of cellsthat control the sympathetic neurons in thoracic cord.  Thesecells are called the <B>descending sympathetics</B>.  An importantfeature of the descending sympathetics is that they are constantlyfiring at a steady level.  This enables them to be turned down- if a neuron was already silent, an inhibitory signal would makeno difference.   Therefore, in response to the surge in bloodpressure, the descending sympathetics are inhibited, and the sympatheticsin the spinal cord fire at a much lower rate.  As a result, the heart and theblood vessels are allowed to relax, the heart slows, vasodilationoccurs, and blood pressure drops.  The inhibition of the sympatheticsystem is actually a more powerful way to lower blood pressurethan activating the parasympathetic system.<BR><BR></FONT><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=#0000FF FACE="Palatino"><A HREF="http://thalamus.wustl.edu/course">RETURN TO HOME PAGE</A><BR></FONT></B></BODY></HTML>
