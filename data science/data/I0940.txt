  Go to any game in the UK and one thing is always certain, there will be a
  demand for a match day programme. Following England away is no different but
  has the added complication that many of the Countries we visit either do not
  publish programmes or do so in far too few quantities to fulfill demand
  (anyone remember Germany 2001!!)</font></p>
  <p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Programme dealer David Allen has been following England away since the late
  1980's and has one of the biggest and most comprehensive stocks of programmes
  in the Country. What started as a schoolboy hobby has grown into a full time
  business. England programmes have always been amongst the best-collected
  categories of programmes but recent years have seen their popularity
  escalate.&nbsp; Most collectors try to collect every England programme back to
  the end of World war two - home, away or both. All the homes are fairly much
  attainable and prices start at just £2 upwards. There are however some pricey
  ones to look out for and these are for games played outside of Wembley just
  after the war.&nbsp; In those days, rather like today England home were played
  around League grounds as this was in the times before the infamous
  &quot;Wembley contract &quot; which bound the national team to play every game
  in North London.</font></p>
  <p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <img border="0" src="swiss.jpg" align="left" width="140" height="192" hspace="10" vspace="10">The rarest of them all is from when Holland played at Huddersfield in 1946,
  find this one for under £400 and you have got yourself a bargain!&nbsp; The
  programme is especially rare, mainly because of the post-war paper shortage</font>.&nbsp;
  <font size="3">Some modern day homes are also valuable, this occurs when a
  programme is &quot;sold out&quot; before kick off.&nbsp; A good example of
  this is the EURO '96 opener against Switzerland, when although around 50,000
  programmes were printed which is the norm for a 75,000 crowd the programmes
  were sold out long before kick-off.&nbsp; This was partly due to the boring
  opening ceremony, which prompted many supporters who don't usually buy
  programmes to do so to relieve the boredom. This one usually sells for around
  £50 nowadays.</font></p>
  <p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Those of us that travel to away games know that getting a programme can be as
  unpredictable as the performance of the team. It can be from one extreme to
  the other.&nbsp; I can remember seeing copious amounts of free programmes
  piled around the stadium in Switzerland in 1998 but contrast that situation
  with what happened in Turkey in 1993!&nbsp; The Turks usually produce
  programmes but only make them available to press and VIP's.&nbsp; As we had
  been to the same venue in 1991 when the doorman at the VIP entrance had
  happily handed them out to England <img border="0" src="france.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="140" height="192" align="left"> fans we all gathered there again an hour
  before kick off hoping for a repeat.&nbsp; Unfortunately the Turkish police
  didn't take too kindly to our presence this time and virtually baton charged
  us away to the England end empty handed. Consequently this is probably the
  rarest away programme of the modern era fetching up to £100.</font></p>
  <p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Since the early 1990's Programme Promotions have pre-ordered programmes for
  each away game, where published to ensure a supply for fans back home.&nbsp;
  These have been sold via our mail order catalogue (send for a free copy to PO
  Box 209, Hounslow, Middx TW3 4DF) or on our website <a href="http://www.footballprogrammes.com">www.footballprogrammes.com</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  In some instances we have been the only source of supply anywhere, France away
  in 2000 springs to mind. We ordered our supply, collected the day before and
  went off to the match but couldn't believe that although there was 7,000
  English fans present the French FA had decided to limit sales to fans in the
  main stand only.&nbsp; A similar situation occurred at the Portugal game
  during EURO 2000, programmes were withdrawn from sale at the last minute as
  the wrong photograph of a Belgium dignitary had been published. After a bit of
  persuasion, and threatening to cancel the rest of our sizeable order the
  publishers eventually released our ordered copies!</font></p>

  The Internet revolution has made the ordering of programmes that much easier
  for collectors and supporters who have been unable to buy one or don't want to
  carry a programme at the match. We have recently set up an e-commerce enabled
  web site <a href="http://www.footballprogrammes.com/onlineshop">www.footballprogrammes.com/onlineshop</a></font>.&nbsp;
  <font size="3">This facility allows fans to reserve a copy of each England
  home and away programme prior to the game. There is also a large selection of
  other recent England programmes including the France and Portugal programmes
  mentioned above plus an array of other big match programmes.&nbsp; If visiting
  the site we hope you find something of interest.</font></p>
