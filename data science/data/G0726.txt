Since you've got the basics, now you can have fun with light rays in
spacetime diagrams.  This one describes me standing still and watching
Lupin fly off at some significant fraction of the speed of light and then
coming back.  While I was watching him, I flicked a flashlight on and off
at pre-arranged time intervals.  If you follow Lupin's worldline, you'll
notice something funny.  While I send my light rays off at a certain
interval, in the first half of Lupin's journey he sees those light
rays---but the intervals seem longer to him!  He sees me and thinks I'm
moving too slow! When he flies back towards me, the intervals he sees are
now much smaller than the intervals I flick the flashlight (or they would
be if I could draw straight lines right).  He sees me moving much faster
than normal! This distortion is called time dialation.  It happens
whenever someone moves, but it is more pronounced when they move at
significant fractions of the speed of light.

What do I see of him?  Do I see time dialation for Lupin?<br>

Sure I do!  This diagram is of the same incident, but this time Lupin
flicks a flashlight at pre-arranged time intervals as he flies (pretty
dexterous for a bird!).  While he's flying away from me, I perceive the
intervals of light as larger than normal.  While he's flying towards me, I
see 'em as smaller than normal.  Translation: while he flies away from me
at some fraction of the speed of light, I think he's moving too slow; and
while he flies towards me, I think he's moving too fast.

Great, so we've got spacetime diagrams with moving birds and people and
light rays.  We can draw a spacetime diagram for anything!  Again, not
quite.  You can draw them for Lupin, who was flying with a constant speed.
You can draw them for me, who was standing still.  You can't draw them for
me if I had gotten in a car and accelerated to 35 mph.  Why not?  It has
to do with something called an inertial reference frame.  That's a
reference frame where Newton's laws of motion hold true.  It's <i>not</i>
an accelerated frame.  Accleration is the change of speed and/or the
change of direction.  Aha, you say, in those previous diagrams Lupin
changed direction---gotcha!  That's true.  When Lupin changed direction,
he was not inertial.  The way I drew the diagrams, when he changed
direction, he also experienced infinite acceleration (which would be the
end of my poor bird, realistically).  Eh, well, um...just leave it at
'inertial observers do not accelerate.'
