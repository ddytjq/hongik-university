<p>MASTER'S DIVISION </p>



<p>The master's division witnessed many remarkable events and feats this year in Santa

Maria, CA. To rank them would be futile- try sorting through this short list, then add

your own memories&#133; </p>



<p>Harvey Brandt won his 10th consecutive Discathon title in the Master's division. He

retires undefeated in that event in that division. Who knows if he'll play down a division

in the future, or if he'll lobby the powers that be to implement out-of-control paced

discathon in place of the controlled-pace event now enjoyed by the Grand Masters? </p>



<p><img SRC="kirkquiche.jpg" ALIGN="right" ALT="Freestyle Photo" width="252" height="261">John

Kirkland, 51-year old Dorian Gray (emphasis on the gray) Grand Master, playing down in the

Masters, along with Dan Roddick (a mere 50 years young). Kirky, as he has been officially

dubbed by Jimmy the Geek (as Herrick the prognosticator and odds-maker refers to himself),

played three events only. All he did in those three events was manage 8th in distance

(four meters out of the final), third in SCF (setting GM world records in MTA with the

best throw of the tourney {13.01}, and combined SCF points record {138.56} along the way),

and first in DDC in a tightly contested final with partner Rick LeBeau vs. Jon Freedman

and John Greensage. </p>



<p>The ascent of new blood into the Master's division, led by John Greensage- first in

distance, second in DDC, top ten in everything else, and a mere nine points behind Harvey

in the overall race, taking a clear second in the division. We also witnessed Tony

Pellicane scraping off the competitive rust to show flashes of brilliance in DDC (no

surprise there), SCF, Accuracy, and Discathon (made final in exciting semi-final down to

the wire victory). Also presenting problems for the grayer-beards in the division were Jon

Freedman (finals in Distance and DDC) and Rick Sader (second in Freestyle with Danny

Cameranesi; fourth in distance{!}; seventh in Thon, and 11th overall). </p>



<p>A deeper-than-the-US Open DDC field, in which any of the teams in the six team round

robin semi could have made the final. The eventual winners, Kirkland and LeBeau, had three

two-point wins in pool play, and won a 22-20 squeaker against the sixth place team in the

semis, Kirk (hardest burns in the tournament) Young, and Bill (I can tip anything at any

angle) Wright. Down 20-18 in that game, it's probably a good thing Kirky and Quiche didn't

know a loss would have knocked them out of the final altogether. </p>



<p>The overall performances by such players as Larry Imperiale, who constantly impressed

observers with his learning curve in events outside freestyle. Watching Larry and Bill

Wright play DDC (not as partners) gave one pause for thought as to how good they could be

if they had begun playing a decade ago. In any case, they are far from their prime in DDC,

as they both displayed great skill in executing difficult escapes and attacks during the

DDC rounds. A little more experience in DDC and they both could be scary. </p>



<p>The overall race took shape early in the week with Harvey, Herrick and Greensage

appearing to be the front-runners. Sam Neilson of Great Britain showed some very strong

performances during the week, giving him an outside shot by virtue of his strength in SCF

(first) and Distance (2nd). Dave Hesselberth, the lone representative from the Tar Heel

state, finished one half point ahead of Rick LeBeau for fourth place. Dave showed very

well in the power events as well, finishing one spot behind Sam in both SCF (3rd) and </p>



<p>Distance (2nd). Rounding out the top ten were Tony Pellicane in sixth, Tournament

Director Cliff Towne in 7th, Glen Whitlock (1st place Golf and 4th place Accuracy), Sam

Neilson (9th) and Jeff Kennedy in the 10th spot. </p>



<p>The partner events were particularly compelling, with suspense reigning during the

finals for both Freestyle and DDC. In freestyle, Greg Riley and Mark Blakemore threw down

the gauntlet early in the round with an incredibly entertaining performance that included

a wardrobe change early in the routine- playing the rest of the routine in custom-made

Harlem Globetrotter uniforms performing to Sweet Georgia Brown, then Earth Wind and Fire.

Their nearly flawless routine looked like it would propel them to a second consecutive win

in the event. Then Danny Cameranesi and Rick Sader executed graceful and acrobatic routine

of their own to put their claim on the title. Finally, Randy Silvey, Bill Wright and Larry

Imperiale worked their wizardry, employing two discs simultaneously during much of the

routine. All three routines elicited overwhelming applause from the assembled masses. In

the end, the threesome won the day, with Cameranesi/Sader a close second, followed by

Blakemore &amp; Riley. </p>



<p>DDC pitted four ambidextrous players for the first time in a final. Newcomer John

Kirkland (did you ever think you'd read that description of Kirky?) paired with Rick

LeBeau. They eked into the final with a final game 22-20 win in the semis. John Greensage

and Jon Freedman, two veterans of many finals, lost the first game in the semis to

Kirky/Quiche, then got on a roll to finish 4-1 in the semis and earn the other spot in the

final. In a two of three final format playing to 21 points, the two teams were never

separated by more than three points, and had numerous lead changes in both games.

Kirkland's timing burns were just a little too good, pinning John and Jon with impossible

escape situations on several occasions. Both games ended with successful doubling attacks

by Kirkland and LeBeau, capping an exciting 21-17, 23-21 victory. </p>



<p>SCF deserves mention for one of the strongest aggregate showings ever in the prelims.

With Kirkland and Sam Neilson leading the way, seven players had totals of 230 points or

better. (To achieve 230 points for two rounds, a player must average 11 seconds for MTA

and 55 meters for TRC- for both rounds.) To the astonishment of the participants and

spectators alike (including hopefuls Cliff Towne and Rick LeBeau with 231 and 230 points

respectively) , four of the last five players threw TRCs of over 60 meters to make the

toughest cut ever at 237 points. The finals got off to a slow start in MTA, with each

player appearing overcautious. Then, in the third round, three players threw 11 seconds or

better, with Dave Hesselberth leading the pack at 12.91. Kirky and Neilson were within

striking distance in the mid-11s. TRC turned out to be suspenseful, as no one took control

with a big mark. It was anyone's game down to the final throw, and when Dave Hesselberth

couldn't quite hang on to his winning throw, all everyone could do was wait for the final

tallies. On the strength of his 57 meter TRC in the final, Sam Neilson edged Hesselberth

and Kirkland, who in turn nudged out Jim Herrick and Harvey Brandt, respectively. </p>



<p>In Golf, Glen Whitlock got away from the pack early, and took a four-stroke lead into

the final 18 holes. Mike Cloyes, steadily ate into the lead, catching Glen with a hole to

go, only to give it back on the final hole for a tight one stroke margin of victory for

Glen. Quiche snuck up on the lead foursome to gain a tie for third with Merle Witvoet.

Cliff Towne played steadily all the way through, and but for a gacked 15-foot putt on the

last hole would have tied for third as well. </p>



<p>GRANDMASTER'S DIVISION </p>



<p>The GM division was a reprise of head-to-head battles between longtime friends and

partners Mark Horn and Snapper Pierson. They arranged well ahead of time to play the pairs

events together, ensuring that the overall outcome would rest strictly on their individual

performances. They couldn't have scripted a closer race. </p>



<p>In a small field of just seven overall players in the GM division, it looked like

Snapper and Mark early. Paul Thompson and Bob Verish were garnering all the third and

fourth place finishes as the events progressed, but Snap and Mark were busy setting up a

big showdown on Saturday. The closest events on the playing field were Discathon, where

three players were tied at the end of the first round of controlled pace thon. Snapper

appeared to be unhappy with his Accuracy round early in the week, and that would become a

factor later on. </p>



<p>As each event became history, it was clear that the GM overall race was going to come

down to the wire. Snapper put golf away early, winning by 15 strokes with his usual

masterful performance. Naturally Mark took second. In a DDC field in which only four

players partook, the division decided to play a round robin format among themselves, which

allowed Snapper to win that event as an individual. Snapper also broke the logjam in the

second round of Thon, and won that event, with Paul Thompson squeezing in for second ahead

of Mark. Freestyle was a wash among the top three players, since they all played together.

Specialists Steve Hays and Mike Esterbrook won freestyle, with Joe Messner, Steve Scannell

and Doug Korns placing second. </p>



<p>In reviewing the overall finishes of the players, two big occurrences were Paul's

second in Thon, and Doug Korns' second in Accuracy. That added just enough balance to the

scoring to facilitate the eventual outcome. Saturday morning, Mark reversed the momentum,

winning Distance by a 12-meter margin, then riding the strength of his 12.79 second MTA to

victory in SCF. It should be noted that both Snapper and Mark had excellent rounds of TRC

in each round of SCF. Added to his win in Accuracy, that left the division overall crown

to the winner of the tie breaking procedure. </p>



<p>Well, let's see&#133; Mark and Snapper each won three events outright, so we take a

look at most second place finishes, and we see that they both had two of those&#133; so we

go to third place finishes and we see &#133; that&#133; they both had two of those as

well. That led to a showdown at the Awards ceremony, at which they Rochambeau'd for the

crown. Naturally, it was a tie, with both men throwing scissors. It was noted that the two

men really are closer than meets the eye. They've been in the sport since the Stone Age,

are separated by one day in age, and are both shorter than their sons, who are taller than

5'7&quot;. At the end of the ceremony, they were seen near the buffet table sawing the

plaque in half with a butter knife. </p>



<p>WOMEN'S DIVISION </p>



<p>Nine women showed up to play the overall events, a large field in any Master's

tournament. From early in the week, it looked like it would be a showdown between Kaili

Young, veteran now of four Master's events, and Judy Robbins, who keeps adding to her

freestyle prowess while honing her skills in the other events. </p>



<p>As in the GM division, one of the top two overall finishers earned first place in all

but one event- in Accuracy they tied for second behind Laurie Cloyes. Kaili won Distance,

Golf, Thon, and DDC (playing with G Kirkland, a former overall player now specializing in

DDC). Judy won SCF with convincing performances in each round, and owned Freestyle. With a

final margin of just 3.5 points, Kaili prevailed to win the division overall title over

Judy, followed by Beth Verish in third place. </p>



<p>It was great to see so many families at this event. Several of the progeny could be

seen attempting world age group records during the week. In addition, Chris Horn appeared

to bring three or four clones of himself to the tournament, as he was everywhere helping

out with staffing and running events. </p>



<p>SENIOR GRANDMASTER DIVISION </p>



<p>Sunny &quot;Theo&quot; Cade was &quot;the Man&quot; in this division. Although Bill

Richards came back to nip him in disc golf and Donn Blake of Nevada had come to play,

Sunny's skill and willingness to play all the events garnered him this year's SGM Trophy.

Jimmy the Geek's tip: Look for a different story next year as Bill Richards appears to

have been bit by the overall bug. </p>



<p>LEGENDS </p>



<p>With the eleventh hour addition of Waller Park local, Lloyd Siler, the largest Legends

field ever (5 players) assembled in Santa Maria this year. Steady Ed Headrick's early

departure left Dr. Stancil Johnson to joust for the overall title with the experienced

Der-Hsin Tang of China and the rookie Pat Shea of El Dorado. Cliff Towne used the standard

inducement (&quot;It's Fun!&quot;) to convince Pat Shea to play all the events in his

first overall tournament. Pat's training paid off as he secured second place to Dr.

Johnson. Another tip from Jimmy the Geek: Stancil's victory almost carried a new Legends

distance record with it. Look for that record to fall in Minnesota next year! </p>



<p><strong>TD's AWARDS </strong></p>



<p>Most Fun Wins : Becki Zimmerman </p>



<p>Most Spa Time : Pete Fust </p>

<p>Acknowledgements for a great tournament are due to Cliff Towne, who presided in his

usual gracious fashion over a very well run tournament. Cliff was not only a great go-to

guy for problems that came up during the events, but was also a great Master of Ceremony

at the awards banquet, where the assembly got to witness Larry Imperiale pay off not one

but two sets of 25 push-ups each for bets he had lost with other players on the outcome of

certain events and/or the overall. </p>
