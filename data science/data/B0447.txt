<P class="funds"><span class="funds"><a name="5"></a></span>What is an ISA ? 
<P>The Individual Savings Account (ISA) was launched on 6 April 1999 and are a 
  means by which investors can save and invest without paying income or capital 
  gains taxes on the proceeds. 
<P>ISA's are available to all UK residents aged 18 or over. 
<P>You can keep the following types of investment in an ISA: 
<ul><li>Cash 
  <LI>Stocks and shares - including Fidelity's OEIC's, unit trusts, investment trusts 
  and recognised offshore funds.
<LI>Life Assurance  </ul>
  <P>There are two types of ISA: 
  <ul>
    <LI>Maxi ISA - this is an 'all-in-one' option, if you like. You can keep stocks 
      and shares, cash and insurance (depending on what your chosen companies 
      offer) within a Maxi ISA. You can only have one Maxi ISA in each tax year. 
    <LI>Mini ISA - you can choose to invest in different types of investments 
      shown above through ISAs offered by different companies. In any one tax 
      year, you could choose one company for your Mini Cash ISA, one for your 
      Mini Stocks and Shares ISA, and one for your Mini Insurance ISA. 
  </ul>
  <P><B>You cannot hold both a Mini AND Maxi ISA in a tax year.</B>

  <P>If you invest in a Maxi ISA you cannot subscribe to another Maxi ISA elsewhere 
    or to a Mini ISA in the same tax year. If you are investing in a Mini ISA, 
    you may not subscribe to any other Maxi ISA or to another Mini ISA of the 
    same type in the same tax year. These rules apply irrespective of whether 
    the ISA is still open or if you have since closed your account.

    ? 
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">In launching the ISA the Government particularly want 
    to help people who are not currently saving to get started and people who 
    are saving to save more. Since many ordinary savers are concerned about getting 
    a poor deal and being caught out by complicated small print, the Government 
    have decided to introduce the idea of CAT standards for ISAs.</FONT> 
  <P><FONT FACE="Arial">The CAT standards will concentrate on three features:-</FONT> 
  
<ul>
  <li><FONT FACE="Arial">fair Charges</FONT> <FONT FACE="Arial">easy Access</FONT> 
    <FONT FACE="Arial">decent Terms</FONT> </li>
  <li><FONT FACE="Arial">The introduction of CAT standards will ensure that if 
    an ISA meets the CAT standards the charges will be low, you will have easy 
    access to your money and the terms will be easy to understand and fair.</FONT> 
  </li>
  <li><FONT FACE="Arial">It should be remembered, however, that there is no obligation 
    for every ISA to meet these standards. Indeed an ISA meeting the CAT standards 
    may not necessarily be the best option for you. For example, you might find 
    that a Mini Cash ISA which does not meet the CAT standards because it restricts 
    the number of withdrawals you can make, offers a better rate of return</FONT>.

  <P class="funds"><span class="funds"><a name="8"></a></span>What are Unit Trusts 
    ? 
  <P>Unit trusts are collective pooled investment vehicle where your investment 
    buys units, each of which replicates the holdings of the whole fund. It is 
    collective because it puts together the money from many different investors 
    for a professional investment manager to look after . It is the job of the 
    unit trust fund manager to make sure the money is invested properly and to 
    deliver the investors the very best returns.

    existing PEPs or ISAs ? 
  <P>PEPs and ISAs can be transferred from another provider without losing any 
    tax advantages. You will need to complete a PEP or ISA Transfer Application 
    Form and return this to Fidelity. Fidelity makes no charge for arranging and 
    accepting the transfer, but you may have to pay the standard initial charges. 
    In addition your exit company may charge you a fee. 
  <P>If you wish you can transfer a Fidelity PEP or ISA to another investment 
    company. Contact the company to which you wish to transfer and ask for their 
    transfer application form. Fidelity makes no charge for this. 
  <P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial"><B>PEPs</B></FONT> 
<ul><LI>When transferring PEPs, you need to bear in mind the rules on qualifying and 
  non-qualifying funds. 
<LI>Transfers do not count against the current year's tax allowance 
 </ul> <P><FONT SIZE="3" FACE="Arial"><B>ISAs</B></FONT>
<ul>		
<LI>You can transfer Mini ISA's - Cash, Stocks and Shares - and Maxi ISAs 
<LI>You need to transfer 'like for like' - for example, a stocks and shares element 
  within your ISA will need to be transferred into stocks and shares at your new 
  company. 
<LI>If you are transferring an ISA from a previous tax year, you can transfer 
  either the whole, or just a part, of your ISAs. Also, your ISAs won't be termed 
  Mini and Maxi any more. As you can no longer add more money to previous years' 
  ISAs, there is no need to keep this distinction. 
<LI>If you are transferring an ISA from the current tax year you can only transfer 
  the whole amount. The titles 'Mini' and 'Maxi' will be retained, to ensure you 
  can keep track of the tax-free allowances still available to you. </ul>

  <P class="funds"><span class="funds"><a name="16"></a></span>How will charges 
    and expenses affect my investment ? 
  <P>Some funds available carry no initial charge. For funds that do carry an 
    initial charge, we have discounted the initial charge by 2.50% of your contribution, 
    depending on the fund and distribution channel, and the remainder will be 
    invested. 
  <p> 
  <P><B>Annual charge</B> 
  <p> 
  <P>Fund management companies earn an annual management fee for investing and 
    managing your money. The fee, calculated daily, is based on the value of your 
    holding and is deducted directly from the fund. 
  <p> 
  <P><B>Switching charge</B> 
  <p> 
  <P>Switching charges apply at a rate of 0.25% of the net price of the units 
    and/or OEIC shares. You cannot switch between ISA components. i.e. between 
    cash and stocks &amp; shares. 
  <p> 
  <P><B>Other fees and expenses</B> 
  <p> 
  <P>Shares in OEICs are bought and sold at the same price. The price of a share 
    is calculated by dividing the Net Asset Value which is the value of the Fund's 
    assets minus its expenses. Shares may be bought at a price that is the sum 
    of the Net Asset Value plus a sales charge if applicable. Shares may be sold 
    back to Fidelity at the Net Asset Value. 
  <p> 
  <P>Unusually high levels of buying and selling may increase the Fund's dealing 
    costs and affect the value of its assets. This is known as 'dilution'. In 
    order to protect the interests of the majority of investors, the ACD has the 
    power to charge a 'dilution levy' in certain instances when shares are bought 
    or sold. Details of policy on charging the dilution levy are available on 
    request. 
  <p> 
  <P>Under <B>Unit Trust</B> 'dual' pricing, the bid-offer spread is the difference 
    between the buying and selling price, and includes sales charges, other fees 
    and expenses and portfolio dealing costs for buying and selling securities. 
    Dealing costs typically amount to around 1% of the 'spread' on an equity fund. 
    Unit trust investors pay these costs whenever they buy or sell units. 
  <p> 
  <P>Stamp duty (0.5%), audit, custody, depositary, trustee or similar fees and 
    taxes may be payable by the funds when investing in shares and securities 
    and such taxes and fees are charged against the fund. We make no exit charges 
    on any fund available from FundsNetwork.
