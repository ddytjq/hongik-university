    2, 2001:</B> Gravity hurts: you can feel it hoisting a loaded
    backpack or pushing a bike up a hill. But lack of gravity hurts,
    too: when astronauts return from long-term stints in space, they
    sometimes need to be carried away in stretchers.</P>

    <P>Gravity is not just a force, it's also a signal -- a signal
    that tells the body how to act. For one thing, it tells muscles
    and bones how strong they must be. In zero-G, muscles atrophy
    quickly, because the body perceives it does not need them. The
    muscles used to fight gravity --like those in the calves and
    spine, which maintain posture-- can lose around 20 per cent of
    their mass if you don't use them. Muscle mass can vanish at a
    rate as high as 5% a week.</P>

    <P>For bones, the loss can be even more extreme. Bones in space
    atrophy at a rate of about 1% a month, and models suggest that
    the total loss could reach 40 to 60 per cent.</P>

    </TABLE>Blood feels gravity, too. On Earth, blood pools in the
    feet. When people stand, the blood pressure in their feet can
    be high -- about 200 mmHg (millimeters of mercury). In the brain,
    though, it's only 60 to 80 mmHg. In space, where the familiar
    pull of gravity is missing, the head-to-toe gradient vanishes.
    Blood pressure equalizes and becomes about 100 mmHg throughout
    the body. That's why astronauts can look odd: their faces, filled
    with fluid, puff up, and their legs, which can lose about a liter
    of fluid each, thin out.</P>

    <P>But that shift in blood pressure also sends a signal. Our
    bodies expect a blood pressure gradient. Higher blood pressure
    in the head raises an alarm: The body has too much blood! Within
    two to three days of weightlessness, astronauts can lose as much
    as 22 percent of their blood volume as a result of that errant
    message. This change affects the heart, too. &quot;If you have
    less blood,&quot; explains Dr. Victor Schneider, research medical
    officer for NASA headquarters, &quot;then your heart doesn't
    need to pump as hard. It's going to atrophy.&quot;</P>

    <P>The question is, do such losses matter?</P>

    <P><IMG SRC="../images/gravityhurts/helms.gif" WIDTH="247" HEIGHT="119"
    ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="1" hspace="10" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALT="see caption">Perhaps
    not if you plan to stay in space forever. But eventually astronauts
    return to Earth -- and the human body has to readjust to the
    relentless pull of gravity. Most space adaptations appear to
    be reversible, but the rebuilding process is not necessarily
    an easy one.</P>

    Station (right).</FONT></P>

    <P>&quot;Each of the parameters have their own normal recovery
    time,&quot; says Schneider. Blood volume, for example, is typically
    restored within a few days. &quot;Astronauts get thirsty when
    they come back,&quot; Schneider explains, &quot;because their
    body says, you don't have enough blood in your blood vessels,
    and that causes the messengers to say, drink more. [Also, the
    body doesn't] urinate as much.&quot;</P>

    <P>Muscle, too, can be recouped. Most comes back &quot;within
    a month or so, &quot;although it might take longer to recover
    completely. &quot;We normally say that it takes a day [of recovery
    on Earth] for each day that somebody's in space,&quot; says Schneider.</P>

    <P>Bone recovery, though, has proven problematic. For a three
    to six month space flight, says Schneider, it might require two
    to three years to regain lost bone -- if it's going to come back,
    and some studies have suggested that it doesn't. &quot;You really
    have to exercise a lot,&#148; says Schneider. &quot;You really
    have to work at it.&quot;</P>

    HEIGHT="177" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="1" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="see caption"></A>According
    to Dr. Alan Hargens, recently of NASA Ames and now a professor
    of orthopedics at the University of California San Diego medical
    school, it is important to keep astronauts in good physical condition.
    &quot;You want the crew members to function normally when they
    come back to Earth ... and not have to lie around for long periods
    of rehabilitation,&quot; he says.</P>

    <P>And Earth isn't the only planet that astronauts might visit.
    One day humans will journey to Mars -- a six-month trip in zero-G
    before they disembark on a planet with 38% of Earth's gravity.
     &quot;[We'll have to maintain] those astronauts at a fairly
    high level of fitness,&quot; explains Hargens. &quot;When they
    get to Mars, there won't be anyone to help them if they get into
    trouble.&quot; They will need to be able to handle everything
    themselves.</P>

    <P>Exercise is the key. But exercising in space differs from
    exercising on Earth. Here, gravity's pull automatically provides
    a resistive force that maintains muscles and bones. &quot;[In
    space] even if you do the same amount of work that you were doing
    down here on Earth, you miss that gravity component,&quot; says
    Schneider.</P>

    HEIGHT="199" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="1" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="see caption"></A>Various
    devices have been developed to mimic the help that gravity provides.
    One Russian experiment provides resistance by strapping jogging
    cosmonauts to a treadmill with bungee cords. But that particular
    combination has not yet proven effective in preventing bone loss
    -- perhaps because it cannot provide sufficient loads. &quot;The
    straps are so uncomfortable that the cosmonauts can only exercise
    at 60 to 70 per cent of their body weight,&#148; says Hargens.</P>

    <P>There's also IRED, a NASA-developed Interim Resistive Exercise
    Device. IRED consists of canisters that can provide more than
    300 pounds of resistance for a variety of exercises. IRED's effectiveness
    is still being monitored, says Schneider.</P>

    <P>Yet another promising device attempts to mimic gravity even
    more closely. Hargens and his colleagues are developing a Lower
    Body Negative Pressure (LBNP) device, a chamber that contains
    a treadmill, and that relies, says Hargens, on the suction of
    an ordinary vacuum cleaner. &quot;We've found,&quot; he says
    &quot;that we can provide body weight by applying negative pressure
    over the lower body.&quot;</P>

    <P>The device, explains Hargens, prevents much of the loss of
    cardiovascular function and of muscle. It also seems to be effective
    in reducing some indices of bone loss. One reason is that the
    LBNP allows astronauts to exercise with an effective body weight
    between 100% and 120% of what they would feel on Earth. Another
    is that -- unlike any previous exercise device -- it restores
    the blood pressure gradient, increasing blood pressure to the
    legs.</P>

    </FONT></P>

    <P>There's growing evidence, Hargens says, that the body's systems
    interact with each other. For example, &quot;you can't just put
    high loads on the bone and then expect it to recover if you're
    not taking care of the blood flow to that bone as well.&quot;</P>

    <P>Scientists aren't yet sure how gravity &quot;signals&quot;
    the body to keep bones and muscles strong. &quot;We know that,
    somehow, gravity is converted from a mechanical signal to a chemical
    signal -- and we know a lot about these chemical signals,&quot;
    says Schneider. The mechanical signals, though, remain a mystery.</P>

    ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="1" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="see caption"></A>Solving
    these problems, says Schneider, could lead to better therapies
    for people who aren't using gravity properly here on Earth. Aging
    is the perfect example. Zero-G living mimics closely the effects
    of old age. Like astronauts, the elderly fight gravity less.
    They're more sedentary, which triggers the loop of muscle atrophy,
    bone atrophy, and lower blood volume.</P>

    <P>If researchers can identify the signals that generate strong
    muscles and bones, it might be possible &quot;to get new pills
    and do exercises&quot; that would trigger those signals here
    on Earth.</P>

    <P>&quot;We've just begun to do research ... looking at the changes
    that can happen to humans,&quot; says Schneider. &quot;There
    are so many wonderful questions.&quot;</P>

    <P>And the answers? They're waiting for us ... up there in space,
    where the absence of weight reminds us that gravitation isn't
    all bad. Sometimes it's a struggle, our daily contest with gravity,
    but now we know the struggle is good!</P>
