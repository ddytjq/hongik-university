			<p class="contenttextbold">Who is eligible?</p>
            <p>You will be eligible for cover if, at the start of the insurance:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>you are resident in the UK<br>
              <li> the total amounts owed are not more than &pound;50,000<br>
              <li>you are aged 18 or over and under 65 when your loan is due to be repaid<br>
              <li>you are at work, other than temporary work, of at least 16 hours a week (not absent due to sickness or injury), 
                and 
              <li>you are the nominated insured person for insurance on your loan application form. 
            </ul>
            <p class="contenttextbold">What if I am self-employed or working on a fixed term contract?</p>
            <p>You may still be eligible for cover and you should take special notice of the additional exclusions which apply 
              specifically to you.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="contenttextbold">Summary of Cover</p>
            <p>Personal Loan Payment Protection Plan can take care of your payments if you're unable to work due to accident 
              and sickness or involuntary unemployment.</p>
            <p>It comes with a &quot;Back to Work&quot; service which provides free independent and confidential advice in 
              coping with an accident, sickness or unemployment, and can help you with finding a new job.</p>
            <p class="contenttextbold">How much does it cost?</p>
            <p>Premiums are calculated according to the amount of money that you borrow and the duration of the loan, specific 
              costs can be found using the Personal Loan Illustrator. Premiums are added to your loan and included in your 
              monthly loan repayments.</p>
            <p class="contenttextbold">How does it work?</p>
            <p>Cover commences when your signed loan agreement has been received by your Bank branch. If you are unable to 
              work due to either accident or sickness or unemployment, then you may be able to claim to have your repayments 
              made for you as follows, subject to a maximum monthly benefit of &pound;1,500 and maximum life benefit of &pound;50,000 
              for all insured agreements:</p>
            <p class="contenttextbold">ACCIDENT AND SICKNESS COVER</p>
            <p>If you are off work because of an accident or sickness for more than 30 consecutive days, then a monthly benefit 
              equal to your loan repayment will be paid, and will continue to be paid after each further complete calendar 
              month of disability until:<br>
            <ul>
              <li> your period of accident or sickness ends, or
              <li> your outstanding loan balance is paid off,
            </ul>
              <p>whichever happens first. </p>
            <p class="contenttextbold">UNEMPLOYMENT COVER</p>
            <p>If you have been made unemployed (or have been declared involuntarily insolvent in the case of a self-employed 
              customer), and you are out of work for more than 30 consecutive days, then a monthly benefit equal to your loan 
              repayment will be paid, and will continue to be paid after each further complete calendar month of unemployment 
              until:<br>
              <ul>
              <li> your period of unemployment ends,<br>
              <li> your outstanding loan balance is paid off, or<br>
              <li> you have been paid 18 full monthly benefits for any one continuous period of unemployment,<br>
              </ul>
              <p>whichever happens first.</p>
              <p class="contenttextbold">LIFE COVER</p>
            <p>If you die, your outstanding loan balance will be paid, less any arrears or any associated interest and costs.</p>
              <p class="contenttextbold">How do I claim?</p>
            <p>You simply phone the free phone number on the certificate and your details are registered on a claim form. 
              This will be sent to you for checking and completion by you, your employer, your doctor or Employment Service 
              or Benefits Agency as appropriate. You will be required to sign the claim form and return it to the insurer. 
              Approved claim payments are made directly to your loan account.</p>
              <p class="contenttextbold">Back to Work</p>
            <p>Personal Loan Payment Protection Plan comes with a dedicated helpline giving free, confidential advice on coping 
              with unemployment and finding a new job. Additionally where practical, medical help is available to help speed 
              your recovery if you are off work due to accident or sickness.</p>
              <p class="contenttextbold">What is not covered?</p>
            <p>Benefits will not be paid for the following:</p>
              <ol>
              <li> Any claim caused by war or similar risks.<br>
              <li> Accident or Sickness or Unemployment due to:<br>
                   <ul>

                   </ul>
              <li> Unemployment:<br>
                   <ul>
                   <li> which is normal, seasonal or regular in your job<br>
                   <li> after temporary work<br>
                   <li> which you knew about at the start of cover<br>
                   <li> which is voluntary or due to your misconduct<br>
                   <li> after a fixed term contract, unless you have been insured for more than 120 days and you have worked for the same employer for more than 12 months and your contract has been renewed at least once, or you were previously a permanent employee<br>
                   <li> if you are self-employed, unless you are involuntarily insolvent<br>
                   <li> for any period you are paid in lieu of notice.
                   </ul>
              </ol>
                <p class="contenttextbold">When does Payment Protection Plan end?</p>
            <p>The insurance will end if any of the following happen:</p>
              <ul>
              <li> the loan repayments end or the agreed date for the end of the loan is reached<br>
              <li> the right to the loan repayment is transferred to a third party<br>
              <li> you reach age 65 or you die<br>
              <li> for unemployment insurance, you retire from work<br>
              <li> you make a fraudulent claim, in which case you will have to return any benefits paid.
              </ul>
              <p class="contenttextbold">What else should I know?</p>
            <p>This is only a summary of cover provided. You will receive a Certificate of Insurance with your loan papers 
              which give full details of the terms and conditions. A copy is available on request. If you are not entirely 
              satisfied with the insurance, simply return the Certificate of Insurance back to your Yorkshire Bank branch 
              within 30 days of receipt. The insurance will be cancelled and, providing you have not made a claim, a full 
              refund will be made of any premiums paid.</p>
