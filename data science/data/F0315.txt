size="2">niverse is a brand new site. It&#146;s main aim is to provide Visual Basic
resources free of charge. The best thing about this site is that everything about it, even
the appearance, only stays if you like it. I want you to keep coming back to this site, no
matter how much I have to work at it. This is why I ask you to send me a comment about
this site. As this site grows the more resources I will be able to make available and the
more time I will spend collecting these resources. Before I created this site I often
spent hours searching through VB and developer sites to find specific source code, sample
projects, sample applications etc. The thing I noticed was how hard it was to find what
you wanted and often when you thought you found&nbsp; what you wanted there was a broken
link or the file had been deleted. When I started making this site I decided to make it
different from the rest, better in every way. I believe I am well on the way to achieving
that but I will need your help to accomplish those goals. Please help this site by sending
your comments, joining in the chat and message boards and by clicking on at least one of
my sponsors. Please visit the Comments section and send me your opinion of this site.</font><font
