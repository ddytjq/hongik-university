          <h3><font size="1" color="#FF9900">Introduction</font></h3>
          <p><font size="1">There isn't a basketball player alive that doesn't
          dream of having a quicker first step.&nbsp; Hall of Fame Coach John
          Wooden once said (paraphrased) give me five quick players versus five
          tall one's and we will beat you every time.&nbsp; However a quick
          first step isn't enough to turn you into a player.&nbsp; Michael
          Jordan, arguably one of, it not the greatest player of all time, could
          beat people consistently off the dribbler due to a combination of
          speed, power and agility.&nbsp; My observations of Michael Jordan as a player drew me to the
          one conclusion.&nbsp; That he was blessed with an ability most players
          don't have, the ability to recover his center of gravity (COG) once it was
          violently &quot;hurled&quot; out of balance in beating defenders to
          the basket.&nbsp;Gary
          Payton is also another example of a player with great agility and
          balance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many quick players can get by their defender, but few have the ability
          to adequately recover their balance and successfully execute the
          critical basketball skill: whether shot, pass, or changing directions
          off the dribble.&nbsp; Balance is also required after explosive
          defensive footwork in order to stop an explosive penetrator attacking
          the basket.&nbsp; Today's Playground Pointer is directed at
          teaching you some simply ideas about developing first step quickness, balance and
          agility which together can take your game to another level.</font></p>
          <h3><font size="1" color="#FF9900">Who's Frappier?</font></h3>
          <p><font size="1">In the early 1980's an Exercise Physiologist from
          Kansas State University named John Frappier came back to the U.S. from
          Europe having studied speed and agility training programs of the
          former Soviet Union.&nbsp; He became convinced that there were
          external ways which athletes could train which would stimulate the
          body's muscles, neurophysiological, and skeletal systems to perform
          more quickly, powerfully, and with extended intensity.&nbsp; This
          acceleration program and their drills have become known in athletic
          development and training
          circles as &quot;Frappier Drills&quot;.&nbsp; I will introduce you to
          a few today, but you probably don't realize that you have almost
          certainly done some of these already in your young basketball
          career.&nbsp; The most obvious one is what is coaches call
          &quot;double line slides&quot; where you execute a defensive slide
          across 3 parallel lines about 1 yard (or meter) apart as rapidly as
          you can in a given set of time.&nbsp; You count the number of times
          both feet cross a line as 1, for a measured period of time, say 30
          seconds or 1 minute.&nbsp; The more strength, acceleration, and
          balance you have the higher you score on this drill.&nbsp; In a very
          oversimplified way this is how most of the Frappier Drills work.&nbsp;
          These drills are designed to teach a player how to move their feet out
          from under their center of gravity, recover, and continue to move
          their feet while keeping their dynamic balance.</font></p>
          <p><font size="1">Frappier believes that by combining Sprint Training,
          Resistance Cord Training, Strength Training, Plyometrics, and what
          they call the Super Treadmill (capable of tilting upward to 40 degrees
          and a maximum speed of 28 mph) that a player can gain a competitive
          edge in acceleration over other athletes.&nbsp; The breadth of his
          program's goes well beyond the scope of today's Playground Pointer.&nbsp;
          What I simply want to do is make you aware that foot quickness,
          acceleration and the recovery of your body's center of gravity after
          dynamic motion are all interrelated and to ignore them in your
          training unnecessarily puts a cap on your basketball playing
          ability.&nbsp; Frappier's program is not recommended for kids under
          the age of 9-10, and for all athlete's starting sprint training,
          resistance cord training, strength and Plyometrics program, proper supervision by trained
          and accredited personal is a must.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
          <h3><font color="#FF9900" size="1">Hopscotch</font></h3>
          <p><font size="1">In their simplest form the games of &quot;hopscotch&quot; or playing the old &quot;four
          square&quot; ball game which you may have played as a young child are Frappier Drills.&nbsp; You don't need an
          expensive program to develop your own Frappier type drills and have
          fun doing them.&nbsp; To get the most out of our ability however consult trained acceleration and sports training and health or medical
          professionals before implementing a complete Frappier acceleration
          program for the best and safest results.&nbsp;
          Results of these acceleration programs have been argued to increase your foot
          quickness 2 tenths of a second in a 40 yard dash, increase your
          vertical jump 4 inches, increase of 50-70% of multi-directional
          agility, and improve recovery time from this exertion 50%.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          For more information you can visit their web site at <a href="http://www.accelerationproducts.com">www.accelerationproducts.com</a>
          where there are a number of references and contact for such
          programs.&nbsp; Many professional players already have personal
          trainers who work with them on these types of drills, and several
          Division I College programs are beginning to add Frappier type
          training equipment to their strength training facilities.</font></p>
          <h3><font size="1" color="#FF9900">Caution in Overloading Workouts</font></h3>
          <p><font size="1">Now that you have a cursory background on Frappier's
          ideas, let me show you a few simple drills you could do on your own to
          improve your foot speed, and agility.&nbsp; These are commonly and
          simply called &quot;ground basics&quot;.&nbsp; One thing to
          remember when working on your athleticism is that over-training when &quot;strength loading&quot; the body can be physically detrimental to your body and eliminate
          any positive gain by properly spacing out your training and recovery
          time from intensive loading.&nbsp; Carelessly overloading also makes
          you much more prone to injuries.&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep such training sessions down to
          2 times per week for less than an hour for all the drills.&nbsp; More
          importantly, give yourself 2-3 minutes active (walking, jogging, or
          moving about) recovery time in between each
          set of drills to allow your body proper time to recover.&nbsp; You may
          not feel it at the time, but later on you will if you don't respect
          this strong recommendation.&nbsp; In Frappier's own highly developed
          and specialized program there are basically four footwork drills (the
          4-square pattern, eight-square pattern, the Krumrie and Munoz patterns
          they use.&nbsp; However you can get quite creative and develop your
          own.&nbsp; Frappier's settled on these drills because over time they
          seemed to produce the best results.&nbsp; However training is sport
          specific so any time you build your own footwork quickness drill, keep
          in mind the type of movement you make in basketball.</font></p>
          <h3><font size="1" color="#FF9900">10 Drills to Compliment Your
          Basketball Workouts</font></h3>
          <p><font size="1">Here are 10 different drills I have used over the
          years to give you an idea of what you can do on your own or with
          teammates.&nbsp; Remember use a fixed time each day (30 seconds is
          good) and restrict each drill to three sets with 2-3 minute break in
          between (teammates can take turns during the break), and as much as 5
          minute rest between different drills (shoot free throws).&nbsp;
          Remember to keep the duration of your total workout down to between
          30-45 minutes twice per week.&nbsp; Record your performance on each
          drill on paper both as a motivator and to help you chart your
          development and progress.&nbsp; These drills are not substitutes
          for basketball skill workouts but should be worked on as compliments
          to developing your quickness and athleticism.&nbsp; The more advanced
          Frappier Drills use elastic cords to restrain and provide resistance,
          again however only use these types of devices in the hands of trained
          and certified specialists.&nbsp; However you can benefit from these types of drills
          even with minimal external resistance.&nbsp; The smoothing of the
          neuromuscular pathways and balance and conditioning you develop by
          doing them will improve your foot quickness.</font></p>
          <p><font size="1">Looking at these footwork drills you will get some
          good ideas how to build your agility and quickness but remember you
          can be creative too.&nbsp; Use some simple non-slip tape to mark the lines on your
          court indoors, or chalk to mark it outdoors.&nbsp; Change the shape
          and distance between the lines for variety and to improve your
          steps.&nbsp; The smaller box and X drills diagrammed here should be
          lines about 3-4 feet long.&nbsp; For the larger movement drills such
          as Big S Carioca and Big X Carioca each leg represents about 3-4
          feet.&nbsp; However making your big box drills more than 15-20'
          doesn't make sense because you seldom must react and change directions
          to accelerate in greater space on the basketball court.</font></p>
          <h3><font color="#FF9900" size="1">Partner Up</font></h3>
          <p><font size="1">Now get those feet moving.&nbsp; Partner up with a
          friend, have them time you and count the touches.&nbsp; You can vary
          the pattern and methods of foot touches in almost every drill and I
          will give you some examples as well.&nbsp; What is the key execution
          point in all of these drills is to keep your head over your center of
          gravity and move your feet.&nbsp; Balance, and quickness must be done
          together.&nbsp; When starting perfect execution of balance and clean
          and proper footwork are more important than speed.&nbsp; As you get
          better then work to increase your speed of footwork.&nbsp; Never
          sacrifice balance, or not cleanly touching the numbers outside of the
          lines for speed.</font></p>

                Most of the drills we have shown involve horizontal
                movement.&nbsp; However you can also incorporate a number of
                footwork drills that take the player from horizontally required
                movements to sprints- to vertical jumps, and back.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                Start on the S back to the basket.&nbsp; On go, turn 180, sprint
                and jump to touch the T with both hands, upon landing, turn 180,

          <p><font size="1" color="#000000">There are literally hundreds of drills like this you
          can use to develop foot speed, agility and balance.&nbsp; Keep in mind
          that you can add a basketball to the drills, having a coach or partner
          pass you the ball as you are moving, or working on your dribbling in
          combination as well.&nbsp; While I haven't gone into great detail here
          today, I
          also have had success working with similar drills that are not just
          horizontal but work from horizontal to vertical, like the
          Turn-Sprint-Tap drill shown last in our 10 drill sequence.</font></p>
          <p><font size="1">The point is you can't expect to have quick feet,
          balance, and agility if you don't make it a part of your training
          regiment.&nbsp; It can be fun, it can be challenging, and it will help
          get you in shape as well.&nbsp;Remember having a partner to observe
          you and give you feedback regarding your body's position and center of
          gravity while doing these drills is essential to your
          improvement.&nbsp; To practice not controlling your center of gravity
          and head will negate all your hard footwork.&nbsp; Keep that head
          quiet, control your waist, and make your feet do the work.&nbsp; If you want to accelerate your
          footwork, and put the quick in your first step, get to work.<br>
