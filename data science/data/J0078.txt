          <font color="#000066"><i>Courtenay BC, June 22, 2002</i></font> - The 
          <b>WILROC Sprint Car & Super Modified Race Series</b> visited Saratoga 
          Speedway for the second time in 2002. They shared the program with a 
          fine field of local Bomber Cars. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><img src="Driver%20Photos/j_montgomery.jpg" width="194" height="156" align="left" vspace="6" hspace="6">After 
          a couple of hot lap sessions, the WILROC cars lined up for qualifying. 
          <b>Jeff "The Hurricane" Montgomery</b> bested the field with a new track 
          record of 13:45, which eclipsed his previous record of 13:66. The sprinter 
          of Victoria's <b>Dirk Zeinstra</b> was unfortunately sidelined with 
          a broken crank during his qualifying attempt. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The "B" dash saw 
          Victoria's <b>Randy Vincent</b> win over Sidney's <b>Rob Scott</b>. 
          "A" Dash honours went to 2001 WILROC Points Champion <b>Darren Yates</b> 
          from Duncan, B.C. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The first heat saw 
          current WILROC points leader Rob Scott push the <b>Ron Douglas</b> Tipke 
          roadster into the premier position and hold off repeated challenges 
          from Yates to earn the victory. The second heat was taken by Randy Vincent 
          over a fast charging Jeff Montgomery. A last lap tangle involved the 
          fifth, sixth and seventh running cars. Fortunately, none were too damaged 
          and were able to make repairs in time for the Main Event. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 25 lap Main 
          Event was for the <b>Jim Haslam Memorial / Victoria Auto Racing Hall 
          of Fame Trophy</b>. At the green flag, Nanaimo's <b>Ron Lambert</b> 
          jumped into an early lead in his beautiful Gambler sprinter. Ron had 
          been fighting electrical problems throughout the evening, but seemed 
          to have found the solution. Rob Scott gave chase, followed closely by 
          <b>Mark Fisher</b> and Darren Yates. Darren overtook Mark on lap 6 and 
          Jeff Montgomery began his charge, moving into fifth. By lap 13 he had 
          moved into 2nd and finally slipped into first on lap 16, never to be 
          headed until he received the checkered. Ron Lambert held on to second, 
          although there was a very spirited four car battle right behind him 
          for third. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">As well as receiving 
          the "A" Main trophy, Jeff was awarded the Hall of Fame Trophy Clock 
          and the perpetual Haslam Memorial Trophy. Presentations were made by 
          Hall of Fame Committee members and 82 year old Inductee <b>Walter Wakelyn</b> 
          from Victoria. </font></p>

          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><i><font color="#000066"><img src="Driver%20Photos/lpg_sooke_mirror.jpg" width="250" height="259" align="right">Sooke 
          BC, June 25, 2002</font></i> - The smile on her face as <b>Lois Pollard-Grant</b> 
          peeled off her helmet and climbed out of her 1969 Chevrolet Nova race 
          car spoke louder than words last Thursday at a Western Speedway practice 
          session.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> “Lois is back in 
          a race car - and loving it,” the grin on the Sooke woman’s face seemed 
          to say. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The birth of her 
          second son, <b>Garret</b>, a brother to eight-year-old <b>Laura-Ashleigh</b>, 
          and a home building project kept Pollard-Grant out of racing full time 
          for about two years. Though she raced a few mini stock events last year, 
          pitted for stock car driver <b>Ron Eberle</b> and wrote for a variety 
          of publications, Saturday night will be her first time back in her own 
          stock car since 2000. She will be running with the Glen Lake Inn Stock 
          Car Series, which is on the slate along with CASCAR’s 31st annual Canada 
          200.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> And Pollard-Grant 
          can’t wait to get back on the track competitively.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> “It’s my life,” 
          she said. “I grew up with it. It was a dinner topic at our supper table 
          every night. We went to the race track every Saturday night. Now it’s 
          30 years later and I’m still doing it.” </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Pollard-Grant is 
          the daughter of <b>Laura</b> and the late <b>Earl Pollard</b>. Her father 
          raced for decades and was inducted into the Victoria Auto Racing Hall 
          of Fame in 1995. He drove in a variety of classes and was still racing 
          and winning in his 70s. He passed away in 1997, but Pollard-Grant always 
          remembers the racing advice he gave her - find your own way around the 
          track.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> “I know he’s with 
          me in the car every lap I do,” she said. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Her brother <b>Larry</b> 
          is a former NASCAR racer who married the daughter of former Winston 
          Cup star <b>Harry Gant</b>. He now lives in North Carolina and builds 
          parts for race cars. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">After years of watching 
          the races, Pollard-Grant decided to climb in herself in 1987 at the 
          age of 21. She finished second in her first and only race that year. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">She has continued 
          on having a mostly successful - and history making - career behind the 
          wheel. Lois and Earl were the first father and daughter race team at 
          Western Speedway when they campaigned mini stocks in 1988. She also 
          was the first woman in Western Speedway’s then 36 year history to win 
          a main event, which she did as a claimers driver in 1989. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Over the years, 
          Pollard-Grant has driven in a variety of classes, sometimes during the 
          same season. In 1988, she was the rookie of the year in the mini stock 
          class and a year later placed second in the class’ points battle. She 
          would repeat the honour in 1998 in the same class. In 1992, Pollard-Grant 
          finished third in the Thundercar points race. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Over the years she 
          has met a number of people through racing - including her husband <b>George</b>. 
          The pair used to pit beside each other. George now serves as his wife’s 
          chief mechanic and crew chief. Her mother, Laura, has the important 
          job of keeping track of all the team’s racing data, while <b>Bob Carlson</b>, 
          <b>Harold Corbett</b> and <b>Tony Burrows</b> all help out in the pits. 
          Also locally the <b>Sooke Chevron</b> station helps out Pollard-Grant. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">While Pollard-Grant 
          is happy to behind the wheel again, she won’t be satisfied just to be 
          racing again.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> “My goal is to 
          be a front-runner,” she said. “I want to be a contender. I have been 
          in the past and I want to do it again.” </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">She’s definitely 
          back. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b> <a name="beaulieu3"></a>Beaulieu 
          Continues Quest for Third Canadian Championship</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
          <font color="#000066"><i>Courtenay BC, June 15, 2002</i></font> - Oyster 
          River's <b>Jason Beaulieu's</b> quest for a third straight Canadian 
          IMCA Championship continued Saturday night at Saratoga Speedway, but 
          unless the car count increases he may be forced to race off the Island 
          to be sure he gets a full 12 sactioned IMCA races.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> Under IMCA Canada 
          rules, to be a sactioned race there must be 10 or more cars, and if 
          there are not enough cars the most points a driver can earn are 39 compared 
          to the full 40 when their is a full field of cars.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The path to the 
          Canadain championship has drivers competing in as many sactioned races 
          as possible and at the end of the season the driver with the best 12 
          race results becomes the champion. Last season saw Beaulieu travel all 
          over BC and Alberta to compete in races where 40 point nights were always 
          possible, and most nights this goal was achieved, making it look more 
          likely that Beaulieu may be forced to choose the same strategy again 
          this season. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">After two 40 point 
          nights and a 33 point effort so far this season, the two-time Canadain 
          Champion managed a strong 39 point effort on Saturday night by winning 
          the 40 lap main event, and in doing so collected his 2nd straight Bob 
          Kelly Memorial Trophy for earning the most points out of 9 cars. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">After a bad crash 
          in the 2nd heat eliminated two cars, the remaining 7 modifieds lined 
          up for the 40 lap main event which became a follow-the-leader race on 
          a one-groove track. Earlier in the evening, a transmisson line broke 
          on <b>Ralph von Kampen's</b> stock car which oiled down the Black Creek 
          oval.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> Victoria's <b>Robbie 
          Haslam.</b> son of former racer <b>Roy Haslam</b>, lead the field for 
          the first half of the race while everyone else stayed on each other's 
          bumpers, not wanting to go to the outside as they would surely lose 
          positions while searching for the little, if any, traction in the second 
          groove. After new rubber began to get laid down, the pack slowly cut 
          into Haslam's lead with Beaulieu picking his spots to pass. He first 
          got under a sliding <b>Graham Cooke</b> on the 19th lap to move into 
          3rd behind Haslam and <b>Tim Openshaw</b>, who he then passed on the 
          25th lap to claim 2nd spot. On lap 27 Beaulieu found a spot on the outside 
          of the dogleg to power past Haslam to take the lead, which was challenged 
          only briefly by Openshaw on a 31st lap restart, but it wasn't enough 
          to stop Beaulieu from winning his third straight IMCA main event. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Beaulieu's 4th race 
          of the 2002 began with him grabbing fast time with a quick 15.968, not 
          far off <b>Kirt Rompain's</b> 1997 track record lap time of 15.68. After 
          a four lap run in the A dash, Beaulieu grabbed a 2nd place finish behind 
          <b>Lawrence O'Connor</b> in the first heat, then watched as the 2nd 
          heat got cancelled after a first lap crash involving <b>Jim Thompson</b>, 
          <b>Haslam</b> and <b>Don Banasky</b> which caused a nearly 1 hour delay 
          after Banasky was shook up and had to be nearly removed from his car 
          before he eventually climbed out on his own. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">This weekend will 
          see Beaulieu travel to Victoria with hopes of at least 10 or more cars, 
          and the following weekend he travels to Vernon where the car count is 
          always big and will give Beaulieu a good shot of collecting another 
          40 point night. A good 40 point effort next week at Western Speedway 
          would drop his magic number to 7, the number of 40-pointers he would 
          need to win another Canadain Championship. </font></p>

        stock car driver, <b>Wade Bland</b>, is heading for the bigger leagues

        Wade and his dad, <b>Al Bland</b> are preparing their '99 Monte Carlo 
        for the <b>NASCAR Late Model Super Stock Series</b>. If there is enough 
        financial backing, the team will take in the entire 10 race series than 
        runs on the <b>South Sound Speedway</b> at <b>Tenino, Wash</b>. Otherwise, 
        they will do at least three races at the South Sound track which is owned 
        by former Western Speedway promoter, <b>Butch Behn</b>. The season opener 
        is April 13. "It is a very competitive series," Al said, and with the 
        NASCAR Northwest Tour joining the Late Models on occasion - just to make 
        the field would be something. There is a chance that Wade will be seen 
        at the <b>Dynomax Late Model Superstock Series</b> event which is coming 
        to Western Speedway on July 6.<br>

        heads up the team that will take in the 10 race series which kicks off 
        on April 13. Keith has always been a top contender wherever he ran, although 
        last year was not a year they would like to see a repeat of. According 
        to the elder Armstrong, "2001 was a year from hell. We tried four races 
        - three were rained out and the fourth the motor blew." Besides the Tenino 
        Series, Keith who will drive a '99 Monte Carlo, will also run a few NASCAR 
        Northwest Tour shows, with their first Tour race coming up at Monroe.<br>
