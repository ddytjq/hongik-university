        The purpose of this web page is to set forth in some manner the method
        with which we treat numbers at IonSource.Com.&nbsp; We are aware that
        there are many great significant figure tutorials presented on the
        internet and we agree that this presentation does not necessarily add
        anything new to those discussions, for a list of some of these other web
        pages see the links at the bottom of this page.&nbsp; The sole purpose
        of this presentation is to describe to the reader how we deal with
        significant figures and rounding exclusively at IonSource.Com.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">Scientists routinely attempt to describe the world with numbers and if
        you are a mass spectroscopist you had better love numbers because in
        many instances they are all you have, except perhaps for the occasional flaming
        turbo.&nbsp; As a good friend once told me, &quot;Every credible scientific study
        should be reducible to a table filled with meaningful significant
        numbers.&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">It is important to establish a a policy
        with which you treat numbers.&nbsp; Some companies go so far as to
        establish a document called an SOP, standard operating procedure.&nbsp; Then when a regulatory agency comes to call
        and when they need show them how they derived an assay result without bias,
        they can point to the SOP and say, &quot;See, we passed this release
        test by 0.00001 glicks because our SOP tells us to always round up in
        this situation.&quot;&nbsp; The situation you do not want to be in is
        the one where you barley pass a test because the analyst always rounds
        up but the regulatory agency finds instances where another analyst, or
        worse the same analyst, did something else in a different situation.&nbsp;This
        can lead the agency to the conclusion that you only round up when you
        need to pass a test.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">Even if you are not answerable to a
        regulatory agency and the world does not rest on your shoulders you will
        gain respect from your peers by treating numbers with respect and by
        reporting only significant figures and by rounding properly.</font></p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"><font size="5"><b><a name="What is a significant figure?">What is a significant figure?</a></b>&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">There are two types of significant
        figures, measured and exact.
        </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3"><br>
        <br>
        </font><font size="5"><b><a name="Measured Significant Figures">Measured
        significant figures</a><br>
        <br>
        </b></font><font size="3">As scientists we get a large amount of the
        figures we report and use in calculation from&nbsp; measured
        observation. Whether a digit is determined to be significant or not is
        determined by the capability of the measuring device.</font>&nbsp; <font size="3">In
        a number derived from a measurement the last significant digit to the right
        inherently expresses an uncertainty.&nbsp; For example if you are sure that your
        low resolution quadrupole type mass spectrometer can deliver accurate
        measurements to a tenth of a mass unit then you would be justified in
        reporting masses to a tenth of a mass unit.&nbsp; For example if one measured
        a mass of 110.1 u this number would contain four significant figures
        with the last digit expressing the </font><font size="3">uncertainty</font><font size="3">.&nbsp;
        The uncertainty would be plus or minus 0.05 u.&nbsp; Even if the
        instrument is capable of reporting 10 digits passed the decimal point one
        should only report the significant digits.&nbsp; Errors can arise in
        calculations if insignificant figures are used in a calculation.&nbsp;
        If a number resulting from a measurement is used in a <a name="calculation"> calculation</a>
        that involves multiplication or division all significant figures
        should be carried through the calculation and then the result should be
        rounded at the end of the calculation to reflect the term used in the
        calculation with the fewest significant figures. For example 10.4 X 5.0
        should be reported as <font color="#0000FF">52</font> and not
        52.0.&nbsp; If the calculation involves addition and subtraction a
        different rule applies, one should preserve common decimal places of the
        numbers involved.&nbsp; For example if two numbers obtained from a
        measurement are used in an addition, <font color="#0000FF">10.1</font> +
        <font color="#0000FF">1000.2</font>34 the reported number should be <font color="#0000FF">1010.3</font>.
        Notice that 10.1 has 3 significant figures and 1000.234 has 7
        significant figures and the result of the addition has 5 significant
        figures.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="3"><b><a name="General rules for determining the number of significant figures in a number">General rules for determining the
        number of significant figures in a number</a>:</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3"><b>A)</b> All non-zero numbers are
        significant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3"><b>B) </b>All zeros between significant
        numbers are significant, f<font color="#000000">or example the number</font><font color="#0000FF">
        1002&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000"> has 4 significant figures.<br>
        <br>
        </font><b>C)</b> A zero after the decimal point is significant when
        bounded by significant figures to the left, f<font color="#000000">or
        example the number</font><font color="#0000FF"> 1002.0&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000">
        has 5 significant figures.</font></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3"><b>D)</b> Zeros to the left of a
        significant figure and not bounded to the left by another significant
        figure are not significant.
        For example the number 0.0<font color="#0000FF">1 </font><font color="#000000">only
        has one significant figure.</font></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3"><b>E)</b>  Numbers ending with zero(s)
        written without a decimal place posses an inherent ambiguity. To remove the ambiguity
        write the number in scientific notation. For example the number 1600000
        is ambiguous as to the number of significant figures it contains, the same
        number written <font color="#0000FF">1.600</font> X 10<sup>6 </sup>obviously
        has four significant figures.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">Several Notes:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">1)&nbsp; It is important to know the
        accuracy and precision of the measuring device one is using and it is
        important to report only those digits that have significance. To
        reiterate, your electrospray mass spectrometer may be able to spit out
        10 numbers past the decimal place but you should only use the digits that have significance in reporting or in a calculation.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">2) It is generally accepted that the uncertainty
        is plus or minus 1 unit at the level of the uncertainty,
        for example the &quot;true value&quot; for the number 0.003 can be described as
        being bounded by the numbers 0.002 and 0.004.&nbsp; It is important to
        note that in some instances scientists will sometimes want to express an uncertainty
        that exceeds 1 at the level of
        the uncertainty and this should be noted explicitly in the following fashion, 0.003 ± 0.002</font></p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"><font size="5"><b><a name="Exact Numbers">Exact Numbers</a></b></font><p align="left"><font size="3">Exact
        values are those that are counted without ambiguity, for example the number
        of mass spectrometers in the lab is exactly three, or the number of cars in the
        parking lot is exactly four.&nbsp; These numbers carry no ambiguity and can be
        considered to have an infinite number of significant figures.&nbsp; When
        using these numbers in a calculation the restriction on reporting is
        borne by the measured number if any.</font>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><b><a name="Rounding Significant Figures">Rounding
      significant figures</a><br>
      </b></font><font size="3">(now it gets personal)</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="3">As far as I can tell rounding of
      significant figures carries a certain degree of controversy and people
      will argue with you based on what they were taught at some point in their
      education. For example I learned from my &quot;Biostatistics&quot; course
      in college that when rounding a number that is followed by a 5, for example
      1.1150, one should round up to the even number, 1.12 or not round up if
      the number was already even.&nbsp; The explanation that the professor gave
      was that even numbers are easier to deal with in a calculation, which now
      seems to me like an odd reason. More recently I have been told from
      statisticians that I respect that this procedure removes the rounding
      bias.&nbsp; They explain that without bias half of the time the number is
      rounded up, to me this makes a lot of sense, after all as scientists we
      want to be as unbiased as humanly possible.&nbsp; Others always round up
      in this situation regardless of whether the number is even or odd.&nbsp;
      Our position on this subject is we don't care what you do, but you should
      establish your own policy and follow it absolutely consistently, but of
      course just so you will understand, the method we have adopted is correct
      (a little joke). </font><font size="3" color="#000000">Another painful
      detail that can cause controversy is that if the number following the 5 is
      not a zero, for example 1.1151, the number should be rounded up. This is
      the policy that we follow.&nbsp; Again set your own policy or if you are
      working with a larger group follow that policy. Be consistent.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="3"><b>Rounding policies that everyone agrees
      with:</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="3">If you are rounding a number to a certain
      degree of significant digits if the number following that degree is less
      than five the last significant figure is not rounded up, if it is greater
      than 5 it is rounded up.<br>
      <br>
      Examples:&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="3">A) 10.5660 rounded to four significant
      figures is <font color="#0000FF">10.57</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">B) 10.5640 <font size="3">rounded to four significant
      figures is <font color="#0000FF">10.5</font><font color="#0000FF">6</font></font></p>
