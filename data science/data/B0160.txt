        <p class="body">At Leeds &amp; Holbeck, we understand
        how important it is that you choose the right mortgage. Whether you’re
        moving home, buying your first property or moving your mortgage from
        another lender, you need to be sure you’ve lined up the best possible
        deal. This booklet will provide an introduction to the process of
        arranging a mortgage, as well as helping you decide which type of
        mortgage is right for you. It’s written in straightforward language,
        with the intention of bringing you straightforward facts – that’s
        the Leeds &amp; Holbeck way. There’s even a ‘Jargon-Buster’
        section to go through some of the mortgage-related terms that you can’t
        always avoid!&nbsp;</p>

              <p class="body"><b>Fixed Rate Mortgage</b><br>This
              type of mortgage offers you the peace of
              mind that whatever happens to interest
              rates, your mortgage repayments won’t be
              affected during the period that your rate is
              fixed. Rates can generally be fixed from
              between 2 and 10 years - at the end of which
              your loan will normally switch to our
              competitive Standard Variable Rate.</p>
              <p class="body"><b>Discounted Rate Mortgage</b><br>This mortgage type gives you a
              discount off our Standard Variable Rate for
              a fixed period of time. The rate applying to
              your account may go up or down in this time, but will, of course, always remain at a
              lower
              level than would have been the case under
              our Standard Variable Rate. This option
              would leave you with lower monthly
              repayments over a period when you may well
              appreciate a little extra cash, especially
              if you’ve just moved into a new home.</p>
              <p class="body"><b>Capped Rate Mortgage</b><br>A capped rate
              mortgage guarantees
              that your payments will not rise above an agreed maximum (the ‘cap’) for a set
              period, just like a fixed rate
              mortgage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="body">The difference is that if
              our Standard Variable Rate falls below this
              agreed maximum, the rate applying to your account will also fall.&nbsp;</p>
              <p class="body">This double benefit means that the
              rate is usually set higher than a comparable
              fixed rate mortgage - but you can rest
              assured that your payments will never rise
              above a set level, and they may even go
              down.</p>
              <p class="body"><b>Flexible Mortgage</b><br>People who want to pay off their
              mortgage early or expect their financial circumstances
              to vary during its term may find this type
              of loan particularly attractive.</p>
              <p class="body">Our Flexible Mortgage allows you to
              make additional payments of any amount, at
              any time, without incurring any Early Repayment Charges.&nbsp; So you can make a
              one-off
              payment to bring down the amount you pay
              each month, or continue with your existing
              payments and reduce the term of your
              mortgage. You also have the option to take
              ‘payment holidays’ against any
              overpayments you have made – something you
              may find useful if you’re planning a
              career break or starting a family.</p>

                          mortgage you want, you’ll need to decide how to
                          repay it. Many people consider this to mean deciding
                          between a repayment or interest only mortgage – but
                          there’s actually more than this to think about.</p>
                          <p class="body">Whichever mortgage you choose, you’ll
                          need to repay the capital (the amount you’ve
                          borrowed) and pay interest – usually on a monthly
                          basis.</p>

                          depends on whether you choose to arrange your mortgage on a
                    capital and interest or an interest only basis. These
                    options are explained in more detail below.</td>

                    <p class="body"><b>Capital and Interest</b></p>
                    <p class="body">This arrangement (traditionally known as a
                    repayment mortgage) involves paying back the interest and
                    part of the capital on a monthly basis until the entire
                    amount borrowed is eventually paid back over the mortgage
                    term.</p>
                    <p class="body">You’re certain that your mortgage will be
                    repaid in full at the end of the term, as long as you make
                    all your monthly payments. </p>
                    <p class="body">You should take careful note of the fact
                    that no life cover is included with this type of mortgage.
                    We would strongly advise you to protect your family home by
                    making sure you’ve enough life cover to pay off your
                    mortgage in the event of your death.</p>
                    <p class="body"><b>Interest Only</b></p>
                    <p class="body">Choose this option and your mortgage
                    payments to the Society will consist of interest only. The
                    capital should be repaid at the end of the mortgage term
                    from the proceeds of an investment set up by you – this
                    could be an endowment, a pension, ISA or another existing
                    investment. You may select any, or a combination, of these
                    options.</p>
                    <p class="body">With an interest only mortgage it is your
                    responsibility to make suitable arrangements for the
                    repayment of the capital at the end of the mortgage term.
                    From time to time you should check with your financial
                    advisor that your arrangements are adequate – you should
                    remember that your investments may not provide the final
                    return you were anticipating. If, at the end of your
                    mortgage term, the proceeds from your investments are
                    insufficient to repay the capital outstanding, you will have
                    to find the deficit from elsewhere. You will also need to
                    check whether adequate life cover is included with your
                    chosen investment, to ensure that the capital would be
                    repaid in the event of your death. Before making a decision
                    on which type of investment may be suitable, you should
                    check with a financial advisor. Some basic information on
                    different types of investment that may be used to repay
                    capital at the end of a mortgage term, is set out below.</p>
                    <p class="body"><b>Endowments</b></p>
                    <p class="body">An endowment policy is effectively a long
                    term savings scheme where payments are made into a central
                    fund. The fund would usually be invested in the stock
                    market. Payments are made directly to the investment or
                    insurance company offering the endowment, rather than the
                    Society.&nbsp; When an endowment matures the proceeds (or a
                    relevant portion if there is a surplus) should be paid to
                    the Society to reduce or fully repay the balance
                    outstanding. Life cover is included with endowments.</p>
                    <p class="body"><b>Pension</b></p>
                    <p class="body">Some people choose to use their pension
                    plan(s) to repay outstanding capital at the end of their
                    mortgage term. The tax free lump sum available from the
                    policy on maturity is used to reduce or fully repay the
                    balance outstanding (It is important to ensure that maturity
                    of the policy coincides with the end of the mortgage term).
                    The main consideration for people choosing this option is
                    that they will still have sufficient money from their
                    pension to live on in retirement. Life cover can be included
                    with a pension policy.</p>

                    <p class="body"><b>How much is your income?</b><br>The most
                    important element in deciding how much we’ll lend you is
                    your income. If you’re buying your home with someone else,
                    then we’ll consider both of your incomes.</p>
                    <p class="body">Naturally, we’ll consider long-term
                    bonuses, overtime and commission provided all payments are
                    guaranteed and part of your regular disposable income. We
                    will also consider regular overtime, bonus and commission
                    but will only include half of the value in our calculations.
                    This is how we calculate the maximum amount we’ll lend:</p>
                    <p class="body">To work out how much this means you could be
                    able to borrow, simply use the table above. e.g. if your
                    salary is £25,000 and your partner’s salary is £10,000,
                    your borrowing limit would be £91,250.</p>
                    <p class="body"><b>What's your property worth?</b><br>Before we
                    make you a mortgage offer, we’ll need to take into account the value
                    of any property you’re looking to buy or remortgage if you already own the
                    property concerned. This may include arranging for a valuation to be carried
                    out. This is solely for our purposes and should not be taken as a guarantee of the
                    propertys’ value, nor that the property is in good condition throughout.&nbsp;
                    With this in mind, we recommend that you arrange for a professional surveyor or
                    valuer to inspect the property on your behalf. Peace of mind is priceless
                    - and we want your new home to be a source of pleasure to you.</p>
                    <p class="body">It’s important that you bear in mind your loan may not cover the total value or
                    purchase price of your property. This means that if you’re moving to a new
                    home, rather than remortgaging, you may need to use some money of your
                    own as a deposit. The Loan to Value (LTV) percentage refers to how much the loan
                    will cover of the value or purchase price of your property -
                    whichever is lower.</p>
                    <p class="body"><b>What if interest rates go up?</b><br>It’s
                    worth considering what the effect of any future interest
                    rate rises might have on your finances. Even if you choose a
                    fixed or capped rate mortgage, the interest rate will
                    normally revert to our Standard Variable Rate at the end of
                    the Benefit Period (this term is defined in the &quot;Jargon
                    Buster&quot; section of this guide). Your Mortgage Advisor
                    will be able to help you with budget planning – but it’s
                    important that you think carefully about what you can really
                    afford.</p>

                    is transferred from a joint name to a single name or vice
                    versa. If you think this may apply ask your legal
                    representative for further details.</p>
                    <p class="body"><b>Higher Lending Fee</b></p>
                    <p class="body">If you’re borrowing an amount greater than
                    75% of the value of the property, the Society may charge a
                    Higher Lending Fee depending upon the product. The fee will
                    normally be deducted from the amount of your mortgage
                    advance before completion. Your Mortgage Advisor will
                    calculate how much this will be, if applicable.</p>
                    <p class="body">The fee may be used to insure the Society if
                    the worst happens and your property is repossessed and
                    subsequently sold for less than the amount you owe. You will
                    remain liable to pay the full amount owing, including
                    arrears interest and legal fees. If our insurers pay a
                    claim, generally speaking they will have the right to
                    recover the amount from you.</p>

                    <p class="body">Estate agents services are always free to
                    the buyer, so you’ll only have to budget for their fees if
                    you’re selling your existing home. Fees are usually based
                    on a percentage of the sale price, though they may sometimes
                    be a fixed amount.</p>
                    <p class="body"><b>Solicitors / Licensed Conveyancer</b></p>
                    <p class="body">It’s often worth getting a few quotes from
                    different firms before appointing a legal representative. It
                    will be more cost effective to select a legal representative
                    who has been approved to carry out work on behalf of the
                    Society. Your Mortgage Advisor will confirm which solicitors
                    / licensed conveyancer in your area are able to do this. For
                    remortgages the Society is able to offer a competitive ‘in-house’
                    service and this may be free with some products.</p>
                    <p class="body"><b>Surveys</b></p>
                    <p class="body">We always recommend that you have your
                    prospective new home surveyed independently. Several
                    different levels of report are available, at different
                    rates. The Society may be able to arrange this for you at a
                    competitive rate. Any survey you have carried out will be in
                    addition to the valuation undertaken on behalf of the
                    society for which there will be charge.</p>
                    <p class="body"><b>Removals</b></p>
                    <p class="body">Charges vary considerably – you might like
                    to ask at least three removal companies to come to your home
                    to assess what will be involved and give you a quote well in
                    advance.</p>

                          Fee</b> – This is a one-off fee payable towards the
                          set up costs of some mortgages. It’s not normally
                          refundable, even if the mortgage does not complete.
                          <p><b>Benefit Period</b> – This is the length of
                          time that a discounted, fixed, or capped rate applies
                          to a mortgage. For example, a mortgage with a two-year
                          fixed rate would have a benefit period of two years.</p>
                          <p><b>Capital</b> – Any sum of money that we may
                          lend to you – ordinarily to purchase a property or
                          on a remortgage transaction to repay another lender.
                          Interest will be payable on capital from the date the
                          funds are released by the Society.</p>
                          <p><b>Completion</b> – The final stage of the
                          conveyancing process after exchange of contacts –
                          when keys change hands (on a sale or purchase) and
                          your mortgage with the Society is set up.</p>
                          <p><b>Conveyancing</b> – Conveyancing is the legal
                          process necessary wherever property or land is bought
                          or sold. This is most often carried out by solicitors
                          or licensed conveyancers on behalf of buyers and
                          sellers.</p>
                          <p><b>Early Repayment Charge</b> – Many products are
                          offered with highly competitive incentives at the
                          start of a mortgage term. Such products can only be
                          offered on the assumption that you keep your mortgage
                          with the Society for a fixed period of time. In such
                          circumstances, although you are of course free to move
                          house and/or remortgage at any time, an early
                          repayment charge will be incurred if you repay (or in
                          some cases, partly repay) the Capital within the Early
                          Repayment Period.</p>
                          <p><b>Early Repayment Period</b> – This is the
                          period of time during which an Early Repayment Charge
                          may be payable. If applicable to the product chosen,
                          full details will be set out in any mortgage offer
                          made by the Society.</p>
                          <p><b>Exchange of Contracts</b> – This is the
                          process where both parties formally agree to the
                          sale/purchase of a property and set a completion date.
                          Normally, this is arranged through a solicitor or
                          licensed conveyancer.</p>
                          <p><b>Loan to Value</b> – Often referred to as LTV,
                          Loan to Value is a percentage figure used to express

                          (when buying a new home) can vary from one type of

                          local authority, including information on planning

                          of a property. Local searches will usually be carried
                          out by your legal representative and can take several
                          weeks to complete.</p>

                          Where no Local Search is made, usually on a remortgage
                          transaction, an insurance policy can be put in place

                          to cover against any risks that may have been revealed

                          but still worth defining. A mortgage is a loan secured
                          on property. The mortgage will remain in place until
