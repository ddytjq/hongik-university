<h5 align="center"><b>Types Of Advertising/Prices</b></h5>

<p align="center">*** NOTE:   ALL PRICES LISTED BELOW ARE IN US FUNDS ***</p>

      <p><font size="4" color="#01445a"><strong>Standard Outfitter Link:</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        This option is for the outfitter who already owns a website. The information 
        included in the link is standardized. It will contain the Outfitter Name, 
        Mailing Address, Location Hunted, Species Hunted, 60 - 75 word description 
        of your hunting operation, a direct link to your email address, a direct 
        link to your website, and your phone number. If you take a moment to browse 
        through our sections, you will see this format being utilized. The price 
        for this service is $60.00 for 6 months, or $108.00 per year (10% savings). 
        VISA or MASTERCARD payments are required for semi-annual accounts. Annual 
        accounts have the option to pay by check, money order or credit card.</p>      
      <p><font size="4" color="#01445a"><strong>Web Page Design:</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        This option is for the outfitter just getting started who is looking for 
        a quality website at a very affordable price. Your website will include 
        up to 5 color pictures of your choice, and up to 1000 words of text. Basically 
        it would be just like an online brochure. Check out some web pages we 
        have designed for other outfitters already listed on our site like <a href="timberline.htm" target="_blank">Timberline 
        Outfitters Guide Service</a>, <a href="safarinordik_bc.htm" target="_blank">Bear 
        Lake Outfitters</a>, or <a href="jsguidesvc.html">J &amp; S Guide Service</a>. 
        These are only 3 of many webpages we have designed but it will give you 
        an idea of the high quality work we do. The price for this service is 
        $270.00 per year. This price includes a free link to your website! Annual 
        accounts have the option to pay by check, money order or credit card. 
      </p>


<p><font size="4" color="#01445a"><strong>Front Page Banner Advertising:</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a great way to significantly increase traffic to your website.  With this option we will take a photo of your choice, place a 3 - 4 word slogan of your choice, your outfitter name and place it on our front page.  As you can see the advantage to this advertising option is obvious.  Every single hunter who comes to the front page of our site will see your add, and have the opportunity to launch your website from our front page.  The price for this service is $225.00 per quarter, or $405.00 for 6 months (10% savings), or $720.00 per year (20% savings).  We are only selling a limited number of these banners.  Once they are all sold, interested outfitters will be placed on a waiting list. VISA or MASTERCARD payments are required for quarterly and semi-annual accounts.  Annual accounts have the option to pay by check, money order or credit card.</p>


      <p><font size="4" color="#01445a"><strong>Regional Banner Advertising:</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        This is the exact same concept as front page banner advertising, only 
        it is placed at the regional level. However, it will not give you the 
        exposure of a front page banner account, it will still give you an advantage 
        over a link in a given state. These banners appear above the States/Provinces 
        listed at the Regional level. This will allow the hunter to click on your 
        website without having to surf through the individual states to find you. 
        For an example of this type of advertising click on our Western Region, 
        and you will notice the Banner Accounts that appear above the states. 
        The price for a regional banner is $60.00 per quarter, or $ 114.00 for 
        6 months (5% savings), or $216.00 (10% savings) per year. We are only 
        going to offer 4 of these regional banners per region. Once they are sold 
        out, interested outfitters will be placed on a waiting list. VISA or MASTERCARD 
        payments are required for quarterly and semiannual accounts. Annual accounts 
        have the option to pay by check, money order or credit card.</p>


      <p><font size="4" color="#01445a"><strong>Multi Listing Discount:</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        This option is for the Booking Agent or Hunting Consultant that is interested 
        in a link in several different regions. For this option we taylor a specific 
        link for each region that the account is located with specific information 
        relative to that region. The price for each link is $15.00 per quarter, 
        or $27.00 (5% savings) for 6 months, or $54.00 (10% savings) per year. 
        To determine your total cost, simply multiply the billing cycle you prefer 
        by the number of regions you wish to be placed in. For example, if you 
        are a hunting consultant who would like to be listed in Canada, Western 
        US, and Southern US, your cost would be either $45.00 per quarter, or 
        $81.00 for 6 months, or $162.00 per year. In addition to the actual listings, 
        we also place all of our Hunting Consultants on our front page pull down 
        menu which also serves as a direct link to their site. This is provided 
        at no additional cost. VISA or MASTERCARD payments are required for quarterly 
        and semiannual accounts. Annual accounts have the option to pay by check, 
        money order or credit card.</p>
