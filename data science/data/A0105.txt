    <td><span class="blockheading">You should read these notes before using the decision trees.<br>
<br>
Decision trees provide information and help you to answer the question:<br>
'Would a stakeholder pension be a good choice for me as part of my financial planning for
retirement?'<br>
<br>
What is a stakeholder pension?<br>
</span><span class="bodytext">A stakeholder pension is a <b>new private pension</b>, it's <b>not a State pension</b>. You can get a stakeholder pension if you are in employment, a fixed-contract worker,
self-employed, or even not working but able to afford contributions. You can get one from
a bank, building society, insurance company, investment company, or through a financial
adviser.<br>
<br>
You pay contributions regularly which are invested to build up your own pension fund. You
can also pay lump-sum contributions whenever you like.<br>
<br>
When you retire, you use your pension fund to buy an 'annuity'. The annuity will pay you a
regular income during your retirement. That income will depend on the size of your fund
and the annuity rates at the time you take your pension.<br>
<br>
You can't withdraw any money from your fund before you take your pension. But when you
take your pension you can choose to have up to 25% of your fund as a tax-free lump sum.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="blockheading"><br>
What's new about stakeholder pensions?<br>
</span><span class="bodytext">Stakeholder pensions must meet the standards laid down by the government.<br>
<br>
The standards include:<br>
</span><span class="bodytext"><ul class="square"><li>Charges</li></ul></span><span class="bodytext">Providers of stakeholder pensions usually charge for managing your money. There is an
upper limit on this charge. The limit is 1% of the value of your fund each year. The
charge is taken from your fund. So if your fund is worth &pound;5,000, a 1% charge would
be &pound;50.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="bodytext"><ul class="square"><li>Flexibility</li></ul></span><span class="bodytext">You can contribute regularly or occasionally. It is always best to make regular weekly or
monthly contributions but you can change the amount. You can pay in as little as
&pound;20, and you can stop paying in without having to pay any penalty and restart later.<br>
<br>
If you are employed and your employers provide a stakeholder pension, they may, if you
wish, deduct your contributions direct from your pay and put them into your pension fund.<br>
<br>
You can take your stakeholder pension with you when you change jobs. You can switch to
another stakeholder pension at any time if you want to, without having to pay any charges
for the transfer.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="bodytext"><ul class="square"><li>Information</li></ul></span><span class="bodytext">Your stakeholder pension provider must give you regular information about your fund. This
will include an annual statement to let you know how much you have paid in and how your
fund is growing. It may also include a forecast of how much your pension might be.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="blockheading"><br>
Will I get any tax relief?<br>
</span><span class="bodytext">Everybody who contributes to a stakeholder pension will get tax relief on their
contributions.<br>
<br>
Under present tax arrangements, for each &pound;1 you pay into your stakeholder pension
fund, the Inland Revenue will pay an extra 28p into your fund, even if you don't normally
pay income tax.<br>
<br>
</span><table class="contenttable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4"><tr><td class="tablerow"><span class="bodytext">Example - If you pay in &pound;50 a month, the income tax relief will increase your
contribution to &pound;64.10. </span></td></tr></table><span class="bodytext"><br>
<br>
Anyone can contribute up to &pound;3,600 to a stakeholder pension in any tax year,
including basic-rate tax relief. What this means is that you could pay in &pound;2,808 and
the income tax relief would increase your contribution to &pound;3,600.<br>
<br>
If you are employed or self-employed you might be able to contribute more than
&pound;3,600 and still get income tax relief, depending on your age and earnings. For
example, up to age 35 you can contribute up to 17.5% of your earnings in any tax year. If
you are over 35, there is a scale that allows you to contribute higher percentages of your
earnings. The Inland Revenue sets the limits on what you can contribute to a pension
scheme.<br>
<br>
If you pay income tax at the higher rate you will be able to claim back the extra tax from
the Inland Revenue at the end of each tax year.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="blockheading"><br>
Won't the State pensions be enough for me to retire on?<br>
</span><span class="bodytext">To answer this question, you need to think about three things:<br>
</span><span class="bodytext"><ul class="square"><li><b>Basic State Retirement Pension</b></li></ul></span><span class="bodytext">If you have a full national insurance contribution record, you are entitled to the full
basic State Retirement Pension. You cannot get your basic State Retirement Pension until
you reach State pension age (currently 65 for men and 60 for women).<br>
<br>
The government reviews the basic State Retirement Pension every year. The rates applying
from April 2001 are shown further on in these notes.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="bodytext"><ul class="square"><li><b>Additional State pension (currently SERPS) </b></li></ul></span><span class="bodytext"><b>Only people in employment qualify for the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS)</b> . The SERPS pension, payable when you reach State pension age, depends on your earnings
while you were in employment and the national insurance contributions you paid. SERPS is
paid in addition to the basic State Retirement Pension.<br>
<b><br>
The government plans to change SERPS in 2002 and rename it the State Second Pension</b>. This will give more help than SERPS to the lowest earners, particularly those earning
less than about &pound;10,000 a year.<br>
<b><br>
Self-employed people do not qualify for the additional State pension (currently SERPS).</b><br>
<br>
</span><span class="bodytext"><ul class="square"><li><b>Guaranteed minimum income and Pension Credit</b></li></ul></span><span class="bodytext">The current Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) is a benefit that helps people with low incomes
in retirement. MIG is means-tested. If you apply, the Department of Social Security
assesses your income and decides whether you get a top-up. If you qualify for a MIG
top-up, or have an income just above the MIG level, you may also qualify for other
benefits, such as housing benefit.<br>
<br>
The government has announced plans to introduce a new Pension Credit from 2003 that
includes a guaranteed minimum income.<br>

Do I need to save more for my retirement?<br>

existing private pensions will be enough for you to live on when you retire. Ask yourself:<br>
</span><span class="bodytext"><ul class="square"><li><b>Roughly how much will I need to live on when I retire?</b></li><li><b>Is the basic State Retirement Pension likely to be enough for me?</b></li><li><b>Will I qualify for an additional pension through SERPS and the State Second Pension?</b></li><li><b>Have I got any other private pensions, maybe from previous employers' schemes or from

</span><span class="blockheading"><br>
Can I afford to contribute regularly to a stakeholder pension?<br>
</span><span class="bodytext">Before you answer this question, you should ask yourself:<br>
</span><span class="bodytext"><ul class="square"><li><b>What are my other financial commitments?</b></li></ul></span><span class="bodytext">For example, mortgage repayments, rent, life assurance, and credit cards. Make sure you do
your sums before using the decision trees.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="bodytext"><ul class="square"><li><b>Would I be prepared, if necessary, to give up anything so that I can pay into a

</li><li><b>Should I be thinking of other things first?</b></li></ul></span><span class="bodytext">For example, life assurance protection for me and my family, or building up some
'rainy-day' cash savings.<br>
<br>
Whatever you decide you can afford, think about increasing your contributions, especially
when your earnings rise.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="blockheading"><br>
I can't afford to contribute much regularly - won't the MIG make my contributions a waste
of money?<br>
</span><span class="bodytext">The government has said that it intends to ensure that all those who have saved already,
or who wish to save in the future, can benefit from those savings when they retire.<br>
<br>
To achieve this, the government has announced proposals to introduce a new Pension Credit
which will overhaul the current MIG arrangements from 2003.<br>
<br>
The proposals are designed to alter the present situation where those who have saved to
build up a second pension, to add to the basic State Retirement Pension, might be little
or no better off than those who haven't saved.<br>
<br>
A lot depends on the final rules for Pension Credit and how it works out in practice. Of
course, future governments can change State pensions and benefits at any time and it may
be unwise to rely on any particular type or level being available when you retire.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="blockheading"><br>
I can't afford to contribute much regularly - so what will I get from my stakeholder
pension?<br>
</span><span class="bodytext">Stakeholder pensions allow contributions as low as &pound;20. But a regular monthly
contribution of &pound;20 will not produce a large pension when you retire. And the older
you are when you start saving, the less time there will be for your pension fund to grow
to something worthwhile. The tables in the decision trees will give you a fair idea of the
pension you could get, depending on your age and contributions.<br>
<br>
The figures in the tables, however, are only estimates and are not guaranteed. They are
also shown before income tax. When you receive your pension during retirement you may be
taxed on it.<br>

</span><span class="blockheading"><br>
What does contracting-out of the additional State pension (currently SERPS) mean for me?<br>
</span><span class="bodytext">Everyone in employment is automatically included inSERPS unless they decide to leave it.
This is called 'contracting-out'. If you contract-out, you give up any SERPS entitlement
and build up a replacement for it in your own private pension arrangement instead. The
private pension could be an employer's pension scheme or your own stakeholder pension
scheme or other personal pension.<br>
<br>
Some employers' occupational pension schemes contract-out all scheme members
automatically. Other employers' occupational schemes are 'contracted-in' and the scheme
pensions are paid on top of any SERPS pensions. If you are in one of these contracted-in
schemes, you can still decide to contract-out.<br>
<br>
You can also decide to contract-out if you are not a member of an employer's occupational
pension scheme. If you contract-out of SERPS this way, the Inland Revenue will pay a
rebate on your national insurance contributions into your private pension fund. The rebate
is invested along with your own pension contributions and you build up a replacement
pension for the SERPS pension given up.<br>
<br>
With stakeholder and other personal pension schemes the government sets the rebate. The
rebate is set to give a reasonable chance that the replacement pension will be at least as
big as if you had remained in SERPS. There's no guarantee that you'll be better off by
contracting-out but generally the younger you are and the more you are earning, the more
you stand to gain if you do contract-out.<br>
<br>
Contracting-out is an important decision and you need to consider all the implications. If
you want help with your decision, you should consult a financial adviser. You may have to
pay for this help. Or you can ask your stakeholder scheme provider for a comparison of the
SERPS pension you'll be giving up and the possible replacement pension you might get from
a private arrangement.<br>
<br>
Deciding to contract-out in one tax year does not commit you to do the same in later
years. In fact, it's a good idea to review your decision regularly. You should do this,
for example, when the State Second Pension starts in 2002.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="blockheading"><br>
What else do I need to check?<br>
</span><span class="blockheading"><ul class="square"><li><b>If you are employed</b></li></ul></span><span class="bodytext">Employers' pension plans are always worth checking first as they usually provide extra
benefits, such as added contributions from your employer or free life assurance.<br>
<b><br>
You need to check:</b><br>
</span><span class="bodytext"><ul class="square"><li>Does your employer provide a pension plan?</li><li>Are you a member of your employer's pension plan?</li><li>If you are not a member, could you join now or later?</li></ul></span><span class="bodytext">If your employer does not provide a pension plan for you at the moment, they may have to
arrange for a stakeholder pension to be available to you by October 2001.<br>
</span><span class="bodytext"><ul class="square"><li>Ask your employer if it is intended to arrange a new pension plan for staff as it might
be better than a private pension you arrange yourself.</li><li>Employers might agree to pay the stakeholder annual charge or make payments to your fund
on top of your own contributions, but they don't have to.<br>
</li><li><b>If you are self-employed</b></li><li><b>Are you contributing to a pension plan?</b></li></ul></span><span class="bodytext">If you have no pension to look forward to except the basic State Retirement Pension, you
should consider setting up a personal pension, such as a stakeholder pension.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="bodytext"><ul class="square"><li><b>If you have no form of paid employment</b></li><li><b>Can you afford to contribute to a pension plan?</b></li></ul></span><span class="bodytext">You can now set up a new stakeholder pension. You can then benefit from tax relief on your<br>
contributions, even if you don't normally pay income tax.<br>
<br>
</span><span class="bodytext"><ul class="square"><li><b>Everybody</b></li></ul></span><span class="bodytext">Check on the pension plans you have contributed to in the past but no longer pay into
today. You need to have some idea of the retirement income you might get from an old
pension plan.<br>
<br>
To check on the value of old pension plans, look at the most recent benefit statements you
have been sent. If you cannot find any statements, contact the pension plan provider, for
example the insurance company or the employer that offered the pension to you.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, the Pension Schemes Registry provides a free tracing service. It can help
you identify pension schemes you have belonged to in the past. To contact the Pensions
