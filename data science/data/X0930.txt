<p align="left"><strong>Driving along State Highway 20 headed towards Valentine, Nebraska,
I was starting to get worried - <em>very worried</em>. Miles upon miles of, well, <em>nothing</em>
passed by the windows of our rented minivan. Staring at vast expanses of grass (and only
grass) for the past 150 miles or so, I found it hard to believe that there was any
whitetail habitat, much less ideal whitetail habitat to be found. <em>It looked more like
the surface of the moon</em>.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>Dusk finally found me, fellow HuntGuide.com ProStaffer Mark Hall,
and fellow hunter Bob Skowronski in downtown Valentine where we met up with Joel Gothard
of Niobrara Hunting Adventures. Joel, who we found to be one of the most modest guides we
have ever met, stated that we would be seeing many deer just on the ride out to the ranch
house where we would be staying. Within a mile or two the scenery changed, and the endless
miles of sand hills yielded to river and creek bottoms all lined with lush greenery. Then
we started seeing deer. One here, five there... now they were <em>everywhere</em>. </strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>Sitting atop a fifteen foot latter stand at 8:45 a.m. later in
week, I reflected on the first few days of sitting of stand in the mornings and evenings
for whitetails while spot and stalking for mulies in between. I had passed up shots on
decent bucks within easy bow range every day of the hunt so far, including one just an
hour ago. I had also seen some much larger, exceptional bucks out of the range of my bow.
While I hadn't yet even drawn back once, and even though the temperatures were
unseasonably hot - I was having the time of my life. </strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>I pulled back my camo sleeve to look at my watch again. &quot;Time
to go&quot;, I thought. Taking one last look around the draw and flat my stand was located
between,&nbsp; I put on my gear and lowered my bow safely to the ground. Half way down the
ladder I found myself frozen completely still when three whitetail racks appeared over a
lip about forty yards away. They were moving my way. </strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>&quot;Great, now what am I going to do!&quot;, my options raced
through my mind. Finally, every time I was confident they were paying more attention to
feeding rather than watching their surroundings, I slowly took a step up and then another.
Before long I was sitting back in my stand. I turned to look over my left should -
amazingly they were still there and still feeding. I didn't want to concentrate on racks
at this point, but the moment got the better of me. </strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>&quot;Look at the one in the middle!&quot; I thought. The eight
pointer was larger than any other deer I have ever taken.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>Then it hit me. &quot;Oh S*#@!&quot;, my bow was still at the
bottom of the tree attached to my pull up cord! The three bucks were 25 yards to the left
and behind me, and still closing in at a steady pace.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>I placed all of my attention to <em>slowly </em>pulling my bow
back to me, making every effort not to click the limbs against the tree or the stand.
Temptation to look back over my shoulder was immense, but I kept my concentration on the
bow, trying to keep movement to a minimum. Finally the bow was back into my hands and I
silently nocked a Muzzy-tipped XX78 onto the string before turning around.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>Fully expecting to see that the deer had spotted me, I was amazed
to see that they were now at 15 yards and still closing. I had one small shooting window
in that direction and the middle buck was coming into it now. I clicked my release onto
the string and brought up the Hoyt Tenacity II into shooting position. A small tree limb
was only slightly in the way, and crouching down I knew I would be able to clear it and
make the 13 yard broadside shot.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong><em>Then it happened.</em> I made the hardest decision of my
bowhunting career to date. In the last second... I let him go. I had, after all, come to
Nebraska to take a <em>huge</em> deer, not just a <em>good</em> deer. </strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>In the remaining days of the hunt I never got a shot at one of the
huge &quot;big boys&quot;, even though we did see them.&nbsp; I did, however, have a
wonderful, and &quot;successful&quot; hunt full of fun times, laughs, good people, good
food, plenty of deer, and good opportunities. </strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>As far as Mark and Bob go, they had a great time too. Sitting in
one of the most scenic tree stands I have ever seen (overlooking a crossing over a winding
creek bordering a marsh and wooded hillside), Mark missed a 150 class 10 pointer in the
morning only to arrow a nice 130 class 8 pointer that same afternoon.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>Bob tried rattling, which I thought would not work in the
unusually hot 80+ degree days of this September. With the area's high buck to doe ration,
he proved me wrong rattling in 3 nice bucks in 3 days. One of those three was a nice 140
class 9 pointer which Bob shot at 12 yards. Unfortuntately the arrow flew high and back
and after a day of hard searching the buck went unrecovered. Bob also had a missed
opportunity at a larger buck.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>As we got back into the minivan to leave to the airport, I had a
smile on my face knowing that I'd be back here next year and the bucks I had passed on
would only be bigger this next time around!</strong></p>
