<H1>The ABC's of Distances</H1>

<P>
It is almost impossible to tell the distances of objects we see in the
sky.  Almost, but not quite, and astronomers have developed a large
variety of techniques.  Here I will describe 26 of them.  I will ignore
the work that went into determining the astronomical unit: the scale
factor for the Solar System, and just consider distances outside of
the Solar System.</P>

<H2>A. TRIGONOMETRIC PARALLAX</H2>

<P>
This methods rates an A because it is the gold standard for astronomical
distances.  It is based on measuring two angles and the included side
of a triangle formed by 1) the star, 2) the Earth on one side of its
orbit, and 3) the Earth six months later on the other side of its orbit.
<BR><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="./parallax.gif" WIDTH=582 HEIGHT=312
ALT="annual parallax diagram">
</CENTER><BR>
The top part of the diagram above shows the Earth at two different times,
and the triangle formed with a nearby star and these two positions of the
Earth.  The bottom part shows two pictures of the nearby star projected
onto more distant stars taken from the two sides of the Earth's orbit.
If you cross your eyes to merge these two pictures, you will either
see the nearby star standing in front of the background in 3-D, or else
get a headache.
</P>

<P>
The <EM>parallax</EM> of a star is one-half the angle at the star in the
diagram above.  Thus the parallax is the angle at the star in an
Earth-Sun-star triangle.  Since this angle is always very small,
the sine and tangent of the parallax are very well approximated
by the parallax angle measured in radians.  Therefore the distance
to a star is
<PRE>
D[in cm] = [Earth-Sun distance in cm]/[parallax in radians]
</PRE>
Astronomers usually say the Earth-Sun distance is 1 <EM>astronomical
unit</EM>, where 1 au = 1.5E13 cm, and measure small angles in arc-seconds.
[Note that 1.5E13 is computerese for 15,000,000,000,000]
One radian has 648000/pi arc-seconds.
If we use these units, the unit of distance is
[648000/pi] au = 3.085678E18 cm = 1 <EM>parsec</EM>.
A star with a parallax of 1 arc-second has a distance of 1 parsec.
No known stars have parallaxes this big.  
<A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap960526.html">Proxima Centauri</A>
has a parallax
of 0.76".  [The double quote is used to denote arc-seconds
(as well as inches).]
</P>

<P>
The first stellar parallax (of the star 61 Cygni) was measured by 
<A
HREF="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Bessel.html">
Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel</A> (1784-1846) in 1838.  
Bessel is also known for the Bessel functions in
mathematical physics.
</P>

<H2>B. Moving Clusters</H2>

<P>
Not many stars are close enough to have useful trigonometric parallaxes.
But when stars are in a stable star cluster whose physical size is not
changing, like the
<A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap950620.html">Pleiades</A>,
then the apparent motions of the stars within the cluster
can be used to determine the distance to the cluster.
<BR><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="./movclstr.gif" WIDTH=475 HEIGHT=240
ALT="Moving cluster parallax">
</CENTER><BR>
The top part of the diagram above shows the space motion of a cluster of
stars.  Notice that the velocity vectors are parallel so the cluster is 
neither expanding nor contracting.  But when we look at the motions of
the stars projected on the sky we see them converging because of
perspective effects.  The angle to the convergent point is theta.
If the cluster is moving towards us then the convergent point is behind
the cluster but there is second convergent point on the opposite side
of the sky and we use that.  From the motions of the stars on the sky,
known as <EM>proper motions</EM> because they are properties of individual
stars, we measure theta and its rate of change, d(theta)/dt.  We also
need the radial velocity VR of the cluster measured using a spectrograph
to see the <A HREF="./doppler.htm">Doppler shift</A>.  
The transverse velocity, VT, (sideways motion) of the cluster can be found 
using <EM>VT/VR = tan(theta).</EM>
The distance of the cluster is then
<PRE>
D[in cm] = VT[in cm/sec]/[d(theta)/dt]

D[in pc] = (VR/4.74 km/sec)*tan(theta)/{d(theta)/dt[in "/yr]}
</PRE>
The odd constant 4.74 km/sec is one au/year.
Because a time interval of 100 years can be used to measure d(theta)/dt,
precise distances to nearby star clusters are possible.
This method has been applied to the
Hyades cluster giving a distance of 45.53 +/- 2.64 pc.
The average of <A HREF="http://astro.estec.esa.nl/Hipparcos/">HIPPARCOS</A>
trigonometric parallaxes for Hyades members gives a
distance of 46.34 +/- 0.27 pc 
(<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9707253">Perryman <EM>et
al.</EM></A>).
</P>

<H2>C. Secular Parallax</H2>

<P>
Another method can be used to measure the average distance to a set of
stars, chosen to be all about the same distance from the Earth.
<BR><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="./stat_par.gif" WIDTH=588 HEIGHT=332
ALT="Statistical and secular parallax">
</CENTER><BR>
The diagram above shows such a set of stars, but with two possible
mean distances.  The green stars show a small mean distance, while 
the red stars show a large mean distance.  Because of the mean motion
of the Solar system at 20 km/sec relative to the average of nearby stars
there will be an average proper motion away from the point of the sky
the Solar System is moving towards.  This point is known as the
<EM>apex</EM>.  Let the angle to the apex be theta.  Then the proper
motion d(theta)/dt will have a mean component proportional to
sin(theta), shown by the lines in the plot of d(theta)/dt vs
sin(theta).  Let the slope of this line be mu.  Then the mean
distance of the stars is
<PRE>
D[in cm] = V(sun)[in cm/sec]/(mu [in radians/sec])

D[in pc] = 4.16/(mu [in "/yr])
</PRE>
where the odd constant 4.16 is the Solar motion in au/yr.
</P>

<H2>D. Statistical Parallax</H2>

<P>
When the stars have measured radial velocities, then the scatter
in their proper motions can be used to determine the mean distance.
It is
<PRE>
                  (scatter in VR)[in cm/sec]
D[in cm] = ----------------------------------------
           (scatter in d(theta)/dt)[in radians/sec]
</PRE>
</P>

<H2>E. Kinematic Distance</H2>

<P>
The pattern of differential rotation in our galaxy can be used
to determine the distance of a source when its radial velocity
is known.
</P>

<H2>F. Expansion Parallax</H2>

<P>
The distance to an expanding object like a supernova remnant like a
supernova remnant such as
<A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap960623.html">Tycho</A>
can be determined by measuring: 
</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>the angular expansion rate
d(theta)/dt using pictures taken many years apart, and
<LI>the radial velocity of expansion, VR, using the <A HREF="./doppler.htm">
Doppler shift</A> of lines
emitted from the front and back of the expanding shell.  When a
spectrograph is pointed at the center of the remnant a double line is
seen, with the red shifted emission coming from the back of the shell
while the blue shifted emission comes from the front.
</OL>
</P>
<P>
The distance is then calculated using
<PRE>
D = VR/d(theta)/dt          with theta in radians
</PRE>
This method is subject to a systematic error when the velocity of the
material behind the shock is less than the velocity of the shock.  In
supernova remnants in the adiabatic phase this is in fact the case, with
<EM>VR = 0.75 V(shock)</EM>, so the calculated distance can be too small by 25%.
</P>

<H2>G. Light Echo Distance</H2>

<P>
The center elliptical 
<A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap960705.html">ring</A>
around SN1987A in the LMC  appears to be due to an inclined circular
ring around the progenitor.  When the pulse of ultraviolet light from
the supernova hit the ring, it lit up in ultraviolet emission lines
which were observed by the 
<A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap950929.html">International 
Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE)</A>.
The first detection of these lines at time, t1, and also the time when
the lines from the last part of the ring to be illuminated, t2, were
both clearly evident in the IUE light curve of the UV lines.
If t0 is the time that we first saw the supernova, then the extra light
travel times to the front and back of the ring are:
<PRE>
t1 - t0 = R(1 - sin(i))/c
t2 - t0 = R(1 + sin(i))/c
</PRE>
where R is the radius of the ring in cm.  Thus
<PRE>
R = c(t1-t0 + t2-t0)/2
</PRE>
When the HST was launched it
took a picture of SN 1987A and saw the ring, and measured the angular
radius of the ring, theta.  The ratio gives the distance:
<PRE>
D = R/theta           with theta in radians
</PRE>
Applied to the LMC using SN 1987A one gets D = 47 +/- 1 kpc.
(Gould 1995, ApJ, 452, 189)
This method is basically the expansion method applied to the expansion
of the shell of supernova radiation that expands at the speed of light.
It can be applied to other known geometries, as well.
</P>

<H2>H. Spectroscopic Visual Binaries</H2>

<P>
If a binary orbit is observed both visually and spectroscopically, then
both the angular size and the physical size of the orbit are known.
The ratio gives the distance.
</P>

<HR>

The following methods need the surface brightness of stars.
The picture below shows how the surface brightness of stars
depends on their colors:
<BR><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="./stars_sb.gif" WIDTH=468 HEIGHT=200
ALT="3 colored circles on a black background">
</CENTER><BR>
The colors correspond approximately to star temperatures of
5000, 6000 and 7000 K.  The color shifts are quite small,
but the surface brightness changes are large: in fact, I have cut
the surface brightness change in half in order to make the cool
star visible.  By measuring the ratio of the blue flux of
a star to its yellow-green flux, astronomers measure the
B-V <A HREF="./magcolor.htm">color</A> of the star.
This measure of the blue:visual flux ratio can be used to estimate
the surface brightness <EM>SB</EM> of the star.  Since the visual flux is
measured as well, the angular radius <EM>theta</EM> of the star is known
from <EM>theta = sqrt[Flux/(pi*SB)]</EM>.
If the physical radius <EM>R</em> can be found as well, the distance
follows from <EM>D = R/theta</EM> with <EM>theta</EM> in radians.

<H2>I. Baade-Wesselink Method</H2>

<P>
The Baade-Wesselink method is applied to pulsating stars.  Using the
color and flux light curves, one finds the ratio of the radii at
different times:
<PRE>
              sqrt[Flux(t2)/SB(Color(t2)]
R(t2)/R(t1) = ---------------------------
              sqrt[Flux(t1)/SB(Color(t1)]
</PRE>
Then spectra of the star throughout its pulsation period are used
to find its radial velocity <EM>Vr(t)</EM>.  Knowing how fast the
star's surface is moving, one finds
<EM>R(t2)-R(t1)</EM> by adding up velocity*time during the time interval
between t1 and t2.  If you know both the ratio of the radii
<EM>R(t2)/R(t1)</EM> from fluxes and colors and the difference in the
radii <EM>R(t2)-R(t1)</EM> from spectroscopy, then you have two
equations in two unknowns and it is easy to solve for the radii.
With the radius and angle, the distance is found
using <EM>D = R/theta</EM>.
</P>

<H2>J. Spectroscopic Eclipsing Binaries</H2>

<P>
In a double-lined spectroscopic binary, the projected size of the orbit
<EM>a*sin(i)</EM> is found from the radial velocity amplitude and the
period.  In an eclipsing binary, the relative radii of the stars
<EM>R1/a</EM> and <EM>R2/a</EM> and the inclination of the orbit
<EM>i</EM> are found by analyzing the shapes of the eclipse light
curves.  Using the observed fluxes and colors to get surface
brightnesses, the angular radii of the stars can be estimated.
<EM>R1</EM> is found from <EM>i</EM>, <EM>a*sin(i)</EM> and <EM>R1/a</EM>;
and with <EM>theta1</EM> the distance can be found.
</P>

<H2>K. Expanding Photosphere Method</H2>

<P>
The Baade-Wesselink method can be applied to an expanding star: the
variations in radius do not have to be periodic.  It has been
applied to Type II supernovae, which are massive stars with a hydrogen
rich envelope that explode when their cores collapse to from neutron stars.
It can also be applied to Type Ia supernovae, but these objects have no
hydrogen lines in their spectra.  Since the surface brightness vs color
law is calibrated using normal, hydrogen-rich stars, the EPM is normally
used on hydrogen-rich supernovae, which are Type II.  The Type II
SN1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud has been used to calibrate this
distance indicator.
</P>

<HR>

The following methods use the H-R diagram of stars, which gives the
luminosity as a function of temperature.  When the luminosity and
flux of an object are known, the distance can be found using
<PRE>
D = sqrt[L/(4*pi*F)]
</PRE>

<H2>L. Main Sequence Fitting</H2>

<P>
When distances to nearby stars were found using trigonometric parallaxes
in the late 19th and early 20th century, it became possible to study
the luminosities of stars.  Einar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell
both plotted stars on a chart of luminosity and temperature.  Most stars
fall on a single track, known as the <EM>Main Sequence</EM>,
in this diagram, which is now known as the H-R diagram after Hertzsprung
and Russell.  Often the <A HREF="./magcolor.htm">absolute magnitude</A>
is used instead of the luminosity, and the spectral type or 
<A HREF="./magcolor.htm">color</A> is used instead of the temperature.
</P>

<P>
When looking at a cluster of stars, the apparent magnitudes and colors
of the stars form a track that is parallel to the Main Sequence, and by
correctly choosing the distance, the apparent magnitudes convert to
absolute magnitudes that fall on the standard Main Sequence.
</P>

<H2>M. Spectroscopic Parallax</H2>

<P>
When the spectrum of a star is observed carefully, it is possible to
determine two parameters of the star as well as the chemical abundances
in the star's atmosphere.  The first of these two parameters is the surface
temperature of the star, which determines the spectral type in the range
OBAFGKM from hottest to coolest.  The hot O stars show ionized helium
lines, the B stars show neutral helium lines, the A stars have strong
hydrogen lines, the F and G stars have various metal lines, and the
coolest K and M stars have molecular bands.  The spectral classes are
further subdivided with a digit, so the Sun is a G2 star.
</P>

<P>
The second parameter that can be determined is the surface gravity of
the star.  The higher the surface gravity, the higher the pressure in
the atmosphere, and high pressure leads to line broadening and also
reduces the amount of ionization in the atmosphere.  
The surface gravity is denoted by the <EN>luminosity class</EM> denoted
by a Roman numeral from I to V with
I being the lowest gravity and V being the highest (except for class VI 
which is sometimes seen and for white dwarfs which separately
classified.)
Stars with high surface gravity (class V) are called <EM>dwarfs</EM>
while stars with medium gravity (class III) are called <EM>giants</EM>
and stars with low gravity (class I) are called
<EM>supergiants</EM>.
The use of surface gravity to determine the luminosity
of a star depends on three relations:
<PRE>
L = 4*pi*sigma*T<SUP>4</SUP>*R<SUP>2</SUP>
L = A*M<SUP>b</SUP>                      Mass-luminosity law with b = 3-4
g = G*M/R<SUP>2</SUP>
</PRE>
Given the temperature from the spectral type, and the surface gravity
from the luminosity class, these equations can be used to find the
mass and luminosity.  If the luminosity and flux are known the distance
follows from the inverse square law.
</P>

<P>
One warning about this method: it only works for normal stars, and any
given single object might not be normal.  Main sequence fitting in a
cluster is much more reliable since with a large number of stars it is
easy to find the normal ones.
</P>

<HR>

The following methods use the properties of pulsating stars:

<H2>N. RR Lyrae Distance</H2>

RR Lyrae stars are pulsating stars like Cepheids, but they are low mass
stars with short periods (less than a day).  They are seen in globular
clusters, and appear to all have the same luminosity.  Since the masses
of RR Lyrae stars are determined by the masses of stars which are
evolving off the main sequence, this constant luminosity may be caused
by the age similarity in globular clusters.

<H2>O. Cepheid Distance</H2>

<P>
Cepheid 
<A HREF="http://www.aavso.org/vstar/whatvariablestars.stm">variable stars</A>
are pulsating stars, named after the first known
member of the class, Delta Cephei.  These stars pulsate because the
hydrogen and helium ionization zones are close to the surface of the
star.  This more or less fixes the temperature of the variable star,
and produces an instability strip in the H-R diagram.
<BR><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="./cepheid1.gif" WIDTH=540 HEIGHT=108
ALT="1.5 cycles of pulsation">
</CENTER><BR>
The diagram above shows the star getting bigger and cooler, then
smaller and hotter.  Cepheids are brightest when they are hottest,
close to the minimum size.  Since all Cepheids are about the same
temperature, the size of a Cepheid determines its luminosity.
A large pulsating object naturally has a longer oscillation period
than a small pulsating object of the same type.  Thus there is
a period-luminosity relationship for Cepheids.  If have two Cepheids
with periods that differ by a factor of two, the longer period Cepheid
is approximately 2.5 times more luminous than the short period one.
Since it is easy to measure the period of a variable star, Cepheids are
wonderful for determining distances to galaxies.
Furthermore, Cepheids are quite bright, so they can be seen in galaxies
as far away as the Virgo cluster, such as
<A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap960110.html">M100</A>
The only problem with Cepheids is the calibration of the
period-luminosity relation, which must be done indirectly using Cepheids
in the Magellanic clouds and Cepheids in star clusters with distances
determined by main sequence fitting.  And one has to worry that the
calibration could depend on the metal abundance in the Cepheids, which
is much lower in the LMC than in luminous spirals like M100.
</P>

<HR>

The following methods use the properties of objects
in galaxies and must be calibrated:

<H2>P. Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function</H2>

<A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap950727.html">Planetary nebulae</A>
are stars which have evolved through the red giant
and asymptotic giant phases, and have ejected their remaining hydrogen
envelope, which forms an ionized nebula surrounding a very hot and small
central star.  They emit large amounts of light in the 501 nm line of
doubly ionized oxygen [O III] which makes them easy to find.  The
brightest planetary nebulae seem to have the same brightness in many
external galaxies, so their fluxes can be used as a distance indicator.
This method is correlated with the Surface Brightness Fluctuation
method, which is sensitive to the asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars before they eject their envelopes.

<H2>Q. Brightest Stars</H2>

When a galaxy is very nearby, individual stars can be resolved.
The brightness of these stars can be used to estimate the distance
to the galaxy.  Often people assume that there is a fixed upper limit to
the brightness of stars, but this appears to be a poor assumption.
Nonetheless, if a large population of bright stars is studied, a
reasonable distance estimate can be made.

<H2>R. Largest H II Region Diameters</H2>

Hot luminous stars ionize the hydrogen gas around them, producing an
H II region like the
<A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap951121.html">Orion
nebula.</A>  The diameter of the largest H II region in external
galaxies has been taken as a "standard rod" that can be used to determine
distances.  But this appears to be a poor assumption.

<A NAME="SBF">
<H2>S. Surface Brightness Fluctuations</H2>

When a galaxy is too distant to allow the detection of individual stars,
one can still estimate the distance using the statistical fluctuation in
the number of stars in a pixel.  A nearby galaxy might have 100 stars
projected into each pixel of an image, while a more distant galaxy would
have a larger number like 1000.  The nearby galaxy would have +/- 10%
fluctuations in surface brightness (1/sqrt(N)), while the more distant
galaxy would have 3% fluctuations.  A
<A HREF="./sbf.gif">figure [75 kB]</A> to illustrate this shows a
nearby dwarf galaxy, a nearby giant galaxy, and the giant galaxy
at a distance such that its total flux is the same as that of the
nearby dwarf.  Note that the distant giant galaxy has a much smoother
image than the nearby dwarf.

<H2>T. Type Ia Supernovae</H2>

Type Ia supernovae are the explosions of white dwarf stars in binary
systems.  Accretion from a companion raises the mass above the maximum
mass for stable white dwarfs, the 
<A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap950901.html">Chandrasekhar</A>
limit.  The white dwarf then starts to collapse, but the compression
ignites explosive carbon burning leading to the total disruption of
the star.  The light output come primarily from energy produced by the
decay of radioactive nickel and cobalt produced in the explosion.
The peak luminosity is correlated with the rate of decay in the light
curve: less luminous supernovae decay quickly while more 
luminous supernovae decay slowly.  
When this correction is applied, the relative luminosity of a
Type Ia SN can be determined to within 20%.  A few SNe Ia have been in
<A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap960514.html">galaxies</A>
close enough to us to allow the 
<A HREF="http://www.stsci.edu">Hubble Space Telescope</A> to
determine absolute distances and luminosities using Cepheid variables,
leading to one of the best determinations of the Hubble constant.
Type Ia supernovae can be seen to such great distances that one
can measure the acceleration or curvature of the Universe using observations
of faint <A HREF="./sne_cosmology.html">supernovae.</A>

<HR>

The following methods use the global properties of galaxies
and must be calibrated:

<H2>U. Tully-Fisher Relation</H2>

The rotational velocity of a spiral galaxy is an indicator of its
luminosity.  The relation is approximately
<PRE>
L = Const * V(rot)<SUP>4</SUP>
</PRE>
Since the rotational velocity of a spiral galaxy can be measured using
an optical spectrograph or radio telescopes, the luminosity can be
determined.  Combined with the measured flux, this luminosity gives the
distance.
The diagram below shows two galaxies: a giant spiral and a dwarf spiral,
but the small galaxy is closer to the Earth so they both cover the same
angle on the sky and have the same apparent brightness.
<BR><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="./tullyfsh.gif" WIDTH=482 HEIGHT=140
ALT="Two spiral galaxies">
</CENTER><BR>
But the distant galaxy has a greater rotational velocity, so the
difference between the redshifted and blueshifted sides of this
distant giant galaxy will be larger.  Thus the relative distances
of the two galaxies can be determined.

<H2>V. Faber-Jackson Relation</H2>

The stellar velocity dispersion sigma(v) of stars in an elliptical
galaxy is an indicator of its
luminosity.  The relation is approximately
<PRE>
L = Const * sigma(v)<SUP>4</SUP>
</PRE>
Since the velocity dispersion of an elliptical galaxy can be measured
using an optical spectrograph, the luminosity can be determined.
Combined with the measured flux, this luminosity gives the
distance.

<H2>W. Brightest Cluster Galaxies</H2>

The brightest galaxy in a
<A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap950710.html">cluster of
galaxies</A> has been used as a standard candle.  This assumption
suffers from the same difficulties that plague the brightest star
and largest H II region methods: rich clusters with many galaxies will
probably have examples of the most luminous galaxies even though these
galaxies are very rare, while less rich clusters will probably not
have such luminous brightest members.

<HR>

The following methods require no calibration:

<H2>X. Gravitational Lens Time Delay</H2>

<P>When a quasar is viewed through a
<A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap951220.html">gravitational
lens</A>, multiple images are seen, as shown in diagram below.  
<BR><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="./qtimdlay.gif" WIDTH=482 HEIGHT=127
ALT="Lensing galaxy forming two images of a background quasar">
</CENTER><BR>
The light paths from the quasar
to us that form these images have different lengths that differ by
approximately D*[cos(theta1)-cos(theta2)] where theta is the deflection
angle and D is the distance to the quasar.  Since quasars are time
variable sources, we can measure the path length difference by looking
for a time-shifted correlated variability in the multiple images.
As of the end of 1996, this time delay has been measured in a few quasars:

<H2>Y. Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect</H2>

<P>Hot gas in clusters of galaxies distorts the spectrum of the cosmic
microwave background observed through the cluster.  
The diagram below shows a sketch of this process.  The hot electrons
in the cluster of galaxies scatter a small fraction of the cosmic
microwave background photons and replace them with slightly higher
energy photons.

</CENTER><BR>
The difference between the CMB seen through the cluster and the
unmodified CMB seen elsewhere on the sky can be measured.
Actually only about 1% of the
photons passing through the cluster are scattered by the electrons in
the hot ionized gas in the cluster, and these photons have their
energies increased by an average of about 2%.  
This leads to a shortage
of low energy photons of about 0.01*0.02 = 0.0002 or 0.02% which is
gives a decrease in the brightness temperature of about 500 microK when
looking at the cluster.  At high frequencies (higher than about 218 GHz)
the cluster appears brighter than the background.  This effect is
proportional to (1) the number density of electrons, (2) the thickness
of the cluster along our line of sight, and (3) the electron
temperature.  The parameter that combines these factors is called the
Kompaneets y parameter, with <EM>y = tau*(kT/mc<SUP>2</SUP>)</EM>.  Tau is the
optical depth or the fraction of photons scattered, while (kT/mc<SUP>2</SUP>) 
is the electron temperature in units of the rest mass of the electron.
</P>

<P>The X-ray emission, <EM>I<SUB>X</SUB></EM>, 
from the hot gas in the cluster is proportional to
(1) the square of the number density of electrons,
(2) the thickness of the cluster along our line of sight, and (3)
depends on the electron temperature and X-ray frequency.
As a result, the ratio
<PRE>
y<SUP>2</SUP>/I<SUB>X</SUB> = CONST * (Thickness along LOS) * f(T)
</PRE>
If we assume that the thickness along the LOS is the same as the
diameter of the cluster, we can use the observed angular diameter to find
the distance.

<P>
This technique is very difficult, and years of hard work by pioneers
like Mark Birkinshaw yielded only a few distances, and values 
of <EM>H<SUB>o</SUB></EM>
that tended to be on the low side.  Recent work with close packed
radio interferometers operating at 30 GHz has given precise measurements
of the radio brightness decrement for 18 clusters, but only a few of these
have adequate X-ray data.  Recent Sunyaev-Zeldovich determinations of the
Hubble constant give 66 from
<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0101169">7 clusters</A>, and 63 from 
<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9912071">2 clusters</A> at redshifts
close to 0.55.

And finally:

<H2>Z. The Hubble Law</H2>

<P>The <A HREF="./doppler.htm">Doppler shift</A>
gives the redshift of a distant object
which is our best indicator of its distance, but
we need to know the <A HREF="./glossary.html#H0">Hubble constant,</A>
H<SUB>o</SUB>.  Then
<PRE>
D = V<SUB>R</SUB>/H<SUB>o</SUB>
</PRE>

But wait, there's MORE!  Pulsar dispersion measures and interstellar
extinction increase with distance along a given line of sight and can be
used to determine distances.
The peak luminosity of a classical

nova</A> can be estimated from its rate of
decay, but the variation has the opposite sense to that of Type Ia SNe:
more luminous 
<A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap990524.html">novae

The globular cluster luminosity function can be used to estimate the
distance to a galaxy from the observed brightness of its globular
clusters.
