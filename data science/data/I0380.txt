<p>In the past year there have been three serious threats to English football
that ran counter to virtually every point mentioned in the <a href="charter.htm">CoFS
charter</a>. Fan power played a significant role in defeating all three threats.</p>
<p>After last summer's World Cup, Media Partners, widely accepted to be a branch
of Silvio Berlusconi's empire, attempted to form a break-away European
Superleague with the intention of basing qualification for this competition on
money making potential rather than merit. The Fans Campaign Against the
Superleague&nbsp; was set up and ran a successful campaign, incorporating over
40 different fans' groups, which helped to defeat Berlusconi's cronies.</p>

<p>Just as the Superleague saga was coming to an end, just as big a story hit
the headlines: BSkyB's proposed takeover of Manchester United. Both IMUSA and
&quot;Shareholders United Against Murdoch&quot; ran vociferous campaigns against
the merger. This persuaded the government to refer the case to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission who blocked the merger on the grounds of it being against
the public interest. For more information on the campaign against the proposed
takeover, visit <a href="http://www.imausa.org.uk/">www.imusa.org.uk</a>&nbsp;

<p>While the MMC was deliberating over the ManU/BSkyB case. The Office of Fair
Trading was continuing its case against the FA Premier League, accusing them of operating
a cartel in respect to selling the television rights for live Premier League
games. The OFT argued that individual clubs should be allowed to sell the TV
rights for their own matches. This could have irreversibly widened the already
growing gap between rich and poor in football; Large clubs would be able to
command huge sums from broadcasters to show their games live while some smaller
clubs would struggle to find anyone to show their matches at all. In a victory
for fans everywhere the OFT was defeated and the rights to show live top flight
football will still be sold by the Premier League, with the revenue being shared
equally amongst all member clubs. Whilst fans were reluctant to specifically
back the Premier League, who could hardly be held up as fighting for a fair
distribution of wealth within the game, this ruling is clearly in line with the
call for a fair distribution of TV revenue, as specified in the CoFS charter.</p>
