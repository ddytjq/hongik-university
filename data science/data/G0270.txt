<P><A NAME="inflation">
<B>inflationary scenario</B>: a modification of the Big Bang model in which

Lyman alpha, Lyman beta, ... and form the Lyman series.
When <EM>n&nbsp;=&nbsp;2</EM>, these lines with 
<EM>m&nbsp;=&nbsp;3, 4, ...</EM> are called
H-alpha, H-beta, ... and form the Balmer series.

<P><A NAME="MACHO">
<B>MACHO</B>: MAssive Compact Halo Object, and also one of 
<A HREF="http://dogwood.physics.mcmaster.ca/">projects</A>
searching for MACHOs by looking for gravitational microlensing: the
other projects are 
<A HREF="http://www.lal.in2p3.fr/EROS/presa.html">EROS</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~stanek/ogle/">OGLE</A>.
A MACHO is an object with a mass
from about 10 billion tons to solar masses.  If it is made out neutrons

magnitude 6.

wavelengths between 0.4 and 0.7 microns.  1 micron is 10,000 Angstroms,

kind have been observed experimentally. A neutralino is one type of
<A HREF="#WIMP">WIMP</A>.
</P>

sources, leading to the name quasi-stellar radio sources, or QSRS, or
<EM>quasars</EM>.  These objects look like stars on an image of the sky, but
their <A HREF="#spectrum">spectra</A> show strong 
<A HREF="#em-line">emission lines</A> at high 
redshift.  The <A HREF="#redshift">redshift</A>

high spots and two low spots.

matter.  Quarks come in six flavors: up, down, charm, strange, top and bottom.
The up, charm and top quarks have electric charges of +(2/3)e, while
the down, strange and bottom quarks have charges of -(1/3)e.  The proton
which has a charge of +e is constructed of two up quarks and one down quark:
(uud), while the neutron is (udd).
</P>

<P><A NAME="redshift">
<B>redshift</B>: the 
<A HREF="#Doppler">Doppler</A> shift for objects receding from the Earth 
causes the <A HREF="./doppler.htm">wavelengths of light to get longer</A>,
and hence shift into the red part of the spectrum.  Because of the expansion
of the Universe, objects with high redshift are far away, and we see them
as they were a long time ago.
</P>

<P><A NAME="spectrum">
<B>spectrum</B>: result of spreading out light by wavelengths.  A
rainbow is a natural <A HREF="./fluxplot.html">spectrum</A>.  
The eye is sensitive to waves from
violet at 380 <A HREF="#micron">nm</A> wavelength to red at 
700 nm wavelength, but astronomers
now study electromagnetic radiation from gamma rays through X-rays,
ultraviolet, violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, red, infrared and radio
waves.
</P>

<P><A NAME="SS">
<B>Steady State</B>: a model of the expanding Universe with constant density 
and  physical properties.   Matter must be continually created to maintain
the constant density.
</P>

<P><A NAME="sr">
<B>steradian</B>: the unit of solid angle.  There are 4*pi steradians
in the entire celestial sphere.  One square degree is (1/57.3)<SUP>2</SUP>
steradians because one degree is (1/57.3) radians.
</P>

<P><A NAME="SNF">
<B>strong nuclear force</B>: one of the four forces of nature.  The strong 
nuclear force holds the particles in the nucleus of atoms together.
</P>

<P><A NAME="time-dilation">
<B>time dilation</B>: in special relativity, moving clocks appear to run 
slowly when compared to stationary clocks.  This clock slowing is called time
dilation.
</P>

<P><A NAME="VED">
<B>vacuum energy density</B>: Quantum theory requires empty space to be 
filled with particles and anti-particles being continually created and
annihilated. This could lead to a net density of the vacuum, which if
present, would behave like a <A HREF="#CC">cosmological constant</A>.
</P>

<P><A NAME="WNF">
<B>weak nuclear force</B>: one of the four forces of nature.  The weak 
nuclear force is responsible for radioactive decay as well as the fusion
reactions in the Sun that provide heat and light for the Earth.
</P>

<P><A NAME="WIMP">
<B>WIMP</B>: a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle, a possible form for
<A HREF="#CDM">cold dark matter</A>.
</P>

<P><A NAME="ZPE">
<B>zero point energy</B>:  the uncertainty principle does not allow a
quantum mechanical system to have a definite position and definite
velocity at the same time.  Thus a <EM>harmonic oscillator</EM> like a
pendulum or a mass on a spring has a minimum energy that is larger than
zero, since zero energy would require a definite position to zero the
potential energy and a definite (zero) velocity to zero the kinetic
energy.  This minimum energy is <EM>0.5*h*f</EM>, where <EM>h</EM> is 
Planck's constant and <EM>f</EM> is the frequency of the oscillator.
