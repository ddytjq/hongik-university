    <td><font SIZE="2">Fans launch bold bid to buy crisis club Tigers Hull City fans are
    uniting in a dramatic effort to buy their beloved club as it staggers from crisis to
    crisis. More than 500 supporters packed an emotional meeting to set up the 'Tigers
    Co-operative'. They aim to look after the interests of supporters and eventually buy a
    stake in the hard-up Third Division club.<p>City supremo David Lloyd, who is trying to
    sell the Boothferry Park outfit, dominated the agenda in his absence. Dyed-in-the-wool
    Tigers' fan Angie Rowe, who chaired the meeting, urged the fans to show the chairman they
    meant business. She said: 'One of the best ways would be to buy him out ourselves. 'It
    would be hard work. But we must form an organisation and work professionally and with the
    right attitude to drum up support from this community to put their hands in their
    pockets.'</p>
    <p>She called for 1,000 supporters to sign a standing order for £10-a-month for 10 months
    to raise £100,000. </font></p>
