<h2>8.14 Why are DJGPP <code>.exe</code> files so large?</h2>

<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: I compiled a trivial "Hello world" program and got a 280KB
executable file.  That's ridiculously bloated!</em>

<br><p>
<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: I switched to GCC 2.95.1, and my C<tt>++</tt> executables are
considerably larger than when compiled with GCC 2.7.2.1!</em>

<br><p>
<p><strong>A</strong>:  Did you link with <code>-s</code> switch to <code>gcc</code>, or run
<code>strip</code> on the output of the linker?  If not, the executable
includes the debugging symbols, which makes it quite a lot larger.  (It
is not recommended to strip the symbols except when distributing
production programs, because this makes debugging very hard indeed; that
is why <code>-s</code> is not passed to gcc by default.)

<p>A stripped "Hello world" program written in C should be about 42KB on
disk; an analogous program written in C<tt>++</tt> should be about 140KB on
disk (the additional overhead is due to the C<tt>++</tt> classes that are
linked in to support <code>cout</code>).

<p>C<tt>++</tt> programs could be further bloated because the release of
Binutils 2.8.1 was configured in a way that caused the assembler to put
into the symbol table local labels generated when compiling code that
uses exceptions.  Later uploads of GNU Binutils should solve this
problem, so consider upgrading to the latest <code>bnuNNNb.zip</code>.

<p>Some other compilers with which people keep comparing the size of DJGPP
programs use shared libraries or DLLs, so the size of the executable
doesn't include the libraries.  If you have an immediate question "Why
won't DJGPP use DLLs as well", read the following section.

<p>In general, judging code sizes by looking at the size of "Hello"
programs is meaningless, because such programs consist mostly of the
startup code.  The DJGPP startup code does many things in preparation
for running a protected-mode program in a Posix-compliant environment. 
This includes switching the processor to protected mode (which requires
a lot of code), wildcard expansion, long command-line support, and
loading the environment from a disk file; these usually aren't available
with other DOS compilers.  Exception and signal handling (not available
at all in v1.x), FPU detection and emulator loading (which were part of
<code>go32</code> in v1.x), are now also part of the startup code.

<p>Most of the power of all these features goes wasted in "Hello"
programs.  There is no point in running all that code just to print a
15-byte  string and exit.  However, the overhead induced by the code
needed to set up the DJGPP run-time environment is additive; the larger
the program, the smaller the overhead relative to the program size.  For
non-trivial programs, the code produced by DJGPP is usually smaller than
what other compilers produce.  For example, the DJGPP version of the
<code>Povray</code> program is smaller by about 200KB than the same program
compiled with the Watcom compiler.

<p>If your program doesn't need parts of the startup code, it can be made
smaller by defining certain functions with empty bodies.  These
functions are <code>__crt0_glob_function</code>,
<code>__crt0_load_environment_file</code>, and <code>__crt0_setup_arguments.</code>
If you define empty substitutes for all three of these, and compile with
<code>-O2 -s</code>, you can make the "Hello" program be 31KB on disk. 
These functions are documented in the DJGPP libc reference, which see. 
Here's an example of definitions for these functions that will make the
startup code as small as it gets<a rel=footnote href="faq25.html"><sup>15</sup></a>:

<pre>  #include &lt;crt0.h&gt;

  char **__crt0_glob_function (char *arg) { return 0; }
  void   __crt0_load_environment_file (char *progname) { }
  void   __crt0_setup_arguments (void) { }
</pre>

<p>(To do this in a C<tt>++</tt> program, prepend the <code>extern "C"</code>
qualifier to each one of the three lines that define the substitute
functions.)

<p>Note that if you define an empty substitute for
<code>__crt0_setup_arguments</code>, your program will not be able to access
its command-line arguments via the <code>argv[]</code> array.  So this is only
recommended for programs which don't accept any arguments at all.

<p>You can make your program image still smaller by compressing it with
a compressor called <a href="ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2misc/mlp107b.zip"><small>DJP</small></a>. <small>DJP</small> is
a DJGPP-specific executable file compressor.  It is fast and has no
memory overhead.  It also knows about DJGPP <dfn>Dynamically Loaded
Modules</dfn> (DLM) technology.  (Note that <small>DJP</small> before version 1.06 was
incompatible with Binutils 2.8.1 and later<a rel=footnote href="faq25.html"><sup>16</sup></a>, so
you should always use the latest <small>DJP</small> version available on
SimTel.NET mirrors.)

<p><small>DJP</small> is not actively developed anymore; its successor is the
<small>UPX</small> compressor, currently in beta testing.  <small>UPX</small> is written by
the same people who wrote <small>DJP</small>, compresses better, and supports a
broader class of executable formats, including DOS <code>.exe</code>,
<code>.com</code> and <code>.sys</code>, DJGPP's COFF, Watcom's LE, Win32 PE, and
Linux's ELF.  <small>UPX</small> is available <a href="http://wildsau.idv.uni-linz.ac.at/mfx/upx.html">via the Web</a>.
