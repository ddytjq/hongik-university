Some enzymes, such as bovine ribonuclease A, regain catalytic activity after removal of the denaturant.			<li>Other enzymes require protein factors to attain catalytically active conformations. These factors are required for:			<ul>				<li>catalytic activity of <a href="MG24.html">newly synthesized</a> polypeptide enzymes;				<li>regain of catalytic activity of denatured enzymes.			</ul>			<li>The factors include:			<ul>				<li>an enzyme catalyzing the exchange of cysteines between pairs of disulfide bonds;				<li>an enzyme catalyzing the <i>cis-trans</i> <a href="MG252.html">isomerization of proline</a>; and				<li><strong>Molecular chaperone</strong> proteins that bind incompletely folded or assembled proteins.				<ul>					<li>They are thought to function by binding to exposed hydrophobic areas of the polypeptides, thus preventing non-specific aggregation of incompletely folded proteins.					<li>An example of a molecular chaperone is BiP which was identified as binding free immunoglobulin heavy chains in the endoplasmic reticulum. In the presence of free light chains, the complete immunoglobulin is assembled:				</ul>			</ul>		</ul>		<center>			<p>2 H--BiP + 2 L ----&gt; H<sub>2</sub>L<sub>2</sub> + 2 BiP.</p>		</center>		<ul>			<li>Subtilisin is a bacterial protease.			<ul>				<li>Preprosubtilisin is the product of mRNA translation. It has two extra stretches of polypeptide at the N-terminus. The first, the presequence is removed during secretion of the polypeptide from the cell. The second, the prosequence is removed proteolytically to form the active subtilisin.				<li>Denatured subtilisin does not refold to the active enzyme on removal of the denaturant.				<li>In the presence of the prosequence, denatured subtilisin does refold to its active conformation (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Entrez/query?uid=2657436&form=6&db=m&Dopt=b">ref</a>).			</ul>			<li>During a rapid rise in temperature, the synthesis of several kinds of chaperonins, the heat shock proteins (HSP), is greatly elevated. The genes for these proteins contain a <a href="MG2229.html">transcription regulatory element</a>, the heat response element (HRE). The HRE is the target of the heat shock <a href="MG2220.html">transcription factor</a> (HSTF) which is normally bound in an inactive form by HSP70. Denaturation of proteins by heat leads to a release of HSTF, presumably by HSP70 binding to denatured proteins.		</ul>		<center>			<p>&nbsp;</p>			<p><a href="#Facts">Facts</a> | <a href="#Interp">Interpretations</a> | <a href="#Info">Further Info.</a> | <a href="#bottom">Other Pages</a></p>		</center>		<h4>Interpretations</h4>		<ul>			<li>Signals for the proper folding of polypeptides are contained within the polypeptide amino acid sequence.			<li>In some proteins, these signals are self-recognized so that no other proteins are needed for proper folding			<li>In other proteins, these signals probably also exist but require other proteins that assist in their folding by preventing inappropriate folding.			<li>For some proteins, such as subtilisin, synthesized as precursors, the peptide that is removed in maturation serves as a specific template for the organization of the remainder of the chain.			<li>That peptides can serve as templates for folding other proteins may be related to the conversion of the cellular form of <a href="../MGW1/MG11214.html">prion</a> proteins to the infectious form.		</ul>		<center>			<p><a name="Interp"></a><a href="#Facts">Facts</a> | <a href="#Interp">Interpretations</a> | <a href="#Info">Further Info.</a> | <a href="#bottom">Other Pages</a><br>			</p>		</center>		<h4><a name="Info"></a>Further information</h4>		<ul>			<li>Steps in protein folding are being investigated by biochemists and biophysicists. <img src="nav4.gif" width="69" height="71" align="right" usemap="#nav4B1F889C9"><map name=""></map> 			<li>These investigations should lead to a better identification of the signals important in folding (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=10098403&dopt=Abstract">ref</a>).			<li>Folding is one of several co- or post-translational <a href="MG25.html">modifications</a> of proteins.		</ul>		<center>			<p><a name="bottom"></a><a href="MG252.html">Last</a> | <a href="MG259.html">Vocabulary</a> | <a href="MG25.html">Overview</a> | <a href="#Facts">Top</a> | <a href="MG254.html">Next</a><br>			<br>			</p>		</center>		<p>		<hr>		</p>		<p>This is page 253 of <a href="../MG01.html">Molecular Genetics</a> by <a href="http://opbs.okstate.edu/~melcher/UM.html">Ulrich Melcher</a>, &copy; 1999<br>		<hr>		<img height="72" width="108" src="divlogo2.gif" align="right"></p>		<address>E-mail inquiries to <a href="mailto:umelcher@biochem.okstate.edu">U.
