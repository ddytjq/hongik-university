his FAQ discusses several instances where speciation has been
observed.  It also discusses several issues related to speciation.

<P>
	I have divided this FAQ into several sections.  Part 2
discusses several definitions of what a species is.  Part 3 explains
the context in which observations of speciation are made.  Part 4
looks at the question, "How can we tell when a speciation event has
occurred?"  Part 5 describes a number of observed speciation events
and several experiments which (IMO) failed to produce speciation.
Part 6 is a list of references.

<P>
	The descriptions of each observation come from the primary
literature.  I went back to this literature for two reasons.  First,
many of these observations are not discussed (or not discussed in
much detail) in secondary sources such as reviews, texts and popular
articles.  Second, it is difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate what
a piece of research actually established without looking at the methods
and data.  Secondary sources rarely give this information in any detail.
Anyway, I have included only those observations that I have been able
to find the original sources for.

<P>
	I consider this FAQ incomplete.  One reason for this is that I
am still chasing references (I still have a list of over 115 to find).
More important is the fact that observations of speciation are buried
in papers on a number of topics.  If you know of observations that I
should include, let me know and I will chase down the reference, read
it and modify the file (assuming that the data are the least bit
convincing).  I ask that you try to give me as complete a reference
as possible to aid me in finding the original source.

<P>
<B>1.1 Acknowledgements</B>

	Back in April of 1993, Rich Fox asked a series of questions
related to species and speciation events.  These questions got me
interested in the topic.  I hope that I have, at least, provided grist
for the mill that will grind out an answer to Rich's questions.  In any
case, Rich deserves the credit (or blame :-)) for inspiring me to write
this.  My starting point was the references contained in the old speciation
FAQ.  I wish to thank the authors of this, Chris Stassen, James Meritt,
Anneliese Lilje and L. Drew Davis.  Tom Scharle and Simon Clippingdale
sent a couple of references my way.  Finally, John Edstrom sent me
considerable information on symbiosis in Amoeba.  While I have not had
a chance to get all the references that he has sent me, he has given me
a great deal to think about over the role of symbiosis in speciation.
Many thanks to all.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>2.0 Species Definitions</FONT></B>

	A discussion of speciation requires a definition of what
constitutes a species.  This is a topic of considerable debate within
the biological community.  Three recent reviews in the Journal of
Phycology give some idea of the scope of the debate (Castenholz 1992,
Manhart and McCourt 1992, Wood and Leatham 1992).  There are a variety
of different species concept currently in use by biologists.  These
include folk, biological, morphological, genetic, paleontological,
evolutionary, phylogenetic and biosystematic definitions.  In the
interest of brevity, I'll only discuss four of these -- folk,
biological, morphological and phylogenetic.  A good review of species
definitions is given in Stuessy 1990.

<P>
<B>2.1 The Folk Concept of Species</B>

	Naturalists around the world have found that the individual
plants and animals they see can be mentally grouped into a number of
taxa, in which the individuals are basically alike.  In societies that
are close to nature, each taxon is given a name.  These sorts of folk
taxonomies have two features in common.  One aspect is the idea of
reproductive compatability and continuity within a species.  Dogs
beget dogs, they never beget cats!  This has a firm grounding in folk
knowledge.  The second notion is that there is a discontinuity of
variation between species.  In other words, you can tell species apart
by looking at them (Cronquist 1988).

<P>
<B>2.2 The Biological Species Concept</B>

	Over the last few decades the theoretically preeminent species
definition has been the biological species concept (BSC).  This concept
defines a species as a reproductive community.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=-1>2.2.1 History of the Biological Species Concept</FONT></B>

	The BSC has undergone a number of changes over the years.  The
earliest precursor that I could find was in Du Rietz 1930.  Du Rietz
defined a species as
<p><blockquote>
	"... the smallest natural populations permanently separated
	from each other by a distinct discontinuity in the series of
	biotypes."
</blockquote>

	Barriers to interbreeding are implicit in this definition and
explicit in Du Rietz's dicussion of it.

<P>
	A few years later, Dobzhansky defined a species as
<p><blockquote>
	"... that stage of evolutionary progress at which the once
	actually or potentially interbreeding array of forms becomes
	segregated into two or more separate arrays which are
	physiologically incapable of interbreeding." (Dobzhansky 1937)
</blockquote>
	It is important to note that this is a highly restrictive
definition of species.  It emphasizes experimental approaches and
ignores what goes on in nature.  By the publication of the third edition
of the book this appeared in, Dobzhansky (1951) had relaxed this
definition to the point that is substantially agreed with Mayr's.

<P>
	The definition of a species that is accepted as the BSC was
promulgated by Mayr (1942).  He defined species as
<P><blockquote>
	"... groups of actually or potentially interbreeding
	natural populations which are reproductively isolated from
	other such groups."
</blockquote>
	Note that the emphasis in this definition is on what happens
in nature.  Mayr later amended this definition to include an ecological
component.  In this form of the definition a species is
<p><blockquote>
	"... a reproductive community of populations (reproductively
	isolated from others) that occupies a specific niche in nature."
</blockquote>
	The BSC is most strongly accepted among vertebrate zoologists
and entomologists.  Two facts account for this.  First, these are the
groups that the authors of the BSC worked with :-). (Note: Mayr is
an ornithologist and Dobzhansky worked extensively with Drosophila).
More importantly, obligate sexuality is the predominant form of
reproduction in these groups.  It is not coincidental that the BSC
is less widely accepted among botanists.  Terrestrial plants exhibit
much greater diversity in their "mode of reproduction" than do
vertebrates and insects.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=-1>2.2.2 Criticisms of the Biological Species Concept</FONT></B>

	There has been considerable criticism of the theoretical
validity and practical utility of the BSC. (Cracraft 1989,
Donoghue 1985, Levin 1979, Mishler and Donoghue 1985, Sokal and
Crovello 1970).

<P>
	The application of the BSC to a number of groups, including
land plants, is problematical because of interspecific hybridization
between clearly delimited species (McCourt and Hoshaw 1990, Mishler 1985).

<P>
	There is an abundance of asexual populations that this
definition just doesn't apply to (Budd and Mishler 1990).  Examples of
taxa which are obligately asexual include bdelloid rotifers, euglenoid
flagellates, some members of the Oocystaceae (coccoid green algae),
chloromonad flagellates and some araphid pennate diatoms.  Asexual
forms of normally sexual organisms are known.  Obligately asexual
populations of Daphnia are found in some arctic lakes.  The BSD can
be of no help in delimiting species in these groups.  A similar situation
is found in the prokaryotes.  Though genes can be exchanged among
bacteria by a number of mechanisms, sexuality, as defined in eukaryotes,
in unknown in the prokaryotes.  One popular microbiology text doesn't
even mention the BSC (Brock and Madigan 1988).

<P>
	The applicability of the BSC is also questionable in those
land plants that primarily self-pollinate (Cronquist 1988).

<P>
	A more serious criticism is that the BSC is inapplicable in
practice.  This charge asserts that, in most cases, the BSC cannot be
practically applied to delimit species.  The BSC suggests breeding
experiments as the test of species membership.  But this is a test
that is rarely made.  The number of crosses needed to delimit
membership in a species can be astronomical.  The following example
will illustrate the problem.

<P>
	Here in Wisconsin we have about 16,000 lakes and ponds.  A
common (and tasty ;-)) inhabitant of many of these bodies of water is
the bluegill sunfish.  Let's ask a question -- do all these bluegill
populations constitute one species or several morphologically similar
species?  Assume that only 1,000 of these lakes and ponds contain
bluegills.  Assuming that each lake constitutes a population, an
investigator would have to perform 499,500 separate crosses to
determine whether the populations could interbreed.  But to do this
right we should really do reciprocal crosses (i.e. cross a male from
population A with a female from population B and a male from population
B with a female from population A).  This brings the total crosses we
need to make up to 999,000.  But don't we also need to make replicates?
Having three replicates brings the total to 2,997,000 crosses.  In
addition, you just can't put a pair of bluegills into a bucket and
expect them to mate.  In nature, male bluegills excavate and defend
nests in large mating colonies.  After the nests are excavated the
females come in to the colony to spawn.  Here the females choose among
potential mates.  This means that we would need to simulate a colony
in our test.  Assume that 20 fish would be sufficient for a single test.
We find that we would need about 60,000,000 fish to test whether all these
populations are members of the same species!  (We would also need a large
number of large aquaria to run these crosses in).  But bluegills are not
restricted to Wisconsin...

<P>
	I could go on, but I think the point is now obvious.  The fact
of the matter is that the time, effort and money needed to delimit
species using the BSC is, to say the least, prohibitive.

<P>
	Another reason why using the BSC to delimit species is
impractical is that breeding experiments can often be inconclusive.
Interbreeding in nature can be heavily influenced by variable and
unstable environmental factors.  (Any angler who has waited for the
bluegills to get on to the beds can confirm this one).  If we can't
duplicate natural conditions of breeding, a failure to breed doesn't
mean that the critters can't (or don't) interbreed in the wild.  The
difficulties that were encountered in breeding pandas in captivity
illustrate this.  In addition, experimentally showing that A doesn't
interbreed with B doesn't preclude both interbreeding with C.  This
gets even more complicated in groups that don't have nice,
straightforward sexes.  An example of this occurs in a number of
protozoan species.  These critters have numerous mating types.  There
can be very complicated compatability of mating types.  Finally,
breeding experiments can be inconclusive because actual interbreeding
and gene flow among phenetically similar, genetically compatible local
populations is often more restricted than the BSC would suggest
(Cronquist 1988).

<P>
	In practice, even strong adherents of the BSC use phenetic
similarities and discontinuities for delimiting species.  If the
organisms are phenotypically similar, they are considered
conspecific until a reproductive barrier is demonstrated.

<P>
	Another criticism of the BSC comes from the cladistic school
of taxonomy (e.g. Donoghue 1985).  The cladists argue that sexual
compatibility is a primitive trait.  Organisms that are no longer
closely related may have retained the ability for genetic recombination
with each other through sex.  This is not a derived characteristic.
Because of this it is invalid for defining monophyletic taxa.

<P>
	A final problem with the BSC is that groups that do not
occur together in time cannot be evaluated.  We simply cannot know
whether two such groups would interbreed freely if they came together
under natural conditions.  This makes it impossible to delimit the
boundaries of extinct groups using the BSC.  One question will
illustrate the problem.  Do Homo erectus and Homo sapiens represent
the same or different species?  This question is unresolvable using
the biological definition.

<P>
	Several alternatives to the biological species concept have
been suggested.  I will discuss two.

<P>
<B>2.3 The Phenetic (or Morphological) Species Concept</B>

	Cronquist (1988) proposed an alternative to the BSC that he
called a "renewed practical species definition".  He defines species
as
<p><blockquote>
	"... the smallest groups that are consistently and persistently
	distinct and distinguishable by ordinary means."
</blockquote>
	Three comments must be made about this definition.  First,
"ordinary means" includes any techniques that are widely available,
cheap and relatively easy to apply.  These means will differ among
different groups of organisms.  For example, to a botanist working
with angiosperms ordinary means might mean a hand lens; to an
entomologist working with beetles it might mean a dissecting microscope;
to a phycologist working with diatoms it might mean a scanning electron
microscope.  What means are ordinary are determined by what is needed to
examine the organisms in question.

<P>
	Second, the requirement that species be persistently distinct
implies a certain degree of reproductive continuity.  This is because
phenetic discontinuity between groups cannot persist in the absence of
a barrier to interbreeding.

<P>
	Third, this definition places a heavy, though not exclusive,
emphasis on morphological characters.  It also recognizes phenetic
characters such as chromosome number, chromosome morphology, cell
ultrastructure, secondary metabolites, habitats and other features.

<P>
<B>2.4 Phylogenetic Species Concepts</B>

	There are several phylogenetic species definitions.  All of
them assert that classifications should reflect the best supported
hypotheses of the phylogeny of the organisms.  Baum (1992) describes
two types of phylogenetic species concepts.

<P>
	(1) A species is the smallest cluster of organisms that
possesses at least one diagnostic character.  This character may be
morphological, biochemical or molecular and must be fixed in
reproductively cohesive units.  It is important to realize that this
reproductive continuity is not used in the same way as in the BSC.
Phylogenetic species may be reproductive communities.  Reproductively
compatible individuals need not have the diagnostic character of a
species.  In this case, the individuals need not be conspecific.

<P>
	(2) A species must be monophyletic and share one or more
derived character.  There are two meanings to monophyletic
(de Queiroz and Donoghue 1988, Nelson 1989).  The first defines a
monophyletic group as all the descendants of a common ancestor and
the ancestor.  The second defines a monophyletic group as a group
of organisms that are more closely related to each other than to any
other organisms.  These distinctions are discussed in Baum 1992 and
de Queiroz and Donoghue 1990.

<P>
	A recently offered hypothesis suggests that phylogenetic
species concepts and the biological species concept may be highly,
if not completely, incompatible.  "Parallel speciation " has been
defined as the repeated independent evolution of the same reproduc-
tive isolating mechanism (Schluter and Nagel 1995).  An example of
this may occur when a species colonizes several new areas which are
isolated from, but environmentally similar to, each other.  Similar
selective pressures in these environments result in parallel evolu-
tion among the traits that confer reproductive isolation.  There is
some experimental evidence that this might occur (Kilias, et al.
1980; Dodd 1989).  The implication of this is that biological species
(as defined by the BSC) may often be polyphyletic.  If this occurs in
nature, it could undermine the usefulness of phylogenetic species
concepts.

<P>
<B>2.5 Why This is Included </B>

	What is all of this doing in a discussion of observed instances
of speciation?  What a biologist will consider as a speciation event
is, in part, dependent on which species definition that biologist
accepts.  The biological species concept has been very successful as a
theoretical model for explaining species differences among vertebrates
and some groups of arthropods.  This can lead us to glibly assert its
universal applicability, despite its irrelevance to many groups.  When
we examine putative speciation events, we need to ask the question, which
species definition is the most reasonable for this group of organisms?
In many cases it will be the biological definition.  In many other cases
some other definition will be more appropriate.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>3.0 The Context of Reports of Observed Speciations</FONT></B>

	The literature on observed speciations events is not well
organized.  I found only a few papers that had an observation of a
speciation event as the author's main point (e.g. Weinberg, et al. 1992).
In addition, I found only one review that was specifically on this topic
(Callaghan 1987).  This review cited only four examples of speciation
events.  Why is there such a seeming lack of interest in reporting
observations of speciation events?

<P>
	IMHO, four things account for this lack of interest.  First,
it appears that the biological community considers this a settled question.
Many researchers feel that there are already ample reports in the literature.
Few of these folks have actually looked closely.  To test this idea, I
asked about two dozen graduate students and faculty members in the department
where I'm a student whether there were examples where speciation had been
observed in the literature.  Everyone said that they were sure that there
were.  Next I asked them for citings or descriptions.  Only eight of the
people I talked to could give an example, only three could give more than
one.  But everyone was sure that there were papers in the literature.

<P>
	Second, most biologists accept the idea that speciation takes
a long time (relative to human life spans).  Because of this we would not
expect to see many speciation events actually occur.  The literature has
many more examples where a speciation event has been inferred from evidence
than it has examples where the event is seen.  This is what we would expect
if speciation takes a long time.

<P>
	Third, the literature contains many instances where a speciation
event has been inferred.  The number and quality of these cases may be
evidence enough to convince most workers that speciation does occur.

<P>
	Finally, most of the current interest in speciation concerns
theoretical issues.  Most biologists are convinced that speciation
occurs.  What they want to know is how it occurs.  One recent book on
speciation (Otte and Endler 1989) has few example of observed speciation,
but a lot of discussion of theory and mechanisms.

<P>
	Most of the reports, especially the recent reports, can be found
in papers that describe experimental tests of hypotheses related to
speciation.  Usually these experiments focus on questions related to
mechanisms of speciation.  Examples of these questions include:
<UL>
	<LI>Does speciation precede or follow adaptation to local
	   ecological conditions?
	<LI>Is speciation a by-product of genetic divergence among
	   populations or does it occur directly by natural selection
	   through lower fitness of hybrids?
	<LI>How quickly does speciation occur?
	<LI>What roles do bottlenecks and genetic drift play in
	   speciation?
	<LI>Can speciation occur sympatrically (i.e. can two or more
	   lineages diverge while they are intermingled in the same
	   place) or must the populations be separated in space or
	   time?
	<LI>What roles do pleiotropy and genetic hitchhiking play in
	   speciation?
</UL>

<P>
	It is important to note that a common theme running through
these questions is that they all attempt to address the issue of how
speciation occurs.
<P>


<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>4.0 Telling Whether a Speciation Event Has Occurred</FONT></B>

	What evidence is necessary to show that a change produced
in a population of organisms constitutes a speciation event?  The
answer to this question will depend on which species definition applies
to the organisms involved.

<P>
<B>4.1 Cases Where the Biological Species Concept Applies</B>

	One advantage of the BSC is that it provides a reasonably
unambiguous test that can be applied to possible speciation events.
Recall that under the BSC species are defined as being reproductively
isolated from other species.  Demonstrating that a population is
reproductively isolated (in a nontrivial way) from populations that it
was formerly able to interbreed with shows that speciation has occurred.
In practice, it is also necessary to show that at least one isolating
mechanism with a hereditary basis is present.  After all, just because a
pair of critters don't breed during an experiment doesn't mean they can't
breed or even that they won't breed.  Debates about whether a speciation
event has occurred often turn on whether isolating mechanisms have been
produced.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=-1>4.1.1 Isolating Mechanisms</FONT></B>

	Mechanisms which produce reproductive isolation fall into
two broad categories -- premating mechanisms and postmating mechanisms.

<P>
	Premating isolating mechanisms operate to keep species separate
before mating occurs.  Often they act to prevent mating altogether.
Examples of premating mechanisms include ecological, temporal, behavioral
and mechanical mechanisms.

<P>
	Ecological isolation occurs when species occupy or breed in
different habitats.  It is important to be careful when claiming
ecological isolation.  For example, I have a population of Dinobryon
cylindricum (a colonial algal flagellate) growing in a culture tube in
an environmental chamber.  It's been there for three years (which is a
lot of time in flagellate years! :-)).  Even though there is no
possibility that they will mate with the D. cylindricum in Lake Michigan,
it would be silly to assert that they therefore constitute a separate species.
Physical isolation alone does not constitute an isolating mechanism with
an hereditary basis.

<P>
	Temporal isolation occurs when species breed at different times.
This may be different times of the year or different times of day.

<P>
	Behavioral isolating mechanisms rely on organisms making a
choice of whether to mate and a choice of who to mate with.  Differences
in courtship behavior, for instance, may be sufficient to prevent mating
from occurring.  A behavioral isolating mechanism should result in some
sort of positive assortative mating.  Simply put, positive assortative
mating occurs when organisms that differ in some way tend to mate with
organism that are like themselves.  For example, if blonds mate exclusively
with blonds, brunettes mate exclusively with brunettes, redheads mate
exclusively with redheads (and those of us without much hair don't get
to mate :-() the human population would exhibit a high degree of
positive assortative mating.  In most examples in the literature when
positive assortative mating is seen it is not this strong.  Positive
assortative mating is especially important in discussions of sympatric
speciation.

<P>
	Mechanical isolating mechanisms occur when morphological or
physiological differences prevent normal mating.

<P>
	Postmating isolating mechanisms prevent hybrid offspring from
developing or breeding when mating does occur. There are also several
examples of postmating mechanisms.

<P>
	Mechanical postmating isolating mechanisms occur in those
cases where mating is possible, but the gametes are unable to reach
each other or to fuse.  Mortality acts as an isolating mechanism when
the hybrid dies prior to maturity.  Sterility of hybrids can act as an
isolating mechanism.  Finally a reduction in the fitness of the hybrid
offspring can isolate two populations.  This happens when the F1 hybrid
is fertile but the F2 hybrid has lower fitness than either of the
parental species.

<P>
<B>4.2 Cases Where the Biological Species Concept Does Not Apply</B>

	There is no unambiguous criterion for determining that a
speciation event has occurred in those cases where the BSC does not
apply.  This is especially true for obligately asexual organisms.
Usually phenetic (e.g. phenotypic and genetic) differences between
populations are used to justify a claim of speciation.  A few caveats
are germane to this.  It is not obvious how much change is necessary to
claim that a population has speciated.  IMHO, the difference between the
"new species" and its "ancestor" should be at least as great as the
differences among recognized species in the group (i.e. genus, family)
involved.  The investigator should show that the change is persistent.
Finally, many organisms have life cycles/life histories that involve
alternative morphologies and/or an ability to adjust their phenotypes
in response to short term changes in ecological conditions.  The
investigator should be sure to rule these things out before claiming
that a phenetic change constitutes a speciation event.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>5.0 Observed Instances of Speciation</FONT></B>

	The following are several examples of observations of speciation.

<P>
<B>5.1 Speciations Involving Polyploidy, Hybridization or Hybridization
    Followed by Polyploidization.</B>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=-1>5.1.1 Plants</FONT></B>

	(See also the discussion in de Wet 1971).

<H5>5.1.1.1 Evening Primrose (Oenothera gigas)</H5>

	While studying the genetics of the evening primrose, Oenothera
lamarckiana, de Vries (1905) found an unusual variant among his plants.
O. lamarckiana has a chromosome number of 2N = 14.  The variant had a
chromosome number of 2N = 28.  He found that he was unable to breed
this variant with O. lamarckiana.  He named this new species O. gigas.

<H5>5.1.1.2 Kew Primrose (Primula kewensis)</H5>

	Digby (1912) crossed the primrose species Primula verticillata
and P. floribunda to produce a sterile hybrid.  Polyploidization occurred
in a few of these plants to produce fertile offspring.  The new species
was named P. kewensis.  Newton and Pellew (1929) note that spontaneous
hybrids of P. verticillata and P. floribunda set tetraploid seed on at
least three occasions.  These happened in 1905, 1923 and 1926.

<H5>5.1.1.3 Trapopogonan</H5>

	Owenby (1950) demonstrated that two species in this genus were
produced by polyploidization from hybrids.  He showed that Tragopogon
miscellus found in a colony in Moscow, Idaho was produced by hybridization
of T. dubius and T. pratensis.  He also showed that T. mirus found in a
colony near Pullman, Washington was produced by hybridization of T. dubius
and T. porrifolius.  Evidence from chloroplast DNA suggests that T. mirus
has originated independently by hybridization in eastern Washington and
western Idaho at least three times (Soltis and Soltis 1989).  The same
study also shows multiple origins for T. micellus.

<H5>5.1.1.4 Raphanobrassica</H5>

	The Russian cytologist Karpchenko (1927, 1928) crossed the
radish, Raphanus sativus, with the cabbage, Brassica oleracea.  Despite
the fact that the plants were in different genera, he got a sterile hybrid.
Some unreduced gametes were formed in the hybrids.  This allowed for the
production of seed.  Plants grown from the seeds were interfertile with
each other.  They were not interfertile with either parental species.
Unfortunately the new plant (genus Raphanobrassica) had the foliage
of a radish and the root of a cabbage.

<H5>5.1.1.5 Hemp Nettle (Galeopsis tetrahit)</H5>

	A species of hemp nettle, Galeopsis tetrahit, was hypothesized
to be the result of a natural hybridization of two other species, G.
pubescens and G. speciosa (Muntzing 1932).  The two species were crossed.
The hybrids matched G. tetrahit in both visible features and chromosome
morphology.

<P>
<H5>5.1.1.6 Madia citrigracilis</H5>

	Along similar lines, Clausen et al. (1945) hypothesized that
Madia citrigracilis was a hexaploid hybrid of M. gracilis and
M. citriodora  As evidence they noted that the species have gametic
chromosome numbers of n = 24, 16 and 8 respectively.  Crossing
M. gracilis and M. citriodora resulted in a highly sterile triploid
with n = 24.  The chromosomes formed almost no bivalents during
meiosis.  Artificially doubling the chromosome number using
colchecine produced a hexaploid hybrid which closely resembled
M. citrigracilis and was fertile.

<H5>5.1.1.7 Brassica</H5>

	Frandsen (1943, 1947) was able to do this same sort of
recreation of species in the genus Brassica (cabbage, etc.).  His
experiments showed that B. carinata (n = 17) may be recreated by
hybridizing  B. nigra (n = 8) and B. oleracea, B. juncea (n = 18) may
be recreated by hybridizing B. nigra and B. campestris (n = 10), and
B. napus (n = 19) may be recreated by hybridizing B. oleracea and
B. campestris.

<H5>5.1.1.8 Maidenhair Fern (Adiantum pedatum)</H5>

	Rabe and Haufler (1992) found a naturally occurring diploid
sporophyte of maidenhair fern which produced unreduced (2N) spores.
These spores resulted from a failure of the paired chromosomes to
dissociate during the first division of meiosis.  The spores germinated
normally and grew into diploid gametophytes.  These did not appear to
produce antheridia.  Nonetheless, a subsequent generation of tetraploid
sporophytes was produced.  When grown in the lab, the tetraploid
sporophytes appear to be less vigorous than the normal diploid sporo-
phytes.  The 4N individuals were found near Baldwin City, Kansas.

<P>
<H5>5.1.1.9 Woodsia Fern (Woodsia abbeae)</H5>

	Woodsia abbeae was described as a hybrid of W. cathcariana
and W. ilvensis (Butters 1941).  Plants of this hybrid normally
produce abortive sporangia containing inviable spores.  In 1944
Butters found a W. abbeae plant near Grand Portage, Minn. that had
one fertile frond (Butters and Tryon 1948).  The apical portion of
this frond had fertile sporangia.  Spores from this frond germinated
and grew into prothallia.  About six months after germination
sporophytes were produced.  They survived for about one year.  Based
on cytological evidence, Butters and Tryon concluded that the frond
that produced the viable spores had gone tetraploid.  They made no
statement as to whether the sporophytes grown produced viable spores.

	Speciation through hybridization and/or polyploidy has
long been considered much less important in animals than in
plants [[[refs.]]].  A number of reviews suggest that this view
may be mistaken.   (Lokki and Saura 1980; Bullini and Nascetti 1990;
Vrijenhoek 1994).  Bullini and Nasceti (1990) review chromosomal and
genetic evidence that suggest that speciation through hybridization
may occur in a number of insect species, including walking sticks,
grasshoppers, blackflies and cucurlionid beetles.  Lokki and Saura
(1980) discuss the role of polyploidy in insect evolution.
Vrijenhoek (1994) reviews the literature on parthenogenesis and
hybridogenesis in fish.  I will tackle this topic in greater depth in

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=-1>5.2.1 Stephanomeira malheurensis</FONT></B>

	Gottlieb (1973) documented the speciation of Stephanomeira
malheurensis.  He found a single small population (< 250 plants)
among a much larger population (> 25,000 plants) of S. exigua in
Harney Co., Oregon.  Both species are diploid and have the same number
of chromosomes (N = 8).  S. exigua is an obligate outcrosser exhibiting
sporophytic self-incompatibility.  S. malheurensis exhibits no self-
incompatibility and self-pollinates.  Though the two species look very
similar, Gottlieb was able to document morphological differences in five
characters plus chromosomal differences.  F1 hybrids between the species
produces only 50% of the seeds and 24% of the pollen that conspecific
crosses produced.  F2 hybrids showed various developmental abnormalities.

<B><FONT SIZE=-1>5.2.2 Maize (Zea mays)</FONT></B>

	Pasterniani (1969) produced almost complete reproductive
isolation between two varieties of maize.  The varieties were
distinguishable by seed color, white versus yellow.  Other genetic
markers allowed him to identify hybrids.  The two varieties were
planted in a common field.  Any plant's nearest neighbors were always
plants of the other strain.  Selection was applied against hybridization
by using only those ears of corn that showed a low degree of hybridi-
zation as the source of the next years seed.  Only parental type kernels
from these ears were planted.  The strength of selection was increased
each year.  In the first year, only ears with less than 30% intercrossed
seed were used.  In the fifth year, only ears with less than 1%
intercrossed seed were used.  After five years the average percentage
of intercrossed matings dropped from 35.8% to 4.9% in the white strain
and from 46.7% to 3.4% in the yellow strain.

<B><FONT SIZE=-1>5.2.3 Speciation as a Result of Selection for Tolerance to a Toxin:
      Yellow Monkey Flower (Mimulus guttatus)</FONT></B>

	At reasonably low concentrations, copper is toxic to many plant
species.  Several plants have been seen to develop a tolerance to this
metal (Macnair 1981).  Macnair and Christie (1983) used this to examine
the genetic basis of a postmating isolating mechanism in yellow monkey
flower.  When they crossed plants from the copper tolerant "Copperopolis"
population with plants from the nontolerant "Cerig" population, they
found that many of the hybrids were inviable.  During early growth,
just after the four leaf stage, the leaves of many of the hybrids
turned yellow and became necrotic.  Death followed this.  This was
seen only in hybrids between the two populations.  Through mapping
studies, the authors were able to show that the copper tolerance gene
and the gene responsible for hybrid inviability were either the same
gene or were very tightly linked.  These results suggest that
reproductive isolation may require changes in only a small number of
genes.

	Dobzhansky and Pavlovsky (1971) reported a speciation event that
occurred in a laboratory culture of Drosophila paulistorum sometime
between 1958 and 1963.  The culture was descended from a single inseminated
female that was captured in the Llanos of Colombia.  In 1958 this strain
produced fertile hybrids when crossed with conspecifics of different
strains from Orinocan.  From 1963 onward crosses with Orinocan strains
produced only sterile males.  Initially no assortative mating or
behavioral isolation was seen between the Llanos strain and the Orinocan
strains.  Later on Dobzhansky produced assortative mating (Dobzhansky 1972).

<B><FONT SIZE=-1>5.3.2 Disruptive Selection on Drosophila melanogaster</FONT></B>

	Thoday and Gibson (1962) established a population of Drosophila
melanogaster from four gravid females.  They applied selection on this
population for flies with the highest and lowest numbers of sternoplural
chaetae (hairs).  In each generation, eight flies with high numbers of
chaetae were allowed to interbreed and eight flies with low numbers of
chaetae were allowed to interbreed.  Periodically they performed mate
choice experiments on the two lines.  They found that they had produced a
high degree of positive assortative mating between the two groups.  In
the decade or so following this, eighteen labs attempted unsuccessfully
to reproduce these results.  References are given in Thoday and Gibson 1970.

<B><FONT SIZE=-1>5.3.3 Selection on Courtship Behavior in Drosophila melanogaster</FONT></B>

	Crossley (1974) was able to produce changes in mating behavior
in two mutant strains of D. melanogaster.  Four treatments were used.
In each treatment, 55 virgin males and 55 virgin females of both ebony
body mutant flies and vestigial wing mutant flies (220 flies total) were
put into a jar and allowed to mate for 20 hours.  The females were collected
and each was put into a separate vial.  The phenotypes of the offspring
were recorded.  Wild type offspring were hybrids between the mutants.
In two of the four treatments, mating was carried out in the light.  In
one of these treatments all hybrid offspring were destroyed.  This was
repeated for 40 generations.  Mating was carried out in the dark in the
other two treatments.  Again, in one of these all hybrids were destroyed.
This was repeated for 49 generations.  Crossley ran mate choice tests and
observed mating behavior.  Positive assortative mating was found in the
treatment which had mated in the light and had been subject to strong
selection against hybridization.  The basis of this was changes in the
courtship behaviors of both sexes.  Similar experiments, without observation
of mating behavior, were performed by Knight, et al. (1956).

	Kilias, et al. (1980) exposed D. melanogaster populations to
different temperature and humidity regimes for several years.  They
performed mating tests to check for reproductive isolation.  They found
some sterility in crosses among populations raised under different
conditions.  They also showed some positive assortative mating.  These
things were not observed in populations which were separated but raised
under the same conditions.  They concluded that sexual isolation was
produced as a byproduct of selection.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=-1>5.3.5 Sympatric Speciation in Drosophila melanogaster</FONT></B>

	In a series of papers (Rice 1985, Rice and Salt 1988 and Rice
and Salt 1990) Rice and Salt presented experimental evidence for the
possibility of sympatric speciation.  They started from the premise that
whenever organisms sort themselves into the environment first and then mate
locally, individuals with the same habitat preferences will necessarily mate
assortatively.  They established a stock population of D. melanogaster with
flies collected in an orchard near Davis, California.  Pupae from the culture
were placed into a habitat maze.  Newly emerged flies had to negotiate the
maze to find food.  The maze simulated several environmental gradients
simultaneously.  The flies had to make three choices of which way to go.
The first was between light and dark (phototaxis).  The second was between
up and down (geotaxis).  The last was between the scent of acetaldehyde and
the scent of ethanol (chemotaxis).  This divided the flies among eight
habitats.  The flies were further divided by the time of day of emergence.
In total the flies were divided among 24 spatio-temporal habitats.

<P>
	They next cultured two strains of flies that had chosen opposite
habitats.  One strain emerged early, flew upward and was attracted to
dark and acetaldehyde.  The other emerged late, flew downward and was
attracted to light and ethanol.  Pupae from these two strains were placed
together in the maze.  They were allowed to mate at the food site and
were collected.  Eye color differences between the strains allowed Rice and
Salt to distinguish between the two strains.  A selective penalty was
imposed on flies that switched habitats.  Females that switched habitats
were destroyed.  None of their gametes passed into the next generation.
Males that switched habitats received no penalty.  After 25 generations
of this mating tests showed reproductive isolation between the two strains.
Habitat specialization was also produced.

<P>
	They next repeated the experiment without the penalty against
habitat switching.  The result was the same -- reproductive isolation
was produced.  They argued that a switching penalty is not necessary
to produce reproductive isolation.  Their results, they stated, show the
possibility of sympatric speciation.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=-1>5.3.6 Isolation Produced as an Incidental Effect of Selection on
      several Drosophila species</FONT></B>

	In a series of experiments, del Solar (1966) derived positively
and negatively geotactic and phototactic strains of D. pseudoobscura
from the same population by running the flies through mazes.  Flies from
different strains were then introduced into mating chambers (10 males and
10 females from each strain).  Matings were recorded.  Statistically
significant positive assortative mating was found.

<P>
	In a separate series of experiments Dodd (1989) raised eight
populations derived from a single population of D. Pseudoobscura on
stressful media.  Four populations were raised on a starch based medium,
the other four were raised on a maltose based medium.  The fly
populations in both treatments took several months to get established,
implying that they were under strong selection.  Dodd found some
evidence of genetic divergence between flies in the two treatments.
He performed mate choice tests among experimental populations.  He
found statistically significant assortative mating between populations
raised on different media, but no assortative mating among populations
raised within the same medium regime.  He argued that since there was
no direct selection for reproductive isolation, the behavioral isolation
results from a pleiotropic by-product to adaptation to the two media.
Schluter and Nagel (1995) have argued that these results provide
experimental support for the hypothesis of parallel speciation.

<P>
	Less dramatic results were obtained by growing D.
willistoni on media of different pH levels (de Oliveira and Cordeiro
1980).  Mate choice tests after 26, 32, 52 and 69 generations of
growth showed statistically significant assortative mating between
some populations grown in different pH treatments.  This ethological
isolation did not always persist over time.  They also found that
some crosses made after 106 and 122 generations showed significant
hybrid inferiority, but only when grown in acid medium.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=-1>5.3.7 Selection for Reinforcement in Drosophila melanogaster</FONT></B>

	Some proposed models of speciation rely on a process called
reinforcement to complete the speciation process.  Reinforcement
occurs when to partially isolated allopatric populations come into
contact.  Lower relative fitness of hybrids between the two populations
results in increased selection for isolating mechanisms.  I should
note that a recent review (Rice and Hostert 1993) argues that there
is little experimental evidence to support reinforcement models.  Two
experiments in which the authors argue that their results provide
support are discussed below.

<P>
	Ehrman (1971) established strains of wild-type and mutant
(black body) D. melanogaster.  These flies were derived from compound
autosome strains such that heterotypic matings would produce no
progeny.  The two strains were reared together in common fly cages.
After two years, the isolation index generated from mate choice
experiments had increased from 0.04 to 0.43, indicating the appearance
of considerable assortative mating.  After four years this index had
risen to 0.64 (Ehrman 1973).

<P>
	Along the same lines, Koopman (1950) was able to increase the
degree of reproductive isolation between two partially isolated species,
D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=-1>5.3.8 Tests of the Founder-flush Speciation Hypothesis Using
	Drosophila</FONT></B>

	The founder-flush (a.k.a. flush-crash) hypothesis posits that
genetic drift and founder effects play a major role in speciation (Powell
1978).  During a founder-flush cycle a new habitat is colonized by a
small number of individuals (e.g. one inseminated female).  The population
rapidly expands (the flush phase). This is followed by the population
crashing.  During this crash period the population experiences strong
genetic drift.  The population undergoes another rapid expansion followed
by another crash.  This cycle repeats several times.  Reproductive isolation
is produced as a byproduct of genetic drift.

<P>
	Dodd and Powell (1985) tested this hypothesis using D. pseudoobscura.
A large, heterogeneous population was allowed to grow rapidly in a very
large population cage.  Twelve experimental populations were derived from
this population from single pair matings.  These populations were allowed to
flush.  Fourteen months later, mating tests were performed among the twelve
populations.  No postmating isolation was seen.  One cross showed strong
behavioral isolation.  The populations underwent three more flush-crash
cycles.  Forty-four months after the start of the experiment (and fifteen
months after the last flush) the populations were again tested.  Once
again, no postmating isolation was seen.  Three populations showed
behavioral isolation in the form of positive assortative mating.  Later
tests between 1980 and 1984 showed that the isolation persisted, though it
was weaker in some cases.

<P>
	Galina, et al. (1993) performed similar experiments with D.
pseudoobscura.  Mating tests between populations that underwent flush-crash
cycles and their ancestral populations showed 8 cases of positive assortative
mating out of 118 crosses.  They also showed 5 cases of negative assortative
mating (i.e. the flies preferred to mate with flies of the other strain).
Tests among the founder-flush populations showed 36 cases of positive
assortative mating out of 370 crosses.  These tests also found 4 cases
of negative assortative mating.  Most of these mating preferences did not
persist over time.  Galina, et al. concluded that the founder-flush
protocol yields reproductive isolation only as a rare and erratic event.

<P>
	Ahearn (1980) applied the founder-flush protocol to D. silvestris.
Flies from a line of this species underwent several flush-crash cycles.
They were tested in mate choice experiments against flies from a continuously
large population.  Female flies from both strains preferred to mate with
males from the large population.  Females from the large population
would not mate with males from the founder flush population.  An
asymmetric reproductive isolation was produced.

<P>
	In a three year experiment, Ringo, et al. (1985) compared the
effects of a founder-flush protocol to the effects of selection on various
traits.  A large population of D. simulans was created from flies from
69 wild caught stocks from several locations.  Founder-flush lines and
selection lines were derived from this population.  The founder-flush
lines went through six flush-crash cycles.  The selection lines experienced
equal intensities of selection for various traits.  Mating test were
performed between strains within a treatment and between treatment strains
and the source population.  Crosses were also checked for postmating
isolation.  In the selection lines, 10 out of 216 crosses showed
positive assortative mating (2 crosses showed negative assortative mating).
They also found that 25 out of 216 crosses showed postmating isolation.
Of these, 9 cases involved crosses with the source population.  In the
founder-flush lines 12 out of 216 crosses showed positive assortative
mating (3 crosses showed negative assortative mating).  Postmating isolation
was found in 15 out of 216 crosses, 11 involving the source population.
They concluded that only weak isolation was found and that there was little
difference between the effects of natural selection and the effects of
genetic drift.

<B><FONT SIZE=-1>5.4.1 A Test of the Founder-flush Hypothesis Using Houseflies</FONT></B>

	Meffert and Bryant (1991) used houseflies to test whether
bottlenecks in populations can cause permanent alterations in courtship
behavior that lead to premating isolation.  They collected over 100
flies of each sex from a landfill near Alvin, Texas.  These were used to
initiate an ancestral population. From this ancestral population they
established six lines.  Two of these lines were started with one pair of
flies, two lines were started with four pairs of flies and two lines were
started with sixteen pairs of flies.  These populations were flushed to
about 2,000 flies each.  They then went through five bottlenecks followed
by flushes.  This took 35 generations.  Mate choice tests were performed.
One case of positive assortative mating was found.  One case of negative
assortative mating was also found.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=-1>5.4.2 Selection for Geotaxis with and without Gene Flow</FONT></B>

	Soans, et al. (1974) used houseflies to test Pimentel's
model of speciation.  This model posits that speciation requires two
steps.  The first is the formation of races in subpopulations.  This
is followed by the establishment of reproductive isolation.  Houseflies
were subjected to intense divergent selection on the basis of positive and
negative geotaxis.  In some treatments no gene flow was allowed, while in
others there was 30% gene flow.  Selection was imposed by placing 1000
flies into the center of a 108 cm vertical tube.  The first 50 flies that
reached the top and the first 50 flies that reached the bottom were used
to found positively and negatively geotactic populations.  Four populations
were established:

<p><blockquote>
  	Pop A  + geotaxis, no gene flow<br>
  	Pop B  - geotaxis, no gene flow<br>
  	Pop C  + geotaxis, 30% gene flow<br>
  	Pop D  - geotaxis, 30% gene flow<br>
</blockquote>

Selection was repeated within these populations each generations.  After
38 generations the time to collect 50 flies had dropped from 6 hours to
2 hours in Pop A, from 4 hours to 4 minutes in Pop B, from 6 hours to 2
hours in Pop C and from 4 hours to 45 minutes in Pop D.  Mate choice tests
were performed.  Positive assortative mating was found in all crosses.
They concluded that reproductive isolation occurred under both allopatric
and sympatric conditions when very strong selection was present.

<P>
	Hurd and Eisenberg (1975) performed a similar experiment on
houseflies using 50% gene flow and got the same results.

<P>
<B>5.5 Speciation Through Host Race Differentiation</B>

	Recently there has been a lot of interest in whether the dif-
ferentiation of an herbivorous or parasitic species into races living
on different hosts can lead to sympatric speciation.  It has been
argued that in animals that mate on (or in) their preferred hosts,
positive assortative mating is an inevitable byproduct of habitat
selection (Rice 1985; Barton, et al. 1988).  This would suggest that
differentiated host races may represent incipient species.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=-1>5.5.1 Apple Maggot Fly (Rhagoletis pomonella)</FONT></B>

	Rhagoletis pomonella is a fly that is native to North
America.  Its normal host is the hawthorn tree.  Sometime during
the nineteenth century it began to infest apple trees.   Since then
it has begun to infest cherries, roses, pears and possibly other
members of the rosaceae.  Quite a bit of work has been done on the
differences between flies infesting hawthorn and flies infesting
apple.  There appear to be differences in host preferences among
populations.  Offspring of females collected from on of these two
hosts are more likely to select that host for oviposition (Prokopy
et al. 1988).  Genetic differences between flies on these two hosts
have been found at 6 out of 13 allozyme loci (Feder et al. 1988, see
also McPheron et al. 1988).  Laboratory studies have shown an
asynchrony in emergence time of adults between these two host races
(Smith 1988).  Flies from apple trees take about 40 days to mature,
whereas flies from hawthorn trees take 54-60 days to mature.  This
makes sense when we consider that hawthorn fruit tends to mature
later in the season that apples.  Hybridization studies show that
host preferences are inherited, but give no evidence of barriers to
mating.  This is a very exciting case.  It may represent the early
stages of a sympatric speciation event (considering the dispersal
of R. pomonella to other plants it may even represent the beginning
of an adaptive radiation).  It is important to note that some of the
leading researchers on this question are urging caution in inter-
preting it.  Feder and Bush (1989) stated:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
	Hawthorn and apple "host races" of R. pomonella may
	therefore represent incipient species.  However, it
	remains to be seen whether host-associated traits can
	evolve into effective enough barriers to gene flow to
	result eventually in the complete reproductive isolation
	of R. pomonella populations.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=-1>5.5.2 Gall Former Fly (Eurosta solidaginis)</FONT></B>

	Eurosta solidaginis is a gall forming fly that is associated
with goldenrod plants.  It has two hosts: over most of its range it
lays its eggs in Solidago altissima, but in some areas it uses S.
gigantea as its host.  Recent electrophoretic work has shown that
the genetic distances among flies from different sympatric hosts
species are greater than the distances among flies on the same host
in different geographic areas (Waring et al. 1990).  This same
study also found reduced variability in flies on S. gigantea.  This
suggests that some E. solidaginis have recently shifted hosts to
this species.  A recent study has compared reproductive behavior of
the flies associated with the two hosts (Craig et al. 1993).  They
found that flies associated with S. gigantea emerge earlier in the
season than flies associated with S. altissima.  In host choice
experiments, each fly strain ovipunctured its own host much more
frequently than the other host.  Craig et al. (1993) also performed
several mating experiments.  When no host was present and females
mated with males from either strain, if males from only one strain
were present.  When males of both strains were present, statistically
significant positive assortative mating was seen.  In the presence of
a host, assortative mating was also seen.  When both hosts and flies
from both populations were present, females waited on the buds of
the host that they are normally associated with.  The males fly
to the host to mate.  Like the Rhagoletis case above, this may
represent the beginning of a sympatric speciation.

<B>5.6 Flour Beetles (Tribolium castaneum)</B>

	Halliburton and Gall (1981) established a population of flour
beetles collected in Davis, California.  In each generation they selected
the 8 lightest and the 8 heaviest pupae of each sex.  When these 32 beetles
had emerged, they were placed together and allowed to mate for 24 hours.
Eggs were collected for 48 hours.  The pupae that developed from these
eggs were weighed at 19 days.  This was repeated for 15 generations.  The
results of mate choice tests between heavy and light beetles was compared
to tests among control lines derived from randomly chosen pupae.  Positive
assortative mating on the basis of size was found in 2 out of 4 experimental
lines.

<B>5.7 Speciation in a Lab Rat Worm, Nereis acuminata</B>

	In 1964 five or six individuals of the polychaete worm, Nereis
acuminata, were collected in Long Beach Harbor, California.  These were
allowed to grow into a population of thousands of individuals.  Four
pairs from this population were transferred to the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institute.  For over 20 years these worms were used as test organisms in
environmental toxicology.  From 1986 to 1991 the Long Beach area was
searched for populations of the worm.  Two populations, P1 and P2, were
found.  Weinberg, et al. (1992) performed tests on these two populations
and the Woods Hole population (WH) for both postmating and premating
isolation.  To test for postmating isolation, they looked at whether
broods from crosses were successfully reared.  The results below give
the percentage of successful rearings for each group of crosses.
<p><blockquote>
	 WH X WH  - 75%<br>
	 P1 X P1  - 95%<br>
	 P2 X P2  - 80%<br>
	 P1 X P2  - 77%<br>
	 WH X P1  -  0%<br>
	 WH X P2  -  0%<br>
</blockquote>

They also found statistically significant premating isolation between
the WH population and the field populations.  Finally, the Woods Hole
population showed slightly different karyotypes from the field populations.

<B>5.8 Speciation Through Cytoplasmic Incompatability Resulting
    from the Presence of a Parasite or Symbiont</B>

	In some species the presence of intracellular bacterial
parasites (or symbionts) is associated with postmating isolation.
This results from a cytoplasmic incompatability between gametes
from strains that have the parasite (or symbiont) and stains that
don't.  An example of this is seen in the mosquito Culex pipiens
(Yen and Barr 1971).  Compared to within strain matings, matings
between strains from different geographic regions may may have any
of three results: These matings may produce a normal number of
offspring, they may produce a reduced number of offspring or they may
produce no offspring.  Reciprocal crosses may give the same or
different results.  In an incompatible cross, the egg and sperm
nuclei fail to unite during fertilization.  The egg dies during
embryogenesis.  In some of these strains, Yen and Barr (1971)
found substantial numbers of Rickettsia-like microbes in adults,
eggs and embryos.  Compatibility of mosquito strains seems to be
correlated with the strain of the microbe present.  Mosquitoes
that carry different strains of the microbe exhibit cytoplasmic
incompatibility; those that carry the same strain of microbe are
interfertile.

<P>
	Similar phenomena have been seen in a number of other
insects.  Microoganisms are seen in the eggs of both Nasonia
vitripennis and N. giraulti.  These two species do not normally
hybridize.  Following treatment with antibiotics, hybrids occur
between them (Breeuwer and Werren 1990).  In this case, the
symbiont is associated with improper condensation of host
chromosomes.

<B>5.9  A Couple of Ambiguous Cases</B>

	So far the BSC has applied to all of the experiments discussed.
The following are a couple of major morphological changes produced in
asexual species.  Do these represent speciation events?  The answer
depends on how species is defined.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=-1>5.9.1 Coloniality in Chlorella vulgaris</FONT></B>

	Boraas (1983) reported the induction of multicellularity in a strain
of Chlorella pyrenoidosa (since reclassified as C. vulgaris) by predation.
He was growing the unicellular green alga in the first stage of a two stage
continuous culture system as for food for a flagellate predator, Ochromonas
sp., that was growing in the second stage.  Due to the failure of a pump,
flagellates washed back into the first stage.  Within five days a colonial
form of the Chlorella appeared.  It rapidly came to dominate the culture.
The colony size ranged from 4 cells to 32 cells.  Eventually it stabilized
at 8 cells.  This colonial form has persisted in culture for about a decade.
The new form has been keyed out using a number of algal taxonomic keys.
They key out now as being in the genus Coelosphaerium, which is in a
different family from Chlorella.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=-1>5.9.2 Morphological Changes in Bacteria</FONT></B>

	Shikano, et al. (1990) reported that an unidentified bacterium
underwent a major morphological change when grown in the presence of a
ciliate predator.  This bacterium's normal morphology is a short (1.5 um)
rod.  After 8 - 10 weeks of growing with the predator it assumed the form
of long (20 um) cells.  These cells have no cross walls.  Filaments of
this type have also been produced under circumstances similar to Boraas'
induction of multicellularity in Chlorella.  Microscopic examination of
these filaments is described in Gillott et al. (1993).  Multicellularity
has also been produced in unicellular bacterial by predation (Nakajima
and Kurihara 1994).  In this study, growth in the presence of protozoal
grazers resulted in the production of chains of bacterial cells.
