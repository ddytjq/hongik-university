<a NAME="About"></a>About Python Patrol</h1>
The Python programming language is reputed to be "a scalable Perl". Development
is almost as rapid as Perl, and scales better in large projects. It's easier
to have private variables in classes. And yes, Python does CGI and regular
expressions.
<p>Python Patrol is devoted to the teaching and advocation of the Python
programming language.
