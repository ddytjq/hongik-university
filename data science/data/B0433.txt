        An account</u></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">1. Only registered 
        corporate bodies may open a Deposit account. A corporate body is one which 
        in its own right, can enter into legal agreements. If your organisation 
        is a corporate body you will have registered by some legal process, for 
        example registering the company with Companies House.<br>
        2. Deposit account holders do not have membership or voting rights.<br>
        3. Account holders must be resident in the UK.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Savings 
        Limits and Receipts</u></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">4. The minimum 
        required to open an account is &pound;10.00. The maximum amount is &pound;500,000 
        (representing overall limit of savings with the Society for each individual).<br>
        5. We reserve the right to withdraw the account from offer without notice.<br>
        6. For receipts through the Bankers Automated Clearing System it is the 
        account holder's responsibility to ensure that the correct account number 
        details are provided to allow us to credit payments to your account.<br>
        7. Where receipts are sent via the postal system the passbook is required.<br>
        8. Cheques can normally be accepted for six months following the date 
        they are drawn.<br>
        9. Cash and cheque deposits can be made at any branch. A handling fee 
        on cash deposits may be charged.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Cooling 
        off Period</u></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">10. If within 
        16 days of opening your account you decide that this account is not suitable 
        for you, if you write to us and advise us of this we will arrange to return 
        the balance plus interest to you. There will be no penalty charges. Funds 
        will not be returned to the account holder(s) until investment cheques 
        have cleared. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Interest</u></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">11. The interest 
        rates payable on your account are variable and we may change the rate 
        of interest at any time for any valid reason.<br>
        12. When we change the interest rates, we will tell you about the changes 
        at the earliest opportunity but at least within 3 working days of the 
        change:<br>
        (i) by general notice in our branches;<br>
        (ii) by notice in newspapers of our choice. The newspapers we usually 
        use are the Express and Star and Dudley News Group showing our previous 
        and new interest rates.<br>
        Annually we will send you a statement of interest rates paid during the 
        year (unless your account balance is below &pound;100).<br>
        13. You can find out what interest rates apply to your account at anytime 
        by contacting any of our Branches or Head Office on (01384) 231414.<br>
        14. Interest will be payable after deduction of income tax at the rate 
        required by law.<br>
        15. Receipts into your account will earn interest from the day of receipt 
        to your account.<br>
        16. Interest is calculated on a daily basis up to the day of withdrawal. 
        If you require an explanation of how your interest is calculated please 
        ask your local branch or contact Head Office. A written explanation will 
        be posted to you within a few days of your request.<br>
        17. Where interest is paid to a bank or building society account you must 
        provide sufficient information for this transmission. In the event of 
        insufficient information, interest will be credited to the account.<br>
        18. Interest will be paid annually on the 31st March.<br>
        19. Higher rates of interest are paid as your savings rise above &pound;500, 
        &pound;5,000, &pound;10,000 and &pound;25,000.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Availability 
        of Funds and Withdrawals</u></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">20. A cheque 
        drawn on a Dudley Building Society account will not be stopped.<br>
        21. We reserve the right not to pay withdrawals from cheques received 
        until up to 14 days have elapsed.<br>
        22. Cheques withdrawn and subsequently returned for saving will earn interest 
        from the date they are received by the Society.<br>
        23. You are allowed immediate access to your money subject to a limit 
        of up to &pound;500 in cash each day or a greater amount by cheque providing 
        you have the funds in your account.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Identification</u></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">24. The Society 
        must observe the requirements of the Money Laundering Regulations and 
        therefore, proof of identity to verify name and address of the company 
        and for each individual who is a signatory to the account will be required 
        before an account is opened.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Change 
        of Name or Address</u></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">25. You must 
        notify us promptly if your name or address changes. Any notice of change 
        of name must be accompanied by evidence of the change. We may require 
        evidence of any change of address.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Repayment, 
        Issue, Closure and Transfer</u></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">26. We may, 
        without giving any reason, repay to you all or part of your savings at 
        any time after giving you at least 30 days notice.<br>
        27. We reserve the right to close any issue of the account to new savers, 
        without individually notifying each account holder.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Passbook</u></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">28. We will 
        provide you with a passbook, but it will remain our property and must 
        be returned to us on request. Your passbook must be forwarded to us, at 
        such times as we may decide, to be brought up to date or for such other 
        purposes as we may require.<br>
        29. Your passbook must accompany any withdrawal and any further investment.<br>
        30. If your passbook has an entry which seems to be wrong, you should 
        tell us as soon as possible so we can resolve matters.<br>
        31. You must immediately notify us by contacting any of our Branches or 
        Head Office on (01384) 231414 if you discover that your passbook is missing. 
        You must then confirm this in writing.<br>
        After you have provided such evidence regarding the loss, and given any 
        indemnity and paid such fee (if any) which we may require, we may transfer 
        the amount in the account to a replacement passbook after seven days have 
        elapsed. If someone other than you, produces your passbook to us, pretends 
        to be you or to be authorised by you, and is therefore able to withdraw 
        money from your account, you will be liable for the amount of any withdrawals 
        if you have acted fraudulently or with gross negligence.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Retention 
        and Set-Off</u></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">32. Provided 
        we give notice in writing, we have the right to retain and set-off all 
        money in any account you hold with us against any Indebtedness you may 
        have to us, whether under a mortgage, guarantee or otherwise, which is 
        due for payment or Repayment, but has not been paid or repaid as the case 
        may be. Interest or bonuses will not be paid on any money used in this 
        way.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><u>Variation 
        of Terms and Conditions</u></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">33. These terms 
        and conditions (other than rates of interest) may be varied:-<br>
        (a) to reflect general market conditions and standards (including the 
        terms of which similar accounts are offered by other financial institutions);<br>
        (b) so that we can compete more effectively with other financial institutions;<br>
        (c) to improve efficiency and/or reduce costs;<br>
        (d) to give extra benefit to investors (including making the terms of 
        the account easier to understand).<br>
        (e) to take account of changes in the law, decisions of the Ombudsman, 
        Regulator or similar person or any code of practice with which we intend 
        to comply;<br>
        (f) the needs of the business justify a change<br>
        (g) if you agree:<br>
        These terms and conditions will only be changed after at least 30 days 
        notice has been given to you. This notice will be provided:<br>
        (a) through general notice in our branches; or<br>
        (b) by advertisement in newspapers of our choice. The newspapers we usually 
        use are the Express and Star and Dudley News Group.<br>
        34. If any of these changes is clearly to your disadvantage they will 
        not take effect until we have personally written to you giving you at 
        least 30 days notice of the change. If you are not satisfied with the 
        changes we propose to make, you may within 60 days of us personally writing 
        to you, ask us to switch your account or close it. Any notice period applying 
        to your account during the 60 day period will be ignored and you will 
        not incur any additional charge or interest penalty.<br>
        35. Where there has been a significant change to the terms and conditions 
        in any one year, we will send you a copy of the new terms and conditions 
        or a summary of these changes. </font></p>
