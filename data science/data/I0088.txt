Joe Cole News 2001<p>
</font><b></center><font color="#ffffcc">
27th December 2001<br></b>
England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson need look no further than Michael Carrick and Joe Cole for this summer's World Cup campaign. The West Ham duo are really starting to look the business and if they can carry their form into the New Year, they'll be on the plane for Korea/Japan 2002.<br>
Sven-Goran Eriksson's been England manager long enough to know that the only time the three lions lifted the World Cup it was thanks to West Ham. Geoff Hurst fired the most famous hat-trick in history, Martin Peters grabbed a goal and Bobby Moore lifted the trophy. The Jules Rimet trophy was as claret and blue as much as it was gold in '66.<br>
And if Sven's got any sense, he'll be taking at least three Hammers to the Far East in six months time. David James is the Premiership's on-form England keeper this season and, with David Seaman still struggling with a shoulder injury, Jamesy must fancy his chances of making the international number one jersey his own.<br>
But England's future, including the impending FIFA World Cup, is at the feet of the two classiest midfield-men in the land: Michael Carrick and Joe Cole.<p><b>
23rd December 2001<br></b>
West Ham manager Glenn Roeder has leapt to the defence of Joe Cole, insisting: "He is not a diver."<br>
Leicester defender Matt Elliott was incensed with Cole and claimed - via Foxes manager Dave Bassett - that he did not make contact with him when he went down and earned his side a penalty in Saturday's 1-1 draw.<br>
Elliott then looked to push Cole when he was on the ground and earned a red card for violent conduct when he appeared to headbutt Hammers midfielder Trevor Sinclair as his anger boiled over.<br>
Bassett said: "Matt is adamant that he did not make contact with Joe Cole. That's why he was so frustrated and irritated with him."<p><b>
24th September 2001<br></b> 
Glenn Roeder admits that he is growing increasingly concerned at Joe Cole's continued foot injury - nine weeks after the star sustained it.
Cole, who picked up the injury in a pre-season friendly with Bishops Stortford, sat out Sunday's 3-0 victory over Newcastle after complaining of pain in his foot.<br>
And, despite playing the previous five games for The Hammers this season, the troublesome injury is showing no signs of clearing up which is causing the boss some concern.
He said: "I have to be very concerned because it is nine weeks now since Joe first picked up the injury.<br>
"He has had two scans on it which are perfectly clear, but he is getting a pain through two or three bones in the foot.<br>
"I decided it was the right thing to do at the beginning of the week to take him away from training and playing until it is cured. You would have thought that after nine weeks, bone bruising would have cleared up by now.<p><b>
2nd September 2001<br></b>
Joe Cole says he has plenty more to give to his country and The Hammers after firing England Under-21s to a 2-1 win over Germany on Friday.<br>
Cole scored the first goal for the England youngsters in Freiburg, dribbling through the German rearguard and calmly rolling the ball home.<br>
But the 19-year-old midfielder has promised that he has plenty more goals and skill to show as he looks to earn himself a permanent place in England's senior squad.<br>
The delighted Hammers ace said: "I'm 19, I've got good experience in the Premiership and I have played senior international football.<br>
"I've done OK, but I don't think people have seen anywhere near the best of what I can do. There's plenty more to come from me."<p><b> 
1st September 2001<br></b>
Joe Cole scored England's opener and Arsenal's Francis Jeffers cracked an injury-time winner to see the Under-21s beat Germany 2-1 on Friday.<br>
Cole gave England the lead in Freiburg with a superb solo effort, when he wriggled into the left side of the penalty area and rolled a shot into the far left-hand corner.<br>
England's 1-0 lead looked to be good enough before the Germans headed a last-minute equaliser, with Christoph Metzelder nodding in a long cross.<p><b>
21st July 2001<br></b>
boss Glenn Roeder has moved to quash speculation that Paolo di Canio and Trevor Sinclair are on their way out of Upton Park.
Speculation has linked both players with moves away from London in recent weeks. Manchester United are reportedly interested in bringing di Canio to Old Trafford while Newcastle failed with a £6million bid for Trevor Sinclair on Thursday.
But new Hammers chief Roeder has issued a 'hands-off' warning to any club hoping to land any of his star players.
"I had a chat with Paolo di Canio the other day and it was a very positive one. His standards are so high, he just wants the club to do as well as possible," said Roeder.
"Trevor Sinclair, Paolo di Canio, Freddie Kanoute, Joe Cole, Michael Carrick - none of them are available.
"I'm under no pressure to sell and in fact, like most managers in the Premiership I am looking to add to my squad."
Former England winger Sinclair, speaking after The Hammers' 7-0 friendly win over Bishop's Stortford, claimed he was unaware of any interest from Newcastle boss Bobby Robson, and added on told Sky Sports: "I don't know where the story came from. Without a doubt I see my future at West Ham."<p><b>  
14th June 2001<br></b>
Joe Cole has pledged his short-term future to Upton Park by declaring he does not want to leave. 
The England Under-21 midfielder has seen Rio Ferdinand join Leeds for £18million and Frank Lampard is on the verge of an £11million move to Chelsea. 
But Cole is not ready to quit and told The Sun: "I'm not going anywhere. I am happy and I am staying here." 
West Ham are widely rumoured to be poised to confirm Hammers coach Glenn Roeder as Harry Redknapp's successor and Cole's pledge of loyalty offers a timely boost. 
"Whoever the new boss is can count on me to give him everything for West Ham next season. It's always been my dream to win something with West Ham." 
But Cole has given his backing to Lampard's decision to leave West Ham. 
"Frank has made the right move by leaving. He can go on to fulfil his potential at Chelsea. 
"It was said he had it easy here because his dad and uncle ran the team but sometimes that can that can make it even harder. 
"I wish him well at Chelsea and there may even be less pressure for him at a new club." 
Cole has also called on West Ham's next manager to make him captain. 
"If you watched me last season, you will notice that whenever there was a bad result I took the brunt of the criticism. 
"A lot of people thought it didn't bother me but it did, although I chose not to show it. That's what a captain does and I wouldn't say no to the job at West Ham."<p><b> 
1st June 2001<br></b>
Sven Goran Eriksson has revealed that Joe Cole and Michael Carrick will play for the England under-21 side against Greece on Tuesday night.
The under-21 squad has been depleted by injury, and with Eriksson having few worries at senior level with regard to injuries for the World Cup qualifier against Greece on Wednesday, he has allowed the Hammers duo to play ninety minutes for the under-21's the night before the seniors game.<p><b>
29th May 2001<br></b>
Joe Cole flies out with England to La Manga in Spain today, vowing to improve his game for next season.
Cole had a disappointing season last year, but next week will be looking to win his second senior cap after coming on for his debut last Friday in the 4-0 win over Mexico at Pride Park.
"I am just happy to be involved and if there is a possibility of me playing then I want to take it with both hands," he said.
And Cole says he will be equally as eager to impress the new West Ham manager next season. "I am learning something new all the time and I know I have to work hard to become a regular in the side. No-one likes being on the bench or in the reserves, so I am going to have to push myself more next season."<p><b>
26th May 2001<br></b>
Joe Cole and Michael Carrick both played the second half in England's 4-0 thrashing of Mexico.
The pair were two of ten changes made by Sven Goran Eriksson after the break ahead of the crucial World Cup qualifier against Greece in Athens next week.
Both of them put in competent displays in front of a packed Pride Park crowd, although Cole may feel he should have got on the scoresheet.
The West Ham youngster hit a close range shot at the keeper with half the goal gaping.
Eriksson has hinted he may trim his squad ahead of the Greece trip but the duo seem to have done enough to book their seats on the plane.<p><b>
20th May 2001<br></b>
Joe Cole and Michael Carrick have both been called up to the England squad for the Mexico friendly and the World Cup qualifier with Greece.
The Hammers pair have been called up by coach Sven Goran Eriksson to face Mexico at Derby's Pride Park this coming Friday, May 25, and for the crucial trip to tackle Greece in Athens on June 6, where valuable points are up for grabs in the quest to qualify for next year's World Cup in Japan and South Korea.<p><b>
11th May 2001<br></b>  
Joe Cole insists he is happy to stay at West Ham as speculation mounts over the future of the club's midfield stars.
In the wake of Harry Redknapp's departure from Upton Park, Frank Lampard's agent has suggested the England international will never play for West Ham again while newspaper reports are linking Michael Carrick with a move to Newcastle.
Cole is the first of the Hammers' midfield trio to state his intention to stay with the club.
"It makes me sad to see Harry go but I am still happy at West Ham," he told the Mirror. "I just don't know what to make of it all. He brought me through the ranks and it is a shame he has gone."<p><b>
23rd April 2001<br></b>
Joe Cole admits that Leeds counterpart David Batty was unlucky to get sent off on Saturday and says that he feared that he was going to follow him down the tunnel.
Batty caught Cole with his elbow early in the second half of the 2-0 victory for Leeds, however Cole was quickly to his feet and pushed the Leeds man in the chest.
Cole told the official West Ham web site, "He just knocked into me with his elbow - it happens in football. I reacted a little bit, and it was a red for him and a yellow for me. It was probably just accidental, I should think. David Batty is not the sort of player who would do anything intentionally - in midfield you are going to get tackles flying about and he is probably unlucky. Things happen in the heat of the game and, looking back on it now, if I hadn't reacted I wouldn't have got a silly booking - but the red mist just came down."<p><b>
20th April 2001<br></b>
Heskey is also in the running for the young players' award along with fellow Liverpool star Steven Gerrard, West Ham pair Michael Carrick and Joe Cole, Man United's Wes Brown and Leeds striker Alan Smith.
Only current Sky pundit Andy Gray has won both young player and player of the year awards in the same year, 1977 whilst with Aston Villa.<b><p>
11th April 2001<br></b>
Joe Cole has said that he is not prepared to become the fall guy at Upton Park and will not settle for a place on the bench.
The talented midfielder was dropped for the 2-2 draw at Aston Villa on Saturday amid talk that boss Harry Redknapp has too much individual talent in the team and not enough team work, however Cole is not happy as a bench warmer.
He told the official West Ham web site, "We've had a chat and he knows I wasn't happy about sitting on the bench. I'm never going to be, even if it is for just one game. I know I've been playing below par for the last few weeks, but then again so has 90 per cent of the team."<p><b>
21st March 2001<br></b>
It's been a testing couple of weeks for all concerned with the club following the recent FA Cup exit and disappointing league form. And you'd forgive certain players for thinking that their ambitions would be better off realised elsewhere ...
But Joe Cole is a different story. The 19-year-old midfielder has no intentions of moving further afield in his search for success - in fact, quite the opposite.
"It's difficult for me to look beyond playing for this team," he told football365. "I have no desire to leave and I don't believe the club wants me to leave. If that happened or if I never won a major trophy at West Ham, I would never live it down. I don't think it would be easy to sleep at night.
"I have West Ham claret and blue running through my veins. I'm a local boy and I love it here."
Unlike his England colleague Rio Ferdinand, Joe feels that despite the way this current campaign has unfolded, there is still plenty to look forward to at West Ham - and that includes the elusive silverware.
"There is not much I don't like about this club and I honestly believe - I know people say that I say this all the time - that this club will be successful," he said. "I want to be part of that.<p><b>
4th February 2001<br></b>
Joe Cole is to be offered a new £2million boot deal with sportswear giants Adidas.
The 19-year-old midfielder is already contracted to the Adidas stable, but they are prepared to tear up his existing deal and hand him a new contract worth a reported £8,000 per week over five years. Cole joins Manchester United star David Beckham as part of Adidas' highest paid names, but the West Ham starlet is now earning more than ten times from his sponsors compared to what Beckham did at the same age.
Adidas UK spokesman John Deakin, who also confirmed that Cole will be paid another £100,000 if he is selected for the full England team, commented: "Joe Cole is a major part of our stable and we intend to keep it that way."<p><b>
29th January 2001</b><br>
Joe Cole says he's flattered that Sven Goran Eriksson is impressed with his play but he won't let himself get carried away.
The new England boss said that Cole was the player who had impressed him most so far since he arrived in this country.
Cole says he wants to play against Spain at Villa Park next month but he won't let it affect his game.
"I have played for England at every level and it's special," admitted Cole. "If I get picked against Spain then I get picked but I'm not going to go over the top in trying to impress.<p><b>
14th January 2001</b><br>
Cole leaves lasting impression with England boss
Harry Redknapp revealed that Sven-Goran Eriksson had been hugely impressed by teenager Joe Cole in his first taste of Premiership football as England coach. 
Cole was on the losing side as Sunderland won 2-0 at Upton Park to move into second place in the table. 
But the teenager was certainly the most impressive English prospect on display, with bursts of pace and trickery even if he tired late in only his second game after a lengthy injury.<b><p>  
13th January 2001</b><br>
Joe Cole has admitted that he might suffer from stage-fright in front of new England coach Sven Goran Eriksson when the Hammers take on Sunderland today.
"Sometimes you can try too hard to impress," said Cole. "I don’t usually suffer from nerves but when we did skills sessions during training with England under Kevin Keegan, I was very nervous."
There is no hiding that this a big game against Sunderland but Eriksson will judge players over the whole season not just one game.<p><b> <!-- text below generated by server.
