<p class=roman>Surviving Your Second Year as a Basketball Coach
<hr size=2 color=#000000>
<p class=roman>Chapter 1 - Oh John! Oh Mary! What do we do now that the season is over?
<hr size=2 color=#000000>
<p>NO, NO NO!!! You can't end Star Wars II with Hans Solo being frozen and make
me wait another year before I get the next installment. This is just cruel
and inhumane punishment. NO, NO, NO!!!!!

<p>Is this how you felt a week after your basketball season ended? You'd think
that being  grownups  and  big people, you'd know what to do now that you
finally have some free time, but NOOOOO!!  You missed the little buggers,
didn't you? No more frustrating moments because someone forgot who they were
guarding. No more smiles when a player did something right. Even that  you
could handle, but your whistle being lonely and neglected is more than you
can take.

<p>OK, so you didn't want it to end. Well, get a life cause it's over, done,
fini! There is no more till next year. So just get a life, all right!!!!!
Unless ......  yes, I said unless. UNLESS YOU  AND YOUR WHOLE FAMILY REALLY
ENJOYED IT. I'm not saying did you enjoy it. I'm saying you, your spouse,
your kids, and maybe even your dog needs to have loved it. This is the only
way I would even begin to recommend the next step into insanity. Is everyone
really, really missing it??  Well then - - - - - -

<p><b>IT'S TIME FOR CLUB BALL</b>

<p>So what is club ball? Here in St. Louis we call it select ball. In other
parts of the country it's called Club Ball. Club ball is where you try to
field the best possible players you can possibly put together, and you play
off season ball. Most basketball goes from November to February. That means
the prime season is 4 months long. So what's the flip side of this? THEY HAVE
8 MONTHS TO FORGET EVERYTHING YOU TAUGHT THEM, OR EVEN THOUGHT YOU TAUGHT
THEM. Isn't that a delightful thought?

<p>Like everything else in life, you can act or react to situations. Reacting
means you let your emotional side over rule everything. Acting upon a
situation means you think things out, before you make a decision.

<p>OK, Ed, how does this apply to basketball? Or, are you off the deep end
again? Before you ever decide to do club ball, I believe you need to get
schizophrenic. You need to sit down beside yourself and discuss why you would
even want to do club ball. You need to decide  what your priorities are. Are
you there just so the kids, AND YOU, can have fun? Are you there to teach
your players more than the regular season allows you, due to time
constraints? Why are you doing it? Here are a few reasons why you need to
decide on your priorities, before you ever jump into club ball.

<p>If you and your players are playing basketball strictly for fun, think long
and hard about not doing club ball. Here is a graphic example of why not to
play club ball.

<p>A 6'5", 200 pound Monster Child gets into a fight with little Johnny. Johnny
weighs 110 pounds, soaking wet. The fight is to be timed. It is to last 3
minutes, max. It starts off badly for Johnny. Within the first 60 seconds, he
already has 2 black eyes and a broken hand. As you watch the fight continue,
Monster Child never lets up. Even after he pummels Johnny into
unconsciousness, he still keeps hitting him. You start to scream "Let up
already, you've won. Quit it, you're killing him!" No matter what you
say or do, Monster Child will never quit until the 3 minutes are up.

<p>Got a little graphic on you, didn't I? Sorry, but you really need to see the
big picture before you react your way into something THAT IS NOT GOOD.

<p>Club teams can be exact replicas of Monster Child. They are normally coached
by power hungry, ego-driven, monsters. They want to beat every team by 50
points or more. They recruit the best talent they can find, and nothing is
more important than the win. They don't just care about winning, they also
care about how large a margin they can beat you by. Not every club team is
like this, but there are enough of them, that it sure seems like it!

<p>If you have an average old team and are doing it for fun, avoid club ball.
Your players can lose a lot more than just a game. They can lose their self
confidence and start thinking of themselves as true losers. Once you believe
something at a young age, it's hard to reverse that belief. Sometimes it's
nigh onto impossible to change your image of yourself.

<p>Kids are strange critters! Once they lose their confidence, they might
rebound tomorrow, or they may  never rebound. Being beat by a merciless club
team by a score of 60 to 2, might crush a kid. I have seen great kids with a
lot of potential quit the game because of beatings like this. They started
the game with a smile. At the end of the game, their looks and demeanor said,
"I'm no good. I suck! I hate this game and I'm never going to play it again."

<p>For an average or below team, club ball is not a Good Thing. Rather than play
club ball, find an average ole summer league where you and your kids find
similarly competitive teams and have a blast.

<p><b>LOOKING AT CLUB BALL POSITIVELY</b>

<p>Now let's look at the other side of club ball. My team will be going into 9th
grade next fall. We have played club ball since 5th grade. Are we God's gift
to the basketball community? Absolutely not!  We win a lot, we lose a lot.
Priorities is what this decision is all about. I made up my mind when they
were in 5th grade what my priorities as their coach should be. My job was to
teach them enough, so that a player who wanted to, would know enough and be
good enough to make their high school team.

<p>By playing club ball, my girls became accustomed to playing the biggest and
best players in the city. For one of my 5'8" forwards to have to guard a 6'3"
center, is just no big deal. No one intimidates them because they're used to
it. Take an average recreational league player, and see what happens when
they have to play against that same 6'3" center. They freak out to say the
least.

<p>By playing club ball, they have learned to become better players themselves.
Ever hear of the process known as osmosis? I can teach my girls a lot. But
when they see a really nice player do a new move, they try to imitate, and
they have learned a lot from simply playing against better players. My girls
would not be half the player they are today, if we had stayed in a rec
league. So if your priority is to teach your players the game, then club ball
may be for you.

<p><b>THE NEWEST/OLDEST RAGING CONTROVERSY </b>

<p>"But these are just kids. If they play club ball, won't that interfere with
their other sports?" I've heard this 100 times in the last few years. Guess
what? Unless your kid is the exception to every rule, it's now a one letter,
maximum 2 letter, universe.

<p>I have listened to coaches argue this point for hours. What it boils down to
is this:  If you live in a small town, there is a good chance you can play 3
sports and make your high school team. If you live in a large city, it's nigh
onto impossible. What these coaches are really arguing about is the way they
would like it to be.

<p>I live in St. Louis and am going to use my town as the example. Girls start
playing select basketball in 4th grade. A non-select season lasts 4 months.
Select teams will play 11 months  a year,  or 7 more months than a non-select
player. Between what they learn in the extra 7  months from their coach, and
the extra experience they gain just from playing more, a select player has a
much better chance of making their high school team, than a non-select
player. This same scenerio exists in soccer, volleyball, and in
baseball/softball.

<p>When you hear someone arguing about kids shouldn't have to decide what sports
to "major" in at such a young age, you are hearing wishful thinking. I wish
the same thing as they do. I wish that in 5th grade my daughter could have
played 3 or 4 different sports, and taken her time figuring out which ONES
were for her. If she had spent equal time on every sport, and had done this
up until 7th or 8th grade, she would never have made any of her high school
teams. If you snooze, you lose!

<p><b>PRIORITIES </b>

<p>As I said in the beginning it's time for you to make another major decision,
what are your priorities as a coach? And, you also need to know what your
players priorities are. You may not be into select or club ball. You are
coaching for the fun of it, and not worrying about your player's future high
school team, but what if  some of your players  want to make their high
school team when they get old enough? If this is the case, help them find an
off-season team to join. Don't agree to coach off season unless you really
want to. You either are hooked on the game, or you're not. It's time for you
o make an honest decision on what your goals are as a coach. Then decide on
club ball.

<p><b>OK, I'M CRAZY - LET'S DO IT! </b></p>

<p>You know the saying, "Boy, is he out in left field!" Folks, I bought stock in
left field, so I have to go there occasionally. This is one of those times.
You know how you get an idea in your head, and if you don't do something
about it right then, you know you'll forget it later? And when you do forget
it, you remember just enough to honestly believe that the one true original,
money making thought that will change mankind and your life forever, just
escaped you.That's where this next paragraph is coming from.

<p>We all have images of things. Some of you are probably imagining us sitting
in our coaches shorts, whistles around our necks, with a diagram of a
basketball court in front of us, while we type this out on our keyboards.  **
WRONG **  I am sitting in my kitchen, chain smoking, and thinking that an
Absolute and tonic sure would sound good about now. Blew your image of me,
didn't I? Actually, I'm not drinking the Absolute because I don't like to
drink at home. If I drink, it's at a pub or a restaurant.

<p>Now, the really fun part is have you ever wondered how the author imagined
the readers of his book? I can see you now. You have just decided to coach
club ball and you jump up from your monitor.  On your computer desk is a
plaque from your players that reads, "To The World's Best Coach." On your
fireplace is a trophy that your team won for coming in 2nd or 3rd in a
tournament. And you are more proud of that plaque and trophy than anything
that you ever won at work. I like my image of you folks, so please don't ever
tell me I'm wrong, OK? I like people whose hearts are in the right place.

<p>ANYWAY, you jump up and yell, "I'm gonna do it. Club ball is for me!" I can
see you guys in your tight old fashioned basketball shorts, and they are too
short. You have long knee-high socks, (the ones with 3 red stripes at the top
and go all the way up your leg to right below your kneecaps,) brand new Nikes
on, and an old fashioned he-man shirt on, and your beer gut is hanging out.

<p>I can see the women who read this. You women aren't as out of touch with the
fashion world, as are your male counterparts. You have on a matching
nylon/polyester sweat suit. You know, the one's that go - swish, swish,
swash as you walk. They make that crinkly, aluminum foil sound as you walk.
The older women have embroidered stuff on the shoulders and top of the sweat
suit. The younger of you just have some sports logo on yours.

<p>None of the above was meant as an insult. Sometimes I just have to go out
into left field, just for the fun of it. Anywho - You are ready, when you
realize you are at home and don't know what to do next. So you sit back down
in front of your monitor and keep on reading. That brings us to ...

<p><b>HOW TO SELECT PLAYERS FOR YOUR CLUB TEAM </b>
<ol>
<li>The first way is so simple, just take the kids who were on your regular
team. </li>

<li>If there are some kids from your team that you don't want on your club
team, just don't invite them. Don't make a big production out of it. No 20
minute speeches on why you didn't invite them. Just keep your mouth shut and
don't invite them. When they find out, just tell them what the real reason is
and again, don't make it long and drawn out. </li>

<li>Have tryouts. I went into this a lot in my first book. I'm going to give
you 3 simple rules for club ball. Get some heigth. Take ball handlers over
shooters who can't dribble. (It's easy to teach the ball handlers how to
shoot.) And don't take anyone who is not coachable. (Superstars with an
attitude are cancerous and will kill a team.) </li>

<li>Remember, for you more experienced coaches, this is for younger kids. Simple
is Good! We don't want to get too complicated. If you have a team with kids
that can handle a ball, have some heigth, and are coachable, what else do you
really need at this age? </li>
</ol>

<p>Alright, you win! You want some drills for your tryouts, so here you go:

<ol><li>Have them do a suicide while dribbling the ball right handed. Then have
them do one while dribbling left handed. This will show you about their
agility, speed, ball handling, and endurance. </li>

<li>Have them play a 3-on-3 game. This shows you ball handling, whether they
are a team player, whether they have court vision, and can they shoot. </li>

<li>Have them play a no dribble scrimmage. This let's you see if they can
move without the ball. It also shows you their passing abilities, and court
vision. </li>
</ol>

<p>This is all you really need for this age. I presently coach 8th grade girls
and needed several players. For the tryouts, I had them do #1 and #2, and
that's it.

<p>All this seems too simple, right? Well, there is a small catch to it. If you
are interested in a player after they pass your tryouts, tell them they are
invited to 2 or 3 of your L.S.'s. No final decision will be made until then.
Get them to your L.S.'s so you can find out if they are coachable.

<p>Here's why I suggest this.  I am coaching my daughter's 8th grade team. As I
told you before, we are a club or select team. There is a girl who is a young
9th grader that wanted to join our team and she was about the same age as my
girls. Her resume was great, she was awarded the mvp of her freshman team. I
have an mpv 9th grader trying out for  my 8th grade team, seems like
everything is right in the world, right?

<p>I accepted this girl on the team on a temporary basis, until I saw how she
played in a game. Folks, this girl never learned anything about m-2-m
defense. Sure, she had a sweet little shot, but that's all she had. Whoever
was her previous coach had neglected passing and defense. This made me thank
the day that I decided not to take a player until she had played with us for
a while.

<p>I will take a coachable average kid over a superstar with an attitude every
time.  If they pass your tryouts and are coachable, sign them up. And
speaking of signing them up, get everyone of them to sign a contract. This
will help you avoid 90% of all of your future problems. You will find a
sample contract in Book 1.

<p><b>GYMTIME FOR YOUR LS'S </b>

<p>In book 1, I spent a lot of time giving you the info on how to do this. So if
you have forgotten, go back to Book 1.

<p><b>FINDING GAMES TO PLAY </b>

<p>Again, I spent a lot of time on this in my first book. The basics are all
there. What I am going to add here is a few website addresses that might

<p>Call 1-800-aau-4usa  and this puts you in touch with your local AAU office
and then just quiz them.

<p>This gives you what you need to start your first club team, so  I'm going to
end this chapter the same way I began it. You need to decide what your
priorities are, before you ever decide whether to  start your own club or
select team. Your team is going to follow your direction - make sure you have
a positive direction for them to follow.

<p>This booklet is a work in process. This means that as I have more chapters, I
will post them one at a time. So keep on coming back to this website, because
there will be more. </p>
