            <p class="plaintext">To save in an E-ISA account, you must be aged 
            16 or over. You must also be resident and ordinarily resident 
            in the UK, or if not so resident, perform duties as a Crown employee 
            serving overseas (or be married to a person who performs such 
            duties).</p>
            <p class="plaintext">If you cease to be resident and ordinarily 
            resident in the UK, or to perform duties as a Crown employee serving 
            overseas (or to be married to a person who performs such duties), 
            you must notify us. Interest earned will continue to be tax-free 
            but you will not be allowed to make further deposits until you 
            meet the residency requirements again.</p>
            <p class="plaintext">Your ISA savings must remain in your beneficial 
            ownership and must not be used as security for a loan.</p>
            <br>
			<p class="biggreentext"><a name="rules"></a>Rules of the Society</p>
            <p class="plaintext">As a member, the Society's rules will apply 
            to you. A copy of the rules is available on request. See <a href="/contact_us/index.jsp">Contact us</a></p><br>
            <p class="biggreentext"><a name="deposits"></a>Deposits</p>
            <p class="plaintext">The minimum initial deposit is &pound;10.</p>
            <p class="plaintext">The maximum amount you can deposit is &pound;3,000 
            in each tax year up to and including 2005-2006 and &pound;1,000 
            in each subsequent tax year, though this is subject to review 
            by the Government. The maximum amount applies irrespective of 
            any withdrawals you may make.</p>
            <p class="plaintext">If you deposit money in your E-ISA in any tax 
            year, you will not be able to deposit money in another cash mini 
            ISA or a maxi ISA in that tax year.</p>
            <p class="plaintext">Your initial E-ISA deposit must be by cheque. 
            This deposit will start to earn interest on the first working 
            day after 2 working days have elapsed (not including the day the 
            cheque is credited to your account). A cheque credited to your 
            account on a Saturday is treated as received on the next working 
            day (working days exclude Saturdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays). 
            <p class="plaintext">Any cheques subsequently received will be returned to you.</p>
            <p class="plaintext">Additional deposits (minimum amount &pound;10) 
            must be transfers, either from another bank or building society 
            account, e.g. by standing order, or another account held with 
            the Yorkshire. Deposits by account transfer will start to earn 
            interest on the day they are credited to your account.</p><br>
            <p class="biggreentext"><a name="withdrawals"></a>Withdrawals</p>
            <p class="plaintext">The minimum amount you can withdraw is &pound;10, 
            and you must maintain a minimum balance of &pound;10. Funds withdrawn 
            earn interest up to, but not including, the day of withdrawal.</p>
            <p class="plaintext">You will not be able to withdraw against your 
            initial cheque deposit until the first working day after 4 working 
            days (not including the day the cheque is credited to your account) 
            has elapsed. If the cheque is returned unpaid, we will deduct 
            the amount from your balance even if we have allowed withdrawals 
            against it.</p>
            <p class="plaintext">Withdrawals will only be allowed either by:</p>
            <ul class="plaintext">
            <li>logging onto our website to transfer to your nominated bank 
            or building society account or a nominated account held with 
            us, or</li>
            <li>arranging a transfer to another ISA provider.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="plaintext">In the case of transfers to another account 
            held with us, the funds will normally be credited the next day. 
            Transfers to an account at another bank or building society could take up to 5 working days to be credited.</p>
            <p class="plaintext">We can limit the amount that may be withdrawn 
            from your account at any time without giving you notice if we 
            reasonably consider it necessary in order to protect the interests 
            of our members as a whole.</p>
            <br>
			<p class="biggreentext"><a name="interest"></a>Interest rate changes</p>
            <p class="plaintext">Subject to the guarantee that the interest 
            rate will not be more than 1% below the Bank of England's Base 
            Rate, we can change the E-ISA interest rate at any time if we 
            reasonably believe the change is needed for any of the following reasons:</p>
            <ul class="plaintext">
            <li>to reflect general market conditions (including interest rates 
            generally, interest rates available on wholesale money markets 
            or similar investments, or the terms on which similar accounts 
            are offered by other providers)</li>
            <li>so that we can compete more effectively with other providers</li>
            <li>our costs have increased or are expected to do so</li>
            <li>to maintain our financial strength for the benefit of all 
            our customers (for instance, to enable us to achieve operating 
            margins or profit levels which we consider necessary)</li>
            <li>to take account of the base rates of clearing banks</li>
            <li>to achieve a reasonable balance between the rates of interest 
            payable on loans and savings accounts</li>
            <li>to manage the rate of growth of our business and observe statutory 
            operating limits</li>
            <li>to retain adequate liquid assets in accordance with our statutory 
            obligation</li>
            <li>to adjust interest rates following a merger</li>
            <li>to take account of changes in the law, decisions of an ombudsman, 
            regulator or similar person, or any code of practice with which 
            we intend to comply</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="plaintext">We will tell you about changes to the E-ISA 
            interest rate within 30 days by e-mail.</p>
            <br>
			<p class="biggreentext"><a name="terms"></a>Changes to terms</p>
            <p class="plaintext">We can change E-ISA terms at any time (other 
            than interest rates and any charges) if we reasonably believe 
            the change is needed. Changes may include the removal of or amendment 
            to terms or the inclusion of new terms for any of the following 
            reasons:</p>
            <ul class="plaintext">
            <li>to enable us to operate and administer your account more efficiently 
            (which includes improving our efficiency)</li>
            <li>to give you extra benefit (including making the terms of your 
            account easier for you to understand)</li>
            <li>to correct errors</li>
            <li>to reflect practices and conditions in the building society 
            and banking sectors</li>
            <li>to take account of developments in technology</li>
            <li>to take account of a decision by a court or tribunal, or a 
            ruling by an ombudsman, regulator or similar authority as we 
            interpret it</li>
            <li>to take account of changes to laws, codes of practice or other 
            regulations to which we are subject</li>
            <li>if you agree.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="plaintext">We may also change these terms for any other 
            valid reason where we reasonably believe change is appropriate. 
            As E-ISA meets the CAT standards, any changes made to terms will 
            be in accordance with the CAT standards.</p>
            <p class="plaintext">We will notify you of any change in terms:</p>
            <ul class="plaintext">
            <li>no later than 30 days after the change takes effect if it 
            is to your advantage, or</li>
            <li>at least 30 days before the change takes effect if it is to 
            your disadvantage or it is neither to your advantage or disadvantage. 
            We will tell you about changes to E-ISA terms by e-mail.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="plaintext">If there have been significant changes in any 
            one year, we will provide you with a copy of the new terms or 
            a summary of the changes.</p><br>
            <p class="biggreentext"><a name="charges"></a>Charges</p>
            <p class="plaintext">Although there are no standard charges on E-ISA, 
            we may make charges for items relating to the operation of your 
            account and deduct those charges from the balance in your account. 
            The charges will reflect expenses we incur and the cost of staff 
            time and the use of our office and computer facilities. </p>
            <p class="plaintext">We can change the charges we make at any time. 
            Changes may include the removal of or amendment to existing charges 
            or the introduction of new charges. Where we introduce a new charge 
            or increase an existing charge, it will be in accordance with 
            the CAT standards and we will tell you at least 30 days before 
            the change takes effect by e-mail.</p>
            <p class="plaintext">Where we remove or reduce an existing charge, 
            we may do so immediately without notice.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="biggreentext"><a name="advisingyou"></a>Advising you of changes</p>
            <p class="plaintext">As we will advise you of changes to the E-ISA 
            interest rate and terms by e-mail, it is very important that you 
            notify us if your e-mail address changes.</p>
            <p class="plaintext">We will assume that you have received any personal 
            notification by e-mail 24 hours after sending it to you. If you 
            do not receive the notification, this will not make it invalid.</p><br>
            <p class="biggreentext"><a name="details"></a>Changing your details</p>
            <p class="plaintext">If you wish to change details that we hold, 
            for example your name, address, e-mail address or the account 
            to which withdrawals are made, we will require such changes to 
            be notified in writing.</p><br>

            account</p>
            <p class="plaintext">We can repay to you all or part of your balance 
            at any time, without giving any reason, after giving you at least 
            30 days notice, except that we can close your account immediately 
            if we believe that you have been involved in fraudulent or serious 
            criminal behaviour, breached the ISA regulations or that the relationship 
            between you and us has irretrievably broken down.</p><br>

            persons</p>
            <p class="plaintext">We do not have to recognise the interest or 
            claim of any person other than the account holder in respect of 
            money held in the account, nor will we be liable in any way for 
            failing to recognise such interest or claim, except as required 
            by law.</p>
            <br>
			<p class="biggreentext"><a name="unclaimed"></a>Unclaimed balances</p>
            <p class="plaintext">If for a period of 5 years you have made no 
            payment to or withdrawal from your account, and you cannot be 
            traced after reasonable enquiry, we may decide to close your account 
            and the money in it will be retained by us. If however you contact 
            us at a later date we will either open a new account for you and 
            credit that account with the amount of money in the closed account, 
            or repay the money to you, with interest at a rate which we reasonably 
            consider to be appropriate.</p><br>
            <p class="biggreentext"><a name="retention"></a>Retention and set-off</p>
            <p class="plaintext">We have the right to retain and set-off all 
            money in your account against any money you may owe to us (whether 
            under a mortgage, loan, guarantee or otherwise) which is due for 
            payment but has not been paid. We will give you a reasonable opportunity 
            to pay the money you owe us, and if we do retain and set-off money 
            in your ISA, we will advise you when we have done this. Interest 
            will not be paid on any money after it has been used in this way.</p><br>
            <p class="biggreentext"><a name="statements"></a>Statements</p>
            <p class="plaintext">We will not send statements to you. You will
