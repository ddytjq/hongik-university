<p><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><b><i>The Account that makes your Savings fun</i></b><u><br>
</u></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">The Ladybird Club Account is for children under the age of 16, to
  encourage them to save from an early age. The Club aims to help children understand how
  their money can grow by offering competitive interest rates and introducing them to the
  saving habit, in a fun and friendly way.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><b><i>Who can open a Ladybird Account?</i></b></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">If your child is under the age of seven, the account has to be operated
  by a parent, grandparent or other nominee/trustee.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">If a child is seven years old or more, and is able to provide a
  signature, they can have an account in their own name and run it independently.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Please ask our staff for further details on this matter.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><strong><em>How much can I invest?</em></strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">You only need £1 to open a Ladybird Club Account and you can add to
  this amount at any time.</font></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2">The most you can invest is £10,000 per child.</font></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><b><i>How and when is interest paid?</i></b></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">Your money earns interest from the day after you invest in your Ladybird
  Club Account and on every day until the day you withdraw it. The current interest rate is
  shown on our rates page.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">Interest is added to your account on the 31st December each year. You
  will receive a statement each year showing you exactly how much interest has been added
  and the total amount in your account. Normally interest is paid net of tax at the
  appropriate rate.&nbsp; However, if the child does not have to pay income tax the
  parent/legal guardian may fill in form R85 and we will pay your interest gross. Please
  read the notes for further details and ask us for this form if you need one. Our staff
  will be pleased to help.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><b><i>How and when can I withdraw my money?</i></b></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">The account holder can withdraw money from a Ladybird Club Account at
  any time. There is no need to give any notice and on visiting any one of our branches or
  agents at any time you can withdraw up to £300 in cash and larger amounts by cheque.
  Withdrawals are instantly available and penalty free. Please note cheques paid into your
  account require seven working days to clear before withdrawals can be made against them.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><b><i>How do I open an account?</i></b></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">You can open a Ladybird Club Account by simply&nbsp; filling in an
  application form and taking it to or posting it to any of our branches or agents. You must
  hand in or send your money at the same time.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">When your account is opened you will be given a free Ladybird Money Box.
  You can add further money to your account at any time with any amount, no matter how
  small.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">When opening an account with us you will need to bring some
  identification with you.&nbsp; Children who are seven or over can open the account in
  their own name.&nbsp; In this instance, you will need to provide the child's Birth
  Certificate.&nbsp; If the Birth Certificate does not show the current address we will
  require two address verifications for the parent.&nbsp; If the account is opened in the
  name of the parent, grandparent or relative, we will ask you to provide one document from
  each of the two following groups.&nbsp; If you open an account by post, then we will
  require two original documents from each of the two groups shown below to be sent to us.
  &nbsp; These documents will be returned to you.</font></p>

Parents can each give their children a lump sum that produces up to £100 income before
tax each year. But if the income exceeds £100, the whole amount is taxed as the Parents
income. This rule only applies to Parents. Children can register as non-tax payers and
receive the interest gross, as long as their total income is not greater than their
personal allowance.<br>
<br>
If you have received interest with no tax taken off, and you think you should have paid
it, or if you are not sure whether you should pay tax, you should get in touch with your
Inland Revenue tax office.<br>
<br>
You must include the amount of interest you earn in your yearly Income Tax Return.<br>
