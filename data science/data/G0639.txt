<h1 align="center"><u>An Atlas of the Universe - Links</u></h1>
<p>
This is a list of web sites which contain maps and data about the universe
on various scales.  If you have been taken straight to this links page by a web
search engine and you are looking for maps try my <a href="index.html">home page</a>
first. :)</p>
<dl>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">General Sites</font></dt>
<dd>
<li><a href="http://www.wordwizz.com/pwrsof10.htm">Powers of Ten</a> by Bruce
Bryson is a website which tries to zoom in from the scale of the universe
right down to sub-atomic scales using photos and drawings.</li>
</dd>

<dt><font color="#ffff00">Nearest Stars</font></dt>
<dd>
<li>Winchell Chung's <a href="http://www.projectrho.com/starmap.html">3-D Starmaps</a>
page is a web page devoted to maps of the nearest stars.  It contains various
maps, data, programs and links often with a science fiction theme to them.</li>
<br />
<li>At <a href="http://www.solstation.com/">SolStation.com</a> there are java
maps and some detailed information about some of the nearest stars especially
in regards to the possibility of planets around these stars and whether such
planets could be inhabitable.</li>
<br />
<li>Roger Wilcox has created <a href="http://www.stellar-database.com/">The Internet Stellar Database</a>
which allows you to find detailed information on many of the stars within
75 light years.</li>
</dd>

<dt><font color="#ffff00">Solar Neighbourhood</font></dt>
<dd>
<li><a href="http://www.hackney.co.uk/sites/gg/">The Galactic Gazetteer</a>
is a site dedicated to stars within a couple of thousand light years or so.
It also has a java applet to produce 3D maps of the surrounding stars.</li>
<br />
<li><a href="http://spacsun.rice.edu/~twg/lism.html">3-D Mapping of the Local Interstellar Medium</a>
is a web page about the interstellar medium within a thousand light years, it
also has a couple of 2D maps of the solar neighbourhood, on the scale of 400
and 1600 light years.  The maps are taken from "The Guide to the Galaxy", by
N. Henbest and H. Cooper.</li>
<br />
<li><a href="http://www.astronexus.com/">The Astronomy Nexus</a>
by David Nash has an <u>Encyclopedia of Suns</u> which has detailed information
on many of the Sun-like stars within 50 light years.</li>
</dd>

<dt><font color="#ffff00">The Milky Way Galaxy</font></dt>
<dd>
<li><a href="http://www.ras.ucalgary.ca/CGPS/">The Canadian Galactic Plane Survey</a>
is one of a number of groups attempting to map the interstellar matter in the
galaxy.  They have some schematic <a href="http://www.ras.ucalgary.ca/CGPS/where/plan/">plan views</a>
of the Milky Way galaxy.</li>
<br />
<li>Here's another
<a href="http://www.amsci.org/amsci/articles/99articles/Freudenreichcap12.html">
diagram of the Milky Way</a>
that appeared in an
<a href="http://www.amsci.org/amsci/articles/99articles/Freudenreich.html"> article</a>
in the American Scientist magazine in September 1999.</li>
</dd>

<dt><font color="#ffff00">Local Group</font></dt>
<dd>
<li>H Frommert and C Kronberg have a page about <a href="http://www.seds.org/~spider/spider/LG/lg.html">The Local Group of Galaxies</a>.
It contains lots of information and pictures on most of the galaxies in the
local group, together with some links to other local group pages.</li>
</dd>

<dt><font color="#ffff00">Virgo Supercluster</font></dt>
<dd>
<li>G. de Vaucouleurs was the first person to map the Virgo Supercluster.
Here is an online copy of his classic 1975 article on
<a href="http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Dev2/frames.html">Nearby Groups of Galaxies</a>
which contains maps of the supercluster and descriptions of many of the
nearby clusters.</li>
<br />
<li>Steve Sycamore has produced a <a href="http://sycamore.inr.net/galaxies.html">VRML Map of the Regional Galaxies</a>,
showing the distribution of the 150 nearest galaxies or so.  You'll need a
VRML viewer to see it.</li>
<br />
<li>Honeylocust Media Systems have some similar VRML programs on their
<a href="http://www.honeylocust.com/Stars/galaxies/">Galaxies in VRML</a> page,
including one showing 2500 galaxies which shows the Virgo Supercluster very well,
but you'll need a powerful computer to view it comfortably.</li>
<br />
<li>Brent Tully wrote this long <a href="http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1982ApJ...257..389T">article about the Virgo supercluster</a>
in the Astrophysical Journal in 1982.  It is still the best description of the
Virgo supercluster available.  It contains this nice
<a href="http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1982ApJ...257..389T&db_key=AST&page_ind=2&plate_select=NO&data_type=GIF&type=SCREEN_GIF">side view</a>
of the supercluster.</li>
</dd>

<dt><font color="#ffff00">Superclusters</font></dt>
<dd>
<li>There are lots of pages on superclusters and large scale structure.
Anthony Fairall has an introductory lecture on
<a href="http://www.uct.ac.za/general/inaug/fairall.htm">Large-Scale Structures in the Universe</a>,
which explains some of the historical developments of this rapidly growing field.</li>
<br />
<li>Anthony Fairall has also written this short essay on
<a href="http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/ESSAYS/Fairall/fairall.html">Superclusters, Observed Properties</a>.
It is a brief introduction to superclusters and it describes several of the
closest superclusters.</li>
<br />
<li>Andrey Kravtsov has a page devoted to <a href="http://charon.nmsu.edu/~akravtso/3d-gallery.html">Large Scale Structure of the Universe</a>,
which contains several 2 and 3 dimensional plots of galaxies out to about
300 million light years.  There are lots of links to other plots too.</li>
<br />
<li>Mike Hudson also has a page on <a href="http://astro.uwaterloo.ca/~mjhudson/research/threed/">The Local Universe in 3D</a>,
which contains some 3D plots of the nearest superclusters out to about 500 million
light years.
He also has a downloadable 2 minute MPG movie called <a href="http://astro.uwaterloo.ca/~mjhudson/PowersOfTwo/">Powers of Two</a>,
which zooms out from 200 million light years to about 800 million light years,
but even the smallest movie is a 8.8Mb download though.</li>
<br />
<li>The Tartu Observatory in Estonia has a few web pages devoted to
<a href="http://www.aai.ee/~maret/regular.htm"> superclusters of galaxies,</a>
including a VRML animation and an AVI movie.</li>
<br />
<li><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/id/jsredshift/agcintro.htm">Observing Galaxy Clusters</a>
is a web page by Jim Shields on his <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/id/jsredshift/">Adventures in Deep Space</a>
page which explains how you can observe many nearby clusters and superclusters of
galaxies with a small telescope.</li>
</dd>

<dt><font color="#ffff00">The Universe</font></dt>
<dd>
<li>There are lots of surveys trying to plot the universe out to several billion
light years.
The biggest is probably The <a href="http://www.sdss.org/">Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a>,
which aims to plot the distances of a million galaxies, but there isn't
much on their web site yet though.</li>
<br />
<li>A similar survey is <a href="http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/2dFGRS/">The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey</a>
who have collected 250 000 redshifts to show the cellular distribution of galaxies in
two directions out to about 3.5 billion light years.  Their web site also has a list of 
links to other similar surveys.</li>
<br />
<li>This <a href="http://www.astro.lsa.umich.edu/users/iotm/IOTMS/9805/">Image of the Month</a>
at the Astronomy Department of Michigan University claims to show what the
visible universe should look like.  It is the result of a computer simulation rather
than an actual map, but it shows the cellular structure very well.</li>
