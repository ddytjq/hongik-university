<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica" SIZE=2>

<B><A NAME="Buildings">BUILDINGS COVER</A></B><P>

If you opt for buildings cover, it includes your home, garage, shed, greenhouse or any building forming part of your property.<P>

You're protected against all major causes of damage including fire and smoke, theft, storm, flood, subsidence, water damage and more.<P>

Our rebuilding cost guarantee means that your cover is also effectively unlimited. If the worst happens and your home is completely destroyed, we'll automatically reinstate your property back to the way it was.<P>

If you can't live in your home until the insured damage is put right, we'll even pay the cost of alternative accommodation.<P>

<B><A NAME="Contents">CONTENTS COVER</A></B><P>

Most of the things that make your house a home are covered when you opt for our contents cover.<P>

That includes furniture, carpets, TV, video, audio, computer, kitchen equipment, glass, china and much more.<P>

When you buy something new, you don't need to tell us as you're automatically covered up to a limit of &#163;35,000. This means you don't have to work out an exact figure for your contents or contact us every time you buy something new.<P>

Even expensive items are automatically covered up to a maximum of &#163;1,500 per item. However, if you do need to increase the level of cover for a particularly valuable item, we can do that too. Just ask.<P>

<B><A NAME="Accidental">ACCIDENTAL DAMAGE COVER</A></B><P>

You can also select to be covered against accidental damage to your buildings or contents. So, if anything covered under your policy is accidentally damaged, we'll pay to put it right.<P>

<B><A NAME="Personal">PERSONAL POSSESSIONS COVER</A></B><P>

Opt to cover your personal possessions (personal effects, valuables and money) and they'll be insured both inside and outside your home up to a value of between &#163;2,000-&#163;7,500, chosen by you.<P>

You can claim up to &#163;1,500 for any one article and choose the total limit you would like to cover.<P>

What's more, even if you take your possessions overseas, they're still covered.<P>

In addition, we'll include any number of pedal cycles owned by your family. Even your money and credit cards are insured for up to &#163;250 no matter where you are.<P>

<B><A NAME="Homeworkers">HOMEWORKERS COVER</A></B><P>

If you work from home, you can choose our Homeworkers Extension.<P>

Choose a level of cover that suits you and we'll do the rest. Your business equipment, money and stock will all be covered, in your own home.<P>

</FONT>
<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica" SIZE=3><B><A NAME="WhatCost">What's it going to cost?</A></B></FONT><P>
<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica" SIZE=2>

If you're over 40, you'll get an automatic discount on your policy. This discount will be even higher for those over 55.<P>

If you want to insure a relatively new property, you could receive a further discount based on the building's age.<P>

You could also receive a discount if your property meets our minimum security requirements.<P>

And if you want to reduce your premiums even further, we can increase the level of excess applicable to your policy - it's entirely up to you.<P>

In addition to all this, it pays to keep your insurance with us. Once you've had your policy for two years, you'll receive an automatic discount off your premium.<P>

All this will happen automatically. It means real value for money, both now and in the future.<P>

In short, you're getting top quality, household insurance cover at a price you're happy with, together with a first class claims service when you need us most.<P>

You can choose to pay your premiums annually or spread the cost over the year in monthly instalments. It's up to you.<P>

<B><A NAME="Else">ANYTHING ELSE?</A></B><P>

We believe we've thought of everything.<P>

For instance, you'll also get free Legal Liability Cover as a homeowner, of up to &#163;1million. This is to pay claimant's damages or costs following accidental injury or damage in and around your home.<P>

If your keys to external doors are stolen, we'll replace your locks.<P>

And, in the event that you or your spouse are called for jury service we'll pay up to &#163;25 per day for up to 14 days for loss of earnings or expenses.<P>

We'll be there. Count on it.<P>

One call to our Emergency Helpline Service and you'll have access to expert operators who'll find reliable tradesman on your behalf. (However, there's no obligation to make use of any contractor recommended by us. The choice is yours).<P>

The Helpline also offers you a 24 hour telephone advice service to help you deal with legal problems.<P>

We'll deal with your claim as quickly and efficiently as possible, often during the very first call you make. No effort, no fuss.<P>
