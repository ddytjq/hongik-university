<h2>8.2 GCC can't find headers or libraries</h2>

<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: Why does GCC complain that it cannot open <code>-lstdcx</code>?</em>

<br><p>
<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: When I run the compiler it says it couldn't find header files
and/or libraries.  But the headers and libraries are all there, so why
won't it find them?</em>

<br><p>
<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: When I link my programs, ld.exe complains that it cannot open
crt0.o, although that file exists in the lib subdirectory<small>...</small>.</em>

<br><p>
<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: I tried to compile a program, but GCC complained about missing
header files <code>netdb.h</code> and <code>socket.h</code>.  Can somebody please
mail me those headers?</em>

<br><p>
<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: Why does GCC complain that it "cannot open -lgcc: File format
not recognized"?</em>

<br><p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: An error message about missing <code>-lstdcx</code> usually means that
the linker cannot find the standard C<tt>++</tt> library, <code>libstdcxx.a</code>
(it is truncated to <code>libstdcx.a</code> on DOS and NT systems).  Look into
your <code>lib/</code> subdirectory to see if it's there; if not, unzip it
from the <code>gppNNNb.zip</code> file.

<p>If <code>libstdcxx.a</code> exists but the linker still complains, you most
probably have a problem related to long file names on Windows 9X
(<code>libstdcxx.a</code> exceeds the DOS 8+3 limits).  For a quick fix, try
to <code>set LFN=y</code> in the environment and see if that helps.  If that
doesn't help, make sure you unpacked <code>gppNNNb.zip</code> with an unzip
program which supports long file names.

<p>This issue is further complicated if you use <small>RHIDE</small> v1.4, and is
described in full in the file <code>gnu/gcc-2.95/readme.DJGPP</code> which
comes with the GCC distribution (and which you should have read before
the installation).  Bottom line is that you need to add a line either to
<code>rhide.env</code> (the <small>RHIDE</small> distribution includes a file
<code>rhide_.env</code> which you should rename) or to <code>DJGPP.ENV</code> which
says this:

<pre> RHIDE_TYPED_LIBS_DJGPP.cc=stdcxx
 RHIDE_TYPED_LIBS_DJGPP.cxx=stdcxx
 RHIDE_TYPED_LIBS_DJGPP.cpp=stdcxx
</pre>

<p>When you add these lines, make sure neither they nor the <code>[rhide]</code>
line have trailing whitespace, otherwise <small>RHIDE</small> will not recognize
these lines.

<p>DJGPP version 2.03 and later come with these lines in the
<code>DJGPP.ENV</code> file right out of the box.

<p><small>RHIDE</small> v1.4.7 and later solves this bug, so upgrade to the latest
version if you can.

<p>See <a href="faq8_3.html">C<tt>++</tt> headers not found</a>, for similar problems specific to C<tt>++</tt> header
files.

<p>In general, if the compiler complains about missing files, you need
first to find out whether they at all exist on your system.  For C
header files, look in the <code>include</code> directory and its
subdirectories; for C<tt>++</tt> header files, look in the <code>lang/cxx</code>
directory and its subdirectories; for libraries and the <code>crt0.o</code>
file, look in the <code>lib</code> directory.  Some header files and object
files which are specific to a certain GCC version unzip into the
<code>lib/gcc-lib/djgpp/X.YZ</code> directory (where <code>X.YZ</code> is the GCC
version number, e.g. 2.95), so look there as well.

<p>If a header file indeed is not there, and you cannot find it in the
<code>djdevNNN.zip</code> and <code>gppNNNb.zip</code> distributions, it probably
means that this header belongs to a package which isn't part of the
basic DJGPP distribution.  You need to find that package and install it. 
It is important to understand that if a package is missing, getting hold
of the header files like <code>socket.h</code> is not enough: you need the
library of the functions whose declarations and prototypes are in the
header.  For <code>socket.h</code>, you need a sockets library, such as
<code>libsock</code>; see <a href="faq22_4.html">DJGPP packages</a>.  For <code>graphics.h</code>, you need GRX and the Borland-to-GRX
interface, BCC2GRX (rename the file <code>libbcc.h</code> to
<code>graphics.h</code>); see <a href="faq4_4.html">BCC2GRX interface package</a>.

<p>If the header or the library <em>does</em> in fact exist on your machine,
then in order for the compiler to find them, you should have the
following variable set in your environment<a rel=footnote href="faq25.html"><sup>13</sup></a>:

<pre> set DJGPP=c:/djgpp/djgpp.env
</pre>

<p>and it should point to the correct path of the file <code>DJGPP.ENV</code> on
your system; the file itself is in <a href="ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2/djdev203.zip">djdev203.zip</a> in
the DJGPP distribution.  In the above example it is assumed to be in the
<code>C:\DJGPP</code> directory, but you should set it as appropriate for
your installation.

<p>Many of the problems with "missing" files, including the
highly-confusing message about <code>-lgcc</code> ("File format not
recognized"), are usually caused by having the <code>DJGPP</code> variable
set incorrectly.  The following describes some problems with defining
<code>DJGPP</code> which pop up frequently on the DJGPP forum.

<p>Sometimes, people make errors in their <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> that cause
the <var>DJGPP</var> variable to be defined incorrectly, or not defined at
all (some of the more common errors are listed below).  To check what is
the actual setting, type from the DOS prompt:

<pre> set &gt; env.dat
</pre>

<p>then examine the contents of the file <code>env.dat</code>.  You should see
there a line like this:

<pre> DJGPP=c:/djgpp/djgpp.env
</pre>

<p>If a line such as this isn't there, you should investigate the cause
for this (see below for some of the possibilities).

<p>Many problems with setting <var>DJGPP</var> happen when people put excess
blanks around the <code>=</code> character, which has the effect of defining
"DJGPP " (with the blank) which is not the same as "DJGPP" (without
blanks).  You should make sure there are no such excess blanks, or DJGPP
won't find its files.

<p>Another possible cause of <var>DJGPP</var> variable not being set is that you
invoke another batch file from your <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> before the line
that sets <var>DJGPP</var>.  Make sure such batch files are invoked with the
<code>CALL</code> statement, because otherwise the subsidiary batch file will
never return to process the rest of <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> (that's a
"feature" of DOS batch file processing).

<p>The code that processes <code>DJGPP.ENV</code> assumes that this file resides
in the main DJGPP installation directory.  If that assumption is wrong,
the compiler (and some other DJGPP programs) might fail to find some of
the files or auxiliary programs they need.  <em>Do NOT move DJGPP.ENV
to any other directory!</em>

<p>Note that if you run DJGPP on Windows/NT, you <strong>cannot</strong> use long
names of the directories in the pathname of <code>DJGPP.ENV</code> when you
set the above variable in the environment; you should use their 8+3
aliases instead.  That's because Windows/NT doesn't support the LFN API
for DOS programs, so the DJGPP startup code won't be able to find the
<code>DJGPP.ENV</code> file using its long pathname.  For example, the
following setting <strong>won't work</strong> on Windows/NT because
<code>Development</code> is longer than 8 characters:

<pre> set DJGPP=c:/Programs/Development/Djgpp/djgpp.env
</pre>

<p>If the DJGPP variable is set correctly, then check the following possible
causes of this misbehavior:

<ul>
<li>You have edited the file <code>DJGPP.ENV</code> in a way that invalidated some
of the settings there; try restoring the original file from the
distribution to see if that fixes your problems.  Editing
<code>DJGPP.ENV</code> is <strong>not</strong> recommended, but if you must edit it,
make sure you are familiar with its syntax in advance.  The DJGPP server
has a page with a <a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/kb/kb_8.html">description of the <code>DJGPP.ENV</code> syntax</a>.

<p>The syntax of <code>DJGPP.ENV</code> is also described in the <cite>DJGPP
Knowledge Base</cite>,
which comes with the <code>djdev</code> distribution.

</p><li>You renamed the <code>gcc.exe</code> driver to some other name.  In this case,
you should edit the file <code>DJGPP.ENV</code> to add a section named after
the new name of GCC, which is an exact duplicate of the section called
<code>[gcc]</code>.  DJGPP start-up code uses this file to find environment
variables which it should put into the environment before the <code>main</code>
function is called, but it searches for the relevant variables using the
actual name of the program, so when you rename the executable, it can't
find its section and doesn't put the necessary variables into the
environment.

<li>You installed an add-on package based on DJGPP, which somehow redefines
the directories where GCC looks for the header files and libraries.

<p>One case where this might happen is if you install the GNAT (GNU Ada
Translator) package: its installation program alters the value of the
<code>PATH</code> environment variable so that when you invoke <code>gcc</code>,
you get GNAT's version of GCC, which searches header files in its own
directories.  This can prevent GCC from finding header files of other
add-on packages, such as Allegro.

</p><li>Your <code>FILES=</code> setting in <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> is insufficient, so GCC
runs out of available handles.

<p>You should have at least <code>FILE=15</code> in your <code>CONFIG.SYS</code>, more
on Windows.  See <a href="faq9_7.html">details about FILES= directive</a>.

</p><li>You passed the <code>-B</code> switch to GCC.  This overrides the default
location of <code>crt0.o</code> and if you follow <code>-B</code> with a directory
other than that where <code>crt0.o</code> resides, the linker won't find it.

<p>You should not need to use the <code>-B</code> or <code>-L</code> switches at all if
your installation is correct and the <code>DJGPP</code> variable points to the
main installation directory, because GCC should be able to figure out
all the linker switches itself.  If linking fails without explicit
<code>-L</code> or <code>-B</code>, check out above for the possible causes. 
</ul>
