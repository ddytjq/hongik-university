<center> <a href="http://www.eso.org/"> European Southern Observatory (ESO)</a>
Cerro La Silla, Chile
</center>

<p>
About 100 km north of Cerro Tololo (within sight when the lighting is just 
right), atop Cerro La Silla, are the facilities of ESO, 
which can nearly match telescope for 
telescope the facilities operated by both Kitt Peak and Cerro Tololo.
First-time observers actually need a map to guide them to the right dome.
Forming and maintaining ESO was a major factor in contributing to a 
specifically European astronomical community, which has made enormous advances 
culminating in ESO's construction of the 4x8m VLT well to the north at 
Cerro Paranal. My visits here came when I was on the staff at Leiden
Observatory, while Harry van der Laan took every opportunity to try making
me a good European. The overall view below shows the astrograph and
Danish 1.5m
domes in the right foreground, then moves past the 2.2m and 1-m Schmidt
domes, sweeping up to the 3.6m (with the characteristic outrigger dome
of the coude auxiliary telescope) at the summit itself. The dome
just to the lower left of the 3.6m was for the Swiss 60-cm instrument, since
replaced at that location by the 3.58-m New Technology Telescope (NTT).
This view does not include a cluster of six 0.5-1.5m telescopes behind the
viewpoint, nor the 15-meter Swedish/ESO Submillimeter Telescope (SEST) located
around the mountaintop past the 3.6m.

The ESO 3.6m telescope ("el tres-seis") was equipped in the mid-1980s with 
a powerful and 
flexible imager/spectrograph, EFOSC, which could be used to examine very faint 
targets. We turned it to the identification of faint, high-redshift IRAS 
galaxies whose IR positions were poorly determined, sometimes using slitless 
spectroscopy to identify our quarry before obtaining a more detailed slit
spectrum. This showed clearly which object corresponds to IRAS 0622-645, and 
also showed that IRAS 1344-363 is a symbiotic star that managed to masquerade 
as a low-redshift Seyfert galaxy on a quick look at the raw data. One more 
reason to do the numbers!

To come: data on AO objects, including slitless spectra

The 2.2m often delivers very good seeing, despite its (traditionally poor)
location in a saddle point on La Silla. Rumor has it that for a while,
ESO would receive proposals asking for 2 nights in the 2.2m or four nights
on the 3.6m. To judge from its control panel, this telescope speaks
German, which made me wonder why the telescope operator made fun of me for 
not knowing French. I just asked him to sit in the corner reading his French
novel and keep away from the controls, so we got along fine after that.
I used this instrument (whose control room has the thoughtful addition of a 
hot-chocolate dispenser) in part of a search for optical jets in galaxies. This 
included an emission-line map of the whole optical jet 
of 
<a href="http://www.astr.ua.edu/gifimages/cena.html">Centaurus A (NGC 5128)</a>, 
whose analysis was a real lesson in "do the numbers, 
don't just look at the pictures". At first it appeared that the inner knots 
were more sharp-edged than the outer ones, but it turns out that they all have
almost exactly the same cross-sectional structure, only differing in size 
(so of course the smaller ones look sharper-edged). This changes how one 
interprets the pressure balance (or lack thereof) between the visible gas 
and surrounding hotter material. Here's a view of the telescope console
when observing Centaurus A:</p>

<p> La Silla is also home to the 
<a href="http://www.LS.eso.org/lasilla/Telescopes/SEST/SEST.html">Swedish-ESO 
Submiillimeter Telescope</a>
(SEST), a high-accuracy 15-meter dish which has proven especially
valuable in mapping molecular gas in the Magellanic Clouds as
well as the southern Galactic plane. It is shown here while
still under construction (just after that embarrassing incident
involving software limits, the Sun near zenith, and a melted
secondary reflector), and against a fog bank after coming
into operation a year later.</p>
