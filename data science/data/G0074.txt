<h3>A.1 Scientific Highlights</h3><p>
<br>
The work programme of this project is divided into six major areas. We
summarise the scientific highlights in these areas in turn, although
in some cases there are clear overlaps. Activity overall has been very
high, leading to 112 joint publications submitted to refereed journals and
39 contributions to conference proceedings.
<br><br>
<I><B>1 Radio Galaxy Evolution</B></B></I>
<br>
High redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs, z>2) are fundamental probes of galaxy and cluster formation.  There is strong
evidence that they are amongst the <B> oldest and most massive
galaxies</B> in the early Universe and located in dense <B> cluster
environments</B>. As such they place important constraints upon the epoch
at which the first generation of stars was formed.
<br>
During the last two years we have carried out fruitful
multi-wavelength imaging and spectroscopic campaigns. Scientific
highlights include:
<br>
<UL>
<LI> Demonstrating, using powerful radio galaxies from a Cambridge
survey, that distant radio galaxies lie at the centre of the most
massive structures in the early Universe.
<br>
<LI> A detection of powerful extended X-ray emission from a very distant
radio galaxy, indicating an extremely large mass of material.
<br>
<LI> The use of the Westerbork radio survey to show that the comoving
number density of radio galaxies falls beyond a redshift of two, thus
defining the extent of the `quasar epoch'.
<br>
<LI> Obtaining the first two solid detections of CO emission from distant
radio galaxies.
<br>
<LI> Establishing, using sub-millimetre studies, that the most distant 
radio galaxies contain more dust than their low redshift counterparts.
<br>
<LI> Deep HST infrared imaging of the highest redshift radio galaxies
showing that they are not associated with well formed ellipticals, unlike
their lower redshift counterparts.
<br>
<LI> Deep spectroscopy of powerful redshift one radio galaxies
demonstrates that the interstellar medium is dramatically affected by
the passage of the radio source shocks.
<br>
<LI> The discovery of the most distant radio galaxy known 
known to date at z=5.2. 
<br>
</UL>
Many of the most interesting targets uncovered by radio surveys are
optically faint, and as such, ESO's VLT (available from April 1999),
with its huge collecting area and diverse battery of instrumentation
offers a great opportunity for European astronomers. Therefore,
we have concentrated the last year on preparing 
samples of radio galaxies for VLT studies. We have obtained and
reduced completely data for half of the 92~cm ``Westerbork survey In
the Southern Hemisphere'' (WISH), the first deep large sky radio
survey at low frequencies in the southern hemisphere.  In addition,
spectroscopic redshifts have been obtained for the first large
complete sample of the most powerful southern radio galaxies.
<br><br>
<I><B> 2 Evolution of Field and Cluster Evolution</B></I>
<br>
A key objective in the network programme is the understanding of how
galaxies form and evolve in different environments, from low/average
density regions (`field') to dense groups and clusters. It is now
understood that the environment plays an essential role in galaxy evolution.
<br>
Our studies of galaxies in clusters have produced very significant
progress towards understanding how the morphologies, luminosities and 
star formation histories of the galaxies evolve in dense environments. 
<br>
<UL>
<LI> Comparing the morphological and stellar population properties of
cluster galaxies at high and low redshift, we have found a strong
morphological evolution for the S0 and spiral populations, as well as
for the morphology-density relation in irregular clusters.
<br>
<LI> The colour-magnitude relation for early-type galaxies in rich
clusters up to redshifts $\simeq1$ indicates that the bulk of the
stellar populations of these galaxies are very old, and were 
formed at redshifts greater than 2.
<br>
<LI> The properties of the luminous ellipticals exhibit remarkably small
cluster-to-cluster variations, indicating that these galaxies are
highly homogeneous between cluster environments.  However, at fainter
magnitudes we observe a marked increase in the range of mid-UV
colours, suggesting the presence of younger populations.
<br>
<LI> We have found convincing evidence of evolutionary brightening of
the cluster elliptical galaxies consistent with the passive evolution
of stellar populations.
<br>
<LI> The brightest cluster galaxies have increased their mass in stars by
factors $\simeq2$-$4$ in the last $\simeq8\,$billion years, in
accordance with the predictions of our semi-analytic galaxy formation
models built within the context of the hierarchical scenario of
structure formation.
<br>
<LI> Using spectro-photometry of distant cluster galaxies, we
have 
carried out detailed studies of the star formation histories of
galaxies, quantifying how interactions with other
galaxies and with the cluster medium affect the starburst phenomenon.
<br>
<LI> We have found that galaxies in high X-ray
luminosity clusters are affected by the properties
of the intra-cluster gas: the integrated luminosity of the redder
cluster galaxies is well correlated with the cluster's X-ray luminosity.
<br>
Our studies of field galaxies aim at understanding the strong evolution
found at high redshift, particularly in star-formation activity.
<br>
<LI> We have set up the major programme in Europe to prepare for
and to follow-up the Hubble Space Telescope observation of a Southern
Deep Field. Five nights of successful observations were carried out on
ESO's NTT, leading to the first large set of publicly available
redshifts in the field. The group has also successfully proposed for
VLT time in 1999 for two follow-up programmes.
<br>
<LI> In low redshift star-forming galaxies, we have found Lyman alpha
to be destroyed by multiple scattering. Lyman alpha photons can only escape in the line
wings. This finding solves the long-standing problem of why Lyman-alpha
emission is weak or absent in the UV spectrum of such galaxies.
<br>
<LI> Using the new SCUBA bolometer array at the James Clerk Maxwell
Telescope (JCMT), we have opened a new window on galaxy formation and
evolution by observing  star formation hidden by dust in extremely
distant galaxies.  The galaxies detected contribute significantly to the global star formation history of the
Universe.
<br>
<LI>Interacting and disturbed galaxies constitute the largest class
amongst the sub-millimetre galaxies, suggesting that interactions
remain an important mechanism for triggering star formation and the
formation of ultraluminous galaxies in the distant Universe.
<br>
<LI> Our team has also obtained the deepest sub-mm number counts published
so far.
<br>
<LI> The evolution of elliptical galaxies in the field has been studied
using data from the Hubble Deep Field. Even at redshifts as high as
2-3, these galaxies lie on the fundamental
plane, in apparently virial equilibrium.  However, at such redshifts a
significant deficiency of large galaxies is observed, indicating
that an important fraction of the field ellipticals
formed later.
<br>
<LI> Our group has made the first unambiguous detection of the host galaxy
of a normal radio-quiet high-redshift QSO at 2.2 microns. The host
emits about 35\% of the total luminosity, being about 100 times brighter
than an unevolved L* galaxy placed at the QSO redshift (z=2).
<br>
</UL>
<br>
<I><B> 3 QSO Absorption Lines</B></I>
<br>
An invaluable and complementary point of view on the processes
governing the formation and evolution of galaxies is provided by the
study of the gaseous component of the universe as seen in quasar
absorption lines.
<br>
Their study has progressed in the direction of understanding the
extent, structure, metallicity and physical conditions of the absorbing
structures at high redshift.
<br>
In particular the following key results have been achieved:
<br>
<UL>
<LI> Studies of galaxies and identification of absorbers in the
Hubble Deep Field South. 
Spectroscopic observations of galaxies close to the line of sight to
the QSO J2233-606 in the HDF-S have been carried out. 
Several are found to be coincident in
redshift with absorption line systems seen in the HST spectrum of the
QSO. A new quasar with z=1.3351 at only 45'' angular
separation from this QSO has been detected, an ideal target for
QSO environment studies.
<br>
<LI> QSO pairs and groups.
The observations of several 
closely separated QSO pairs and gravitationally lensed QSOs, 
providing two or more adjacent lines of sight, have made it possible to 
sample the size and clustering of the absorbers.
<br>
<LI>  Simulations.
Hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation in a cosmological context
have been used to investigate the nature of the physical structures
giving rise to damped Lyman-alpha absorption systems,
the spatial distribution and absorption properties of metal enriched gas in
regions of ongoing galaxy formation, the thermal history of the
Intergalactic Medium and the dependencies of QSO Lyman-alpha
absorption line statistics on cosmological parameters.
<br>
<LI> Reconstruction of density fields. Methods for the
recovery of the real space line-of-sight mass density field from Lyman
absorption in QSO spectra have been developed. 
The matter density is inferred from the HI density assuming that the absorption
is due to a photoionized intergalactic medium which traces the mass
distribution as suggested by recent numerical simulations.  Redshift
distortions are corrected iteratively from a simultaneous estimate of
the peculiar velocity. 
This approach is an excellent tool to study the density
probability distribution and clustering properties of the mass density
in the (mildly) non-linear regime. 
<br></UL>
Molecules dominate the cooling function of neutral metal-poor gas at
high density.  Observation of molecules at high redshift provide thus an
important tool toward understanding the physical conditions
prevailing in collapsing gas.
<br><br>
<I><B> 4 Stellar Population Modelling</B></I>
<br>
The primary objectives in this area are to expand population synthesis
models to the full observed ranges of wavelengths and metallicities.
By combining the models with dynamical prescriptions for galaxy evolution,
theories of galaxy formation can then be tested against observations.
<br>
<UL>
<LI> Stellar evolution models for a full range of metallicities 
developped in Padova have been used to build new, metallicity-dependent
synthesis programmes by the Paris and Padova groups.
<br>
<LI> The new synthesis programmes were implemented into the Munich
and Durham semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to compute the
chemical enrichment, colors, and line indices of galaxies as a function
of redshift. Comparisons with observations have revealed, for example,
that the evolution of the K-band luminosity function is a powerful
way to constrain galaxy formation theories (other main results are 
described in the section on phenomenological galaxy formation models).
<br>
<LI> The Padova and Paris groups have also developed new models
of the near- to mid-IR emission from galaxies including the emission
from dust in the interstellar medium and around evolved stars. These
models have been combined with the Durham models of galaxy formation
to obtain predictions of galaxy counts and redshift distributions at
IR/submm wavelengths. These agree well with available data. The Padova and Paris groups are also developing
a model of QSO and AGN formation in a hierarchical universe, with
particular attention to the modelling of the IR/submm emission.
<br></UL>
The achievements so far in population synthesis modelling are extremely
encouraging, as the results more than match the milestones that were 
envisioned at the beginning of the network. It is worthwhile to
mention that the state-of-the-art models developed within the
network have already been made available to the general astronomical
community.
<br><br>
<I><B> 5 Semianalytic modelling</B></I>
<br>
This work aims to produce phenomenological models which can be used
to interpret observational data directly in the context of the current
theoretical picture for the evolution of structure.
<br>
<UL>
<LI> Current data on the luminosities, colours and redshifts of
faint galaxies were shown to be inconsistent with the standard model
in which massive galaxies were assembled primarily at high redshift. 
<br>
<LI> The properties of the newly discovered high value of
population of Lyman Break galaxies were shown to be consistent with
hierarchical assembly models.
<br>
<LI> The clustering of these Lyman Break Galaxies was predicted
to be strong, a result later confirmed by observation. 
<br>
<LI> Semi-analytic models of galaxy formation in a
hierarchical universe were combined with new metallicity-dependent spectral
synthesis models to compute the chemical enrichment, colors, line
indices and mass-to-light ratios of early-type galaxies as a function
of redshift. These models reproduce the slope and
scatter of the color-magnitude and Mg$_2-\sigma$ relations of 
elliptical galaxies, challenging the traditional view that luminous 
early-type galaxies form in a single monolithic collapse at high 
redshift.
<br>
<LI> New models were made for the formation and evolution of
galaxy disks. In a
Lambda CDM model, the predicted present-day distribution of disk
scalelengths agrees very well with
the observational one derived by De Jong \& Lacey (1998). The evolution
z=1 is predicted to be quite weak at
given luminosity, in
qualitative agreement with what is found from the CFRS redshift
survey.
The same models give
a good fit to the present-day H-alpha luminosity function of
galaxies and can reproduce the observed evolution.
<br>
</UL><br>
<I><B> 6 Simulations of Galaxies and Clusters</B></I>
<br>
Numerical simulations are one of the most powerful tools for studying
galaxy formation and evolution. The network has access
to some of the best computing hardware and cosmological software
in the world, since it overlaps a broad collaboration known as the Virgo
consortium which includes colleagues in the US, Canada and non-network
universities in the UK. This collaboration is arguably the strongest
numerical cosmology group anywhere. Some of the simulations carried out
within the network have redefined the state-of-the art in the subject.
<br>
Activity in the simulation area took place at Durham, Munich, Paris and Padova,
resulting in 42 joint publications during the first two years of the
network involving researchers in the first two of these locations. For the
most part the milestones were achieved and, in several instances,
exceeded. Highlights include: 
<br>
<UL>
<LI> The discovery that the radial density profiles of dark matter halos
formed in hierarchical clustering cosmologies have a universal form,
independent of mass and cosmological parameters. The characteristic density (or radial scale) of a halo
correlates with its total mass, reflecting the later formation epochs of
halos of increasing mass.
<br>
<LI> The most accurate supercomputer simulations of the dark matter
distribution in representative volumes of the universe.  These simulations
were the first to resolve individual galactic halos in volumes large enough
to follow their clustering properties reliably. They have led to the most
accurate studies to date of the clustering statistics and topology 
of the dark matter
distribution, and to detailed analyses of the internal structure, velocity distributions, formation
history, large-scale environment, and gravitational lensing properties of galaxy cluster halos.  Taken together, these
studies represent the most comprehensive analysis ever of a high precision
set of cold dark matter simulations.
<br>
<LI>  The execution of the 1-billion particle ``Hubble volume'' simulations,
the largest calculations ever done of the formation of structure in the
expanding Universe. These follow the growth of clusters and larger scale
structures over virtually the entire observable universe, allowing study,
for the first time, of a variety of fundamental statistical properties. This work
attracted considerable media attention in Europe and the USA.
<br>
<LI> The first simulations of the formation of galaxies in cosmological 
volumes. These include the effects both of the clustering evolution of the
dark matter and of the thermodynamic evolution of the gas which eventually
turns into stars. For the first time, it is now possible to calculate
numerically the formation histories of galaxies and their spatial
distribution.

<h3>PART B: COMPARISON WITH THE PROJECT PROGRAMME</h3>
<br><br>
<h3><B> B.1 Research Objectives</B></h3>
The original objectives of our network remain relevant. Indeed, the
level of research in these areas has increased substantially since
our proposal was submitted as a result of new data from the Hubble
Space Telescope and the Keck Telescopes. This is probably the single
most active and most rapidly developing field in current astronomy.
Certainly it is providing much of the justification for future major
programmes such as the Next Generation Space Telescope and the Large
Southern Array, as well as for the second generation of instruments
planned for the Very Large Telescope. Theoretical work in these areas
is also increasing rapidly, in significant part as a result of work
associated with the network.
<br><br><br>
<h3><B> B.2 Methodological Approach and Work Plan</B></h3>
Our methodology has not changed significantly from that described
in the contract. We are actively pursuing all six of the scientific 
areas in which we proposed. Some parts of the detailed research plan
have changed in response to new discoveries and opportunities, but
the basic structure has been followed almost exactly.

<h3><B> B.3 Schedule and Milestones</B></h3>
All milestones in the original contract with expected completion date 
less than 2.5 years after beginning of the contract have been achieved
with the following exceptions:
<br><br>
<I> Field Galaxy Evolution</I>: Completion of the COHSI instrument has been 
                        delayed by technical problems.
<br>
<I> Evolution of Cluster Galaxies</I>: Comparison of optical and X-ray images 
                        to measure infall rates has been displaced by
                        other related projects.
<br>
<I> Phenomenological Models</I>: The modelling of QSO absorbers by semi-analytic
                        methods has been replaced by simulation studies.
<br><br>
Additional Major activities added to the programme include:
<br><br>
<I> Field Galaxy Evolution</I>: Preparation and follow-up in 
                        the Hubble Deep Field South.
<br>

The network is coordinated from Munich by S. White; all other partners

In each node the Responsible Scientist is the point of contact for
all administrative matters. These are:

In each of the two Network hiring exercises (end of 1995 and 1997)
evaluation of postdoctoral applications in the common pool was carried
out on each site by senior scientists involved in network
programmes and was coordinated by the Responsible Scientist.
Conflicts among the choices were few and were resolved by the
Coordinator in discussion with the Responsible Scientists.
<br>
The major network meeting is held once per year: in Germany in 1997,
in Holland in 1998, and in Italy in 1999. The two meetings so far
each lasted 4.5 days and attracted 60-70 people from the network sites.
In addition a substantial number of more specialised meetings have
been held. Details, including participant lists and programmes can be
found on the network web-site.

<B> C.2 Training Programme</B>
<br>
The rationale of the network's training programme remains as set out
in the contract. Each young researcher is fully integrated into
all local activites connected with network research. In addition,
they all participate in (and speak at) each of the Annual Meetings,
as well as in smaller network workshops in areas close to their
primary research topic. The Responsible Scientists and Task Leaders
at each node are responsible for ensuring full integration of the
local young scientists. 
<br>
The training programme appears to have been successful so far. Of
the six young scientists employed in the first phase of the programme,
five have now moved on to permanent or long-term positions in
astronomy, four of those back in the young scientist's native
country. The sixth
remains employed within the network and is collaborating very actively
with several other nodes.

\centerline {PART D - SKETCHES OF THE YOUNG RESEARCHERS}
<br><br>
<B> Dr Herve Aussel:</B>
<br>
I have completed a PhD at the "Service d'Astrophysique" (Saclay, France) with
L. Vigroux as thesis advisor. I have worked particularly on deep mid-infrared
surveys of galaxies. To analyse these data, I have designed specific tools
based on wavelet analysis. I have finally worked on the interpretation of the
counts of galaxies.
<br>
We find that a large amount of galaxy evolution is required to explain the
number counts at the faint flux levels that we probe (i.e. distant [z=0.5 to
1] infrared galaxies undergo strong phases of star formation with respect to
the ones observed in the local universe). Moreover, I have shown that this
evolving population of galaxies is different from the faint blue galaxies
responsible for the evolution observed in deep surveys in the visible. The
behavior of the number counts observed in the mid-infrared is therefore
different from the one predicted by the models at this wavelength.
<br>
The general target of my activities in Padova is the investigation of distant
high-redshift galaxies detected in the infrared, to provide a complementary
view on galaxy formation and evolution with respect to what optical surveys
have offered. Basic questions to be answered will be: what is the nature
of the strongly evolving IR galaxy population? Are they starbursts or AGNs?
What is the global energetics associated with galaxy IR activity? How do
spheroidal galaxies form?
<br>
More specifically, I am working with Alberto Franceschini who has already
produced models for the galaxies counts at infrared wavelength. We aim
together at improving the models and explain my results at 15 microns. We plan
to do a detailed study of the spectroscopic properties of these galaxies in
cooperation with Bianca Poggianti, formerly at Cambridge with the TMR network.
We also are working with the team of IAS (France) and IAP (Paris) on the
interpretation of galaxy counts at 175 microns. The mid-infrared surveys
provide a good sample of elliptical galaxies. With Alessandro Bressan
(Padova), we will compare the observed emission at 7 and 15 microns by these
galaxies to the predictions of his model.
Finally, I am in charge for maintaining the web page of
the TMR network at Padova for which we have already made a brush-up.

<B> Dr Philip Best:</B>
<br>
From 1993 to 1996 I studied in Cambridge for my PhD in `Astrophysics and
Cosmology', specialising in the study of radio galaxies at very large
distances. A combination of imaging at infrared and optical (using the
Hubble Space Telescope) wavelengths together with interferometric mapping
at radio frequencies allowed a number of properties concerning the nature
and evolution of these objects to be discerned.
<br>
In November 1996 I was employed by the Sterrewacht Leiden as part of the
TMR Network. Here I have been able to continue my research into distant
radio galaxies working closely with the Leiden group who have a wealth of
expertise in this field. These collaborations have led to further
discoveries about the radio galaxy population, such as the fact that the
most powerful distant radio galaxies appear to lie at the centres of
clusters of galaxies, and have helped to connect these active galaxies to
the evolution of the more normal galaxy population. In addition to
learning from those more experienced than myself, I have also been given
the opportunity to help guide undergraduate and postgraduate students in
their own research.
<br>
Frequent meetings at the different institutes within the Network have
enabled me to learn about other research fields related to my own, and to
meet and begin working with scientists from these fields on joint
projects. Following these network meetings I am now actively collaborating
with researchers in Cambridge, Paris and Munich.
<br>
My experience of the Network has been almost entirely positive. I have
gained experience of living and working in a foreign country, the
opportunity to work within one of the world's leading groups in my
research field, and the chance to come into contact with, and travel to
continue working with, other leading researchers. My only negative
experience is that more time has to be spent on Network-
administrative matters than might be wished.

<B> Dr Malcolm Bremer:</B>
<br>
(1) Distant radio galaxies. Main result: Showed that there is a
decline in the comoving number density of powerful radio galaxies at
z>2, Links evolution of radio sources with that of ordinary
galaxies. Network collaboration Paris, Leiden and Cambridge.
<br>
(2) Adaptive optics imaging of Quasars. Main result: Discovery of
quasars close to bright stars, ideal for follow-up with new
generation of telescopes. Will be able to study the effect of
powerful AGN on their host galaxies up to z=4.5, redshift of the
highest object in the sample. Network collaboration Paris and Leiden.
<br>
(3) Searching for high redshift structures. Main result: Ongoing,
successful search for groups/clus\-ters at z=1-3. Most efficient way
of finding key cosmological structures. Now poised to carry out
multi-wavelength studies with new generation of telescopes to give
viral cosmological information. Network collaboration Paris, Leiden
and Cambridge.
<br>
(4) Searching for cool material in cooling flows. Main result:
Discovery of cool material out to 50 kpc from the centre of most
cooling flows at surface brightness levels not before
achieved. Network collaboration Paris, Leiden.
<br>
All of above are being continued and expanded as participants move
from network institutions to other posts. Network has proved
invaluable at fostering such collaborations.
<br>
Other points about network: As well as obvious benefits from
collaborations, the network has enabled me to think far more
"internationally" than I perhaps would have otherwise. This is
especially apparent on my return to the UK, I think in broader terms
than my contemporaries who have not left Britain. It is no coincidence
that many of the young scientists (myself included) who took part in
the first 2~years of the network secured tenure/good long term posts
in their next job.
<br><br>
<B> Dr Pierre-Alain Duc:</B>
<br>
As a Ph-D student and then as a post-doctoral researcher, I have
studied the environmental effects on the formation and evolution of
galaxies. The main laboratories I have used  for these studies are:
<B> 1)</B>  interacting galaxies where collisions trigger in the nuclear
regions strong starbursts  and where at the same time star-forming
dwarf galaxies may form in the outer regions out of debris of
collisions expelled in the intergalactic medium; <B> 2)</B> gas-rich
dwarf galaxies in nearby clusters of galaxies that, because of their
low mass, should be largely affected by the cluster environment; and
<B> 3)</B> galaxies in distant clusters that host obscured dust-embedded
starbursts revealed by their infrared emission.
<br>
These studies are based on multi-wavelength observations and involve
several international collaborations in which the network plays a major
role. Just hired as a TMR young scientist, I have gathered a team of
researchers from Cambridge, Paris and Padova that will carry out the
ground-based follow-up of  ISO space observations of strong infrared
galaxies in clusters. The team involves scientists with observational
and theoretical backgrounds whose skills will be especially useful for
interpreting the data. From my own experience, the TMR is particularly
useful in triggering collaborations among scientists working in a same
field but having different technical expertises.  As an example, a
direct result of  our last TMR general meeting in September is the
beginning of a collaboration with a young theoretician who will model
with numerical simulations  some of the interacting systems I had
studied so far. The TMR has offered to my research new perspectives
that I hope will last after the end of my contract.
<br><br>
<B> Dr Fabio Governato:</B>
<br>
The general thrust of my research work concerns the formation and evolution
of galaxies and galaxy clusters in a cosmological framework.  Understanding
the formation and evolution of galaxies is a fundamental astrophysical
problem, with implications in almost all branches of astrophysics and
cosmology, being a necessary step to understand morphologies and properties
of galaxies and their relationship with the local environment.  My primary
tool are numerical simulations and semi-analytical methods.  Starting from
1990 I have used a variety of N-body techniques: direct, tree and
cosmological codes (both P3M and a treecode with periodic boundary
conditions) on both scalar and parallel machines.  I have a good experience
in using N-body codes which include the description of a dissipative
gaseous component with smoothed particle hydrodynamics techniques (SPH).
I'm also experienced in using semi-analytical methods.  My duties inside
the network were to carry independent research on the formation of galaxies
and the structure of dark matter halos.  The two years appointment at
Durham University as a member of the TMR Network was a very positive
experience. It helped me to enlarge my scientific background and enabled me
to start many fruitful collaborations inside that will continue in the
future.  ``Durham's stamp of approval'' gave me a much wider personal
recognition in my field and definitely helped me finding a permanent
academic job (at the Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera, Milan).

<B> Simone Marri:</B>  
<br>
Simone Marri was an undergraduate student at University of Florence (Italy)
where I acquired some general specialization skills on general
theoretical physics, cosmology and numerical calculation methods. 
Particularly, the last part of my
studies were dedicated to investigate some aspects,
and most of all the interconnections, between
cosmological models of the hierarchical clustering family, 
high energy astrophysical sources at 
high redshift (Pop III SNe) and gravitational lensing. This work
was done under the supervision of Dr. Andrea Ferrara
of the Astronomy Department of Arcetri, in Florence.
This activity ended with the discussion of my Laurea Thesis
in September 1997.
<br>
Since 1/11/1998 I am a PhD student at the Max-Plank-Institut fur
Astrophysik (MPA) in Garching where I work under the supervision
of Prof. Simon D.M. White. My task is to study
the problem of Galaxy Formation mainly for what concern
the effects of SNe explosion: the so called feedback effect.
This problem requires an improved understanding
of gas processes which occur in the interstellar medium
and are believed to be of great importance not only in
the steady state of a galaxy but also during its evolution,
as constrained by hierarchical cosmological models.
In studying such problems, I will collaborate also with Dr. Guinevere
Kauffmann (MPA) and Dr. Andrea Ferrara (Arcetri Dep.) contributing
in this way to an effective collaboration between two
different European institutes. 
<br>
My first experiences at MPA are quite positive. I have acquired
a lot of basic information, on topics relevant for my PhD
projects, through the Global ISM workshop (Garching 18-20 November, 1998)
and I have started to be more familiar with the important experiences and skills 
acquired on the field of galaxy formation by the MPA galaxy formation
sector both for the theoretical part and for the numerical. I
anticipate that interactions with other network nodes, particularly Durham
and Paris, will increase as my project progresses.

<B> Dr Yuen Keong Ng:</B>
<br>
I started my Ph.D. research on the analysis of the photometric photometry
of a great many stars (>> 1 million **) in Field \#3 of the Palomar-
Groningen Survey. I continued with the development of a Galactic model 
based on the Padova stellar population synthesis tool to study the 
formation, structure and evolution of our Milky Way from star counts. 
<br>
After my Ph.D. I did my first post-doc at the IAP. I dedicated about 
50\% of my time to the analysis of the quality of the data obtained 
by the Denis survey. The remaining 50\% of my time was spent on the 
improvement of the Galactic model and on studies with the stellar 
population synthesis tool.
<br>
My second post-doc was done at Padova. I started with the study of population 
boxes in order to link the stellar population synthesis tool with the Padova 
spectro-photometric code. However, the integration required a more rigorous 
and objective method to analyse data with both the stellar population 
synthesis and the spectro-photometric tool. I started with the development 
of an automated analysis tool AMORE (Auto-Matic Observation REndering) for 
stellar applications which should be linked afterwards with the spectro-
photometric tool. The spectro-photometric information was subsequently 
intended to be used as input for AMORE to obtain a self-consistent calibration.
In the mean time I tested the stellar evolutionary tracks with the F and G
stars in the local Solar neighbourhood. I further profitted from the knowledge
about galacto-chemical evolution and carbon star evolution. This was applied 
to the so-called bulge carbon star mystery and I argued that the bulge C-stars
are actually related to the newly discovered Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.  
<br><br>
<B> Dr Bianca Maria Poggianti:</B>
<br>
My main field of research is the evolution of cluster and field
galaxies as a function of environment and redshift, both from the
theoretical (spectrophotometric modeling) and the observational point
of view (acquisition and interpretation of astronomical data).  As part
of my responsibilities in the Network, I have contributed to the
organization of the EU-TMR Meeting on ``Evolution of Field and Cluster
Galaxies'' in Cambridge (28/2-1/3 1997). I have presented oral
communications at two site meetings in Cambridge (28 Feb - 1 Mar 1997)
and in Paris (7-8 Feb 1997) and at the two annual meetings in Ringberg
(19-24 May 1997) and in Leiden (31 Aug-4 Sep 1998).  The fellowship
in Cambridge gave me the possibility to spend two years at one of the
most stimulating astronomical institutes in the world, and this period
has been very important for my professional and personal development
and for my next career steps. The Network experience offered me the
possibility to get in touch, through personal and regular contacts,
with the forefront research in different and complementary fields
(Radio galaxies, Quasar Absorption lines, Semi-analytic modelling,
Numerical simulations\dots), which helped me acquiring a more
comprehensive view of my own research field.  At the end of September
1998 I have completed my EU-TMR fellowship and I am now an established
astronomer at the Osservatorio Astronomico di Padova, Italy.  I am
still involved in various collaborations together with researchers from
different network sites and these collaborations are likely to continue
during the coming years.

<B> Dr Tom Theuns:</B>
<br>
Tom Theuns has been involved in high-resolution hydrodynamical
simulations of the Lyman-alpha forest. The motivation for this project
is that the physical picture of the forest is sufficiently simple that
current state-of-the-art simulation tools such as used by the Virgo
consortium can hope to resolve the structures producing the Lyman-alpha
forest. These simulations are then analysed in terms of Voigt profiles
and comparison is made against Voigt profile statistics of the
Lyman-alpha forest as measured in observed quasar spectra. The results
so far are very promising. The simple physical picture where the
Lyman-alpha forest is produced by the neutral fraction of the highly
ionized gas that traces midly non-linear, filamentary structures,
describes remarkably well the observed evolution of the number of
absorption lines as a function of redshfit, from low redshifts, as
observed by the Hubble Space Telescope, to high redshifts, as obserbed
by the Keck telescope. The distribution of line widths is a probe of
the temperature of the intergalactic medium, and comparison with
observations suggest the temperature is high. Such high temperatures
can be obtained in the standard model if the Universe has a high baryon
density but a low total matter density. A new method based on the
observed correlation of column density with line width turns out to be
extremely suited to measuring the temperature-density relation of the
intergalactic medium (work in progress).
<br>
This investigation is in close collaboration with people in Cambridge
(G. Efstathiou, J. Schaye \& B. Carswell), Durham (F. Pearce) and
Garching (M. Haehnelt). The travel funds provided by TMR have enabled
and facilitated necessary visits to collaborators as well as
conferences.
