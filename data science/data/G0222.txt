<a name="what"><h1>What's a rotating black hole?</h1>
Angular velocity is one of the only three properties of a black hole,
according to those-who-know. Rotating black holes are also known as Kerr
black holes.  It's also called a Kerr black hole for the same reason
charged black holes are called Reissner-Nordstr&#248m black holes:
Reissner-Nordstr&#248m geometry describes the charged black hole. The
Kerr solution for the metric for spacetime describes the geometry of the
rotating black hole.  Since the static and charged black holes are
spherically symmertric, the Schwarschild and Reissner-Nordstr&#248m
geometries are idealy suited to polar coordinates in two dimensions and
spherica coordinates in three dimensions. What're those? Well, instead of
a grid of lines, things are described by a lenth and some angles.
For the polar coords, lines of constant distance are circles; for the  
spherical coords, lines of constant distance are spheres. Lines
of constant angle are radial lines for both systems.
<p>
Kerr geometry uses something called oblate spheroidal coordinate system.
It's similar to polar coordinates, except lines of constant distance are
ellipses, and lines of constant angle are hyperbolas.  Now, take that two
dimensional grid-type-graph and rotate it about the vertical axis---that's
oblate spheroidal!
<p>
Why is it called a rotating black hole?  The event horizon doesn't
rotate---it's just a boundary-line.  I suppose it's more descriptive (and
unfortunatly more confusing) to say that everything else revolves around
the black hole. Since most stars rotate, when they become black holes,
they also rotate. As those stars are becoming black holes, they
shrink---and as a rotating something gets smaller, it rotates faster.
Realistically, I suppose many black holes rotate very quickly.  According
to the calculations done by Kip Thorne, most black holes would rotate with
a speed that is 99.8&#37 their mass.<a
href="breferences.html#sup6"><sup>6</sup></a>
<p>
Perhaps it would be better if I just explained how a rotating black hole
is different from the others.  First stop...
<a name="photons"><h1>Two Photon Spheres?</h1>
What's with the doubling?!  Charged black holes have two event horizons
instead of one, and now rotating black holes have not only two event
horizons but <i>two</i> photon spheres.  It has to do with the fact that
the black hole rotates, and, when it rotates, it "drags" the space around
it into rotating with it.  It's like jumping into a whirlpool.  If you
jump in the direction of the current and start swimming, you get propelled
along and go much faster than your normal speed.  If you jump in and swim
against the current, you get dragged back and go much slower than your
normal speed.  It is the same principle for photons as they try to orbit.
Instead of just having one radius where photon can orbit unstably like the
other two black holes, a rotating black hole has two radii where photons
can orbit: one in the direction of rotating and one against.
<p>
So there are two photon spheres.  How do you tell which one goes
where?  Well, orbiting against the rotation of the black hole is more
difficult.  It's easier for me to use the example of satellites around the
earth.  Take two satellites, one further from the earth and one
closer to the earth.  The one closer to the earth must go much faster in
order to stay in orbit and not go crashing down  to the planet below.  The
satellite further away can go slower and still stay in orbit.  O-K.  Now,
back to the black hole.  Say you've got two light rays, one going in the
direction of rotation and one going against it.  You can draw a
not-entirely-scientific parallel between the two situations
(not-entirely-scientific because the speed of light is a constant).  The
light ray going in the direction of rotation can kinda "go faster," so it
can orbit closer to the black hole.  The light ray going against the
rotation kinda "goes slower," so it must orbit further away from the black
hole.
<p>
Oh, did I say it had two photon spheres?  Heehee.  That's not quite
accurate.  See, since the black hole rotates, it's got an axis of
rotation.  It's no longer spherically symmetric like the other two.  Its
structure depends on what angle at which you approach the black hole.  If
you approach in the direction of the equator, then what I told you stands
true: two photon spheres.  If, however, you approach at an angle to the
equator (you know, just like lines of latitude on the earth), there is
only one photon sphere.  Why?  Well, if you come in from the top, there
isn't really a choice of whether you should go with or against the
rotation.
<p>
<a name"between"><h1>What's between the two photon spheres?</h1>
A sensible question.  Between the counterrotating and the corotating
photon spheres are the different photon spheres for light rays approaching
the black hole not quite on the equator.  This is confusing, so perhaps I
should use another example.  Imagine that you're floating above the earth
in a spaceship.  You can come in for a landing on the equator in Equador,
further from the equator at Syracuse, New York, or on the axis of rotation
at the North Pole.  Say the earth is a rotating black hole and you are a
light ray.  If you came in towards "Equador," you would encounter the
counterrotating photon sphere at one point, and you could merrily and
unstably orbit the black hole against the direction of rotation.  Going in
further you would find the corotating photon sphere, and you could happily
orbit unstably in the direction of rotation.  If you came in towards
"Syracuse" or the "North Pole," there would only be one photon sphere for
ya.
<p>
The placement of the two photon spheres all depends upon the speed of
rotation.  For a slowly rotating black hole the two are so close to one
another (on the equatorial plane, remember) that it's almost like the
photon sphere of a non-rotating black hole.  The faster the black hole
rotates, the further apart the two photon spheres are.  A black hole that
rotates with a speed as great as its mass (again, the numbers we're
blithely bandying about are sickeningly huge, since the mass of the
smallest possible black hole is 5.7 x 10<sup>30</sup>kg --- meaning it
would have to have an angular velocity of 5.7 x 10<sup>30</sup> meters per
second) has the greatest distance between the two photon spheres. <p>
Feh!  Enough of the photon spheres.
<a name="ergosphere"><h1>The Ergosphere</h1>
The ergosphere is not a photon sphere, nor is it an event horizon.  It's
something very special to rotating black holes.  Firstly, what does it
look like?  It is a solid ellipsoid (a 3D ellipse) that billows out from
the black hole <i>above the outer event horizon</i>.  The faster the black
hole rotates, the further it billows.  This is unusual cuz it's the first
thing I've mentioned that is not just a radius, it is, in fact, a region.
The photon spheres and event horizons are just distances, after all; but
not the ergosphere.  By the by, the most the ergosphere can billow out is
when its radius (along the axis of rotation) is 1/2 R<sub>s</sub>. 
<p>
The outer boundary of the ergosphere is the static limit of the rotating
black hole.  What's a static limit?  It's where you can no longer stay
still, even if you were going at the speed of light.  For static black
holes the static limit is the event horizon, since after you cross that,
even if you go the speed of light, you are pulled towards the singularity.
A rotating black hole is different from the other two (once again!) in
that its static limit is above its outer event horizon.
<p>
This is all very nice, but what does it mean?!  It means that once you
cross into the ergosphere, it is impossible to stay still.  Even light
rays are dragged along in the direction of rotation.  However, you can
enter and leave this region whenever you like, unlike the
abandon-all-hope-ye-who-enter-here static limit/event horizon of the other
two black holes.  You can merrily weave in and out of the ergosphere with
no nasty side-effects.  It's a place of quirky spacetime of the black hole
that we can actually visit and leave.
<p>
<a name="horizons"><h1>Familiar Horizons</h1>
The two event horizons of the rotating black hole are pretty much the same
as a <a href="charged.html#horizons">charged black hole's event
horizons</a>: two radii where a distant observer would say time
seems to stop. The outer horizon switches time and space around one way,
and the inner horizon flips 'em back to how they are in the real world.
Oh, I didn't explain that stuff when I talked about charged black holes,
right?  It's pretty complicated and it's easier to understand if you know
how to read <a href="spacetime.html">spacetime diagrams</a>.  I go into
detail in the <a href="inside.html">Inside 'em</a> section.
<p>
Briefly, we normally go about life moving around as we please in space but
being inexorably dragged by time.  Whenever you cross any event horizon,
those two things...flip.  That's why I edged <i>a lot</i> when I mentioned
the singularity.  Due to this flipping, it is not a point in space; it's a
time.  After a certain <i>time</i> after you cross a static black hole's
event horizon, what's left of you might survive to encounter the
singularity. What about charged and rotating black holes and their two
horizons?  That's what
make's 'em special.  When you cross the second horizon, space and time
flip back to what we're used to experiencing and the singularity becomes a
place in space and entirely possible to avoid.  Back to the topic at hand!
<p>
The rotating black hole has an outer and an inner event horizon.  They
each move closer to one another the more angular velocity the black hole
has.  When the speed of the black hole's rotation equals its mass, the two
event horizons merge into one.  When you cross this, you don't even bat an
eyelash because there is no flipping of space and time <i>at all</i>.
Should the black hole spin faster than that, both horizons disappear and
leave the exposed singularity.  Everyone calls this a naked singularity
so often that I've sworn off using the term completely.
<p>
<a name="singularity"><h1>Ring around the Singularity</h1>
Well, that's not entirely accurate.  The singularity <i>is</i> a ring, you
see.  Calculations using Kerr geometry describe the singularity as
ring-shaped.  That's a curious concept.  It's also much more complicated
than that!  I go into detail about singularities in the <a
href="inside.html">Inside 'em</a> section for a reason---I want to keep
all the wackiness in one place.  Still, ring singularities are just so
neat that I can't contain myself.
<p>
You already know that a traveler can move about quite freely after
crossing the inner event horizon.  Space and time are in their usual
places.  What you don't know is that you actually have to make an effort
to hit the singularity of a rotating black hole!  If you approach it from
any angle other than equatorial, you go...(ahem)...well, you don't hit the
singularity.  You could turn around and leave the black hole.  Sure,
you'll emerge way in the future of your own universe, but, considering
that the nearest black hole is many many light years away, you'll probably
have expected <i>some</i> time dialation from your method of getting to
the darned thing in the first place. Where you go if you point
yourself towards to singularity depends on who you talk to.  Some
physicists like to call it 'negative space.'  Others (myself included)
like to call it another universe or another part of this universe.
<p>
You could just sit there and admire the view.  The singularity would
appear like an oval window.  If you looked at it from the axis of
rotation, it would be a circular window.  The closer you got to the
equator, the more oval the window would seem.  At the equator, you would
only see the singularity.  But...what would the oval window <a
href="inside.html#ringsingularity">show you?</a>
