      <p>My visit to Midwest Outfitters started with a flight from Harrisburg, 
        Pa to St. Louis, Mo followed by a short connecting flight to Burlington, 
        Iowa. Once in Burlington the drive to camp was about an hour. This was 
        my first time visiting the state of Iowa. After knowing the reputation 
        this state has for trophy whitetails I was anxious to see the terrain. 
        The countryside was made up of rolling hills with many agricultural fields. 
        Surrounding these fields were a combination of large and small patches 
        of wooded areas. Also a lot of CRP land exists in Iowa. This is land in 
        which the government pays the landowner to leave a portion un-touched 
        and left to grow naturally. These areas end up being covered with high 
        grass and dense under-growth. All these factors combine to make the perfect 
        hiding area for the Trophy Whitetail.<font color="#FFCC66"> </font></p>
      <p>Rodney Hughes is the owner and operator of Midwest USA Outfitters. As 
        we made the drive from Burlington to his hunting camp I asked him many 
        questions about his hunting operation. Midwest Outfitters began in 1997. 
        Currently through leases, Rodney has exclusive hunting rights to over 
        4000 acres. This land spans several different farms. Hunting is done from 
        lock on tree stands. Currently there are approximately 25 tree stands 
        placed through out these farms. </p>
      <p>Rodney plans on accommodating 8 -10 hunters the first shotgun season, 
        6 - 7 hunters the second shotgun season, and 2 - 3 hunters for muzzleloader 
        season. Accurately predicting the number of hunters though is a little 
        difficult. Drawing a deer tag in Iowa is difficult. I was lucky enough 
        to draw a shotgun tag for the second season on my first try. Most hunters 
        however do not draw a tag on their first year, but then through the use 
        of a preference point they are pretty much guaranteed to draw a tag in 
        the second year. The difficulty in drawing a tag applies to both gun and 
        archery hunters. As a result you will need to plan 2 years in advance 
        to book with Rodney.</p>
      <p>Once you do draw a tag though, I am sure you will be impressed with Rodney's 
        hunting operation. Once we arrived in camp I was amazed at the number 
        of large bucks taken in such a small area. Also, a statistic that was 
        equally impressive to me is that more 150 plus class whitetails are taken 
        in Iowa each year than in all the Canadian Provinces combined. For the 
        archery enthusiast, Midwest Outfitters can be especially enjoyable. The 
        archery season here coincides with the rut. Seeing several 150 class and 
        higher bucks in a 5 day hunt usually the norm. However, keep in mind these 
        bucks are not stupid so harvesting an animal of this quality with a bow 
        will depend largely on your skill level as a hunter.</p>

      <p>Rodney caters to the serious hunter. Gun hunters need to be prepared 
        to spend 10 hours on strand for the first few days of the hunt. Due to 
        the make-up of the land being several adjoining farms deer travel can 
        occur anytime through out the day. A few days into the hunt Rodney and 
        his staff will put on limited drives in an effort to get deer moving. 
        Archery hunters also need to be prepared for several hours on stand. Since 
        the rut is usually on during this season bucks can be chasing does at 
        any time. </p>
      <p>The first day of my hunt was on a Saturday, 12/08. Rodney knocked on 
        the door of my room at 5:30 AM. All meals are served buffet style in a 
        very comfortable restaurant type atmosphere. Breakfast is continental, 
        with an assortment of cereals, donuts, juices, and coffee. Each evening 
        you fill out an order form for the specific type of lunch sandwiches that 
        you want. At breakfast a packed lunch with your name on your bag is ready 
        and waiting. Evening meals included roast beef, chicken, ribs, lasagna, 
        and pork loins. When you combine this with fresh baked desserts, don't 
        plan on losing any weight while you hunt with Midwest Outfitters.</p>
      <p> I arrived at my stand about 20 minutes before daylight. My stand was 
        placed in a patch of woods that was several hundred yards long. My particular 
        stand overlooked a small hollow and a creek bed. It didn't take long for 
        deer to start appearing. About 20 minutes after first light I saw a group 
        of 4 doe and a 4-point buck. As the morning continued deer steadily moved 
        by my stand. Many were within shooting distance. In the afternoon things 
        slowed a bit, but I still continued to see deer. As evening approached 
        I was considering moving from my stand and watching over a field edge 
        that contained several fresh tracks and seemed to serve as a natural crossing 
        area. Just as I was ready to pack up and sneak to this spot, 2 more doe 
        appeared in front of my stand. They were just feeding naturally 15 yards 
        in front of me. I decided it would be best just to stay put, not spook 
        these deer and maybe a shooter buck would appear. As my luck would have 
        it, no shooter buck would show up. After darkness fell I made my way out 
        to be picked up. Rodney was waiting for me in the truck. My heart sank 
        as he told me that 15 minutes before dark 3 bucks appeared with one of 
        these bucks approaching 150 class. All this occurred at the exact crossing 
        I was planning to watch. The first day I ended up seeing 25 deer, 20 doe 
        and 5 bucks. All the bucks were year and a half old 4 and 6 pointers.</p>
      <p>The second morning we decided the best strategy would be to return to 
        the same place. The weather warmed up, and the deer sightings fell off. 
        I only managed to see 2 does the second day. The third day I went to a 
        different farm. It was a much larger wooded area with lots of deer sign. 
        The weather stayed warm however and the deer held tight, I only managed 
        to see 2 does. The fourth day of the hunt took me to another new area. 
        The weather cooled a little bit, but was still 30 degrees above the normal 
        December temperatures for Iowa. I saw 8 deer, 6 doe and two 6-point bucks.</p>

      <p>As we sat around the lodge before the last evening of the hunt Rodney 
        indicated we would try putting on some drives the last day of the hunt. 
        He was disappointed that we hadn't been seeing more deer and any shooter 
        bucks. This area has so much potential for trophy whitetails. You can 
        see this by the first photo above. These 4 bucks were taken before 9:00 
        AM on opening morning of this years hunt. Mother Nature just would not 
        cooperate with us however. As any experienced whitetail hunter can confess 
        to, anytime temperatures warm to 30 degrees above normal, deer activity, 
        especially trophy buck deer activity will go down. As I talked to the 
        other two other hunters in camp I was very surprised we were able to sight 
        the number of deer that we did. Between the three of us, in the first 
        four days of hunting we still managed to see 147 deer, with 14 of those 
        being bucks. All things considered I felt this was pretty good. </p>

      <p>On the last day Rodney and his staff put on several drives. Each drive 
        produced deer but still no shooter bucks. It was 3:00 and we only had 
        an hour of daylight remaining. Rodney was determined to give us every 
        possible opportunity to take a buck. They walked several miles that day 
        trying to push deer to us. Most outfitters would have given up at that 
        point. With the fog rolling in and darkness getting ready to set, Rodney 
        positioned us on the edge of a high grass field while he and the guides 
        pushed a small fencerow and drainage area. It was kind of odd; of all 
        the places we hunted this to me looked like the least likely to produce 
        a shooter buck. Sure enough though, within 10 minutes of the drive starting, 
        a mature 8-point buck began to sneak out of the drainage area right toward 
        us. We were positioned perfectly, having the escape route of the buck 
        completely blocked. Butch, one of the other 2 hunters in camp with me, 
        ended up making a nice shot to take the buck pictured above. Rodney's 
        persistence sure did pay off.</p>
      <p>In summarizing my trip. I think you will find Midwest Outfitters a very 
        enjoyable hunt. There is definitely trophy buck potential here. It is 
        a serious hunt though, for serious hunters. If you are looking to hunt 
        the famous Van Buren County for trophy whitetails be sure to give Rodney 
        a call. Turkey hunting in Iowa is also some of the finest you will find 
        anywhere in the country. Each day on stand I could have easily taken a 
        turkey, and this was without any aid of a call. This season, 24 hunters 
        took 33 birds. This is possible because Rodney has leased hunting ground 
        in Missouri as well as Iowa. <br>
