					<h3>1 - 10 von 181</h3><p><strong><a href="/en/news/4036">Adult Stem Cells show Pluripotency in Animal Experiments</a></strong><br />A research group from Minnesota came to the results using animal experiments, that certain mesenchymal stem cells from adult bone marrow show pluripotency. These multipotent adult stem cells (abbreviated MAPC) differentiate not only into mesenchymal cells, which they were programmed to do, but also into other somatic cell types. The prerequistite for this is that adult stem cell at an early stage of development (blastocyst stage) are injected. <strong>2002-07-08</strong></p><p><strong><a href="/en/news/4037">Science: GMO may posses a great potential to displace naturally occuring species</a></strong><br />US scientists from the University of Purdue showed in a risk analysis project, that the release of genetically modified organisms (GMO) carries a large theoretical risk of displacing the naturally occuring populations.
 <strong>2002-07-08</strong></p><p><strong><a href="/en/news/4035">Switzerland: National Ethics Commission (NEC) Published Statement Regarding Research on Embryonal Stem Cells</a></strong><br />The National Ethics Commission for Human Medicine presented their statement regarding research on embryonal stem cells on 18 June 2002. There is much concordandce between the contents of the statement and the government bill, which is currently undergoing public consultation. <strong>2002-07-08</strong></p><p><strong><a href="/en/news/4038">Switzerland: Strengthening adult stem cell research through the Swiss National Science Foundation</a></strong><br />The National Research Project 46 (NFP 46) is supporting new projects within the framework of the NFP "Implantations and Transplantations" with 3.5 million Swiss Francs.
With a second tender, the National Research Foundation Program "Implantations and Transplantations" is strenthening the research on cord blood and adult stem cells, on biological implants as well as on natural tissue tolerance. For new projects in this field, there are 3.5 million Swiss Francs available. 
 <strong>2002-07-08</strong></p><p><strong><a href="/en/news/4034">World Food Summit: GM Food Research Could Combat Hunger</a></strong><br />The World Food Summit of the United Nations (FAO) took place in Rome from June 10 – 13, 2002. After controversial discussions, it was agreed upon with the closing statement, that the Green Gene Technology could help improve the problem of undernourishment.
 <strong>2002-07-08</strong></p><p><strong><a href="/en/news/4016">Study on Adverse Environmental Impacts of Genetically Modified Cotton – Denied by Monsanto</a></strong><br />According to a Chinese study, the use of genetically modified cotton in China has adverse environmental impacts. These plants, equipped with an insecticide, are disrupting the natural balance in the insect world.
 <strong>2002-06-18</strong></p><p><strong><a href="/en/news/4015">Swiss National Science Foundation Celebrates 50th Anniversary</a></strong><br />On 1 August 2002 the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) will celebrate it’s 50th anniversiary. A festschrift will be published for the occasion which highlights milestones of Swiss research over the last 50 years and gives a brief history of the SNSF.  <strong>2002-06-18</strong></p><p><strong><a href="/en/news/4014">Switzerland: Five-Year Moratorium for GMO in Agriculture</a></strong><br />During the next five years, no genetically modified organisms (GMO) should be allowed to be released in agriculture. This moratorium was decided with 13 to 12 votes by the Committee for Science, Education and Culture (CSEC) of the Federal Council.
 <strong>2002-06-18</strong></p><p><strong><a href="/en/news/4004">Research: Snake Poisons as Models for New Coagulation Inhibitors</a></strong><br />With the help of snake poisons, researchers in Bern are investigating thrombocytes, which play a central role in building dangerous blood clots. A long-term goal is the development of specific medications which do not interfere with the blood coagulati-on system.
 <strong>2002-06-11</strong></p><p><strong><a href="/en/news/4003">Switzerland: Stem Cell Symposium on Medicine, Ethics and Legislation</a></strong><br />The symposium, which took place May 30th at the Gynecology Hospital of the Uni-versity of Basel, dealt with questions on stem cell research. Approximately one hundred participants attended lectures and discussions regarding current and future stem cell research. At the end of the symposium, a public forum was held.
