<P>SQL is hard to troubleshoot because it's relatively monolithic, unlike
modern modular OOP languages. Thus it's often hard to divide a SQL statement
into sections. I don't claim to be an SQL guru, but here are some tips
that have helped me in the past. Note that many SQL problems fall into
one of these categories:</P>

<P><A HREF="lsql.htm#trashes_database">Statement trashes the database<BR>
Statement takes forever<BR>
</A><A HREF="lsql.htm#much_too_long">Statement takes much too long<BR>
</A><A HREF="lsql.htm#no_results">Statement erroneously fails to bring
back results<BR>
</A><A HREF="lsql.htm#wrong_results">Statement returns the wrong results</A></P>

<H2>General SQL troubleshooting tips</H2>

<P>Build tiny test queries to test the SQL in parts.<BR>
Test subqueries first.<BR>
Comment liberally.<BR>
If it's a trigger or stored procedure, be sure to install each change before
testing.<BR>
It's often easier to test triggers/stored procedures live in ISQL (or whatever).<BR>
If possible, have an up-to-date, full-sized test database on another server
for testing.</P>

<H2><A NAME="trashes_database"></A>Statement trashes database or takes
forever:</H2>

<P>These are often the same thing since terminating the database connection
often trashes the database. This is one of the rare cases when you'd prefer
not to reproduce the symptom. Luckily, you can build the statement from
scratch, one step at a time, evaluating each step to see if it will cause
problems. This evaluation should include a check to make sure any lookup
is either on a key field, or on a tiny table. It should also include a
theoretical check for those multiplicative joins that produce unwieldy
result sets. I build in this sequence, and test after each modification:</P>

<OL>
<LI>The core result set producing statement, without any relational lookups,
computed fields, and if possible subqueries.</LI>

<LI>Separately test any subqueries to make sure they work the way you think
they will.</LI>

<LI>Install the subqueries.</LI>

<LI>Install lookups one at a time.</LI>

<LI>Install computed fields.</LI>
</OL>

<H2><A NAME="much_too_long"></A>Statement takes much too long:</H2>

<P>One way to handle this is to <A HREF="lsql.htm#trashes_database">treat
it like it takes forever</A>. Alternately, you can do a bottleneck analysis.
Start with the general maintenance procedure of making sure every join
and lookup accesses its table by a key (unless the table is tiny). Then
comment out parts of the SQL statement using /* */. When you can toggle
the exessive delay by commenting out and in a particular section of the
SQL, see what's wrong with that section. You may need to run that section
it separately using ISQL or whatever.</P>

<H2><A NAME="no_results"></A>Statement erroneously fails to bring back
results:</H2>

<P>Usually caused by a join/lookup finding nothing. Take out lookups and
try again. If that eliminates the symptom, narrow the cause to the specific
lookup. If it doesn't, look at the logic of the underlying query.</P>

<H2><A NAME="wrong_results"></A>Statement returns wrong results:</H2>

<P>It's often best to start with the logic of the underlying query. Write
it in English. Then make a SQL statement (no lookups or stored procedures)
to return the correct results. If the problem with the original SQL is
immediately obvious, just fix and test the original. Otherwise, add the
lookups and computed fields a step at a time, testing along the way. Fix
problems as they occur. Once you have a complete, working SQL statement,
see where it differs from the original. It's important to figure why the
problem happened so you can quickly solve similar problems later. Lastly,
fix the original or replace it with the one you built up.</P>
