<h3> Abstract </h3>
</center>

Motivation: We developed GeneGenerator because of
the need for a tool to predict gene structure without
knowing in advance how to score potential exons and
introns in order to obtain the best results, pertinent in
particular to less well-studied organisms for which
suitable training sets are small. GeneGenerator is a
very flexible algorithm which for a given genomic
sequence generates a number of feasible gene
structures satisfying user-defined constraints. The
specific implementation described in detail requires
minimum scoring for translation start and donor and
acceptor splice sites according to previously trained
logitlinear models. In addition, potential exons and
introns are required to exceed specified minimal
lengths and threshold scores for coding or non-coding
potential derived as log-likelihood ratios of appropriate
Markov sequence models. 

<p>

Results: A database of 46 non-redundant genomic
sequences from maize is used for illustration. It is
shown that the correct gene structures do not always
maximize the considered target function. However, in
most cases, the correct or nearly correct structures are
found in a small set of high-scoring structures. A
critical review of the generated structures sometimes
allows the choices to be narrowed by considering
additional variables such as predicted splice site
strength or local optimality of splice site scores.
Summary statistics for prediction accuracy over all 46
maize genes are derived under cross-validation and
non-cross-validation training conditions for the
Markov sequence models. The algorithm achieved
exon sensitivity of 0.81 and specificity of 0.75 on an
independent set of 14 novel maize genomic segments.

Availability: GeneGenerator runs under
Borland-Pascal 7.0 using MS-DOS and C on UNIX
work stations. The source code is available upon
request.
