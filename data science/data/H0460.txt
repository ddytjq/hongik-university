<h3>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES</H3>

<HR>
                To expand and validate innovative methods for measuring biodegradation rates,
                biotransformation processes, microbial community dynamics, electron flow,
                contaminant distributions, and hydrogeological and geochemical factors -- and to
                understand the implications of these measurements.  The methods developed will
                focus on characterizing, monitoring (for process control), and defining end points
                essential to implementing biodegradation in the field, particularly those methods
                relevant to the transformation of metals and radionuclides.<p>
                <h3>BACKGROUND</H3>
                
                
<HR>
<hr><h4><i>Current methods for measuring and evaluating the
effectiveness of bioremediation are inadequate and, in most cases,
undeveloped.</i></h4><hr>

Understanding the relationships between microbial community dynamics
and the resulting biodegradation and transformation is key to evaluating
and predicting the microbial processes that can be harnessed for
bioremediation.  However, current methods for measuring and evaluating
the effectiveness of bioremediation are inadequate and, in most cases,
undeveloped.  The recently published evaluation by CISB (1993)
suggests that "...demonstrating that <i> in situ </i> bioremediation is
working should include three types of evidence:<p>
<menu>
1.              Document[ed] loss of contaminants from the site,<p>
2.              Laboratory assays showing that microorganisms in site samples
                have the potential to transform the contaminants under expected
                site conditions, and <p>
3.   One or more pieces of evidence showing that the biodegradative potential is
                     actually realized in the field."<p>
                </menu>
                Other appropriate evidence would include documented product accumulation and
                detoxification.  The strongest case is made by having multiple lines of evidence that
                include documentation of electron flow towards bioremediation pathways.<p>
                <hr><h4><i>Techniques that measure the electron flow critical to all the
                bioremediation processes are particularly important.</i></h4><hr>
                
                In today's practice, biological technologies applied during full-scale remediation rely
                on measuring the disappearance of parent compounds and analyzing the status of
                electron acceptors (O<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>3</sub>, and SO<sub>4</sub>), selected
                nutrients, and microbial numbers.  Research is needed to develop measurement tools
                to assess the transformation of complex wastes containing radionuclides and organic
                compounds and to interpret measurements of bioremediation.  Techniques that
                measure the electron flow that is critical to all the bioremediation processes are
                particularly important.  Environmental microbiology uses techniques largely adapted
                from clinical microbiology and chemical techniques designed to measure total
                chemical concentrations.  Although useful, these techniques cannot adequately
                describe the identity, function, physiology, and activity of <i>in situ </i>
                organisms.  Most importantly, populations, communities, and activities involving
                anaerobic environments, mixtures of contaminants, and <i> in situ </i>
                measurements of environmental conditions have not been examined.  DNA probes
                and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify DNA have been used to assess the
                responses of individual biodegradative strains or various genera involved in
                bioremediation processes.  But even these processes are limited when measuring
                community function under stress or competition. <p>
                Current chemical methodologies for assessing contamination rates and residuals are
                labor intensive, expensive, and provide indirect measures of <i>in situ
                </i>processes. They may also inaccurately relate total chemical measurements to
                bioavailability and risk to human health.  This may be true even when the
                concentration of chemicals, e.g., metals, radionuclides, or chemical mixtures such
                as total petroleum hydrocarbons, are above statutory levels as commonly determined
                by analytical chemistry.  Research is needed to determine the short- and long-term
                bioavailability of contaminants to the soil community at the micro and macro level. 
                The limitations of existing techniques are most apparent when interpreting the
                results of end points of bioremediation for human health risk assessment.  Leaching
                and other harsh methods for extracting chemical constituents from the soil for
                analytical determination may not adequately measure availability to human or
                ecological receptors.  Surrogate methods that represent receptors, such as simulated
                gastrointestinal fluids, do exist, but they have not been validated for contaminant
                mixtures or residual environmental concentrations following bioremediation. 
                Surrogate end points such as molecular, genetic, cellular, and other <i>in vitro</i>
                assays also exist, but they have not been validated against whole animal standards
                nor have they been applied to bioremediation.  <p>
                Interference from physical or chemical components in the environment also
                constrains assessment methodologies.  Techniques for documenting the loss of
                contaminants from a site have been confounded by a host of problems, including
                natural geologic heterogeneity, variable and unpredictable distributions of
                contaminants, and the practice of measuring total elemental compositions of soil,
                sediment, or groundwater samples.  Improved methods for detecting the location of
                contaminants, both directly and indirectly, are needed.  Moreover, the influence of
                geologic heterogeneity and contaminant transport processes on the distribution of
                contaminants needs to be better understood so that optimal strategies can be
                developed for locating sampling and monitoring sites.  Improved methods for
                efficiently measuring the chemical form of metals and radionuclides (e.g., redox
                status, complexation, and sorption) are required to more effectively evaluate
                bioremediation potential and document biotransformation processes.<p>
                <h3>APPROACH</H3>
                
                
<HR>
The Assessment element will focus on developing techniques for assessing the
bioremedial activities of individual strains and functional groups within a
community.  It will validate existing and emerging laboratory and field techniques
(diagnostics) and include data quality and utility.  The element will also develop a
suite of reliable, reproducible, timely, and economical monitoring techniques for
evaluating bioremediation under laboratory and field conditions, and will examine
issues in evaluating environmentally acceptable end points for bioremediation.<p>
Solving the technical issues related to measuring, monitoring, and quantifying end
points for bioremediation will require the integration of ecological, chemical,
hydrogeological, geophysical, engineering, and information management disciplines. 
For assessing communities and biodegradation rates of parent compounds and
intermediates, the emphasis must be on techniques that yield information on
activities of consortia or on specific strains of bioremedial groups within the
consortia.  When assessing bioremediation end points, the focus must be on
techniques that accurately reflect the impact on human and environmental health. 
In addition, an emphasis on near-real-time analysis and data acquisition will provide
feedback and support to other program elements on complex reactions in
heterogeneous matrices.<p>
The Assessment element, therefore, will involve efforts at the field research centers
and at appropriate satellite sites and will focus on these four subelements:<p>
<menu>
1.              <b>Structure rate and activity.</b>  Development of quantitative
                techniques for assessing bioremediation indicators relating to community
                structure rates of activity and types of microbial activity. <p>
2.              <b>Geophysical, geochemical, and hydrogeological characterization.
                </b> Development of techniques for measuring the geochemical and
                hydrogeologic factors that influence bioremediation.<p>
3.              <b>Interpretive diagnostics.</b>  Development of innovative diagnostic
                tools for managing and interpreting bioremediation measurement information,
                including fatal-flaw-analysis methods.<p>
4.              <b>Bioremediation end points. </b> Development of surrogate methods
                that accurately reflect the effects of the residual products of bioremediation on
                human and environmental health. <p>
