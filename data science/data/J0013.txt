<P>The NAPCM was extremely distressed to learn of the recent layoffs in the racing industry.  In an effort to help these folks find other employment we have worked out a deal with Race City Resumes, an employment/staffing company for pit crew/team members in the Mooresville area.  This company helps race teams find employees.  If you have recently lost your job in the racing industry, contact Bob Hubner at Race City Resumes and tell him that you were referred by the NAPCM.
