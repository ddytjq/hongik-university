<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are two types of mortgage you can choose:</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Repayment Mortgage</b>:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With this traditional method you repay the Society&#146;s
    loan and the interest on it in equal monthly instalments. Part of each month&#146;s
    repayment covers the interest on the mortgage and the remainder of the repayment reduces
    the capital.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">With this type of mortgage we strongly recommend that you
    arrange a mortgage protection policy which is an inexpensive way to ensure that the
    mortgage is repaid in the event of a borrower&#146;s death. If this is not done your
    dependants will have the burden of repaying the mortgage.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Interest Only Mortgage: </b></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The alternative to a repayment mortgage is the interest
    only method. This allows for only the interest on the loan to be paid, and the capital sum
    borrowed does not decrease. Usually you make a long term investment at the same time as
    taking out the mortgage which may produce a capital sum sufficient to repay the mortgage
    loan. There are various different investments which can be linked to this type of mortgage
    which include:<br>
    <br>
    </font><b><font color="#FF0000">I</font><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman">)
    Endowment</font></b></p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">An endowment policy is the most common form of investment
    which may be linked to a mortgage. Over the life of the loan, you pay a monthly premium
    into an endowment assurance policy, and at the end of the mortgage term the proceeds of
    the policy are used to repay some or all of the loan depending on the final value of your
    policy.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </font><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>ii) Pension</b></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you are self-employed or have a personal pension you
    may wish to elect to link a loan to a pension plan. As tax relief is available on pension
    plan contributions this method may be attractive to those eligible. At the end of the
    mortgage, part of the proceeds of the pension fund is used to repay some or all of the
    loan depending on the final value of your policy. Naturally, this reduces the amount
    available to provide a pension in retirement.<br>
    <br>
    If you choose the interest only method, it is your responsibility to arrange a suitable
    policy or plan. It is also your responsibility to monitor the performance of your
    investment and maintain payment of premiums, to ensure that the proceeds will be adequate
    to repay your mortgage. Should the proceeds be inadequate to repay your mortgage, any
    shortfall will need to be paid from your own resources.&nbsp; You will be able to obtain
    this information from the company with whom you hold the policy or plan, or the advisor
    who arranged your policy or plan for you.&nbsp; You should also consider the fact that
    many investment policies or plans have a low &quot;surrender&quot; value in the early
    years to the extent that the policy value may be less than the premiums paid</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The type of mortgage you select may be a factor in the
    maximum loan the Society will provide you.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b><i>Which type of interest rate
  charging method will suit me best?</i></b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">In addition to the decision on whether to take a repayment
  or an interest only mortgage, you should also consider the variations on how the interest
  is charged.<br>
  <br>
  </font><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Variable Rate Mortgage</b></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">As the name suggests, during the course of the mortgage,
    the interest rate can go up or down. There may be spells of several months when the
    interest rate remains constant, or the rate can change many times over a course of months.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Discounted Rate Mortgage</b></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many mortgage lenders offer a discount off their standard
    variable rate for a period of time. Usually, it is for the first few months or years after
    the mortgage has been taken out. You must remember that when the discount period ends,
    your monthly payments will increase. Some lenders also offer &#145;cashbacks&#146; when a
    specified sum of money is returned to the borrower on completion of the mortgage. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Fixed Rate Mortgage</b></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">From time to time, lenders offer a mortgage where the
    interest rate remains fixed, say, for one to five years, and sometimes longer. When the
    fixed rate term has expired, the interest rate will either change to the current variable
    rate or to a new fixed rate. As with discounted rate mortgages, these type of loans may
    attract high charges for early redemption. The main attraction of a fixed rate mortgage is
    that it provides you with certainty of payments for a period. This makes it ideal for
    budgeting purposes and provides protection against rising interest rates.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
  <br>
  </font><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Cap-And-Collar Mortgage</b></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Cap-and-Collar interest means that the maximum and minimum
    rates of interest which may be charged on the loan for a given term are fixed.</font></p>
