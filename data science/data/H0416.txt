Polyadenylation is the non-templated addition of a 50 to 200 nt chain of polyadenylic acid (polyA). Cleavage must precede polyadenylation.			<li>A <a href="MG2223.html">consensus</a> AAUAAA was found 10-30 nucleotides 5' of the polyA site and a GU rich and/or U rich element 3' of the site. When AATAAA is deleted from the DNA template, no mature mRNA is made. When the signal is changed to AAGAAA (in adenovirus DNA) transcripts are longer than usual. Deletion of other sequences in the vicinity, including the actual 3' cleavage site, results in normal polyadenylation at the original distance from the AAUAAA signal.			<li>Transplacement of parts of the sequence surrounding the polyA site from SV40 DNA into the <a href="MG231.html">adenovirus</a> E1A gene revealed a requirement for both AAUAAA and GU or U-rich signals for efficient mature 3' end formation. <img src="i2341.gif">			<li>A <a href="../MGW4/MG424.html">polyA polymerase</a> has been isolated. In vitro transcripts whose 3' ends are at the 3' cleavage site can be polyadenylated by the enzyme. It will not add polyA tails to in vitro RNA transcripts unless those transcripts contain the region surrounding the residue polyadenylated in in vivo transcripts. When addition does occur, it is not to the 3' end of the RNA. Rather, cleavage occurs, making the normal polyadenylation site available to the enzyme. Both cleavage and polymerase activities appear to be catalyzed by the same enzyme.		</ul>		<center>			<p><a href="#Facts">Facts</a> | <a href="#Interp">Interpretations</a> | <a href="#Info">Further Info.</a> | <a href="#bottom">Other Pages</a></p>		</center>		<h4><a name="Interp"></a>Interpretations</h4>		<ul type="circle">			<li>The AAUAAA signal is sufficient for polyadenylation.			<li>For cleavage, both the AAUAAA and the 3' signal are required.		</ul>		<center>			<p><a href="#Facts">Facts</a> | <a href="#Interp">Interpretations</a> | <a href="#Info">Further Info.</a> | <a href="#bottom">Other Pages</a><br>			</p>		</center>		<h4><a name="Info"></a>Further information</h4>		<ul type="square">			<li>One recognition site can have several adenylation sites. In the adenovirus E3 mRNA polyadenylated sites are 17, 26 or 29 nucleotides beyond AATAAA. Where several alternative polyadenylation sites are found, preference is governed by a third sequence element upstream of AAUAAA.			<li>PolyA tails are thought to function in <a href="MG237.html">mRNA stability</a> and in <a href="MG243.html">initiation</a> of translation.			<li>The formation of proper 3' ends that are polyadenylated is important. For some individuals with <a href="MG2413.html">hemoglobin deficiencies</a>, the defects were traced to mutations in the AATAAA sequence.			<li>Cleavage/polyadenylation signals vary in their efficiency. Functioning of low efficiency signals depends on the concentrations of the protein factors. In cells with low concentrations, the low efficiency site is not used. Instead, a downstream higher efficiency site is used. In cells with high concentrations, the high efficiency site is used. This difference is used in the switching of immune system cells from the synthesis of membrane-bound <a href="../MGW3/MG3243.html">IgM</a> to the synthesis of secreted IgM. That switch results from the presence of two membrane-specific exons between the two signals (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=10520989&dopt=Abstract">ref</a>).			<li><a href="../MGW1/MG11226.html">Histone</a> mRNAs are not polyadenylated. Their 3' cleavage requires, 5' of the cleavage site, a hairpin following an ACCA sequence and a CAAGAAAGA sequence in the 3' flanking region. The U7 snRNP is required for this maturation.			<li>SnRNAs U1 to U5 and U7 are transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Their 3' end formation, which may be coincident with RNA polymerase termination, requires a 3' flanking GTTTAAANNNAGA signal. The processing of yeast pre mRNA differs from that in other organisms.			<li><a href="MG232.html">Cleavage</a> is required also in the processing of non mRNAs. 3'end formation for <a href="MG2322.html">tRNAs</a> proceeds by a different pathway. <img src="nav4.gif" width="69" height="71" align="right" usemap="#nav4B1F889C9"><map name=""></map>			<li>A nucleotide, or nucleotides, is added to the <a href="MG233.html">5' end</a> of mRNAs.
