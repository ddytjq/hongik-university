<b>The importance of independence</b><p>

<b>As independent Insurance Brokers, we are legally obliged to provide truly independent advice to our customers. This is called ''best advice.'' Sometimes, we might actually advise you that it wouldn't be in your interests to change your current insurance arrangements - for example, if penalty charges would be incurred - and to wait until your next renewal date before taking action. <p>

Because of our independent status, we will always base our advice on what's best for you, rather than what's best for us. Certainly, not all our advice results in us selling a policy. As truly independent brokers, NOR SHOULD IT. </b><p>
