<div class="mainheader">What is the Nature of Space and Time?</div>

<p><table align="right"><tr><td><img src="/images/blackhole.jpg" border="0" alt="Black Hole Simulation"></td></tr></table>In the infinitude of space there lies vast galaxy chains, strung like pearls on threads of dark matter... a world dictated by the ebb and flow of gravity and a mysterious, newly detected force called dark energy.</p>

<p>In the realm of the atom, exotic subatomic particles burst in and out of existence and quantum forces dictate the dance of electrons and the flow of energy.</p>

<p>Patterns are emerging in the study of the infinite and the infinitesimal.  Many physicists now believe that all forces -- those that bind the atom and those that bind the Universe -- may be different aspects of the same phenomenon.  Through Albert Einstein's famous E=MC<sup>2</sup> equation, we know that matter and energy are interchangeable, one in the same.  Can we find a connection between other aspects of space and time?</p>  

<p>Cosmic Journeys is the quest to understand the true nature of the Universe and all its contents.  Step one is to investigate gravity.</p>

<p><b><i>What is gravity?</i></b>  This simple question baffles scientists.  On a basic level, gravity is the force that keeps us pinned to the Earth.  Gravity is the reason why the scoop of ice cream falls off the cone if you're not too careful.  Yet what is this force?  Is it like magnetic forces?  Is this the same force that holds atoms together?  Understanding the nature of space and time entails understanding gravity.</p>

<p>Einstein described gravity in an innovative way in his Theory of General Relativity, which he published in 1915.  Einstein said that gravity was the result of mass distorting the fabric of space, a four-dimensional realm that includes the three physical dimensions (length, width, height) and the dimension of time.  Imagine a bowling ball on a bed.  This heavy object (lots of mass) creates a little well in the bed.  A tiny marble on the bed, if it is close enough to the bowling ball, will roll down next to it.  You can give the marble a little push away from the bowling ball, but it will roll back.</p>

<p>Now step back... way back.  The Earth is like a bowling ball in space and we are like the marbles.  We can try to jump away from the Earth, but we always fall back.  We need lots of energy to break away from the Earth's pull -- the kind of energy produced by a rocket.</p>

<p>Things get really strange around a black hole, a source of extreme gravity.  Black holes are collapsed stars or collapsed pockets of gas.  They compress great quantities of matter into a single point, called a singularity.  Black holes have no surface.  They are just a point.  They have a theoretical border called an event horizon.  Anything that crosses that border, matter or light, can never cross back.  Everything beyond the event horizon falls into that central point of singularity.</p>

<p>Black holes, with their extreme gravity, warp spacetime.  Talk about a bowling ball!  Not only does matter fall into a black hole, if it's close enough, but a beam of light will bend as it passes near the black hole and time will actually slow down.</p>

<p>The distortion of time, matter, and light are all predicted by General Relativity.  Scientists have actually seen these effects.  Gas falling into black holes gets so hot that it emits X-rays, which is a type of light far more energetic than the visible light our eyes can detect.  As this light travels away from the black hole (it can escape because it never crossed that event horizon), the black hole's gravity tugs at it from behind, stretching it backwards.  The effect is called gravitational redshifting.  Also, a beam of light far beyond the black hole will bend as it passes a black hole, changing from a straight to an arched path.  Can you imagine a flashlight that makes an arched beam?</p>

<p>Most amazingly, time, as we comprehend it, comes to a standstill at the event horizon or as matter approaches the speed of light.  Scientists have seen this too.  One example is the muon, a subatomic particle.  These particles are created when cosmic rays from space smash into the Earth's atmosphere.  Muons don't exist for long; they decay into electrons and neutrinos in about two microseconds.  Yet scientists can detect muons on Earth's surface that were created at the top of the atmosphere.  This is because the muons can move at near light speed.  Their clocks, their own internal sense of time, slow down.  Instead of decaying in two microseconds, muons live for several seconds or longer, depending on how fast they can move.</p>

<p>General Relativity is also called the theory of gravity.  This theory describes the way energy and matter behave over large scales -- from seemingly infinite chains of galaxies to, really, just about anything bigger than an atom.  Once you get to the atomic scale, quantum forces take over.  The atom is defined by Quantum Theory.</p>

<p>General Relativity cannot explain the atom, and Quantum Theory cannot explain the Universe at large.  The two theories work well in their own realms, but they are incompatible with each other.  The ultimate goal among physicists is to combine both theories into a Theory of Everything.  As we understand more about the nature of space and time, we move closer to a breakthrough.</p>

<p>Scientists know of four fundamental forces; there's gravity and the three quantum forces:  electromagnetism (light), strong forces (the glue holding protons together), and weak forces (seen in radioactivity).  Gravity, believe it or not, is the weakest of these forces.  Birds fly; basketball players seem to defy gravity.  It isn't so hard to break free from gravity for a few seconds.  Just try pulling a proton apart, though.  Nuclear fission, breaking larger atoms into smaller ones, is the source of great power.</p>

<p>Gravity is the oddball force.  The quantum forces each have a particle that transmits that force.  Electromagnetism has the photon, a particle of light.  Strong forces have gluons.  Weak forces have Z and W particles.  There is a theorized gravity particle called the graviton.  Finding the graviton in nature would help bridge the gap between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.  Cosmic Journeys may find the first clues of quantum gravity, as we shall see below.</p>

<p>All of the fundamental forces may have been united and indistinguishable at the moment of the Big Bang.  Scientists have already found that electromagnetism and weak forces are one in the same at very high energies, the kind of energies associated with 10<sup>-10</sup> second after the Big Bang, when the budding Universe was incredibly hot and dense.  Physicists used particle accelerators, so-called atom smashers, to attain this energy level and establish the "electro-weak" theory.</p>  

<p>Strong forces may also be tied into the electro-weak at even higher energies.  That's the next step, to establish a Grand Unified Theory, or GUT, of the three quantum forces.  The energies needed are far beyond the reach of particle accelerators, comparable to those energies seen at 10<sup>-35</sup> second after the Big Bang.  All is not lost, though.  We may be able to witness these energies in space... today!</p>

<p>One Cosmic Journeys mission, called <a href="http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/gamcosray/hecr/owl_new.html" title="OWL">OWL</a>, will collect the highest energy cosmic rays, atomic-size particles of matter moving at near light speed.  These particles, which constantly bombard the Earth, defy the current laws of physics.  Their energies are just too high; no known mechanism can produce them.  One theory is that these cosmic rays are produced relatively nearby in space by topological defects, folds in spacetime.  These defects, the theory states, would have an energy level comparable to the infant Universe at 10<sup>-35</sup> second, the so-called GUT era.  OWL may be our first journey into the GUT era, providing the clues to unite quantum forces.</p>

<p>Can we fold gravity into GUT?  This is very speculative.  One of the proposed theories to do this is called the Superstring theory, which would essentially be the long-sought Theory of Everything.  The energies to unite gravity with other forces may have existed at "Planck time," 10<sup>-44</sup> second after the Big Bang.  Scientists do not know of any method -- that is, any experiment or space mission -- that could investigate Superstring theory.</p>

<p>But once again, all is not lost.  Step by step, your mother told you.  Scientists are now trying to understand gravity and its relation to the other forces by putting General Relativity to the test.  Did Einstein have the last word on gravity?  He certainly gave us a good starting point.</p>

<p>Several <a href="/docs/missions/missions.html" title="Cosomic Journeys missions">Cosmic Journeys missions</a> will test General Relativity where gravity is the strongest, at the black hole event horizon.</p>  

<p>General Relativity applies to all massive objects, not just black holes.  All matter has mass, and all mass distorts spacetime.  Here's a good example of General Relativity's usefulness.  The physics of Isaac Newton was instrumental in determining the orbits of the planets.  Newtonian physics, however, couldn't quite account for the orbit of Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun.  Calculations were off by a few feet.</p>  

<p>What Newton didn't account for was the fact that the Sun, quite massive in its own right, is distorting spacetime and rotating the fabric of space along with the planets.  Mercury is the closest, so it feels the effect the most.  It is as if the planets are orbiting on a moving walkway.  Gravity from the rotating sun pulls along spacetime, and Mercury gets a free ride... about six feet every rotation.  Imagine that bowling ball on the bed pulling at the sheets.  General Relativity could account for this, providing a fine-tuning of Newtonian physics.</p>

<p>Sure, a few feet isn't much.  Near a black hole, though, the effects of General Relativity are greater.  Yet we see that Newtonian physics breaks down when we zoom in on Mercury.  Will Einstein's physics break down at the border of a black hole?  That's what Cosmic Journeys aims to find out.</p>

<p><a href="http://constellation.gsfc.nasa.gov/" title="Constellation-X">Constellation-X</a> is one mission that will zoom in on black hole event horizons.  Constellation-X will have the resolution necessary to follow the path of gas as it makes that final plunge across the border.  Just as optical telescopes scrutinized Mercury's orbit and measured it to the foot to see if it held up to Newton's equations, the fantastic X-ray telescope will scrutinize the flow of gas into a black hole to see if it holds up to Einstein's equations.</p>  

<p>The <a href="http://lisa.jpl.nasa.gov" title="LISA">LISA</a> mission will test yet another extraordinary prediction of General Relativity -- that gravity propagates in waves at light speed.  These would be ripples in spacetime.  LISA will comprise three satellites floating in the sea of space, "buoyed" by connecting lasers.  When a gravity wave passes, one spacecraft would move, then the next.</p>  

<p>If LISA detects gravity waves, this would open an entirely new window to the Universe, comparable to light with all its varying wavelengths.  Unlike light, though, gravity waves wouldn't be blocked by dust and gas.  This means gravity waves could penetrate dusty galaxy core that obscure light, sort of like shining through walls.</p>

<p>Gravity waves could form when massive, spinning objects collide.  This could be mergers of neutron stars and black holes of all sizes.  Even star explosions could make detectable gravity waves.  Each merger would have a set wave frequency.  A mission to follow LISA, once scientists have a better understanding of gravity waves, could detect the rumblings of the Big Bang itself, a gravitational wave background lingering from the moment of creation.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://glast.gsfc.nasa.gov/" title="GLAST">GLAST</a> mission, which observes gamma rays, may be the first to detect quantum gravity.  Quantum gravity predicts that gravity will slow down higher-energy photons more than lower-energy photons.  Remember, mass is energy.  Although photons are particles of light, the higher-energy ones will have a greater gravitational potential, as if they were heavier than lower-energy photons.</p>  

<p>The effects of quantum gravity can only be seen over great distances at extremely high energies.  This is right up GLAST's alley.  Gamma-ray bursts are the most powerful explosions in the Universe, second only to the Big Bang.  They also come from cosmological, or extremely far, distances.  Therefore, GLAST may see gamma-ray bursts that have traveled so far that the highest-energy photons are arriving at Earth fractions of a second slower than lower-energy photons from that burst.</p>

<p>Step by step, the Cosmic Journeys missions will chip away at the underlying physics of gravity to reveal the essence of space, time and energy.</p>
