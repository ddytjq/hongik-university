<LI>F1 - FIAT SELLS 34% OF FERRARI</a><br>
Fancy a piece of Ferrari? You soon may get a chance, now that automotive conglomerate Fiat has sold off a 34 percent stake in the company to an investment bank, which reportedly plans to float the shares on the stock market next year. 

The move was not unexpected for struggling Fiat, which will receive a much-needed infusion of cash from the deal with Mediobanca, said to be worth some $750m. According to Britain’s Financial Times newspaper, Mediobanca already has placed 12.5 percent of Ferrari with a syndicate of investors and is in talks for another eight percent, while the remainder will be floated in the first half of 2003. 

The share sale is not expected to have any immediate effect on Ferrari's Formula 1 team, which remains Ferrari’s most prominent form of advertising around the world.

<LI>F1 - REVISED JAG CAR STILL SLOW</a><br>
Jaguar's revised version of its R3 F1 car made its public debut yesterday in testing at the Spanish Grand Prix circuit of Barcelona, but its initial results failed to deliver the boost that driver Eddie Irvine had expressed hopes for earlier in the week. Irvine was the slowest of the nine drivers present in Barcelona on Thursday, day, lapping some 2sec slower than the pace-setting McLaren/Mercedes—and he set that time in the old Jaguar.

<li>F1 - MINARDI WILL RECEIVE MONEY BUT MAY LOSE ENGINES FOR 2003</a><br>
European Minardi’s determination to see out the 2002 season was bolstered when Bernie Ecclestone reportedly agreed to pay the team the $12m in travel fund money it claims it is owed from last season. However, some other F1 team owners continue to maintain that Minardi has no right to the money—which was earned by the defunct Prost GP team whose championship ranking Minardi has assumed this season by default—and may take the matter to arbitration. 

Meanwhile, the team may have another crisis brewing on the horizon, as engine supplier and technical partner Asiatech is considering a "sabbatical" from Formula 1 next year. The company's commercial director, John Gano, told Autosport that Asiatech is focusing on securing a partnership with a major automotive manufacturer for 2004, and that a year off from F1 could assist this process. Gano says that Asiatech has ambitions to build its own chassis as well as engines, creating a package that could then be offered to a manufacturer to badge. 

"We want to create a platform for a car manufacturer to enter Grand Prix racing in a most efficient way," Gano said. "We now have the knowledge to build both a chassis and an engine, but without a car company's support there is no prospect of winning in the long run. So, we are in need of such a partner." 

Losing Asiatech would appear to leave Cosworth as the most like alternate power source for Minardi; but even assuming the team could come up with the money required to pay for them, Jaguar Racing boss Niki Lauda says that both Arrows and Jordan (rumored to be losing its Honda supply) have talked with Cosworth about an engine deal for next year.

<li>CART - SIGMA AND PAPIS WILL MISS CHICAGO RACE</a><br>
It ain’t over ’til it’s over, but all signs point to Sigma Autosport missing its home race this weekend in the CART Grand Prix of Chicago. The financially strapped team was on hand at Portland two weeks ago, but driver Max Papis was unable to compete owing to the team’s overdue bills at Cosworth, PI Research and Bridgestone. 

Telephone calls to some of Sigma’s creditors early this week revealed nothing had changed, while calls to Sigma Autosport went unreturned. Papis, on the other hand, was very reachable—at least for those who bothered to try. 

"I haven’t been told anything at the moment from (Sigma team owner) Tom Wieringa, says Papis. "I heard he made a statement that we are not going to race in Chicago, but he never told me that. 

"I’m very disappointed, because Tom W. never even called me, but from what I know there is no way that Sigma can race in Chicago because there is no engine, no electronics—they don't have anything. 

"I can’t talk for Tom W., I can only talk for myself and I really don’t know what to say anymore."

<li>CART - CART IS PROMOTER FOR CHICAGO RACE</a><br>
When Championship Auto Racing Teams signs a deal to have a race at one of the 20 venues on its schedule, its main focus is to tend to the business of racing, while assisting the tracks where needed on the promotional side. But this weekend's CART Grand Prix of Chicago is a different beast, as the series took over the promotional side of the event as well in a move to keep the Chicago Motor Speedway oval—and one of the nation's biggest markets—on its schedule. 

CART has been responsible for everything from selling tickets to finding sponsor opportunities at the track in preparation for this weekend's event, and the organization’s management is pleased with the way things are shaping up. 

"The Chicago market is very important for any sports organization, and CART is no different," said CART President and CEO Chris Pook. "I am very pleased with the spectacular effort put forth by our people, as well as our sponsorship and marketing partners, in helping build a successful event." 

CART set up its own satellite office in Chicago to ensure that its staff would be in touch with everything that needed to be done for the race, having to take over the promotional task after the owners of the track decided that they were not going to hold any auto races this season. CART announced that it was taking over promotional duties on March 4. 

The results will be there for all to see as CBS Sports presents live coverage of the CART Grand Prix of Chicago at 3:30 p.m. Eastern on Sunday, while SPEED Channel will carry Saturday's qualifying live at 2:30 p.m. Eastern as part of its nine hours of coverage from the event.

<li>WRC - $100M RIGHTS DEAL</a><br>
If anyone needed more evidence of the rapid growth of World Rallying as a sought-after commercial property, they got it today with the announcement that the FIA, had agreed to a mammoth new commercial rights deal for the sport. 

International Sportsworld Communicators signed up for a 100-year lease of the FIA World Rally Championship's commercial rights, in a deal similar to that held by Bernie Ecclestone's SLEC trust for Formula 1 commercial rights. The deal, which must be submitted to the FIA’s general assembly for final approval, is reportedly worth $100m, although that sum is not due until 10 years have elapsed. Should the sum be paid earlier, ISC will receive a discount. <p>

<li>F1 - FERRARI IS SLAPPED ON WRIST FOR AUSTRIAN FINISH</a><br>
After all the build-up, the FIA’s World Motorsport Council meeting to decide the "punishment" for Ferrari’s supposed transgressions at the Austrian Grand Prix last month proved more than a little anti-climactic. 

Following a special meeting of the council, it was determined that Ferrari was indeed guilty of violating podium procedures—and the team was fined $1 million, only one half of which must be paid immediately, with the other half suspended for a year. The actual team-ordered finish that instigated the incident was criticized by the council, but not penalized—and no championship points were deducted or positions changed, as had been rumored in the European press. 

The council "deplored the manner in which team orders were given and executed at the Austrian GP. Nevertheless the council finds it impossible to sanction the two drivers, because they were contractually bound to execute orders given by the team." 

The council also acknowledged "the long-standing and traditional right of a team to decree the finishing order of its drivers in what it believes to be the best interest of its attempt to win both World Championships." 

Officially, Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello broke Article 170 of the F sporting regulations when "winner" Schumacher" encouraged his teammate—who had led until the last few feet of the final lap—to take the top step of the podium, rather than himself.

<li>NASCAR - RICKY RUDD WINS AT SEARS POINT</a><br>
Dogged Ricky Rudd saw the hex on his team shatter with Jerry Nadeau's pinion gear. The sky cleared, the waters parted, and Rudd drove to flags and fireworks in victory lane. 

Rudd received the lead with three laps to go when surprise front-runner Nadeau's final drive gave out. Nadeau, with a 4.4sec lead over his straining rival, was going to win Sunday's Dodge/Save Mart 350 if nothing went wrong. 

Rudd knows the feeling. "You've just got to keep plugging away, and when it's your day, it's your day," he said. "You certainly look back and say, 'Man, I could be sitting here with four wins right now,' but it just wasn't meant to be, and you pick up and go on."

<li>CART - INCREASED INTERNATIONAL TV COVERAGE</a><br>
Continuing its efforts to expand the international profile of the FedEx Championship Series, CART and its partner Octagon CSI have forged a new association with FOX Sports International to broadcast live races to five more regions of the globe, beginning with this weekend's CART Grand Prix of Chicago. 

Octagon CSI has secured non-exclusive rights for CART events through FOX Sports International, and will broadcast events in Latin America, the Middle East, Israel, Hungary and the Czech Republic. The remainder of the 2002 CART season will be shown live to those regions. 

Brazil, which has already secured CART TV coverage in a separate arrangement, is not covered under this program. Among other nations receiving CART broadcasts in either live, delayed or highlights format are the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Sweden, Mexico and New Zealand.
