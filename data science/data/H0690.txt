      <p><a href=ozpage1.html><b>State of the Art in Artificial Hearts</b></a> 
      <p> An interview with cardiac transplant authority Dr. Mehmet Oz, Coulmbia 
        University, NY, NY. Patients with advanced heart failure have few options. 
        They must either receive a new human heart from a brain-dead donor or 
        die. The outlook for these patients is now improving, as temporary implantable 
        pumps called ventricular assist devices keep patients alive for longer 
        periods as they await a heart transplant. Perhaps most promising of all, 
        a new artificial heart is now ready for human trials. 
      <p><a href=miller.html><b>From Primordial Soup to the Prebiotic Beach</b> 
        </a> 
      <p> An interview with Exobiology pioneer, Stanley L. Miller, University 
        of California San Diego. Dr. Miller's classic electric discharge experiment 
        carried out in Harold Urey's University of Chicago laboratory in the early 
        1950's demonstrated that important biomolecules such as amino acids could 
        be synthesized under possible primitive earth conditions. 
      <p><strong><a href=plotkin1.html>An Interview with Mark Plotkin, Ph.D., 
        Executive Director, Ethnobiology and Conservation Team, and author of 
        Tales of the Shaman's Apprentice.</a></strong> 
      <p>In this interview, conducted at the 1996 Access Excellence
Summit,  Dr. Plotkin gives some background on the field of
ethnobotany and describes both the process and romance of
seeking out healing substances in the tropical rain forests.

<strong><a href=madcow96.html>Dr. F.A. Murphy &amp; Mad Cow

Disease, the BSE Epidemic in Great Britain</a></strong>
<p>
The announcement by British health authorities that bovine

spongiform  encephalopathy (BSE), also known as  mad cow

disease, may have been  transmitted to humans has led to a

chaotic situation in the UK with ripple effects occurring

throughout Europe and the rest of the world. What is BSE  and

what is its relation to scrapie in sheep and Creutzfeldt-Jakob

disease  (CJD) in humans? 
<p>
<br>
<p><strong> <A HREF=bier.html>Dr. Dennis Bier &amp; USDA Diet

Guidelines</A></strong>

<p>
Every five years the USDA releases new dietary
guidelines. Every time they do this the guidelines are different
from the ones before. This is because a panel of experts from
across the country considers thousands of new studies and forms
a consensus based on that data. I spoke with one of the panel
members, Dennis Bier, M.D. about the new guidelines. Check the
resource guide at the end of the interview for more
information.<p>

<p>

<strong> <A HREF=saltnm.html>Food For Thought: An Interview with

Nutrition Scientist Dr. Paul Saltman</A></strong>
<p>
We are barraged by the media with endless claims and promises

about the value or risks of what we eat and drink and what we

take in the way of dietary supplements. Where is the science? I

spoke with nutrition science authority Dr. Paul Saltman,

professor of biology at UCSD, and author of various texts and

popular books about the science of nutrition, in an effort to

separate some nutrition facts from food fiction. 
<p><br>

<strong> <A HREF=perss2.htm>I. Persson Discusses Hormone

Replacement and Cancer Risk</A></strong>

<p>
Even the most complicated scientific studies depend on the
fundamentals of good design and methodology. When the studies
are epidemiological in nature, the picture becomes even more
complex. Recent epidemiologic studies have produced contrasting
results regarding the potential risk of hormone replacement
therapy and risk of breast cancer in menopausal women. How does
one go about sifting the scientific wheat from the statistical
chaff? I asked noted breast cancer researcher and epidemiologist
Ingemaar Persson, M.D., of the department of cancer
epidemiology, University of Uppsala, Sweden, to clarify some of
these issues.
<p><br>
<p><strong> <a href=interview_murphy.html>An Interview with

Dr. F. A. Murphy, Ebola Virus expert</a> </strong>
<p>
The book "The Hot Zone" and the film "Outbreak" have seized
the public's imagination and brought into focus many issues
regarding the very real threats posed by new and emerging
diseases. In this interview we talk with Frederick A. Murphy,
D.V.M., Ph.D., Dean of School of Veterinary Medicine, UC Davis.
<p>
At the time of the 'Reston incident', Dr. Murphy was the director
of the National Center for Infectious Diseases at the CDC in
Atlanta. Dr. Murphy is considered one of the world authorities on
viruses. He was the first one to look at Ebola virus
'face-to-face' in the electron microscope. Dr. Murphy appears in 
"The Hot Zone" and his now famous photo of the Ebola virus
appears in the film "Outbreak". <p> 
<p><br>
<p><strong> <a href=interview_dr_hennekens.html>An

Interview with Epidemiologist Dr. Charles Hennekens</a>

</strong>
<p>
An interview with noted epidemiologist Charles Hennekens, M.D.,

Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, and Chief,

Division of Preventive Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital,

Boston, MA. 
<p>
We are bombarded with endless, sometimes conflicting, media

reports announcing that this food is good for you or that

activity is bad for you. Where do these claims originate and how

much scientific merit do they have? For example, most of us have

heard that low doses of aspirin taken over the long term

significantly reduce the risk for
heart attack. Dr. Hennekens is the director of the Physicians'

Health Study, the large long-term study which demonstrated

conclusively that aspirin did reduce the chance of a first heart

attack in middle-age men. Another part of that trial is

evaluating the potential role for the antioxidant vitamin

beta-carotene in protecting against heart disease
and cancer, and will be completed next year. I caught up with

Dr. Hennekens at the annual meeting of the American Heart

Association in Dallas and asked him to elaborate on the science

of public health. 
<p><br>
<p>
<strong> <a href=interview_dr_bruce_alberts.html>An

Interview With Dr. Bruce Alberts, President of the National

Academy of Sciences</a></strong>
<p>The National Academy of Sciences recently released the draft of

new guidelines that propose significant changes in science

education from kindergarten through high school. The proposed

standards represent an unprecedented collaboration of teachers,

scientists and education specialists. Why were the standards

created? What will science education look like in the future?

How can administrative resistance be overcome? What about the

growing use of
computers and the Internet? I spoke with Dr. Bruce Alberts,

President of the National Academy of Sciences recently about

these and related issues. 
<p><br>
<p>
<strong> <a href=interview_dr_bruce_weir.html>An

Interview With DNA Forensics Authority Dr. Bruce Weir</a> </strong>
<p>
The term DNA fingerprinting was coined by British geneticist

Alec Jeffreys only ten years ago. Since that time, DNA forensics

has become an important tool in law enforcement. In some cases

the DNA tests have helped convict suspects, while in others the

tests have exonerated suspects or overturned previous

convictions. Recent high profile court cases have put the

spotlight on DNA forensics and created the impression that there

is a lack of
agreement among the experts on the reliability of this evidence.

I spoke with Dr. Bruce S. Weir, an expert witness for the

prosecution in the OJ Simpson case, about the methods and

controversies surrounding DNA evidence.
