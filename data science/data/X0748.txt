<ul>
    <li><font size="5">The President opened the planned agenda at
        9:15 PM. </font></li>
    <li><font size="5"><b>Treasurer's Report-</b> Joey Gray-
        First year for a</font><a href="2001Budget.htm"><font
        size="5"> formal budget</font></a><font size="5"> in
        2001. Passed by the Board in May 2001. Also displayed in
        the Congress booklet were the 1996-2000 financial
        summaries. Joey pointed out that the last three years
        show net losses. She stressed that this trend must be
        reversed if we are to continue to operate. We have had a
        margin of financial relief through a one-time windfall
        from WorldSport last year. Problems with dues payment
        have included keeping contact information up to date.
        There are many things that could possibly be done to
        increase our income possibilities, but staff time has
        been very restricted. One specific plan, which was
        suggested by Stefan Palm is to assure that the funds held
        by WFDF will be put into an account that will generate a
        higher level of interest. Details of the budget were
        discussed. Some proposed projects were discussed
        including the application from Seppo Nieminen from
        Finland for a video of the 1999 WOC. </font></li>
    <li><font size="5"><b>General Organization and By-Laws</b>-
        Bill Wright- Discussion of the general question of
        national versus event organization members. This issue
        has largely been driven by certain countries in which
        there have developed distinctly separate organizations
        which are focused on particular disc sports. There was
        concern about the short time that the members have had to
        consider the issue. Some comments from the floor were
        entertained. Stefan Palm pointed out that having a single
        organization in Sweden was critical in their
        communication with the governmental authorities. The
        secretary made a suggestion that the Congress authorize
        the formation of a task force to examine this issue,
        including the implications of any proposed changes for
        the by-laws. A motion was made by Dan Roddick that a task
        force be named to consider these issues. The motion was
        seconded by Conrad Damon and passed without dissent. </font><font
        color="#F63F1B" size="5">Action Item.</font><font
        size="5"> The Board will proceed to set up that
        committee. A time line was added which requires a
        specific proposal be returned to the Board by no later
        than three months prior to the 2002 Congress. It was
        further asserted that there be broad international
        representation on the task force. There was some
        discussion about the national versus domestic
        responsibilities of PDGA and UPA. There was also
        discussion of the participation of such new activities as
        Beach Ultimate and Goltimate and the suggestion was made
        by Stefan Palm that such activities fall directly in the
        responsibility of the Team Events Committee to detemine
        their appropriate form of participation. This met with
        general agreement.</font></li>
    <li><font size="5"><b>Elections </b>&#150; The president
        called for nominations for WFDF Board positions that are
        to be received by the end of September 2001. The nominees
        will then be forwarded to the voting members for voting
        which is scheduled to be from November 7-14,<b> </b>2001.The
        position of WFDF Secretary and five Board positions and a
        deputy will be open for nomination. See the </font><a
        href="wfdfbord.htm"><font size="5">WFDF Board listing </font></a><font
        size="5">for details.</font></li>
    <li><font size="5">Strategic Vision- No specific discussion
        on this topic because of time restraints. There was talk
        of a need for a specific gathering, not at a competitive
        event, for this purpose. Cost implications were
        mentioned.</font></li>
    <li><font size="5"><strong>Committees</strong>- The president
        discussed the Board </font><a
        href="committeeresolution.htm"><font size="5">resolution</font></a><font
        size="5"> regarding the committee structure of WFDF. The
        planned process of reconstituting the committees per the
        WFDF by-laws was detailed. It was generally agreed that
        the movement toward our original by-laws structure is
        important in order to proceed with changes. Nominations
        for all committees and subcommittees will be accepted by
        the Board until the end of September, 2001. At that time
        the members of the committees will be named and they will
        be given initial operating procedures and charged with
        selection of their chairpersons and ongoing procedures.
        This process is then to continue on an annual basis.</font></li>
    <li><font size="5"><strong>World Records-</strong> The
        secretary continues to maintain these records and post
        them on the WFDF </font><a href="rulrec.htm"><font
        size="5">website</font></a><font size="5">.</font></li>
    <li><font size="5"><strong>Scheduling-/Bid Reviews</strong>-
        WUCC 2002 Hawaii is the only confirmed future event. Bids
        were encouraged for all events with particular emphasis
        on the importance of getting WOC 2003 and WUG 2004 in
        place shortly. There was general discussion about the
        importance of a broader reach of sanctioned WFDF events
        to further generate critical operating income. It was
        also noted that World Games 2005 will take place in
        Germany.</font></li>
