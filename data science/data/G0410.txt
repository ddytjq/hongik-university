            <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="2">Astronomical refractors 
            are renowned for providing superb views of the planets, Moon, and 
            double stars. They are ideal scopes for terrestrial observation too. 
            Refractors have a long, relatively thin tube with a main (objective) 
            lens at the front that focuses the incoming light, which is then redirected 
            to a comfortable viewing angle by a diagonal mirror or prism (optional). 
            The image is then magnified by a small eyepiece lens. Refractors are 
            rugged, require practically no maintenance, and are highly portable 
            in smaller apertures.&nbsp;</font></font> 
            <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">While more expensive refractors 
              are prized for their high-contrast, razor-sharp images, the inexpensive 
              variety commonly sold in department stores should be avoided. They 
              generally suffer from low optical quality, poorly fitting plastic 
              parts, and spindly mounts that wobble at the slightest touch, ruining 
              the view. Claims for high magnification-300x or higher-are deceptive 
              and a sure sign of an inferior product. The practical limit (for 
              any telescope) is about 50x or 60x per inch of aperture, or 144x 
              for a typical 60mm (2.4-inch) scope. Going any higher will provide 
              only dim, fuzzy images. Magnification is not related to quality 
              or performance.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">A good-quality refractor 
              will have at least a two-element (achromatic) objective lens and 
              sturdy mechanical construction. Fittings for the eyepiece, diagonal 
              prism, and other accessories should be made of machined metal, not 
              plastic. The tripod can be wood or aluminum, as long as it's stable.</font><font face="Arial" size="2"></font></p>

            <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="2">The Newtonian reflector 
            (named after Sir Isaac Newton, its inventor) is a popular and economical 
            astronomical telescope. Its simple high-performance design provides 
            tremendous light grasp at the lowest cost per unit of aperture of 
            any type of telescope. It works by reflecting incoming light off a 
            large, curved &quot;primary&quot; mirror at the base of the optical 
            tube up to a smaller, flat &quot;secondary&quot; or &quot;diagonal&quot; 
            mirror near the front end of the tube. The secondary directs the narrowed 
            light cone out of the tube and into the eyepiece. Small Newtonians 
            are very portable because the tube detaches from the mount in seconds.&nbsp;</font></font> 
            <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;<img
                src="reflector.gif" alt="Reflector" align="left"
                hspace="0" width="132" height="100">Larger Newtonians can be quite 
              large and unwieldy, which is part of the reason more compact scope 
              designs such as the Schmidt-Cassegrain have gained popularity. But 
              reflectors have much to recommend them. Besides their low cost, 
              they're pretty easy to make for the do-it-yourselfer. Optical quality 
              can be very good. The mirrors are adjustable, so you can keep the 
              optics in perfect alignment (collimation).&nbsp;</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Their large apertures make 
              reflectors ideal for observing galaxies, star clusters, and nebulas. 
              They also provide sharp, high-contrast planetary and lunar views. 
              Dew does not readily form on the mirrors because the open tube acts 
              as a passive dew shield. But because the optical tube is open to 
              the air, it should be capped when not in use to prevent accumulation 
              on the mirrors of dust and dirt. Newtonian tubes can be supported 
              on a variety of different mounts: the standard altazimuth mount 
              on a tripod, an equatorial mount, or on a cabinet-style &quot;Dobsonian&quot; 
              mount. Reflectors are not well suited for terrestrial observing, 
              because the image is often rotated upside-down or sideways.</font><font face="Arial" size="2"></font></p>

              of the Schmidt - Cassegrain telescope has made it the most popular 
              telescope type among amateur astronomers. The optical tube is much 
              shorter and, thus, more lightweight than that of a Newtonian reflector 
              of similar aperture and focal length because the light path is &quot;folded&quot; 
              inside the Schmidt - Cassegrain. Light enters through a &quot;corrector&quot; 
              lens at the front of the telescope and is reflected off the primary 
              mirror to an adjustable, magnifying secondary mirror on the inside 
              of the corrector lens. The light beam is then directed out the back 
              of the tube to an eyepiece.</font></font> </p>
            <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The Schmidt - Cassegrain 
              design was made commercially economical in <img

                align="left" hspace="0" width="100" height="105">the late 60's 
              by the production innovations of California telescope maker Tom 
              Johnson. His techniques for mass-producing the Schmidt corrector 
              lens were the foundation for Celestron's affordable and wildly successful 
              8&quot; f/10 &quot;C8,&quot; introduced in 1970. This complex-curved 
              front lens corrects for optical aberrations, and also seals the 
              telescope tube, which helps to keep the internal optics clean.</font> 
            </p>
            <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">For visual observation, the 
              Schmidt - Cassegrain is an all-around strong performer. Optically 
              and mechanically, it is ideally suited for astrophotography-from 
              simple piggyback shots to extended, through-the-scope exposures 
              of deep-sky objects. Its compactness allows it to be mounted on 
              a lightweight fork-style equatorial mount, an option not available 
              to long-tube conventional reflectors. As for price, Schmidt - Cassegrains 
              fall in the middle between reflectors, which cost less, and refractors, 
              which cost more, per inch of aperture. </font></p>

            in a compact body. It uses a combination of mirrors and lenses, most 
            notably a deeply concave front (&quot;meniscus&quot;) corrector lens. 
            This lens corrects the optical aberrations of the spherical primary 
            mirror to yield sharp images over a wide field of view. Light passes 
            through the corrector to the primary mirror and is reflected to an 
            aluminized spot on the back side of the corrector, then exits out 
            through an opening in the primary mirror to the eyepiece The Maksutov 
            design was introduced by the Russian optical scientist D.D. Maksutov 
            in 1941. &quot;Maks&quot; have a desirable closed-tube design, are

            models are difficult to manufacture (and thus are very expensive),
