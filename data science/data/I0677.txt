facilities for disabled visitors. The guide is probably the most complete

from the Royal Hotel. It is usually advisable to book for evening meals, but
you may get lucky. 
</P><P>There are also a couple of places along Nantwich Road which do take-away.
Brett Jackson "would recommend two places to get a good curry in Crewe, these
are the Passage to India (near the Barrel pub), and Taquidur (across from
the Earl of Crewe)." [Both these establishments are on Nantwich Road.]
</P><P>If your tastes extend to kebabs, try the Persian Kebab House (on Nantwich Road), usually only open in the evenings. Next door to this is a Greek restaurant. 
There are numerous shops along Nantwich Road, including a newsagent, a
greengrocer, and a sandwich shop, plus Chatwin's bakery, pie and cake shop
(though this is usually closed by lunchtime on Saturdays). 
Rail travelers can, of course, try the buffet on Crewe railway station

the third roundabout in the space of about a mile, you pass the Crewe Arms
on your right and Crewe Station on your left. Gresty Road is the first left
after the Station. Beware: on match days, you may not be able to take this 
left turn, and may be redirected to the next left (100 yards, South St, at 
traffic lights).
</P><P>From south and east: Exit M6 at junction 16 (A500). At roundabout follow signs
for Crewe. After about two miles, turn right at roundabout (A5020) towards
Crewe then left at the next roundabout (0.8m). Go straight on at the next
roundabout (Rookery pub on right), passing the Brocklebank pub on the
left; then left at the next - and final - roundabout, taking you into Nantwich
Road, passing the Crewe Arms Hotel on your right and Crewe Station on your
left.
</P><P>From West: From Nantwich, follow Crewe Road, A534 (signs to Crewe Station,
4 miles), which will eventually bring you along Nantwich Road. The turning

</P><P>Most of the hotels mentioned are actually in Nantwich which is an attractive,
historic town, lots of old buildings, fairly small, rather a lot of
antique shops, but with a good choice of pubs and a couple of popular
night-clubs. It is about 4 miles from Crewe.
</P><P>The Malbank Hotel
(14 Beam Street, Nantwich, Cheshire. Tel: 01270 626011; fax: 01270 624435)
</P><P>It deserves a mention as it supports Crewe Alex (it advertises in the matchday
programme and around the pitch perimeter at Gresty Road. It is a combined
hotel and pub and is friendly, the food is excellent. This can be proved 
by how popular it is with the locals. The owner, Chris Evans, is a very
friendly and likeable person who will get into discussions on the Alex
(although he's from Chester, and at heart a Chester City fan) and will
chat about most sports in general and is a Man Utd season ticket holder.
</P><P>The rooms are a mixture of en-suite and the bathrooms down the corridor. They
can be very busy mid-week, but week-end shouldn't prove a problem. In the
morning make sure you are hungry because the breakfast are enormous and 
you'll go some to scoff the lot.
</P><P>Be warned Friday and  Saturday nights the pub is heaving , as are most pubs
in Nantwich, 
</P><P>The Peacock Hotel
(221 Crewe Road, Nantwich, Cheshire CW5 6NE. Tel 01270 624069, fax: 01270 610113)
</P><P>The Peacock is on the A534 just west of its junction with the A500 (A51), just
over a mile from Nantwich and about three miles from Crewe, another 
combined pub/hotel it boasts a purpose-built residential block at  the
rear of the main pub/restaurant building. It has 37 rooms ,that are spacious,
warm, comfortable, with en suite bathroom facilities, Sky 
TV, telephones, tea/coffee-making facilities, a complementary newspaper, etc. 
</P><P>The food is OK - a wide choice (including vegetarian), hot and plenty of it,
but not exactly home-made - mainly standard items off a brewery-produced
menu. However, you can choose to sit in smoking or non-smoking areas, there is
a kid's menu (and some toys and games for them, plus an outdoor adventure
playground if the weather is fine), the staff were young and friendly.

experienced problems with stewards, but this has usually been down to
over-enthusiasm. Most are football fans themselves and so adopt a fairly
common-sense approach.

Blue Moon (although Man City fans will no doubt dispute this), they do
however make up for this by making use of West Broms 'Bagies, Bagies,
Boing, Boing' as 'Alex, Alex, Boing, Boing'.
</P><P>It is also worth mentioning that The Alex do seem a bit fond of their musical
accompaniment, not limited to the normal drums and trumpets. Crewe have
even been known to take a Oboe to games with them.
Also the 1998 World Cup inspired chart hit 'Carnival De Paris' featured a
trumpet solo from one of the Gresty Road faithful and the band (Dario G)
even took their name from the Crewe manager.
