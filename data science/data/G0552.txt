Abstract
<p>
We present CO (1-0) observations of 51 galaxies from an optically-selected
sample of binarie in the southern hemisphere.
Data were taken with the SEST 15m telescope (44" beam). CO emission
was detected from 33 galaxies, corresponding to a 65%
detection rate. There is a strong correlation between
the normalized CO and FIR luminosities.
As already noted in other samples, the far infrared luminosity L(FIR)
normalized to the blue luminosity and the star formation efficiency,
as traced by the L(FIR)/M(H2) ratio, are enhanced, suggesting a tidal
trigger for the star-formation. The FIR luminosity normalized to the optical 
surface is also enhanced.
<p>
The CO luminosity is enhanced in tidally perturbed objects,
suggesting that the amount of molecular gas is higher in the
interacting objects. The L(FIR)/L(B), and L(CO)/L(B) ratios correlate,
although weakly, with the component separation in the binaries,
while the L(FIR)/M(H2) does not. This suggests that one of the
main phenomena triggering star formation is the enhancement
in the total amount of molecular gas. The gas inflow is
probably due to the gravitatioanl torques produced by tidal interaction. 
Our observations show that interacting galaxies have both a higher 
star formation efficiency and a larger mass of molecular gas available to 
fuel star formation.
