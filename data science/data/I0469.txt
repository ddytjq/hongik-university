    <td><font SIZE="2"></font><font size="3">Set up on 18th July 1994, the Barcelona Football
    Club Foundation is a key organisation for the present and future of the Club. Promoted by
    the Chairman Josep Lluís Nuñez, the Foundation was set up thanks to the contributions of
    thousands of Barcelona fans.<p>Aim of the Foundation:</p>
    <p>Promote the social projection of F.C. Barcelona. Co-operate in the desired form and
    manner with F.C. Barcelona, as well as other social, cultural, beneficial artistic and
    sporting institutions. </p>
    <p>Administrate studies, inscriptions or subsidies, books, etc., through the creation of
    aid or grants of different types, with the range and conditions deemed adequate in each
    circumstance.</p>
    <p>Build , promote and administrate museums and cultural institutions, as well as
    exhibition rooms, archives and libraries, and supplying facilities which are mainly
    devoted to the practice of sport at a junior or amateur level.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="../images/fundacio.jpg" width="459" height="175"

    <p>Any other activity which, generally, will involve, at the discretion of the Board
    members, promotion of the spirit which forms part of the Foundation's constitution and
    ethos. </p>
    <p>The Foundation is an organisation that monitors the basic sport, the sports sections,
    the museum and all the activities that require economic aid. It concentrates on promoting
    the participation of different sectors of Catalan society in the defence and development
    of all the cultural and sports activities that make our Club unique. </p>
    <p>At present, the Foundation has 22,000 members; a figure that never ceases to grow
    thanks to the unconditional support of its members and fans of Barça. In appreciation,
    the Club puts their names on ceramic plaques in the Stadium. Some names are renowned and
    others unheard of, but all are equally important for the Foundation.</p>
    <p>In addition, the Foundation also receives enormous particpation from the world of
    business. To date, this opportunity to join this huge Barcelona organisation has been
    taken by 94 companies: 23 are Members of Honour, 48 Collaborating Members and 23
    Protecting Members.</p>
