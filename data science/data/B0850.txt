      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Total assets have 
          risen to &pound;2.53 billion, an increase of &pound;113 million (4.7%) 
          in the six month period and some &pound;220 million (9.5%) up on 30 
          June 2000.</font> </li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&pound;253 million 
          of new mortgage lending represents a record for any six month period 
          in the Newcastle's history and is 31% up on 30 June 2000. </font> </li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Share balances 
          have increased by &pound;144 million (8.9%) in the first six months 
          of 2001, compared to &pound;40 million (2.9%) for the first half of 
          2000. </font> </li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Income &amp; Expenditure 
        Account </b></font> </p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Profit after tax 
          rose by 7.9% to &pound;5.73 million compared to 30 June 2000.</font> 
        </li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Management expenses 
          as a percentage of mean assets have fallen from 1.03% at 30 June 2000 
          to 0.98% at 30 June 2001.</font> </li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The charge for 
          bad and doubtful debts has fallen from &pound;276,000 to &pound;265,000.</font> 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Commenting on the 
        results, chief executive, Robert Hollinshead said: "We've made an excellent 
        start to the year, as these results clearly demonstrate. Our new business 
        performance is better than it has ever been and can be attributed to the 
        popularity of our range of innovative products.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The growth in profit 
        closely matches the growth in the size of the balance sheet, enabling 
        us to maintain our strong capital ratios.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"A combination of 
        our improved efficiency levels, as indicated by the reduction in management 
        expenses and the continued excellence of our mortgage portfolio, demonstrated 
        by the low level of bad debts, allowed us to price our products very competitively.</font> 
      </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Bringing the benefits 
        of technology to our customers has and will remain at the heart of our 
        strategy. We will continue to exploit new technologies to improve customer 
        service and to provide the benefits of innovative, 'best buy' products 
        both to our online and branch based customers."</font> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Innovative Products</b></font> 
      </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the first six 
        months of the year, the Newcastle added a number of innovative products 
        to its mortgage and investment portfolios. These included a 10 year fixed 
        rate mortgage at 5.99% - one of the lowest long term fixed rates available 
        on today's market. This product also features an annual month-long window 
        during which borrowers can signify their intentions to redeem their mortgage 
        without penalty, should they choose to do so.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Society's Global 
        Guaranteed Equity Bond proved popular amongst savers who were looking 
        for the security of a product which presented no risk to capital but offered 
        unlimited growth potential by being linked to three international stock 
        market indices.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NewcastleNet, the 
        Society's Internet-based savings account continued to feature regularly 
        in 'best buy' tables and in March was granted industry-wide recognition, 
        when it won the award for Best Use of New Media in Customer Facing Environments 
        at the prestigious Financial Sector Technology Awards.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A dedicated online 
        account for solicitors was launched in June. This allows solicitors to 
        deposit client funds with the Newcastle via the Internet, a process which 
        has the potential to generate large volumes of new business for the Society.</font> 
      </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Innovative Services</b></font> 
      </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An online insurance 
        supermarket has recently been launched in four North East branches as 
        well as on the Society's Internet site. Branch staff are available to 
        guide customers through the application process, which will culminate 
        in the customer receiving quotes from 10 insurance companies. This product, 
        which will be rolled out across the branch network later in the year, 
        will allow customers who are not 'Internet enabled' to benefit from the 
        lower premiums that can be found online.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Earlier in the year, 
        Avenue One, the Newcastle's online shopping mall was launched. It enables 
        customers to visit a branch and with the assistance of a customer adviser, 
        browse through the range of 30,000 products, which are available at prices 
        lower than those that can be found on the High Street. They can do this 
        without any concerns over Internet security or the complexity of some 
        Internet sites.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Later in the year, 
        an online wealth portal, which will allow customers to buy and sell shares 
        and unit trusts, will be added to the Society's Internet-based range of 
        services. As with the shopping mall and the insurance supermarket, this 
        facility will be made available on both the Society's web site and also 
        in branches.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>New Business Opportunities</b></font> 
      </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Newton Facilities 
        Management Limited, the joint venture company founded by the Newcastle 
        (75% stakeholding) and the Melton Mowbray Building Society (25% stakeholding) 
        continued to win new business. The company was awarded a contract to provide 
        fully managed information technology services and support to the Stafford 
        Railway Building Society. The contract includes the provision of compliance 
        guaranteed software, hardware products and associated IT support services.</font> 
      </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Stafford Railway staff 
        have been trained on the new systems by experts from the Newcastle, with 
        the software expected to go live at the end of August. The software will 
        be used throughout the Stafford Railway's business, while the main IT 
        server will be based in Newcastle.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Outlook</b></font> 
      </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Newcastle is committed 
        to achieving the highest possible standards of customer service. To do 
        so, the Society will make full use of technological advances and will 
        continue to offer a range of innovative and competitively priced mortgage 
        and investment products. The Newcastle's excellent financial performance 
        in the first six months of 2001 and the prospects for further growth in 
        the second half of the year, leaves it well placed to tackle the challenges 
        posed by the increasingly competitive financial services sector.</font>

      </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have been instructed 
        by the Society to review the financial information which comprises the 
        consolidated income and expenditure account and the consolidated balance 
        sheet and we have read the other information contained in the interim 
        report for any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with 
        the financial information.</font> </p>

      </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The interim report, 
        including the financial information contained therein, is the responsibility 
        of, and has been approved by the directors. The Listing Rules of the Financial 
        Services Authority require that the accounting policies and presentation 
        applied to the interim figures should be consistent with those applied 
        in preparing the preceding annual accounts except where any changes, and 
        the reasons for them, are disclosed.</font> </p>

      </p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We conducted our review 
        in accordance with guidance contained in Bulletin 1999/4 issued by the 
        Auditing Practices Board. A review consists principally of making enquiries 
        of group management and applying analytical procedures to the financial 
        information and underlying financial data, and based thereon, assessing 
        whether the accounting policies and presentation have been consistently 
        applied unless otherwise disclosed. A review excludes audit procedures 
        such as tests of controls and verification of assets, liabilities and 
        transactions. It is substantially less in scope than an audit performed 
        in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards and therefore provides 
        a lower level of assurance than an audit. Accordingly we do not express 
        an audit opinion on the financial information.</font> </p>

      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the basis of our 
        review we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made 
        to the financial information as presented for the six months ended 30 
        June 2001.</font> </p>
