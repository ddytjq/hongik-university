ABOUT THIS FILE:

    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to
    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short).

    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about
    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.
    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are
    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.

    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.
    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.

    Changes from the <FONT COLOR="#AF3F00">2000</FONT> rules are denoted in <FONT COLOR="#AF3F00">color</FONT>.
    Not every change is marked in this file is marked, but
    most are. :-)

    WHAT'S NEW IN <FONT COLOR="#AF3F00">2001</FONT>:

    The contest runs from <FONT COLOR="#AF3F00">01-Oct-2001</FONT> 00:00 UTC to <FONT COLOR="#AF3F00">01-Dec-2001</FONT> 23:59 UTC.

HINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:

    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See
    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.

    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries
    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year
    might be 'old' the next year.

    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply
    a number of tests to an entry:

        * look at the original source
        * convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII
        * C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines
        * C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines
        * run it through a C beautifier
        * examine the algorithm
        * compile it <FONT COLOR="#AF3F00">(with flags to enable all warnings)</FONT>
        * execute it

    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.
    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been
    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.

    Your entry need not pass all of the above tests.  In certain
    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the
    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as
    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given
    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that
    does something interesting when you run it.

    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave
    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life
    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request
    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the
    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.

    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries
    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'
    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use
    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)

    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make
    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly
    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some
    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.

    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that
    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off
    documenting it.  Noting "this entry sometimes prints the 4th power
    of a prime by mistake" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,
    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly
    working entry is best.

    People who are considering to just use some complex mathematical
    function or state machine to spell out something such as "hello,
    world!" may want to try and be more creative.

    Ultra-obfuscated programs are in some cases some cases easier to
    deobfuscate than subtly-obfuscated programs.  Consider using
    misleading or subtle tricks layered on top of or under an
    appropriate level of obfuscation.

    Programs that use VTxxx/ANSI sequences that are NOT limited to a
    specific terminal brand and that can also work in a standard xterm
    are considered portable.


OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:

    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We
    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests
    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far
    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.

    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:

        #define d define
        #d foo             &lt;-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo

    When declaring local or global variables, you should declare the type:

        int this_is_ok;
        this_is_not;       &lt;-- don't use such implicit type declaration<FONT COLOR="#AF3F00">s</FONT>

    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you
    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in
    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.  For example, using gcc
    local function declarations, such as:

        int
        main() {
                void blah() { printf("blah\n"); }
                blah();
        }

    are not allowed even though their existence seems tailor made for
    this contest!   But for now, since they are not in wide spread use
    we cannot accept entries that use them.

    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of
    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety
    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are
    not portable and must not be used:

        * assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable
        * casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable
        * passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg
        * passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg
        * performing arithmetic on va_list variables
        * using va_list as a structure or union

    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.

    Avoid using &lt;varargs.h&gt;  Use &lt;stdarg.h&gt; instead.

    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),
    the leading '#' must be the first non-whitespace character on a line.
    While some broken C preprocessors do not allow whitespace before a
    '#', most do.

    The exit() function returns void.  On some broken systems have exit()
    return int.  Your entry should assume that exit() returns a void.

    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.
    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do
    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people
    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for
    programs that are compact, and are instructional.

    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80
    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.

    We tend to dislike programs that:

        * are very hardware specific
        * are very OS version specific
             (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific
              code is likely not to be)
        * dump core or have compiler warnings
             (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)
        * won't compile or run under a POSIX P1003.1/P1003.2 like systems
        * depend on a utility or application not normally found on most
          most POSIX P1003.1/P1003.2 like systems
        * abuse the build file to get around the size limit
        * obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs
        * are longer than they need to be
        * are similar to previous winners
        * are identical to previous losers  :-)
        * are identical to future losers (<FONT COLOR="#AF3F00">Windows XP</FONT>) :-)

    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the
    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program
    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.

    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size
    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,
    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to
    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel
    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off
    if you show some amount of restraint.

    <FONT COLOR="#AF3F00">You should try to restrict commands used on the build file to
    POSIX-like or common Un*x-like commands.  You can also compile
    and use your own programs.  If you do, try to build and execute
    from the current directory.  This restriction is not a hard and
    absolute one.  The intent is to ensure that the building if your
    program is reasonably portable.

    Don't forget that the building of your program should be done
    ***without human intervention***.  So don't do:

        cat > prog.c
        cc prog.c -o prog

    However, you can do something cute such as making your program
    do something dumb (or cute) when build 'automatically'.  However
    when it is run with a human involved, do something more cleaver.
    For example, one could use the build instructions:

        cc prog.c -DNONHUMAN -o prog
        echo "See remarks section about alternate ways to compile"

    and then include special notes in the ---remarks--- section for
    alternate / human intervention based building.</FONT>

    We want to get away from source that is simply a compact blob of
    characters.  To help, we give a break to source that contains
    whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } characters.  While the
    number of characters excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline),
    and excluding any ; { or } followed immediately by either whitespace
    or end of file, must be &lt;= <FONT COLOR="#AF3F00">2048</FONT>, the total size may be less than <FONT COLOR="#AF3F00">4096</FONT>
    bytes.  This means that one may use "free of charge" up to <FONT COLOR="#AF3F00">2048</FONT>
    bytes of whitespace, or ; { or } followed by either whitespace
    or end of file.

    Please do not use things like gzip to get around the size limit.

    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob
    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C
    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third
    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!

    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'
    source.  The smallest, a zero byte entry, won in 1994.

    We do not like writable strings.  That is, we don't want stuff like:

        char *T = "So many primes, so little time!";
        ...
        T[14] = ';';

    Please don't make use of this feature, even if your system allows it.
    <FONT COLOR="#AF3F00">However, initialized char arrays are OK to write over.  This is OK:

        char b[] = "Is this Ok";
        b[9] = 'K';</FONT>

    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that
    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't
    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend
    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.

    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and
    software that is not in wide spread use.

    <FONT COLOR="#AF3F00">We don't like entries that use proprietary</FONT> M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok
    toolkits, since not everyone has them.  <FONT COLOR="#AF3F00">Use of OpenMotif is permitted
    because it is more widely and freely available.</FONT>

    You should avoid depending on a particular window manager.

    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on
    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines
    in the ---remark--- section.

    While we recognize that UN*X is not a universal operating system, the
    contest does have a bias towards such systems.  In an effort to expand
    the scope of the contest, we phrase our bias in terms of POSIX P1003.1
    and P1003.2 standards.  This will allow certain non-UN*X OS users to
    submit entries.  On the other hand, this is a guideline and not a rule.
    We will not reject an entry based on some POSIX technicality.

    When dealing with OS and application environments, we suggest that you
    be reasonable with a nod towards vanilla UN*X-like systems.  POSIX will
    evolve but not as much as the contest, so avoid stuff like POSIX real
    time, security, etc.

    We like programs that:

        * are as concise and small as they need to be
        * do something at least quasi-interesting
        * are portable
        * are unique or novel in their obfuscation style
        * MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION  &lt;== HINT!!
        * make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)  (humor helps!)

    Some types of programs can't excel (tm) in some areas.  Of course, your
    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several
    areas really does help.

    You are better off explaining what your entry does in the
    ---remark--- section rather than leaving it obscure for the judges
    as we might miss something and/or be too tired to notice.

    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in
    the ---remark--- section help your chances of winning.  If you had to
    read so many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.
    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.  We do read
    the ---remark--- section during the judging process, so it is worth
    your while to write a remarkable ---remark--- section.

    <FONT COLOR="#AF3F00">We dislike C code with trailing control-M's (\r or \015) that results
    in compilation failures.  Some non-Un*x/non-Linux tools such as
    MS Visual C and MS Visual C++ leave trailing control-M's on lines.
    Users of such tools should strip off such control-M's before submitting
    their entries.  In some cases tools have a "Save As" option that will
    prevent such trailing control-M's being added.

    We dislike entries that depend on non-portable libcurses features such
    as halfdelay().  One should restrict libcurses to portable features
    found on BSD and SVR4/System V curses.

    The rules disallow source that contains unescaped octets with values
    between 128 and 255.  You must use \octal or \hex escapes instead:

                  /* 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456 */
        char *foo = "This string is 36 octets in length \263";
              /* This octet requires 4 octets of source ^^^^ */
        if (strlen(foo) == 36) printf("foo is 36 octets a final NUL\n");</FONT>

    Be creative!


ABUSING THE RULES:

    Legal abuse of the rules is somewhat encouraged.  Legal rule abuse may
    involve, but is not limited to, doing things that are technically
    allowed by the rules and yet do not fit the spirit of what we
    intended to be submitted.

    Legal rule abuse is encouraged to help promote creativity.  Rule
    abuse entries, regardless of if they receive an award, result in
    changes to the next year's rules and guidelines.

    Legal abuse of the rules is NOT an invitation to violate the
    rules.  An entry that violates the rules in the opinion of the
    judges, WILL be disqualified.  RULE ABUSE CARRIES A CERTAIN LEVEL
    OF RISK!  If you have an entry that might otherwise be interesting,
    you might want to submit two versions; one that does not abuse the
    rules and one that does.

    If you intend to abuse the rules, indicate so in the ---remark---
    section.  You must try to justify why you consider your rule abuse
    to be allowed under the rules.  That is, you must plead your case
    as to why your entry is valid.  Humor and/or creativity help plead
    a case.

    Abusing the entry format tends to annoy us more than amuse us.

    We are often asked why the contest rules and guidelines seem too
    strange or contain mistakes, flaws or grammatical errors.
    One reason is that we sometimes make genuine mistakes.  But in many
    cases such problems, flaws or areas of confusion are deliberate.
    Changes to rules and guidelines in response to rule abuses, are
    done in a minimal fashion.  Often we will deliberately leave
    behind holes (or introduce new ones) so that future rule abuse may
    continue.

    At the risk of stating the obvious, this contest is a parity of the
    software development process.  The rules and guidelines are
    only a small part of the overall contest.  Even so, one may think
    the contest rule and guideline process as a parody of the sometimes
    tragic mismatch between what a customer (or marketing) wants and
    what engineering delivers.


ENTRY FORMAT:

    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your
    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,
    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the
    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)

    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to
    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that
    is found in mkentry.c:

        This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every
        attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces
        an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,
        where this program differs from the contest rules, the
        contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the
        contest rules before submitting an entry.

    <FONT COLOR="#AF3F00">NOTE: A copy of the mkentry program may be found at:

        <A HREF="http://www.ioccc.org/official/mkentry.c">http://www.ioccc.org/official/mkentry.c</A></FONT>

    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,
    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check
    the entry against the size rules.

    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about
    the mkentry.c program, please send EMail to the judges.  (see below)

    The following is a sample entry (the change bars are not part
    of the example, don't add them to your entry!)

    This is a not-very-obfuscated C program.  It is likely not to win a
    prize, because it doesn't have what it takes to win and because the
    author plans to forget to send it in before the deadline!  :-)

    Your entry's sections must be the same order as in the above example.

    Typically the build file should assume that the source is prog.c
    and will compile into prog.  If an entry wins, we will rename
    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,
    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional
    digit in case of name conflicts.

    Please note that the title must match the following regexp:

        ^[a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]*$

    and must be 1 to 31 chars in length.  Titles such as:

        foo.c
        this_invalid_title_is_too_long
        /dev/null

    are right out!  :-)

    Titles can be 31 chars long now, but please try to keep them short.
    Why 31?  Because at least one of the judges likes Mersenne primes!

    It is suggested, but not required, that the title should incorporate
    the author(s) username(s).

    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,
    we would use <FONT COLOR="#af3f00">chlejhse.c</FONT> and <FONT COLOR="#af3f00">chlejhse</FONT>.

    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source
    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the
    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful
    if you did one of the following:

        * Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.

        * Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:

                cc prog.c -o special_name

            or  rm -f special_src.c
                cp prog.c special_src.c
                cc special_src.c -o special_name

            or  rm -f special_build
                tail +4 build > special_build
                sh &lt; special_build

        * Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of
          your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You
          should uuencode these files in ---info--- sections.

    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,
    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid
    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should
    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This
    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.

    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We
    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the
    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.

    Typically the ---build--- command will contain a "cc" command.
    It is also ok to use a "gcc" command (and gcc args).  However keep
    in mind that your entry should be compilable by any standard ANSI C
    compiler and thus should not depend on a special gcc feature.

    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them
    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,
    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,
    then skip the ---info--- section.

    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that
    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an
    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample
    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a
    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a
    'hints' file.

    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For
    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed
    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,
    the entry should not require them exist.

    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name
    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,
    say so in the ---remark--- section.

    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they
    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say
    so in the ---remark--- section.

    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has
    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should
    have entry number 0.

    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry
    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the
    entry and expect us to see it.  (Our decoding tools are not AI
    progs!) If you need tell the judges something, put it in the
    ---remark--- section, or send a EMail to:

        questions@ioccc.org     (not the address for submitting entries)

    <FONT COLOR="#af3f00">You must include the words ``<I>ioccc question</I>''	in the subject of your
    EMail message when sending EMail to the judges.</FONT>

    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer
    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as
    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:

        Wed Feb 2 00:47:00 2001

    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The
    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many
    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:

        date -u "+%a %h %d %T 20%y"
        date -u sed -e 's/... \(20[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/'
        sh -c 'TZ=UTC date sed -e "s/... \(20[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'
        sh -c 'TZ=GMT date sed -e "s/... \(20[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'
        sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date sed -e "s/... \(20[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/"'

    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set
    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.
    Be sure that the resubmission uses the same title and entry number
    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be
    replaced.

JUDGING PROCESS:

    Entries are judged by Leonid A. Broukhis, Simon Cooper, Landon Curt Noll
    and Peter Seebach.

    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The EMail message
    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:

        ---entry--- section
        all ---author--- sections
        all ---info--- sections
        ---build--- section
        ---program--- section
        any other text, including the EMail message headers

    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure
    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was
    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the
    ---author--- sections and the title from the ---entry--- section
    are not read until the judging process is complete, and then only
    from entries that have won an award.

    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular
    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are
    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding
    out in the end, who won and where they were from.

    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.
    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all
    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning
    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even
    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (For the curious,
    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC
    winners at talks)

    After the initial announcement, we attempt to send EMail to the
    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give
    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their
    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes and typos.  We
    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.
    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.

    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,
    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;
    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does
    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the
    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.

    A reading consists of a number of actions:

        * reading the ---entry--- section
        * reading the uudecoded ---build--- section
        * reading the uudecoded ---program--- section
        * reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any
        * passing the source thru the C pre-processor
            skipping over any #include files
        * performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source
        * passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor
            skipping over any #include files

    In later rounds, other actions are performed:

        * compiling/building the source
        * running the program
        * performing miscellaneous tests on the source and binary

    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries
    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it
    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.
    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form
    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.
    An entry often will compete in several categories.

    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries
    we receive.  A typical category list might be:

        * best small one line program
        * best small program
        * strangest/most creative source layout
        * most useful obfuscated program
        * best game that is obfuscated
        * most creatively obfuscated program
        * most deceptive C code
        * best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)
        * best abuse of ANSI C
        * worst abuse of the rules
        * (anything else so strange that it deserves an award)

    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so
    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.
    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.

    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of
    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10
    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into
    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is
    less clear cut.

    Sometimes a final round entry os good enough to win, but is beat out
    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is
    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry
    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,
    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!

    More often than not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a
    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest
    rules in some way.

    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such
    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entries.  More often, the
    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.


ANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:

    <FONT COLOR="#AF3F00">In Jan or Feb 2002 the judges will post an initial announcement of who
    won, the name of their award, and a very brief description of the
    winning entry on the IOCCC web site:

            <A HREF="http://www.ioccc.org/whowon.html">http://www.ioccc.org/whowon.html</A>

    We will also submit a brief announcement story to /.:

            <A HREF="http://www.slashdot.org">http://www.slashdot.org</A>

    that, depending on the willingness of the /. editors, may be posted
    to their site at the same time.

    Note that initial announcement will NOT contain source.  This is because
    the winning authors are given a chance to review the judges comments,
    and test our Makefile.  This review process typically takes a few weeks.

    Sometime after the initial announcement, and once the the review by
    the winners has been completed (perhaps Feb or Mar 2002), the winning
    source will be posted to the IOCCC web site:

            <A HREF="http://www.ioccc.org/years.html">http://www.ioccc.org/years.html</A>

            NOTE: previous winners are available at that URL

    We will submit a story annoucing the availability of the winners
    to /. at the same time.

    Finally (again perhaps Feb or Mar 2002) the winning entries will be
    posted to the following groups:</FONT>

            comp.lang.c          comp.lang.c.moderated  alt.sources

    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following

            comp.sources.misc    comp.windows.x         comp.programming
            misc.misc            comp.std.c             alt.folklore.computers

    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines from around
    the world.  Winners have appeared in books ("The New Hackers Dictionary")
    and on T-Shirts.

    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-)


FOR MORE INFORMATION:

    You may contact the judges by sending EMail to the following address:

        questions@ioccc.org     (not the address for submitting entries)

    <FONT COLOR="#af3f00">You must include the words ``<I>ioccc question</I>'' in the subject of your
    EMail message when sending EMail to the judges.</FONT>

    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.  Comments about
    confusing rules and guidelines are also welcome.

    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to
    year.  You should be sure you have the current rules and guidelines
    prior to submitting entries.
