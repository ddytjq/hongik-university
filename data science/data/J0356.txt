      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Enough already!&nbsp; CART and
      the IRL can't continue to pull each other down and drive a wedge between
      the fans, the sponsors and the manufacturers.&nbsp;&nbsp;We examine how CART should position the Champ Car
      series to coexist peacefully with the IRL, how the IRL and CART can work
      together for a common goal, and how Indy Lights can support both series
      perfectly.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">NASCAR is successful because
      it has defined its product, defined its market, and focused all of its
      efforts to excel at one thing - stock car racing on ovals.&nbsp; IRL, even
      as weak as it still is, defined its mission in life and has stuck by it.
      Ditto for F1, they defined their series as the premier road racing series
      in the world.&nbsp; In all three cases there is no mistaking what their series
      is, and if you are a sponsor or a manufacturer, you know what you are
      getting yourself into before you dive in.&nbsp; If it makes good business
      sense to be in one of those particular racing series, you enter it knowing
      who your market is.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Such is not the case with
    CART.&nbsp; It wants to be a road, street and oval series so it can call
    itself the most diverse form of racing in the world, something a lot of
    people find intriguing, including I.&nbsp; It wants to be an American series
    that occasionally ventures overseas because some of its sponsors find value
    in that.&nbsp; Unfortunately, trying to be too many things to too many
    constituents is preventing CART from excelling at any one thing.&nbsp; Let's
    look at the key areas.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Circuits/cars</b>&nbsp; Some
    people question whether CART can continue to compete on all types of
    circuits without severely compromising its product. The situation that
    developed a few weeks ago in Texas whereby the race had to be cancelled
    because the cars were too fast, proved that the current champ cars are too
    fast for high banked ovals.&nbsp; Yet on road and street circuits one can
    make an argument the cars are well within the limits of the circuits to
    contest a safe, competitive race.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">How do you have one formula that
    can race on road/street circuits and on small/large ovals without having too
    much speed on one type of circuit and not enough on another?&nbsp; The IRL
    cars are maximized to excel at ovals and their races are relatively competitive.&nbsp;
    Unlike the current Champ cars, IRL cars are slow enough that they can race
    on almost any oval, although the 'pack' NASCAR-type racing they have created
    on the high-banked ovals can lead to disasters such as we saw at Atlanta
    recently.&nbsp; Luckily no one was killed. Yet an IRL car on a road and
    street circuit would be eaten alive by a Champ car or F1 car.&nbsp; F1 cars
    are maximized to be the ultimate road/street course racing cars, and they
    are.&nbsp; Winston Cup cars have been refined from the very beginning to be
    one thing and one thing only, oval track stock cars and there's no denying
    their races appeal to a great many people.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The fact of the matter is that
    CART's most successful venues have been the street and road circuits, and
    it's overseas races.&nbsp;
    The majority of its domestic (USA) oval races are poorly attended (as are the IRL's).&nbsp;
    It has been suggested that CART give all its USA oval races to the IRL and focus on
    becoming a premier road racing series, much like F1.&nbsp; I fully endorse
      that proposal, but with some interesting twists that I get into later.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Given the above, would CART be
    better served by focusing on the road and street circuits?&nbsp; One can
    make a strong argument for that.&nbsp; But what about the Indy 500?&nbsp;
    Well........What about it?&nbsp; It's part of the IRL series, and as much as CART and
    its constituents wish it were theirs, the fact of the matter is, it's not.&nbsp; It's Tony George's sandbox, and if you want to play in it you have
    to buy his shovel and bucket (equipment) and race it.&nbsp; Below we will
      address how CART drivers can compete in the Indy 500 even if it becomes a road
      racing series.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Stop Banging heads with NASCAR
      and the IRL</b>&nbsp; Like every good business, both NASCAR and the IRL
      want to be leaders in their market.&nbsp; CART is hampered by trying to
      knock heads with two very powerful and wealthy entities - NASCAR (through
      the France family wealth) and the
      IRL (through Tony George's wealth).&nbsp; While NASCAR has what appears to
      be a near-monopoly on oval track stock car racing in the USA, the IRL
      isn't quite there yet for open wheel cars, but Tony George isn't going to
      give up until it does.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The announcement this past
      week of a new stock car series (TRAC) starting up is more bad news for
      CART and the IRL.&nbsp; That's another series looking to pick up sponsors
      and TV air time, and that spells bad news for the IRL and CART teams that
      are still looking for sponsors.&nbsp; There is an over saturation of
      racing (and sports in general) in the USA, and the formation of this
      series is going to make it worse.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Actually, we think this is
      more bad news for the IRL than for CART.&nbsp; Track owners like Bruton Smith are
      looking for more races for their oval tracks.&nbsp; The IRL was trying to
      fill that void, though it has not been extremely successful at doing
      that.&nbsp; Now there is another stock car series looking to fill that
      void for owners like Bruton Smith.&nbsp; With Indy car wheels flying
      in grandstands on a regular basis on the high-banked tracks, how much
      longer will it be before Bruton Smith says enough with CART and the IRL,
      give me TRAC?&nbsp; If Bruton Smith doesn't do it, the insurance companies
      likely will.&nbsp; The handwriting is on the wall unless the CART and the IRL can come
      up with a way to guarantee the wheels don't fly.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Dividing Up The Pie</b>&nbsp;
      Given the above circumstances, and recognizing where CART's strengths and
      weaknesses are, here is how I think CART should position itself for the
      future.&nbsp; There is a terrible void, both in
      the USA and internationally for more top-level open wheel road course
      racing.&nbsp; There are many countries that want a F1 race but can't get
      one, and still more that already have one and want a second.&nbsp; Here in
      North America, all of CART's road and street races are well attended.&nbsp;
      It's clear there is a demand for more road racing worldwide.....it's there
      for CART's taking.&nbsp; What may be even more important, is that if CART
      is viewed as strictly a road racing series here in the USA, it won't be
      trying to compete for the same market as NASCAR and the IRL does (oval
      track racing) and therefore, when no longer viewed as a direct competitor,
      perhaps will thaw some of the bad blood between them.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">CART should, therefore,
      position Champ Car Racing (should be called FedEx cars, as 'Champ Cars' is
      lost on most fans) as strictly a road racing product, and it should
      position itself as a lower cost alternate to F1, but with turbo engines, a
      somewhat distinct difference.&nbsp; Whereas F1 is primarily a European
      road racing series that sometimes races elsewhere in the world, CART can
      be positioned as a North American road racing series that sometimes races
      elsewhere in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note - size wise, North America is
      actually larger than Europe, so CART would actually be more spread out and
      not as saturated as F1 is in Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The world is a VERY big place,
      and there is plenty of room for CART and F1 to co-exist peacefully.&nbsp;
      In fact, much as F1 is aligned with many engine manufacturers, perhaps
      CART will be able to entice more engine manufacturers to develop Champ Car
      engines if it brought them more worldwide exposure.&nbsp; One key
      advantage CART would bring over F1 is better exposure in the USA market,
      the biggest market for most car manufacturers.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">By racing on just street and
      road circuits, CART can optimize the Champ car rules for those types of circuits.&nbsp;
      Gone will be the problem CART currently
      has with too much HP for ovals.&nbsp; 850 to 900 HP for road and street
      circuits isn't so bad given how heavy a Champ car is.&nbsp; That means the
      current 2.65 liter turbo engines can be used for a few more years, at
      which time CART can adopt the 1.8 liter turbo formula, something it should
      have done years ago.&nbsp; CART can open up talks now with all the engine
      manufacturers and have one or two new ones onboard to coincide with the changeover
      to the 1.8 liter turbo formula, in say 2004.&nbsp; I would love to see the
      engine manufacturers, already unhappy with F1 and wanting to run their own
      series in 2008, force a common engine formula for both CART and F1, a
      lower cost, more restrictive one that could serve both series.&nbsp; They
      certainly would get more bang for the buck. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Rescuing Indy Lights and
      resurrecting The Triple Crown</b>&nbsp; I feel the IRL formula is a better
      formula for oval track open wheel racing than the current Champ Car
      formula.&nbsp; At 650 HP, it's the right power level for oval track
      racing.&nbsp; Therefore, The IRL formula should become the oval track
      formula and the Champ Car formula the road racing formula.&nbsp; CART
      really does not want to give up the Michigan 500 and Fontana 500, two of
      its more competitive races, but there's a way it can give those races to
      the IRL, yet still have them. For two years now I have pushed for CART
      to adopt the IRL formula for its Indy Lights series.&nbsp; Now, more than
      ever, it should.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Then I would like to see Champ
      Car drivers drive those cars in three Triple Crown races each year (Indy,
      Michigan and Fontana.&nbsp; See <a href="http://www.autoracing1.com/MarkC/2001/0515TripleCrown_Miller.htm">this
      article</a> for an in-depth discussion on the Triple Crown).&nbsp; What about the ovals in Japan, England and
      Europe you ask?&nbsp; The Champ Cars would run the wonderful F1 standard road course
      at each of those tracks instead of the oval.&nbsp; Motegi, Japan and
      Eurospeedway, Germany have exceptional road courses.&nbsp; I am not as
      certain about Rockingham.&nbsp; I am of the opinion that CART will draw
      larger crowds at those races if they were run on the road courses because
      the fans in those countries identify with road racing more.&nbsp; However,
      if the oval races prove successful this year, then perhaps CART can stick
      to the ovals in England and Germany and use the IRL/Lights cars.&nbsp; Not
      in Japan, however, as Motegi is owned by Honda and they will want their
      engines in the race.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I propose that the IRL
      sanction all the USA Indy Car oval races each year, CART the road races, and CART and the IRL
      together co-sanction a resurrected Triple Crown series (Indy, Michigan and Fontana)
      whereby drivers from both series compete together each year for big prize
      money using IRL/Indy Lights cars.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In addition to the three
      Triple Crown races, CART teams that buy those cars run them or sell them
      for a support series for CART and the IRL, identical in every way, except
      one.&nbsp; I propose that the support series have a smaller bore size to
      reduce the displacement of the engine by 0.5 liters.&nbsp; That would require boring the block to a
      smaller cylinder diameter, and a different cam profile and engine
      computer mapping, but the engines would be required to be identical to IRL
      engines in every other aspect.&nbsp; The question that immediately comes
      to mind is the fact that Indy Lights has always been a one-manufacturer
      engine formula.&nbsp; However, NASCAR does not do that with its support
      series, Trucks and Busch.&nbsp; By having multiple manufacturers, you
      bring more interest to the support series, something that Indy Lights
      desperately needs.&nbsp; To keep costs further in check, perhaps the
      Lights engines can have a rev limit of 10,000 instead of 10,700 RPM to
      increase the miles between rebuilds.&nbsp; Another issue is
      transmissions.&nbsp;</font><font size="2" face="Arial">The current IRL transmission
      would hold up just fine to the demands of road course racing, however, for outright car performance and regulation
      requirements a differential and reverse gear may be required. The only other
      area which may require some investigation is the lubrication scavenge system, as at present it is
      optimized for oval running.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">A 3.0L engine will produce
      less HP than the 3.5L IRL engine.&nbsp; Therefore, the cars will be
      slightly slower, as they should be for a support series.&nbsp; I would
      estimate that the HP will be in the 550 HP level, a good target for the
      Lights series with that weight car.&nbsp; The Lights series would then
      have cars that were the same size as their bigger brother, the IRL and
      Champ Cars.&nbsp; Busch cars are the same physical size as Winston Cup
      cars, and so too should Lights cars be the same size as their bigger
      brother IRL and Champ cars.&nbsp; By having Lights cars identical to IRL
      cars, drivers can be more easily persuaded to run both series as their schedules allow, which will be
      another shot in the arm the support series needs.&nbsp; Winston Cup
      drivers help out the Busch and Truck series in a similar way.&nbsp; Why is
      it that Cup drivers can do it yet, IRL and Champ car drivers can't?&nbsp;
      They certainly can, and would be more inclined to do so if the Lights cars
      were the same physical size as their IRL or Champ cars so as not to seem
      it's such a step down for them.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">This proposal also means that
      all the engine manufacturers that produce engines for the IRL series,
      could, without a significant cost increase, produce Indy Lights
      engines......if they so choose.&nbsp; Toyota, Oldsmobile and Nissan have
      already committed to the new IRL engine formula for 2003.&nbsp; Would
      Toyota also produce a 1.8 liter turbo Champ Car engine?&nbsp; Maybe, maybe
      not.&nbsp; If they think a strong Champ Car road racing series that gives
      them excellent North America and International exposure is worth producing
      an engine for CART too, they will.&nbsp; It would be up to CART to clearly
      define its road racing market niche, do an excellent job promoting it,
      have a solid TV package and make it valuable enough to entice Toyota and
      other manufacturers.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Conversely, would Ford and
      Honda also choose to produce IRL and Lights engines?&nbsp; We doubt it, at
      least not immediately.&nbsp; However, neither manufacturer is at Indy now
      anyway, so nothing would be lost except their Champ Car drivers would have
      a different engine for the three Triple Crown races each year.&nbsp;By
      eliminating 500-mile high speed ovals, the manufacturers of CART's engines
      won't have to produce so many various versions of the same engine, so that
      will reduce their costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
      CART does their job right, their road racing focused series would give Ford,
      Honda, and hopefully some new manufacturers, better value than they get
      today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Below is a proposed 2004 CART,
      IRL and Lights schedule that attempts to avoid having the IRL and CART
      race on the same day as much as possible, resurrects a joint CART/IRL
      Triple crown and has Lights supporting both CART and the IRL.&nbsp; It's a
      24-race CART schedule, a 17-race IRL schedule and a 14- race Lights
      schedule.&nbsp; The Lights schedule is two races longer than it currently
      is to attract more sponsor interest, plus the cars are used in the three
      Triple Crown races with the bigger 3.5L engines.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">You will see some new races on
      the both the CART and IRL schedule, ones I feel should be added, or have
      been rumored to be coming.&nbsp; Likewise, I had to make some very hard
      decisions, but you will see some existing
      races dropped, either because of poor attendance, declining attendance or
      inadequate track width and/or safety.&nbsp; The Toyota Atlantic series would also support the
      CART series, but now there would be a larger step up from Atlantics to
      Lights in CART's ladder.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Conclusion</b> - What I
      have presented is a way for CART and F1 to coexist peacefully.&nbsp; The world
      is plenty big enough for both to exist and the demand is there that F1
      alone can't satisfy.&nbsp; More importantly, what I
      have presented is a way for CART and the IRL to co-exist peacefully, one
      an oval series and one a road racing series, neither being threatened by
      the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"> The entities would jointly promote 'Indy Car' racing,
      especially the Triple Crown races when they race together.&nbsp; I have
      avoided both series racing on the same day (except two, but that's when
      CART is overseas in China and Germany).&nbsp; What I have presented allows
      CART and the IRL to go together to ABC and ESPN and present a 37-race schedule much
      like NASCAR offers, a race on almost every Sunday by either series.&nbsp;
      I have presented a way to generate more interest in the Indy Lights
      series. I have presented a way for CART drivers to race in the coveted
      Indy 500 with what I think is an economically feasible way.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I have also presented a way
      for Indy Car fans to enjoy their type of motorsports almost every weekend,
      just like NASCAR fans get to do, without TV programming conflicts.&nbsp;
      And most importantly, I hope I have presented something for all the
      constituents in CART and the IRL to gain from a stronger IRL and
      CART series.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now if we can only convince
      Tony George and CART to merge together under one organization called
      'IndyCar', the name CART used to have.&nbsp; Similar to Football's and
      Baseball's American and National Leagues, Tony George would have full
      control of the IRL/oval races, the CART owners would have full control of
      the CART/road races.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"> I would propose that one person be
      selected to be the Commissioner of IndyCar racing.&nbsp; A person that
      would be jointly elected by the IRL and CART to lead a governing body for
      IndyCar racing, much like the FIA has a Max Mosley that steers F1, F3000
      and other series.&nbsp; That person must be someone who is respected
      worldwide by the racing community, is well respected by the sponsors,
      commands a presence when he walks into the room, can be neutral, and wants
      to see CART and the IRL co-exist under one umbrella.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Roger Penske is the one person
      who may have all the right qualities to pull the two sides together, and
      do for CART and the IRL what he has done for all the businesses he has
      touched - turned them golden.&nbsp; He's not a CART Board member, no
      longer owns any tracks, and is sincere when he says CART and the IRL
      should operate under one umbrella. His only conflict of interest may be
      that he's a CART team owner, but I view that as a positive since he
      understands what it takes to run a racing operation.&nbsp; Penske has
      built all his businesses around racing.&nbsp; Just as Honda is a racing
      company that happens to also sell passenger cars; Penske is a racing man
      first and foremost, one that just happens to also run very successful
      automotive related businesses.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Unfortunately, Roger has too
      many business interests to give up to devote himself fulltime to the
      unified IndyCar organization......and that's too bad for all of us.</font></p>
