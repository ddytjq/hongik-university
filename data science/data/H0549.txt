<P>The tropism of a particular virus is defined by the species, and
more particularly the tissues within a given species, that are
capable of supporting a productive infection by that virus. Viruses
rely extensively on host cell factors, including not only cell
surface receptors but also a range of intracellular cofactors, for
the successful completion of their life cycle. Therefore, they are
unable to replicate effectively in differentiated cells that fail to
express a particular cofactor or in species, distinct from their
normal host(s), that express a variant form of an essential cofactor
that is not capable of supporting a critical macromolecular
interaction. The more cellular cofactors a particular virus is
dependent on, the more constrained will be the pattern of permissive
species and differentiated cell types. Human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 (HIV-1) displays a remarkably narrow tropism in terms of not
only the range of species, but also the range of tissues within a
particular species, that are permissive for this pathogenic
virus.</P>

<P>Understanding the molecular basis of HIV-1 tropism is important
for several reasons. Firstly, the tissue tropism of primary HIV-1
isolates derived from individual patients has been shown to be
predictive of both cytopathicity in culture and disease progression
(Connor <I>et al</I>., 1997; Schuitemaker <I>et al</I>., 1992;
Schramm <I>et al</I>., 2000). Understanding how tissue tropism is
regulated, and how it evolves in infected individuals, therefore has
the potential to improve the treatment of AIDS patients. Secondly, it
would be extremely useful to have an animal model system, preferably
a rodent model, that recreates the pattern of HIV-1 induced disease
seen in infected humans. This is not feasible unless we can use
transgenic approaches to repair the various molecular defects in the
mouse, or other rodents, that currently render them non-permissive
for HIV-1. Finally, the inability of a particular tissue or species
to support HIV-1 replication provides a genetic tool to define
cellular cofactors that are critical for specific steps in the viral
life cycle. This has already facilitated the identification of
cellular cofactors required for HIV-1 entry or transcription (Feng
<I>et al</I>., 1996; Wei <I>et al</I>., 1998) and has the potential
to identify other cellular cofactors involved in several other phases
of the viral replication cycle. The identification and molecular
characterization of these HIV-1 cofactors would in turn provide
potential targets for the development of novel antiviral agents.</P>

<P>This article is primarily intended for scientists who have a good
understanding of the various phases of the replication cycle of
HIV-1. Other readers are directed to recent reviews describing the
early phase of the viral replication cycle (Doms &amp; Trono, 2000),
the role of HIV-1 regulatory and auxiliary proteins (Cullen, 1998)
and the steps in virion assembly and release (Freed, 1998).</P>

<H2><B>Species Tropism of HIV-1</B></H2>

<H3><B>1. Infection of cells from non-human primates</B></H3>

<P>All HIV-1 isolates recovered from humans appear to have evolved
from a small number of zoonotic infections of humans by chimpanzee
simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVCPZ) (Gao <I>et al</I>., 1999).
Therefore, it is not surprising that HIV-1 will replicate in both
chimpanzee lymphoid cells and in chimpanzees themselves, although it
does not generally cause disease when reintroduced into its species
of origin. Surprisingly, however, HIV-1 replicates poorly in monkey
cells, including in cells derived from rhesus macaques, the major
primate experimental animal.</P>

<P>Attempts to infect macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) with HIV-1 revealed that infection was blocked at a very early
stage, prior to completion of reverse transcription (Shibata <I>et
al</I>., 1991; Himathongkham &amp; Luciw, 1996). Surprisingly, this
defect was not, however, due to a problem in the HIV-1 envelope (Env)
protein, as shown by two lines of evidence. Firstly, a
macaque-derived SIV (SIVMAC) pseudotyped with the HIV-1 Env protein
proved to be fully capable of infecting macaque PBMCs (Chackerian
<I>et al</I>., 1997). Secondly, chimeric viruses constructed from
SIVMAC and HIV-1, so-called SHIVs, that contained the HIV-1
<I>tat</I>, <I>vpu</I>, <I>env </I>and <I>rev</I> genes in an
otherwise SIVMAC context, proved fully replication competent on
macaque PBMCs (Shibata <I>et al</I>., 1995). Subsequent efforts to
genetically define the gene product in HIV-1 that is non-functional
in macaque PBMC have shown that this defect maps to HIV-1 <I>gag</I>
and/or <I>pol</I> (Shibata <I>et al</I>., 1995). More recently, it
has been demonstrated that substitution of a small fragment of
<I>gag</I>, termed the capsid-p2 domain, from HIV-1 into SIVMAC
confers a species tropism similar to that of HIV-1, <I>i.e</I>. this
chimera can replicate in human but not macaque cells (Dorfman &amp;
Gottlinger, 1996). Unfortunately, the converse experiment has not
been reported, i.e. rescue of HIV replication in simian PBMC by the
SIV capsid-p2 sequence. Nevertheless, these data in sum argue that
the Gag protein is likely to be the major determinant of HIV-1
primate species specificity.</P>

<P>While the host cell factor(s) that determines the primate species
specificity of HIV-1 remains to be unequivocally established, one
paper has suggested that it might be the co-receptor itself. Thus,
Chackerian <I>et al</I>. (1997) reported that while several HIV-1
isolates were unable to infect macaque cells expressing human CD4,
these same macaque cells became fully permissive for infection when
they also expressed the relevant human co-receptor (see below for
overview of co-receptor function). Therefore, these data imply that a
primate species-specific block to infection that maps to the HIV-1
Gag protein can be overcome by expressing human CD4 and human
co-receptor on macaque cells! While this result is at present
difficult to understand, it may suggest a critical role for
co-receptors during the early phase of the viral replication cycle
but after virion entry.</P>

<P>While the Gag protein appears to be a key determinant of HIV-1
species tropism, other viral gene products appear likely to also
constrain not only the primate species tropism of HIV-1 but also the
ability of SIV variants to productively infect human cells. For
example, Simon <I>et al</I>. (1998b) have demonstrated that the Vif
proteins derived from an African green monkey SIV isolate (SIVAGM) or
from Sykes' monkey SIV (SIVSYK) are not functional in human cells.
Because Vif function is critical for both HIV-1 and SIV replication
in primary cells (Gabuzda <I>et al</I>., 1992), the inability of the
Vif proteins encoded by SIVAGM and SIVSYK to function in human cells
would be predicted to be sufficient to preclude productive infection
by these simian viruses. Similarly, Stivahtis <I>et al</I>. (1997)
have shown that the Vpr proteins from SIVAGM and SIVSYK are incapable
of blocking cell cycle progression in human cells, although both
proteins, as well as HIV-1 Vpr, are active in simian cells. These
data not only indicate that auxiliary proteins also play a role in
controlling the primate species tropism of primate lentiviruses but
also may explain why SIVAGM and SIVSYK appear to differ from SIVCPZ
and sooty mangabey SIV (the progenitor of HIV-2; Gao <I>et al</I>.,
1999) in not causing zoonotic infections in humans (Simon <I>et
al</I>., 1998b). As neither the cofactor for Vif function nor for
Vpr-mediated cell cycle arrest has as yet been clearly identified,
the molecular basis for the primate species specificity of these
viral proteins remains unexplained. However, the inability of, for
example, SIVAGM Vif and Vpr to function in human cells may provide a
simple way to validate candidate cellular cofactors for these two
important HIV-1 auxiliary proteins.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><B>2. HIV-1 Infection of rodent cells </B></H3>

<P>Given that monkey cells are not permissive for HIV-1 replication,
one might predict that more distantly related mammalian species, such
as rodents, would be at least equivalently refractory. Indeed, it has
been clear for some time that HIV-1 is unable to infect rodent cells,
even when these have been engineered to express human CD4 (Ashorn
<I>et al</I>., 1990; Clapham <I>et al</I>., 1991; Maddon <I>et
al</I>., 1986). Further, it has also been known for several years
that the HIV-1 Tat protein, an essential viral transcription factor,
is not functional in either mouse or hamster cells, thus precluding
significant levels of viral gene expression (Newstein <I>et al</I>.,
1990; Alonso <I>et al</I>., 1992).</P>

<P>Although the inability of murine cells to be infected by HIV-1 or
to support HIV-1 Tat-dependent transcription formed a major hurdle to
the development of rodents as models for the study of HIV-1
pathogenesis, this defect also presented a potential way to identify
and/or validate the human proteins that mediate these functions.
Thus, the first HIV-1 co-receptor, now termed CXCR4, was initially
cloned by Feng <I>et al</I>. (1996) by identifying a human cDNA that
allowed fusion of murine NIH 3T3 cells expressing human CD4 with
cells engineered to express a T-tropic HIV-1 Env protein. While the
HIV-1 Tat cofactor, termed Cyclin T1, was in contrast identified by
biochemical purification, it was only truly validated by the
demonstration that expression of human cyclin T1 in rodent cells
fully rescues HIV-1 Tat function (Wei <I>et al</I>., 1998).
Interestingly, subsequent analysis has demonstrated that while murine
CCR5 is indeed unable to support cell fusion mediated by CCR5
(R5)-tropic HIV-1 Env proteins, murine CXCR4 is actually fully
competent to support CXCR4 (X4)-tropic Env dependent cell fusion
(Bieniasz <I>et al</I>., 1997). However, murine CXCR4 is not
expressed on most murine cell lines, including NIH 3T3. In contrast,
murine cyclin T1 was shown to be unable to support HIV-1 Tat function
due to the substitution of a critical cysteine residue, found in
human cyclin T1, with tyrosine. Although murine cyclin T1 is able to
bind to the HIV-1 Tat protein essentially normally, the lack of this
critical cysteine prevents recruitment of the resultant Tat:cyclin T1
heterodimer to TAR, the cis-acting target for HIV-1 Tat function
(Garber <I>et al</I>., 1998; Bieniasz <I>et al</I>., 1998)</P>

<P>Having identified the cellular receptor and co-receptor for the
HIV-1 Env protein, and with the cellular Tat cofactor also known, it
seemed possible that it might now be possible to render rodent cells
permissive for HIV-1 by simply engineering rodent cells to express
all three of these human proteins. However, this has not proven to be
the case and it instead appears that rodent cells lack at least one,
and possibly several additional factors required for the effective
replication of HIV-1.</P>

<P>Two groups have extensively investigated the ability of rodent
cells to support the replication of HIV-1 in culture. An initial
report (Mariani <I>et al</I>., 2000), focused entirely on the murine
cell line NIH 3T3, reported that mouse cells expressing human CD4 and
co-receptor could be infected by HIV-1, albeit with reduced
efficiency compared to human cells. The initial steps of the viral
life cycle, i.e. penetration, reverse transcription, proviral
integration and transcription, all proceeded efficiently in NIH 3T3
cells expressing human receptors and cyclin T1. However, the later
stages of the viral replication cycle, particular including virion
assembly and release, were very inefficient. A minor (~3 fold) drop
in the relative abundance of the unspliced HIV-1 transcript was noted
in HIV-1 infected NIH 3T3 cells, probably reflecting oversplicing of
HIV-1 transcripts in rodent cells. However, the major problems were a
drop in the efficiency of proteolytic processing of the HIV-1 Gag
protein and a dramatic, and probably related, decrease in the release
of HIV-1 virions. However, the small number of virions released did
appear to be fully infectious. This study (Mariani <I>et al</I>.,
2000) therefore suggested that murine cells were defective for HIV-1
replication primarily because they were unable to assemble HIV-1
virions effectively.</P>

<P>A second report (Bieniasz &amp; Cullen, 2000) extended these
earlier data to additional murine cell lines and also to rat and
hamster cell lines. In contrast to Mariani <I>et al</I>. (2000),
Bieniasz and Cullen (2000) reported that NIH 3T3 cells, as well as
Rat 2 cells, were only poorly infectable by wild-type HIV-1 even when
they expressed high levels of human CD4 and co-receptor. In contrast,
hamster (CHO) cells supported HIV-1 infection as effectively as did
human cells. This report did, however, confirm that the early steps
of the HIV-1 life cycle, through proviral transcription, proceeded
efficiently in rodent cells expressing a functional cyclin T1 protein
if the infecting HIV-1 virions were pseudotyped with the G envelope
protein from vesicular stomatitis virus.</P>

<P>In agreement with Mariani <I>et al</I>. (2000), Bieniasz and
Cullen (2000) also saw modestly reduced levels of unspliced HIV-1 RNA
and a significant drop in the efficiency of Gag polyprotein
processing in most, but not all, rodent cell lines tested. Virion
release was found to be very inefficient for murine and rat cells,
although less affected in hamster cells. However, in disagreement
with the earlier work of Mariani <I>et al</I>. (2000), these workers
noted a significant drop in the infectivity of virions released from
rat and mouse cells when compared to hamster and, particularly, human
cells. Finally, Bieniasz and Cullen (2000) reported that HIV-1
replication in rodent cells could be rescued by fusion to human
cells, thus indicating that rodent cells lack one or more cofactors
(in addition to receptors and cyclin T1) that are essential for
critical aspects in the HIV-1 replication cycle, including
particularly virion assembly and release.</P>

<P>More recently, Mariani <I>et al</I>., (2001) have extended their
earlier work to other rodent cell lines with largely similar results.
This more recent paper again reported only a small drop (~3 fold),
relative to human cells, in the efficiency with which rodent cells
bearing human CD4 and co-receptor can be infected. In addition, these
workers extended and confirmed their earlier observation that HIV-1
virions released from a range of rodent cell lines were fully
infectious. In agreement with Bieniasz and Cullen (2000), these
workers also reported that HIV-1 can effectively replicate in
human:mouse heterokaryons and that the hamster cell line CHO is
significantly more permissive than either mouse or rat cells in
supporting HIV-1 replication.</P>

<P>In conclusion, these three studies all indicate that rodent cells
have a severe defect in the assembly and release of HIV-1 virions
that is a recessive phenotype in mouse:human heterokaryons. In
addition, there appears to be some deficiency in the ability of HIV-1
to utilize human receptors on the surface of rodent cells as well as
a modest reduction in the level of Gag mRNA production when compared
to human cells. The issue of whether the infectivity of HIV-1 virions
released from rodent cells is attenuated remains to be resolved.
However, if HIV-1 virions released from rodent cells are indeed fully
infectious, then this would imply either that the HIV-1 Vif protein
is fully active in rodent cells or that the cellular factor expressed
in some, but not all, human cells that blocks the replication of Vif
deficient HIV-1 (Simon <I>et al</I>., 1998a) is absent in rodent
cells. In any case, it is clear that these defects, in total, are
presently sufficient to preclude the spread of HIV-1 in cultures of
rodent cells engineered to express human CD4, co-receptors and cyclin
T1. The identification of the human cofactor(s) required for
successful assembly and release of HIV-1 virions, that is apparently
lacking in all rodent cell types, is clearly an essential
prerequisite for the future establishment of a small animal model to
study HIV-1 pathogenesis.</P>

<H2><B>Tissue Tropism of HIV-1</B></H2>

<H3><B>1. Molecular basis for HIV-1 tissue tropism</B></H3>

<P>The majority of research into the molecular biology of HIV-1 has
used three related laboratory isolates termed IIIB, LAI (or BRU) and
NL4-3. The IIIB and LAI isolates are very closely related while the
3' half of the chimeric NL4-3 provirus, including the critical <I>env
</I>gene, is derived from LAI. As a result, these three laboratory
isolates are very similar to one another in terms of their biological
properties.</P>

<P>Both IIIB and LAI were derived after passage of virus derived from
a single AIDS patient on CD4+ human T cell lines. It is now clear
that passage of primary virus isolates on transformed T cells selects
for several related phenotypes. These include a high affinity for CD4
and high sensitivity to neutralization by both soluble CD4 and by
certain monoclonal antibodies. These properties correlate with the
ability to grow on a range of CD4+ T cell lines, loss of the ability
to grow on primary macrophages and induction of syncitia during
replication on either T cell lines or primary T cells. This
constellation of phenotypes was historically referred to as T cell or
T-tropism. In contrast, most primary HIV-1 isolates, particularly at
earlier stages of infection, are unable to grow on T cell lines, but
do grow on primary macrophages and T cells. Primary viruses also
generally do not form syncitia in culture, are resistant to
neutralization by both soluble CD4 and antibodies and have a lower
affinity for CD4 (Daar <I>et al</I>., 1990; Schuitemaker <I>et
al</I>., 1991, 1992; Hwang <I>et al</I>., 1992; Moore &amp; Ho, 1995;
Kozak <I>et al</I>., 1997; Wrin <I>et al</I>., 1995; Platt <I>et
al</I>., 2000). This constellation of phenotypes was originally
referred to as macrophage or M-tropism, although M-tropic HIV-1
isolates do retain the ability to grow on primary T cells. It is
important to emphasize that many viruses are actually intermediate in
phenotype between the extreme forms of T-tropism and M-tropism
defined here.</P>

<P>Efforts to identify the gene in HIV-1 that controlled these
interrelated phenotypes rapidly led to the demonstration that these
properties all mapped to the viral <I>env </I>gene (O'Brien <I>et
al</I>., 1990; Shioda <I>et al</I>., 1991). More detailed mutational
analyses subsequently revealed that the primary determinant of HIV-1
tissue tropism lay in the third variable, or V3, domain of the gp120
subunit of Env (Hwang <I>et al</I>., 1991, 1992; Fouchier <I>et
al</I>., 1992; Chesebro <I>et al</I>., 1996) although regions in the
first or second variable domain could also modulate tissue tropism to
a lesser degree (Boyd <I>et al</I>., 1993; Koito <I>et al</I>.,
1994).</P>

<P>The ability of T-tropic HIV-1 to replicate on T cell lines and
primary T cells, while M-tropic HIV-1 could replicate only on primary
T cells and macrophages, led to the hypothesis that there were two
co-receptors required for HIV-1 infection in addition to CD4. In this
hypothesis, T cell lines would only express co-receptor A, primary
macrophages would express only co-receptor B and primary CD4+ T cells
would express both co-receptors. The identification of CXCR4 as the
co-receptor for T-tropic HIV-1 (Feng <I>et al</I>., 1996), while CCR5
was found to be the primary co-receptor for M-tropic HIV-1 (Alkhatib
<I>et al</I>., 1996; Choe <I>et al</I>., 1996; Deng <I>et al</I>.,
1996; Dragic <I>et al</I>., 1996), seemed initially to fully confirm
this hypothesis. Indeed, CCR5 was found not to be expressed on
transformed T cell lines, thus explaining why these could not support
M-tropic virus replication.</P>

<P>It soon became apparent, however, that the molecular basis for
HIV-1 tissue tropism could not be as simple as originally envisioned.
Specifically, many primary M-tropic viruses were actually found to be
able to use either CCR5 or CXCR4 as a co-receptor, or were even
entirely CXCR4 (X4)-tropic. Nevertheless, many of these X4-tropic
primary viruses were unable to grow effectively on CXCR4 expressing
CD4+ T cell lines yet were able to grow on primary macrophages which,
it now emerged, did indeed express a low level of CXCR4 (Simmons
<I>et al</I>., 1998; Verani <I>et al</I>., 1998; Yi <I>et al</I>.,
1998, 1999).</P>

<P>The question therefore became, why do X4-tropic primary HIV-1
isolates fail to replicate on T-cell lines that support replication
by X4-tropic laboratory-adapted HIV-1 isolates and, conversely, why
do the latter fail to replicate on primary macrophages that are
permissive for primary HIV-1 X4 isolates? It now seems clear that the
major, but perhaps not the only, determinant of these phenotypes is
the relative affinity of viral Env proteins for the CD4 receptor and
the CXCR4 co-receptor. As noted above, laboratory adaptation of
primary viruses involves acquisition of a higher affinity for CD4
(Platt <I>et al</I>., 2000). As predicted, increased expression of
CD4 on T cell lines was therefore able to at least partially rescue
the ability of primary X4-tropic viruses to replicate on these
transformed cells (Kozak <I>et al</I>., 1997; Platt <I>et al</I>.,
2000). Similarly, it has recently been demonstrated that the
inability of the T-tropic SIV isolate mac239 to replicate on primary
simian macrophages can be rescued by increased expression of CD4
(Bannert <I>et al</I>., 2000).</P>

<P>Given that the inability of primary X-4 tropic HIV-1 to replicate
on T cell lines largely reflects a low affinity for CD4, could the
failure of laboratory adapted, X4-tropic viruses to replicate on
primary macrophages be due to poor utilization of low levels of
CXCR4? In fact, it has now been demonstrated that overexpression of
CXCR4 on primary macrophages largely rescues both fusion with, and
infection by, laboratory adapted X4-tropic HIV-1 (Dimitrov <I>et
al</I>., 1999; Tokunaga <I>et al</I>., 2001).</P>

<P>Together, these data indicate that the relative affinity for CD4
and co-receptor may be a major rate limiting step in the efficiency
of virus replication in culture. Interestingly, this also appears
likely to be true in infected patients. For example, HIV-1 infected
individuals that express lower levels of the co-receptor CCR5 have
been shown to progress significantly more slowly than individuals
that express high levels of CCR5 (Huang <I>et al</I>., 1996; Michael
<I>et al</I>., 1997; Reynes <I>et al</I>., 2001). More generally,
these observations suggest that the selective pressures acting on
HIV-1 in the infected host may select not only for the ability to
utilize other co-receptors but also for HIV-1 sequence variants able
to infect target cell subsets that express suboptimal levels of CD4
or co-receptor. Such evolved viruses might be predicted to be
potentially more fit than the initial infecting virus and, hence,
more pathogenic (Quinones-Mateu <I>et al</I>., 2000). The appearance
of an expanded cell tropism upon selection for ability to utilize
very low levels of the co-receptor CCR5 has in fact been documented
in vitro (Dejucq <I>et al</I>., 1999) and similar selection pressures
may well exist in vivo, with similar results.</P>

<P>While the relative ability to use rate-limiting concentrations of
CD4 or co-receptor therefore appears to be the primary determinant of
HIV-1 tissue tropism, it is unlikely to be the only one (Gorry <I>et
al</I>., 2001). Which other mechanism(s) could influence this process
remains to be determined, although it has been suggested that the
ability of the viral Env protein to signal via a co-receptor
(Weissman <I>et al</I>., 1997; Liu <I>et al</I>., 2000) or to use
antigenically distinct, tissue specific variants of CXCR4 (Lapham
<I>et al</I>., 1999; Baribaud <I>et al</I>., 2001) may influence
HIV-1 tissue tropism. </P>

<H3><B>2. HIV-1 tissue tropism and disease progression</B></H3>

<P>With few exceptions, viruses isolated during the initial phase of
human infection are M-tropic viruses that exclusively utilize CCR5 as
a co-receptor. However, during disease progression, highly
cytopathic, T-tropic viruses that utilize CXCR4 as a co-receptor
either in addition to, or instead of, CCR5 can evolve (Schuitemaker
<I>et al</I>., 1991, 1992; Connor and Ho 1994; Connor <I>et al</I>.,
1997; Van't Wout <I>et al</I>., 1994; Schramm <I>et al</I>., 2000).
While CXCR4-tropic viruses eventually appear in up to 50% of patients
infected with the subtype B viruses prevalent in the USA and western
Europe, the incidence of CXCR4-tropism appears to be much lower in
patients infected with subtype C, even though this widely distributed
subtype appears equally pathogenic (Abebe <I>et al</I>., 1999; Ping
<I>et al</I>., 1999). In any event, the observed increase in viral
cytopathicity during disease progression appears to be encoded
entirely within the <I>env </I>gene and correlates with changes in
co-receptor usage (Kreisberg <I>et al</I>., 2001). An unresolved and
important question is: why are the initial viruses generally M-tropic
and why do T-tropic viruses appear over time?</P>

<P>One possible way to view this issue is that viral properties that
enhance the likelihood of, particularly, sexual transmission may well
be quite distinct from the properties that enhance viral replicative
capacity in the infected host. Therefore, HIV-1 may evolve in the
host in a way that actually selects against properties that enhance
viral transmission frequency. Unfortunately, the factors that
regulate this critical step remain largely unknown, although the
simple hypothesis that M-tropic viruses are transmitted more
effectively than T-tropic viruses because the first cells infected in
the new host are macrophages appears to be incorrect (Schacker <I>et
al</I>., 2001). In fact, even in individuals initially infected with
T-tropic viruses that utilize CXCR4, selection for ability to
replicate in macrophages occurs, even though this does not
necessarily involve a change in co-receptor specificity (Beaumont
<I>et al</I>., 2001). Therefore, it is clear that a major component
of selection for M-tropism during the early phase of infection is
actually subsequent to transmission. Presumably, M-tropic viruses
predominate early because they replicate more effectively than
T-tropic viruses in the available target cells and/or because the
host is able to control T-tropic virus infection more readily at this
early disease stage.</P>

<P>As noted above, many patients at later disease stages evolve HIV-1
variants that are T-tropic and use CXCR4 as a co-receptor. The
appearance of T-tropic viruses clearly correlates with more rapid
disease progression, although it is still not clear that this
correlation implies causation. Nevertheless, a number of groups have
reported that these late, T-tropic viruses are more cytopathic in
vitro (Berkowitz <I>et al</I>., 1998; Grivel <I>et al</I>., 2000;
Schramm <I>et al</I>., 2000; Kwa <I>et al</I>., 2001) although
X4-tropic viruses are not necessarily more replication competent than
R5-tropic viruses in culture (Quinones-Mateu <I>et al</I>., 2000).
The appearance of X4-tropic HIV-1 therefore likely results from
selection for an expanded target cell tropism, perhaps allowing HIV-1
to infect and kill additional T cell subsets that are not readily
susceptible to infection with R5-tropic viruses, such as the naive
CD4+ T cell subset that expresses low levels of CCR5 but readily
detectable levels of CXCR4 (Bleul <I>et al</I>., 1997; Blaak <I>et
al</I>., 2000; van Rij <I>et al</I>., 2000; Kwa <I>et al</I>., 2001).
This change in tropism, by allowing HIV-1 to target novel, but
potentially less optimal, T cell subpopulations that have not been
depleted by the pre-existing R5 viruses, presumably supplies the
selective pressure not only for the appearance, but also the
maintenance, of X4-tropic viruses. A prediction of this hypothesis is
that a reduction in viral load should reverse the selective pressures
that favor the persistence of X4-tropic HIV-1 isolates by increasing
the number of cells that are susceptible to R5-tropic viruses. In
fact, it has now been documented that antiviral therapy indeed
results in the preferential suppression of X4-tropic HIV-1 in
infected patients (Equils <I>et al</I>., 2000; Philpott <I>et
al</I>., 2001). In any event, although the appearance of T-tropic,
CXCR4 utilizing viruses is clearly predictive of more rapid disease
progression, it should be remembered that many patients progress to
AIDS without evolving T-tropic viruses. Therefore, antivirals
targeted exclusively at CXCR4-dependent viruses would appear likely
to at best delay disease progression.</P>

<H2><B>Conclusion</B></H2>

<P>Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying HIV-1 species and
tissue tropism, and the consequences of changes in the latter for
disease progression, remains far from complete. In the case of
species tropism, the molecular basis for the inability of HIV-1 to
replicate in simian cells remains obscure. On the other hand,
resolution of two problems limiting replication in rodent cells,
<I>i.e.</I>, the identification of HIV-1 co-receptors and of the
cofactor for HIV-1 Tat, has merely facilitated the identification of
other steps in the viral life cycle that are abortive in rodent
cells. While the inability of HIV-1 to replicate in non-human cells
offers the potential to identify additional human factors that are
essential for HIV-1 replication, it appears that we are far from
being able to construct a rodent model of HIV-1 pathogenesis. In the
absence of a good animal model, progress in understanding how the
evolution of HIV-1 tissue tropism affects viral pathogenicity in vivo
will clearly be difficult, although the use of SHIVs containing
different HIV-1 <I>env </I>genes may be helpful. Nevertheless, I
would argue that intensified efforts to understand the tropisms
displayed by HIV-1 will not only shed light on critical steps in the
viral life cycle but also lead to the development of tools useful in
the development of novel antiviral agents.</P>
