<p> A powerful telescope beyond the atmosphere promised vast improvements
in our knowledge of almost every area of astronomy. 
It still seemed a very distant prospect when I began my research career.
After a long period
of lobbying, development, and planning, the Hubble Space Telescope
was carried into space in April 1990 by the space shuttle Discovery
during mission 
<a href="http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/chron/sts-31.htm">STS-31</a>.
Indeed, the Hubble telescope
has revolutionized virtually every field of astronomy, from planetary
science through stellar evolution to gamma-ray bursts. It has been my
remarkably good fortune to be involved in programs using HST data
going back to its first year of operation.</p>

<br>

<center> <b>The Blurry Old Days</b></center>
<br>
<p> It's almost too painful to recount - the announcement of significant
spherical aberration in the primary mirror, and the realization that
some kinds of anticipated HST science (quasar host galaxies, for example)
simply could not be done in that condition. Still, some kinds of
programs could be carried out, particularly UV spectroscopy and some
kinds of imaging for which deconvolution with the telescope's strongly
peaked and stable (although degraded) point-spread function. Working
with Rogier Windhorst and collaborators, I did some deconvolution
of faint radio galaxies from redshifts z=0.3 to 2.4, to study how well
we could reconstruct their structures. Much of this was done with the
<a href="http://crux.astr.ua.edu/keel/sigmaclean">sigma-CLEAN algorithm</a>, 
adapting the basic procedure from radio astronomy
to the different behavior of photon noise in optical data. In 1991, this
took a Cray supercomputer (how times have changed!). I show here a couple
of examples from this project. The radio galaxy 53W044 at z=0.31 is
revealed to have a nearby companion and a faint, smooth stellar
disk. The bright star in the same field furnishes a very convenient
reference for the blurring pattern (known in the business as the point-spread 
function or PSF). These I-band images cover a region 20 arcseconds
square, and are shown at the same intensity 
scale for comparison.</p>

<p> We continued this work in the third cycle of HST programs, now
using the parallel imaging and spectroscopic capabilities of the
observatory to seek evidence of how radio galaxies evolve with
cosmic time. Evolution should be most pronounced in the ultraviolet,
where the hotter and shorter-lived stars are most prominent. We chose
pairs of radio galaxies from the Leiden-Berkeley Deep Survey with
appropriate redshifts, selected so that while measuring the UV spectrum 
of one galaxy with the Faint-Object Spectrograph (FOS), we could 
obtain a visible-light image of another using the Wide Field/Planetary
Camera (WF/PC). Then, about six months later, we could reverse the order
and end up with images of the whole sample, important to interpreting the
intensity of the spectrum, at no additional cost in telescope time.
In fact, these fields also let us begin a statistical study of the pairing 
and merging of faint galaxies as a by-product.</p>

<br>
<center><b>Sharper than ever</b></center>

<p> The real possibilities of the Hubble telescope, of course, were
evident only after the 1993 refurbishment mission on 
<a href="http://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/chron/sts-61.htm">STS-61</a>, 
which installed optics to correct the
images for the two spectrographs and Faint-Object Camera, plus
replacing WF/PC with WFPC2. We reobserved the area around 53W002,
to prove the structure of this weak, distant radio galaxy, which
we hoped could serve as a sample of what elliptical galaxies
looked like soon after formation. After ground-based observations
showed that 53W002 had companions at the same redshift, we were
able to get a long set of WFPC2 observations through a filter which
isolates Lyman alpha emission at this redshift (the filter having been
intended to study methane absorption on giant planets). This hit the jackpot,
turning up about 18 objects that could be gas-rich companions, the richest
high-redshift grouping found to date. These objects were extraordinary
not only in their UV energy output, implying brisk formation of
massive stars, but in their small size, typically only a few thousand 
light-years in extent. Thus we termed them sub-galactic, with the idea
that such objects (later turned up in some numbers in the Hubble Deep Field)
might be the precursors out of which today's larger, more massive
galaxies have been built up. For more details and image comparisons,
see my <a href="http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/gbb">Galaxy Building Blocks</a>
page or the <a href="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1996/29/PR.html">press 
release from STScI</a>.</p>
 
<p> As always when we're onto something this new and interesting, we've
followed up on the discovery of these objects in several ways (including
ground-based data from <a href="kpno.html">Kitt Peak</a> and the
<a href="irtf.html">NASA Infrared Telescope Facility</a>. We've also
used HST to explore how common these might be in other directions -
how lucky were we to hit this grouping? We got several fields' worth
of parallel data in the same filters, obtained while some other program
was doing long spectroscopic exposures since we didn't care just what
pieces of sky were searched, and found a few such compact blue emission-line
galaxies (but never as many as in the 53W002 field). They do cluster,
and this offers promise of tracing how clustering has developed over cosmic
time. Later, we obtained near-IR observations using the NICMOS camera,
to look at the older stars (if there are any) and the emission lines
which started out being emitted as visible light. These spectral features
are quite sensitive to the chemical composition of the gas and the amount of
dust present, both of which can tell us about the history of these
protogalactic youngsters. The spectra are turning out to be somewhat painful to 
analyze, so those results will be some time in coming in.</p>
 
<p> Closer to home, Ray White III and I have used WFPC2 images to study the
role of dust in spiral galaxies. This has been a very contentious issue,
with well-supported arguments suggesting that spiral galaxies are either
fairly transparent or almost opaque. Which one is more correct makes a
huge difference for how we interpret the light we see from galaxies, and 
what we might be missing in the background as we study quasars in the
distant Universe. Following an 
<a href="http://www.astr.ua.edu/white/pairs/individual.html"> extensive 
ground-based survey</a>,
we were able to image three pairs of overlapping galaxies using HST.
Such overlapping galaxies offer a uniquely direct way to measure the
amount of absorption from dust, without some of the assumptions about galaxy 
internal structure required by the statistical analyses that have been prevalent 
in the field. Two of these pairs include a spiral in front of an
elliptical, and the third is a direct superposition of two spirals.
See also the initial
<a href="http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/research/aasdust.html">press release</a> 
accompanying the first
of these data. In later analysis, we included results from <a href="iso.html">
ISO</a> and the <a href="jcmt.html">JCMT</a> to measure total dust
masses in two different ways, with the comparison leading to interesting
limits on how much dust could still be hiding in the cold or small structures
that would elude easy detection. New results from the HST data themselves
include showing that the extinction curve, and hence the population of
interstellar grains, must be very similar in all these spirals to what we
see in the Milky Way, and the finding that there is a lower size limit to
the structures of dust that are important in absorbing background light
(which had me, for the first time in my professional life, actually
doing a fractal analysis).</p>


Still to come:
