<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><img src="/pictures/letters/J.gif" align="left" alt="J"
width="36" height="46" />onathan Wells' book <i><a href=
"http://www.iconsofevolution.com" target="_blank" title=
"Icons of Evolution promotional webpage">Icons of
Evolution: Science or Myth? Why Much of What We Teach About
Evolution Is Wrong</a></i> (henceforth <i>Icons</i>) makes
a travesty of the notion of honest scholarship. Purporting
to document that "students and the public are being
systematically misinformed about the evidence for
evolution," (p. XII) via common textbook topics such as
peppered moths, embryo similarities, and fossil hominids <a
href="#ftn2" name="Footnote_2">[2]</a>, <i>Icons</i> in
fact contains a bevy of its own errors. This is not
original -- creationists have been making mistakes about
evolution for years. Newly and more insidiously, however,
<i>Icons</i> contains numerous instances of unfair
distortions of scientific opinion, generated by the
pseudoscientific tactics of selective citation of
scientists and evidence, quote-mining, and "argumentative
sleight-of-hand," the last meaning Wells' tactic of padding
his topical discussions with incessant, biased
editorializing. Wells mixes these ingredients in with a few
accurate (but always incomplete) bits of science and
proceeds to string together, often in a logically arbitrary
fashion, a narrative that is carefully crafted to make the
semblance of an honest case for Wells' central defamatory
accusation: that mainstream biologists are "dogmatic
Darwinists that misrepresent the truth to keep themselves
in power" (pp. 242-243).</p>

<p>This essay will show that it is Wells' book <i>Icons</i>
that is shot through with misrepresentations.</p>

<p>The central pillar of Wells' case is this:</p>

<blockquote>"Some biologists are aware of difficulties with
a particular icon because it distorts the evidence in their
own field. When they read the scientific literature in
their specialty, they can see that the icon is misleading
or downright false. But they may feel that this is just an
isolated problem, especially when they are assured that
Darwin's theory is supported by overwhelming evidence from
other fields. If they believe in the fundamental
correctness of Darwinian evolution, they may set aside
their misgivings about the particular icon they know
something about." (<i>Icons</i>, pp. 7-8)</blockquote>

In other words, Wells argues that the specialists know
about the problems in their field of expertise, but that
everyone thinks that the evidence supporting evolution is
somewhere else. This is just plain false, as we shall see
-- the experts in each field have <i>explicitly stated</i>
that the evidence <i>in their field</i> supports
evolutionary theory, and further they have supported their
statements with evidentiary arguments. If Wells' contention
about the experts is false, then Wells' argument collapses.
Wells likes asking questions; it is now time for him to
answer some.<br />

<h2>Chapter 2: Miller-Urey experiment</h2>

<a name="Prebiotic-Oxygen"></a> 

<p><b>Prebiotic Oxygen.</b> A key question in
origin-of-life research is the oxidation state of the
prebiotic atmosphere (the current best guess is that the
origin of life occurred somewhere around 4.0-3.7 bya (billion
years ago)). Wells wants you to think that there is good
evidence for significant amounts free oxygen in the
prebiotic atmosphere (significant amounts of free oxygen
make the atmosphere oxidizing and make Miller-Urey-type
experiments fail). He spends several pages (14-19) on a
pseudo-discussion of the oxygen issue, citing sources from
the 1970's and writing that (p. 17) "the controversy has
never been resolved", that "Evidence from early rocks has
been inconclusive," and concluding that the current
geological consensus -- that oxygen was merely a trace gas
before approximately 2.5 bya and only began rising after
this point -- was due to "Dogma [taking] the place of
empirical evidence" (p. 18). None of this is true (see e.g.
<a href="#Copley2001">Copley, 2001</a>).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Certain minerals, such as uraninite, cannot form under
significant exposure to oxygen. Thick deposits of these
rocks are found in rocks older than 2.5 bya years ago,
indicating that essentially no oxygen (only trace amounts)
was present. On page 17 Wells notes that uraninite deposits
have been found in more recent rocks, but neglects to
mention to his readers that these only occur under
rapid-burial conditions, whereas ancient deposits of
uraninite occur in slow deposition conditions, for example
in sediments laid down by rivers, so that the minerals were
exposed to atmospheric gases for significant periods of
time before burial.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>'Red beds' are geologic features containing highly
oxidized iron (rust) indicative of high amounts of oxygen.
Wells (p. 17) notes that red beds are found before 2 bya,
but fails to mention that the temporal limit of red beds is
just a few hundred million years before 2 bya.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Wells doesn't even mention the evidence that banded iron
formations (incompletely oxidized iron indicative of
ultralow-oxygen conditions) are very common prior to 2.3
bya and very rare afterwards.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Wells also doesn't mention that early paleosols (fossil
soils) from about ~2.5 bya contain unoxidized cerium,
impossible in an oxygenic atmosphere (e.g., <a href=
"#MurakamiEtal2001">Murakami <i>et al.</i>, 2001</a>).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Finally, Wells doesn't mention to his readers that
pyrite, a mineral even more vulnerable to oxidation than
uraninite, is found unoxidized in pre-2.5 bya rocks, and
with significant evidence of long surface exposure (i.e.
grains weathered by water erosion; e.g. <a href=
"#RasmussenAndBuick1999">Rasmussen and Buick,
1999</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Why does Wells leave out the converging independent
lines of geological evidence pointing to an anoxic early
(pre ~2.5 bya) atmosphere?</p>

<br />
 <a name="Reducing-atm"></a> 

<p><b>Was the prebiotic atmosphere reducing? Are the
Miller-Urey experiments "irrelevant"?</b> The famous
Miller-Urey experiments used a strongly reducing atmosphere
to produce amino acids. It is important to realize that the
original experiment is famous not so much for the exact
mixture used, but for the unexpected discovery that such a
simple experiment could indeed produce crucial biological
compounds; this discovery instigated a huge amount of
related research that continues today.</p>

<p>Now, current geochemical opinion is that the prebiotic
atmosphere was not so strongly reducing as the original
Miller-Urey atmosphere, but opinion varies widely from
moderately reducing to neutral. Completely neutral
atmospheres would be bad for Miller-Urey-type experiment,
but even a weakly reducing atmosphere will produce lower
but significant amounts of amino acids. In the
approximately two brief pages of text where Wells actually
discusses the reducing atmosphere question (p. 20-22),
Wells cites some more 1970's sources and then asserts that
the irrelevance of the Miller-Urey experiment has become a
"near-consensus among geochemists" (p. 21).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This statement is misleading. What geochemists agree on
is that <i>if</i> the early earth's mantle was of the same
composition as the modern mantle <i>and</i> if only
terrestrial volcanic sources are considered as contributing
to the atmosphere, <i>and</i> if the temperature profile of
the early atmosphere was the same as modern earth (this is
relevant to rates of hydrogen escape) <i>then</i> there
will be much less hydrogen compared to Miller's first
atmosphere (20% total atm.). Even if this worst-case
scenario is accepted, hydrogen will not be completely
absent, in fact there is a long list of geochemists that
consider hydrogen to be present (although in lower amounts,
roughly 0.1-1% of the total atmosphere). At these levels of
H<sub>2</sub> there is still significant (although much
lower) amino acid production.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Also, many geochemists think that these conditions do
<i>not</i> represent the early earth, contrary to the
impression given by Wells. For example, on p. 20, Wells
mentions terrestrial volcanos emitting neutral gases
(H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, and only
trace H<sub>2</sub>), but he <i>fails</i> to mention that
mid-ocean ridge vents could have been significant sources
of reduced gases -- they are important sources of reduced
atmospheric gases even today, emitting about 1% methane (<a
href="#KastingAndBrown1998">Kasting and Brown, 1998</a>)
and producing reduced hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide (e.g.
<a href="#KelleyEtal2001">Kelley <i>et al.</i>, 2001</a>;
<a href="#Perkins2001">Perkins, 2001</a>; <a href=
"#VonDamm2001">Von Damm, 2001</a>) and potentially ammonia
prebiotically (<a href="#BrandesEtal1998">Brandes <i>et
al.</i>, 1998</a>; <a href="#Chyba1998">Chyba, 1998</a>).
Why does Wells exclude oceanic vents from
consideration?</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Another strange omission is that Wells completely fails
to mention the extraterrestrial evidence, which is the only
direct evidence we have of the kinds of chemical reactions
that might have occurred in the early solar system. For
example he neglects to mention the famous Murchison
meteorite, which contains mixtures of organic compounds
much like those produced in Miller-Urey style experiments,
and which constitutes direct evidence that just the right
kind of prebiotic chemistry was occurring at least
somewhere in the early solar system, and that some of those
products found their way to earth (see e.g. <a href=
"#EngelAndMacko2001">Engel and Macko, 2001</a> for a recent
review).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Wells asserts that since the 1970's, non-reducing
atmospheres have become the "near-consensus." The latest
article that Wells cites supporting this view, however, is
a 1995 nontechnical news article in <i>Science</i> (<a
href="#Cohen1995">Cohen, 1995</a>). Why doesn't he quote <a
href="#KralEtal1998">Kral <i>et al.</i> (1998)</a>, who
write,</p>

<blockquote>The standard theory for the origin of life
postulates that life arose from an abiotically produced
soup of organic material (e.g., Miller, 1953; Miller,
1992). The first organism would have therefore been a
heterotroph deriving energy from this existing pool of
nutrients. This theory for the origin of life is not
without competitors (for a review of theories for the
origins of life see Davis and McKay, 1996), but has
received considerable support from laboratory experiments
in which it has been demonstrated that biologically
relevant organic materials can be easily synthesized from
mildly reducing mixtures of gases (e.g., Chang <i>et
a</i>l., 1983). The discovery of organics in comets (e.g.,
Kissel and Kruger, 1987), on Titan (e.g., Sagan <i>et
al.</i>, 1984), elsewhere in the outer solar system (e.g.,
Encrenaz, 1986), as well as in the interstellar medium
(e.g., Irvine and Knacke, 1989) has further strengthened
the notion that organic material was abundant prior to the
origin of life.</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<p>None of this is meant to convey the impression that no
controversies exist (both <a href="#Cohen1995">Cohen
(1995)</a> and the <a href="#DavisAndMcKay1996">Davis and
McKay (1996)</a> article cited by the above-quoted <a href=
"#KralEtal1998">Kral <i>et al.</i> (1998)</a> are about the
various competing hypotheses about the origin of life). But
textbooks generally mention some of these hypotheses
(briefly of course, as there is only space for a page or
two on this topic in an introductory textbook), and
furthermore generally mention that the original atmosphere
was likely more weakly reducing than the original
Miller-Urey experiment hypothesized, but that many
variations with mildly reducing conditions still produce
satisfactory results. This is exactly what is written in
the most popular college biology textbook, <a href=
"#CampbellEtal1999">Campbell <i>et al.</i>'s (1999)</a>
<i>Biology</i>, for instance. In other words, the textbooks
basically summarize what the recent literature is saying.
The original Miller-Urey experiment, despite its
limitations, is also repeatedly cited in modern scientific
literature as a landmark experiment. So why does Wells have
a problem with the textbooks following the literature?
Wells wants textbooks to follow the experts, and it appears
that they are.</p>

<br />
 <a name="RNA-World"></a> 

<p><b>The RNA world.</b>Wells writes (p. 22) as if the RNA
world is an alternative to failed Miller-Urey-style
experimentation. He cites no source for this claim, because
the claim is pure obfuscation.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The RNA world hypothesis is complementary, not opposed,
to Miller-style prebiotic syntheses, as it is meant to
explain how genetic replication got going without DNA,
several steps down the road after prebiotic syntheses.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Wells gives the impression that there are only two
possible starts to life on earth, Urey-Miller style
syntheses and the RNA world. Wells misleadingly cites
several quotes that taken alone suggest that the RNA world
is impossible, and that there is no remaining scientific
explanations for life on earth. However, most authorities
agree that the RNA world was one <i>stage</i> of the origin
of life, rather than the very first stage, and that it was
proceeded by a pre-RNA world. Indeed, the very authors he
quotes to suggest that the RNA world is impossible go on to
explain the concept of a pre-RNA world and how an RNA world
would arise from that, but Wells omits all mention of this.
Wells doesn't bother to cite recent work on precursors to
the RNA world, see for example <a href=
"#CavalierSmith2001">Cavalier-Smith (2001)</a> for an
introduction and references to ideas on this such as the
'NA world' and 'lipid world' (for the latter, see e.g. <a
href="#SegreEtal2001">Segre <i>et al.</i>, 2001</a>).</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: Darwin's Tree of Life</h2>

<p>Wells mixes up several issues in this chapter. As we saw
in the previous chapter, he will give several topics each a
cursory and incomplete treatment, raising doubts about each
subject and connecting them together whether they are
logically connected or not.</p>

<a name="cambrian-explosion"></a> 

<p><b>The Cambrian Explosion</b>. Here Wells is running
down a path well-worn by his creationist and 'designist'
(IDist) colleagues. As a result there is already
significant literature available on the "animal phyla
appeared suddenly, and without precursors, and all equally
far apart from each other"-sort of contention.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>See for example Conway Morris (<a href=
"#Morris1998">Conway Morris, 1998</a>) for an authoritative
discussion, and <a href="#KnollAndCarroll1999">Knoll and
Carroll (1999)</a> which is freely available online. A
particularly interesting perspective is that of Keith B.
Miller, geologist, evolutionist and evangelical Christian,
who wrote an article (1999) in <em>Perspectives on Science
and Christian Faith</em> entitled "The Precambrian to
Cambrian Fossil Record and Transitional Forms," (<a href=
"http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/evolution/PSCF12-97Miller.html">
http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/evolution/PSCF12-97Miller.html</a>)
in which he wrote,</p>

<blockquote>There is much confusion in the popularized
literature about the evidence for macroevolutionary change
in the fossil record. Unfortunately, the discussion of
evolution within the Christian community has been greatly
influenced by inaccurate presentations of the fossil data
and of the methods of classification. Widely read critiques
of evolution, such as <i>Evolution: A Theory in Crisis</i>
by Denton, and <i>Darwin on Trial</i> by Johnson, contain
serious misrepresentations of the available fossil evidence
for macroevolutionary transitions and of the science of
evolutionary paleontology. [...] The implication of much of
the evangelical Christian commentary on macroevolution is
that the major taxonomic groups of living things remain
clearly distinct entities throughout their history, and
were as morphologically distinct from each other at their
first appearance as they are today. There is a clear
interest in showing the history of life as discontinuous,
and any suggestion of transition in the fossil record is
met with great skepticism. The purpose of this short
communication is to dispel some of these misconceptions
about the nature and interpretation of the fossil
record.</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>On page 38 of <i>Icons</i> Wells quotes page 30 of <a
href="#Morris1998">Simon Conway Morris' (1998)</a> book
<i>The Crucible of Creation</i> about the "sharp
demarcation" at the Cambrian explosion. But Conway Morris
writes on the very next page (32-3), "The term 'explosion'
should not be taken too literally, but in terms of
evolution it is still very dramatic. What it means is the
rapid diversification of animal life. 'Rapid' in this case
means a few millions of years, rather than the tens or even
hundreds of millions of years that are more typical when we
consider evolution in the fossil record." And of course one
of the central points of Conway Morris' entire book is that
the morphological disparity that emerges in the Cambrian,
often invoked by Wells &amp; co. via quotation of people
like Stephen J. Gould, is not quite as radical as the
IDists or even Gould would have it. There is a significant
problem in asserting that the animal phyla of the Cambrian
are as morphologically diverse as the fauna today -- in
large part this perception is due to the somewhat arbitrary
concepts of 'phylum' and 'body plan'. Conway Morris writes
(p. 170) that "the strangeness of the problematic Cambrian
animals is really a human artifact, a construct of our
imagination." On pages 185-195 he uses the fossils
<i>Wiwaxia</i> and <i>Halkieria</i> as <i>transitionals
between <b>phyla</b></i> (which by Wells' account shouldn't
exist) to connect three very 'disparate' major phyla --
Mollusca, Brachiopoda, and Annelida -- to each other.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>For someone who self-righteously passes judgment on
figures in textbooks, Wells' figures are atrocious. His
Figure 3.4, "Actual Fossil Records of the Major Living
Animal Phyla" purports to show when the various animal
phyla appear in the fossil record. Note that, again, Wells
cites no source in his notes to figure out where his
figures came from. However, examining a <a href=
"http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/phyla/metazoafr.html">similar
graphic</a> at the online University of California Museum
of Paleontology (<a href="#UCMP2000">UCMP, 2000</a>), we
see that Wells has left a number of phyla out, namely the
dozen or so that have either no fossil record or appear
very late relative to the Cambrian phyla. Notably all of
the missing phyla are soft-bodied, but if Wells admitted
that numerous phyla existed without any fossil record
whatsoever, he would severely weaken his argument on page
44 that any small, soft-bodied ancestors of the animal
phyla would have been fossilized if they existed. Wells'
figure also places Rotifera and Phoronida as having fossil
records in the Cambrian, which could be correct if the UCMP
page is out of date, but as Wells gives no references for
the figure it is impossible to check.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<br />
 <a name="molecular-phylogeny"></a> 

<p><b>Molecular Phylogeny.</b> Wells' second argument
against the Tree of Life deals with the 'molecular clock'
hypothesis -- namely that DNA or protein sequence
divergence is regular enough to date ancient splits between
lineages. This hypothesis is indeed being questioned by
scientists, as the influence of things like natural
selection may well alter the rate of sequence change (e.g.
cone snail venoms are a fantastic example of rapid sequence
divergence under selective pressure; see <a href=
"#EspirituEtal2001">Espiritu <i>et al.</i>, 2001</a>). And
if these changes occur often enough then getting accurate
clock dates, particularly for distant events, will be very
hard. This is an entirely different thing from determining
molecular phylogenies, however, which is what Wells is
actually trying to debunk. But unfortunately for Wells,
there is considerable evidence that these phylogenies are
reliable and in reasonably good accord with phylogenies
generated from other data. On the general subject of
accuracy in molecular phylogenies see <a href=
"#Theobald2002b">Theobald 2002b</a> and for recent work on
phyla evolution and metazoan molecular phylogenies, which
are quite certainly not in crisis, see recent articles in
places <i>Evolution and Development</i> (e.g., <a href=
"#CollinsAndValentine2001">Collins and Valentine, 2001</a>;
<a href="#PetersonAndEernisse2001">Peterson and Eernisse,
2001</a>).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Wells' Figure 3.6 (p. 47) is laughable. He represents
molecular phylogenies as comparing <i>four</i> (count 'em)
base pairs among <i>three</i> organisms. It looks like
this:</p>

<center>
<table border="1" summary="Icons, Figure 3-6, p. 47">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><b>DNA Sequence</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Organism 1</b></td>
<td>
<center>ATCG</center>
</td>
</tr>

<center>ATCT</center>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Organism 3</b></td>
<td>
<center>ATGT</center>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Why couldn't Wells at least get a real dataset, like any
article or even textbook would use? You have to compare at
least a few dozen base pairs before you can see the uncanny
way that organisms in the same genus match up far better
than organisms in different classes (for example). Here,
for example, is an <a href=
"http://members.cox.net/ardipithecus/evol/seq.html">alignment
of some cytochrome C amino acid sequences</a> from various
organisms (for discussion see <a href=
"http://members.cox.net/ardipithecus/evol/HovindLie.html">here</a>).
If Wells were interested in giving his readers a useful
graphic, he could have easily found something like this,
published in a 1992 article of the <i>Journal of Molecular
Evolution</i>:</p>

<li>
<p>Wells engages in a bit more quote-mining on page 51,
picking some molecular phylogenies studies that seem
ridiculous.</p>

<blockquote>Even when different molecules can be combined
to give a single tree, the result is often bizarre: A 1996
study using 88 protein sequences grouped rabbits with
primates instead of rodents; a 1998 analysis of 13 genes in
19 animal species placed sea urchins among the chordates;
and another 1998 study based on 12 proteins put cows closer
to whales than to horses.</blockquote>

<p>What Wells isn't telling you is that some of these
results are not in fact ridiculous.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Cows, for example, are artiodactyls which are indeed
thought to be closely related to whales, a suspicion which
has received striking confirmation from recent transitional
fossil discoveries (see the webpage of the discoverer
Thewissen, <a href=
"http://www.neoucom.edu/Depts/Anat/Pakicetidnew.html">http://www.neoucom.edu/Depts/Anat/Pakicetidnew.html</a>).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Sea urchins (phylum echinodermata) do indeed group
"among the chordates" but this is because they are a
<i>sister group</i> to chordates, not within chordates as
Wells implies. This taxonomy is a long accepted fact (see
e.g. the <a href=
"http://tolweb.org/tree?group=Animals&amp;contgroup=Eukaryotes&amp;dynnodeid=2406">
Metazoa</a> page of the Tree of Life, especially "D" for
"deuterostomes," the group which includes echinoderms and
chordates but excludes moulting organisms like arthropods).
The very paper that Wells cites recognizes these
distinctions explicitly.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The rabbits and rodents study, on the other hand, has
methodological flaws (although the two groups are indeed
more distantly related than the nonexpert might expect).

<p><b>The Root of the Tree of Life.</b> The 'Tree of Life'
is the idea, most famously advocated by Darwin, that all
known life is descended from a common ancestor and is
connected by a phylogenetic 'tree':</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The affinities of all the beings of the same class have
sometimes been represented by a great tree. I believe this
simile largely speaks the truth. The green and budding
twigs may represent existing species; and those produced
during each former year may represent the long succession
of extinct species. ... As buds give rise by growth to
fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop
on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I
believe it has been with the great Tree of Life, which
fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the
earth, and covers the surface with its ever branching and
beautiful ramifications." (Darwin, <i><a href=
"/faqs/origin/chapter4.html">Origin
of Species</a></i>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This idea has recently been implemented on the web in a
splendid fashion. See the <a href=
"http://tolweb.org/tree/phylogeny.html">Tree of Life Web
Project Home Page</a>.</p>

<p>In <i>Icons</i>, Wells has a ball with recent scientific
debates over whether or not lateral gene transfer mixed up
ancient genomes so much that deepest branches of the tree
are mixed up. Basically, some scientists have proposed that
the idea of a single "last common ancestor" should be
replaced with the idea of a "last common gene pool" that
the extant three domains of of life -- eukaryotes, archaea
and eubacteria, in one classification scheme -- gradually
emerged from. <a href="#Zimmer2001">Carl Zimmer (2001)</a>
describes this as the 'Mangrove of Life' idea. Wells (of
course) milks this for all it's worth, proclaiming the
downfall of common descent and the 'uprooting of the tree'
and whatnot, but he is distorting things.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This entire debate is, among scientists, about the very
oldest part of the tree, known as the '<a href=
"http://tolweb.org/tree?group=life">root</a>.' This is
where the lineages of the three fundamental '<a href=
"http://tolweb.org/tree?group=life">domains</a>' of life
come together. Apart from being the most remote event to
study timewise, the question of the rooting of the tree is
greatly complicated by lateral gene transfer, by differing
rates of evolution between genes and lineages, by the fact
that eukaryotes are the result of symbioses between archaea
and eubacteria, and by the fact that, by definition, the
Tree of Life has no outgroup, which creates technical
problems for placing the root. Scientists are attempting to
discern the most ancient events in the history of life
here, so complications are to be expected. One recent
article that is highly skeptical of much of the work that
Wells cites is <a href="#CavalierSmith2002">Cavalier-Smith
(2002)</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>What Wells does not point out is that this entire
controversy has precious little to do with eukaryote
phylogeny (which is coming along just fine, thank you, see
e.g. <a href="#BaldaufEtal2000">Baldauf <i>et al.</i>,
2000</a>), and nothing to do with metazoan phylogeny
(previously discussed), all of which will remain perfectly
traditional and tree-like no matter who wins the debate
over rooting the tree. To see what this means, go to the
Tree of Life webpage (<a href=
"http://tolweb.org">http://tolweb.org</a>), if you click on
the <a href="http://tolweb.org/tree?group=life">tree</a>,
you will find that the first page lists the three domains.
This is what the tree vs. mangrove debate is about. If you
click on <a href=
"http://tolweb.org/tree?group=Eukaryotes&amp;contgroup=Life&amp;dynnodeid=1">
eukaryotes</a>, you have entered the zone where, regardless
of the debate outcome, it appears that phylogenies will
remain tree-like -- in other words, essentially the entire
mapped tree. Wells' Figure 3.8 (p. 53) is very misleading
in this respect -- all macroscopic life, and a great deal
of microscopic life, fits into the tree branching off from
the 'molecular thicket'.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>How any of this is supposed to call evolution into
question is not at all clear -- Wells certainly has not
proposed a model that explains things better. And the fact
that textbooks aren't completely up to speed on current
scientific debates is not only not surprising, it's the way
things should be. This particular controversy is far from
resolved, and until it is, there is no real advantage of
putting it into textbooks. Even if the 'mangrove' model is
eventually accepted, it is rather difficult to see how this
makes "descent with modification from common
ancestors...not even a well-supported theory"
(<i>Icons</i>, p. 58), as the debate will have been
resolved by figuring out what the true lines of descent
are. If it turns out our remotest ancestors are a community
of gene-trading bacteria rather than a single one (and it
should be remembered that it is also possible that a
community of gene-trading bacteria could still be descended
from one bacteria), then this will be significant but
hardly something that overthrows the evolutionary view of
life. And as mentioned before, there are good reasons to
think that the traditional tree model will basically work
even down near the root. E.g., Cavalier-Smith (2002)
writes,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Recent worries that lateral transfer is so rampant
(Doolittle, 1999a, b) that we may never reconstruct
organismal trees are certainly false for eukaryotes and
probably incorrect for bacteria. I agree with Doolittle
(2000) that the widely accepted tree needs uprooting, not
because of lateral transfer, which is not seriously
confusing with respect to the root, but because quantum
evolution caused misrooting of the paralogue tree. We may
safely replant it as shown in Figs 1, 2 and 7. The idea
that genome composition in the cenancestor was so fluid
(Woese, 1998, 2000) that we cannot use cladistic arguments
to reconstruct it is more profoundly mistaken, being based
on the basic misinterpretations of the universal tree and
the evolutionary significance and timing of the differences
between eubacteria and neomura explained above. It has long
been clear (Cavalier-Smith, 1981, 1987a, b, 2001) that the
cenancestor was a normal eubacterium, not a progenote. As
Woese (1998, 2000) and Doolittle recognize, the most
readily transferred genes are not a random sample of the
whole, but obey certain rules (Rivera <i>et al</i>., 1998;
Jain <i>et al</i>., 1999; Martin, 1999)." (<a href=

<p><b>The Chinese paleontologist story.</b> On the last
page of this chapter of <i>Icons</i> (p. 58), Wells
recounts his story of an unnamed Chinese paleontologist who
visited the U.S. in 1999 and who Wells quotes as saying,
"In China we can criticize Darwin, but not the government;
in America, you can criticize the government, but not
Darwin." Given past experience with antievolutionist
anecdotes, it is to be strongly suspected that there is
more to this story than Wells is telling us.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This is particularly true if one reads the account of
Nigel Hughes (Department of Earth Sciences, University of
California, Riverside) of a small symposium held in June
1999 in China, where many well-preserved early metazoan
fossils have recently been discovered. Hughes says that the
meeting, the "International Symposium on the Origin of
Animal Body Plans and Their Fossil Records," was organized
by Professor Chen Jun-yuan -- although, as we will see
below, it appears that the Discovery Institute played a
significant role as well. Hughes was one of about 50
symposium participants.</p>

<p>Hughes reports on the meeting in the March/April 2000
issue of the journal <i><a href=
"http://www.blackwellscience.com/journals/evolution/">Evolution
and Development</a></i> (Vol. 2, Issue 2, pp. 63-66). Most
of the report is typical scientific meeting details, but
Hughes takes the last several paragraphs of his report to
discuss "the most curious aspect of the meeting":</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most curious aspect of the meeting, and the most
embarrassing for Western scientists (particularly those
from the United States), was the presence of individuals
supported by the Discovery Institute -- a Seattle-based
foundation that proclaims intelligent design as a
scientific explanation for biological diversity. The
involvement of the Institute came as a surprise to the more
conventional attendees, especially when it became obvious
that the Institute had played a key role in the
organization of the conference, unbeknownst to the
scientific community. Several talks were presented along
this theme, the main thesis of which seemed to be the old
Pallian arguments wrapped in a variety of molecular guises.
Michael Denton spoke on what he saw as a failure of
genetics to unveil a universal explanation for biological
form, Paul Nelson on maternal effect genes, and Jonathan
Wells on homeotic genes. It takes guts to expose yourself
in this manner to a generally incredulous audience, but it
also places special demands if science is your objective. I
was depressed to find that my rudimentary understanding of
molecular biology was sufficient to spot egregious errors,
candidly dispatched by Eric Davidson. Wells's claim that
aspects of <i>Hox</i> gene control, instead of providing
yet more evidence for homology and common ancestry,
actually suggest that all metazoan phyla arose
independently gives the flavor of what was offered. In
doing so he effectively denied any defensible meaning in
the words such as deuterosome or ecdysozoan, well
established higher taxa which have been erected on
characters other than those genes that influence segment
identity. A bold claim, but one he could not reasonably
defend as questioning revealed. Denton was dismayed that
biotic systems are more complicated than some geneticists
had expected in the 1960s, but the logical connection
between this and his belief in immutable natural designs
was left unexplained. And so it went on. The only thing new
here was the presence of these arguments at a meeting that
was ostensibly billed as being scientific.</p>

<p>How does one deal with such situations? Those speaking
were accompanied by a coterie of supporters, including a
"cosmic reporter" and one-by-one scientists attending
courteously answered their questions. Many of us, myself
included, reluctantly agree to be interviewed on tape. As
guests in China a major public blow-up was to be avoided,
but looking back I wish I had been more aggressive. We are
all used to arguing science, but we are not used to telling
people that we suspect their motives. Perhaps we have to
become so, because the extent, if any, to which Chinese
colleagues had been made aware of the controversial nature
of the Discovery Institute, and its political agenda within
the United States, remained unclear. What was clear is that
the Discovery Institute is actively encouraging Chinese
scientists, by means of funding, to promote a view of the
Chengjiang fauna to which they are sympathetic.</p>

<p>Several Chinese scientists gave presentations that
emphasized the sudden appearance of phyla, hinting at the
need for a new "top-down" mechanism of evolution -- music,
of course, to creationist ears. Although the Chengjiang
fauna does forcefully remind us that many body plans were
firmly established by early in the Cambrian, it does little
more than focus attention on the interesting things that
happened around the Precambrian/Cambrian boundary. The
"phylogenetic lawn" idea is hardly new (recall, for
example, Gould's <i>Wonderful Life</i>), and is clearly an
inaccurate view. Given the generous way in which scientists
at the meeting explained this and other matters to those
allied with the Discovery Institute it is disappointing to
find commentaries in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> (August
16, 1999) proclaiming that Chinese scientists have new
evidence that questions the very basis of evolution.
Predictably enough, the Discovery Institute turns out to be
uninterested in scientific rigor, and they will do whatever
it takes to promote their agenda, including taking
advantage of Chinese scholars. Creationism is not only a
specter that haunts rationality in the United States, but
it is also willing to employ a little cultural imperialism
if it furthers the cause.</p>

<p>(Hughes, 2000, "The rocky road to Mendel's play,"
<i>Evolution and Development</i>, <b>2</b>(2), 63-66)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>Wells discusses his story further in the footnotes
(<i>Icons</i>, p. 278), and implies that revealing the name
of the paleontologist would expose the scientist to
persecution from dogmatic Darwinists. But this is nonsense,
as it seems certain that the chinese paleontologist was at
the above symposium (quite possibly he was the organizer,
although I have no further evidence for this than the
Hughes piece above), and was clearly given a chance to give
his views. Antievolutionists of course often will
characterize mere disagreement as persecution, but that is
their problem.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Wells cites the supposed hounding of Colin Patterson as
support for Wells' persecution paranoia. This is a famous
creationist canard that has been dealt with many times
before (see e.g. the Colin Patterson FAQ [<a href=
"/faqs/patterson.html">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/patterson.html</a>]).
Fortunately Robert Hagen (University of Kansas, Department
of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology) has already dealt with
Wells' specific claims on Patterson and given permission to
have his analysis quoted here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>The "Darwinist Conspiracy": Wells vs. Reality</b></p>

<p>The strangest aspect of the book is the bizarre view of
mainstream science Wells presents: The idea that a secret
gang of "Darwinists" controls the teaching of evolution and
uses coercion and deceit to suppress all disagreement! Does
Wells present any evidence to support his claim of a
Darwinist conspiracy that mercilessly persecutes any
scientist who dares criticize the dogma?</p>

<p>No. But he does have an anecdote.</p>

<p>On p. 58, he quotes an unnamed Chinese paleontologist as
saying: "In China we can criticize Darwin, but not the
government; in America, you can criticize the government,
but not Darwin." Wells expands on this story in the
Research Notes:</p>

<blockquote>"The Chinese paleontologist story has been
making the rounds since I first told it to some colleagues
in 1999. Sadly, the principal reaction from dogmatic
American Darwinists has been to demand his name. I refuse
to give it to them, knowing what their colleagues have been
doing to critics since at least 1981, when British
paleontologist Colin Patterson, in a famous lecture at the
American Museum of Natural History in New York, openly
questioned whether there is any evidence for evolution.
Afterwards, dogmatic Darwinists hounded him relentlessly,
and Patterson never again voiced his skepticism in public.
I fear they would do the same to the Chinese paleontologist
in my story, an excellent scientist who deserves to be
protected from heresy hunters." (<i>Icons</i>, p.
278)</blockquote>

<p>This would be a compelling story, if it were true.
However, in Colin Patterson's own words, it was hardly
"dogmatic Darwinists" who hounded him:</p>

<blockquote>"Because creationists lack scientific research
or evidence to support such theories as a young earth
(10,000 years old), a world-wide flood (Noah's), and
separate ancestry for humans and apes, their common tactic
is to attack evolution by hunting out debate or dissent
among evolutionary biologists. When I published the first
edition of this book I was hardly aware of creationism but,
during the 1980s, like many other biologists I learned that
one should think carefully about candour in argument (in
publications, lectures, or correspondence) in case one was
furnishing creationist campaigners with ammunition in the
form of 'quotable quotes', often taken out of context." (C.
Patterson, <i>Evolution</i>, 2nd edition, p.
122)</blockquote>

<p>Patterson, who died in 1998, was not an individual who
could be cowed into silence by "dogmatists" of any sort.
With regard to the aspect of evolutionary biology that
Wells opposes-common descent-Patterson goes on to state his
view clearly:</p>

<blockquote>"I see the general historical theory, common
descent, as being as firmly established as just about
anything else in history. We have compelling reasons to
believe that Napoleon and the Roman empire existed,
although we don't know every detail of what went on in
Napoleon's life or in Rome and its colonies; it is much the
same with evolution. There is abundant documentary evidence
for Napoleon and the Roman empire; there is abundant
evidence for common descent in the hierarchy of homologies
at both the structural and morphological level, though
those documents may not be so easy to read." (Patterson, p.
123)</blockquote>

<p>The real reason that "experts on the evidence," such as
Patterson, don't reject Darwin's theory is simply that no
one -- including Wells -- has found a better theory:</p>

<blockquote>"...today's theory of evolution is unlikely to
be the whole truth. It is essential to keep in mind the
distinction between the general theory -- evolution has
occurred and species are related by descent -- and theories
of mechanism -- natural selection, neutralism, etc. Today's
theory, accepting that evolution has occurred and
explaining it by neo-Darwinism plus neutralism, is the best
that we have. It is a fruitful theory, a stimulus to
thought and research, and we should accept it until nature
prompts someone to think of one that is better or more
complete." (Patterson, p. 120)</blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 4: Homology in Vertebrate Limbs</h2>

<a name="def-homology"></a> 

<p><b>Is the definition of homology circular?</b> Wells
spends this entire chapter thoroughly confused about
homology, and does his best to confuse his readers as well.
About five minutes of research by yours truly turned up a
perfectly reasonable discussion of homology (Amundson,
2001) which nicely straightens things out: in a nutshell,
homology is <b><i>detailed similarity of organization that
is functionally unnecessary</i></b>, meaning the
<i>similarity</i> is unnecessary (the trait in question may
be, and usually is, functional).</p>

<p>This is not a drastically complicated idea, but Wells is
able to confuse himself because post-Darwin, homology is
usually defined as 'A feature in two or more taxa is
homologous when it is derived from the same (or a
corresponding) feature of their common ancestor.' Wells
accuses scientists of making the definition circular and
assuming common descent rather than providing evidence for
it, but of course if you doubt common descent then you have
to go back to the original definition, wherein you have
peculiar similarities that are functionally unnecessary
staring you in the face, begging you for an explanation. <a
href="#Amundsen2001">Amundsen (2001)</a> critiques the
circularity charge well:</p>

<blockquote>This criticism relies on a faulty view of what
scientific definition amounts to. A scientific definition
is not a semantic stipulation that creates an analytically
true statement (i.e. a statement the denial of which is
self-contradictory). Rather, a scientific definition
typically states a property that is considered to be the
most deeply explanatory of the phenomena that are central
to the term being defined. Lankester and Mayr consider
ancestry to explain patterns of homology, and stress that
fact by making it the definition. The historical definition
is not viciously circular as long as homologies can be
recognized and picked out by criteria other than common
ancestry. It is an empirical fact that homologies (as
picked out by the criteria below) are arranged among
organisms in a pattern that is explainable by common
ancestry, and independent evidence from various fields
supports common ancestry as a historical fact.</blockquote>

<p><b>Complexities of Homology; R. A. Raff comments.</b> On
pp. 72-78, <i>Icons</i> cites Rudolf Raff and other
scientists in an attempt to build a case that the use of
homology is somehow in crisis. The reality of most of these
cases is that scientists are simply discovering that
different kinds of homology are found at different
phylogenetic and organizational levels. Over the last few
years, the growing synthesis of evolutionary biology and
developmental biology has created a hot new subfield
referred to as "evo-devo." For an introduction to evo-devo,
see the article "<a href=
"http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/9/4424">The
evolution of evo-devo biology</a>," which heads up a an <a

special issue</a> on the topic that was published freely on
the web by the journal <i>Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences</i> (<a href=
"http://www.pnas.org">PNAS</a>).</p>

<p>The evo-devo specialist Rudolph Raff recently (Nov.-Dec.
2001) wrote an editorial in the journal <i>Evolution and
Development</i> entitled "The creationist abuse of
evo-devo," specifically on Wells and his book <i>Icons</i>.
Raff writes, in part,</p>

<blockquote><i>Icons of Evolution</i> presents the dark
view of evolutionary biologists held by Wells. He says that
we are involved in a conspiracy to consciously lie in what
we teach students and present in our writings. Claims of
deliberate scientific fraud and "Darwinian censorship"
reaches a crescendo as the book progresses. These are
strong accusations built on a shaky scaffolding of special
pleading and deceptive use of quotations. [...] Wells notes
correctly that there is not a necessary connection between
homologous genes and homologous structures, nor must
homologous structures arise from similar developmental
processes. [Wells and colleagues conclude that...]
"naturalistic mechanisms proposed to explain homology do
not fit the evidence." What logical gymnastics! If it is
unexplained, it must be unexplainable by evolutionary
biology. If it's be unexplainable by evolutionary biology,
it must require an intelligent designer. Unfortunately, as
the influence of the intelligent designer grows in this
train of thought, the relationships between phenomena and
explanations becomes increasingly arbitrary. Finally one
reaches a point where all biological features are "special
creations" and other explanations become unnecessary. (<a

<h2>Chapter 5: Haeckel's Embryos</h2>

<p>In the interests of forthrightness, one point must be
conceded straight out: Haeckel's embryo drawings have no
place in textbooks except as an example of how erroneous
ideas can get tacked onto important truths and perpetuated
even after being debunked (Haeckel's inaccurate drawings
have actually been 'exposed' multiple times since the
1800's, the <a href="#RichardsonEtal1997">Richardson <i>et
al.</i> (1997)</a> article that Wells cites being only the
most recent example). However, Wells as usual exaggerates
the implications of this for evolution.</p>

<ul>
<li><a name="raraff2"></a> 

<p><b>More from R. A. Raff.</b> In his critique of Wells,
the aforementioned Raff wrote,</p>

<blockquote>Richardson <i>et al.</i> (1997) showed that
Haeckel falsified the degree of external appearance of
these embryos to exaggerate similarity of phylotypic stage.
To Wells this means that "scientists have long known that
drawings showing similarities between fish and human
embryos were faked, yet continue to use them as evidence of
evolution." [...] Clearly Haeckel did a dishonest thing
with his drawing. Does this mean that the concept of a
phylotypic resemblance among vertebrate classes is a lie?
The answer is a resounding no, and the great indignation
raised by Wells is largely a pious smoke screen. The
crucial point is not the superficial external appearance of
embryos, but the sharing of major structural elements and
their topological relationships. (<a href="#Raff2001">Raff,
2001</a>)</blockquote>

<li><a name="richardson"></a> 

<p><b>Richardson on creationists and Haeckel.</b>
Richardson himself has been rather annoyed with the
creationist response to his article. Richardson wrote a
letter to <i>Science</i> in 1998. His response applies to
Wells equally well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our work has been used in a nationally televised debate
to attack evolutionary theory, and to suggest that
evolution cannot explain embryology (2). We strongly
disagree with this viewpoint. Data from embryology are
fully consistent with Darwinian evolution. Haeckel's famous
drawings are a Creationist cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre (3).
Early versions show young embryos looking virtually
identical in different vertebrate species. On a fundamental
level, Haeckel was correct: All vertebrates develop a
similar body plan (consisting of notochord, body segments,
pharyngeal pouches, and so forth). This shared
developmental program reflects shared evolutionary history.
It also fits with overwhelming recent evidence that
development in different animals is controlled by common
genetic mechanisms (4).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Haeckel was overzealous. When we compared
his drawings with real embryos, we found that he showed
many details incorrectly. He did not show significant
differences between species, even though his theories
allowed for embryonic variation. For example, we found
variations in embryonic size, external form, and segment
number which he did not show (1). This does not negate
Darwinian evolution. On the contrary, the mixture of
similarities and differences among vertebrate embryos
reflects evolutionary change in developmental mechanisms
inherited from a common ancestor (5). [...]</p>

<p>These conclusions are supported in part by comparisons
of developmental timing in different vertebrates (7). This
work indicates a strong correlation between embryonic
developmental sequences in humans and other eutherian
mammals, but weak correlation between humans and some
"lower" vertebrates. Haeckel's inaccuracies damage his
credibility, but they do not invalidate the mass of
published evidence for Darwinian evolution. Ironically, had
Haeckel drawn the embryos accurately, his first two valid
points in favor of evolution would have been better
demonstrated. (<a href="#Richardson1998">Richardson,
1998</a>)</p>

Why doesn't Wells quote this letter for his readers?<br />

<p><b>The vertebrate classes are <i>not</i> all equally
related.</b> Wells makes much of the embryological
differences between the different vertebrate classes,
implying that on evolutionary theory all of the classes are
equally related, but he leaves out the crucial fact <i>that
there is a clear and well-supported consensus about the
relationships between the classes</i>, based on numerous
lines of evidence, and that <i>the embryological
development of classes thought to be closely related on
independent grounds are in fact more similar than distantly
related classes</i>, which is the matching independent
nested hierarchy pattern that is predicted by common
descent (<a href="#Theobald2002a">Theobald, 2002a</a>).
Implying, as Wells does, that evolution predicts that all
of the vertebrate classes should be equally similar
developmentally is extremely misleading. Actually, the
similarities (taken as characters and put through a
cladistic analysis) should fall into the pattern shown in
Richardson <i>et al.</i>'s second-to-last figure, Figure 9,
which of course Wells doesn't show or mention. Richardson
<i>et al.</i>'s Figure 9 is shown here:</p>

In this figure, Mammalia are mammals; Aves are birds;
Crocodilia, Lipidosauria, and Testudinata are reptiles;
Amphibia are amphibians, and the top four groups are
various kinds of 'fish' (jawed, jawless, etc.).
Phylogenetically speaking, all tetrapods (amphibians,
reptiles, mammals and birds) are really just a sub-subgroup
of 'fish.' This figure actually dramatically
<i>under</i>represents the massive diversity of 'fish'
relative to tetrapods. For the full view, see the <a href=

<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>As you can see, mammals, birds, and reptiles are all
thought to be more closely related to each other than any
is to amphibians; and mammals, birds, reptiles, and
amphibians together (tetrapods) are all more closely
related to each other than any is to any of the various
groups of jawed and jawless fish. This particular nested
hierarchy can be derived from morphology and molecular
phylogeny, but an independent similarity hierarchy based on
similarities in the embryological development pathway also
will yield this pattern. See Theobald for some further

<p>Numerous other mistakes and distortions could be
mentioned, here is but one. Regarding Futuyma's use of the
Haeckel embryo drawings in the 3<sup>rd</sup> edition of
<i>Evolutionary Biology</i>, Wells writes (p. 109), "But it
was Futuyma who mindlessly recycled Haeckel's embryos in
several editions of his textbook, until a "creationist"
criticized him for it." However, an inspection of Futuyma's
1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> editions of
<i>Evolutionary Biology</i> reveals that <i>no</i> such
drawings were included in these editions. In the first
edition, Haeckel's biogenetic law and the problems with it
are discussed on page 153 in respectable fashion (this
corresponds with page 303 in the second edition) -- and in
fact the primary issue surrounding Haeckel in textbooks,
which has always been to debunk Haeckel's "ontogeny
recapitulates phylogeny" oversimplification, is in fact
admirably discussed in all three editions.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6: Archaeopteryx: The Missing Link</h2>

<p><i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> has long been something that
creationists have felt the need to deal with somehow, as it
is a clear fossil intermediate between two vertebrate
classes. However, creationist claims have been refuted so
often and so thoroughly regarding <i>Archaeopteryx</i> that
very little remains for Wells to do except raise a smoke
screen over whether or not <i>Archaeopteryx</i> was the
actual species through which the genes of the last common
ancestor of modern birds passed, or whether it was a
closely related side-branch. Either way, it is clear
evidence that a transition between the classes
occurred.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>It bears pointing out that while Wells makes a big deal
about the relative dating of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and the
various feathered dinosaurs, in fact the discrepancy is not
overwhelming. <i>Archaeopteryx</i> fossils are dated to be
about 150 million years old, and recent work has
established a date of 124 mya for the fossils in this area,
which puts them in the early Cretaceous (see the article by
Henry Gee at <a href=
"http://www.nature.com/nsu/990701/990701-1.html">http://www.nature.com/nsu/990701/990701-1.html</a>).
Wells claims on pp. 117-122 that cladistics has been used
to "rearrange the fossil evidence" and to provide
unwarranted support to the dinosaur-bird
connection. He is greatly troubled by the fact that no
feathered dinosaur fossils earlier than
<i>Archaeopteryx</i> have yet been found. Of course, until
very recently we had no feathered dinosaurs at all, which
tells you something about the spottiness of the record for
these small, hard-to-fossilize critters. The total number
of known <i>Archaeopteryx</i> specimens can be counted on
two hands, and they are found in a very restricted locale
in Bavaria (although I have recently heard that some new
specimens have been found in Spain). The Chinese sites are
similarly restricted as very special conditions are
necessary to fossilize feathers.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Wells tries to manufacture another Haeckel embryo
situation by describing the fraudulent fossil
<i>Archaeoraptor</i> that <i>National Geographic</i>
foolishly rushed into publication before scientists had a
chance to peer-review the fossil in established journals.
But even Wells has to admit that scientists caught the
fraud themselves, that the fossil was never published in
<i>Nature</i> or <i>Science</i>, and that the lifetime of
the fraud was a matter of weeks. A 'Piltdown bird,' to use
Wells' deliberately inflammatory language, this was not.
<i>National Geographic</i> was roundly criticized and will
undoubtedly exert more journalistic caution in the future.
Was <i>Archaeoraptor</i> ever in textbooks or even the
primary literature? No. Wells just brings it up to raise
the doubt level a bit higher.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>China has continued to produce magnificent fossils
documenting the dinosaur-bird connection. One wonders what
more it could possibly take to convince one that birds
evolved from dinosaurs than the recently discovered fossil
Dromeosaur, which skeletally speaking is entirely a small
bipedal nonflying dinosaur, but which is festooned with
feathers of several types? Excellent pictures of this
specimen can be found online at the American Museum of
Natural History website (<a href=

<h2>Chapter 7: Peppered Moths</h2>

<p>So many things are wrong with Wells' treatment of
peppered moths (<i>Biston betularia</i>) that it is hard to
list them all; but I will try. The authoritative reference
on this topic is M.E.N. Majerus' 1998 book <i>Industrial
Melanism: Evolution in Action</i>. This book includes two
long chapters on <i>Biston</i>. The first chapter, "The
peppered moth story," recounts the basic story of melanism
in <i>Biston</i>, and relates how this story was pieced
together by Kettlewell and others. The second chapter, "The
peppered moth story dissected," gives a thorough critical
review of the basic story, considering aspects and details
of the basic story in the light of research (by Majerus and
others) post-dating Kettlewell.</p>

<p>Crucially, however, Majerus clearly and explicitly
concludes that, in his view, Kettlewell got things
basically correct. At the beginning of his second peppered
moth chapter, Majerus writes,</p>

<blockquote>First, it is important to emphasize that, in my
view, the huge wealth of additional data obtained since
Kettlewell's initial predation papers (Kettlewell 1955a,
1956) does not undermine the basic qualitative deductions
from that work. Differential bird predation of the
<i>typica</i> and <i>carbonaria</i> forms, in habitats
affected by industrial pollution to different degrees, is
the primary influence of the evolution of melanism in the
peppered moth (<a href="#Majerus1998">Majerus, 1998</a>, p.
116).</blockquote>

<p>Majerus is so clear on this point that one suspects that
Majerus was anticipating that his critique would be
misinterpreted by non-peppered moth researchers. It seems
that there is a "too good to be true" quality about the
peppered moth story that leads people to interpret any hint
of criticism as a sign that the whole basic story is
crashing down. Scientists are by no means immune to this
tendency, and indeed they may be more prone to it given the
regularity with which popular ideas have been overturned
throughout the history of science. The press has an even
greater tendency towards snap judgements and
oversimplifications when it comes to scientific
discussions. Antievolutionists, on the other hand, have
always been stuck muttering "it's just microevolution
within a species." While this is true, the rapidity and
obvious adaptiveness of the change effected by natural
selection still seemed to give antievolutionists
discomfort. Therefore, it is understandable that when Wells
and his fans sniffed a scientific controversy over peppered
moths (in truth it was a fairly marginal kind of
controversy), they blew things way out of proportion.</p>

<ul>
<li><a name="mothrest"></a> 

<p>First, several of Wells' worst distortions must be dealt
with directly.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><b>The natural resting locations of peppered moths --
Majerus' data.</b> On page 148, Wells discusses the natural
resting places of peppered moths, under the heading
"Peppered moths don't rest on tree trunks." But they do, at
least sometimes. Here are the relevant datasets, which
Wells does not quote or cite for his readers:</p>

<li>
<p><b>Peppered moth photographs, staged and otherwise.</b>
Wells raises a fantastic stink about the fact that the
photographs of peppered moths in textbooks showing
light-colored typicals next to dark-colored melanics on
differing backgrounds, are staged. <i><b>But the point of
such photos is not to prove the truth of the 'classic'
story, it is to illustrate the relative crypsis of moth
morphs on different backgrounds.</b></i> Those who feel
that their innocent faith in insect photography has been
betrayed should consider the fact that most photos of
insects in textbooks are probably staged; insects are,
after all, small and difficult to photograph. The facts
that peppered moths are sparsely distributed and, well,
<i>camouflagued</i> also make them difficult to
photograph.</p>

<p>But as it turns out, the differences between staged and
unstaged photos are minimal. Readers who wish to see
unstaged photos of peppered moths are advised to look up
Majerus' <i>Industrial Melanism</i>. Majerus says that all
of the peppered moth photos taken by him in the book are
unstaged. Readers should consult the figures which are
listed below. It may be possible to get permission to
include the photos, but until then descriptions shall have
to suffice.</p>

<p>(For those with foggy memories of their texbooks,
English peppered moths come in three general phenotypic
categories: <i>typica</i>, the pale, original 'peppered'
form of the moth; <i>carbonaria</i>, the almost black
melanic form; and <i>insularia</i>, which includes a range
of intermediate-colored moths.)</p>

Six photos are shown (the first five are Majerus'), and the

<ul>
<li>
<p><b>(a)</b> "<i>Typica</i> and <i>carbonaria</i> forms of
the peppered moth on an [sic] horizontal birch branch."
[This situation, with two moths close enough together to
photograph at once, is very rare, basically only occurring
if two moths are meeting to mate.]</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>(b)</b> "A pair of peppered moths on a twig at dawn.
The <i>carbonaria</i> male is much less conspicuous than
the <i>typica</i> female." [The <i>carbonaria</i> moth is
quite blurry.]</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>(c)</b> "A <i>carbonaria</i> peppered moth in shadow
under a horizontal branch, showing how this positioning may
reduce the likelihood of detection." [The moth is being
viewed head-on and is indeed difficult to see.]</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>(d)</b> "Typical form of the peppered moth at rest
during the day in hazel foliage." [Head-on view, the moth
is hanging underneath a thick twig.]</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>(e)</b> "An intermediate, <i>insularia</i> form, of
the peppered moth." [A 'classic' view, the moth is
well-matched to its background, which is apparently tree
bark.]</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>(f)</b> "The non-melanic form of the peppered moth
from North America, <i>Biston betularia cognataria</i>
(courtesy of Professor Bruce Grant)." [A 'classic' view,
the moth is well-matched to its background, which is a
lichen-covered surface.]</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It should be noted that Majerus is concerned to show his
readers aspects of the peppered moth story that they do not
get in textbooks; thus the focus on <i>insularia</i> forms
and on moths in branches (Majerus is a proponent of the
view that peppered moths most commonly -- but <i>not</i>
entirely or even almost entirely -- rest on the underside
of branches and thick twigs in the forest canopy). Even so,
there are several photos that show peppered moths, on tree
trunks, on more-or-less matching backgrounds. And guess
what? <b><i>These photos look no different than 'staged'
photos of moths on tree-trunks.</i></b> The most 'staged'
aspect about a 'staged' photo is that two differing moth
forms are shown side-by-side, but Majerus' first two photos
from Plate 3 indicate that even this is not impossible. So
the entire photo issue is a mountain made of a
molehill.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that several (four) of these
unstaged photos have some (minor but noticeable) degree of
blurring (e.g., part of the moth will be out of focus).
Insects in the wild do annoying things like move and fly
away, and are often encountered in poor-light conditions,
resulting in less-than-perfect photos. As scientific
documentation of observations this is unimportant, but
flawed photographs are exactly the kind of thing that are
avoided in textbooks, and this is precisely why staging
insect photos is a common practice for textbooks (as well
as things like nature shows).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<br />
 

<p><b>Summary of Wells' treatment of moth resting
places.</b> To review, Wells' primary objection to the
peppered moth story was this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most introductory textbooks now illustrate this
classical story of natural selection with photographs of
the two varieties of peppered moth resting on light- and
dark-colored tree trunks. (Figure 7-1) What the textbooks
don't explain, however, is that biologists have known since
the 1980's that the classical story has some serious flaws.
The most serious is that peppered moths in the wild don't
even rest on tree trunks. The textbook photographs, it
turns out, have been staged. (<i>Icons</i>, p. 138)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Figure 7-1 is on <i>Icons</i>, p. 139; these are
<i>drawings</i> by <i>Icons</i> illustrator Jody F.
Sjogren; the source photo, if there is one, is not cited.
Confusingly, the caption for the figure is not on page 139
but overleaf on page 140. These are not encouraging signs
in a book purporting to critique textbooks.]</p>

<p>The discussion thus far has shown that Wells' "most
serious objection" to the peppered moth story is completely
baseless: first, peppered moths do in fact rest on tree
trunks (a significant portion of the time although not the
majority of the time, according to Majerus' data). Second,
textbook photos are used to show relative crypsis of moth
morphs, <i>not</i> to prove that peppered moths always rest
in one section of the trees. And third, Majerus himself has
taken unstaged photos of peppered moths on matching tree
trunk backgrounds, and these are not significantly
different than staged photos; this eviscerates whatever
vestige of a point Wells thinks that he has.</p>

<a name="mothbranch"></a> 

<ul>
<li>
<p><b>What are the implications if moths rest most often
underneath branches?</b> Leaving aside Wells' frantic
attempt to create a problem where none exists, the
relevance of moth resting locations for the 'classic story'
(natural selection by bird predation) deserves some
consideration. Majerus' considered opinion is that peppered
moths rest more commonly underneath branches than was
previously appreciated, and that if this is true then some
quantitative estimates of selection coefficients may need
to be adjusted. However, he is quite clear that the basic
qualitative conclusions of Kettlewell (that differential
bird predation of moth morphs on changing backgrounds is
the selective force) do not need to be changed. As Majerus
notes, crypsis is still important for moths in tree
branches. He even comments directly on this with two of his
photos (Plate 3, photos <b>(b)</b> and <b>(c)</b>). And of
course, birds are known to (a) fly and (b) feed in forest
canopies, so it is very difficult to see why resting on
trunks vs. branches would change bird predation in any
radical way.</p>

<p><b>The scientific literature.</b> Having dealt with
Wells' "most serious objection," let us turn to Wells' use
of the scientific literature. The primary problem is that
Wells gives inordinate weight to a few scattered review
papers, by biologists who are not major peppered moth
researchers <a href="#ftn3" name="Footnote_3">[3]</a>, that
question the standard view (that bird predation on
different colored moths on differently polluted backgrounds
caused the darkening of moth populations as pollution
increased, and that as pollution decreased this process
worked in the opposite direction). Their criticisms have
been answered by peppered moth researchers (<a href=
"#Grant1999">Grant, 1999</a>; <a href="#Cook2000">Cook,
2000</a>; <a href="#GrantAndClarke2000">Grant and Clarke,
2000</a>; <a href="#Majerus2000">Majerus, 2000</a>). And,
as pointed out in the introduction, since Wells bases his
argument on the idea that the experts are disowning the
'icons' in their respective fields, Wells is falsified if
those experts contradict Wells.</p>

<p><b>Bruce Grant's review of Wells.</b> American peppered
moth researcher Bruce Grant has written many papers on
<i>Biston</i>, and has documented the parallel rise and
fall in melanic forms of the North American subspecies of
the peppered moth. See Grant's webpage [<a href=
"http://www.wm.edu/biology/Grant.html">http://www.wm.edu/biology/Grant.html</a>]
for listed articles. Dr. Grant has kindly given permission
to have his comments on the peppered moth chapter of
<i>Icons</i> quoted in this article.</p>

<p>To put them in context, the material quoted below is a
copy of the correspondence between Grant and a professional
colleague who had requested Grant's views on Wells'
chapter, originally written February 7, 2001.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Subject:</b> Wells' Chapter on Peppered Moths</p>

<p>Wells' Chapter 7 is pretty similar to his earlier ms.
"Second thoughts about peppered moths" that he posted on
the web, and published in abridged form in <i>The
Scientist</i>. I sent you my comments about that version
about two weeks ago. My general reaction to this latest
version is about the same. He distorts the picture, but
unfortunately he is probably pretty convincing to people
who really don't know the primary literature in this field.
He uses two tactics. One is the selective omission of
relevant work. The other is to scramble together separate
points so doubts about one carry over to the other.
Basically, he is dishonest.</p>

<p>He immediately launches the claim "that peppered moths
in the wild don't even rest on tree trunks" (p. 138). This
is just plain wrong! Of course they rest on tree trunks,
but it's not their exclusive resting site. He quotes Cyril
Clarke's lack of success in finding the moths in natural
settings, but he omits mentioning Majerus' data which
reports just where on trees (exposed trunks, unexposed
trunks, trunk/branch joints, branches) Majerus has found
moths over his 34 years of looking for them. Of the 47
moths he located away from moth traps, 12 were on trunks
(that's &gt;25%). Of the 203 he found in the vicinities of
traps, 70 were on trunks (that's 34%). Based on his
observations, Majerus argued that the most common resting
site appears to be at the trunk/branch juncture. What is
clear from his data is that they sit all over the trees,
INCLUDING the trunks. So what? Kettlewell's complementary
experiments in polluted and unpolluted woods compared the
relative success of different colored moths on the same
parts of trees in different areas, not different parts of
trees in the same area. It is true that the photos showing
the moths on trunks are posed (just like practically all
wildlife pictures of insects are) but they are not fakes.
No one who reads Kettlewell's paper in which the original
photos appeared would get the impression from the text that
these were anything but posed pictures. He was attempting
to compare the differences in conspicuousness of the pale
and dark moths on different backgrounds. Nobody thought he
encountered those moths like that in the wild. At their
normal densities, you'd be hard pressed ever to find two
together unless they were copulating. I have always made a
point of stating in photo captions that the moths are
posed, and I think textbook writers have been careless
about this. But they are not frauds.</p>

<p>On the subject of lichens, no one has questioned their
importance more than I have. But what does Wells do with
this? He quotes me, but he doesn't include what else I said
has happened on the Wirral (p. 147) with respect to the
tremendous expansion of birch stands since the enactment of
the smokeless zones. Kettlewell, too, argued that peppered
moths are well concealed on birch bark (even without
lichens). Wells continues (p. 148) to quote my reservations
about lichens in Michigan, but, again, he omits any
reference to the data I presented in that paper showing the
decline, not only in SO2, but in atmospheric particles
(soot) which has been established as a factor altering
reflectance from the surface of tree bark. So, while I have
questioned the importance of lichens, I have not taken this
as evidence that crypsis is unimportant. Wells omits this
entirely.</p>

<p>Wells continues to bring up the same old arguments about
mysterious other factors (yet to be identified) that
account for the persistence of typicals in polluted
regions, and the presence of melanics in unpolluted
locales. He cites papers written back in the 70s about
these puzzles. He omits discussing in any sophisticated way
the role of migration other than to say "Theoretical models
could account for the discrepancies only by invoking
migration...." (p.146), as if in desperation we are forced
to grasp at straws. Of course migration is important.
Majerus actually reviews this point fairly well by
comparing the smoothness of clines in melanism between
species that are highly mobile (as is <i>Biston</i>), and
species that are relatively sedentary. Instead of showing
his meaningless map of the UK (Fig. 7-2) to illustrate what
he regards as anomalies in the distribution of melanism and
lichens, why doesn't he show the before and after
comparison from the national surveys by Kettlewell in 1956,
and the survey by Grant <i>et al</i>. in 1996. (If you'd
like, I can send you a jpg file of the maps I mean.)</p>

<p>Wells also inappropriately uses thermal melanism in
ladybirds to suggest, that while no one has shown this in
peppered moths (p. 152), industrial melanism can have other
causes besides predation. It's not just that there is no
evidence for thermal melanism in peppered moths, there is
evidence AGAINST thermal melanism based on the geographic
incidence of melanism in the UK, the USA, and Europe. There
are no latitudinal clines, and no altitudinal clines as one
might expect with thermal melanism. Wells knows this, if he
actually read my papers. (He cites them, so I should assume
he read them.) He also raises the question of larval
tolerance to pollutants. There is no evidence for this,
either. I have a paper out on this point, but in fairness
to Wells, it came out just this past year.</p>

<p>Wells clouds discussions with irrelevancies. For
examples he brings up Heslop Harrison (p. 141 and again on
p. 151) and the question of phenotypic induction. Wells
makes it sound as if most biologists discount induction
based on their belief in natural selection (as if it were a
popular religious question). The evidence for the Mendelian
inheritance of melanism in peppered moths has nothing to do
with evolutionary theory; it is based on old fashioned
crosses involving over 12 thousand progeny from 83 broods.
The Mendelian basis for this character in this species is
as well established as is any character in any species.
Wells doesn't mention this, yet he cites my review paper
where I do bring this up in my criticism of Sargent <i>et
al</i>. Induction has nothing to do with industrial
melanism, and Wells knows it. Again, selective omissions on
the part of Wells.</p>

<p>On page 151 Wells claims Kettlewell's evidence has been
impeached. This is nonsense. It has not. But I have argued,
that even if it were entirely thrown out, the evidence for
natural selection comes from the changes in the percentages
of pale and melanic moths. It is this record of change in
allele frequency over time that is unimpeachable. It is a
massive record by any standard. (I can send a jpg file with
graphs, if you'd like.) I have pointed out, and he quotes
me, that no force known to science can account for these
changes except for natural selection. Yet, he scrambles the
ingredients here. He claims (top of p. 153) "...it is clear
that the compelling evidence for natural selection that
biologists once thought they had in peppered moths no
longer exists." Of course the evidence for natural
selection exists! That evidence is overwhelming. Wells, by
attempting to discredit Ketttlewell's experiments about
predation (and clearly there are things wrong with
Kettlewell's experiments) doesn't stop at saying we can't
be altogether sure about bird predation because of problems
with Kettlewell's experiments. No. He says, instead, that
the evidence for natural selection no longer exists. This
is just plain wrong. He cannot support this sweeping
statement, but he spins it into his conclusion by building
a case against Kettlewell. This is what I mean about his
tactic of scrambling arguments. He wields non sequiturs
relentlessly.</p>

<p><b>M.E.N. Majerus' review of Wells.</b> Majerus, who as
we have noted wrote the (most recent) book on peppered
moths and industrial melanism (<a href=
"#Majerus1998">Majerus, 1998</a>), wrote a detailed
critique of Wells' earlier treatment of peppered moths in
1999. Here is Majerus' opinion of Wells' treatment of
peppered moths (in part; see the links below for the entire
correspondence online):</p>

<blockquote>[...] 

<p>Evidence of selective predation in the peppered moth is
not lacking. It is just not provided in the quick text book
descriptions of the peppered moth. How can it be. I have
read some 500 papers on melanism in the Lepidoptera. In
total, these papers probably amount to about 8000 pages,
and the story is condensed into a few paragraphs in most
textbooks for schools. Even in my own book, I could only
give a review of the case covering about 60 pages including
illustrations.</p>

<p>The older hypothesis that melanism was induced by
pollutants was discredited because Heslop [Harrison's]
experiments lacked appropriate controls, and his results
could not be replicated, despite several attempts.
Furthermore, the levels of mutagenesis that he recorded are
several times higher than those produced by doses of
radiation that induce complete sterility in fruit flies
(see E.B. Ford (1964) Ecological Genetics for full critical
review).</p>

<p>Finally, I agree with Dr Wells that photographs of two
peppered moths staged on backgrounds for effect should say
they have been done purely for illustrative purposes. I
have many times, in undergraduate lectures, pointed out
that photographs of the type that appear in so many text
books are faked. However, I would point out that none of
the photographs of live peppered moths taken by myself,
which appear in the book were staged. All show peppered
moths where they were found in the wild.</p>

<p>End-note: It is difficult to have an informed discussion
of a complicated ecological system with those who have
little or no experience of the system. My advice to anyone
who wishes to obtain a fully objective view of this case is
to a) read the primary papers that I based my review upon,
and any other relevant papers, and b) gain some experience
of this moth and its habits in the wild. Of all the people
I know, including both amateur and professional
entomologists who have experience of this moth, I know of
none who doubts that differential bird predation is of
primary importance in the spread and decline of melanism in
the peppered moth.</p>

<p>I hope that this is some use to you, Donald, and that it
encourages more people to look at the case of the peppered
moth with an open mind. If it can help interest a few more
people in moths and butterflies, that is all to the
good.</p>

<p>Best wishes, and Happy Easter.</p>

<p>The above was posted to the Calvin listserv in Donald
Frack's detailed investigation of Wells' claims (e.g. <a
href=
"http://www.calvin.edu/archive/evolution/199904/0103.html">http://www.calvin.edu/archive/evolution/199904/0103.html</a>).
In his response, Wells freaks out and calls Majerus (who
had previously been Wells' main source for Wells' "peppered
myth" claims) a fraud:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>BUT EVERYONE, INCLUDING MAJERUS, HAS KNOWN SINCE THE
1980'S THAT PEPPERED MOTHS DO NOT REST ON TREE TRUNKS IN
THE WILD. This means that every time those staged
photographs have been re-published since the 1980's
constitutes a case of deliberate scientific fraud. Michael
Majerus is being dishonest, and textbook-writers are lying
to biology students. The behavior of these people is
downright scandalous.</p>

<p>I know what I'm talking about. I spent much of last
summer reading the primary literature (email me if you want
the references). Frankly, I was shocked by what I found --
not only that the evidence for the moths' true
resting-places has been known since the 1980's, but also
that people like Majerus and Miller continue to deceive the
public.</p>

<p>Fraud is fraud. It's time to tell it like it is. (caps
original, <a href=

</blockquote>

<p>Frack says of this,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note the complete irony of the capitalized sentence.
Majerus is the foremost proponent (in the literature I've
seen) of the idea that the moths most commonly rest higher
in the trees. His data are the only ones I have seen cited
as evidence of [what] happens "in the wild." Majerus is
attacked as "dishonest" and "text-book writers are lying to
biology students", their behavior is "scandalous." [...] If
Wells is right, he hasn't demonstrated it here. He attacks
both Michael Majerus and Bruce Grant. If Grant's frequent
co-authors, such as Cyril Clarke, are added to the ridicule
list (and I don't know why they wouldn't be), then Wells is
well on his way to rejecting all the well-known researchers
on this subject. An awesome, and, at face value, an
incredibly arrogant, claim.</p>

<p><b>Of moths and maps.</b> So, the experts disagree with
Wells and furthermore identify just the kinds of deceptive
tactics that I have been talking about. A further instance
is Wells' Figure 7-2 (p. 145), a map of England with four
locations marked with letters representing "Discrepancies
in peppered moth distribution." This map deserves
enshrinement as exhibit A in geographer <a href=
"#Monmonier1996">Mark Monmonier's (1996)</a> book <i>How to
Lie with Maps</i>. This is basically what Wells' map looks
like:</p>

However, if one inspects real maps by real moth
researchers, one finds that the geographic pattern is
actually a good match with expectations. Here are the maps

melanic phenotypes in peppered moth populations in Britain
based on Kettlewell's 1956 survey (left map) and that
conducted 40-years later (1996) by my colleagues and me
(right map). The black segments of the pie charts indicate
the percentage of melanics at the various locations.
Clearly melanism has declined everywhere it was once
common." (Grant, personal communication, February 11,

<h2>Chapter 8: Darwin's Finches</h2>

<p>"Darwin's Finches" are a group of closely-related bird
species located on the Gal&aacute;pagos islands. The
finches have been studied ever since Darwin made the first
collection of these species, but the best-known recent work
has been conducted by the husband-and-wife team of Peter
and Rosemary Grant and their collegues and students. See
Peter Grant's 1986 book <i><a href=
"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691048665">Ecology
and Evolution of Darwin's Finches</a></i> and subsequent
articles by the Grants, and especially Jonathan Weiner's
1994 book <i><a href="#Weiner1994">The Beak of the Finch: A
Story of Evolution in Our Time</a></i> for a popular
introduction to their work.
See also the March-April 2002 issue of <i>American 
Scientist</i>, "Adaptive Radiation of Darwin's Finches," by Peter and 
Rosemary Grant. The abstract and some graphics are online here:<br />

</p>

<p><b>Finches not relevant to Darwin?</b> Wells claims that
the finches were not relevant to Darwin's development of
evolutionary theory, but Wells is playing fast and loose
here. Wells writes (p. 160) that the finches "are not
discussed in [Darwin's] diary of the <i>Beagle</i> voyage
except for one passing reference." Wells (p. 162) does
include a quote from the two pages that Darwin spent on the
finches in <i>The Voyage of the Beagle</i> (Wells, like
Weiner, calls it <i>Journal of Researches</i>), but Wells
neglects the well-known fact that this quote constitutes
the <i>first publicly published hint</i> of evolutionary
theory from Darwin (<a href="#Weiner1994">Weiner,
1994</a>). Wells also leaves out mention of the prominent
figure that Darwin put in <i>Voyage of the Beagle</i>,
showing the differently-adapted beaks of the finches. You
can read the quote yourself in the online edition of
<i>Voyage of the Beagle</i> at <a href=
"http://www.literature.org/authors/darwin-charles/">http://www.literature.org/authors/darwin-charles/</a>.
The various legends that have grown up around Darwin and
the finches -- similar to Galileo and the Leaning Tower of
Piza -- are well addressed in Jonathan Weiner's <i>The Beak
of the Finch</i> (p.p. 35-36), minus the patronizing
editorializing of Wells. Darwin made the first scientific
collection of the finches, so the label "Darwin's Finches"
is entirely appropriate.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><b>The origin of the finches.</b> Wells' figure 8-1,
showing the 14 species of Darwin's finches in a radial
pattern, is as usual not very helpful to a reader
interested in the truth. Why does Wells not show the
finches in their traditional classification into four
genera (or five or six; see <a href="#SatoEtal2001">Sato
<i>et al.</i>, 2001</a>)?</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Why, for that matter, does Wells never mention the
scientific names of the finches or their division into
multiple genera? Perhaps Wells avoids doing this because it
would undermine his whole argument that the Grants'
conclusion that natural selection (and a few other
well-known factors, e.g. isolation) is responsible for the
speciation of the finches is making "more of their work
than the evidence warrants." (p. 174) Wells of course makes
no attempt to propose a better explanation, or even give
any reason why their conclusion is wrong. Wells instead
focuses on the back-of-the-envelope calculation of Peter
Grant in a 1991 that under directional selection a
speciation event could occur in 200 years, even though
Peter Grant acknowledges in that very publication that he
has observed oscillating selection.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Wells pretends that the only evidence for natural
selection being responsible for speciation is the Grants'
direct observations. But this is patently false -- Wells
brushes off the extensive character displacement studies by
multiple researchers as "indirect" (p. 164); he notes that
non-oscillating climate or a long-term trend change in the
future might make selection directional, but Wells fails to
tell his readers that we have extensive evidence of just
this occurring in the past, e.g. ice ages on the scale of
hundreds of thousands of years; and Wells fails to note
that the oscillating prospects of hybrid finches that the
Grants have observed is a result of <i>competition</i> for
resources among individuals of species that have divided up
the available resources by specializing on food sources
(this is character displacement).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Wells spends most of the chapter on the Grants'
selection and hybridization studies, but he gives barely a
hint of The Main Point of the Darwin's Finches, namely that
overwhelming evidence indicates that these several genera
evolved from a single ancestral species, and that they did
so in an adaptive manner.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Wells never stops to think of what might happen if a
<i>single</i> finch population were to arrive on the
originally finch-free Gal&aacute;pagos islands. Currently,
the various finch species have evolved to specialize on
different resources (different sizes of seeds, etc.). Thus,
the divergence of one species into two is impeded by
prexisting finch species occupying other niches. But this
would not be the case for the first finch population to
arrive at the island. Expansion into new niches would be
favored because those niches would be unoccupied.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Parenthetically, Wells completely botches his
description of El Ni&ntilde;o on p. 168. Wells describes El
Ni&ntilde;o as "a disturbance in the winter weather
patterns caused by unusually warm air over the Pacific
Ocean." ... which is incorrect, as an El Ni&ntilde;o event
is actually a <i>change in the sea-surface temperature
gradient</i> <i>across</i> the Pacific. Normally winds push
water westwards along the equatorial Pacific, resulting in
the upwelling of cool nutrient-rich water in the eastern
Pacific. When the winds weaken, the warm water "sloshes"
(speaking very colloquially) eastward, resulting in a
cooler west Pacific and a warmer east Pacific, resulting in
reduced upwelling (and poorer fishing) in the eastern
Pacific and heavy rains in the Gal&aacute;pagos and in
southern California (see <a href="#NOAA2001">NOAA, 2001</a>
for a more complete description).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>An excellent treatment of the finch example is given by
<a href="#Weiner1994">Weiner's (1994)</a> <i>The Beak of
the Finch</i>. See also:</p>

<h2>Chapter 9: Four-Winged Fruit Flies</h2>

<p>Wells must have been hard up for icons at this point,
considering that in the text he cites (p. 185) exactly one
textbook that uses the example, and mysteriously leaves
this "Icon" out of his textbook evaluation (p. 249). Wells
leaves fossil horses and fossil hominids out of this
evaluation, also, although for different reasons as they
are ubiquitously cited in textbooks.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Wells' brief (pp. 181-182, see also 245-246) discussion
of "biochemical mutations" (all mutations are biochemical,
actually) is another in a long line of IDist attempts to
minimize the importance of things like antibiotic
resistance (and the corresponding importance that such
examples confer to evolutionary biology). Reviews in the
mainstream literature, however (e.g. <a href=
"#Walsh2000">Walsh, 2000</a>) are never so flippant. <a
href="#Walsh2000">Walsh (2000)</a> notes that bacteria have
'learned' how to pump out antibiotic molecules, destroy
them, and evade them, and discusses several options to new
develop new antibiotics, methods of circumventing bacterial
resistance, and strategies for extending antibiotic
lifespan through a more rational use of drugs. A good
discussion of this issue is also found in Weiner's (1994)
chapter "The Resistance Movement."</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Wells tries (on p. 189) to disqualify all of the above
evidence for beneficial mutations by demanding what he
calls "<i>morphological</i> mutations." Wells brushes off
all of the examples of rapid morphological evolution in the
literature (e.g. cichlid mouthpart specialization, Hawaiian
<i>Drosophila</i>, and so forth), as well as the utterly
ubiquitous evidence that changes in genes cause changes in
morphology, with a single brazen hand-wave (p. 190) about
how the connection between genetic differences and
morphological differences is "assumed". Wells claims that
there is support for his notions among past biologists and
in non-American biologists, but all he can do in the text
is cite a postmodern-sounding argument from a historian. In
the notes he cites a smattering of sources, e.g. Brian
Goodwin (no supporter of extra-genetic inheritance as far
as I've heard) and a 1990 article raising the possibility
of somatic inheritance, but Wells doesn't even try to build
a case; presumably he is just trying to up the doubt meter
a bit. Wells also does no serious search for the evidence
he says he requires, namely genetic difference leading to
beneficial morphological difference; I, however, was able to find
an example in 30 seconds on PubMed, dealing with the
mapping of genetic loci that correlate with the
morphological differences between the flowers of two
closely-related species of monkeyflower (<i>Mimulus</i>) --
one species is pollinated by bumblebees, the other by
hummingbirds, and the 12 specific morphological differences
that allow this are each traced to one or a few loci on the
chromosomes (<a href="#BradshawEtal1998">Bradshaw <i>et
al.</i>, 1998</a>).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The only other evidence that Wells cites in favor of his
pet theory about how not just evolutionary biologists but
geneticists and developmental biologists have got things
horribly wrong is an anecdote about a single lecturer he
met at a single meeting in Germany in 1999. Based on the
vague description it sounds like the lecturer was
critiquing oversimplified models of connections between
genes and development (and environment, which is also
important), but of course anyone in Evo-Devo is well aware
of these kinds of complexities.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>I know that the tolerant teacher should operate under
the philosophy that there is no such thing as a dumb
question, but Wells manages to ask a fantastically dumb one
on page 192. He asks, "If our developmental genes are
similar to those of other animals, why don't we give birth
to fruit flies instead of human beings?" I don't know if
Wells thinks that the Intelligent Designer is continually
intervening to keep organisms reproducing after their kind
or what, but several answers that would occur to anyone who
has done any degree of serious thinking on this issue would
include (a) similar genes are not identical genes; (b)
small differences in regulation of genes can result in big
changes; (c) the action of a gene (or the protein from a
gene) will depend on both genetic and environmental
context; and particularly (d) different combinations and
arrangements of similar genes can result in very different
patterns. Any serious discussion would consider these
blindingly obvious possibilities in detail.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10: Fossil Horses and Directed Evolution</h2>

<p>It is evident from the chapter title that Wells can find
no particular beef with fossil horses; not only do they not
make the list of criteria for textbook evaluation, they
don't even make Wells' list of "10 questions to ask your
biology teacher" (at: <a href=
"http://www.iconsofevolution.com/tools/questions.php3">http://www.iconsofevolution.com/tools/questions.php3</a>).
There is an obvious question ("Aren't fossil horses pretty
darn good evidence for microevolution adding up to
macroevolution"), but it seems unlikely that it will be
added to the list. For a detailed introduction to fossil
horses see <a href="#Hunt1995">Hunt (1995)</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>What Wells apparently wants people to believe is that
the evolution of horses <i>was</i> directed. Wells argues
that biologists have vigorously tried correct to correct
the old horse icon (linear evolution) because they are all
trying to prove that evolution is undirected. Of course,
all anyone can argue scientifically about such metaphysical
matters is that the pattern doesn't <i>look</i> like it's
going anywhere in particular (just like it doesn't
<i>look</i> like the occurence of a tornado is directed in
any obvious way). Whether evolution is directed, or not
directed, in some cosmic sense is not determinable by
science. Wells makes this point when he says that the
hypothesis of directed evolution cannot be disproved by the
bush-like pattern of evidence.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Wells, though, tries to have it both ways, keeping his
pet notion of directed evolution unfalsifiable by evidence,
but also trying to discern supporting evidence for directed
evolution in the fossil horse record.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Wells writes (p. 199), "The mere existence of extinct
side-branches doesn't rule out the possibility that the
evolution of modern horses was directed. A cattle drive has
a planned destination, even though some steers might stray
along the way." <i>Icons</i> reviewer Jim Dawson called
this passage, "an incredible analogy that evokes an image
of God as a cowboy" (<a href="#Dawson2001">Dawson,
2001</a>).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Wells, in his figure 10-2 (p. 200) on the modern fossil
horse record, appears to be engaging in the incredibly
ironic task of trying to restore an old, discredited icon
of evolution! He leaves out most of the extinct side
branches (and there are very many of those in any real
treatment of horse evolution, see Hunt, 1995), and uses an
extra-heavy line to trace the lineage from
<i>Hyracotherium</i> to the modern <i>Equus</i>. In the
caption he pens the following earthshaking observation:
"Note that although the new pattern is not linear, it still
shows a continuous lineage connecting <i>Hyracotherium</i>
with the modern horse." Of course, there is a similar
lineage connecting <i>Hyracotherium</i> to every extinct
species, also, except that they all went extinct. In fact,
(assuming no special creation of species) every currently
living creature will have a continuous lineage back to its
ancestors, and every extinct creature, well, won't. If
Wells writes another book on science, perhaps he'd like to
move into physics and discuss the profound truth that you
can't see the sun at night.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>On page 202 Wells finally gets around to discussing what
is probably the topic that really motivates him (and the ID
movement), namely the supposed nasty philosophical biases
inherent in evolutionary biology. This has been discussed
extensively by others elsewhere and has nothing to do with
fossil horses and precious little to do with textbooks, so
for the most part we will move on. Two points should be
made about the words like "random", and "undirected," which
Wells digs out of several textbooks (as if the purpose of a
science textbook is to be a philosophical treatise suitable
for word-by-word analysis for conceivably debatable
points).</p>
</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<p>Readers should ask themselves: is the weather "random"
and "undirected", or not?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If yes, according to Wells you are subscribing to
"materialistic philosophy in the guise of empirical
science" and we should expect Wells to write his next book
about the dogmatic materialism of meteorologists (and
statisticians, etc.).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If you think that Wells may be overreacting a wee bit to
the implications of such words (perhaps because of the
provocation provided by certain campaigners for atheism
such as Dawkins, who is an excellent zoologist but who
should do a better job of keeping his metaphysics separate
from his science), then join the club, and consider the
possibility that evolution is "random" and "undirected" in
the very same way that the weather is considered "random"
and "undirected." (for a reasonable discussion of the
philosophical issues and of the motivations of the ID
movement see <a href="#Pennock1999">Pennock, 1999</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Along these lines, it is worth pointing out that the
first "random and undirected" quote that Wells brings up
(p. 206) is from a textbook by known Christian Kenneth
Miller, a devout Catholic who is the leading biologist in
the anti-ID movement (see his <a href=
"http://biomed.brown.edu/Faculty/M/Miller/Miller.html">website</a>
and his book, <a href="#Miller1999">Miller (1999)</a>,
which very sympathetically discusses the religious issues
surrounding the modern evolution debate, including the
anti-religious tendencies of several biologists that IDists
love to quote).</p>

<h2>Chapter 11: From Ape to Human: The Ultimate Icon</h2>

<p>At long last, we come to The Ultimate Icon, the one on
the cover of <i>Icons of Evolution</i>: the March From Ape
to Man. However, at this point Wells seems to have
completely lost track of textbooks, which you may recall
were supposed to be the topic of the book (this Icon does
not appear in Wells' evaluation criteria on page 249,
either). The only mentions of textbooks in this chapter are
listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>(1) Wells says "Most modern biology textbooks do not
even mention Piltdown" (p. 217)</p>
</li>

<li>(2) Apparently the only thing Wells could find that was
juicy enough to quote in a chapter on 'The Ultimate Icon'
was from an interview of Stephen J. Gould in Raven and
Johnson's <i>Biology</i>, where Gould gives his well-known
view that "Humans represent just one tiny, largely
fortuitous, and late-arising twig on the enormously
arborescent bush of life." Several points are worth
making:</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Interviews are different from the body of the text, and
it is precisely the place where scientists giving their
personal views is perfectly appropriate.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Evaluated as science, the only word which is at all
questionable in the Gould quote is "fortuitous."
Interpreted charitably it is even more mild than "random"
and "undirected" that were discussed above. Wells of course
packs all his vitriol towards Gould's philosophy of
contingency into that single word, growling in disgust,
"Like so many other things we have encountered, this is not
science, but myth." (p. 228)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>And finally, Gould's statement is in direct conflict
with the ape-to-man icon that Wells purports to be
critiquing in this chapter, and which Wells put on the
cover of <i>Icons of Evolution!</i></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>It seems likely that Wells couldn't find even a single
modern textbook that contained the "Ape-to-Man" icon -- if
they did, Wells would be sure to include them (it is
possible than an occasional textbook includes the icon to
criticize it). I myself distinctly remember my general
biology professor putting up such an "Ape-to-Man" icon, and
informing the class in no uncertain terms that this was an
inaccurate and outdated view of human evolution. The
professor then put up some of the numerous spoofs and
cartoons of the icon that she had collected, to make the
point, and then put up the modern view, which is that human
evolution follows the branching pattern so common elsewhere
in evolution. Unlike in his horse chapter, Wells makes no
attempt to show readers this new, more accurate, icon.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>For that matter, Wells spends precious little of this
chapter discussing the actual modern fossil evidence. Pages
212-214 are on Darwin's opinions in <i>Descent of Man</i>,
pages 214-216 are about the interpretation of Neanderthal
fossils in the late 1800's, and pages 217-219 are about
Piltdown man, which it seems no creationist book on
evolution is complete without; see the Piltdown Man webpage
for extensive references on the topic (<a href=
"http://www.tiac.net/users/cri/piltdown.html">http://www.tiac.net/users/cri/piltdown.html</a>).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Wells actually gets around to discussing an important
fossil skull for a bit on page 219 (1470, a likely <i>Homo
habilis</i>, see <a href=
"/faqs/homs/1470.html">www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/1470.html</a>
for a picture and links), but then hares off for six pages
interpreting other peoples' interpretations of the
interpretations of anthropologists of the hominid fossil
record. Nowhere does Wells actually give the reader any
specific idea of what the fossils are like, what their
measurements and dates are, etc. Fortunately, an excellent
resource on the web allows you to examine the pictures
yourself and draw your own conclusions (The Fossil Hominids
FAQ, <a href=
"/faqs/homs/">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/</a>).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Wells (p. 220) quotes Henry Gee writing that all the
evidence for human evolution "between about 10 and 5
million years ago [...] can be fitted into a small box."
But appallingly, Wells somehow fails to inform his readers
that plenty of fossils exist from 0-5 million years ago,
which, as <a href="#Scott2001">Eugenie C. Scott (2001)</a>
pointed out in her review of Wells in <i>Science</i>, "is
when humans evolved." Using Wells' standards, a witness at
a murder trial would be permitted to say that he saw
nothing untoward between noon and six, and yet leave out
the fact that he saw a murder at seven.</p>
</li>

<li>Wells focuses on controversies surrounding
interpretation, but why worry about that when you can see
the darn fossils for yourself online and make up your own
mind? Go here: <a href=

<h2>Conclusion -- Jonathan Wells' book: Science or
Myth?</h2>

<p>This concludes the tour of Jonathan Wells' <i>Icons of
Evolution</i>. At the end of <i>Icons</i>, Wells includes
an Appendix where he "grades" ten recent biology textbooks,
giving most of them an F (Campbell <i>et al.</i>'s
<i>Biology</i> -- probably the most popular college biology
text, by the way -- comes out on top with a D+). Wells then
includes "<a href=
"http://www.iconsofevolution.com/tools/">warning
labels</a>", which look suspiciously like cigarette warning
labels, which Wells thinks should be put in textbooks.</p>

Has Wells succeeded in making the case which would justify
his harsh judgements? Let us recall what Wells' argument
was supposed to be: 

<blockquote>"Some biologists are aware of difficulties with
a particular icon because it distorts the evidence in their
own field. When they read the scientific literature in
their specialty, they can see that the icon is misleading
or downright false. But they may feel that this is just an
isolated problem, especially when they are assured that
Darwin's theory is supported by overwhelming evidence from
other fields. If they believe in the fundamental
correctness of Darwinian evolution, they may set aside
their misgivings about the particular icon they know
something about." (<i>Icons</i>, pp. 7-8)</blockquote>

<p>But as we have seen, in every single case, the actual
biological experts <i>in their specific fields of
expertise</i> in fact agree that the actual evidence <i>in
their field</i> supports modern evolutionary theory.
Furthermore, many of these scientists have felt
sufficiently strongly about this that they have published
critiques of creationist misinterpretations of their work.
Many of these scientists have felt sufficiently victimized
by Wells to write specific rebuttals of him.</p>

<p>Wells might try to argue that he was talking about the
"icons" rather than the general evidence in the field, but
still his argument fails. In the cases of the Miller-Urey
experiment, Darwin's tree of life, vertebrate limb
homology, <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, peppered moths, and
Darwin's finches, a fair investigation of the literature
has revealed that Wells has no case, and that these "Icons"
are fully deserving of inclusion in biology textbooks. In
the cases of the four-winged fruit fly, fossil horses, and
fossil hominids, we discover that Wells has not even
included these cases in his textbook "evaluation" criteria
-- perhaps inclusion of these in the criteria would have
raised the textbook grades too much. In any case it is
evident that Wells' problems with the four-winged fruit
fly, fossil horses, and fossil hominids are not really with
textbooks, but with extraneous issues -- the real issues in
these cases are Wells' bizarre views about the relationship
between genes and development, and his paranoia that
biology textbooks are pushing the view that life is
meaningless and purposeless. I will have a few final words
on this subject in a moment, as it is an oft-recurring
theme in antievolutionist writings.</p>

<p>The single "icon" where Wells has some success is with
Haeckel's embryos: the fraction of textbooks that use
Haeckel's drawings should replace them with photographs or
more accurate drawings. But even here, the very authority
that Wells cites against Haeckel's embryos, namely M.K.
Richardson, has clearly stated that the <i>actual</i> facts
of embryology do indeed support evolutionary theory,
contradicting Wells' interpretation. As Wells' argument is
explicitly based on the views of the experts in their
fields, then Wells, to be self-consistent, would have to
concede that he has only scored a point against certain
textbooks, and not against the theory of evolution.</p>

<p>However, let us be generous and grant Wells a full point
for the Haeckel's embryos case. On the other nine "icons,"
though, Wells has come up empty-handed. So Wells has earned
a 1 out of 10. Even a generous curve would not save Wells
from a flunking grade. One would think that a guy with a
Ph.D. from Berkeley would have done better.</p>

<p>The only thing more discouraging than Wells' grade are
the rave reviews that Wells got from his peers at his
current workplace, the <a href=
"http://www.discovery.org">Discovery Institute</a>. Wells'
fellows at the Discovery Institute's <a href=
"http://www.discovery.org/crsc/faq/index.html">Center for
the Renewal of Science and Culture</a> lavished praise on
<i>Icons of Evolution</i>, with nary a word of criticism or
even mild questioning. Sure, we might expect
antievolutionist demagogues to do their usual braying; for
example, in his typically balanced style Phil Johnson
writes of <i>Icons</i>, "This is one of the most important
books ever written about the evolution controversy. It
shows how devotion to the ideology of Darwinism has led to
textbooks which are full of misinformation." But even
Michael Behe, who does know some biology and really should
have known better, has apparently become radicalized enough
to write, "Jonathan Wells demonstrates with stunning
clarity that the textbook examples Darwinists themselves
chose as the pillars of their theory are all false or
misleading. What does this imply about their scientific
standards? Why should anyone now believe any of their other
examples?" This is the same Behe, you will recall, who
accepted the evidence for common descent -- i.e. the tree
of life -- as recently as 1996. What is the intellectual
status of a movement like Intelligent Design that cannot
bring itself to question even the most outrageous of
Jonathan Wells' distortions? (for the above reviews and
others, see this URL: <a href=
"http://www.iconsofevolution.net/reviews/">http://www.iconsofevolution.net/reviews/</a>)</p>

<p>I have only had time to refute the major arguments that
Wells raises in <i>Icons</i>; unfortunately this only
scratches the surface. A truly thorough refutation would
take a full book, and one rather longer than <i>Icons</i>
at that. I fear that I have not given readers a sufficient
impression of just how deceptive and devious a writer
Jonathan Wells is. Through most of the book, virtually
<i>every sentence</i> contains some sort of illegitimate
slant, whether quoting a scientist out of context, or
leaving out crucial pieces of information, or presenting a
nonexpert opinion as an authoritative one, or simply
spewing out unsupported exclamations of doubt, derison, and
"dogmatic Darwinism!" <i>Icons</i> is an impressive bit of
propaganda, and frankly, Jonathan Wells is probably the
slickest operator that the antievolution movement has ever
produced. His book, packed with quotes and authoritative
declarations, mangling topic after topic in rapid
succession, is a calculated attempt to overwhelm the reader
by sheer diversity of material; even the biologically
educated reader is not likely to have the necessary
background to spot all of Wells' tricks. Writing this
review required a substantial amount of research and help
from numerous veteran creationism/ID debaters (see <a href=
"#acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a>).</p>

<p>But Wells' cleverest move of all was to attack
<i>textbooks</i> rather than taking on the science
directly. The all too common response, even from
biologists, has been along the lines of "Well, sure,
textbooks have problems, but this doesn't effect the theory
of evolution." <i>This is falling into Wells' trap.</i>
This review has shown that the topics discussed actually do
belong in textbooks, and do constitute good evidence for
evolution, according to the evidence and according to the
experts that Wells claims for support. The book <i>Icons of
Evolution</i> is the real scientific travesty.</p>

<br />
 <a name="about"></a> 

<p><b>What is <i>Icons</i> really about?</b></p>

<p>The central irony of <i>Icons of Evolution</i> is that,
while biologists no longer accept and indeed actively
debunk the "March From Ape-to-Man" image on the cover, it
appears to be closer to something that <i>Wells</i>
believes. He apparently does not deny common ancestry of
humans with animals; on page 223 (in the middle of six
pages of selective quoting about the subjectivity and
disagreements in paleontology) Wells admits, "Obviously,
the human species has a history. Many fossils have been
found that appear to be genuine, and many of them have some
features that are ape-like and some that are human-like."
It seems like Wells' next sentence ought to be "Sorry for
all the trouble, folks, I guess I got a little carried away
with this book...", but of course it isn't. As far as
anyone can tell, Wells has the idea that "the human species
was planned before life began, and that the history of life
is the record of how this plan was implemented" (see his
essay "Evolution and Design," online here: <a href=
"http://www.tparents.org/Library/Unification/Talks/Wells/0-Toc.htm">
http://www.tparents.org/Library/Unification/Talks/Wells/0-Toc.htm</a>).
In other words, to Wells, evolution (with some unspecified
touch of ID) <b><i>was</i></b> marching towards a goal of
humans, <i>just like Apes-to-Man icon on the cover of</i>
Icons of Evolution! It seems likely that the insertion of
this metaphysical idea into science education, as science,
is Wells' real goal.</p>

<p>But is it really necessary to force theology into
science? As we saw in the fossil horses chapter, Wells
imputes far more metaphysical significance to words such as
"random" and "undirected" than they actually have
scientifically. Scientifically, evolution is described as
"random" and "undirected" in the same way that the weather,
earthquakes, and numerous other natural processes are
described as "random" and "undirected." (For that matter,
evolution is also predictable in a way similar to weather
and earthquakes.) Does describing the weather, or
evolution, as somewhat "random" really have the offensive
metaphysical implications that Wells thinks?</p>

<p>For an alternative model, we should investigate the
central quote of Wells' last chapter. Wells is severely
offended by Dobzhansky's statement "Nothing in biology
makes sense except in the light of evolution" and decries
all of the evil materialist-naturalist metaphysics he sees
in it. But Wells, as usual, fails to give his reader
crucial information: Wells fails to say anything about
Dobzhansky's <i>actual</i> metaphysics: Dobzhansky was a
life-long Russian orthodox Christian. Here are some more
quotes from the very same article by Dobzhansky (1973),
which is available online at <a href=
"http://www.2think.org/dobzhansky.shtml">http://www.2think.org/dobzhansky.shtml</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It is wrong to hold creation and evolution as mutual
exclusive alternatives. I am a creationist <i>and</i> an
evolutionist. Evolution is God's, or Nature's, method of
creation. Creation is not an event that happened in 4004
B.C.; it is a process that began some 10 billion years ago
and is still under way."</p>

<p>"Does the evolutionary doctrine clash with religious
faith? It does not. It is a blunder to mistake the Holy
Scriptures for elementary textbooks of astronomy, geology,
biology, and anthropology. Only if symbols are construed to
mean what they are not intended to mean can there arise
imaginary, insoluble conflicts. As pointed out above, the
blunder leads to blasphemy; the Creator is accused of
systematic deceitfulness." (Dobzhansky T., 1973, "Nothing
in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution",
<i>American Biology Teacher</i> 35:125-9)</p>

<p><a name="ftn3"></a> [3] It may be objected here that Sargent (of the paper
Sargent, Millar, and Lambert, 1998, "The "classical"
explanation of industrial melanism: assessing the
evidence," in <i>Evolutionary Biology</i>,
<b>30</b>:299-322), is a moth researcher. This is true, but
most of Sargent's work appears to be on moth species
<i>other</i> than peppered moths, such as the genus
<i>Catocala</i>. In genera such as <i>Catocala</i> the
situation regarding industrial melanism and selection
appears to be different. Majerus barely cites Sargent at
all in his detailed review of peppered moths in
<i>Industrial Melanism: Evolution in Action</i>.</p>

<p>Regarding the Sargent <i>et al.</i> paper, which is the
major source for those proclaiming the downfall of the
classical peppered moth story, an under-realized fact is
that it is formally a review of industrial melanism in
<i>moths in general</i>, and in many species other than the
peppered moth (<i>Biston betularia</i>) the evidence is
indeed poor that the "classical explanation" (selective
predation against backgrounds changing due to pollution)
applies. Peppered moths of course come up repeatedly as
they are the species on which the most work has been done,
and the authors do question the classical explanation for
peppered moths as well. However, the peppered moth experts
are unimpressed, just as they were unimpressed by a 1986
paper by some of the same authors (Lambert, Millar, and
Hughes (1986), "On the classic case of natural selection",
<i>Rivista di Biologia</i>, 79:11-49.). Here is Cook's
(2000) take:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Work by H. B. D. Kettlewell suggested that selective
predation was the main determining factor in B. betularia,
and probably in a wide range of other examples as well. His
evidence consisted of surveys which put the correlation
between melanic frequencies and urbanization on a
quantitative basis (Kettlewell, 1958, 1965), demonstration
that wild birds would eat the moths if they found them
(Kettlewell, 1955), and the now famous demonstration that
birds discovered most readily the forms least like the
daytime backgrounds on which they rested (Kettlewell, 1973;
Rudge, 1999). Colour of resting background and
heterogeneity due to epiphyte cover, appeared to affect
relative visibility. Selective predation became the
accepted explanation for the rise in morph frequency
(Majerus, 1998).</p>

<p>Since then, further evidence has been collected. Over
the last two decades industrial environments have become
cleaner and melanic frequencies lower (Clarke <i>et
al.</i>, 1990; Mani &amp; Majerus, 1993; Grant et al.,
1998; Cook et al., 1999). There has also been some revision
of interpretation. It has been shown that experiments
designed to detect and measure selective predation were
carried out in places where moths were not usually likely
to rest if left to their own devices (Mikkola, 1979, 1984;
Liebert &amp; Brakefield, 1987; Grant &amp; Howlett, 1988;
Majerus, 1998). There is by no means a one-to-one relation
between reversion of morph frequency and reversion of
epiphyte pattern (Bates et al., 1990; Grant et al., 1998).
These findings cause us to reexamine the story, but they do
not obviously require a radical revision. Estimations of
selection appear to show a correspondence between fitness
and frequency. The correlation between the condition of the
sites used in experimental studies and those actually used
by the insects is likely to be high. Further lines of
experimentation are suggested, but no previously held view
has been overturned.</p>

<p>The general tone of commentary on Biston studies has,
however, altered. From being treated as a vivid
demonstration of natural selection (Luria, Gould &amp;
Singer, 1981, provide an excellent example) and good field
experimentation (Hagen, 1999), the work concerned has come
to be viewed with suspicion (Sermonti &amp; Catastini,
1984; Cherfas, 1987). In a recent review by Sargent <i>et
al.</i> (1998) almost every reference to past work is
predicated by expressions of doubt, reworking ground
covered by Lambert <i>et al.</i> (1986). When discussing
predation experiments they conclude ". . . there seems to
be no clear and consistent relationship between the
relative survivorship of different morphs . . . and the
frequencies at which the morphs naturally occur in
different environments". Coyne (1998) adopts a similar
tone, saying that the flaws in the work are too numerous to
list. This has led to some alarming reporting, such as
Matthews (1999) in the Daily Telegraph newspaper in
Britain, who refers to a "series of scientific blunders"
and states that the experiments are "now thought to be
worthless". This article in turn was linked in its
electronic web version to the Creation Science home page.
Recent commentaries are quoted on more than one
anti-evolution web site. A balanced account, which shows
the strength of the data in the face of recent criticism,
has been provided by Grant (1999). I propose here to
illustrate the predation results, which Sargent <i>et
al.</i> did not do when they criticized them, and to
consider why a radical change in view should have
occurred.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cook's conclusion about the state of the evidence and
the somewhat baffling criticism the peppered moth story has
received:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>

<p>In industrial melanism of <i>Biston betularia</i>, both
the original increase and recent decline in frequency of
melanics are striking examples of natural genetic change
closely related to change in the environment. They must
have a selective basis. The experiments demonstrate
selective removal. There is a general correspondence of
morph frequency and appearance of backgrounds likely to be
adult resting sites. None of this is in doubt. The evidence
is, however, limited in two ways. First, non-visual
components of selection have not been investigated directly
in this species. Analysis of segregating progenies suggests
pre-adult survival differences (Creed et al., 1980) with
<i>carbonaria</i> homozygotes having an advantage over
other morphs. Non-visual selection is certainly indicated
in studies of other melanic moths (Bishop &amp; Cook,
1980), but we have little more idea than Leigh (1911) how
it may operate.</p>

<p>Secondly, the experimental and observational evidence
cannot on its own carry the burden of a particular view of
evolution, such as found in Oxford ecological genetics.
Smocovitis (1996) describes how the view of the
[Neodarwinian Modern] Synthesis with which it was
associated came to seem 'constricted' to many students of
evolution, and to generate a reaction in favour of more
complex models; the last three decades have been a period
of lively debate and controversy. Distrust of the evidence
of industrial melanism may sometimes arise from a wish to
question how the example relates to more complex levels of
evolutionary theory. Criticism on these grounds is
misplaced, and can attract the attention of advocates of
creationism who see an evolutionary field in apparent
disarray. The <i>Biston</i> story continues to provide an
exceptional opportunity to analyse a pattern of selection.
It should be pursued, along with study of other species
with related but different responses to environmental
change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It should also be pointed out that while Sargent appears
skeptical of some of the evidence for the classical
peppered moth story, he has no problem with the general
idea of cryptic (camoflague) coloration in moths; he writes
that the classical explanation is "eminently reasonable",
and furthermore he has himself published on crypsis in
moths. A very interesting webpage on Sargent's observation
of the behavior of another moth species, <i>Catocala
relicta</i>, is online here: <a href=
"http://bcrc.bio.umass.edu/kunkel/Moths/relicta_story.html">
http://bcrc.bio.umass.edu/kunkel/Moths/relicta_story.html</a>.
Notably, the evidence is <i>against</i> this kind of "find
a matching background" behavior in peppered moths. Peppered
moths appear to just look for shaded spots (such as beneath
trunk-branch joints), whether or not the moth is dark or
light colored. As Sargent <i>et al.</i> grudgingly
acknowledge, this is actually a good thing for the classic
selection-by-bird predation story for peppered moths, as
picking-matching-background behavior would actually
constitute negative feedback that would <i>weaken</i> the
effects of natural selection (i.e., as tree surfaces got
darker, the moths would just behaviorally move to lighter
surfaces that matched their camoflague).</p>

<p>Regarding Jerry Coyne's (1998) review of Majerus' book
<i>Industrial Melanism</i> in <i>Nature</i> (online <a
href=
"http://rnaworld.bio.ukans.edu/Evolve/links/Coyne/Coyne_review(1998)Nature396,35.html">
here</a>), readers should not allow Coyne's excellent
reputation as a nonsense debunker to dissuade them from
recognizing that Coyne's review contains at least one
glaring mistake: namely, Coyne writes, "Majerus notes that
the most serious problem is that <i>B. betularia</i>
probably does not rest on tree trunks -- exactly two moths
have been seen in such a position in more than 40 years of
intensive search. The natural resting spots are, in fact, a
mystery." However, Coyne somehow fails to mention that in
the very next paragraph of Majerus' book (pp. 121-122),
Majerus cites his own data on the natural resting places of
moths -- some 47 moths -- not a lot, but far more than two.
This data, listed in Table 6.1 of Majerus' page 123,
indicates that peppered moths in fact rest in diverse
locations (12 on tree trunks, 20 on "trunk-branch joints",
and 15 in tree branches). Similar percentages are found in
Table 6.2 on a larger dataset of resting moths found near
traps.</p>

<p>All of this serves to illustrate that Coyne's opinion on
the classical peppered moth explanation is by no means
definitive. Wells, of course, gives readers very little of
the above complexity of the true situation, and instead
quotes the juicy bits of Coyne's review. Wells' own
treatment of moth resting locations appears to be
deliberately deceptive. Wells refers to Clarke <i>et
al</i>'s (1985) reference to the two moths collected
(Clarke was basis for Coyne's remark also), and goes on to
selectively quote two additional papers on the topic of
resting locations, as well as Majerus' book, to support the
notion that moths don't rest on tree trunks. In the notes
(p. 304) Wells buries a reference to Majerus' book amongst
the other papers, and refers readers only to page 116 of
Majerus' book, when in fact the section "The resting
behaviour of peppered moths", including the tables, is
found on pp. 121-123. Why does Wells not just put the
numbers, which are the best anyone has, in the text for his
audience to read?</p>
