<H4>Obvious VCL Bugs </H4>
<P>As best I recall, the specific Windows messages that
  were problems were: 
</P> 
<P>BCB 1.0 has a number of bugs.&nbsp; New Windows API
  messages were added to take advantage of the large amount
  of text that a Rich Edit control can handle.&nbsp; The BCB
  1.0 TRichEdit used the older messages and, therefore, could
  not handle large documents properly.

<P>These messages work fine for small documents but, if you
  want to use BCB 1.0 TRichEdit controls with large text
  files, you will need to write your own code to set or get
  the current selection, set the maximum amount of text the
  control can hold, get the line number from an offset
  position in the text, and find text in the control. 
</P> 
<P>Most of these appear to be fixed in BCB 3.0.&nbsp;
  However, both BCB 1.0 and 3.0 use the EM_FINDTEXT message
  instead of the EM_FINDTEXTEX message to implement the
  FindText() method.&nbsp; I am somewhat unclear on whether
  this is a problem.&nbsp; If it is, you will need to write
  your own routine to use EM_FINDTEXTEX. 
</P> 
<H4>Another Type Of Bug </H4>
<P>So much for VCL code that clearly has bugs.&nbsp; There
  is another type of bug that falls into the &quot;unexpected
  behavior&quot; or &quot;unnecessary limitation&quot; or
  &quot;might be a feature&quot; category. 
</P> 
<P>The first of these has to do with the undocumented fact
  that the VCL occasionally deletes and re-creates the
  TRichEdit control's underlying Windows Rich Edit.&nbsp; See
  the paper titled &quot; Window handles vs. TRichEdit (and
  other VCL) controls&quot; available on this site for more
  information.&nbsp; If you have not read this paper, please
  do -- otherwise, you are almost guaranteed to spend many
  hours chasing this one down. 
</P> 
<P>A second might-be-a-feature-but-is-a-bug-to-me has to do
  with the non-granularity of text styles.&nbsp; Ok, that
  phrasing is more than a little obscure.&nbsp; What I mean
  is this:&nbsp; If you change a text style say, to italics,
  any other styles in the selected text are lost.&nbsp; For
  example, assume that you have selected text that looks like
  this: 
</P> <BLOCKQUOTE>this is normal text, <B>this is bold
text</B>, <U>this is underlined text</U></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To add the italics style to the text, you might try to
  use code something like this: 
</P> <PRE STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">RichEdit1-&gt;SelAttributes-&gt;Style = RichEdit1-&gt;SelAttributes &lt;&lt; fsItalic;</PRE>

<P> The resulting text would look like this: 
</P> <BLOCKQUOTE><I>this is normal text, this is bold text,
this is underlined text</I> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>instead of like this: 
</P> <BLOCKQUOTE><I>this is normal text, <B>this is bold
text</B>, <U>this is </U><U>underlined text</U></I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Ok....&nbsp; What happened?&nbsp; Well, the style
  returned by RichEdit1-&gt;SelAttributes was the style of
  the first character in the selected range (in this case,
  normal text, no bold or underlined attributes).&nbsp; The
  code then added the fsItalic attribute to the returned
  value and then applies this combination of attributes to
  the selected text. 
</P> 
<P>I would prefer -- actually, I expected -- the bold and
  underlined text remain bold and underlined with the italics
  added.&nbsp; Obviously not.&nbsp; Had the VCL treated each
  style as a separate property, this would work as I would
  want and expected it to work. 
</P> 
<P>Unfortunately, since the VCL treats all of the styles as
  a single property, this is not what you get.&nbsp; The Rich
  Edit 2.0 sample code on this site demonstrates how to get
  around this unnecessary limitation.&nbsp; Although written
  for BCB 3.0+, the relevant code should easily back-port to
  BCB 1.0. 
</P> 
<H4>Finally -- True Rich Edit Bugs </H4>
<P>Rich Edit controls definitely have a bug or two.&nbsp;
  Some of these are difficult to classify as true Microsoft
  Rich Edit control bugs, mainly because the Borland VCL does
  some strange things and I do not have the time to trace
  through all of the code.&nbsp; On the other hand, much of
  the code that I have written to handle Rich Edit controls
  bypasses the VCL for exactly that reason.&nbsp; These are
  bugs that I am all but certain are true Rich Edit bugs. 
</P> 
<P>The only case that I will cite here (because of the
  uncertainty factor) is this:&nbsp; If you have text that is
  &quot;normal&quot; and underlined to the left of italicized
  text that is not underlined, the text is drawn to the
  screen with extra space after the italicized text.&nbsp;
  For example, text that should be formatted as: 
</P> <BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>this text contains the word
  &quot;<U><I><B>synch</B></I></U>ronicity&quot; which is
  drawn oddly 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>is drawn as: 
</P> <BLOCKQUOTE>this text contains the word
&quot;<U><I><B>synch&nbsp;</B></I></U>ronicity&quot; which
is drawn oddly </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note the extra underlined space in the middle of the
  word &quot;synchronicity.&quot;&nbsp; This bug appears both
  when the text is displayed in the control (although it
  seems to occur only after formatting the text for a preview
  with the EM_FORMATRANGE message) and when the text is drawn
  on the screen for a preview (which implies that you have
  already formatted the text with the EM_FORMATRANGE
  message).&nbsp; Oddly, the text prints exactly as it
  should. I do not yet have a work-around for this one. 
</P> 
<P>If you spend much time with Rich Edit controls, you will
  almost certainly find other VCL and true Rich Edit
  bugs.&nbsp; If you find more, please send me sample code
  that clearly demonstrates the bug so that we can save
  others a little time.&nbsp; If you have workarounds, please
  share them, too.
