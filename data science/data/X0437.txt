      <p>Grand Island Sportsman's Guide Service is a small operation catering 
        to a small number of hunters located in South Central, New York. Whitetail 
        deer hunting is their primary game animal. Hunts for turkey and small 
        game can also be arranged. Archery season begins annually on October 15th, 
        with shotgun season normally beginning the third Monday of November. It 
        runs for three and a half weeks. Following the shotgun season is a 6-day 
        muzzleloader season and a 5-day late archery season. Local fishing trips 
        on small rivers in canoes, as well as guided fishing with the use of boats 
        on the Upper Niagara River are also available. </p>
      <p>Mark has hunting rights to approximately 300 acres. This land borders 
        both state and other private hunting lands. 35 tree stands are located 
        throughout the property. These are a combination of permanent tree stands 
        and manufactured ladder stands. Most of the stands have a shooting rail 
        or rest surrounding the stand. One of the stands we particularly enjoyed 
        hunting out of was a new stand called a &quot;buddy stand&quot;. They 
        are approximately 12 - 15 feet high, allow ample movement to present shot 
        opportunities from either side or behind you. They are very quiet, safe 
        and easy to maneuver in and out of. The type of land you will be hunting 
        varies from dense woods with shooting visibility of 50 to 75 yards, to 
        more open timber with shot opportunities from 75 to 120 yards. The roads 
        and trails on the property allow easy access to the stands. No climbing 
        or long walks are necessary. </p>

      <p align="left">One of the advantages in hunting this region of New York 
        is the law concerning doe hunting. If non-residents fill out the proper 
        paperwork in the correct time period (mid August) they are eligible for 
        additional doe tags. In addition to archery and muzzleloader season, doe 
        can also be harvested during the gun season. No matter if you are a gun 
        hunter purely looking for venison to bring home, or a hunter only interested 
        in taking a buck, Grand Island Sportsman's Guide Service can accommodate 
        you. Transportation, field dressing, skinning, and quartering of your 
        animal are all included in the package price. </p>
      <p>Kirk and I made the short 3-&frac12; hour drive to Mark's camp from Harrisburg 
        Pa. Thanks to Marks directions we had no trouble finding him. On the way 
        to camp we stopped at a local Wal-Mart to purchase a hunting license. 
        The fee for a non-resident is $100.00. BE SURE TO BRING A LICENSE FROM 
        ANOTHER STATE OR YOUR PROOF OF COMPLETING THE HUNTERS SAFETY COURSE! Upon 
        arrival Mark greeted us and showed us around camp. We stayed in a comfortable 
        cabin heated by the most efficient wood stove I have ever seen. A few 
        logs and it keeps the cabin warm all evening. </p>
      <p>We woke up the morning of our first day of our hunt and were treated 
        to a continental breakfast. Within a few minutes of leaving the camp, 
        Kirk and I were both in our tree stands. With the combination of hunting 
        over a full moon and hunting on the second weekend of gun season Kirk 
        and I both figured taking a buck would be a challenge. The first morning 
        I found myself in a permanent tree stand that many would call a tree house. 
        It was located on the face of a mountain point. Its name was &quot;windy 
        point&quot;. It didn't take me long to figure out how the stand got its 
        name. As the morning passed I saw 3 nice doe. I would have had an easy 
        35-yard shot at any of them, but since I had not purchased my license 
        soon enough I was not eligible for a doe tag. Kirk faired a little better, 
        sighting a mature bodied spike buck with 2 doe coming within 20 yards 
        of his tree stand. Being early in the day, Kirk decided to pass in hopes 
        of a bigger buck coming along later. </p>

      <p>There was some excitement for the camp during the morning hunt however. 
        Mark's brother Jim was on stand not really looking to harvest a buck. 
        He let a mature 8-pointer walk by as he videotaped it. Trailing a few 
        minutes behind the buck was another 8-point buck that was severely injured 
        with a gun shot to the leg. It was clear that the animal had no chance 
        of surviving the winter so Jim decided to harvest the animal. This buck 
        is the last one pictured in the article along with Kirk and I.</p>
      <p>That afternoon Mark, Jim and their assistant Don spent putting small 
        drives for Kirk and I. The second drive of the day pushed two mature bucks 
        to Kirk. Things happened so fast Kirk was unable to get a shot off at 
        either buck. He didn't have a chance to count the exact points on either 
        buck, but he wouldn't have hesitated to take either one had they just 
        given him a chance. That evening we hunted closer to the area that Jim 
        had sighted the other buck. The area looked good, fairly open timber with 
        thick bedding areas located a few 100 yards away. Unfortunately, no deer 
        were on the move that evening. That night we came back for a hot meal 
        and reviewed our strategy for the next morning of our hunt. </p>
      <p>During the last morning of our hunt we sat in stands until 9 am and were 
        unable to see any deer. After that, once again Mark, Jim and Don put on 
        a drive for us. They managed to push some doe by Kirk, but no bucks were 
        among them. Due to our schedules Kirk and I had to leave that afternoon.</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="JustSoPicWindow('images/images_articles/grandisland_deer2.jpg','320','273','* * Click screen to close * *','#336699','hug image','0');return document.MM_returnValue"><img src="images/images_articles/grandisland_deer2.jpg" width="170" height="143" border="0"></a><br>

      <p>It is difficult to provide a true picture of a hunting operation with 
        a late season, day and a half hunting trip. Mark's only client the first 
        week of the gun season, harvested a nice 8-point buck (first buck pictured 
        above). It was taken on the second day. Prior to taking this 8-point buck, 
        the hunter passed on a 4-point buck and a large black bear. Other hunters 
        on stand sighted numerous does and smaller bucks. I think a hunter visiting 
        Mark in the archery season, or the first week of gun season will have 
        an excellent chance at harvesting a buck. If they are only interested 
        in venison, shooting at a doe is almost a guarantee. As the gun season 
        progresses, just as in any state, the bucks get a little wiser and deer 
        activity begins to turn nocturnal. One thing you can count on though, 
        no matter when you hunt with Grand Island Sportsman's Guide Service, Mark 
        and his staff will make every possible effort to put you on deer and ensure 
        that you have an enjoyable hunt. </p>
      <p>As additional land becomes available Mark plans to try and expand his 
        operation. Since Mark caters to small hunting parties of only 2 or 3 hunters, 
        be sure to book early. For further information on <a href="grandisland.html">Grand
