deduction of income tax at the appropriate rate or subject to the required certification,
gross. Where the tax deducted exceeds an investor's tax liability (if any), a claim may be
made to the Inland Revenue for repayment of tax. For individuals whose income falls within
the lower or basic rate bands, the tax deducted will match their liability to tax on the
interest and they will have no more tax to pay on it. Individuals who are liable to tax at
rates above the basic rate bands will have to pay additional tax on the interest to cover
the difference between the tax deducted and the higher rate tax due.</font></p>

form if you need one. If you have any queries on your tax liability you should get in
touch with your Inland Revenue tax office.</font></p>
