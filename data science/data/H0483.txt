<H2>Extreme chemistry</H2>
<P>
<H3>by William Wells</H3>
<I>The next leap forward in laundry detergents
may originate not in a chemist&iacute;s laboratory, but with bacteria
that live on a marine worm, a mile below the ocean surface, and
at temperatures of over 80&#186;C.<BR>
</I>
<P>
Jeff Stein's main task is to sift through
bacterial sludge, but he couldn&iacute;t be happier. His search
for bizarre microbes takes him on dives to the bottom of the ocean,
and forays into geothermal areas and tropical rainforests.
<P>

Stein is a Principal Scientist in charge of
microbial diversity at Diversa Corporation in San Diego, California.
Diversa provides its industrial customers with enzymes, and the
weirder the source, the better. Enzymes are the cell&iacute;s
version of a chemist, capable of converting one chemical to another
with astonishing efficiency and zero toxicity. They are used in
the production of everything from cheese, to perfume, to stone-washed
jeans <A HREF="#tab">Table 1</A>. Enzymes from the single-celled bacteria that
live in extreme environments should, says Stein, be able to withstand
both the harsh conditions in industrial plants and the wear and
tear of everday use by consumers.

<P>
The trick to this approach is direct isolation
of DNA from the bacterial sample. Scientists then search for genes
in the DNA that hold the code for useful enzymes. Going straight
for the DNA allows you to skip the intermediate and tricky step
of growing the bacteria in the laboratory. 
<P>
The method seems to be yielding results. &igrave;This
is reaching out beyond organisms that are well studied,&icirc;
says Norman Pace, of the University of California at Berkeley.
&igrave;I think that is wonderful.&icirc;<BR>


<H3>Boundless diversity<BR>
</H3>
Even in the soil of a temperate garden, there
is an enormous flowering of life. One gram of this soil contains
the DNA of ~10<SUP>9</SUP> bacteria, representing ~10<SUP>4</SUP>
different species. And that is only in the front yard &oacute;
the shady back yard is a whole new universe. &igrave;The vastness
makes the question of &euml;How many?&iacute; irrelevant,&icirc;
says Pace. &igrave;I mean, how many stars are there?&icirc;
<P>
Perhaps, then, Diversa need go no further than
a San Diego garden. But Diversa scientists have faith in their
search for extremophiles, the bacteria that live in harsh environments.
Although 10<SUP>4</SUP> is a lot, 10<SUP>4</SUP> of pretty much
the same thing may not be so useful. Isolated populations of bacteria
in extreme environments probably have enzymes that can direct
novel chemical reactions. And enzymes from thermophilic (heat-loving)
bacteria have several potential advantages. 
<P>
The first is obvious: A number of chemical
processes require enzymes to act, or retain their activity, at
high temperatures (see the first two entries in <A HREF="#tab">Table 1</A>).
<P>
But the main stumbling block for those wishing
to use enzymes in industry has been lack of stability, not lack
of heat-resistance. Enzymes are non-toxic, biodegradable, and
great at doing only what they are told, but they go off. Diversa
recognised that thermophilic enzymes are stable enzymes. Even
if they are to be used at mild temperatures, they last far longer
than regular enzymes. They also resist the destructive effects
of organic chemicals used in other steps of the industrial process.
<BR>


<H3>Geysers, vents, and searching for whales
<BR>
</H3>
The two best sources of thermophilic bacteria
are where the heat of the earth&iacute;s interior comes to the
surface: deep-sea vents, and geothermal pools. In the ocean, 
scientists have used the Alvin submersible to access vents at
sites like the East Pacific rise, ~800 miles off Costa Rica and
~1.5 miles down. The hottest vents have core temperatures of 350-400
&#186;C. These black smokers get their name from the plumes of
precipitated metals that drift into the surrounding sea water,
which is at a temperature of only 2 &#186;C. 
<P>
The centers of the vents are devoid of life,
but as the temperature decreases in the surrounding chimney, core
samples turn up a wealth of thermophiles. Other samples are collected
using either a slurp gun, which filters water from around the
vent, or collection plates seeded with chemicals that attract
bacteria because the microbes see them as lunch. 
<P>
The bacteria can live at temperatures of up
to 113 &#186;C, and in conditions that are extremely salty, acidic,
or alkaline.
<P>
Deep-sea marine animals, or rather the bacteria
living on and in their bodies, are also a good source of biodiversity.
One intriguing recent find is a worm that keeps its tail in the
hot vent and its head in the cool surrounding water. Researchers
are interested in the worm as a source of enzymes that can work
over a broad range of temperatures.
<P>
With their similar temperatures and chemical
makeup, geothermal pools are the terrestrial equivalents of deep-sea
vents, at least for harvesting bacteria (Fig. 1). Deep-sea vents
and geothermal pools also share an island-like quality, isolated
biologically by their unique chemistry. For example, one pool
that Diversa collects from in Costa Rica, at ~95 &#186;C and pH
0, stands in stark contrast to the surrounding rainforest. Diversa
signed a bioprospecting agreement in August giving them access
to Yellowstone National Park, which has over 60% of the world&iacute;s
geysers, hot springs and boiling mud pots.
<P>
Whale skeletons, another source of microbes,
are also like isolated islands, so isolated that they are tricky
to find. The US Navy helped out scientists by locating one when
it was looking for a wayward Triton missile, but in other cases
researchers have resorted to towing dead, beached whales out to
sea and dumping them.
<P>
Isolation is not the only attraction of whale
bones. &igrave;They ooze complex lipids [greasy molecules that
line the outside of cells] over periods of up to 20 years,&icirc;
says Stein. Bacterial mats that grow on the bones are a rich source
of the lipases and esterases needed to break down the lipids,
and these two classes of enzymes are especially important to industry.
The organisms and their enzymes are adapted to the deep-sea cold;
such psychrophilic enzymes can be useful for commercial laundry
detergents. More psychrophilic enzymes are turning up in earth
and lichen samples from Icelandic and Antarctic glaciers.<BR>


<H3>From DNA to enzyme<BR>
</H3>
Harvesting the DNA is relatively non-destructive.
&igrave;A teaspoonful of sample is generally more than we need,&icirc;
says Jay Short, Chief Technology Officer at Diversa. Once they
have the DNA, the job of the scientists becomes more routine.
The DNA contributions of common and rare bacteria are evened out,
then each piece of DNA is cloned into a separate colony of the
ubiquitous laboratory bacterium <I>Escherichia coli</I>. Nanograms
of DNA are enough to make this DNA &euml;library&iacute;.
<P>
Each <I>E. coli</I> in the library can now
make a single enzyme, which is encoded by a fragment of DNA from
a single bacterium in the isolated sample. Scientists then tests
whether this enzyme does the chemical conversion that they want
it to do. Testing for the final property of the enzyme &igrave;gives
us the opportunity to select without any prior knowledge of what
the genes should look like,&icirc; says Short.<BR>


<H3>Applications<BR>
</H3>
The most obvious use for enzymes is the degradation
of chemicals found in nature, as those products might be similar
to chemicals that the enzymes normally encounter <A HREF="#tab">Table 1</A>. The
specificity of enzymes also makes them a powerful tool in the
synthesis of pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. Chemical synthesis
of pharmaceuticals often gives two stereoisomers, molecules that
have identical numbers and types of atoms, but are mirror images
of each other. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is particularly
concerned about stereoisomers of approved drugs, which can either
be inactive or, worse, toxic. Enzymes are often the only way to
differentiate between stereoisomers, as they usually react with
only one stereoisomer.
<P>
Scientists have big plans for this market.
&igrave;We&iacute;re trying to replace enzymes already in use,
and also open the door to using enzymes in other processes where
they haven&iacute;t been used before,&icirc; says Dan Robertson,
Director of Enzymology at Diversa. That
approach is needed, says Pace, because the biotechnology industry
has, in the past, relied on &quot;stuff that has fallen into our
pockets. There has been relatively little seeking out.&quot; Diversa
is not alone, however. Thermogen (Chicago, Illinois) has found
a number of enzymes in the species of heat-loving bacteria that
can be grown in the laboratory, and are now looking for other
bacteria in the wild.  Altus Biologics, Inc. (Cambridge, Massachusetts)
has taken a very different approach to the stability problem.
They add a chemical to purified, crystallized enzymes so that
many enzyme molecules are linked together to form a stable enzyme
pellet. The cross-linked crystals are stable to heat and organic
chemicals, and have a long shelf-life.<BR>

<P>
In an area that Diversa has entered
recently the competition is fiercer still. Along with ChromaXome
(San Diego, California) and TerraGen Diversity, Inc. (Vancouver,
British Columbia), Diversa is looking to discover new drugs made
by bacteria. The companies will test natural products, the chemicals
that bacteria make either to do a job in the cell, or to kill
other bacteria (the antibiotics). &quot;We think that the vast
majority of natural product pharmaceuticals have yet to be discovered,&quot;
says Stein.<BR>

<P>
The search is based on the fact
that many related bacterial genes are clumped together. By isolating
huge fragments of DNA, Stein thinks he has a good chance of picking
up all the genes he needs to make an antibiotic in one fell swoop.
All the current antibiotics are natural products or minor variants
of natural products. With so many bacteria undiscovered, it seems
all but certain that there are more drugs just waiting to be found,
buried in anything from thermal vents to garden soil. And finding
them might be easier than trial-and-error testing of chemicals
made by humans. &quot;Evolution has been doing a lot of tinkering
over the years,&quot; says Pace, &quot;and you may as well take
advantage of it.&quot;<BR>
