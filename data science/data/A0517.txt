<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica" SIZE=2>
<B>You injure your leg and can't work for three months. Your partner has to convalesce from an operation. Your boss calls you in and says they're going to have to let you go.<P>

There are all kinds of reasons why you can find yourself without an income.<P>

Unfortunately when your income dries up, the bills don't.<P>

You still have to pay the mortgage each month. Which means you end up adding financial worries to everything else.<P>

There is a way you can protect your mortgage payments and other financial commitments though.
Payment Protection is a simple, low cost insurance policy that offers real peace of mind. Leaving you free to make a full recovery or look for a new job.</B><P>

<A NAME="how"></A>
<B>HOW PAYMENT PROTECTION WORKS WHEN YOU CAN'T</B><P>

Payment Protection can protect your mortgage payments for twelve months if you become unemployed and/or are off work because of sickness or an accident.<P>

When you consider that Government statistics show a 25 year old man has a one in three chance of being disabled for three months or more before reaching 65, you'll realise how valuable Payment Protection is.<P>

You can also opt to extend your policy by up to 100% to safeguard other payments - such as endowment premiums, home insurance premiums and household bills.<P>

The other good news is that all these benefits are tax free.<P>

There are two cover options available:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Full Accident, Sickness and Unemployment;
<LI>Accident and Sickness only.
</UL><P>

For your complete protection, we recommend the full Accident, Sickness and Unemployment policy.<P>

<A NAME="price"></A>
<B>THE PRICE OF PEACE OF MIND</B><P>

When you consider all that it offers, Payment Protection is excellent value for money.<P>

First, you decide the amount of cover you need in multiples of &#163;25. This can be up to a maximum benefit of 200% of your monthly mortgage payment. A limit is set of &pound;1,500 per month for a single applicant, or &pound;3,000 per month for joint applicants.<P>

For joint mortgages, both parties can now choose to insure up to 200% of their monthly mortgage payment.<P>

The monthly benefit for each person must not be more than twice your monthly mortgage payment.<P>

The minimum benefit allowed is &pound;100. The cost of this insurance is shown in the table above.<P>

The premium is payable monthly in advance and collected by Direct Debit.<P>

The premiums are subject to the addition of Insurance Premium Tax at the appropriate rate.<P>

Legal & General may cancel your policy by giving you 30 days written notice to your last known address.<P>

<A NAME="who"></A>
<B>WHO CAN APPLY</B><P>

Anyone with a Northern Rock mortgage, between the ages of 18 and 64 who has been in continuous employment, including self-employment, for the last six months, can take out Payment Protection. Even if you are on holiday or on statutory maternity leave from your employment, you can still apply.<P>

If you decide to remortgage to another Bank or Building Society you can retain your policy to protect the repayments under your new mortgage.<P>

If you are self-employed and become unemployed, you will be covered as long as you can provide Legal & General with evidence that you ceased trading because you couldn't find enough work to meet all your reasonable business and living expenses; and the unemployment is not a normal occurrence of your line of work.<P>

You can apply for Payment Protection insurance at anytime provided you have a Northern Rock mortgage.<P>

There are no special rules about sports and pastimes, but you are not eligible if you live outside the UK, Isle of Man or the Channel Islands, or do not have the right to live here permanently.<P>

You can choose to divide the benefit between both borrowers if you have a joint mortgage and both are eligible to apply for cover. Simply enter the chosen amount of benefit for each person on the Payment Protection application form.<P>

If one of you decides to stop work, just tell us and we'll transfer all the insurance to the remaining salary earner up to a maximum of 200% of the monthly mortgage payment.<P>

Alternatively, Payment Protection can be taken out in the name of the one person only.<P>

<A NAME="next"></A>
<B>THE NEXT STEP</B><P>

To apply for Payment Protection, simply fill in the application and Direct Debit forms and send them to Northern Rock Insurance.<P>

Cover will usually start from the completion date of your mortgage or when your application is accepted by Legal & General. Then no matter how dark the clouds become, there will always be a silver lining.<P>

Remember, the first 6 months are free.<P>

<A NAME="exclusions"></A>
<B>WHAT ARE THE EXCLUSIONS?</B><P>

The main exclusions are as follows:<P>

<UL>
<LI>No benefit will be payable if you become unemployed within 60 days of the start of the policy (120 days if you take a policy out at any time other than when applying for a new mortgage, re-mortgage or further advance).
<LI>The first 60 days of each period of disability or unemployment. 
<LI>Any disability or illnes which you already have (whether diagnosed or not) or have received treatment for during the 12 months before the policy's start date.
<LI>Self-inflicted injuries.
<LI>Alcohol or drug-abuse related claims.
<LI>Normal pregnancy
<LI>War and similar risks.
<LI>Unemployment which you know is about to happen at the time you take out cover.
<LI>Unemployment after the end of a fixed term contract, a contract for a specific task or a period of training or apprenticeship.
<LI>Unemployment after a period of casual, temporary or occasional work.
<LI>Voluntary unemployment, resignation or voluntary redundancy. Please note that the above is not an exhaustive list of the terms and conditions of cover. Full details are available in the Policy Document which will be sent to you 
if you take out a Payment Protection policy. We will be happy to send you a specimen Policy Document.
</UL><P>

<A NAME="claim"></A>
<B>HOW TO MAKE A CLAIM</B><P>

Simply call our helpline for a claim form then fill it in and send it back with the necessary supporting documents as evidence.<P>

We know that at times like this, the last thing you need is a lot of red tape. You'll find the procedures quick and efficient, our staff helpful and sympathetic.<P>

Northern Rock and Legal & General have introduced a telephone advice service for all Payment Protection policy holders faced with unemployment. It's called 'LifeTrack' and is operated by Working Transitions Limited, an independent, specialist unemployment consultancy. This excellent service is offered completely free of charge to those customers with unemployment cover.<P>

<A NAME="service"></A>
<B>CUSTOMER SERVICE</B><P>

Legal & General care about the service provided to you, and make every effort to keep standards as high as possible. If they let you down, or you are not satisfied in some way, they want to know.<P>

If you have a complaint, follow the guidelines below and we will deal with it in the best possible way.<P>

<OL>
<LI>Write to the Claims Manager, Legal & General Insurance Services, PO Box 91, A1 Barnet Way, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire WD6 2UN.<BR>
Telephone: 0845 200 8791.<P>

<LI>If you are still not satisfied write to:<BR>
The Managing Director, Legal & General Insurance Limited, Temple Court, 11 Queen Victoria Street, London EC4N 4TP.<BR>
Telephone 020 7528 6200 who will make sure that your case is examined.<P>

Should the above fail to resolve the issue, you may refer the dispute to the Insurance Ombudsman - but only if you have already referred the matter to Legal & General. The address is:<BR>
Financial Ombudsman's Service, South Quay Plaza 2, 183 Marsh Wall, Docklands, London E14 9SR.<BR>
Telephone: 0845 600 6666.<BR>
The FOS will handle most complaints which you may have concerning your personal insurance policy.
</OL><P>

However there are a few instances which fall outside its authority. Contacting the Financial Ombudsman Service will not affect your right to take legal action.<P>

<A NAME="important"></A>
<B>SOME IMPORTANT POINTS</B><P>

You should make sure your amount of cover is adequate, because you can't increase the amount at the time of the claim.<P>

You can review cover whenever your mortgage payment changes, e.g. at the end of a discounted or fixed rate term, subject to acceptance by the insurer and a 60 day waiting period.<P>

DSS benefit rules can change, and the presence of a Payment Protection policy may influence benefit entitlement in individual circumstances.<P>

If you are not entirely satisfied with your Payment Protection policy you can cancel the cover within 30 days of receiving it. If you have not made a claim under your Payment Protection policy during those 30 days, we will cancel the Plan and refund any premium you have paid.<P>

If you wish cover to continue after the claim, premiums will need to be paid throughout the claim period. If payment is not continued your policy cannot be reinstated after the claim period.<P>

All Cover and monthly benefit payments under this policy will end when:<P>

<UL>
<LI>you reach 65.
<LI>you retire from employment.
<LI>the only remaining obligation you have under the agreement is to pay the lender a fee for holding your title deeds in safe custody.
<LI>you let your property - (you must advise Northern Rock).
</UL><P>

All insurance will end:<P>

<UL>
<LI>with immediate effect in respect of fraud.
<LI>when we send 30 days written notice of cancellation and offer an alternative insurance scheme. 
<LI>when we send 90 days written notice of cancellation. 
<LI>when you send 30 days written notice of cancellation. 
</UL><P>

You must ask Legal & General to cancel your Plan from the date that the first of these events occurs.<P>

<A NAME="choice"></A>
<B>CHOICE OF LAW</B><P>
