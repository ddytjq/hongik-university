<span class="textbd">Introduction</span><br>
When the International Space Station is completed, around 2006, it will no doubt be the largest and most complex international scientific project in history Following on from Skylab and Mir, the station will represent a move of unprecedented scale off the home planet. The United States are leading an international team of 16 Nations (Canada, Japan, Russia, the 11 nations of the European Space Agency and Brazil) drawing upon great scientific and technological resources in the construction of the ISS. 
</p>
<p>
The ISS, being four times larger than Mir (the (former) Russian space station) will, when completed, have a mass of about 472,730kg. It will measure 106.8m across and 87m long, with almost an acre of solar panels to provide electrical power to six laboratories.
</p>
<img src="../images/iss2.jpg" alt="ISS" width="120" height="100"><br><br>
<p>
The International Space Station will be in an orbit with an altitude of 402km with an inclination of 51.6 &deg;. This orbit allows for easy accessibility for crews and supplies (ferried aboard the launch vehicles of all the international participants) to the space station. The orbit affords the station's inhabitants with excellent views of the Earth with coverage of 85 percent of the globe.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">ISS Phase One: The Shuttle-Mir Program</span><br>
The first phase of the International Space Station, the Shuttle-Mir Program, began in 1995 and involved more than two years of continuous stays by astronauts aboard the Russian Mir Space Station and nine Shuttle-Mir docking missions. Valuable knowledge was gained in technology, international space operations and scientific research.
</p>
<img src="../images/iss3.jpg" alt="ISS" width="120" height="100"><br><br>
<p>
Seven U.S. astronauts spent a cumulative total of 32 months aboard Mir with 28 months of continuous occupancy since March 1996. By contrast, it took the U.S. Space Shuttle fleet more than a dozen years and 60 flights to achieve an accumulated one year in orbit. Many of the research programs planned for the International Space Station benefit from longer stay times in space. The U.S. science program aboard Mir was a pathfinder for more ambitious experiments planned for the new station. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">Research on the International Space Station</span><br>
The International Space Station will establish an unprecedented state-of-the-art laboratory complex in orbit, more than four times the size and with almost 60 times the electrical power for experiments of Mir. Research in the station's six laboratories will hopefully lead to discoveries in medicine, materials and fundamental science that will benefit people all over the world. The station also will serve as an indispensable step in preparation for future human space exploration.
</p>
<img src="../images/iss4.jpg" alt="ISS" width="120" height="100"><br><br>
<p>
<span class="textbd">Examples of the types of research that will be performed aboard the station include:</span><br><br>
<span class="textbd">· Protein crystal studies:</span><br>More pure protein crystals may be grown in space than on Earth. Analysis of these crystals helps scientists better understand the nature of proteins, enzymes and viruses, perhaps leading to the development of new drugs and a better understanding of the fundamental building blocks of life. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">· Life in low gravity:</span><br>The effects of long-term exposure to reduced gravity on humans will be studied aboard the station. Studies of these effects may lead to a better understanding of the body’s systems and similar ailments on Earth. A thorough understanding of such effects and possible methods of counteracting them is needed to prepare for future long-term human exploration of the solar system. In addition, studies of the gravitational effects on plants, animals and the function of living cells will be conducted aboard the station. A centrifuge, located in the Centrifuge Accommodation Module, will use centrifugal force to generate simulated gravity ranging from almost zero to twice that of Earth. This facility will imitate Earth’s gravity for comparison purposes; eliminate variables in experiments; and simulate the gravity on the Moon or Mars for experiments that can provide information useful for future space travels.
</p>
<img src="../images/iss5.jpg" alt="ISS" width="120" height="100"><br><br>
<p>
<span class="textbd">· The nature of space:</span><br>Some experiments aboard the station will take place on the exterior of the station modules. Such exterior experiments can study the space environment and how long-term exposure to space, the vacuum and the debris, affects materials. This research can provide future spacecraft designers and scientists a better understanding of the nature of space and enhance spacecraft design. Some experiments will study the basic forces of nature, a field called Fundamental Physics, where experiments take advantage of weightlessness to study forces that are weak and difficult to study when subject to gravity on Earth. Experiments in this field may help explain how the universe developed. Investigations that use lasers to cool atoms to near absolute zero may help us understand gravity itself. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">· Watching the Earth:</span><br>Observations of the Earth from orbit help the study of large-scale, long-term changes in the environment. Studies in this field can increase understanding of the forests, oceans and mountains. The effects of volcanoes, ancient meteorite impacts, hurricanes and typhoons can be studied. In addition, changes to the Earth that are caused by the human race can be observed. The effects of air pollution, such as smog over cities; of deforestation and of water pollution are visible from space and can be captured in images that provide a global perspective unavailable from the ground.
</p>

<p>
<span class="textbd">Assembly in Orbit</span><br>

By the end of this year, most of the components required for the first seven Space Shuttle missions to assemble the International Space Station will have arrived at the Kennedy Space Center. 
</p>
<p>
Orbital assembly of the ISS will begin a new era of hands-on work in space, involving more spacewalks than ever before and a new generation of space robotics. About 850 clock hours of spacewalks, both U.S. and Russian, will be required over five years to maintain and assemble the station. The Space Shuttle and two types of Russian launch vehicles will launch 45 assembly missions. Of these, 36 will be Space Shuttle flights. In addition, resupply missions and changeouts of Soyuz crew return spacecraft will be launched regularly. Assembly is planned to be complete by 2006.
