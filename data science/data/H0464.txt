Reading Sequence Logos

Information theory was introduced in the late 1940s by
Claude Shannon
for the study of communications systems[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Sloane.Wyner1993">1</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#Pierce1980">2</A>].
With this mathematical tool,
information passing
through a telephone or computer data line
can be measured
and compared to the
theoretical limit of the line, called the channel capacity.
The information
measure is given in units of bits per second, where one bit
is the choice between two equally likely possibilities.
Surprisingly, one of Shannon's theorems states that as long
as the channel capacity is not exceeded, the
communications may have as few errors as desired[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Shannon1949">3</A>].
An example of the practical use of this result is the clear
music of compact discs (CDs) which are specially coded
to protect against noise.
Cleaning instructions for CDs say that they should be wiped
in a radial direction.  If any scratches are introduced,
they will have less effect on the coding, which runs
in concentric circles and is capable of correcting up to 4000
data bit errors[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Immink1991">4</A>].

<P>
Evolutionary conservation indicates the functional
importance of biological structures,
so a robust and precise
measure for conservation is necessary for empirical studies.
The measurement of conservation in bits is uniquely suited
to this task because, unlike any other measure,
bits are additive and consistent from one system to the next.
Bits provide a universal scale for measuring
biological conservation not only in DNA and RNA but also
for proteins and other macromolecules[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Schneider1986">5</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#Stormo1991b">6</A>].

<P>
OxyR is a tetrameric protein that binds to the DNA of several
promoters in <EM>Escherichia coli</EM> and activates transcription
of genes encoding
antioxidant enzymes[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Tartaglia1992">7</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#Storz.Tartaglia1992">8</A>].
The initial investigation of the DNA-binding sites by
Tartaglia <EM>et al.</EM> showed that OxyR
binds to a large region of DNA, but the consensus sequences
obtained were weak and sparse, making the sites difficult to
characterize.

<P>
In conjunction
with the information analysis described here,
recent experimental work on this protein[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Toledano1994">9</A>]
clarified the way in which OxyR binds to DNA sequences.
This would not have been possible using a consensus sequence.

The sequence logos[<A

 HREF="node1.html#Papp.helixrepa">11</A>]
in Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.oxyr">2</A>
summarize the data in a set of aligned
sequences such as
Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.oxyr.alist">1</A>.
The height of a stack of letters is the sequence conservation measured
in bits of information according to equation (<A HREF="paper.html#eqn.rsequencel">1</A>).
The height of each letter within a stack is proportional to its
frequency at that position in the binding site.
The letters are sorted, with the most frequent on top.
The cosine wave represents the
twist of B-form DNA.  Wave peaks are all on one face of the DNA and represent
the major groove facing the protein.
Error bars indicate the variability of a comparable number of
random sequences[<A

<EM>Analysis of OxyR Sequence Logos for DNA Binding Face</EM>

<P>
Wild-type OxyR binding site sequences
were aligned
(Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.oxyr.alist">1</A>)
and information analysis was used to generate the
sequence logo in Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.oxyr">2</A>a.
The logo
shows a correlation between the strongest sequence conservation,
as given by the heights of the stacks of letters,
and the face of B-form DNA, as given by the cosine wave.
The same correlation is seen in
other proteins
(<IMG

and
LexA,
see figure 6 of Papp <EM>et al.</EM>[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Papp.helixrepa">11</A>]).
The extent of DNase I footprinting[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Tartaglia1992">7</A>]
and this correlation
suggests that OxyR binds to one face of B-form DNA
in 4 successive major grooves.

<P>
A second line of evidence that can be read from the sequence logo
also supports this model.
When a protein is in contact with a major groove,
the two base pairs and their two orientations
can be distinguished,
as recognized by Seeman
<EM>et al</EM>[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Seeman1976">17</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#Papp.helixrepa">11</A>],
so the protein is capable of ``choosing''
one of the four possibilities:
A=T,
T=A,
C<IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.gif"
 ALT="$\equiv$">G,
or
G<IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.gif"
 ALT="$\equiv$">C.
This can be explained with the help of
Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.dna">3</A>,
which depicts the two base pairs.
The possible chemical contacts for T=A
in the major groove are (reading from left to right):
methyl group,
hydrogen acceptor,
hydrogen donor
and
hydrogen acceptor,
or
T:Me-a-d-a:A for short.
This can easily be distinguished from the
complementary pattern of
A=T, which is A:a-d-a-Me:T.  Likewise
C:(blank)-d-a-a:G
is distinguishable from
G:a-a-d-(blank):C.
Finally, GC/CG can be distinguished from AT/TA.

<P>
This choice of 1 possibility in 4 can be made
with 2 bits of information.
(This is calculated as 
<!-- MATH: $\log_2 4/1 = 2$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="102" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$\log_2 4/1 = 2$">
bits.
For further explanation, see Pierce[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Pierce1980">2</A>] or
the primer on information theory whose location is given in
Materials and Methods.)
Completely conserved
positions in the major groove are described by 2 bits
and this is the highest point on the vertical scale of the sequence logos.
It is easiest to think of a bit as a knife slice that dissects
the bases in
Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.dna">3</A>.
A horizontal slice is the first bit and a vertical slice is the second one.
The first bit determines whether the base is
above or below the slice
and the second bit determines whether
it is to the left or the right.
Because they are at right angles to one another,
the slices provide independent choices
and no more than 2 bits are needed to specify a single base.
For example, ``top, left'' selects the T.
The average number of bits needed to describe the observed
frequency of bases is the information content
or sequence conservation.
Because it is an average it does not need to be an integer
and
so the heights of the letter stacks in the sequence logo are real
numbers.
Sequence conservation in the major groove can range anywhere between
0 and 2 bits depending on the strength of the contacts involved,
as seen in figure 6 of Papp <EM>et al.</EM>[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Papp.helixrepa">11</A>].
Just because it is <EM>possible</EM> for sequence conservation
to be as high as 2 bits from the major groove does not mean that the
protein <EM>will</EM>  evolve to that high a value.
The important factors are the total sequence conservation[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Schneider1986">5</A>]
and the
coding of the binding site that distinguishes it from other sequences.

<P>
In contrast to the major groove,
contacts in the minor groove of B-form DNA allow both orientations of each kind
of base pair so that
rotations about the dyad axis cannot easily be distinguished.
This is because
from the minor groove
C<IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.gif"
 ALT="$\equiv$">G
appears nearly identical to
G<IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.gif"
 ALT="$\equiv$">C
and
A=T
appears identical to
T=A.
Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.dna">3</A> shows that
C<IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.gif"
 ALT="$\equiv$">G in the minor groove
has the chemical moiety pattern
a-d-a,
which is, to a good first approximation,
identical to the pattern of the complementary orientation.
The hydrogen donor N2 of G
is almost exactly on the dyad axis (the dashed line) and
so its position does not change much in the complement.  Hydrogen atoms held in
a hydrogen bond vibrate vigorously and probably make such a fine
positional
distinction difficult because they vibrate almost independently
of the donor and acceptor[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Kearley1994">18</A>].
The base pair
A=T
has
a-(blank)-a,
which is
identical in the other orientation.
So A=T can be distinguished from C<IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.gif"
 ALT="$\equiv$">G in the minor groove
only by a donor contact to the N2 or by a physical probe which
blocks the N2 (in the blank at the black dot).
Because both of these are close to the dyad axis
only the horizontal knife slice works for the minor groove.

<P>
Because
only 2 of the 4 possibilities can be distinguished,
when a B-form minor groove is probed by a protein no more
than 1 bit of information (
<!-- MATH: $\log_2 4/2 = 1$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="102" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$\log_2 4/2 = 1$">
bit) can be obtained.
That is, positions with more than 1 bit of information
are likely to represent major grooves facing the protein
or, if they do represent minor groove contacts,
then the DNA is probably not B-form[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Papp.helixrepa">11</A>].
In the OxyR sequence logo, positions <IMG
 WIDTH="29" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img10.gif"
 ALT="$\pm 4$">,
<IMG
 WIDTH="29" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$\pm 5$">
and <IMG
 WIDTH="29" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img12.gif"
 ALT="$\pm 7$">are conserved by more than 1 bit of information, so
these positions probably represent major grooves facing the protein.
This is consistent with the correlation between sequence conservation
and the face of the DNA discussed earlier.

<P>
After this prediction was made, it was confirmed by hydroxyl radical
footprinting and missing base experiments[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Toledano1994">9</A>].

<P>
<BR>
<BR>

<EM>Prediction of Specific OxyR DNA Contacts
by ``Reading'' the Sequence Logo</EM>

<P>
Because position 0 in the wild-type sequence logo
shows equally likely A and T (Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.oxyr">2</A>a),
that position may represent a contact from OxyR which
collides with the minor groove N2 of G (ref.[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Seeman1976">17</A>]),
allowing only
A=T
and
T=A,
and disallowing
C<IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.gif"
 ALT="$\equiv$">G entirely.
This prediction was supported by methylation interference data
which indicate that methylation at N3 of A blocks binding
(Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.oxyr">2</A>a).

<P>
The logo also shows that
positions +4, +7 and +13 are predominantly
either A or G
(T or C at the negative coordinates), which suggests a contact by OxyR to the
major groove N7 group because only the N7 acceptor is
conserved in an A
<!-- MATH: $\leftrightarrow$ -->

This is also confirmed by methylation interference data, but
the disproportionate frequencies of these bases suggests that other
contacts or effects are also involved.

<P>
Position -15 is mostly T or G (A or C at +15),
suggesting a weak contact to the
major groove A-N6 or C-N4 and/or T-O4 and G-O6 groups.
These contacts could be conserved in

This kind of contact
is likely to be at position -6 (and +7) of CRP sites[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Papp.helixrepa">11</A>],
where the crystal structure shows that
Arg<SUP>180</SUP> donates hydrogen bonds to O6 and N7 of

 HREF="node1.html#Zhang.Ebright1990">21</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#Schultz1991">19</A>].
Apparently when G is replaced by T in a CRP site, the T-O4 contact
is used instead of G-O6, but the G-N7 contact is lost.
This accounts for the binding order
except for the A.
Substitution by A would break the G-O6 contact
but would maintain the N7 contact.
The binding order
T &gt; A
suggests that
the O4 contact is stronger than the N7 contact[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Jansen1987">20</A>],
even though when T
<!-- MATH: $\rightarrow$ -->

the O4/O6 contact shifts by

<IMG
 WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img15.gif"
 ALT="$\sim \! \! \! 1$">&#197; whereas
the N7 contact does not move at all.

<P>
Other positions in the OxyR binding sites
show methylation interference that do not have apparent
correlation to the observed sequence conservation.
This could be because the sequence conservation was derived from
only a few sequences and so is noisy, as indicated by the large error bars.
Alternatively, OxyR may pass close to the DNA at some points but not
make actual contact unless the DNA is abnormally methylated.
Other effects, such as DNA bending or twisting,
also might account for these discrepancies.

<P>
A more subtle piece of evidence can be found in the overall shape
of the sequence logo.
Notice how the stack heights at positions
-4, -5, and -7follow along under the cosine wave
(Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.oxyr">2</A>a).
This effect can be observed in other sequence logos,
in particular

It can be explained by the geometry of a globular protein approaching
the cylindrical DNA.
During the process of finding the binding sites the protein
moves toward and away from the DNA[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Weber1984a">22</A>].
Contacts at the center of the DNA cylinder are closest to the protein
and so should be the easiest to evolve.
Contacts become progressively more difficult to make
as the
approach is made further off axis
(Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.dnacyl">4</A>).
If one were to rotate a DNA molecule
on its long axis, a point on its surface
would cycle between being visible and not visible.
This naturally results in a cosine function of accessibility
along a linear DNA molecule.
If we define accessibility as
a cosine function that runs from 0 to 1 bit in the minor groove
and
another cosine function that runs
from 0 to 2 bits in the major groove,
then the sum of these two functions is the cosine wave drawn on the logo.
The correlation between sequence conservation
and accessibility is
consistent with the proposal that
positions

<EM>Analysis of Synthetic OxyR Binding Sites</EM>

<P>
A ``randomization''
experiment[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Schneider1989">23</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#Papp.helixrepa">11</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#Barrick.ribosomes1994">24</A>]
was performed
in which OxyR protein was used to gel shift 30 base pair
equi-probable random sequences[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Toledano1994">9</A>].
Unfortunately this gave a dismal logo (Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.oxyr">2</A>b), possibly because
the protein was prevented from binding properly by the
flanking constant
sequence of the vector.
The high conservation at the ends (<IMG
 WIDTH="38" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img21.gif"
 ALT="$\pm 14$">
and <IMG
 WIDTH="38" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

comes more from one side of the cloning
sites and so may represent an
artifact.
<A NAME="tex2html9"
 HREF="footnode.html#foot274"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
Still, some correlation with Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.oxyr">2</A>a is visible in the logo,
in particular the A preference at <IMG
 WIDTH="29" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$\pm 4$">,
the T preference at <IMG

and
the G preference at <IMG
 WIDTH="29" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img12.gif"
 ALT="$\pm 7$">.
But other positions are just as conserved and do not reflect the wild-type
sequences.

<P>
To clarify this situation,
the randomization experiment was repeated with 45 base pair
equi-probable random sequences which were then aligned by an information theory
technique using the malign.p program (Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.oxyr">2</A>c)[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Toledano1994">9</A>].
Only some of the patterns evident in Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.oxyr">2</A>a
were confirmed by this experiment,
whereas others became more predominant.
The T or C at position <IMG
 WIDTH="29" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

closely reflects
the wild-type sequences there (7 Cs, 5 Ts, 1 G, 1 A).

The reason for these quantitative
discrepancies between the wild-type
sequence logo and the logo from experimentally selected sites is unknown,
but might be accounted for by the small sample sizes.

<P>
Another difficulty with this kind of experiment is that it always
contains at least one unknown parameter, the stringency of selection.
If the concentration of OxyR protein
were large, then its non-specific binding should cause more DNA
sequences to shift in the gel.  This would lead to a sequence
logo with a low information content relative to the natural
sequences.  However,
a low concentration of OxyR protein should lead to a
much higher measured information content, perhaps higher than
is naturally found.
This is also a danger
in amplification protocols such as SELEX[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Tuerk1990b">25</A>].

<P>
To counter this,
the protein concentration could be adjusted
so that the total information content from the randomization experiment
matches that of the natural sequences.  Presumably the two logos
would then look the same.
Were they the same for the experiment that was done?
The area under the
logo (
<!-- MATH: $R_{sequence}$ -->
<I>R</I><SUB><I>sequence</I></SUB>) was 
<!-- MATH: $15.4 \pm 1.9$ -->

sequences and their complements
(Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.oxyr">2</A>A)
but was

bits
for the 16 sequences and their complements in the 45mer experiment
(Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.oxyr">2</A>C).
These can be compared by a two-tailed Student's t test[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Press1989">16</A>].
Because both the sequences and their complements were used,
the two halves of the sequence logo are not independent and the test
must be done with half-sites.
This reduces each mean by a factor of 2 and reduces
the variance by a factor of 2 so the standard deviations reduce by
<IMG
 WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="42" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img34.gif"
 ALT="$\sqrt{2}$">.
The number of samples in the half-site set
remains at 14 and 32 respectively.
The t test on the half-sites shows that
the natural sites are significantly different
in information content from the experimental set
(<I>t</I>=2.7 with 44 degrees of freedom, <I>p</I> &lt; 0.02).
Unfortunately this criterion for matching the wild-type binding
sites was not met.

<P>
Even so, it is clear that
the
sequence conservation is not
uniformly proportional across the two logos.
One possibility that might account for the observed
conservation at the edges of the experimentally derived sites
is that OxyR is still affected by the constant flanking
sequences of the cloning vector
and binds to one or the other side in some cases.
The discrepancy may also reflect
different conditions between <EM>in vivo</EM> evolutionary
factors and the <EM>in vitro</EM> gel shift experiment.
For example, no spermidine was used in the gel shift
experiment[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Toledano1994">9</A>], yet it is well known that spermidine
is important for precise recognition by other DNA binding
proteins[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Pingoud1985">26</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#Wan.Wilkins1993">27</A>].
Comparison of the wild-type sequence logo to a series of
random gel shift sequence logos might be used to determine
precisely what the <EM>in vivo</EM> binding conditions are.

<P>
<BR>
<BR>

<EM>Usefulness of Sequence Logos Versus Consensus Sequences</EM>

<P>
The case of OxyR demonstrates the usefulness of sequence logos
as a replacement for consensus sequences.
The pattern bound by the protein is
difficult to detect by eye (Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="paper.html#fig.oxyr.alist">1</A>),
and no agreement could be found for
a consensus sequence.  In contrast, the sequence logos
are created automatically and without any ambiguity.
They show clear and easily interpretable patterns.
Because information theory is quantitative, statistical
tests can be applied to collections of binding site sequences.

<P>
A consensus replaces the natural frequencies of bases with
arbitrarily chosen ones [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Stormo1990">28</A>].
For example, in our data set[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Papp.helixrepa">11</A>],
CRP position -6has
2 As,
2 Cs,
44 Gs
and
10 Ts.
Taking the consensus alters this to 100% G and 0% of the other bases.
When the consensus sequence G was chosen by this method,
a subtle pattern of sequence conservation was
lost[<A
 HREF="node1.html#deCrombrugghe1984">29</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#Ebright1984">30</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#Weber1984b">31</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#Ebright1984b">32</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#
Jansen1987"></A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#Gent1987b">33</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#Zhang.Ebright1990">21</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#Schultz1991">19</A>].
That the T contact occurs naturally apparently went unrecognized
until the present work, although the mechanism of the contact
was already understood from mutations[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Jansen1987">20</A>].

<P>
The art of predicting specific base contacts is well
known[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Seeman1976">17</A>] but the pervasive use of consensus
sequences in the modern molecular biology literature
has prevented full use of the available sequence data.
In the case of CRP discussed earlier, the subtle
G to T switch, which probably
destroys one hydrogen bond while keeping the
other, was missed because only the G was retained
in the consensus model.
In contrast, because it visually displays
the relevant information in a compact, quantitative form,
the sequence logo allows direct interpretation
of the data and leads to specific predictions that can guide
experimentation.
Further, when anomalies appear, the logo displays them
so blatantly that new phenomena are revealed[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Papp.helixrepa">11</A>].
Even correlations between positions in a binding
site[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Stephens.Schneider.Splice">15</A>]
could be presented in a three-dimensional sequence logo,
but software to generate this display has not been written yet.

<P>
As seen by the sequence logo, OxyR does not have a special
kind of binding site as has been suggested[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Tartaglia1992">7</A>].
OxyR merely happens to have a long binding site with low overall
information content,
so it tends to have
low sequence conservation per position.
As a consequence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics,
DNA-protein
contacts tend to spread out over the available surface
on an evolutionary time scale.
With at least 4 major grooves and three minor grooves to make contacts in,
OxyR can ``afford'' to have many small contacts.
Paradoxically, a mathematically rigorous theorem shows
that having many small contacts like those used
by OxyR can <EM>improve</EM>
sequence discrimination[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Schneider.nano2">34</A>].
Furthermore, many binding sites are like OxyR in that they
have variations in their information content
at different positions.
This is immediately apparent upon inspection
of splice junction sequence logos[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Stephens.Schneider.Splice">15</A>]
and the ``gallery'' of DNA recognition sequence logos[<A
 HREF="node1.html#Papp.helixrepa">11</A>].

<P>
The arbitrary and artificial distinctions between strong and weak binding sites,
between the ``core'' and the periphery of a site
and between the inside and outside of binding site ``boxes''
that have been fostered by the use of consensus sequences
are eliminated when one adopts the concept that sequence
conservation is a real number that can
be measured precisely in bits of information.

<P>
<BR>
<BR>

<B>Summary</B>

<P>
DNA sequences to which the OxyR protein binds under oxidizing
conditions were analyzed by the sequence logo method, a
quantitative graphic technique based on information theory.
A sequence logo shows both the sequence conservation
and the frequencies of bases at each
position in a site.
Unlike the consensus sequence,
the sequence logo analysis revealed that
OxyR should bind to four major grooves of DNA.
This was later confirmed by experiments.
Detailed interpretation of the sequence logo also allowed
the prediction of likely major and minor groove
OxyR-DNA base contacts, consistent with
available experimental results.
Because the sequence logo shows
the original base frequencies
in a clear, easily interpreted graphic
that does not distort the data,
highly refined analysis of binding site contacts becomes easy.
Not only can these methods be applied to any DNA sequence binding site,
they can also be applied to sites on RNA and proteins.
