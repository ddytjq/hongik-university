  In the summer of the year 2001, the England Members Club (EMC) was scraped to
  make way for the new club called englandfans.&nbsp; Every member of the
  existing club was sent a survey asking them how the new club should be
  run.&nbsp; The FA then put all the surveys in the bin and ignored the
  supporters wants completely.&nbsp; At the moment there are roughly 20,000
  members who have each paid £20.00 making a sum of £400.000 - not bad for a
  non-profit making club.&nbsp; As far as I'm concerned, this money should be
  used solely for the allocation and distribution of tickets, yet achieving this
  in a satisfactory way seems to be beyond them.</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Under the EMC, each member received one &quot;loyalty point&quot; for every competitive
  home game that they attended, two points for a home friendly and three points
  for any away matches they went to.&nbsp; Postal applications were accepted
  about six months before matches and any oversubscribed matches (either home or
  away) were dealt with using the loyalty point system.&nbsp; This way of
  allocating tickets was fair, simple and was rarely contested by supporters of
  our nations football team.&nbsp; In April of 1999, each member was sent an
  application form for the home match in November of that year, at the time
  England had not qualified for Euro2000 and were in danger of not making the
  play-offs.&nbsp; The home match we were applying for could have been a
  friendly against any team in the world, or a play-off fixture and members
  applied (and paid for) tickets anyway.&nbsp; Once it was decided that the
  match would be a play-off against Scotland, everybody wanted a ticket but at
  least EMC members would not have to join the mayhem on the telephone
  hotlines!&nbsp; In 2001, the same situation arose, but this time England had
  secured qualification and the match would be a friendly against Sweden.&nbsp;
  Englandfans were given no priority whatsoever and had to scramble on the phone
  lines trying to ring ticketmaster with everybody else - what a joke.</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  On a side note, traveling from Manchester to Wembley for a friendly on a
  winters night was made worth while because of the loyalty point system.&nbsp;
  Of course London supporters had it much easier to gain points than ourselves
  be we didn't mind because as soon as Wembley is rebuilt the team will be
  playing at grounds up and down the country and it will be fair for
  everyone...... How can the FA justify giving an England fan from the South
  East a &quot;cap&quot; for attending the match in Paris on a Saturday night in
  September 2000 whilst ignoring a supporter from Newcastle who travels to
  Wembley on a Wednesday night for a friendly against Ukraine?</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Instead of the tried and tested system, the powers that be have made the new
  club for away fans only and members are allocated a &quot;cap&quot; for any
  away games that they attend.&nbsp; The FA's official allocation is then split
  and 70% of tickets go to those fans with the most &quot;caps&quot; while the
  remaining 30%&nbsp; will go to a ballot for any members - regardless of how
  long they have been a member or how many matches that have previously
  attended.&nbsp; An example of how pathetic this is can be demonstrated by the
  way this years World Cup tickets are allocated.&nbsp; If a supporter has not
  missed a home match for ten years and went away with the team to all four
  qualifying matches (Albania, Finland, Greece &amp; Germany) he (or she) would
  not be guaranteed a ticket for any world cup match and would instead be in the
  30% ballot with members who have just joined for tickets for Japan, is that
  fair?</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  I understand that the club want to attract a new breed of supporter (i.e. more
  women and children) to help combat the hooligan problem, but they are going
  about it all wrong.&nbsp; This &quot;new breed&quot; will be quite happy
  whilst England are in the World Cup and have celebrity players such as Beckham
  and Owen in the team but what happens next?&nbsp; If the team has a miserable
  World Cup and then fails to qualify for Portugal 2004, will the
  Jonny-Come_Latelys remain loyal?&nbsp; I remember sitting at Wembley in
  November 1995 for a friendly against Switzerland with the stadium barely a
  quarter full, where were these so called supporters then?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  I know that there is no easy solution and you can't please everybody all the
  time but I believe that the current system pleases fewer people than the
  previous EMC did.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">How
  about this system for a home match at Pride Park, Derby. capacity 30,000 :-</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 0; line-height: 100%; word-spacing: 0; margin-left: 10; margin-right: 10; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Take
  away the football family (8,000), sponsors (3,000) and away supporters (10% =
  3,000) to leave a saleable total of 16,000 (all figures are approx and I have
  used the smallest stadium that England have played in recently)&nbsp; Half of
  that total (8,000) could go to englandfans using the loyalty scheme (3 for
  away game, 2 for a home friendly and 1 for a home competitive match) and the
  other half (8,000) could go to the general public to encourage new supporters.&nbsp;
  Away matches would all be decided by using the loyalty points system.&nbsp;
  Simple, but don't hold your breath.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  Anyway, Don't let us put you off joining, if you fancy spending £20.00 for a
  free web-page (???), paying for the &quot;Raise The Flag&quot; during the
  National Anthems, James Worrells wages and the England Spongers tickets (also
  known as the band) then contact the FA at <a href="http://www.the-fa.org/englandfans">www.the-fa.org/englandfans</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
