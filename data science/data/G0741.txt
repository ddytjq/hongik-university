<P><B>2.1  Morphological Classification of Collisional Forms</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The short answer to the question above is - a tremendous variety of
forms.  This is perhaps the place for the reader to put down this article and
peruse the Arp or Arp-Madore atlas for an hour or so, if he/she has not done
so before!  These galaxies would not have been tossed into the
&quot;peculiars&quot; bin if they could have been fitted into simple scheme
like the Hubble classification.  On the other hand, the instinct to classify
and order is strong, and all of the major collectors of images of these
systems - Zwicky, Verontsov-Velyaminov, Arp, Madore - developed some
phenomenological system.  For example, Arp (1966) arranged his 338 atlas
galaxies into 37 descriptive catagories.  Arp and Madore (1987) used 24
similar, but simplified catagories.  Vorontsov-Velyaminov (1977) has a longer
list of descripters.  Many of the terms used in these atlases, along with a
number of other anecdotal descriptions, are now used commonly, but in no
uniform way.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Schweizer (1990) has proposed a simple, elegant alternative.  If the
Hubble sequence from early-type ellipticals to late-type spirals is like a
continuum line, then Schweizer's classification of collisional galaxies
consists of the plane of Cartesian pairs of progenitor galaxies.  Basically,
he uses a simplified Hubble sequence of three types: ellipticals E, disk
galaxies D, and gas-rich irregulars G.  Given the difficulty in determining
the detailed nature of the progenitors in many cases, this simplification
seems imminently justified.  Schweizer also adopts a clever device - upper
case letters to indicate the large or primary galaxies in the system (e.g. DD
to indicate a collision between two comparably sized disk galaxies), and lower
case letter to indicate small companions (e.g. Ed for a collision between a
small disk and a large elliptical).</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Empiricists could object that this scheme is not a direct
classification based only on features that are seen in the (optical) image of
the galaxy.  It requires an inference as to the type of the progenitors. 
Moreover, it assumes that the progenitors had a definite Hubble type, and that
the distortions are mostly the result of the collision.  However, the weight
of the evidence overwhelmingly favors this assumption in most cases.  In
addition, in many cases the classification doesn't depend as much on
interpretation as on the use of other types of data, such as 21 cm
observations of gas content, or kinematical data to detect a disk component.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The advantage of the earlier descriptive systems is that they highlight
the transient morphologies of the ongoing collision, whereas there are many
morphologies within each category of Schweizer's scheme.  Some of these
morphologies are very short-lived, and others long-lived (see below), so
(relative) lifetimes are also a natural parameter for classification.  In a
study of color trends among tidal features in interacting systems Schombert et
al. (1990) used a very simple scheme (bridges, tails, mergers) based on this
idea.  Schweizer and Seitzer (1990, 1992) have developed a semiquantitative
system to measure tidal features in isolated (but presumably merged)
ellipticals and S0 galaxies.  Other classification systems have been developed
for specific purposes, but these examples illustrate both the difficulty of
developing an all encompassing system, and the utility of specialized systems.
</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>2.2  Physical Classification?</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Nonetheless, should it not be possible to give a relatively complete
physical characterization (including the nature of the progenitors and the
collision parameters) of any collisional system by comparison to computer
simulations?  In principle this may be true, though there are many practical
difficulties.  Uniqueness theorems apply to the relevant stellar and gas
dynamical equations, if the initial conditions are given with infinite
accuracy.  In practice, uniqueness at practical particle, spatial and velocity
resolutions remains unproven, except in a few specific applications. 
Moreover, the theorem does not apply to two-dimensional projections (onto the
sky) of three-dimensional results.  In many cases this point is a mere
academic quibble - there is no difficulty in distinguishing an Arp-Madore
&quot;Sacred Mushroom&quot; type collisional ring galaxy from a well-developed
merger remnant in either observations or simulations.  However, less extreme
cases are not so clear (see below).  The question of uniqueness is also
evolving as resolution increases in both observational and modeling realms.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;However, even assuming that collisional forms are unique functions of
progenitor orbital and structural parameters, their great multiplicity is a
problem.  Consider this multiplicity from a &quot;first principles&quot;
viewpoint.  The orbital parameters include a couple of angles of attack
specifying the approach direction, and an impact parameter specifying the
closest approach of the two centers.  The amplitude of the collisional effects
depends on the mass ratio of the two galaxies.  Absolute timescales for the
evolution of these effects depend on actual masses, but the actual values are
not important to identifying morphologies, so we only need include the mass
ratio among our parameters for the present.  Most collisions are relatively
quick and impulsive, but the magnitude of the effects does depend on the
relative velocity at closest approach (see e.g. Binney and Tremaine 1987, sec.
7.2, henceforth BT).  Finally, the orientation of the spin axis of each galaxy
disk, relative to the axis of the relative orbit, also effects the outcome. 
This introduces a bare minimum of one more parameter, assuming only one galaxy
has a disk.  (Two orientation angles would obviously be better, but the
primary effects depend on whether the orbit is prograde or retrograde relative
to the disk spin.)  Thus, we have a total of 6 or more orbital parameters.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Next we must consider structural parameters.  The most important of
these are the mass ratios of different components, e.g. bulge/disk/stellar
bar/halo.  The gas fraction in the disk is also important.  The scale length
of the various components, or relative compactness, is another important
parameter.  There are many other structural parameters, e.g. the velocity
dispersions (or temperatures) of the various components, or their density
profiles.  Velocity dispersion is probably not independent of the other
parameters, in fact, masses and scale lengths may not be independent. 
Moreover, the density profiles may be sufficiently universal that they can be
omitted as a parameter.  Nonetheless, we have a minimum of about 7 structural
parameters.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;We see that, if we consider a minimal grid of models, with say, 10
values for each parameter, we would need of order 10<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>13
</FONT></SUP> computational runs.  Then, of course, time is a crucial
parameter.  Simulations generally show great temporal variations over the
course of e.g. a Gyr. run, so we would probably want to look at 30 or more
snapshots to represent the whole evolution.  More if we want to see more than
one orthogonal view at each timestep.  This is beginning to make for a very
large family photo album!  We have also been assuming that collisions only
involve two galaxies at a time, but encounters involving three or more
galaxies are probably not uncommon in groups and clusters (see chapters 1, 9).
 Consideration of three body collisions would clearly enormously increase the
number of runs needed for a complete catalog.  It seems that direct physical
classification by reference to a complete numerical atlas with adequate
resolutions is not the way to go.  <B>There are too many possible computer
realizations to assemble a complete atlas of all collisional systems.</B>  
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;This result has a number of nasty corollaries, including - the perfect
computer match to a given system may be lost in an unexplored part of phase
space.  This can be true even if you've already found a &quot;perfect&quot;
match, because uniqueness isn't guaranteed at any given level of resolution. 
Another interesting corollary - a hypothetical computer atlas like that
described above would contain far more snapshots of collisional galaxies than
will be observed on the sky within the foreseeable future.  In fact, since
there are of order 0.01 average galaxies per cubic megaparsec, and the volume
of the observable universe is of order 10<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>11</FONT></SUP> Mpc.
<SUP><FONT SIZE=2>3</FONT></SUP>, it would contain orders of magnitude more
images than there are galaxies in the universe.  All the more so since not all
galaxies are interacting, and we only get one viewing angle of each system.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;These realities certainly influence the choice of problems studied, and
the progress made on these problems.  For example, the multiplicity and
uniqueness appear to significantly complicate studies of collisional shell
galaxies, where observation-simulation comparisons are an intrinsic part of
the research (see sec. 4.3).  They did not have much of a role in early
simulations of mergers (see sec. 4.4), where the basic questions of how long
does merging take, and what is the approximate structure of the remnant, did
not depend on many details.  Now that this research has advanced to a much
higher level of detail (see Hernquist 1993, Barnes 1998), they may be becoming
important.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Nonetheless, the use of distinctive landmark morphologies and common
sense rules make it possible to divide up the parameter space into more
tractible regions.  This judgement seems to be confirmed in the work of Howard
et al. (1993), who actually assembled a quite extensive atlas of N-body
simulations with 86 runs and 1700 snapshots.  (Even so, they had to
incorporate several substantial simplifications, including a rigid, inert
gravitational potential for the companion galaxy and the halo of the primary
galaxy, a two dimensional disk, i.e., not including warps and distortions, and
an extremely approximate treatment of gas dynamics in the disk.)  Howard et
al. discussed a number of generalizations and rules of thumb derived from
these simulations, especially with regard to prograde versus retrograde and
direct (perpendicular) collisions.  Other extensive simulation projects have
been carried out and will be discussed below.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Some very useful insights into the role of the collision parameters
(and into the uniqueness problem) are provided by Gerber and Lamb's (1994)
work.  This paper was primarily a comparison of semi-analytic kinematic models
to fully self-consistent simulations, in the restricted setting of collisions
between a small companion approaching on an orbit nearly perpendicular to the
primary disk, though with a range of impact parameters.  Gerber and Lamb
pointed out that the perturbation in the kinematic models (which were found to
match the simulations well at early times), depended on four dimensionless
parameters.  The first of these is just the time scaling.  Another two are the
dimensionless impact parameter, and a dimensionless measure of the compactness
of the companion.  Finally, there is a strength parameter equal to 2GM
<SUB><FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT></SUB>/(bVv<SUB><FONT SIZE=2>c</FONT></SUB>), where M
<SUB><FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT></SUB> is the mass of the companion, b is the impact
parameter, V is the relative velocity at impact, and v<SUB><FONT SIZE=2>c
</FONT></SUB> is the circular velocity in the primary disk (assuming a flat
rotation curve, i.e. v<SUB><FONT SIZE=2>c</FONT></SUB> = constant).  This
parameter is the velocity disturbance derived from the Impulse Approximation
(see Binney and Tremaine 1987, section 7.2 and references therein), divided by
the disk orbital velocity, which is proportional to the escape velocity. 
Because it was derived for a restricted application, this set of dimensionless
parameters is incomplete, and also some assumptions about the structure of the
two galaxies are embedded in the parameters.  However, it is a very good
example of how to attack a limited part of the problem.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>2.3  The Naming of Things</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;I will conclude this section with an attempt at a classification scheme
that tries to pull together some of the insights from the older morphological
systems as well as those derived from analytic and simulation studies of the
effects of varying collision parameters.  The specific motivation for
attempting this here is to provide simple categories, which highlight the
relationships between and the natural ordering of the many individual cases
discussed in the rest of this article.  The system is essentially a
modification of Schweizer's system, with the addition of a few variables that
are directly related to both the physical quantities characterizing the
collision and to observable characteristics.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Because there are a number of collisional forms that are easily
identifiable as either short-lived or old, the first variable is time.  The
actual development timescale of collisional features depends on the masses of
the galaxies, and galaxy masses can range over at least 6 orders of magnitude.
 Thus, <B>the presence or absence of specific features can only yield relative timescales.
</B>  Age determinations of collision-induced stellar populations might be
more accurate in some cases, especially when a single short starburst
dominates.  (However, in many cases the enhanced star formation may be of long
duration, or there may be multiple bursts.)  But whatever dating technique is
used, for present purposes we limit this variable to three values: young,
intermediate, and old (Y, I, O).</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;In collisions the dynamically cold disks respond the most strongly and
the most quickly to the disturbance, so the relative mass of the disk
component is significant as a first gauge of the magnitude of the collisional
effects.  If there is a substantial disk, the gas fraction in the disk is also
important.  The dynamically cool/hot component ratio and the gas fraction are
related, and related to other quantities (as in the Hubble sequence), so it
suffices to adopt Schweizer's Hubble pairs scheme.  However, I would prefer to
modify his definition of category D to include only early-type disks (S0-Sb),
and of category G to cover all the later Hubble types.  (There is increasing
evidence that most gas-rich galaxies have a rotating disk, and are not
irregular, see e.g., the recent review of Skillman (1996) on dwarf
irregulars.)  </P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;I propose only two variables to describe the collision itself, one for
the magnitude and one for the directionality.  For the former we can use
Gerber and Lamb's dimensionless strength parameter.  As defined, this
parameter is not an observable, but it can be brought closer to observables
with some additional assumptions, which are valid for the most common cases. 
Most collisions probably involve members of bound galaxy groups.  If the mass
of the collisional system is dominated by a dark matter halo encompassing the
whole group, or by the halo of the primary galaxy (e.g. a small companion), it
is reasonable to assume that V <FONT FACE="symbol">&#187;</FONT> v<SUB>
<FONT SIZE=2>c</FONT></SUB> (relative impact velocity approximately equals
circular velocity in primary disk).  Then using the equation of centrifugal
balance in the disk, we can substitute G/v<FONT SIZE=2><SUB>c</SUB><SUP>2
</SUP></FONT> <FONT FACE="symbol">&#187;</FONT> R/M<SUB><FONT SIZE=2>1
</FONT></SUB>, where M<SUB><FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT></SUB> (=M<SUB><FONT SIZE=2>1
</FONT></SUB>(R)) and R are the mass and disk radius of the primary.  Then the
strength parameter becomes,</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;<IMG src="http://arXiv.org/PS_cache/astro-ph/html/9908/9908269/cg.gif" ALT="cg.gif">&#9;&#9;&#9;(1)</P>
<P></P>
<P>The ratio b/R is still not an observable, but in most collisions with
significant effects, its value ranges from a bit less than unity up to of
order a few.  (In head-on collisions b is replaced with an effective
&quot;softening&quot; length.)  Thus, S is roughly equal to a factor of order
unity times the mass ratio M<SUB><FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT></SUB>/M<SUB><FONT SIZE=2>1
</FONT></SUB>, so at a coarse level of description we can use the two
interchangably.  Note: these approximations are not valid for high-velocity
collisions, such as occur in large galaxy clusters.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;In this article a qualitative estimate of S, or just an indication of
whether it is small, medium or large will suffice.  In the latter class are
collisions between nearly equal mass galaxies.  We can define the
&quot;small&quot; class as consisting of collisions with companions of such
low mass that the companion is likely to be disrupted or stripped of
substantial mass, e.g. S &lt; 0.1.  (Of course, this consequence is determined
by more than just the mass ratio, a complication we accept as part of the grey
area between qualitative classes.)  We again adopt a modified form of
Schweizer's notation, using upper case letters in the Hubble variable for the
primary galaxy and comparable companions, lower case for medium strength
companion interactions, and subscripts for low strength encounters.  Thus, E
<SUB><FONT SIZE=2>d</FONT></SUB> represents a disruptive collision between an
elliptical and a small disk.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;The last classification variable is for directionality or angular
momentum coupling.  For each disk component involved we assign a value of +,
0, or -, depending on whether the encounter is prograde, perpendicular (or
head-on), or retrograde, relative to the spin of that disk.  Thus, a recent
planar encounter between two comparable disk galaxies, at an early stage might
have a classification of YDD+- (or YDD++ or YDD--).  A variable of unknown
value will either be omitted, or highlighted with an x (e.g., YDDxx).  Another
example, an elliptical shell galaxy would be OE; a model of this galaxy might
be OE<SUB><FONT SIZE=2>d</FONT></SUB>+.  In the remainder of this article,
where appropriate, the collision categories described in each section will be
given in parenthesis in the section title.  The classification variables and
the range of values considered are summarized in <B>Table 1</B>.  </P>
