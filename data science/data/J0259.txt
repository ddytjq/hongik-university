1974 Ford LTD Wagon
<BR>
unknown motor
<br>
Car has been sitting for 10 years, but was only $50.00
<br>
The motor was junk, so I put in the motor from last years 78 Cougar.
<br>
Rewiring the motor to a toggle switch setup, was a pain, but I got it working
<br>
In the derby, I made about 4 hits and got stuck on a dead car.
<br>
Since the car was hardly damaged, I derbyed it again a month later.
<br>
I took it to the Sumpter Michigan "Run What You Brung" derby.
<br>
I drew the first heat. It was almost %100 roundback wagons and imperials. I think they did it on purpose. 
<br>
I was doing pretty good, till a roundback caught me sitting still and bent my front bumper around the motor.
<br> 
I was still running good, even though the raditor was shot.
<br>
My luck ran out when the shifter busted off.  I shut the motor off and was able to reconnect the shifter
<br> 
My day was done, though.  The motor would not turn over at all.
<br>
I brought the car back home.  I can probably pull the front endout and run it again next year
