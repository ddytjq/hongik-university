		experiences that you have had in supporting England whether at home or abroad.
		Which was the best match you've ever been to? What made it so great? What was
		the best atmosphere and what made it so much greater than usual? On the other
		hand, what was the worst game; the most nerve-racking - the most disastrous
		journey!<BR>Share all with other supporters of the England national football
		team. A free car sticker to all contributers whose stories make it to this

	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">"Saturday, after the game (England v
		Greece) and walking under the South Stand, who should pop out of one of the
		executive entrances, Frank Skinner. I was trying to wade through the crowd but
		I couldn't get anywhere near him to get his autograph as by now lots of other
		supporters saw me going towards him. With that the echoes of "Skinner, Skinner,
		Skinner, Skinner" roared through the tunnel under the stand, I couldn't get to
		him cos actually he went a bit shy or probably stunned at the chants he was
		receiving. Sorry Frank, ill try not to tell everybody next time!" <EM>Nathan,
		Telford</EM> </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">"While walking around the ground before
		the England vs Albania match in march I saw Jack Charlton. I approached Jack
		and asked him for his autograph, he signed my match ticket and I walked away
		rather pleased that I had Jack's autograph. Upon entering the ground I had my
		ticket ripped by a guy on the gate. It wasn't until i got home that I realised
		that the guy had ripped the part with Jack's autograph. How unlucky is that?!"

	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">"I went to watch england train in
		luxembourg - geezer on the gate wouldn't let me in so i went round the side and
		through someone's garden. Went to climb the fence and ripped the arse out of
		the only pair of jeans I had with me. Had to spend the next 2 days wearing a
		pair of John Gorman's tracksuit trousers. Tried to get Shearer's but he was
		having none of it. Cheers John, will return them one day!" <EM>Sam</EM>

	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">"I won a competition in the news of the
		world to see England play Portugal in Eindhoven (Euro 2000). My friend and
		myself found our way to our seats waiting for the game to start when Noel
		Gallagher and one of his body guards sat down in the row in front of us. A
		little while after my friend and myself was having a fag ,as you do, when my
		friend flicked his ash only to find the cherry on his fag come off and fell
		between Noel's leather jacket and the seat. With us not saying anything (best
		thought not to) we carried on watching the game only to see England score. When
		everyone jumped up the cherry had burnt a hole in his jacket!" <EM>Sy
