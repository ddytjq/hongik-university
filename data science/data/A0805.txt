<P>Despite all the efforts that have been made, 
it is now inevitable that Irish businesses will 
be largely unprepared when the euro arrives on 1 
January next. The latest Forfas survey, which was 
taken in June 2001, reveals high general awareness 
but little evidence that this has translated into 
practical action. Less than 30% of companies had 
discussed it with their suppliers or customers, 
almost 40% had not looked at their software to see 
if it could cope with the euro and an astonishing 
60% did not intend to train their staff - surely 
a recipe for disaster. The lack of action is greatest 
in very small firms, in the construction sector 
and in the Connaught/Ulster region.

</P>
<P>Only 3% had converted their systems to euro by 
mid-year, a further 25% intend to do so in the second 
half. This leaves a massive 72% who planned to do 
so on 1 January next or who simply didn't know what 
they were going to do. Of course, it 
is perfectly acceptable for companies 
to delay switching over to the euro until 
1 January 2002 if they have properly prepared 
and organised themselves to do so. The 
problem will lie with those that have 
not prepared and suddenly find that they 
have to make emergency arrangements, thereby 
adding to the pressures on others, or 
who find that they are no longer able 
to conduct their daily business efficiently, 
if at all.

</P>
<P>It is but cold comfort that we are 
not alone in this - Portugal, Greece, 
France, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands 
all seem to have similar problems. There 
is no obvious commercial reason at present 
for business to make the necessary investment 
of time and money and the fact that the 
Y2K turned out to be a damp squib does not help.

</P>
<P>What will happen to the unprepared? 
They will, overnight, have to prepare 
euro prices for all the products they 
sell. They will have to include euro 
prices on their invoices and if their 
software will not do this it will have 
to be done manually. If unprepared companies 
continue to invoice in Irish pounds, they 
may be returned unpaid with obvious cashflow 
implications. Irrespective of how the 
debt is paid, the payment will be credited 
in euro by the bank, which will lead to 
reconciliation problems for the invoicer. 
Invoices received by companies will generally 
be in euro, frequently with giro slips 
already precoded in euro - this will lead 
to further translation problems. All 
this converting will generate rounding 
problems and nightmare reconciliation 
difficulties. 

</P>
<P>All tax returns, VAT etc. will have 
to be made in euro whereas the firms' 
records will be in pounds - more conversion 
and rounding. If staff are not trained, 
there will be confusion over prices and 
what to tell customers. This will increase 
the size of the queue, slow down business 
and generate even more errors. Wrong 
change will be given and, worse still, 
euro and pound records may get mixed - 
this is known as data pollution and is 
reckoned as the greatest risk of the changeover. 
After all this, the unprepared company 
will have to changeover to euro anyway.

</P>
<P>Who is most exposed? Big companies 
are well prepared and while very small 
companies (less than 10 people) have done 
little, they will be able to manage the 
situation better than most because of 
the small scale of their operations and 
the simplicity of their account keeping. 
Their accounts are frequently based on 
cash receipts and payments with little 
or no requirement for information on debts, 
creditors, stocks or capital. These accounts 
are often kept on a simple excel spreadsheet. 
This is where the greatest danger of 
data pollution lies. All pound spreadsheets 
should be scrapped and new ones opened in euro. 

</P>
<P>That apart, however, the companies 
with the greatest problems are those in 
the "in between" category. This is, those 
big enough to have greater transaction 
volumes, more complex accounting systems 
and, above all, reliance on software packages 
especially non-standard or dated packages. 
It has been found that software described 
as euro compliant but may still not meet 
the particular requirements of the business 
and may not be able to effect the conversion 
in a manner that allows the business to 
switch to trading in euro on 1 January 
2002. Even if the software is available, 
an upgrade may be required and will take 
time to install. A discussion with your 
software provider should be an early priority.
