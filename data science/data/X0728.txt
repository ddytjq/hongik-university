    <small>The 2000 South Australian Horse of the Year was held in warm conditions at its
    regular venue of John Vaughan Equestrian Park at Bowden. Unfortunately the grass was worn
    in some parts of the main arena as the area showed the effects of being the launching area
    for the fireworks of Skyshow the previous week. Judges for this years event were Deborah
    Bell from NSW, Jan Smith, Grant Morley from Tas and Margaret Runcie from the UK. </small></font><p><font face="Arial" color="#004000"><small>The first class was the SA Champion Senior Rider of
    the Year 18 Years &amp; Over. Despite tough competition from many of South Australia's
    promising riders the experienced Margot Haynes reclaimed the title that she had won
    previously in 1998. Riding the Lawries' horse Prince of Thieves Margot gave a polished
    display of riding to take out the first event. Reserve Champion was awarded to Samantha
    Morgan-Glatz of Mount Barker riding her hack Knowing. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#004000"><small>The next class decided was the SA Champion
    Junior Rider of the Year Under 14 Years. It was a very tough assignment for the judge to
    choose from the talented youngsters. In the end Simone Montgomerie from Ungarra riding the
    chestnut pony County Liar was awarded the Champion prize with Melissa Karutz receiving the
    Reserve Champion award. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#004000"><small>The final rider event was the SA Champion
    Junior Rider of the Year 14 Years &amp; Under 18 Years. Despite the presence a number of
    former winners of this class it was 14 year old Lesley Burrow from Munno Para who won the
    title. Carmen Slater of One Tree Hill riding Touch of Elegance claimed the Reserve
    Champion prize. </small></font></p>

    feature classes on the Saturday was the Waverley Festivity Trophy. This event is sponsored
    by Charlotte Mitton in honour of her marvellous mare Waverley Festivity who was very
    successful in winning many champion awards at the Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney
    Royal shows from 1988 to 1992. It is awarded to the horse or pony in it first year of
    competition which the judges feel has the potential to go on to be awarded Champion titles
    in the future. The competitors in the class must also compete in a snaffle bridle. This
    year's class attracted a wide variety of entrants from youngstock from established show
    homes to successful ex racehorses. Ultimately it was the compact 3 year old grey pony <strong>Kirreway
    Cartier </strong>(Small Land Mascot (imp) - Weston Caroline) who won the award ridden by
    Jessica Winen and owned by C Winen. His champion qualities are already starting to show as
    he was one of the Pony of the Year finalists on Sunday. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#004000"><small>On Saturday afternoon three new awards were
    presented. With the growing interest in Show Hunter classes over the last couple of years
    these awards were added to this years program. </small></font></p>

    of the States most accomplished riders. It followed in the footsteps of Saturdays Champion

    was the SA Saddlehorse of the Year over 15hh. With a stunning field of thoroughbreds to
    fight out this award it was always going to be a hard decision for judges. Although many
    entrants seemed stirred by the frequent jumbos passing overhead (and resultant shadow
    passing over the grass) and the freight trains passing at the back of the area during
    their workouts it was a great display of South Australia's top combinations. After much
    deliberation Vicky Lawrie's dark chestnut gelding<strong> Kings </strong>(Covetous -
    November Babe) took out the Champion Award which followed up her 1999 win with Gosh in
    this event. <strong>Neon</strong> (Grosvenor - Emblem), who once raced as the accomplished
    Flagstaff, took out the Reserve Champion award for Charlotte Mitton. </small></font></p>

    who helped in getting the ears forward for the pictures and the organisers who allowed
    time for the photo sessions.</font></small></p>
