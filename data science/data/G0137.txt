<H2><A NAME="LSSotUniverse">III. THE LARGE-SCALE STRUCTURE OF
THE UNIVERSE</A> </H2>

<H3><A NAME="GmapsandLSS">Galaxy Maps and Large-Scale Structure</A>
</H3>

<H4><A NAME="Wilssawiisi">What is large-scale structure, and why
is it important?</A> </H4>

<P>
Although the intensity of the CMBR is extremely uniform in all
directions, with fluctuations measured at only 1 part in 10<SUP>5</SUP>,
the local distribution of galaxies is extremely irregular, with
fluctuations in the density of galaxies per volume of space being
well in excess of 100 percent. Maps of the distribution of galaxies
in space reveal a remarkable pattern of thin, filamentary structures
connecting small and large central concentrations of galaxies,
punctuated by large, quasi-spherical voids. The example of the
map shown in <A HREF="1.html#Fig2">Figure 2</A> is the result
of several years of painstaking spectroscopic observations with
modest-size optical telescopes. The far-flung distribution of
galaxies in the universe, the complex assemblage of clusters,
filaments, and voids, is referred to as large-scale structure.
<P>
It is not surprising that galaxies are clustered. As explained
above, the early universe contained small density irregularities,
as measured by fluctuations in the CMBR, and the amplitude of
these small bumps grew via their self-gravity to make the structure
seen today. This condition of gravitational instability can amplify
the initial density fluctuations of seeds on all scales. Galaxies
and large-scale structure are all part of the same process; both
are relics of the Big Bang. 
<P>
Finding clumps of galaxies was thus expected, but their huge extent
caught astronomers by surprise. Typical voids are 200&nbsp;million
light-years across, and one enormous curtain-like structure-the
Great Wall-is draped across the universe in a span half a billion
light-years across. Even this large size, however, is less than
a tenth the scale measured by the COBE satellite discussed above.
Altogether, the distances involved in the study of large-scale
structure range over a factor of a million, from the size of galaxies
to the CMBR anisotropy measured by the COBE satellite. This combination
of observations gives us a powerful probe of Big Bang density
fluctuations over a wide range of scales. The extent of early
density fluctuations on different size scales and their subsequent
growth under gravity are critical clues to the nature and amount
of dark matter in the universe, as explained below. 
<H4><A NAME="maptheLSS">Mapping the large-scale structure</A>
</H4>

<P>
Making maps of galaxies in three dimensions requires knowing how
far away each galaxy is from Earth. One way to get this distance
is to use Hubble's law for the expansion of the universe. Hubble
discovered that the velocity at which two galaxies recede from
each other is proportional to the distance between them. Inverting
this relation yields an estimate of distance from observed velocity.
The velocity with which a galaxy is receding from us is obtained
by measuring the shift to redder colors of spectral features in
its spectrum, a &quot;redshift&quot; analogous to the familiar
Doppler shift in the frequency of sound waves from a receding
source. The greater the redshift, the larger the velocity, and,
by Hubble's law, the larger the distance.
<P>
We are truly living in the age of mapping the universe. The last
decade has seen a revolution in the technology of light detectors
that has made it possible to measure redshifts rapidly, even with
modest-size telescopes. In 1976, there were only 2,700 galaxies
with measured redshifts-now there are 100,000. By the year 2000
astronomers expect 1 million! This field of astronomy is still
on a steep discovery curve. 
<H4><A NAME="Tiofunivgalaxsurv">The importance of uniform galaxy
surveys</A> </H4>

<P>
The first step in making a redshift survey is compiling a catalog
of galaxy positions and brightnesses on the sky. Traditionally
such catalogs have been based on photographic surveys taken in
visible light. We are learning, though, that even small biases
in the list of target galaxies may have a big effect on the final
maps. Hence there is strong interest in new and better ways of
finding galaxies. Three basic avenues are being explored. Deeper
surveys of the whole sky in visible light are being conducted
using highly sensitive detectors (called charge-coupled devices;
CCDs) that can detect intrinsically faint galaxies, galaxies of
low surface brightness, and distant galaxies. Near-infrared surveys
of the sky at 2-micron wavelength will make it possible for the
first time to observe the dip down near the plane of our galaxy,
whose dust clouds obscure 35&nbsp;percent of the sky in visible
light. Finally, x-ray satellite surveys provide yet another means
of mapping clusters of galaxies.
<P>
A fundamental question is whether one large section of the universe
looks like another. In other words, how large do sections have
to be before they begin to appear statistically uniform? Unfortunately,
a single ground-based observatory sees only a portion of the sky.
To achieve the high degree of uniformity needed over the whole
sky requires careful surveys. There are three requirements: First,
individual surveys must cover as much of the celestial sphere
as possible. Second, surveys must be closely coordinated and well
standardized so that they can be knitted together. Finally, homogeneous
all-sky surveys need to be conducted by satellites above Earth,
such as the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS), a joint mission
of the United States, the United Kingdom, and The Netherlands
that was flown in 1983. 
<P>
A major goal for the next generation of surveys is to increase
their range out to 3 billion light-years, roughly 20 percent of
the radius of the visible universe. On such scales cosmologists
would be probing structures that are the same size as the smallest
structures in the COBE<I> </I>microwave map. The clustering behavior
of galaxies over an extremely wide range of scales could be measured
and compared directly to the CMBR anisotropy with no extrapolation.
This would tell us how the density fluctuations have evolved from
the epoch of CMBR emission (the epoch of photon decoupling) to
the present. This information would yield essential clues to the
amount and nature of dark matter in the universe.
<H4><A NAME="TOLSS">Theory of large-scale structure</A> </H4>

<P>
Statistical description and theoretical modeling of the observed
galaxy distribution have been extremely productive over the past
decade. Much of this modeling has been done with large computer
simulations on the largest available supercomputers. This is a
problem in the &quot;grand challenge&quot; class, with the goal
of understanding in detail the formation of structure on both
small and large scales. The models typically follow the evolution
of a large patch of the universe. Calculations start with random
initial fluctuations as statistically predicted for different
cosmological parameters and different types of dark matter. The
equations governing the gravitational coupling, as well as other
physical processes, are then solved numerically by the computer.
Starting from small amplitudes, the fluctuations become increasingly
larger, as expected from the gravitational instability picture.
The computational results can then be compared to the observed
properties of large-scale structure in the universe. With careful
analysis, such comparisons can set constraints on the amount and
nature of dark matter. Some proposed dark-matter candidates have
already been ruled out in this way. <A HREF="#Fig3">Figure 3</A>
is a recent example of a numerical simulation, processed with
similar selection criteria as for observational redshift surveys.
The similarity in the voids and filaments shown in Figures 2 and
3 is striking.
<P>
Clusters of galaxies, with size on the order of 3 million light-years
and mass of 10<SUP>15</SUP> Suns, are central to our understanding
of structure. Astronomers have recently discovered that galactic
cores are dense enough to act as gravitational lenses (discussed
in section IV in &quot;Gravitational Lenses&quot;), that most
of the baryonic (ordinary) matter within them is in the form of
hot gas, not galaxies, that dark matter constitutes approximately
80 percent of their total mass, and that they show a considerable
amount of substructure when examined at high spatial resolution.
The abundance of clusters and their detailed internal structure
are predicted by models to be sensitive to assumptions about properties
of the dark matter and the total amount of matter in the universe.
Only the most powerful parallel supercomputers can adequately
represent the gravitational and gas dynamical processes at sufficient
resolution to model clusters. <BR>

An even more challenging problem is the question of how galaxies
formed. For decades these fundamental building blocks of the universe
were taken for granted, but now cosmologists realize that galaxy
formation represents the smallest scale of the overall process
of structure formation. Galaxy formation is fearsomely complicated
because it involves the detailed physics of gas clouds, not just
the simple pull of gravity. For example, in order to fall into
a forming galaxy, gas has to cool first, which involves the emission
of radiation. The cold gas then forms into stars. (Astronomers
are not sure just how or how fast.) Dying stars in turn eject
energy and gas back into the gas reservoir of the galaxy via supernova
explosions. All the while, gas clouds are colliding and pushing
one another around via shock waves and gas pressure. A galaxy
is a complex system. 
<P>
In the past few years computer advances have made possible the
first attempts to calculate galaxy formation starting from expanding
universe models and including the effects of gas. The results
are encouraging, but much more computer power is needed to obtain
accurate results. Fortunately, with the continuing development
of ever-more-powerful computers and sophisticated gas-modeling
techniques, one can reasonably hope that progress in this field
will be rapid.
<H3><A NAME="CVF">Cosmic Velocity Flows</A> </H3>

<H4><A NAME="Wacfasati">What are cosmic flows, and why are they
important?</A> </H4>

<P>
Galaxy maps of the universe by themselves are unreliable tracers
of the true density of matter because astronomers do not know
precisely how or where galaxies formed. Perhaps matter did not
&quot;light up&quot; equally in all places to make visible galaxies.
Matter that did not form into galaxies may exist today but be
invisible. Astronomers sum up this question by asking: Do galaxies
fairly trace mass? This cannot be told from redshift maps alone.
<P>
Cosmic flows offer a way to answer this question because they
are generated by the gravity of all matter, whether luminous or
not. These flows are the irregularities in the Hubble expansion
that are created (according to gravitational instability) as galaxies
stream out of voids and fall onto clusters and superclusters.
A map of cosmic flows can be used to generate a map of the mass
density distribution that caused them, including any dark matter
between the galaxies. Such a map is shown in the upper panel of
<A HREF="#Fig4">Figure 4</A>, along with a map of the directly
observed galaxy distribution of the same region in the lower panel.
The two roughly agree, suggesting that galaxies do trace mass,
at least approximately. This result is important evidence that
the gravitational instability picture is basically correct.<BR>

The density distribution of mass inferred from studies of large-scale flow using the POTENT method (upper panel) is compared with the density distribution of galaxies derived from the Infra-Red Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) redshift survey (lower panel). The two distributions have been smoothed and are shown in the supergalactic plane. The height in the plot is proportional to the density fluctuation about the mean density of the universe. The Local Group of galaxies is at the center, the Great Attractor (GA) on the left, the Perseus-Pisces (PP) supercluster on the right, and the Sculptor void in between. The similarity between the two density fields indicates that galaxies tend to trace mass and that the cosmological parameter is of order unity. (Courtesy of Yair Sigad, Avishai Dekel, Michael A.

<P>
Because cosmic flows can measure the clustering of matter on even
very large scales, they are the best indicator of the absolute
level of density fluctuations in the universe today. This indicator
of density fluctuations can be compared to the strength of CMBR
fluctuations on larger scales at earlier times. Close to Earth,
within 250 million light-years where flows are well measured,
flow velocities have approximately the magnitude predicted if
standard dark-matter theories employ the COBE measurements. This
local agreement suggests that our basic model for structure formation,
spanning many decades of length scale and depending on details
of the nature of dark matter, is approximately correct.
<P>
By measuring the size of the flow motions around particular clumps
of galaxies, astronomers can estimate the total amount of matter
in each one. If galaxies trace the distribution of matter, or
even if not, as long as their distribution is biased in a consistent
and predictable way, astronomers can generalize from the galaxy
masses to estimate the total matter density in the universe. In
short, astronomers can &quot;weigh the universe&quot; and measure
the elusive parameter the ratio of the mean mass density to that
required to close the universe and eventually stop its expansion.
<P>
Our present knowledge of galaxy formation and biasing is still
poor. Nevertheless, cosmologists can draw two conclusions. First,
measurements of cosmic flows on all scales are an important test
of competing theories of structure formation. And second, the
high values observed for cosmic velocity flows are the strongest
indicator so far that might actually be 1, a value favored by
theoretical considerations, as explained below in section V.
<H4><A NAME="Mcf">Measuring cosmic flows</A> </H4>

<P>
Since cosmic flow is a deviation from the Hubble-law motion of
a galaxy, measuring it requires two types of observations: First,
the observed redshift of the galaxy must be measured from its
spectrum. Second, an independent estimate of the distance of the
galaxy must be made, which is much more difficult. If a galaxy
has no motion other than the Hubble flow, its redshift will correlate
perfectly with its distance via Hubble's law. Any deviation outside
of that due to errors in the estimated distance represents the
cosmic flow.
<P>
Unfortunately, distances are hard to estimate, and errors can
lead to spurious measurements of cosmic flows. The distance to
galaxies is usually estimated by the Tully-Fisher relation, which
states that big galaxies rotate faster than small ones. (Rotation
speed can be measured from features in optical or radio spectra.)
Rotation rate is thus a measure of true galaxy brightness, allowing
one to deduce how far away a galaxy is based on its apparent brightness.
The Tully-Fisher relation has an accuracy of about 15 percent.
This translates to an error in flow motion of 600 km/s at a distance
of 200 million light-years, and the error grows with distance.
Even the largest cosmic motions are no bigger than this. By averaging
together several galaxies in a group or cluster, the error can
be reduced, but measuring flows is still only reliable out to
about 400 million light-years using current methods. 
<P>
Two conclusions follow. First, cosmic flow surveys are limited
by distance errors to volumes that are much smaller than those
sampled by redshift surveys. Second, distance measuring techniques
with smaller errors are badly needed to increase the viable range
of cosmic-flow surveys. At present, the catalog of flow motions
contains about 3,000 galaxies out to a radius of 300 million light-years
over the whole sky. This volume can be enlarged incrementally
with current methods, but a major increase would require better
measures of distance. More accurate distance measures would also
allow us to study nearby motions more precisely, make better density
maps, and derive a more precise measure of the mean mass density
of the universe. An improvement in the accuracy of distance measurements
by as little as 30 percent would be extremely important. Several
approaches are under study, including improvements to the Tully-Fisher
method as well as some entirely new methods.
<H3><A NAME="SandPforLSS">Summary and Prospects for Large-Scale
Structure</A> </H3>

<P>
Cosmic flow measurements and redshift maps go hand in hand, since
the structures they reveal arise from the same cause. Combining
these two tools has already had a big impact on our view of structure
in the universe. When combined with the COBE<I> </I>measurement
of CMBR fluctuations, flow measurements and maps have quantified
the fluctuation amplitudes on virtually all scales of interest.
Estimates of mass on the scales of galaxy clusters and on smaller
scales appear to suggest that the density of the universe is low,
a factor of 10 less than required for closure of the universe
( 0.1). This result has been known for two decades and has not
changed with recent data. On the other hand, the newer data on
large-scale flows, which measure mass on scales 30 times larger
than the older work, seem to suggest that the universe may contain
sufficient density for closure ( 0.5 to 1). This contradiction
must be telling us something about the nature of the dark matter
distribution. It appears as though the dark matter clusters only
weakly with galaxies and groups of galaxies but clusters more
strongly on the larger scales of superclusters. At present, it
is not clear how these apparently contradictory observations can
be reconciled. Whether any of the current models of large-scale
structure can describe all the observations is an open question.
<P>
The field of large-scale structure is still growing rapidly from
the infusion of new data, and even more ambitious surveys are
now in the planning stages. Prospects also exist for improvement
in the accuracy of the distance indicators for galaxies. With
better data and theoretical tools, cosmologists have the prospect
of solving several key cosmic mysteries: What is the nature of
the dark matter and how dense is it? What is the average density
of matter in the universe? Is it near the closure density, W =
1, or is it much less than that, as some measurements seem to
indicate? Where and how were galaxies formed? <BR>
