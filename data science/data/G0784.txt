<u>Radio Galaxies</u></Font>
<p>
In the mid-1950s it was discovered that powerful radio sources are frequently
associated with giant elliptical galaxies.  This was a surprise because 
galaxies had been thought to be collections of billions of stars along with 
bits of hydrogen gas and dust.  Stars like the sun are not strong radio 
emitters, nor is the Milky Way a powerful radio source, though there is a weak 
source, Sagittarius A, at the center.  But these gE radio galaxies emit radio 
energy that outshines the combined light of the hundreds of billions of stars 
in the galaxy by as much as a factor of 100!  The first radio galaxy 
discovered was Cygnus A whose radio structure, typical of giant radio galaxies,
is shown below.  The radio emission comes principally from giant radio lobes,
well outside the visible portions of the galaxy, sometimes covering several 
million light-years.  Frequently there is also a radio core, coincident with 
the galaxy nucleus.

<Table><td><b>
The origin of the radio emission from Cygnus A and other radio galaxies was 
soon identified by UCSD's Geoffrey Burbidge as <i>Synchrotron Emission</i>,
light produced by "relativistic" electrons, moving near the speed of light, 
spiralling around lines of magnetic force.  But many puzzling questions 
remained:
<ul>
<li>What is the source of the tremendous radio power from radio galaxies?
<li>What mechanism accelerates the electrons to such intense energies with 
speeds over 99.99% of the speed of light?
<li>How are the relativistic particles and magnetic field transported from 
the galaxy itself, where they must originate, out to distances of millions 
of light years?
<li>How do the electrons, which quickly radiate away their energy, maintain 
their high speeds over a journey which must take millions of years?

<p>
As more detailed radio studies have become available, astronomers have traced
the source of radio power back to the galaxy nucleus.  These studies show that
intense beams or jets, moving with highly-relativistic speeds are transporting
the electrons and magnetic field out to the radio lobes.  The radio lobes are 
believed to be produced when the jets ram into intergalactic gas clouds or 
possibly the interstellar medium of nearby dwarf galaxies.  These jets are
just like the jets that are believed to be responsible for quasars' 
super-luminal expansion, except that in this case we do not see them pointed 
at us.  Time dilation, caused by moving at speeds almost equal to the speed of 
light allows the jets to carry the synchrotron electrons out to the radio 
lobes before they lose their energy.

What is the ultimate source of energy?  Most astronomers suspect that, like 
the quasars, powerful radio galacxies are powered by a massive black hole in 
the galaxy nucleus.

<u>Seyfert Galaxies</u></Font>
<p>
<Table><td><b>
In 1943, astronomer Carl Seyfert noticed that certain nearby spiral galaxies 
have very bright, pinpoint nuclei.  Spectra of these galaxies, now named
Seyfert galaxies, showed that they have unusual spectra with very strong, 
often broad, emission lines.</b></td>

<p>
Seyfert galaxies are divided into two classes, based upon the widths of their 
spectral emission features.  The Seyfert 1 galaxy above has hydrogen emission 
features with very large widths, indicating that the gas in the galaxy's 
central 
regions is moving with velocities of several thousand km/sec (Seyfert 1
galaxies show velocities up to almost 0.1c).  Compare the Seyfert 1 spectrum 
with the spectrum of the quasar 3C273, on the previous page.  In many respects 
Seyfert 1 galaxies are like "mini-quasars" and many astronomers believe that Seyfert 1 
galaxies are in fact lower luminosity examples of the quasar phenomenon.
<p>
<Center>
<img src="./images/sy2_spec.gif"></Center><p>
The Seyfert 2 galaxy shown above has much narrower emission features implying 
much 
lower velocities (note that the Seyfert 1 above shows narrow features as well).

too near the central black hole are ripped apart by tidal forces, falling 
inward to form an <i>accretion disk</i>.  Which slowly carries material inward
to the Black Hole.  Gravitational energy released by the inward spiral of the 
material heats the disk to temperatures of millions of Kelvin in the inner 
region, which is a strong source of x-rays.  Black holes are "messy eaters"
some of the material pulled inward is ejected at velocitiess near the speed of 
light along the rotation axis of the Black Hole, producing the jets seen at 
radio wavelengths.

These clouds are ionized and heated by ultraviolet and x-ray photons from the

broad emission features seen in spectra of quasars and Seyfert 1 galaxies
