    is essential that the property and its contents are adequately insured and
    the Society can arrange cover with a major insurance company to suit your
    needs. The insurance policy arranged will provide protection to your
    property OR combined property and contents against major causes of loss or
    damage. It is a convenient, easy and inexpensive method of arranging your
    insurance needs. The amount of buildings insurance cover is based on a
    figure recommended by our valuers, the contents are automatically insured up
    to a maximum of £35,000. If your contents exceed this figure please advise
    the Society immediately.</font>

    arrangements with its Insurers for Buildings or Buildings and Contents
    Insurance do not require completion of detailed insurance proposal forms.
    However, a contract of insurance requires disclosure of all facts which an
    insurer would regard as likely to influence the acceptance and assessment of
    an insurance proposal.<br>
    If you are in any doubt about facts considered material, you should disclose
    them. Failure to do so may affect the settlement of a claim or render the
    policy invalid.<br>
    If any answer is YES, or you are in any doubt as to whether facts are
    material, please give full details on a separate sheet attached to this
    application form.<br>
    You should keep a record (including copies of letters) of all information
    supplied for the purposes of entering into the insurance contract.</font></p>
