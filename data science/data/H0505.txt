<h3>Update on Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci</h3>
<p>by
<a href="mailto:gjt@bugs.uah.ualberta.ca"> Dr. G. Tyrrell</a>
<p><font SIZE="+1"><b>VRE</b></font>. These three letters invoke a sense of urgency in clinical microbiologists, infection control practitioners and infectious disease physicians across Canada. The letters of course refer to vancomycin resistant 
enterococci. </p>
<p>What exactly does it mean when an organism such as the Enterococcus is vancomycin resistant? Beside 
the obvious that it can now grow in the presence of vancomycin, it also means that the organism has acquired an incredible array of genes which code for enzymes that permit this growth phenomenon to 
happen. High level vancomycin resistance in the Enterococcus is the result of the acquisition of 6 genes necessary for this phenotype and is not the result of spontaneous mutation. This point must not be lost. This means that for the patient to acquire a VRE, the patient must contract the organism from some outside 
source. VRE do not arise in the patient spontaneously. This fact has prompted hospitals across Canada to set into place screening programs for new patients who have come from areas of the world including parts of Canada  where VRE is believed to be present.</p>

<p>How such an intricate mechanism of resistance evolved is open to debate. What is even more interesting is that this phenomenon has occurred not once but twice (VanA and VanB) and perhaps three times (VanD). </p>
<p>What exactly is the function of this constellation of genes mediating vancomycin resistance? The phenotype 
best characterized genetically is VanA. VanA resistance in some strains is present on a transposon designated Tn<i>1546</i>. Tn<i>1546</i> has been divided into five functional regions: 
<ol>
<li>transposition
<li>regulation
<li>precusor synthesis
<li>precursor degradation
<li>a gene necessary for teicoplanin resistance. </ol>
<p>The region encoding transposition functions consists of a transposase gene and a resolvase gene. This region is 
followed by vanR and vanS, genes responsible for regulating expression of vancomycin resistance. 
<p>VanS is a membrane protein which, in the presence of vancomycin, turns on vanR. The  vanR gene product then stimulates the transcription of the genes, vanH, vanA, vanX, vanY and vanZ. The vanH protein is a D-specific   keto reductase which synthesizes D-lactate. 
<p>VanA is a D-ala-D-x ligase which has a higher affinity for D-lactate rather than D-alanine, the usual substrate for the growing peptidoglycan wall of Enterococci. 
This substrate specificity results in the formation of depsipeptides eg. D-ala-D-lac. However, the formation of D-ala-D-ala continues in the cell due to the activity of the native enterococcal D-ala-D-ala ligase. Because vancomycin binds to D-ala-D-ala substrates, a mechanism is required to prevent D-ala-D-ala from being 
incorporated into the cell wall. VanX and vanY perform this function. </p>
<p>VanX is a highly specific D,D-dipeptidase which cleaves D-ala-D-ala dipeptides that have formed in the cell. </p>
<p>VanY is a membrane associated D,D-carboxypeptidase which cleaves D-ala off the native pentapeptide UDP-MurNAc-L-ala-D-
glu-L-lys-D-ala-D-ala thereby preventing D-ala-D-ala containing precusors from translocating the membrane. </p>
<p>The vanZ gene plays a role in teicoplanin (another glycopeptide antibiotic) resistance, the exact mechanism being unclear.   </p>
<p>One of the more interesting aspects of the VanA resistance phenotype is the double fail safe mechanism 
elaborated by vanX and vanY, both enzymes which cleave D-ala from peptidoglycan precursors. Previous investigators have demonstrated that loss of the vanY gene does not render the enterococcal cell susceptible. </p>
<p>This is presumably due to the activity of vanX cleaving the majority of D-ala dimer. However, loss of both 
the vanX and vanY genes does render the enterococcal cell wall vancomycin susceptible. This has suggested that the contribution of the vanY gene product to vancomycin resistance is moderate at most. 
<p>It is suspected that VanA and VanB are not recently derived from each other because of the level of  amino acid  identity between the genes from each  operon. 
<p>A direct comparison of the amino acid identity between the genes of the 2 operons is as follows: vanR vs vanRb (34%), vanS vs vanSb (23%), vanH vs vanHb (67%), vanA vs vanB (76%), vanX vs vanXb (71%) and  vanY vs vanYb (30%). There is no homologue to vanZ in the VanB operon. Also, the vanWb gene present in the VanB operon has no 
homologue in the VanA operon. </p>
<p>Another interesting aspect of VRE is the finding that only a small percentage of the enterococcus peptidoglycan layer need be structurally altered from D-ala-D-ala to D-ala-D-lac to cause an increase in the vancomycin MIC.  Only 10% of the peptidoglycan need be altered from D-ala-D-ala to D-ala-D-lac to 
increase the MIC of vancomycin from 2 to 32 ug/ml. </p>
<p>Why so little of the target for vancomycin in the 
Enterococcus cell wall needs to be altered to effect resistance is unclear.  
<p>One of the more frightening questions being contemplated with regards to vancomycin resistance in the 
Enterococcus is if and when will these transferable vancomycin resistance operons make the genus jump 
from Enterococcus to organisms such as Methicillin Resistance Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 3rd 
generation cephalosporin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Transfer of VRE genes from the 
Enterococcus to other bacteria has already occurred in nature. The VanA operon has transferred from the 
Enterococcus to <i>Arcanobacterium haemolyticum</i> and <i>Oerskovia turbata</i>. Also, the VanB operon has been 
discovered to have transferred from the Enterococcus to <i>Streptococcus bovis</i>.  
<p>Investigators have also demonstrated the transferability of the VanA operon from the Enterococcus into 
<i>Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus lactis, Listeria spp</i>. and into 
<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> in the laboratory. One must question the ethical guidelines such experiments are 
conducted under. Because of these experiments and the transfers that have been found to occur in nature, 
it is perhaps only a matter of time before transfer occurs from the Enterococcus into MRSA and/or <i>S. pneumoniae</i> provided no investigator decides or is allowed to create such an organism in the laboratory first. 
Nature does not need a helping hand. 
	What challenges lie ahead for investigators with respect to 
VRE? This can be best understood by the questions that are as yet unanswered. These include: 
<ol>
<li>What is the origin of vancomycin resistance gene clusters? 
<li>What is the mechanism of vanZ mediated teicoplanin resistance? 
<li>Why are two enzymes (vanX and vanY) necessary to perform similar functions? 
<li>Will the vancomycin resistance genotype in the Enterococcus transfer into <i>S. aureus</i> and/or <i>S. pneumoniae</i>? 
<li>How do vanR and vanS recognize the presence of vancomycin? and 
<li>How many variants besides VanA, VanB, and now perhaps VanD actually exist out there in nature and 
did all of these events arise independently of each other?
