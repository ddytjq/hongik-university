<h3> Abstract </h3>
</center>

The 3' flanking nucleotide(s) of the octanucleotide promoter sequence
regulates transcriptional efficiency of some mitochondrial genes in
<em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>. To understand this regulation the in vitro
transcriptional activity of various synthetic mitochondrial promoters
carrying different 3' flanking sequences was examined. The results
presented here demonstrate that consecutive thymidine residues, but no
other polynucleotides or secondary structure, in the promoter-proximal
non-transcribed DNA strand inhibited mitochondrial transcription. The
location and the number of T residues in the cluster as well as the
concentration of UTP in the transcription reaction are the important factors
determining this transcriptional inhibition. For example, a pair of thymidine
nucleotides at positions +2 and +3 is sufficient for inactivation of
mitochondrial transcription, whereas more than three consecutive
thymidine nucleotides beyond these positions are required for inhibition of
mitochondrial transcription. However, a cluster of six to 12 thymidine
residues beyond position +11, a point where mtRNA polymerase has been
shown to form a stable transcription complex, did not interfere with
mitochondrial transcription. Interestingly, at low UTP concentration the
mtRNA polymerase generates a large quantity of aborted initiation
products on a template carrying promoter-proximal poly(T) sequence
probably due to the inability of the polymerase to clear this promoter. On
the other hand at high UTP concentration the same mtRNA polymerase on
the same mitochondrial promoter produces a higher level of productive
initiation complex. These observations suggest that the mechanism of
poly(T) inhibition of mitochondrial transcription is a UTP-limited
transcriptional attenuation at the promoter site, which might occur under
specific physiological conditions (i.e. glucose repression-derepression,
switching of aerobic-anaerobic conditions).
