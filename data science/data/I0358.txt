Enough about Beckham, when did you realise that you had a talent, Joe?<br>
"I first started playing when I was 11 for a team called Chapel Boys. I was one of the better players in the team, and at school, but I never really took the game seriously enough then to think, 'I'm going to make it proffesional. I just enjoyed being around my mates and having a kick around. Not until I actually made my debut agaainst Swansea in the FA Cup did it really hit home that I could make it."<p>

Do you come from a footballing family?<br>
"No not at all. In fact, we're more of a boxing family. My dad and his brothers were big fans of the fight game and spent a lot of time messing about in the ring at our local gym. So I don't know where football came from but getting in the ring never really appealed to me."<p>

How did attending the FA School at Lilleshall help your progression?<br>
"It made me grow up. I was only 14, was living away from my family and it helped me to mature as a person. I was the only player from my year to make it but Francis Jeffers of Everton and Scott Parker of Charlton were in the year above. Francis was a good friend but he used to pick on me and along with Scott would bundle and bash me up! But I loved my time there."<p>

Did you have trials with any other clubs?<br>
"Yeah, I trained with most of the top London clubs and I probably could have signed for any of them but West ham just felt comfortable and right and they were always my first choice. Most of my family are Spurs fans and my Nan wouldn't talk to me for a while when I moved here! My dad just told me to choose where I felt most comfortable, and he'd happily drive me there to training every day. And I think he may have regretted saying it as West Ham were the furthest away and we'd have to travel right across London in rush-hour traffic!"<p>

Is it true Sir Alex Ferguson gave you a United shirt with your name on it?<br>
"No, it wasn't Sir Alex, it was someone from the youth team. And, anyway, by that stage I knew I wanted to join West Ham. The same thing happened with other clubs who would send me shirts and tickets to come along to a game. Every kid loves to wear football shirts and it was great to have brand new ones to choose from. But it did get a bit embarrassing as kids who didn't know me thought I must be some rich kid from a loaded family!"<p>

How did it feel to be in the newspapers when you were just 15?<br>
"It was strange but it helped me deal with the pressure when I first came into the first team. The kids and teachers at school were great about it and it also helped me become popular withe the girls-which came in handy!"<p>

Tell us about this wonder goal you scored as a kid?<br>
"It doesn't really count as it took place in the playground in one of those school games which must have been something like about 20-a-side. I took the ball off our ,keeper  went round the whole team and back heeled the ball into the top corner. The special thing about it was that I didn't let the ball touch the ground once."<p>

Who did you support as a boy?<br>
"Chelsea, but I fell out of love with them when I joined West Ham. My friend used to get us tickets for Stamford Bridge.My favourite player was Vinnie Jones as every game he would crunch someone and the Chelsea fans would love it. But I'm West Ham through and through now."<p>

Which players do you look up to at the club?<br>
"I've learnt so much from the likes of Paolo Di Canio, Rio and Igor Stimac. They're all world class stars who could play anywhere. Igor is as big in Croatia as Beckham is here. When he flew to Croatia this season he just strolled upto the cockpit and sat with the pilots. And the landing was so bad we all reckoned they were so in awe of him that they allowed him to land the plane."<p>

Who is your best friend in football?<br>
"I have two, Ian Armstrong at Liverpool and Craig Pead, who is with Coventry. And when we roomed together at Lilleshall the house master claimed we had the dirtiest in the 15 years it been running! I wouldn't clean up as the other two wouldn't lift a finger and they claimed I was the same. So nothing ever got done. I room with Michael Carrick now and he claims that I'm too messy as well."<p>

Can you win things with West Ham?<br>
"Yeah, I'm sure I can. We have so many good young players at the club - I'd say we have as many as Leeds. And in a couple of years there's no reason why we can't be challenging for trophies. I honestly thought we'd win the Worthington Cup this season until the problem against Villa came about. But I doubt there's ever been a time when West Ham have had so many good young players and the future here looks very bright."<p>

Have you thought about Euro 2000?<br>
"It is in the back of my mind but first and foremost I'm thinking about West Ham. I'd only think of England when and if I was called into the full squad. I was delighted to meet up with England Under-21 when we played Argentina and it was another good experience for me."<p>

Has Kevin Keegan been in contact?<br>
"Not since he invited me to train with the squad before the Sweden game. I got a great buzz training alongside England's best players and I felt comfortable enough to play with them. The thing I found nerve racking was having lunch with them afterwards - I thought they'd be thinking, 'What's he doing here?'"<p><!-- text below generated by server.
