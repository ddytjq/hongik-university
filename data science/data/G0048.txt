<font color="ffaa00"><b>1800:</b></font> Sir William Herschel discovers
infrared radiation.  He 
detects infrared light by measuring the temperatures in the colors of the solar
spectrum created by passing sunlight through a prism.  The area just beyond
the visible red, in a region where there was no visible light, registered
the highest temperature.  This discovery shows for the first time that there
are forms of light which we cannot see with our eyes.

Infrared radiation is detected from the moon by Piazzi
Smyth.  He uses a thermocouple (a device which converts heat into electric
current) to detect infrared from the full moon. Piazzi also tests observations
at different altitudes and shows that better observations are obtained
at higher altitudes.

The 4th Earl of Rosse detects infrared radiation from the moon during several
of its phases.  He uses his infrared measurements to estimate that the Moon
has a surface temperature of about 500 degrees Fahrenheit. 
(We now know that it is about 540 degrees Fahrenheit.)

Astronomers begin to use Lead-sulphide (PbS) detectors to study infrared 
radiation. When infrared radiation in this range falls on a PbS cell it
changes the resistance of the cell. This change in resistance can
be measured and is related to the amount of infrared radiation
which falls upon the cell. To increase the sensitivity of the PbS
cell it was cooled to a temperature of 77 degrees Kelvin by
placing it in a flask filled with liquid nitrogen.

The germanium bolometer is developed by Frank Low.
This instrument is hundreds of
times more sensitive than previous detectors and capable of
detecting far-infrared radiation.   
When infrared radiation hits
the germanium, it warms the metal and changes its conductivity.
The change in conductivity can be measured and is
related to the amount of infrared radiation entering
the container. The germanium bolometer works best at an
extremely low temperature (much lower than liquid nitrogen). It
is placed in a metal container (Dewar) filled with liquid helium
which cools the bolometer to 4 degrees Kelvin (only a few degrees above
absolute zero).

dust grains around the star Vega, six new comets, and very strong infrared
emission from interacting galaxies as well as wisps of warm dust called infrared

NASA launches the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) in November 1989,
to study both infrared

the extreme heat that was created by the Big Bang). Over the next four years,
COBE maps the brightness of the entire sky at several infrared wavelengths
and discovers that the cosmic background radiation is not entirely smooth,
showing extremely small variations in temperature. These variations may have led
to the formation of galaxies.
