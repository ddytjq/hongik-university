<h3>PROGRAM OBJECTIVE</H3>

                To provide a mechanistic understanding of how microorganisms and contaminants
                are transported under coupled and interactive physical, geochemical, and microbial
                processes and how underlying molecular and interfacial phenomena and natural

Many microbial and geochemical processes that are effective in small-scale
                laboratory experiments fail in field applications.  This can be attributed to factors
                such as geochemical and hydrogeological heterogeneity, spatial variability in the
                distribution of contaminants, difficulty in characterizing and interpreting the
                geological and hydrological setting, lack of control of nutrient or contaminant
                availability and moisture content of the soil, or the lack of sufficient
                populations or activity of microbial consortia able to biotransform,
                biodegrade, or detoxify the contaminants.  Recent experience suggests
                that successful bioremediation depends on three factors:<p>
                <menu>
                1.  The presence of microbial consortia and plants that can
                                    biotransform, biodegrade, and detoxify contaminants of
                                    interest.<p>
               2.   The availability of nutrients and contaminants to the microbiota
                                    and plants.<p>
               3.   Environmental conditions that are conducive to survival, growth,
                                    and activity such that the desired biotransformations occur at a
                                    sufficient rate.  <p>
                </menu>
                
                All of these factors depend on the complex and dynamic interplay of
                hydrological, geochemical, and biological processes within a geological
                medium that is spatially and temporally heterogeneous.  Knowledge of
                these coupled processes -- based on a fundamental understanding at the
                molecular, interfacial, and microbiological scales -- is necessary to
                assess natural biogeochemical processes and to harness them for either
                intrinsic or enhanced bioremediation.<p>
                <hr><h4><i>Scientists must evaluate how environmental factors
                interact to enhance or interfere with the survival, growth, and
                activity of the microbial community needed for
                bioremediation.</i></h4><hr>
                
                Over the past several decades, scientists have made significant progress
                toward understanding these processes and their interrelationships.  For example, the
                important role that speciation and complexation of metals and radionuclides play in
                their bioavailability and transport properties is now recognized.  Similarly, it is now
                recognized that geologic environments are heterogeneous on many scales: individual
                mineral grains, coatings on their surfaces, aggregates of several grains, and the
                macroscopic variations associated with varying depositional environments and post-depositional events (such as fracturing, faulting, and diagenetic alteration).  A basic
                understanding of the geochemistry of specific mixtures of organic chemicals and
                radionuclides, multiphase flow, transport and surface interactions of
                colloids/biocolloids, factors influencing bacterial transport, and the microbiology of
                deep geologic formations is also emerging.  Progress over the past decades provides
                an excellent foundation for future research in this area focused on issues crucial
                to bioremediation.<p>
                To improve the effectiveness of bioremediation, critical research is needed to:<p>
                <menu>
                
                1.  Develop methods to evaluate the spatial and temporal distribution at
                                    appropriate scales of microorganisms and specific microbial and rhizosphere
                                    communities that can biotransform, biodegrade, or detoxify contaminants of
                                    interest.<p>
               2.   Understand the processes and factors that contribute to the availability of
                                    nutrients and contaminants to the microbiota.<p>
               3.   Evaluate how environmental factors interact to enhance or interfere with
                                    survival, growth, and activity of the microbial community required to
                                    biodegrade, biotransform, or detoxify contaminant mixtures on a field scale.

                <h3>APPROACH</H3>
                
                
<HR>
To meet these critical research needs, the Biogeochemical Dynamics program is
closely tied to research in Community Dynamics and Microbial Ecology,
Biotransformation and Biodegradation, Assessment, Acceleration, and System
Integration, and will focus on three areas of scientific research:<p>
<menu>

1.              <b>Interfacial Phenomena. </b> Biogeochemical processes at liquid-liquid,
                liquid-solid, and gas-liquid interfaces.<p>
2.              <b>Contaminant and Nutrient Availability. </b> Chemical, physical, and
                biological factors affecting contaminant and nutrient availability.<p>
3.              <b>Spatial and Temporal Heterogeneity. </b> <i>In situ </i> spatial and
                temporal heterogeneity in microbial populations and communities, and
                physical and geochemical parameters and their interrelationships.  <p>
</menu>

Field and laboratory experiments will take place in parallel, using an iterative
process to identify key issues and track progress toward a field-scale understanding
of these processes and their role in bioremediation.  Intermediate-scale facilities will
be used for experiments to investigate processes not manifested at the laboratory
scale, such as hydrologic flow regimes and scaled heterogeneities.  The goals of
these experiments are (1) to provide a mechanistic understanding of coupled
physical, hydrological, geochemical, and microbiological processes and how
underlying molecular and interfacial phenomena and heterogeneities control
contaminant transport and availability and microbial movement at the field scale;
and (2) to develop a knowledge base sufficient to predict and manipulate the
influence of interfacial phenomena, contaminant and nutrient availability, and <i>in
situ </i> heterogeneities on the effectiveness of intrinsic and enhanced
bioremediation.  Information and results from these experiments will be closely
linked to the System Integration, Prediction, and Optimization element.<p>

Understand how to use information on natural heterogeneity in space and time and
geochemical transport processes in the effective design and deployment of <i>in
situ </i> bioremediation strategies.<p>
