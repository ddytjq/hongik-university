<P><B>(The latest version of this document is at 
<A HREF="http://www.milkywaygalaxy.freeservers.com">http://www.milkywaygalaxy.freeservers.com</A>. You may
want to check there for changes).</B>
<P>The purpose of this document is to provide you with a comprehensive list of
URL pointers and programming tips on C++.  Also, this document provides a
Java-like String class, string tokenizer, memory functions and many other
functions, which can be used in general C++ applications.
C++ and Java is often used concurrently in many software projects.
Programmers jump back and forth between C++ and Java will find this Java-like classes
very helpful.
Various examples are given which demonstrate the usage of this library and the Standard C++
Library.
<P>This document is not a textbook on C++, and there are already several
excellent on-line text books on the internet. Since C++ is being used for a long time
there are very large number of C++ documents/articles/tutorials on Internet. 
If you are new to C++ and you
never programmed in C++, then it is strongly suggested that you first either
read an online C++ textbook given in chapter 
<A HREF="C++Programming-HOWTO-13.html#onlinebooks">C++ Online Textbooks</A> or you buy a C++ book from online bookstores such as 
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</A> or 
<A HREF="http://www.barnesnoble.com">barnes</A>.
<P>As someone said - <I>Leave the C/C++ programming to system engineers who write
operating system, device drivers and fast response real-time programming, you should use 
Java/PHP-scripting as speed of the
computers in year 2005 will be several billion times faster than computers of year 2002!! </I>
Hardware is getting cheaper and faster.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Program in C++ ? C++ vs. Java/PHP</A>
</H2>

<P>C++ is one of the most powerful languages and will be used for a long time in
the future in spite of emergence of Java or PHP-scripting. 
Programs which need real-time ultra fast response use C/C++.
C++ runs <B>extremely fast</B>
and is in fact <B> 10 to 20 times FASTER than </B> Java.  
Java is the "offspring" of C++.
The only complaint against Java is - <I>"Java is GOD DAMN SLOW" </I>.
Java byte-code is slower when running in a VM than the equivalent natively compiled code.
Java runs faster with JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler, but it is still slower
than C++. And optimized C/C++ program is about <B>3 to 4 times faster</B>
than Java compiled to native code with JIT compiler or ahead-of-time compiler!! 
Then, why do people use Java? Because it is
pure object oriented and is easier to program in Java, as Java automates
memory management, and programmers do not directly deal with memory
allocations. This document attempts to automate the memory management in C++
to make it much more easy to use.  The library given here will make C++ look
like Java and will enable C++ to compete with the Java language.
<P>Because of manual memory allocations, debugging the C++ programs consumes a
major portion of time. This document will give you some better ideas and
tips to reduce the debugging time. 
<P>When should you use C++ and when you should use Java/PHP? 
<P>Bottom line is, you use C++:
<UL>
<LI> If you are developing a program where speed and performance is very important.</LI>
<LI> If the user base of your application or program is very large. Since C++
involves compile-link-debug cycle it is more time consuming to develop application in C++.
You can justify the cost only if the user base of your program is large enough.
Linking a large number of object files to create an executable takes time. (You can use
archives, libraries or shared libraries to reduce linking time).</LI>
<LI> If you have lot of experience programming in C++.</LI>
</UL>

Use Java/PHP:
<UL>
<LI> If speed and performance is not important (relative to C/C++).</LI>
<LI> Lower cost of development - There is no compile-link cycle, Java/PHP development is 
faster than C++.</LI>
<LI> Need rapid development.</LI>
<LI> You want no code maintenance nightmare. Maintaining C++ is more 
difficult than Java or PHP-scripting.</LI>
<LI> Java and PHP-scripting is the future, hardware speed will be zooming with the 
introduction of molecular, atomic 
and sub-atomic scale computers. Future computers will be several trillion times
faster than today's computer. Runtime performance of Java or PHP-script becomes less important as
speed of hardware zooms in future. The computers you are using
today (as of year 2002) are extremely slow and crawling and are not fast enough.</LI>
</UL>
<P>NOTE: There are lot of improvements in Java compilers (JIT and ahead-of-time). Java 
programs can be compiled with GNU GCJ 
<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/java">http://gcc.gnu.org/java</A>,
GCJ is a portable, optimizing, ahead-of-time compiler for the Java
programming language. It can compile - Java source code directly to native machine code, 
Java source code to Java bytecode (class files), 
and Java bytecode to native machine code.
<P>The Java native code compiler "gnu GCJ" is very rapidly maturing and in near future
everybody will be programming in Java instead of C++. Special optimizers in gnu GCJ
compiler can make Java programs as fast as C++ programs. The gnu GCJ compiler 
is 2-3 years away in becoming the de facto compiler on all platforms (initially on Linux
and then on MS Windows).
<P>GCJ resources:
<UL>
<LI> Main site GNU GCJ 
<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/java">http://gcc.gnu.org/java</A>,</LI>
<LI> Redhat rpm GNU GCJ 
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/apps/download">http://www.redhat.com/apps/download</A>. Go here and under the section "Find latest RPMs"
search by keyword 'gcc-java' and 'libgcj'.</LI>
<LI> Redhat GCJ Installation 
instructions 
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/devnet/articles/gcj.pdf">http://www.redhat.com/devnet/articles/gcj.pdf</A>
. In this document see also the "Usage of gnu GCJ", it gives some examples on howto
compile the Java programs using gcj (you MUST read the examples otherwise you will be
confused).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Which one Ada95, C, C++, Java or PHP?</A>
</H2>

<P>Language choice is very difficult. There are too many parameters - people,
people skills, cost, tools, politics (even national politics) and influence
of business-people/commercial companies.  The best language based on technical
merits does not get selected simply due to political decisions!
<P>See the language comparison chart of David Wheeler at
<A HREF="http://www.adahome.com/History/Steelman/steeltab.htm">Ada comparison chart</A>.
Ada got 93%, Java 72%, C++ 68% and C got 53%. C++ and Java 
are closer in points (only 4% difference).
Development costs of Ada is half of C++ as per
<A HREF="http://sw-eng.falls-church.va.us/AdaIC/docs/reports/cada/cada_art.html">Stephen F. Zeigler</A>.
Ada95 is available at -
<UL>
<LI> Ada home 
<A HREF="http://www.gnuada.org">http://www.gnuada.org</A>.</LI>
<LI> Google 
<A HREF="http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Programming/Languages/Ada">Ada index</A></LI>
</UL>
<P>The C++ compiler is lot more complex than a C compiler and C++ programs may
run bit slower than C programs. 
The C compiler is very mature and seasoned.
<P>On some system, you can use compiler options, to optimize the code
generated.
<P>Nowadays, C is primarily used for low level systems programming to develop
operating systems, device drivers and applications which must perform fast.
<P><B>Note: <I>Using the String, StringBuffer, StringTokenizer and
StringReader classes given in this howto, you can code in C++ which
"exactly" looks like Java.  Parts of this document tries to close the gap
between C++ and Java, by imitating Java classes in C++. Java programmers
who jump to and from C++ to Java will like this String class.</I></B>
<P>If you want to bypass the edit-compile-debug-compile cycle of C++ then see
scripting languages like PHP which can be used for web development and for
general purpose programming.  Scripting languages like PHP and PERL enable
rapid application development. PHP has some features of object-oriented
programming. PHP is at 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/PHP-HOWTO.html">http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/PHP-HOWTO.html</A>. 
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Problems facing the current C++ compilers</A>
</H2>

<P>Since C++ is a super-set of C, it has all the "bad" features of C.
Manual allocation and deallocation of memory is tedious and error prone 
(see 
<A HREF="C++Programming-HOWTO-9.html#garbage">Garbage Collector for C++</A>).
<P>In C programming - memory leaks, memory overflows are very common due
to usage of features like -
<HR>
<PRE>
        Datatype  char * and char[]
        String functions like strcpy, strcat, strncpy, strncat, etc..
        Memory functions like malloc, realloc, strdup, etc..
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>The usage of <B>char *</B> and <B>strcpy</B> causes <I>horrible</I> memory 
problems due to <I>"overflow"</I>, 
<I>"fence past errors"</I>, <I>"memory corruption"</I>, <I>"step-on-others-toe"</I> 
(hurting other variable's memory locations) or  <I>"memory leaks"</I>.
The memory problems are extremely hard to debug and are 
very time consuming to fix and trouble-shoot. Memory problems bring down
the productivity of programmers. This document helps increase the
productivity of programmers via different methods addressed to solve the
memory defects in C++.
Memory related bugs are very tough to crack, and even experienced programmers 
take several days or weeks to debug memory related problems. Memory 
bugs may hide inside the code for several months and can cause unexpected
program crashes. The memory bugs due to usage of
<B>char *</B> and <B>pointers</B> in C/C++  
is costing $2 billion 
every year in time lost due to debugging and downtime of programs. If you use
<B>char *</B> and <B>pointers</B> 
in C++ then it is a very costly affair, especially if your program size is greater 
than 10,000 lines of code.
<P>Hence, the following techniques are proposed to overcome the faults of C.
Give preference in the following order -
<OL>
<LI> Use references instead of pointers.</LI>
<LI> Java style String class (given in this HOWTO) or the string class from the Standard C++ Library.</LI>
<LI> Character pointers (char *) in C++ <B>limit the usage</B> of char * to cases where you
cannot use the String class.</LI>
<LI> Character pointers (char *) in C using extern linkage specification, if you
do not want to use (char *) in C++.</LI>
</OL>
<P>To use "C char *", you would put 
all your C programs in a separate file and link to C++ programs using 
the <I>linkage-specification</I> statement <B>extern "C" </B> -
<HR>
<PRE>
extern "C" {
#include &lt;some_c_header.h>
}

extern "C" {
    comp();
    some_c_function();
}
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>The <B>extern "C"</B> is a linkage specification and is a flag that 
everything within the enclosing block (brace-surrounded) uses C linkage,
not C++ linkage. 
<P>The <B>'String class'</B> utilizes the constructor and destructor features
to automate memory management and provides access to functions like
<I>ltrim</I>, <I>substring</I>, etc.. 
<P>See also related 
<A HREF="C++Programming-HOWTO-7.html#standard-string">string class</A> in your C++
compiler.  The <B>string class</B> is part of the Standard C++ Library
library and provides many string manipulation functions. 
<P>Because the C++ <B>'string class'</B> and <B>'String class'</B> library
provides many string manipulation functions, there is less need to use the
character pointer approach to write your own string functions.  Also, C++
programmers must be encouraged to use 'new', 'delete' operators instead of
using 'malloc' or 'free'.
<P>Both string classes do everything that <B>char *</B> or <B>char []</B>
do. One of the added benefits is that you do not have to worry about the
memory problems and memory allocation at all.
