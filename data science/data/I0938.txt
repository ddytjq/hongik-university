But only the collaboration between Foster &amp; Partners and HOK LOBB Sports Architecture really was a Dream Team.<br>										</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#3e2447"><b><br>										&quot;Our intention was to form a world-beating team,&quot;</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#3e2447"> says Ben Vickery, vice president of HOK LOBB Sports Architecture and now a Wembley project director. The team combines the abilities of the world's leading sports architects with an internationally famous practice, led by the helicopter-flying Norman Foster, now Lord Foster of Thames Bank. He could be seen as the architectural equivalent of Sir Alex Ferguson, combining style with steel, fine skill with rigour and discipline, to produce high-earning, world-beating results.<br>										<br>										As you would expect, Foster is very clear in his ambitions for the new Wembley Stadium: he wants to create nothing less than a <b>&quot;cathedral of football&quot;</b>. <br>										<br>										<b>&quot;Physically, the new building is much larger than the original. The immediate reaction to that might be 'oh my God', but the experience of the stadium will lead to a very different reaction. The best quality of the original stadium is its intimacy, but the new stadium will feel more intimate because there's no athletics track. Being in the new stadium is also a more civilised experience for the fan - we are bringing facilities up to an incredible standard of luxury.&quot;</b><br>										<br>										<!-- The final match at the current Wembley Stadium will be, appropriately enough, England versus Germany. A match so resonant with the history of the last century is a fitting end for the stadium that, in some ways, has followed the fortunes of the English nation since its completion in 1923. Even its original name, the Empire Stadium, speaks volumes about its illustrious origins.<br>										<br -->										But these origins and the stadium's subsequent glorious history do not overwhelm the design team. <b>&quot;It's not daunting at all,&quot;</b> enthuses Ken Shuttleworth of Foster &amp; Partners. <b>&quot;Actually, it's very exciting. Designing a new stadium for Wembley is something we've always wanted to do?  We chased the job for many years. It's a passion for us. Most people in the office support football. I've got people queuing up to work on the project.&quot;</b><br>										<br>										<b>&quot;The history is challenging,&quot;</b> adds Lord Foster. <b>&quot;Of course, the old stadium commands enormous respect, but you can't let it overawe you. Otherwise you become paralysed, compromised and ineffective. The challenge is to respond to obsolescence and strive to create something better than before. We have put a lot into understanding the previous building and what it means, but the only dynamic is change. That applies as much to football as it does to buildings or anything else.&quot;</b><br>										<br>										Controversially, the world-famous twin towers will be absent. According to Ken Shuttleworth, the design team started out working on the principle that the towers would stay. <b>&quot;All the early design drawings included the towers, but we eventually decided that they would look stupid and entirely lose their significance,&quot;</b> he says. <b>&quot;Against the scale of the new building they would be like little pepperpots.&quot;</b><br>										<br>										Instead the design team has decided to give the new Wembley a new landmark, to help it forge a new, forward-looking identity: a 133m-high arch, soaring above the stadium and across the north London skyline. Shuttleworth believes that arches hold particular associations throughout history that are perfect for Wembley. <b>&quot;Arches have a feeling of celebration and permanence,&quot;</b> he says. <b>&quot;They are also seen as a gateway.&quot;</b><br>										<br>										Wembley's arch will perform dual functions, structural and visual. Structurally, the arch will support the stadium's sliding roof; visually it will be a startling landmark on London's skyline. Lord Foster calls it <b>&quot;a more powerful and evocative equivalent of the twin towers&quot;</b>. Shuttleworth adds: <b>&quot;The arch will become the Wembley icon of the 21st century. It will be one of the most exciting structures in the world&quot;</b>.<br>										<br>										This is an abridged version of one of the exciting features included in the <a href="launch.htm">Launch Issue</a> of Wembley Magazine.<br>										</font></td>								</tr>								<tr>									<td width="180" align="left" valign="bottom">										<div align="left">										  <a href="http://www.thefa.com/" target="_blank"><img src="../images/team/crest_nt.gif" border="0" hspace="52" vspace="8" width="59" height="70"></a><br><font size="1" face="Verdana" color="#3e2447">For England fixtures and ticket information</font><font size="1" face="Verdana" color="#9fe39f"> </font><a href="http://www.thefa.com/" target="_blank"><font size="1" face="Verdana">please click here...<br></font></a> 										</div>									</td>									<td width="77" align="left" valign="bottom"></td>									<td width="443" align="left" valign="bottom">										<div align="left">											<font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#3e2447">You are in <a href="intro.htm">WEMBLEY MAGAZINE</a> &gt; DREAM TEAM &gt; <a href="#top">back to top</a></font></div>									</td>								</tr>							</table>							<br>							<font color="#d1bdd7"><br>							</font><font face="Verdana" color="#3e2447" size="1">dedication by</font><font face="Verdana" color="#d1c186" size="1"> </font><a href="http://www.zestmedia.com" target="_blank"><font face="Verdana" size="1">zestmedia.com</font></a><br>							<br>						</div>					</td>				</tr>			</table>		</center>	</body></html>
