<A NAME="BBevidence"><H2>What is the evidence for the Big Bang?</H2>

<P>
The evidence for the Big Bang comes from many pieces of 
<A HREF="./cosmo_01.htm#CO">observational data</A>
that are consistent with the Big Bang.  None of these <EM>prove</EM> the
Big Bang, since scientific theories are not proven.  Many of these facts
are consistent with the Big Bang and some other cosmological models,
but taken together these observations show that the Big Bang is the
best current model for the Universe.  These observations include:
<UL>
<LI>The darkness of the night sky -
<A HREF="http://www.weburbia.com/physics/olber.html">Olbers' paradox</A>.
<LI>The Hubble Law - the linear distance vs redshift law.  The data are now
very good.
<LI>Homogeneity - fair data showing that our location in the Universe 
is not special.
<LI>Isotropy - very strong data showing that the sky looks the same in all 
directions to 1 part in 100,000.
<LI><A HREF="#TD">Time dilation in supernova light curves.</A>
</UL>
The observations listed above are consistent with the Big Bang or with the
Steady State model, but many observations support the Big Bang over the
<A HREF="./stdystat.htm">Steady State:</A>
<UL>
<LI>Radio source and quasar counts vs. flux.  These show that the Universe
has evolved.
<LI>Existence of the blackbody 
<A HREF="./glossary.html#CMB">CMB</A>.  This shows that the Universe has
evolved from a dense, isothermal state.
<LI>Variation of 
<A HREF="./stdystat.htm#Tvsz">T<SUB>CMB</SUB> with redshift</A>.
This is a direct observation of the evolution of the Universe.
<LI>Deuterium, <SUP>3</SUP>He, <SUP>4</SUP>He, and <SUP>7</SUP>Li
abundances.  These light isotopes are all well fit by 
<A HREF="./BBNS.html">
predicted reactions</A> 
occurring in the <A HREF="./cosmobib.html#TF3M">First Three Minutes.</A>
</UL>
Finally, the <A HREF="./CMB-DT.html">angular power spectrum of the 
CMB anisotropy</A> that does exist
at the several parts per million level is consistent with a dark matter
dominated Big Bang model that went through the inflationary scenario.

<A NAME="CC"><H2>Why do we think that the expansion of the Universe
is accelerating?</H2>

<P>
The evidence for an accelerating expansion comes from observations of the 
<A HREF="./sne_cosmology.html">brightness of distant supernovae.</A>
We observe the <A HREF="./doppler.htm">redshift</A> of a supernova
which tells us by what the factor the Universe has expanded since the
supernova exploded.  
This factor is <EM>(1+z)</EM>, where <EM>z</EM> is the redshift.
But in order to determine the expected brightness
of the supernova, we need to know its <A HREF="#DN">distance now</A>.
If the expansion of the Universe is accelerating
due to a <A HREF="./cosmo_constant.html">cosmological constant</A>,
then the expansion was slower in the past,
and thus the time required to expand by a given factor
is longer, and the distance NOW is larger.
But if the expansion is decelerating, it was faster in the past
and the distance NOW is smaller.  Thus for an accelerating expansion the
supernovae at high redshifts will appear to be fainter than they would
for a decelerating expansion because their
current distances are larger.
Note that these distances are all proportional to the age of the
Universe [or 1/<A HREF="./glossary.html#H0">H<SUB>o</SUB></A>],
but this dependence cancels out when the brightness of a nearby supernova at
<EM>z</EM> close to 0.1 is compared to a distant supernova with <EM>z</EM>
close to 1.
</P>

<P><A HREF="#top">Back to top.</A></P>

<A NAME="fifth"><H2>What is quintessence?</H2>

<P>
Quintessence, or the fifth essence, is a fifth element beyond the standard
earth, air, fire and water of ancient chemistry.
Steinhardt and colleagues have adopted quintessence as the name for a 
particular model for the vacuum energy which causes the accelerating
expansion of the Universe.
A search of astro-ph on the LANL preprint server
<A HREF="http://arXiv.org">XXX</A> for "quintessence" in the abstract
hits over 100 articles of which the
<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9804015">oldest</A> dates from
1998.

<P><A HREF="#top">Back to top.</A></P>

<A NAME="ct2"><H2>If the Universe is only 10 billion years old,
why isn't the most distant object we can see 5 billion light years
away?</H2>

<P>
This question makes some hidden assumptions about space and time which
are not consistent with all definitions of distance and time.  
One assumes that all the galaxies left from a single point at the Big
Bang, and the most distant one traveled away from us for half the age of
the Universe at almost the speed of light, and then emitted light which
came back to us at the speed of light.  By assuming constant velocities,
we must ignore gravity, so this would only happen in a nearly empty
Universe.  In the empty Universe, one of the many possible definitions
of distance does agree with the assumptions in this question: the
<EM>angular size distance</EM>, and it does reach a maximum value of
the speed of light times one half the age of the Universe.
See <A HREF="./cosmo_02.htm#MD">
Part 2</A> of the cosmology tutorial for a discussion of the other kinds
of distances which go to infinity in the empty Universe model since
this gives an unbounded Universe.
</P>

<P><A HREF="#top">Back to top.</A></P>

<A NAME="DN"><H2>If the Universe is only 10 billion years old,
how can we see objects that are now 30 billion light years away?</H2>

<P>
When talking about the distance of a moving object, we
mean the spatial separation NOW, with the positions of
both objects specified at the current time.  In an
expanding Universe this distance NOW is larger than the
speed of light times the light travel time due to the
increase of separations between objects as the Universe
expands.  This is not do to any change in the units of
space and time, but just caused by things being farther
apart now than they used to be.
</P>

<P>
What is the distance NOW to the most distant thing we can
see?  Let's take the age of the Universe to be 10 billion
years.  In that time light travels 10 billion light
years, and some people stop here.  But the distance has
grown since the light traveled.  The average time when
the light was traveling was 5 billion years ago.  For the
<A HREF="./glossary.html#CD">critical density</A> case,
the scale factor for the Universe goes like
the 2/3 power of the time since the Big Bang, so the
Universe has grown by a factor of 2<SUP>2/3</SUP> = 1.59 since
the midpoint of the light's trip.  But the size of the
Universe changes continuously, so we should divide the
light's trip into short intervals.  First take two
intervals: 5 billion years at an average time 7.5 billion
years after the Big Bang, which gives 5 billion light
years that have grown by a factor of 1/(0.75)<SUP>2/3</SUP> =
1.21, plus another 5 billion light years at an average
time 2.5 billion years after the Big Bang, which has grown
by a factor of 4<SUP>2/3</SUP> = 2.52.  Thus with 1 interval we
got 1.59*10 = 15.9 billion light years, while with two
intervals we get 5*(1.21+2.52) = 18.7 billion light
years.  With 8192 intervals we get 29.3 billion light
years.  In the limit of very many time intervals we get
30 billion light years.  With calculus this whole paragraph
reduces to <A HREF="./horizon-eq.gif">this.</A>
</P>

<P>
Another way of seeing this is to consider a photon and a galaxy 30
billion light years away from us now, 10 billion years after the Big
Bang.  The distance of this photon satisfies D = 3ct.
If we wait for 0.1 billion years, the Universe will grow by a
factor of (10.1/10)<SUP>2/3</SUP> = 1.0066, so the galaxy will be
1.0066*30 = 30.2 billion light years away.  But the light will have
traveled 0.1 billion light years further than the galaxy
<EM>because it moves at the speed of light relative to the matter in its
vicinity</EM>
and will thus be at D = 30.3 billion light years, so D = 3ct is still
satisfied.
</P>

<P>
If the Universe does not have the critical density then
the distance is different, and for the low densities that
are more likely the distance NOW to the most distant
object we can see is bigger than 3 times the speed of
light times the age of the Universe.
</P>

<P><A HREF="#top">Back to top.</A></P>

<A NAME="age"><H2>How can the oldest stars in the Universe be older than
the Universe?</H2>

<P>
Of course the Universe has to be older than the oldest stars in it.  So this
question basically asks: which estimate is wrong -
<UL>
<LI>The age of the Universe
<LI>The age of the oldest stars
<LI>Both
</UL>
The age of the Universe is determined from its expansion rate: the
<A HREF="./cosmo_01.htm#CO">Hubble constant</A>, 
which is the ratio of the radial velocity of a
distant galaxy to its distance.  The <A HREF="./doppler.htm">radial
velocity</A> is easy to measure, but the <A
HREF="./distance.htm">distances</A> are not.  Thus there is currently a
15% uncertainty in the Hubble constant.
</P>

<P>
Determining the <A HREF="./age.html">age</A> of the oldest stars
requires a knowledge of their luminosity, which depends on their
distance.  This leads to a 25% uncertainty in the ages of the oldest
stars due to the difficulty in determining distances.
</P>

<P>
Thus the discrepancy between the age of the oldest things in the
Universe and the age inferred from the expansion rate is within the
current margin of error.  In fact,
in 1997 improved distances from the HIPPARCOS satellite suggested
that this discrepancy has vanished.
</P>

<P><A HREF="#top">Back to top.</A></P>

<A NAME="FTL"><H2>Can objects move away from us faster than the speed of
light?</H2>

<P>
Again, this is a question that depends on which of the
<A HREF="./cosmo_02.htm#MD">many distance definitions</A> one uses.
However, if we assume that the distance of an object at time <EM>t</EM>
is the distance from our position at time
<EM>t</EM> to the object's position at time <EM>t</EM>
measured by a set of observers moving with
the expansion of the Universe, and all making their observations when
they see the Universe as having age <EM>t</EM>, then the velocity
(change in <EM>D</EM> per change in <EM>t</EM>) can definitely be larger
than the speed of light.  This is not a contradiction of special
<A HREF="./relatvty.htm">relativity</A> because this distance is not the
same as the spatial distance used in SR, and the age of the Universe is
not the same as the time used in SR.
In the special case of the empty Universe, where one can show
the model in both <A HREF="./cosmo_02.htm#MD">special relativistic and
cosmological coordinates</A>, the velocity defined by
change in cosmological distance per unit cosmic time is given by
<EM>
v = c ln(1+z)
</EM>
which clearly goes to <EM>infinity</EM> as the redshift goes to
infinity, and is larger than c for <EM>z &gt; 1.718</EM>.  
For the critical density Universe, this velocity is given
by
<EM>
v = 2c[1-(1+z)<SUP>-0.5</SUP>]
</EM>
which is larger than c for <EM>z &gt; 3 </EM>.
</P>

<P><A HREF="#top">Back to top.</A></P>

<A NAME="z"><H2>What is the redshift?</H2>

<P>The <A HREF="./doppler.htm">redshift</A> of an object is the 
amount by which the spectral lines
in the source are shifted to the red.  That is, the wavelengths get longer.
To be precise, the redshift is given by
<PRE>
z = [WL(obs)-WL(em)]/WL(em)
</PRE>
where WL(em) is the emitted wavelength of a line, which is known from 
laboratory measurements, and WL(obs) is the observed wavelength of the line.
In an expanding Universe, distant objects are redshifted, with
<EM>z = H<SUB>o</SUB> D/c</EM> for small distances.  This law was
discovered by Hubble and H<SUB>o</SUB> is known as the Hubble constant.

<A NAME="QZ"><H2>Are quasars really at the large distances indicated by
their redshifts?</H2>

<P>
The short answer is<BR>
<CENTER><H1>Yes!</H1></CENTER>
</P>

<P>
<A
HREF="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1978ApJ...223..747S&db_key=AST&high=3325b47acc08258">
Stockton (1978, ApJ, 223, 747)</A> 
observed faint galaxies near in the sky to bright quasars at
moderate redshifts.  He chose quasars with moderate redshifts so he
would still be able to see galaxies at the redshift of the quasar.  He
found that a good fraction of the redshifts of the faint galaxies agreed
with the redshifts of the quasars.  In other words, quasars are
associated with galaxies that have the same redshift as the quasar and
have just the brightness expected if the quasars are at their
cosmological distances.  Thus at least some quasars are at the distance
indicated by their redshifts, and this includes some of the most
luminous quasars: for example
<A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap951023.html">3C273</A>.
Thus the simple answer selected by Occam's razor is that all quasars are
at the distances indicated by their redshifts.
</P>

<P>
A further argument in favor of cosmological redshifts for quasars is
the essentially perfect rank ordering implied by the fact that
quasar absorption line system always have redshifts less than or equal
to the quasar emission line redshift.
In gravitational lens systems, the redshift of the lens is always less than
the redshift of the lensed object.
Thus intervening systems like lensing galaxies or absorbing clouds, which
obviously have smaller distances than the quasars, also have smaller
redshifts.

<P>The statistical arguments advanced by Arp and others in favor of
anomalous quasar redshifts are often

<A NAME="SQ"><H2>What about objects with discordant redshifts, like
Stephan's Quintet?</H2>

One famous example of objects with different redshifts appearing in the
same part of the sky is <A
HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap961213.html">Stephan's
Quintet</A>.  But the low redshift galaxy (in the lower left) is
obviously more resolved into stars and looks "bumpier".  By the
surface brightness fluctuation method of 
<A HREF="./distance.htm#SBF">distance</A> determination, this bumpiness
means that the low redshift galaxy is indeed much closer to us than the
other four members of the quintet.

<A NAME="TD"><H2>Has the time dilation of distant source light curves
predicted by the Big Bang been observed?</H2>

<P>
This time dilation is a consequence of the standard interpretation of
the redshift:  a supernova that takes 20 days to decay will appear to
take 40 days to decay when observed at redshift z=1.
The time dilation has been observed, with 5 different published measurements
of this effect in supernova light curves.  These papers are:

<A NAME="MX"><H2>Are galaxies really moving away from us or is space just
expanding?</H2>

<P>
This depends on how you measure things, or your choice of coordinates.
In one view, the spatial positions of galaxies are changing, and this
causes the redshift.  In another view, the galaxies are at fixed
coordinates, but the distance between fixed points increases with time,
and this causes the redshift.  General relativity explains how to
transform from one view to the other, and the observable effects like
the redshift are the same in both views.

space-time diagrams for the Universe drawn in both ways.

<A NAME="SS"><H2>Why doesn't the Solar System expand if the whole Universe
is expanding?</H2>

<P>
This question is best answered in the coordinate system where the
galaxies change their positions.  The galaxies are receding from us
because they started out receding from us, and the force of gravity just
causes an acceleration that causes them to slow down.  Planets are going
around the Sun is fixed size orbits because they are bound to the Sun.
Everything is just moving under the influence of Newton's laws
(with very slight modifications due to relativity).
<A HREF="./bound.html">[Illustration]</A>
For the technically minded,
<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9803097">Cooperstock
<EM>et al.</EM></A> computes that the influence of the cosmological
expansion on the Earth's orbit around the Sun amounts to
a growth by only one part in a septillion over the age of the Solar System.
This effect is caused by the cosmological background density within the 
Solar System going down as the Universe expands, which may or may not happen
depending on the nature of the dark matter.
The mass loss of the Sun due to its luminosity and the Solar wind leads to
a much larger [but still tiny] growth of the Earth's orbit which has nothing
to do with the expansion of the Universe.
Even on the much larger (million light year) scale of clusters of
galaxies, the effect of the expansion of the Universe is 10 million
times smaller than the gravitational binding of the cluster.

<A NAME="FLAT"><H2>What is meant by a flat Universe?</H2>

<P>
The Universe appears to be homogeneous and isotropic, and there are only
three possible geometries that are homogeneous and isotropic as shown in
<A HREF="./cosmo_03.htm">Part 3</A>.  A flat space has 
<A
HREF="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Euclid.html">
Euclidean</A> geometry,
where the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180<SUP>o</SUP>.  
A curved space has
<A

non-Euclidean geometry</A>.
In a
positively curved, or hyperspherical space, the sum of the angles in a
triangle is bigger than 180<SUP>o</SUP>, and this angle excess gives the
area of the triangle divided by the square of the radius of the surface. 
In a negatively curved or
hyperbolic space, the sum of the angles in a triangle is less than
180<SUP>o</SUP>.

this non-Euclidean geometry he actually tried
measuring a large triangle, but he got an angle sum of 180<SUP>o</SUP>
because the radius of the Universe is very large (if not infinite) so
the angle excess or deficit has to be tiny for any triangle we can measure.
If the radius is infinite, then the Universe is flat.

<A NAME="XIN"><H2>What is the Universe expanding into?</H2>

<P>
This question is based on the ever popular misconception that
the Universe is some curved object embedded in a higher dimensional
space, and that the Universe is expanding into this space.
This misconception is probably fostered by the
<A HREF="./balloon0.html">balloon</A> analogy which shows a 2-D spherical
model of the Universe expanding in a 3-D space.  While it is possible
to think of the Universe this way, it is not necessary, <EM>and there
is nothing whatsoever that we have measured or can measure that will
show us anything about the larger space.</EM>  Everything that we
measure is within the Universe, and we see no edge or boundary or center
of expansion.  Thus the Universe is not expanding into <EM>anything</EM>
that we can see, and this is not a profitable thing to think about.

the surface of a 4-D cube,
remember that the balloon analogy is just a 2-D picture of a 3-D
situation that is supposed to help you think about a curved 3-D space,
but it does not mean that there is really a 4-D space that the Universe
is expanding into.

<A NAME="BBB"><H2>What came before the Big Bang?</H2>

<P>
The standard Big Bang model is <EM>singular</EM> at the time of the Big Bang,
<EM>t = 0</EM>.  This means that one cannot even define time, since spacetime
is singular.
In some models like the chaotic or perpetual inflation favored by
Linde, the Big Bang is just one of many inflating bubbles in a spacetime
foam.  But there is no possibility of getting information from outside
our own one bubble.  Thus I conclude that: <A

<A NAME="OP"><H2>Why is the sky dark at night?</H2>

If the Universe were infinitely old, and infinite in extent, and stars
could shine forever, then every direction you looked would eventually
end on the surface of a star, and the whole sky would be as bright as
the surface of the Sun.  This is known as
<A HREF="http://www.weburbia.com/physics/olber.html">Olbers' 
Paradox</A> after Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers [1757-1840] who wrote about it
in 1823-1826 but it was also discussed earlier.  
Absorption by interstellar dust does not circumvent this paradox, since dust
reradiates whatever radiation it absorbs within a few minutes, which is
much less than the age of the Universe.  However, the Universe is not
infinitely old, and the expansion of the Universe reduces the
accumulated energy radiated by distant stars.  Either one of these
effects acting alone would solve Olbers' Paradox, but they both act at
once.

<A NAME="BC"><H2>Will the Universe expand forever or recollapse?</H2>

This depends on the ratio of the density of the Universe
to the critical density.  If the density is higher than the critical
density the Universe will recollapse in a <EM>Big Crunch</EM>.
But current data suggests that the density is less than or equal to the
critical density so the Universe will expand forever.

<A NAME="EBC"><H2>Does entropy prevent a Big Crunch?</H2>

<P>
The issue of entropy in the Universe is subtle and not entirely
settled.  Theorists are still trying to work out what happens to the
entropy of matter that falls into a black hole, a problem which
involves both quantum mechanics and strong gravity.  When a successful
theory of quantum gravity is worked out, it should explain why the
Universe came out of the Big Bang singularity with a very large
entropy, and what happens to the entropy of the Universe if it
recollapses.
</P><P>
Entropy is related to the number of ways a system can be in a given state
or condition.  Thus a shuffled deck of cards has a higher entropy than a
new deck with all the suits in order.  Adding energy to a system usually
opens up more states, and increases the entropy.  The temperature of a
system is defined such that kT is the amount of energy needed to increase
the number of available states by a factor of e = 2.71828...  where k is
Boltzmann's constant.  Transferring heat from a hot piece of a system to a
cold piece increases the number of ways to arrange the cold part by a
larger factor than the decrease in the number of ways to arrange the hot
piece.  Thus the normal flow of heat from hot to cold causes an increase
in the number of ways the whole system can be arranged which is then an
increase in the total entropy of the whole system.
</P><P>
Entropy need not always increase in open systems.  Energy could be used to
make entropy decrease for a particular system.  Your refrigerator
does this by removing heat from the interior, if you consider the interior
of your refrigerator to be a separate system.  Of course, if you consider
both the internal and external portions of the refrigerator then there is
a net increase of entropy due to the inefficiency of the refrigerator.
</P><P>
Since entropy is a statistical concept, short term fluctuations in small
systems can allow entropy to decrease.
</P><P>
Entropy remains constant in a system with a uniform temperature that has
no heat added or subtracted from it.  This is thought to be more or less
the case for the Universe or for any representative piece of the Universe
that expands or contracts in the same way the Universe does. The vast
majority of the entropy of the Universe is in the cosmic microwave
background radiation because the vast majority of particles in the
Universe are the photons of the 
<A HREF="./glossary.html#CMB">CMB</A>.  As the Universe expands, the
temperature of the radiation drops to maintain constant entropy. If the
Universe were to collapse at some point, the radiation would heat back up
to maintain constant entropy.  When the Universe expanded the radiation
started out in thermal equilibrium with the matter and then de-coupled.  
In the collapse the radiation and the matter would once again come into
thermal equilibrium.  Whatever happened with the dynamics of the matter in
the interim would be reflected in the final thermal equilibrium with the
radiation.  The final entropy of the Universe as it approaches the Big
Crunch singularity would be larger than the initial entropy of the
Universe because of the heat added by nuclear fusion in stars, so a
recollapse does not involve a decrease in entropy.

<A NAME="OSC"><H2>What about the oscillating Universe?</H2>

If the Universe recollapses, then there is another singularity at the
time of the Big Crunch.  A singularity means that the laws of physics
break down, so we have no way to predict whether the Big Crunch will
connect to another cycle of expansion.  Even if the density were high
enough to cause a recollapse, there would be no guarantee that
the Universe would oscillate.  But the current evidence is strongly
against any recollapse, which would rule out the oscillating
Universe.  See <A

<A NAME="DM"><H2>What is the dark matter?</H2>

<P>When astronomers add up the masses and luminosities of the stars near
the Sun, they find that there are about 3 solar masses for every 1 solar
luminosity.  When they measure the total mass of clusters of galaxies
and compare that to the total luminosity of the clusters, they find
about 300 solar masses for every solar luminosity.  Evidently most of
the mass in the Universe is dark.  If the Universe has the critical
density then there are about 1000 solar masses for every solar
luminosity, so an even greater fraction of the Universe is dark matter.
But the theory of 
<A HREF="./BBNS.html">Big
Bang nucleosynthesis</A> says that the density of
ordinary matter (<EM>anything made from atoms</EM>) can be at most 10% of
the critical density, so the majority of the Universe does not emit
light, does not scatter light, does not absorb light, and is not even
made out of atoms.  It can only be "seen" by its gravitational effects.
This <A HREF="./glossary.html#non-baryonic">"non-baryonic"</A>
dark matter can be <A HREF="./neutrinos.html">neutrinos</A>, if they have small
masses instead of being massless, or it can be WIMPs (Weakly Interacting
Massive Particles), or it could be primordial black holes.  My nominee
for the "least likely to be caught" award goes to hypothetical stable
Planck mass remnants of primordial black holes that have evaporated due
to Hawking radiation.  The Hawking radiation from the not-yet evaporated
primordial black holes may be detectable by future 
<A HREF="./glossary.html#gamma-ray">gamma ray</A> telescopes,
but the 20 microgram remnants would be very hard to detect.
