<P>
 As an example of the equations to be solved, we outline briefly the
Einstein and Boltzmann equations for massive neutrinos, taken from
the more detailed derivation in
<A HREF="sc95bib.html">Ma and Bertschinger (1995)</A>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00010000000000000000>1. Line Element</A></H3>
<P>
The code is only for spatially flat (<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig101.gif">) background spacetimes
with isentropic scalar metric perturbations.  The spacetime
coordinates are denoted by <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig102.gif">; repeated indices are summed.  Since
our interests lie in the physics in an expanding universe, we use
comoving coordinates <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig103.gif"> with the expansion
factor <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig104.gif"> of the universe factored out.  The comoving
coordinates are related to the proper time and positions
<EM>t</EM>

and
<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig105.gif"> by <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig106.gif">, <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig107.gif">.
Dots will denote derivatives with respect to <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig108.gif">: <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig109.gif">.
The conformal Newtonian gauge (also known as the longitudinal gauge)
is a particularly simple gauge to use
for the scalar mode of metric perturbations.  The perturbations are
characterized by two scalar potentials <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig110.gif"> and <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig111.gif"> which appear
in the line element as
<P><A NAME=conformal>&#160;</A><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig112.gif"><P>
One advantage of this gauge is that <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig113.gif"> plays the role of the
gravitational potential in the Newtonian limit and thus has a simple
physical interpretation.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00020000000000000000>2. Gravity</A></H3>
<P>
The conformal Newtonian gauge gravitational potentials in equation (1) 
obey equations similar to the classical Poisson equation:
<P><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig114.gif"><P>
<P><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig115.gif"><P>
Here, <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig116.gif"> and <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig117.gif"> are the spatial average density and
pressure, <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig118.gif"> is the density fluctuation,
<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig119.gif"> is a potential for the momentum density <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig120.gif">,
and <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig121.gif"> is a potential for the shear stress tensor <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig122.gif">.
In the Newtonian limit, the momentum density, pressure, and shear stress
are negligible compared with the density.  However, we must use the fully
relativistic equations since important gravitational contributions are
made by photons and massless neutrinos.  To get these, we must calculate
the energy-momentum tensor components for these species.  This is done
starting from a phase space description.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00030000000000000000>3. Phase Space</A></H3>
<P>
A phase space is described by six variables: three positions <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig123.gif"> and
their conjugate momenta <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig124.gif">.
The conjugate momentum has the property that it is simply the spatial
part of the 4-momentum with lower indices, i.e., for a particle of mass
<EM>m</EM>, <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig125.gif"> where <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig126.gif">.
The phase space distribution of the particles gives the
number of particles in a differential volume <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig127.gif"> in phase space:   
<P><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig128.gif"><P>
The zeroth-order phase space distribution is the
Fermi-Dirac distribution for fermions (+ sign) and the Bose-Einstein
distribution for bosons (- sign):
<P><A NAME=equildist>&#160;</A><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig129.gif"><P>
where <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig130.gif">, <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig131.gif">
denotes the temperature of the particles today, the factor <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig132.gif"> is the
number of spin degrees of freedom, and <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig133.gif"> and <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig134.gif"> are
the Planck and the Boltzmann constants.
<P>
It is convenient to replace
<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig135.gif"> by <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig136.gif"> in order to eliminate the metric perturbations
from the definition of the momenta.  Moreover, we shall write the
comoving 3-momentum <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig137.gif"> in terms of its magnitude and direction:
<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig138.gif"> where <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig139.gif">.  Thus, we change our
phase space variables, replacing <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig140.gif"> by <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig141.gif">.
It is also convenient to write the phase space distribution as a
zeroth-order distribution plus a perturbed piece in
the new variables

<EM>q</EM>
and <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig142.gif">:
<P><A NAME=fpert>&#160;</A><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig143.gif"><P><H3><A NAME=SECTION00040000000000000000>4. Boltzmann equation</A></H3>
<P>
The phase space distribution evolves according to the Boltzmann equation.
In terms of our variables <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig144.gif"> this is
<P><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig145.gif"><P>
where the right-hand side involves terms due to collisions,
whose form depends on the type of particle interactions involved.
Since <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig146.gif">
is also a first-order quantity, the term <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig147.gif"> in the Boltzmann equation can be neglected to first
order.  Then the Boltzmann equation in 

<EM>k</EM>-space
can be written as
<P><A NAME=boltcon>&#160;</A><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig148.gif"><P>
<P>
The terms in the Boltzmann equation depend on the direction of the
momentum <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig149.gif"> only through its angle with <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig150.gif">.
Therefore, if the
momentum-dependence of the initial phase space perturbation is axially
symmetric about <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig151.gif">, it will remain axially symmetric.  
If axially-asymmetric perturbations in the neutrinos or other
collisionless particles are produced, they would generate no scalar
metric perturbations and thus would have no effect on other species.
Therefore, we shall assume that the initial momentum-dependence is
axially symmetric so that <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig152.gif"> depends on <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig153.gif"> only
through 

<EM>q</EM>
and <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig154.gif">.  This assumption, which
effectively reduces the dimensionality of phase space perturbations by
one.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00050000000000000000>5. Massive Neutrinos</A></H3>
<P>
Massive neutrinos also obey the collisionless Boltzmann equation.
The evolution of the distribution function for massive neutrinos
is, however, complicated by their nonzero mass.
<P>
The perturbation <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig155.gif"> is expanded directly in a Legendre series
<P><A NAME=psisubl>&#160;</A><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig156.gif"><P>
<P>
The Boltzmann equation becomes 
<P><A NAME=massive2>&#160;</A><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig157.gif"><P>
<P>
Because these equations are independent of the direction of <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig158.gif">,
the integration needs to be performed for each <EM>l</EM> on a grid in

<EM>k</EM>.
and

<EM>q</EM>.
High-resolution runs use 10,000 values of

<EM>l</EM>, 5000 values of

<EM>k</EM>,
and 128 values of 

<EM>q</EM>,
or <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig159.gif"> points.  For photons and
massless neutrinos the

<EM>q</EM>-dependence
is trivial (<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig160.gif"> in eqs. 8),
allowing us to integrate over

<EM>q</EM>
analytically and thereby simplify
the numerical integration.
<P>
<H3><A NAME=SECTION00060000000000000000>6. Gravitational Source Terms</A></H3>
<P>
The last piece needed for inclusion of the massive neutrinos is the
means by which we go from the phase space distribution to the density,
velocity, and shear stress fluctuations appearing in equations (2).
As <A HREF="sc95bib.html">Ma and Bertschinger (1995)</A>
show, these are given by simple integrals
over momentum:
<P><A NAME=delta2>&#160;</A><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./IMAGES/fig161.gif"><P>
These integrals are performed using 6th and 8th-order Newton-Cotes
quadratures.
