<H2>Re-Launching the ISDF Newsletter:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Call for Contributions</H2>

<P>The ISDF Newsletter started as a simple, printed A5 booklet.  It was only
intended to provide some general news on C & C++ standardisation to a group of
members within ACCU who were interested in the standards and who contributed
some donations to help the UK standard representatives' costs.  If you aren't
familiar with the ACCU (The Association of C and C++ Users - Francis
Glassborow is the chair), then you can look at <A HREF="http://www.accu.org">www.accu.org</A> for further
information.  Past copies of the Newsletter are also on the Web as shown
above, however don't be too concerned with what the newsletter has been in
the <strong>past</strong>, I want to discuss what it may be in the <strong>future</strong>.</P>

<H2>Who Will It Be For?</H2>

<P>There are two, overlapping groups of people who may be interested in the
newsletter.  The first group includes people, such as yourself, who are
actively involved in the standards process.  The second group includes those
who have a keen interest in the standards but cannot directly participate.
The problem for the second group is that it is very difficult to keep up with
just what is happening.  Actually, it can sometimes be difficult for the
first group to keep up, but that is another matter. :-)</P> <P>The ISDF
Newsletter aims to provide useful and timely information to both of these
groups.</P>

<H2>What Will It Contain?</H2>
<P>I don't want to put too many constraints on the contents of future ISDF
Newsletters.  They only limit that I intend to impose is that the subject
must be related to standards for C, C++ or Java (CCJ, hereafter).  Within
that, I would welcome a wide range of subjects.  Other standards could be
included provided they have direct relevance to CCJ (For example - Posix
bindings or Locales) and the article addresses that connection.</P>

<P>There are a wide range of possibilities for the types of article that would be
suitable.  The key is that they should be about an aspect of standardisation
rather than simply about a technical aspect of the language. The exception
could be articles explaining features which are newly added to the language.</P>

<P>For example, an article simply explaining how to use 'X' feature would probably
not be suitable, but an article explaining _WHY_ 'X' has been standardised in
this particular way certainly would be suitable.  Remember, most readers won't
have seen or heard the discussions that have taken place in committee and will
be curious why things were designed in a particular way.  As far as I am
aware, there is no Rationale being written for the C++ standard, so there is
scope for a lot of articles explaining why many decisions went they way they
did, despite not being the 'obvious' solution.</P>

<P>Many of the standards-oriented articles that appeared in the now sadly
defunct 'Journal of C Language Translation' would be suitable.</P>
<P>
Other examples of possible subject matter are
</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Proposals currently being studied.
  <LI>Why was a feature added?  What benefit did it bring, what problem was it
  trying to solve?
  <LI>Why was a proposal rejected?  Was it 'worthy', but rejected for
  non-obvious reasons?
  <LI>Examinations of defects in the standards!!
  <LI>The standards process itself.  How does it work, should there be changes?
  <LI>The current state of proposals.
  <LI>Compatibility issues / silent changes  (e.g. long long/size_t in C9X)
  <LI>Explain 'Standardese'.  The language in which standards in written has some
  subtle traps for those who don't have first hand experience in the process.
  <LI>Interpretations of sections of the standard.  Many things are not as
  straightforward as they seem to 'outsiders'.
  <LI>Articles about related standards and how they affect CCJ programmers.
  (e.g. Embedded C++ initiative)
  <LI>Lists of available standards resources.
  <LI>Diaries of Meetings, Conferences, etc
</UL>
<P>Please note that this is <strong>not</strong> an exhaustive list; merely a few suggestions to
get you thinking. Hopefully you can think of many others that are not on the
list. I am hoping for a range of articles suitable for both target groups.
Remember too, that some people may belong to both groups.  A participant in
one standard, but an outsider in another.</P>

<H2>Why Is It Needed?</H2>

<P>There are already quite a few places where CCJ standards are discussed, so why
should we need another?  Well it's possible that we don't need another.  If I
get no contributions, I'll have to assume that is the case. :-)
</P>
<P>If we look at some of the current outlets for discussion of standards, we see
a number of problems.  Commercial journals have limited space for standards
material (and it seems to be shrinking).  They also only accept a certain type
of article.  (And, of course, you only see it if you buy it!) There is
comp.std.*, but these are very dynamic and ephemeral. Many sites only hold
news for a few days and items can easily be missed.  Nor are the comp.std.*
groups ideal for certain classes of article. Finally there are the reflectors
for WG21, WG14, etc, but these are by definition of restricted availability.  </P>
<P>Obviously there is a certain degree of overlap between what currently is
published in journals, comp.std.* and the reflectors and what I hope will be
published in the ISDF Newsletter.  I believe there are many
potential contributions, however, which do not currently have a suitable
outlet.  I hope to make the ISDF Newsletter such an outlet.</P>

<H2>How Much Will It Cost?</H2>

Nothing, it will be free.  Extra copies can be order at half price. :-)

<H2>How Will It Be Distributed?</H2>

<P>I intend to publish the ISDF Newsletter primarily as a Web Journal.  This
avoids just about all the costs involved in publishing, such as printing and
postage.  What small costs may be incurred will be met by the ACCU.  It also
allows a much faster turn-around between Copy Due and Publishing dates.</P>

<P>My intention is to place the Newsletter on the ACCU Web site, then notify
'subscribers' by email to say it is available.  For those who may not have Web
access, it will also be available as a ZIPed (and/or Tarred, etc) file by ftp.</P>

<P>As some people may like to produce hard copy, I am considering making an RTF
version available too.  (This could allow local redistribution within
companies, for example.)</P>

<H2>What About Copyright?</H2>

Copyright of the entire journal (i.e. the collection of articles) will be
with the ACCU.  Copyright of individual contributions would remain with the
author, and could be freely published elsewhere at the author's discretion.

<H2>Why Should I Contribute?</H2>
<P>Because you have something to say, is the simple answer.  Also, because I
believe it would do the entire CCJ community a service if more standards
information were made generally available.  There are many, many members of
the CCJ programming community who would like to be better informed about what
is happening with standards; it would be a nice, altruistic act to write for
them.</P>

<P>It might also be good public relations for the committee members.  Some
committee decisions are criticised because outsiders do not see the complex,
subtle issues that drove the decision.  Making such matters more public might
help to disarm some of the misinformed criticism.  </P>

<P>(Unfortunately, it won't disarm any of the informed criticism. :-)</P>

<P>When thinking about possible articles, please remember that the Newsletter
will be trying to service both readership groups, the experts who want to
exchange technical material among themselves and the 'outsiders' who want to
understand more of what is happening on the 'inside'.  </P>

<H2>How Do I Contribute?</H2>

<P>Articles should be e-mailed to isdf__at__accu.org or posted on PC readable floppy to</P>

<P>If e-mailing, it would help if you could put ARTICLE or CONTRIBUTION in the
subject. </P>

<P>Preferred format is plain text, Word (2,6,97) or Rich Text (.rtf).  I will
consider taking submission in HTML once I have tested how well Word imports
them.</P>

<P>I regret that I cannot handle troff, latex, postscript etc.  The master
document will be constructed in Word for Windows and I can't afford the time
to do lots of conversions manually.  </P>

<H2>When Should I Contribute?</H2>

<P>I am currently aiming at quarterly publication. The saving grace with an
electronic publication is that I can still put it out with relatively few items
if I have to.  I hope there will be sufficient interest and support to justify
continuing with quarterly publication in the longer term.</P>

<P>I'm happy to take contributions *anytime*, but my planned publication diary is:</P>


  <TABLE CELLPADDING=5>
<TR>
  <TD><strong>Copy Due</strong></TD>
  <TD><strong>Published</strong></TD>

    <TR>
      <TD>22 August 97</TD>

      <TD>8 June 98</TD>
    </TR>
</TABLE>
<P>I realise 22 August isn't far away, but I assume if I gave you twelve months
notice, most people would write their article in the last two weeks anyway. :-)
Also, I am hoping that many of you will already have a treasure trove of
material already to use as a starting point.  Maybe something you wrote on the
reflector or comp.std.* could be a suitable basis for an article.</P>


<P>If you wish to discuss possible contributions with me, please feel free
to do so.  Otherwise just write the article up and send it off.  All mail
should be sent to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/spamblock.pl?ref=aXNkZkBhY2N1Lm9yZw%3d%3d">isdf__at__accu.org</A>. </P>
