    <td><p align="left"><font size="4"><small>Hull City supremo and British Tennis legend
    David Lloyd is set to quit Hull City after admitting he's getting out of Boothferry park
    as soon as possible.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="4"><small>In the same interview he insulted his supporters and
    the people of Hull when he said:</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="4"><small>&quot;I'm going - I am not staying! I am the only
    person in the history of Hull who's put his hand in his pocket, paid the bills and tried
    to do everything that I set out to do.&quot;</small></font></p>
    <p align="left">He continued: &quot;At every turn I've been thwarted by every person in
    Hull. There'll be no football in Hull and it wont be my fault.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left">Lloyd announced to the joy of their supporters that he was putting the
    club up for sale immediately at an asking price of £1.8m. Fans group supremo Angie Bowe
    said:</p>
    <p align="left">&quot;We now know where we stand - finally the guy has put a price on what
    he wants for the club and we all hope now that someone will come in and buy it. Lets hope
    thats the case and we desperately need someone who is interested in football and not
    making a fast buck out of selling Boothferry Park off to the developers.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left">The planned pre-match pitch invasion before last Saturdays match was
    called off.</p>
    <p align="left">Supporters plan to group together to purchase a share in the club in a
    similar scheme to that successfully employed at Bournemouth and Barcelona. More on this
    concept later in the week.</p>
