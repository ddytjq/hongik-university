AB: Renal-coloboma syndrome is a recently described autosomal dominant syndrome
of abnormal optic nerve and renal development. Two families have been reported
with renal-coloboma syndrome and mutations of the PAX2 gene. The PAX2 gene,
which encodes a DNA-binding protein, is expressed in the developing ear, CNS,
eye, and urogenital tract. Ocular and/or renal abnormalities have been
consistently noted in the five reports of patients with renal-coloboma
syndrome, to date, but PAX2 expression patterns suggest that auditory and CNS
abnormalities may be additional features of renal-coloboma syndrome. To
determine whether additional clinical features are associated with PAX2
mutations, we have used PCR-SSCP to identify PAX2 gene mutations in patients.
We report here four patients with mutations in exon 2, one of whom has severe
ocular and renal disease, microcephaly, and retardation, and another who has
ocular and renal disease with high-frequency hearing loss. Unexpectedly,
extreme variability in clinical presentation was observed between a mother, her
son, and an unrelated patient, all of whom had the same PAX2 mutation as
previously described in two siblings with renal-coloboma syndrome. These
results suggest that a sequence of seven Gs in PAX2 exon 2 may be particularly
prone to mutation.<p>

AB: We describe a 5 year old boy with a de novo t(10;13) translocation and
optic nerve coloboma-renal disease (ONCR). On the basis of GTG banding analysis
of prometaphase chromosomes, the patient's karyotype was interpreted as either
46,XY,t(10;13)(q24.3;q12.3) or t(10;13) (q25.2;q14.1). Fluorescence in situ
hybridisation (FISH) studies using a YAC clone containing the PAX2 gene and YAC
clones adjoining FRA10B at 10q25.2 showed that the 10q breakpoint had occurred
just within the PAX2 gene and was proximal to FRA10B. These FISH results
suggest that the translocation causes a disruption of the PAX2 gene and leads
to ONCR, in agreement with the recent reports of PAX2 mutations in two
unrelated families with ONCR. Furthermore, we refined the regional mapping of
the human PAX2 gene to the junction of bands 10q24.3 and 10q25.1.<p>

AB: A wide range of fundic variants are encountered during routine
ophthalmoscopic examination of visually normal horses, often causing the
examiner difficulty in assessing their clinical significance. Many of these are
anatomical variants having no significant effect on visual function, and lie
within the limits of normality in the horse. This paper illustrates this range
of variants and discusses their anatomical basis and physiological
consequences. Colobomata are non-progressive discontinuities in the structure
of the anatomic fundus, occasionally noted as incidental findings during
ophthalmoscopy. This paper illustrates typical and atypical colobomata of the
equine fundus, the latter occurring outside the embryonic optic fissure. The
anatomical basis of these colobomata and their possible consequence on vision
is discussed.<p>

AB: PURPOSE: To categorize and describe the type of optic disc involvement and
blood vessel patterns seen in patients with fundus coloboma. METHODS: This is a
prospective study involving 67 eyes of 40 patients with choroidal coloboma. The
evaluation included documentation of fundus details using fundus drawings or
photographs, or both. RESULTS: Six types of disc involvement were identified:
(1) normal disc outside fundus coloboma (27.8%); (2) disc outside the fundus
coloboma and abnormal (10.4%); (3) disc outside the fundus coloboma and
independently colobomatous (8.9%); (4) disc within the fundus coloboma and
normal (5.0%); (5) disc within the fundus coloboma and colobomatous (44.3%);
and (6) disc shape not identified but blood vessels seen emanating from the
superior border of the large fundus coloboma (2.9%). Visual acuity was better
in types I, II, and III compared with IV, V, and VI. Microphthalmos was more
common with the more severe anomalies. High myopia was more common in the less
severe anomalies. CONCLUSION: Optic disc involvement in fundus coloboma is
widely variable. Of fundus colobomas, 67.2% are associated with either a
frankly colobomatous or an altered disc. Of the discs located outside fundus
colobomas, 41% are also abnormal. Visual acuity was better in types I, II, and
III.<p>

AB: Ophthalmic pathological findings of hydrolethalus, a midline malformation
syndrome, were determined in three fetuses aborted between the 14th and 19th
gestational week. The eyes were serially sectioned and analyzed using light
microscopy and a panel of 13 antibodies to neuronal, glial, epithelial, and
mesenchymal elements of the eye. The general morphological and antigenic
development of the anterior segment, retina and choroid were normal, but some
lens fibers were vacuolated and irregular in all eyes. A coloboma of the optic
nerve was constant and corresponded in its severity to the systemic
manifestations. It ranged from segmental dysplasia of the optic nerve head to a
colobomatous orbital cyst with secondary microphthalmos and deranged
development of the eye. Glial tissue extended through a defect in the sheaths
of the optic nerve in three eyes, communicating with retinoblastic tissue in
the orbit. Evidence of secondary optic nerve hypoplasia was present in all
eyes, and a separate chorioretinal coloboma was present in one eye. Ocular
anomalies should be considered one hallmark of hydrolethalus syndrome, and they
may help to differentiate it from other overlapping malformation syndromes. In
particular, colobomatous dysplasia and hypoplasia of the optic nerve seem to be
typical of hydrolethalus syndrome. Histopathological studies of the eyes may
help the neuropathologist in making the differential diagnosis of midline
malformation syndromes.<p>

AB: PURPOSE: Optic nerve pit is a rare congenital anomaly. In two third of the
patients, the severity of the disease is increased by the apparition of a
serous macular detachment, which may compromise the visual prognosis. The aim
of this study is to propose a therapy appropriate to such complication.
METHODS: A prospective study was performed including 10 patients with a serous
macular detachment caused by optic nerve pit. All patients underwent
intraocular surgery including vitrectomy, peripapillary photocoagulation and
intravitreal injection of gas. The mean postoperative follow-up period was 9.5
months. RESULTS: Therapy success was based on anatomical and functional
results. Serous macular detachment reattached in 7 patients out of 10 and a
recurrence was observed in one case. Visual acuity improved from 0 to 18 lines
of the EDTRS chart (mean increase: 6.7 lines). CONCLUSION: These results
confirm that intraocular surgery including vitrectomy-photocoagulation-gas
injection is a valuable treatment for serous macular detachment associated with
optic nerve pit.<p>

AB: We report a rare case of morning glory syndrome with choroidal neovascular
membrane and contractile movement of the optic disc. A 12-year-old healthy boy
was first seen in April 1992 with a chief complaint of transient visual loss in
his left eye for 3 months. The diagnosis of morning glory syndrome was made by
the characteristic optic nerve head. His visual acuity was 1.2 in both eyes. In
August 1994, retinal hemorrhage associated with choroidal neovascular membrane
was observed in the macula of his left eye, resulting in a decrease of visual
acuity to 0.4. In October 1994, we observed contractile movement in the morning
glory optic disc. Using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO), we could observe
the disc contracting for approximately 2 seconds and then dilating again over a
20-second period. The contractile movement was not evoked by exposure to a
strong light or by the Valsalva maneuver. However, it seemed to be induced by
digital massage of the eyeball.<p>

AB: A 2-month-old female presented with nonrhegmatogenous retinal detachment in
Dandy-Walker syndrome. At the fist examination, coloboma involving the optic
disc in both eyes was detected. The left eye showed microphthalmos with
sclerocornea, persistent pupillary membrane, hypoplasia of the iris stroma, and
bullous retinal detachment near the optic disc. Chromosomal analysis revealed a
mosaic pattern: 46, XX/47, XXX. Increased intracranial pressure associated with
Dandy-Walker syndrome was detected by a neurosurgeon at the age of 3 months.
The patient was followed for several weeks, and then nonrhegmatogenous retinal
detachment appeared in the right eye. Subretinal fluid alternately increased
and decreased in both eyes. A ventriculo-peritoneal shunt was performed at the
age of 6 months, and the retinal detachment was remarkably reduced in both eyes
after lowering of intracranial pressure. Coloboma involving the optic disc,
sclerocornea, persistent pupillary membrane, hypoplasia of iris stroma, and
Dandy-Walker syndrome were thought to be caused by the abnormal development of
neural crest cells. We surmised that the retinal detachment in this case might
have resulted from a communicating pathway between the subarachnoid space and
the subretinal space. We concluded that the etiology of retinal detachment
associated with optic disc anomaly should be investigated to determine adequate
treatment.<p>

AB: BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the relationship to visual acuity of four
ophthalmoscopic features of colobomas involving the optic nerve. The goal was
to identify those features that could predict potential visual acuity of
children with these colobomas. METHODS: Fundus photographs of 23 eyes with
colobomas involving the optic nerve met the entry criteria and were evaluated
by two masked observers. The following features were evaluated: coloboma size,
optic nerve color, foveal development, and subfoveal retinal pigment epithelial
changes. Simple linear regression was used to identify the feature that most
closely correlated with visual acuity. Refractive status was assessed by
cycloplegic refraction. RESULTS: The only component that correlated with the
development of good visual acuity was the degree of foveal involvement by the
optic nerve coloboma (P = .002, R = 0.8). Significant refractive error and
anisometropia were common in patients with colobomas involving the optic nerve.
CONCLUSION: Central visual acuity in children born with colobomas involving the
optic nerve correlates with the development of normal foveal anatomy,
regardless of the size of the coloboma, the color of the optic nerve, or the
presence of subfoveal pigmentary changes. Because refractive error is common,
these children should receive an accurate refraction and amblyopia treatment.<p>

AB: PAX2 is one of nine PAX genes that have been described in vertebrates. Each
PAX gene contains a conserved paired box domain that was first identified in
Drosophila. PAX2 encodes a transcription factor that has a critical role in the
development of the urogenital tract, the eyes, and the CNS. Recently, we
reported a mutation of PAX2 in patients with optic nerve coloboma,
vesicoureteric reflux, and renal anomalies. To facilitate further analysis of
PAX2 mutations in human disease, we have now determined the complete structure
of the human PAX2 gene. Five genomic lambda clones containing human PAX2 gene
sequences were isolated. Sequencing and restriction mapping of these clones
showed that human PAX2 was composed of 12 exons spanning approximately 70 kb.
Two alternatively spliced exons and a dinuclotide repeat polymorphism were also
determined in PAX2. These data will be useful in characterizing the role of
PAX2 in human disease.<p>

eyes with optic nerve aplasia. METHODS: Three eyes in two patients with
clinical optic nerve aplasia were studied. RESULTS: Examination disclosed
posterior segment neovascularization in one eye and progressive posterior
segment neovascularization in two eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Posterior segment
neovascularization may occur in association with optic nerve aplasia. Retinal
ischemia or retinochoroidal anatomic disorganization, or both, may provide the
stimulus for neovascularization in such eyes.<p>

AB: PURPOSE: This paper describes the surgical rehabilitation of a child with
craniofacial anomalies, unilateral syndactyly, and partial unilateral
cryptophthalmos associated with inferior colobomata of the iris and optic nerve
and agenesis of the inferior rectus and inferior oblique muscles. The clinical
presentation of cryptophthalmos is described. METHODS: The medical literature
since the original description of cryptophthalmos in 1872 was reviewed to
define patterns of inheritance and the incidence of associated anomalies.
RESULTS: Including this patient, 149 case reports of cryptophthalmos were
identified. In two families transmission from parent to child suggests dominant
inheritance. None of the five dominant cases had any other anomalies, and all
had bilateral complete cryptophthalmos. The incidence of cryptophthalmos in the
remaining families is consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. This
group includes patients with bilateral, unilateral, and partial
cryptophthalmos. Other anomalies are common, including those of the ear and
nose, limbs, genitourinary system, and mouth and palate. Mortality in the
perinatal period is associated with renal agenesis, laryngeal atresia, and
pulmonary hypoplasia. CONCLUSIONS: Cryptophthalmos is a rare congenital anomaly
with two patterns of inheritance.<p>

AB: We describe a father and 3 sons with optic nerve colobomas, vesicoureteral
reflux, and renal anomalies. The youngest son had congenital renal failure and
ultimately underwent renal transplantation. The father and one son had high
frequency hearing loss. There were no other affected relatives. We conclude
that the association of optic nerve colobomas, renal anomalies, and
vesicoureteral reflux comprises a unique autosomal dominant syndrome. Molecular
investigations have determined this disorder to be associated with a single
nucleotide deletion in the PAX2 gene.<p>

AB: The association of Morning Glory anomaly with intracranial pathology has
been rarely described and seems to be a distinct one. A 41-week full-term
infant presenting with Morning Glory anomaly and multiple major and minor
anomalies with a normal karyotype is described. Right Parieto-occipital
porencephaly with mild hydrocephaly of lateral ventricle, right brain atrophy
and enlarged thalami were observed by repeated ultrasound, computed tomography
and magnetic resonance imaging examinations. Fundoscopy, visual evoked response
and electroretinography revealed bilateral colobomas of the optic nerve,
bilateral Morning Glory optic disc anomaly, severe exotropia and medial recti
paralysis. Non-obstructive, non-refluxing left hydronephrosis and left
hydroureter were diagnosed by renal investigations. To the best of our
knowledge the association of the described malformations has never been
previously reported. The clinical and nosological significance of this new
entity is discussed.<p>

associated malformations of the retinal vessels. METHODS: Slit-lamp
biomicroscopy and fluorescein angiography were performed. RESULTS: Multiple
retinal venous anastomoses associated with a congenital coloboma and pit of the
optic disk were observed. The retinal vascular anomalies extended from the
optic disk to the temporal periphery. CONCLUSIONS: We consider the coexistence
of retinal venous anastomoses with optic disk coloboma and pit to be an
extremely rare congenital retinal anomaly.<p>

retinal detachment associated with a morning glory disc of his left eye.
Perfluorodecalin was injected to unfold the retina. During surgery,
perfluorodecalin leaked repeatedly under the retina. This case demonstrates
that a retinal hole in tissues lying within the optic disc anomaly provides a
communication for fluid and perfluorodecalin between the subretinal space and
vitreous cavity resulting in a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in the morning
glory syndrome.<p>

malignant melanoma of the choroid. Some aspects of the pathogeny of the retinal
decoloration are discussed in this context. Some possible corrections between
the two border retinal decolorations--the serous interpapillary macular
decoloration and the retinal decoloration secondary to the melanoma of the
choroid--are also proposed.<p>

AB: Paired box (PAX) genes play a critical role in human development and
disease. The PAX2 gene is expressed in primitive cells of the kidney, ureter,
eye, ear and central nervous system. We have conducted a mutational analysis of
PAX2 in a family with optic nerve colobomas, renal hypoplasia, mild proteinuria
and vesicoureteral reflux. We report a single nucleotide deletion in exon five,
causing a frame-shift of the PAX2 coding region in the octapeptide domain. The
phenotype resulting from the PAX2 mutation in this family was very similar to
abnormalities that have been reported in Krd mutant mice. These data suggest
that PAX2 is required for normal kidney and eye development.<p>

AB: We describe congenital colobomatous malformations of the optic nerve and
the clinical variations and complications that may appear eventually in them.
We also present two clinical cases of patients with papillary colobomatous
defects where spontaneous variations have been observed throughout their
evolution and where the current ophthalmoscopic aspect is completely different
from the initial one. Finally, bearing in mind the embryologic origin and
histologic structure of these anomalies, we develop a hypothesis that explains
the physiopathologic mechanism that causes the clinical changes described in
each case.<p>

infrapapillary retinochoroidal depigmentation in association with dysplastic
optic discs. METHODS: Clinical data from all patients with V- or tongue-shaped
infrapapillary retinochoroidal depigmentation and dysplastic optic discs were
evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: Five patients with this atypical
colobomatous anomaly had transsphenoidal encephalocele. A sixth patient had an
ectopic midline pharyngeal mass with no skull-base defect. CONCLUSION: In
patients with optic disc dysplasias, the finding of this V- or tongue-shaped
retinochoroidal pigmentary anomaly should prompt neuroimaging to look for
transsphenoidal encephalocele.<p>

AB: PURPOSE/METHODS: In a patient with a coloboma of the optic nerve, inferior
retina and choroid, and deep portions of the sclera, a retrobulbar vessel moved
irregularly relative to the retinal vessels, which moved contiguously with the
posterior globe. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Fluorescein angiography showed the
retrobulbar vessel filling slightly later than overlying retinal vessels. We
conclude that the retrobulbar vessel was a vein situated inferiorly to the
optic nerve.<p>

AB: A 12-year-old patient presenting with absence of the optic disc and retinal
blood vessels associated with atrophic macular lesion was studied. A toxoplasma
IgG antibody test had been found positive at the age of 4 months. This test and
the clinical findings suggested the possibility of optic nerve aplasia with
atypical macular coloboma due to congenital toxoplasmosis. The pro's and
contra's concerning this hypothesis are discussed by the authors.<p>

AB: PURPOSE: The pathogenesis of the sensory retinal detachment of the macula
associated with congenital pit of the optic nerve remains controversal. Based
on our cases and the cases reported in literature, we propose a management plan
for macular retinal detachment associated with optic nerve pit. METHODS: In
this retrospective study ten eyes were treated for progressive visual loss.
Treatment modalities were different depending on the time period: laser
photocoagulation (to the juxtapapillary region) alone, laser combined with
intraocular gas injection (C3 F8), laser combined with vitrectomy and
intraocular gas tamponnade (S F6, C3 F8), laser combined with vitrectomy and
temporary silicone oil tamponade. RESULTS: The follow-up period ranged between
one and five years (mean follow-up thirty three months). We had eight successes
and two definitive failures (an old macular detachment treated only by one
laser session, and a young girl who had not kept the prone position after gas
injection). In the group of six eyes treated by laser alone, only two retinal
treatments were directly successfully treated; in three other eyes, the
detachment recurred and was treated with success in a second step by a gas
injection; the sixth eye is the first definitive failure (old detachment). In
the five eyes treated by laser combined gas injection with or without pars
plana vitrectomy (including three failures of laser alone), the retina remained
attached in four eyes during the follow-up period; the sixth eye was the second
definitive failure (the young girl). In the both eyes treated by vitrectomy and
silicon oil injection, the retina has flattened. CONCLUSION: The results
suggest that laser photocoagulation alone is not so efficient and that
vitrectomy is not necessary with gas injection. Complete resorption of
subretinal fluid occurred in eight eyes: two with laser photocoagulation alone,
and six with a long term tamponnade combined with a peripapillary laser
photocoagulation. In first treatment, this technique (laser with tamponade) is
a valuable approach to manage serous macular detachment associated with optic
nerve pit.<p>

syndrome. CT examination of the orbits was performed in three patients. Images
of 2-mm-thick sections were acquired at 2-mm intervals without use of contrast
material. Excellent demonstration of coloboma was achieved in each case.
Because both magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography have limitations in
imaging of coloboma, CT is the imaging method of choice in diagnosis of this
disorder.<p>

AB: We managed 19 eyes of 19 patients with serous macular detachment associated
with optic nerve pits with photocoagulation of the temporal edge of the optic
disc combined with intravitreal injection of an expanding gas. SF6 was used in
8 eyes, and C3F8 in 11 eyes at the initial treatment. Eight eyes (42%) had
repeated treatment because of failed initial treatment and/or late
recurrence(s). Eighteen patients were followed up for 4 to 110 months (mean
follow-up: 39 months). At the last examination the macula was attached in 17 of
18 eyes (94.4%). However 3 patients (17.6%) showed a limited serous retinal
detachment distant from the macula. The results achieved after single treatment
were better with C3F8 than with SF6 (78.5% versus 57% anatomical success rate).
During the follow-up period, 5 eyes (27.7%) developed one or two late
recurrences. Macular reattachment occurred spontaneously in 2 eyes and after
repeated C3F8 injection in 3 eyes. The final visual acuity was improved by 0.1
to 0.6 as compared to the initial visual acuity in 12 patients (66.6%). Ten
patients (55.5%) had a final visual acuity &gt; or = 0.5 and &gt; or = Parinaud
scale no. 2. We believe that photocoagulation treatment combined with C3F8
intravitreal injection is a valuable approach to the management of serous
macular detachment associated with optic nerve pits. However the treatment also
shows limitations, in particular the need for repeated treatment in failed eyes
and/or eyes with late recurrences.<p>

AB: In a study of 12 patients with optic nerve pits, a female patient presented
an unusual fundus finding in which there were many flat grey-white lesions in
both eyes. These lesions covered a large area of the fundus and extended from
the posterior pole to the periphery. There was an optic pit in the right eye
and an inferior coloboma in the left eye. The visual acuities and the clinical
findings remained unchanged over the follow-up period of 2 years. Fluorescein
angiographic and electrophysiological examinations suggested that these lesions
were probably located at or beneath the retinal pigment epithelium.<p>

AB: A 15-year-old myopic girl had a retinal detachment associated with optic
disc coloboma and a macular hole. The retinal detachment was treated
successfully with vitrectomy, drainage of the subretinal fluid, and gas
tamponade. The possibility of a macular hole should be investigated in myopic
eyes with optic disc colobomas and retinal detachments. To the best of our
knowledge, such a combination has not been described previously.<p>

AB: Coloboma of the lens is characterized by notching of the equator of the
lens. The cause of the condition is faulty development of the zonule. The lens
deprived of its normal pull in the defective region is thicker and more
spherical as if there were no loss of its substance. We report five cases of
lens coloboma and localized zonular defect without any associated systemic
anomalies. One case included retinal detachment; another included an iris
coloboma; and a third included iris, choroid and optic disk colobomas and
retinal detachment with lens coloboma. The remaining two cases were without
associated ocular anomalies. The pathogenic mechanisms and relationship of this
defect with the differentiation of the tertiary vitreous and development of the
zonule is discussed. The defect most likely occurs in the third to fourth
months of gestation during differentiation of the tertiary vitreous in response
to toxic, inflammatory or genetic factors.<p>

AB: Ocular defects are often found in association with many systemic disorders.
Some are already present at birth, but in other cases they develop in early
infancy or later in life. They are found associated with connective tissue
disorders, neurological conditions, chromosomal abnormalities and
dermatological disorders. Some of these syndromes have a genetic basis but
often it is uncertain whether they are inherited and their cause is unknown.<p>

AB: We report the case of a 14-year-old girl with multiple findings
characteristic of Noonan's syndrome, including short stature, mild mental
retardation, facial, skeletal and renal abnormalities. In addition, ophthalmic
examination revealed a keratoconus in the left eye and a right optic disc
coloboma. To date, only two cases of Noonan's syndrome with keratoconus have
been reported, and this is the second case of this syndrome with optic disc
coloboma. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Noonan's syndrome
associated with unilateral keratoconus and contralateral optic disc coloboma.
In view of the large number of patients with Noonan's syndrome reported to date
and the rarity of these ocular abnormalities, it is most likely that this
association is fortuitous. Ocular findings reported in patients with Noonan's
syndrome are reviewed.<p>

AB: A case of unilateral microphthalmos with a sizeable retrobulbar cyst,
totally dysplastic retina, and gross nerve head coloboma is reported in an
otherwise normal pigmented rabbit. Despite the gross abnormality of the
posterior part of the globe, an iris sectoral coloboma, and abnormal lentoid
body, the cornea was complete but had moderate edema and a reduced diameter.
Scanning electron microscopy and morphometric analysis of the corneal
endothelium showed a fully tessellated mosaic of cells that displayed only
modest pleomorphism and polymegethism.<p>

AB: Posterior keratoconus is an unusual abnormality of the cornea generally
classified as one of the anterior chamber cleavage anomalies. It is
characterized clinically by the presence of a circumscribed or generalized
corneal thinning with posterior depression of the cornea and is considered
distinct from keratoconus. Although patients with posterior keratoconus may
have visual complaints clearly related to their abnormal corneas, the surface
topography of these corneas has not been studied in detail. Keratometry and
photokeratoscopy provide an incomplete picture of the surface geometry of
posterior keratoconus. We utilized computer assisted topographic analysis to

Modeling System demonstrated that the patient's cornea showed a central

AB: Seven eyes from seven patients with retinal detachment and choroidal
coloboma (with or without optic disc involvement) were treated. The retinal
break was always inside the colobomatous area, except in the cases with
evidence of peripheral retinal breaks. In order to produce reattachment of the
retina, vitrectomy procedures with removal of posterior hyaloid were used.
Drainage of subretinal fluid was performed through the break in the area of the
coloboma, with simultaneous fluid-air exchange. Previously undetected retinal
breaks were identified by inspecting for the presence of schlieren in the
colobomatous area during fluid-air exchange. A peripheral scleral buckle was
then applied. Argon laser endophotocoagulation was performed, but when the
coloboma involved the optic disc, red krypton endophotocoagulation was used.
Retinal reattachment was achieved in all cases.<p>

AB: Cilioretinal arteries were noted to accompany pits of the optic disc in 16
of 25 cases (64%). Fourteen of the 16 cases were found to have 2 cilioretinal
arteries (86%). The cilioretinal arteries were directly related to the pit of
the disc and emerged either from the bottom or the margin of the pit in a
proportion of 86%. This finding reinforces the assumption that the optic disc
pit belongs to the same spectrum of congenital anomalies which also includes
optic disc coloboma, megalopapilla and morning glory syndrome. A fluorescein
angiography study showed hyperfluorescence of the pit in 12/16 cases and in
particular in all the cases in which both cilioretinal arteries emerged from
the pit. Hypofluorescence was noted in 7/9 cases in which the pit was not
associated with cilioretinal arteries. Our findings could support the view that
hyperfluorescence of the pit, which is not a constant phenomenon, mostly
depends on the presence of cilioretinal arteries emerging from the pit.<p>

AB: The authors studied 35 patients with Leber's congenital amaurosis and
assessed visual acuity, fundus appearance, and systemic findings. The patients
were arbitrarily divided into five age groups. Visual acuities were comparable
at all ages. Of 22 patients seen for follow-up examinations (mean length of
follow-up, 5 years), vision worsened slightly in only 4 patients (3 with
macular coloboma-like lesions and 1 with keratoconus). Fifty percent of retinal
examinations in patients younger than 1 year of age were normal. With
increasing age, retinal pigmentary changes became evident. All but four
patients seen on more than one occasion developed progressive retinal/retinal
pigment epithelium changes. Cataracts (5 patients) and keratoconus (3 patients)
were present only in older patients (9 to 33 years of age). In Leber's
congenital amaurosis, which probably comprises a number of genetically
heterogenous conditions, visual acuity remains stable despite progressive
retinal pigmentary changes. The subgroup of patients with macular colobomas,
however, may develop progressive decrease in vision. Cataracts and keratoconus
are additional factors contributing to visual impairment in older patients.<p>

AB: Aicardi syndrome is characterized by infantile spasms, agenesis of the
corpus callosum, severe mental retardation, and a characteristic
chorioretinopathy with lacunar defects. The authors report on a 2-year-old girl
with congenital hydrocephaly who was found unresponsive by the baby-sitter and
died shortly thereafter. At autopsy, the histopathologic findings, which were
confined to the brain and eyes, were found highly characteristic of AIC. The
main abnormalities included agenesis of the corpus callosum, micropolygyria,
bilateral papillomas of choroid plexi, bilateral microphthalmia, bilateral
hypoplasia of the optic nerves, bilateral colobomas of the juxtapapillaris
choroid and optic disc, bilateral total retinal detachment with dysplastic
rosettes and chorioretinal lacunae with focal thinning, and atrophy of the
retinal pigment epithelium and choroid. A detailed histopathologic study of the
ocular findings and the brain anomalies is presented. The results of scanning
electron microscopy of the chorioretinal lacunae demonstrated peculiar
papillary proliferations of the retinal pigment epithelium in both eyes.<p>

41 weeks were examined pathologically. Atrophy of the ganglion cell and nerve
fibre layers of the retina was found in all cases; optic nerve atrophy was
noted in all 10 specimens in which the optic nerve was identified. In addition
to findings attributable to immaturity, including persistent pupillary membrane
(in 10 globes) and incomplete formation of the anterior chamber angle (in 5),
we noted retinal dysplasia (in 4), colobomata (in 2) and proliferative
retinopathy (in 1). Uncommon or previously undescribed abnormalities in
association with anencephaly included cystic malformations of the meninges,
sclera and globe (in one case each).<p>

AB: Among 11 patients who presented as blind in early infancy, with Leber's
congenital amaurosis (5 patients), optic nerve hypoplasia (4 patients), or
macular colobomata (2 patients), 8 developed visually guided behavior and
measurable grating acuity by age 5 to 46 months. All children with measurable
grating acuity demonstrated visually guided mobility. Grating acuity was
predictive of later visual performance in 10 of 11 patients by age 12 to 16
months. The best grating acuity attained by 7 months was 1.3 to 3.0
cycles/degrees (20/460 to 20/200) and 0.13 cycles/degrees (20/4700) by month 8.
Two patients with Leber's congenital amaurosis and one with optic nerve
hypoplasia remained blind. No clinical features existed to differentiate these
three patients from the eight whose visual status improved. Posterior visual
pathway maturation may underlie the improvement.<p>

13, confirmed by karyotype analysis. Pathologic examination of the eyes
revealed typical features of trisomy 13, including microphthalmos, extensive
colobomata, and retinal dysplasia. A heterotopic ciliary body had also
developed in the posterior segment of the left eye in the region of the
posterior coloboma. The development of a well-formed ciliary body in the
posterior segment of the eye questions the hypothesis that physical contact
between the lens primordium and neuroepithelium is required for ciliary body
development.<p>
