<H1>Errors in Stolmar's Cosmic Background Model</H1>

<P>
Stolmar's cosmological model uses a tired light redshift.  The Earth is located
in the center of a uniform density sphere of stars extending out to some
maximum radius <EM>R<SUB>max</SUB></EM> which is about 7 or 8 Hubble radii.
The redshift factor <EM>1+z</EM> is exponential with distance,
and thus reaches a
few thousand at the edge of the sphere.  Starlight redshifted by this factor
of a few thousand provides the cosmic background.  However, this model
does not agree with the observations and must be rejected:

<H2>The spectrum is wrong</H2>

<P>
In his <A HREF="http://www2.3dresearch.com/~alistolmar/CMBR.htm">CMB page</A>
on 27 July 2001
Stolmar gave the following equation for the solid angle covered by stars
in a shell with radii between <EM>R<SUB>-</SUB></EM> and
<EM>R<SUB>+</SUB></EM>,
</P><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="./Stolmar_Errors_Eq1.gif" WIDTH=266 HEIGHT=53>
</CENTER></P><P>
where <EM>A</EM> is the area of
a star and <EM>n</EM> is the number density of stars.
Stolmar gave this equation for the energy in the background radiation:
</P><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="./Stolmar_Errors_Eq2.gif" WIDTH=390 HEIGHT=55>
</CENTER></P><P>
where the index <EM>j</EM> is the frequency in GHz.
It is hard to determine exactly what is meant by this equation, 
since it appears to give the odd combination of energy density per unit
wavelength divided by the frequency, but
Stolmar also gave the equation for a blackbody:
</P><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="./Stolmar_Errors_Eq3.gif" WIDTH=292 HEIGHT=55>
</CENTER></P><P>
which can be used to normalize the previous equation.
Now Stolmar also assumes <EM>(1+z) = exp(HR/c)</EM>.  If I take the limit of
infinitesimally small shells in radius, I get a normalized
integral for the specific intensity of the CBR which is
</P><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="./Stolmar_Errors_Eq4.gif" WIDTH=395 HEIGHT=52>
</CENTER></P><P>
where <EM>y = H R/c</EM>,&nbsp;<EM>f</EM> is the frequency in Hz, and
<EM>I<SUB>f</SUB></EM>&nbsp; is in
[erg/cm<SUP>2</SUP>/sec/sr/Hz].
Stolmar prefers to use the doubling time of photon wavelengths,
<EM>H<SUB>d</SUB></EM>, instead
of the Hubble constant <EM>H</EM>, but these parameters are related by
<EM>H = ln(2)/H<SUB>d</SUB></EM>.
This formula has three free parameters: <EM>Anc/H</EM>
determines the overall
intensity scaling, <EM>T<SUB>*</SUB></EM>
determines the frequency scaling, and
<EM>y<SUB>max</SUB></EM> determines the shape of the spectrum.
Note that <EM>Anc/H</EM> is the optical depth per Hubble radius and it is very
small in Stolmar's model 
[the total fraction of the sky covered by stars out to R<SUB>max</SUB>
is roughly one part per trillion]
so the use of the optically thin approximation
here is appropriate.  Also note that Stolmar assumes that all of the power
emitted by the stars at redshift <EM>z</EM> reaches us, but with an apparent
temperature redshifted to <EM>T<SUB>*</SUB>/(1+z)</EM>.
Normally in tired light models
one allows for the loss of photon energy by a factor of <EM>(1+z)</EM>
which would
change the <EM>(1+z)<SUP>4</SUP> = exp(4y)</EM> in the above equations
to <EM>(1+z)<SUP>3</SUP> = exp(3y)</EM>.
The only set of these parameters that agree with the FIRAS data on the CMB
is <EM>y<SUB>max</SUB> &lt; 0.00005,
T<SUB>*</SUB> = T<SUB>o</SUB> = 2.725</EM>&nbsp;K, and
<EM>Anc/H = y<SUB>max</SUB><SUP>-1</SUP></EM>.
In this case the optical depth per Hubble radius is high so one has an
opaque isothermal source: a blackbody.
But <A HREF="./stars_vs_cmb.html">real stars are not blackbodies</A>,
so even this limit will not actually work.
When <EM>y<SUB>max</SUB></EM> is not infinitesimal,
one gets a Rayleigh-Jeans low frequency
tail rising to a peak corresponding approximately to a graybody with
temperature <EM>exp(-y<SUB>max</SUB>)T<SUB>*</SUB></EM>,
a Wien high frequency tail
corresponding approximately to a graybody with
temperature <EM>T<SUB>*</SUB></EM>,
and an <EM>I<SUB>f</SUB></EM>&nbsp; proportional to <EM>f<SUP> -1</SUP></EM>
behavior between these
two tails.  The low frequency tail can approximate a blackbody for an
appropriate choice of <EM>Anc/H</EM>.
But this model can not simultaneously fit the data both above and below
the peak unless <EM>y<SUB>max</SUB></EM> is infinitesimal.
The examples given by Stolmar are extremely inconsistent with the FIRAS
data on the CMB, as shown in Figure 1.
Stolmar's comment about this discrepancy is
"The higher calculated values on the right from the peak require closer
examination of the reported processing of CMBR data".
In other words, blame the data for not agreeing with his theory.
However, these data have been confirmed by a separate experiment: see

Figure 1: Stolmar's model with <EM>T<SUB>*</SUB> = 4000</EM> and 
<EM>R<SUB>max</SUB> = 99</EM>&nbsp;Glyr,
which deviates from the FIRAS data by up to 13,000 standard deviations.
This value of <EM>R<SUB>max</SUB></EM> and
<EM>H<SUB>d</SUB> = 8.468</EM>&nbsp;Glyr give
<EM>y<SUB>max</SUB> = 8.1</EM>
while my best match to Stolmar's curve is with <EM>y<SUB>max</SUB> = 7.7</EM>.
In this plot I use values read from Stolmar's graph.
However, Stolmar recently changed <EM>H<SUB>d</SUB></EM>
and has not updated these figures.

<P>
Since Stolmar's cosmology career on sci.astro started with the announcement
of the DIRBE far IR background, it is interesting to plot his model on a
much wider frequency range and compare not just to the CMB but also to
the <A HREF="./CIBR/">IR and optical backgrounds.</A>
This is shown in Figure 2.
The long <EM>I<SUB>f</SUB></EM>&nbsp; proportional to <EM>f<SUP> -1</SUP></EM>
section becomes a constant when one plots
<EM>f I<SUB>f</SUB> </EM>, and this behavior is quite contrary to the data,
both the detections and the upper limits.

Figure 2: Stolmar's model compared to FIRAS, DIRBE, HST, groundbased and
far UV measurements of the cosmic background.
Since Stolmar's graphs do not extend to such short wavelengths, I have
evaluated my integral version of his equations numerically.

<H2>Stars do not last 100 billion years</H2>

<P>
The stars at the edge of the sphere that produce the peak of the CMB are
radiating at a time that is 7 or 8 Hubbles times ago.  That is nearly
100 billion years, and only very low mass red dwarfs last that long.
But low mass M dwarfs produce very little radiation, and Stolmar's model
requires a lot of radiation.  On 24 July 2001 Stolmar changed his H to 160
km/sec/Mpc, which alleviates this problem but disagrees with the data on
the Hubble constant.
</P>

<H2>We must be in the center of the Universe</H2>

<P>
If we are not in the center of the Universe, a large dipole anisotropy is
produced that has the spectrum of a graybody at temperature
<EM>T<SUB>*</SUB>/exp(y<SUB>max</SUB>)</EM>.  The observed dipole anisotropy
has a different spectrum.  Thus we must be nearly exactly in the center of
the sphere of stars.  A rough analysis of the FIRAS dipole anisotropy
spectrum suggests that we must be centered within Stolmar's sphere of stars
to within 1 part in 100,000 of <EM>R<SUB>max</SUB></EM>, which means that
the Milky Way could be the center, but the center of mass of the Local
Group could not.  Having the sphere of stars centered on the Local
Supercluster is completely ruled out.
