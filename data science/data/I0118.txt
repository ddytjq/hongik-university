Not every top player was wowing the crowds as a six-year-old. Joe certainly wasn't anyway. He didn't even make it into a proper team until he was 11 years old.<br>
"I'd always plyed in the playground but I was never in a team until I was about 11 years old. I don't really know why I didn't start until then. I probably wasn't good enough. I always had a ball at my feet, but I didn't really know about playing in a team., I thought football was something you did in the playground. My first team was Paddington, then I moved to Chapel Boys and stayed there for three years, then to West Ham. I played the same way in those days. Obviously your game changes because the players around you are better, but I basically play the same as I always have done."<p>

Until it's recent closure, a coverted place at the FA National School of Excellence at Lilleshall was every young player's aim. Sol Campbell, Andy Cole, Michael Owen and Joe all went there.<br>
"I was there for two years and it was a great experience. It was hard to leave home, but I made the right choice. You become kind of mini-superstars in youth football when you go there. Young lads around the country know your name, so when you play them they want to kick you but at the school we went to, we got treated differently because we went there as little famous people, a few little Beckhams. We trained every day except Sunday and played on Saturday. No one else in my year has made their first-team debut yet. They'll make it as players, but it's not often you get 17 year olds in the first team. You usually get one from each year. There's been Michael Owen two years above me, Francis Jeffers in the year above me and then myself.<p>

Your debut for your country is surely one of the biggest games you'll ever play. So it's no wonder that Joe's first game for England, against Wales at Under-15 level, is still fresh in his memory.<br>
"It was at Ninian Park, Cardiff, and it was massive, just as big as making your debut for any other team. I look back now and I can still remember how important it felt for all the lads who were playing. I can remember singing the national anthem and all the hairs on the back of my neck were standing on end. I was really nervous, but we had a good side. We were only little, but we still passed the ball well. Schoolboy teams are usually full of big lump[s because they want to win games. But our team was a very good passing side and we showed a few countries how to play football. We didn't get the results we should have because we were lacking a bit of strength, but playing for England is a great feeling and a great honour."<p>

As Joe's name became better known in football circles (Alex Ferguson was keen to sign him), he had to get used to increased media attention.<br>
"I first got in the local papers when I moved into Lilleshall. They took notice because it is such a long time since anyone from my area has done anything like that and from there it's got bigger. I've had my name in the National papers since I was 15 and to begin with it was hard, but you do get used to it. Seeing the media around world class players like Ronaldo doesn't really bother me because I want to get to the top. If I don't like it when I get tothe top there are a lot of things you can do, but until I'm playing at that level I shouldn't even think about it. I certainly won't get carried away. It's still easy to keep your feet on the ground. There's no excuse for going around thinking you're the best or for thinking you're better than you are."<p>

With everyone predicting Joe would be the future of England, he was invited to train with the full squad when he was 17 even before he made his first team debut for West Ham.<br>
"It was great to be invited there. The training was alright, it was just the other times that felt a bit strange. When you're playing football you don't think about who you're passing the ball to, you just play naturally. It was harder just to get settled in. I wasn't sitting there not speaking or anything, but it was harder. I was with Rio Ferdinand and I'd met Jamie Redknapp a few times. Harry probably said to Jamie, 'Look after him', so I was with those two quite a lot, but I got on with everyone. The worst bit was when I was playing golf and I did four air shots on the first tee. THey were a bit cruel to be honest, they put me on first with everyone watching. I play golf more now though, so I've got a bit better."<p>

With England senior training under his belt, Joe got his Hammers debut in the FA Cup match against Swansea, coming off the bench to help his side grab a draw.<br>
"I was cleaning the changing rooms at the ground and Frank Lampard just came in and said, 'Be at the ground for half one', so I turned up and I was on the bench. It was amazing. Everyone in the dressing room was a bit shocked I was in the squad - but I came off the bench and I did really well. The crowd took to me straight away and we got the equaliser, so it was a blinding day for me. After that I made my Premiership debut at Manchester United and had another good game. Then against Wimbledon, I was Man Of The Match. After that the manager used me sparingly until this year when I've got a regular place."<p>

Despite his elevation to the first team, Joe still had a crucial part to play in West Ham's FA Youth Cup run. Back with his mates, he inspired the side to a brilliant 9-0 aggregate win over Coventry in the final and the Cole trophy cabinet had its first medal to show off.<br>
"That was a great experience for me. It's a big competition. Whenever honours get listed throughout your career it's like the FA Cup, League Cup... amd the FA Youth Cup gets thrown in there as well. It's a massive thing in fotball and to do it in such style with the great side we had then was good. Now we've split up and we're going at our own pace in the first team, but I'm sure there'll be lots of them playing soon. I still knock about with the young lads and they still treat me the same way they did when I wasn't in the first team."<p>

Goals had flowed freely throughout Joe's youth career, but in the hurly-burly of the top flight he found it harder. Finally, he hit a last-ditch winner in the Worthington Cup against Birmingham.<br>
"Scoring my first goal at Birmingham was absoloutley blinding-the best felling ever in the world. It felt even better because it was an  important goal, a last-minute winner. I always said if I score it won't be one in a 4-0 rout or a consolation goal or anything like that, it will be important-and it was. So was the next one against Bradford. I know I've only hit the net around twice in twenty games or so, which isn't good enough, but I know it will come. It doesn't bother me really. I think David Beckham's only scored two goals this year, but as long as he's doing hnis bit for the team, it's alright. I know I can score goals, there's no danger there, but hopefully it will come soon. There's no big pressure, though."<p>

Still only 18, Hoe's a first team regular, but he's having to learn quickly. Coming up against quality opposition every week, he's finding out what Premiership footballs all about.<br>
"You just have to do what's required in a game. Some games you can do the wonderful tricks, while in other games you have to get stuck in and work hard. No one player plays exactly the same every game, you just can't do it, you can't do amazing things every game. You might do amazing things ten games on the trot or you might go a whole season without doing anything really spectacular, but as long as you're doing your bit for the team, you're getting stuck in and doing the simple things well, then you've got nothing to worry about. I'm not really bothered about playing against anyone. I just go out and play my own game. It's not the end of the world if I don't play well, it's just a game of football at the end of the day. I always go out and give 100 percent. If it goes well, then that's brilliant. If it doesn't, I'll always be ready for the next game to give 100 percent again fot the team."<p>

As the profile rises, Joe's having to get used to the attention of not just the media, but the public at large. Signing autographs has become a daily occurance for him now.<br>
"I don't know if there was a particular moment when I realised I was famous. Little things sometimes make you notice. When you see people recognize you in a shop or somebody comes up for your autograph, It's just a really nice feeling. It can be strange if a fort five year old asks you for your autograph, but I'm sure I'd like that if I wasn't a footballer. I think often people know my name more than they know my face, but I do get recognized more now. If I walk up and down the street I'm not going to get hounded or anything, sometimes I get people recognize me, but I really enjoy it because it won't be long before I'm thirty-five and no one will want to speak with me anymore."<p>

Speculation was rife that Joe would leapfrog the Under-21'a and go straight from England Under-18's into the full side. But Kevin Keegan decided to give Joe his Under-21 shot first in the recent 1-0 win over Argentina.<br>
"It was good to finally make my debut for the Under-21's and hopefully I can make the step up. It's good to get things like that under your belt. Debut's are never easy because people are always looking at you. We got a good result and it went quite well for me personally. It wasn't outstanding, just a resonable game. I came on at half time when it was 0-0. The crowd always want to see attacking players and I knew some of the crowd were probably there to see me play. It was a good game, a good result, Frank Lampard did very well, so did Lee Hendrie for the goal. It was exciting."<p>

Will he get to Euro 2000? Ow will we have to wait for the 2002 World Cup to see Joe Cole on the big stage? We'll have to wait and see. But one day, Joe will make it.<br>
"People ask me if I think I'll go to Euro 2000, but I don't know. They say if you're good enough, you're old enough, so it's up to me to prove I'm good enough. You can't hide on a football pitch, you've got to go out and prove yourself, but I've still got time on my side. I'll just try to play well for West Ham and I know if Kevin Keegan thinks I can do a job for him, he'll put me in the side. But it's all about me playing well for West Ham. Obviously it would be lovely and I'd snap up the chance if it was there, but at the moment I'm just trying my best for West Ham."<p><!-- text below generated by server.
