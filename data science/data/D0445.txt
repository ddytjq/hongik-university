Notes on changing CLASSPATH</h2>
If you are using an IDE, the IDE might be doing the work of setting up
your CLASSPATH, so you might not have had to deal with it.
<p>The CLASSPATH is an environment variable.&nbsp; The exact method of
setting and changing it is system dependent.&nbsp; In Windows 98, it gets
set in your <tt>autoexec.bat</tt> using a line of the form
<p><tt>SET CLASSPATH=dir1;dir2;dir2;dir4</tt>
<p>In Windows/NT, you can set the CLASSPATH from the control panel's System
panel.&nbsp; In Unix, you would normally set it from your profile (e.g.
.profile or .cshrc file.)&nbsp; If you are not sure, ask someone familiar
with your operating system regarding the method of setting or changing
it.&nbsp; An example of an autoexec.bat line to set classpath is
<p><tt>SET CLASSPATH=C:\MyJspClasses;C:\ThirdPartyClasses</tt>
<p>or even just
<p><tt>SET CLASSPATH=C:\MyJspClasses</tt>
<p>The value of the classpath is one or more entries separated by the semi-colon
character.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each element is the path of a directory (folder)
or the path of a .jar file.&nbsp; Whether the element is a directory or
a .jar file, it contains class files (with the <i>.class</i> extension.)&nbsp;
These class files get loaded by the Java interpreter and utilities.
<p>You may not have a classpath (specially if you are using JDK 1.3,) in
which case you can add one.by adding a line to your autoexec.bat or profile
file, or by adding a new environment variable from your Windows NT control
panel's "System" panel.
<p>If you already have a classpath, you can insert a new directory into
it.
<p>Let us suppose you have modified your classpath and added the path <tt>C:\MyJspClasses</tt>
to it, and have created the <tt>C:\MyJspClasses</tt> directory.&nbsp; (On
Windows 98, you would also need to re-boot your PC so the class path is
in effect.&nbsp; On NT, you would need to start a new command window so
the new class path is picked up.&nbsp; On Unix, logging in again will activate
the changed profile.)
<p>Then you can compile your bean's java file by using the command
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt> javac -d C:\MyJspClasses UserData.java</tt>
<br>which will create the <tt>UserData.class</tt> file directly into <tt>C:\MyJspClasses</tt>
(and would also have created any necessary directory structure if the class
were in a package.)
<p>If you had to change your classpath, typically you will also need to
stop and restart your web-server so it can pick up the new classpath.
