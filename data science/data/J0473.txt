<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Introduction</font></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Hiliclimbs and Sprints are very similar
in concept and operation.&nbsp; Both involve a wide variety of cars, from
Standard Road Saloons to Formula 1 Racing Cars.&nbsp; The cars run singly,
over a clearly defined sealed surface course, timed electronically to a
high degree of accuracy.&nbsp; The general resource requirements, whether
human or equipment, are also very similar, if not identical.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; To make this guideline
simple and easy to understand it is divided into several sections, defining
the further sections to be read, according to circumstance and a Club's
organising experience.</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; References, enclosed in
brackets, are made to MSA General Regulations in the Competitors' and Officials'
Yearbooks (The Blue &amp; Red Books).&nbsp; It is essential that copies
of these publications are available for study by prospective organisers.&nbsp;
The paragraphs noted should be read in conjunction with the appropriate
section of this guideline.</font></b>

<h2>
<a NAME="newclub"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">B. New Clubs</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The organisation of hillclimbs and sprints
differs considerably from other types of event, it is therefore essential
for all organisers to be familiar with the practicalities.&nbsp; To achieve
this, the Club should at the earliest opportunity, preferably not later
than 12 months prior to proposed date:</font></b>
<ol TYPE="a" START="a">
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Appoint the Clerk of the Course and Secretary
of the Meeting</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If they are new to these positions, make
arrangements for them to visit existing events, to examine what is required
and the procedures involved.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Provisionally appoint the remainder of
the principle officials, to assist the CofC and Secretary by visiting other
events to familiarise themselves.</font></b></li>
</ol>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Note:</font> Clerk of the
Course <font size=+1>MUST</font> hold an MSA Official's Licence valid for
the event.&nbsp; Initially it will probably be necessary for arrangements
to be made to 'import' a Clerk of the Course from another club, until such
time as your own CofC can be upgraded (AA).</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">HAS THE PROPOSED VENUE BEEN USED BEFORE?:</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If NO&nbsp; - <a href="#newvenues">Go
to Section C</a>.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If YES - <a href="#newevents">Go to
Section D</a>.</font></b>
<h2>
<a NAME="newvenues"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">C. Events at new
venues</font></b></h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Before using a venue for the first time
it is essential to:</font></b>
<ol>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Inspect proposed venue to ascertain which
type of event is most suitable, that sufficient space exists to lay out
a suitable course and that certain other criteria may be complied with
(D.2.3, D.4.2). The main difference between the Hillclimb and Sprint venues
is that the former should have a significant gradient.</font></b></li>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>&nbsp;
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>&nbsp;
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>&nbsp;
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>&nbsp;
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>&nbsp;<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Essential criteria include:</font></b>
<ol TYPE="a" START="a">
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Course MUST be tarmac, concrete or similar
sealed surface, throughout proposed competitive length.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Start &amp; Finish areas, including the
areas immediately before and after, must have similar surface and be otherwise
suitable.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Adequate paddock space exists for proposed
size of entry (not necessarily tarmac).&nbsp; Paddock may be either before
the start or after the finish. most commonly the former.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Space must also exist in-Vicinity of start
to assemble competing cars.&nbsp; At venues where it is necessary to traverse
the course to return to the paddock a similar area is necessary at the
finish.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Proposed course must not be impeded by
buildings, walls or other structures.&nbsp; Structures alongside the course
may be acceptable, but will probably need barriers erected to avoid competing
cars making contact.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Proposed course should not be part of a
Public Footpath or Bridleway, this may make use impossible.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Suitable space at both start and finish,
adjacent to but at a safe distance from the course, for siting Timekeepers.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Adequate, preferably separate, access for
both competitors and spectators.&nbsp; Many of the former will have trailers.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Adequate space for spectator enclosures,
which MUST be separated from the course at all times.</font></b></li>
</ol>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Club MUST have:</font></b></li>

<ol TYPE="a" START="a">
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Full and complete written agreement with
the owner(s) of all land to be used by the event. (Course to be used, paddock
space and spectator areas).</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Written agreements with owner(s) must include
all financial arrangements, including venue rent, and charges made for
public entrance, car parking, programme sales etc.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Specific insurance cover which owner may
deem necessary, at MoD property in particular.</font></b></li>
</ol>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If requirements in 1 and 2 above are satisfied
proposed course should be inspected by the MSAs Safety &amp; Environmental
Executive.</font></b></li>

<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp; To proceed further without inspection
is futile, as acceptability may depend on amendments being made to the
original proposals and/or work carried out.</font></b>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Before proceeding further, Planning Permission
may need to be sought.&nbsp; Usage may be acceptable under a General Development
Order (known as the 14/28 day rule).&nbsp; Usage under a GDO is however
easily revocable, whereas under a Planning Order it may not be. Discrete
checks should therefore be made with Local Authorities etc, for possible
objectors to Motor Sports events.&nbsp; If the proposed venue is to be
permanent and used fairly frequently, the planning order route may be best,
especially if venue preparation requires considerable financial outlay.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Check for existence of local churches,
or other establishments, which may require quiet at specific times, or
other special requirements.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If all above are reconciled apply for issue
of a Track Licence for the venue. (D. 1.3)</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If MoD property is involved, specific permission
must be obtained from the Officer Commanding the facility and application
made to the nearest Defence Land Agency Office for an MoD licence.</font></b></li>

<a NAME="newevents"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">D. New events at
existing venues</font></b></h2>

<ol>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Before planning events at an existing venue
care should be taken not to compromise the activities of other Clubs already
using the venue, particularly in respect of proposed dates.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If sufficient space exists for variations
of course to exist, common on airfield Sprint venues, check what is covered
by the existing Track Licence.&nbsp; The course you propose to use can
then be devised.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Survey the venue carefully to ascertain
if best use is currently being made of the site in terms of course, paddock
siting, officials' and marshals' parking, spectator areas, etc.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Having satisfied the above you should set
out the logistical details of running YOUR event.</font></b></li>

<ol TYPE=a" START="a">
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">How many cars does the Track Licence allow
on the course at a time.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Is there a return road, or some other way
by which cars can return to the paddock without being driven on the course.&nbsp;
If not, cars will have to be dispatched from and returned to the paddock
in batches.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What space is available for collecting
cars after the finish.&nbsp; This will affect number of cars in a batch.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What size of entry should be aimed for?&nbsp;
How many do other clubs accept? (Remember it is better to start with numbers
which you are sure can be handled.&nbsp; Increases can always be made for
future events).</font></b></li>
