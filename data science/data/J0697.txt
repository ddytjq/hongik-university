<h1>Patient Vasser triumphs in Long Beach</h1>

LONG BEACH, Calif. -- Patience paid off for Jimmy Vasser as he claimed his third
victory of the season at the IndyCar Grand Prix of Long Beach.
<p>
Vasser bided his time behind Gil de Ferran for 101 of the
105-lap race. And when de Ferran suffered a mechanical problem, 
Vasser roared by to victory. 
<p>
&quot;Today was just a great day for our team on the road to the
championship,&quot; said Vasser, who will increase his IndyCar points
lead. &quot;I didn't have the car to win, but I had a good car.
Today, we were good and lucky.&quot; 
<p>
De Ferran had set a single lap record in qualifying Friday,
and then broke his own record Saturday to defend his pole
position. De Ferran's Honda was dominant before the
mechanical problem dropped him to fifth at the end of the race. 
<p>
Parker Johnstone brought home a career-best second, followed by
Penske teammates Al Unser Jr. in third and Paul Tracy in
fourth. 
<p>
Vasser acknowledged that de Ferran had the superior machine for
Sunday's race. Vasser, whose team is owned by former racer Chip
Gnassi and former NFL quarterback Joe Montana, said the team
focuses its race-to-race performance rather than looking at the
championship picture. 
<p>
Johnstone, who appeared as a tow truck driver in last year's hit
movie &quot;Speed,&quot; was tearful after the race. 
<p>
&quot;For the first time in my career, I'm speechless,&quot; said
Johnstone, choking back tears. &quot;This is the fulfillment of a
lifelong dream for someone coming from a working class family.
This is enormous.&quot; 
<p>
At the finish line, the other tearful driver was de Ferran.
&quot;It's sad for this kind of thing to happen. It was a sudden
problem in the engine. It's just a shame.&quot; 
<p>
Unser, who won the last two races at Long Beach, couldn't extend
his modern-day record of six victories in this race. Unser's
record at Long Beach stands as the most wins for any driver at
any track on the series. 
<p>
The victory is not only the third for Vasser, but a clean sweep
of the four IndyCar races run thus far by Honda-powered cars
riding on Firestone tires. Johnstone also runs a Honda, as does
de Ferran. 
<p>
An ugly incident occured between Brazilian Christian Fittipaldi
and rookie Greg Moore of Canada. Fittipaldi and Moore were in a
fight for position when the cars came together through Turn
Seven. The collision severed the right front wheel and
suspension from Moore's car. Emerson Fittipaldi, Christian's
uncle, crashed into Moore, ending his race. 
<p>
Christian Fittipaldi approached the car of Moore, shouting at
Moore and shoving the 20-year-old driver. Moore walked away and
clean-up crews separated the drivers.  According to ABC-TV,
IndyCar has slapped the young Brazilian with a $5,000 fine. 
<p>
Robby Gordon burned and crashed and somehow kept going until the
last three laps of the race. Early in the race, Gordon's car
apparently caught fire, but the gutsy American jumped back in
and kept going. He also crashed later but was able to keep his
car in competition until the final incident. 
<p>
The Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach included 105 laps around a
1.59-mile a temporary road course in Long Beach. It
was the fourth of 16 races in the PPG IndyCar World Series. 
<p>
The next race on the IndyCar slate is the Bosch Spark Plug Grand
Prix at Nazareth, Pa., on April 28.
