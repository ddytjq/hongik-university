<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">B AGGRESSiVE</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Why should somebody be aggressive??? Why not.
No really, we have a message behind the provocational exclamation: design,
invent, create, constuct, build, throw farer, cut, carve, catch boomerangs.
Cross limits if nessesary but try to achieve your boomerang goal. Be Aggressive.</font>

bit out of date.</font>

(2001). We will update this page...</font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I began throwing together with Lorenz,
that's nine years ago. First we tried to copy booms from other people.
We still do that. But our interest for greater range grew and more and
more we designed our own hook-like 'rangs out of plywood with ranges up
to 70/75m. That was four years ago.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Then we got hands on new materials, like
Glasfiber, Paxolin, Polypropylene, ... and our range increased to interesting
90/95m (with Glasfiber). Since then we're trying to get more as you have
never enough. (No not money, I mean distance) Of course we learned from
the others especially Herb Smith and we're always open to try out something
new just to get'em 10m more and here we are opening the horizon, just to
be aggressive.</font>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Occupation: Materials science, in the

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As Tibor mentioned, we began throwing together
in '89 - in a houseworking course, where we were supposed to learn cooking,
sewing and so on. There was also a crafting course, where you could build
things out of wood like little chairs and - boomerangs. In fact, everybody
already had a `rang but me and was throwing in front of the house. Finally,
I made my first one and learned throwing. In '92 we began with LD. Soon
I bought a Challenger III from Volker Behrens, but I could not throw it
until '94. We all know: The Challenger III is the most used and modified
and simply the best LD-Boomerang on this planet. But we are trying to find
our own shapes. We think, however, that especially in the airfoil design
lies the key to increasing distance another couple of meters.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I characterize my own performance in the
following way: 100m: always, 110m:often, 120m: sometimes, 130m: seldom,
140m: every morning before breakfast !</font>
