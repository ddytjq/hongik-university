<b>New appointments</b>
<br><br>
TMB are delighted to announce the following appointments; Mark Bergin has been appointed Director of Sales and Marketing, whilst Alan Kempster-Down has taken on the role as a National Key Account Manager.
<br><br>
                          Mark and Alan both join Sales and Marketing from New
                          Business where Mark was Director and has been with TMB
                          since its launch in 1989. Alan's previous position was
                          a Senior New Business Manager where he worked for eleven
                          years. <br>
                          <br>
                          Bill Dudgeon Managing Director of TMB comments: "Both
                          Mark and Alan have worked in other areas of the business
                          and developed excellent relationships with major introducers.
                          They bring a great deal of knowledge and expertise to
                          their new roles and highlights the importance TMB places
                          on its relationships with our introducers." <br>
                          <br>
In addition, Paul Graham who has worked with Mark as a Senior Underwriting Manager has been promoted to Head of New Business. Paul will report directly to Bill Dudgeon.

<br><br>
<b>Outstanding Results</b>
<br><br>
                          Following hard on the success of previous years TMB's
                          mortgage book reached &pound;4billion in December 2001.
                          <br>
                          <br>
This landmark has been achieved by continuing to offer a comprehensive range of specialist mortgage products designed to help introducers provide more solutions that are suited to the ever changing lifestyles of today's clients.
<br><br>
                          Mark Bergin director of Sales and Marketing comments:
                          "Breaking through the &pound;4billion barrier at such
                          an earlier stage is a milestone we are very proud of. To further enhance these results we were rewarded by
                          winning, for a second time, the Financial Adviser 4
                          Star Award for Service. The continuing increase in business
                          is particularly satisfying and we are looking forward
                          to breaking through the £5billion barrier."
