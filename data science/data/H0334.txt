Welcome to our SciTalk on The Living Skeleton.  It is our pleasure to 
welcome Dr. Heidi Bloom as our presenter (her <a href="http://www.accessexcellence.org/LC/ST/st13presbio.html">biography</a> is archived here for 
your interest).  We also want to thank Carolyn Csongradi for agreeing to 
Host this very interesting SciTalk.  Dr. Bloom will respond to your 
questions about the repair of skeletal system injuries, supplements and bone 
health, bone structure and physiology and other non-medical issues you might 
like to learn more about with reference to the skeletal system.  We suggest 
that you read the <a href="http://www.accessexcellence.org/LC/ST/st13bg.html">background paper</a> for this SciTalk prior to posting 
questions for discussion.  During the course of Dr. Bloom's SciTalk we shall 
occasionally include URL's that will take you to relevant images here at AE 
at The Living Skeleton, which has recently been completed by Carolyn 
Csongradi.  Please note:  due to the structure of the SciTalk discussion 
board it is not possible to include URL links in the text boxes and so to 
"Go To" the relevant images you will need to highlight, copy and paste the 
URL into your browser window, click and GO!  <p><b>Dr. Bloom:</b> In orthopedics we sometimes deal with pathologic 
conditions, while at other times trauma or birth defects form the basis of a 
particular case.  Successful corrective surgery is one of the more 
gratifying treatments in our armamentarium because with it we are able to 
provide a person with an entirely new future in terms of mobility and 
health.   
<p>Last fall I had the opportunity to see a four year-old girl whose mother was 
concerned that one leg was smaller than the other.  On examining her, it was 
evident that rather than smaller, one leg was shorter than the other by 
about 2 centimeters.  She walked perfectly normally.  We obtained XRAYS of 
her pelvis and saw that she had a dysplastic hip.  In other words, one hip 
was dislocated and riding higher than usual on the pelvis, outside of the 
socket (acetabulum).  The acetabulum was very shallow, saucer-shaped rather 
than bowl shaped.  We performed an operation which relocated the femoral 
head and reshaped the acetabulum with additional bone graft, a procedure 
called a Pemberton osteotomy.  She sailed through the surgery and now is 
back walking and running, and her XRAYS show her hip remains in proper 
position within the acetabulum.  If we had not detected this condition, she 
would have had debilitating arthritis in that hip probably by her 
mid-thirties.  She then would have required a total hip replacement. 
Hopefully, none of that will be necessary now.</p>

For example to get a gene that stops the spine from curving,  <p>Please reply, because scoliosis is becoming more often in chilldren and when i grow up i would like to research in to it so that no children would have to go through a major surgery.  I know you probably think im to young to understand things but i would really apreciate any reply  <p>Love From  <p>Angela <br clear=left>

Hi Angela 
To the best of my knowledge the cause of adolescent idiopathic scolosis is still unknown.  We do know through twin studies that idiopathic scoliosis is inheritable.  Identical twins have a higher likelihood of having scoliosis than non-identical twins. But a gene or genes responsible for idiopathic scoliosis are unknown. <br clear=left>

There are many different varieties of scoliosis.  As the name implies, idiopathic adolescent scoliosis occurs in teenagers.  Adult scoliosis comes in two varieties, idiopathic and degenerative.  Adult onset scoliosis occurs with degeneration of the intervetebral discs and subsequent ligamentous laxity.  This phenomenon is independent of osteoporosis, but can certainly occur in the same patient.  Post-menopausal women with certain predispositions can develop osteoporosis.  In the spine, this can be manifest as compression fractures, and these women will have a stooped over appearance when seen from the side.  Hormone replacement therapy (estrogen, progesterone), calcitonin, and bisphosphonates are all drugs which are meant to retard the progression of osteoporosis. <br clear=left>

I'm sorry, I don't know anything about periodontal disease.  I do know that we are always trying to encourage bone healing after fractures or when trying to establish a fusion, such as in the back.  Newer modalities including ultrasound, electrical stimulation, and autologous bone growth factures all have been shown to encourage bone union. <br clear=left>

There are different types of scoliosis affecting different age groups.  Scoliosis in a woman in her 50s or 60s is most likely due to degeneration of the intervetebral discs and ligamentous laxity.  This is not specifically due to lack of calcium, although women in this age group are susceptible to osteoporosis.  Hormnone replacement therapy, calcitonin, and bisphosphonates are all drug therapies designed to retard bone loss with age. <br clear=left>

I am looking up stuff about DNA and so far nothing has helped and then ya'll started to talk about how it could be causing bone problems.

<b>hi</b><p>I am replying to your question . I do think that they might fine a gene that may stop scoliosis. You then again you get mostly all your gene and DNA from both sides of your parents . Maybe they can fine something else besides other genes tostop it they might fine cells to kill it without being cut                                                                   but you have all my blessings  <p>truly yours
