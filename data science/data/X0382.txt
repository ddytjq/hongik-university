        <p>Most players have arrived and played the course.
        Weather has been very warm, but not as bad as MN. the
        course is very challenging with some OB that is &quot;the
        Amazon on the Alps.&quot; No hope of finding...ever. The
        greens are very tough with all having a good bit of slope
        and OB threat. Match play will be very strategic. More
        practice and opening ceremonies for the games in Akita
        City tomorrow.</p>
        <p><strong>8/16</strong></p>
        <p>All players now have arrived. Morning practice for
        most, then to the Opening Ceremonies....Opening was
        amazing, Olympic-style gala. Looked like all of Akita was
        involved. Some great freestyle from Bill Wright and Larry
        Imperiale stole the show... Juliana Korver is the
        flagbearer for WFDF and disc sports. 16:00 staff and
        player meeting covered all competition arrangements in
        great detail.</p>
        <p><strong>8/17</strong></p>
        <p>05:00 Weather calm and clear. Opening golf ceremony at
        08:30 featurde bands and many dignitaries. Players were
        all introduced to much fanfare. Word was that Jesper
        Lundmark of Sweden had hurt his back in practice
        yesterday, but was feeling ready to play today. The 25
        hour plane ride may have affected him.</p>
        <p>13:00</p>
        <p>Round One featured a quick upset in womens as Niloofar
        Mossava Rahmani of Sweden surprised most by taking Elaine
        King of Canada 3 holes to 2 won.</p>
        <p>Round Two had Juliana Korver of USA in a tie with
        Elaine as each won only a single hole each.</p>
        <p>19:00</p>
        <p>Very close matches in the afternoon rounds. Check the
        match scores to see how close they were. There were
        several notable upsets. Barry Schultz and Juliana Korver
        made it into the medal round. A three-way tie in the
        men's division between Michael Sullivan of Canada, Yusaku
        Yoshino of Japan, and Jesper Lundmark of Sweden was
        broken based on the match results among the three
        players. Michael Sullivan had won the most holes, and
        beaten each of the other players head-to-head. That puts
        Michael against Barry in the men's gold medal final
        Saturday. Jesper and Yusaku will play for the bronze. In
        the women's, Juliana and Niloofar will play for the gold.
        Elaine King of Canada and Ruth Steele of Great Britain
        will play for the bronze. Finals update will be tomorrow
        after the awards ceremony (about 20:00).</p>
        <p><strong>8/18</strong></p>
        <p>04:00</p>
        <p>Some thoughts on yesterday. It was really tough:</p>
        <p>Strong players in every match up.OB threat on almost
        every shot which made every throw a potential hole and
        match breaker. Hot, humid conditions. Lots of camera
        crews and other distractions. Many very long, critical
        drives with virtually all demanding a particular flight
        path and landing angle. Forty five competitive holes plus
        five warm ups. Net result was a very, very challenging
        test of hand, head and heart. Many of the tight scores
        were epic battles. Imagine Juliana and Elaine punching it
        out to a tie with each of them only winning one hole of
        the nine. On the board it looks like Derek Robbis of
        Britain got killed, but he played some great golf. In
        particular, his match with Yusaku was brilliant. Derek
        canned a 30 meter putt around protecting trees to steal a
        hole in front of a big hometown crowd<em> and a </em>bunch
        of IOC suits who had come to observe. </p>
        <p>Today:</p>
        <p>These final rounds are 18 holes. Juliana is on her
        game, but Niloofar has been consistently surprising. She
        could find a way. Elaine and Ruth tied in their prelim
        match. You may have to bet Elaine on history, but don't
        bet too much. Ruth is coming on. The match for 5th will
        draw a big home crowd pulling for Naoko, but her prelim
        match with Ruby was dead even. It could be a crowd
        thriller.</p>
        <p>For Gold in the Men's we have a classic. The prelim
        match came down to the last hole with Barry snatching a
        crucial win. He's got to be favored, but Michael may be
        looking to put a gold cap on his career. Don't bet money
        you can't afford to lose. In the Bronze match, we have
        two guys who were each only a single shot out of the gold
        match. Yusahu has a big following and kept Jesper out of
        Gold by a surprising 3/2 win in the prelims. It could go
        all 18 for the last medal. The medals are awesome btw,
        locally crafted and reportedly costing more than a small
        car.The match for 5th will be well worth watching. Simon
        has been playing very strong and getting better daily.
        Remember that he's coming right out of the New Zealand
        winter season. MN and Japan weather has been a shock. On
        the other hand, Britain has never really felt right about
        Kiwi independence and this is Derek's chance to put a big
        win on his World Games card. </p>
        <p>The schedule today is packed well into the night and
        the ultimate teams are also here now, but we'll try to
        get you a report of at least the numbers as soon as we
        can get the connection. Wish you were here.</p>
        <p>19:00</p>
        <p>Wow! It was as advertised. Check the results below.
        Special highlights included an amazing 4- hole playoff
        for the men's bronze. Both Jesper and Yusaku repeatedly
        canned long putts to keep it alive. The gallery was crazy
        in love with the idea of a bronze for Japan, but Jesper
        had one great drive too many for Yusaku and he finished
        it on hole 4. Major surprises included Ruth Steele's
        bronze win over Elaine King and Niloofar's pressure of
        Juliana down to the very last putt. The IWGA president
        was in the gallery for the women's gold finish and was
        &quot;amazed&quot; at the quality of play. Simon and
        Derek were dead even untill Simon won three straight to
        take 5th.Ruby also took 18 holes to take 5th from Naoko.</p>
        <p>The award ceremony was Olympic caliber, complete with
        flag raising, anthems and three-level award stands. The
        sayonara party calls. Ultimate begins tomorrow.</p>
