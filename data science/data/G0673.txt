<Table><td><b>
Quasi-Stellar Objects, QSOs, or quasars are believed to be the most distant 
and luminous objects in the Universe.  Quasars were discovered in 1963 as 
radio telescopes began to be able to pinpoint  sources of radio waves more 
precisely. Observations of an occultation of the radio source 3C273 by the 
moon made by Cyril Hazard and colleagues showed that the position of the radio 
source was coincident with a 12th magnitude stellar object (about 250 times 
fainter than can be seen by eye, but bright by astronomical standards).  
Normal stars like the sun are known not to be strong radio sources so 3C273 
and other similar "radio stars" were dubbed <i>Quasi-Stellar Radio Sources</i>
soon shortened to <i>quasar</i>.  We now know that there are about 15 times 
as many quasars which are not strong sources of radio waves as there are radio 
quasars.</td><td>

The first spectrum of 3C273 was obtained by Caltech's Maarten Schmidt using 
the Palomar 200" telescope.  Schmidt puzzled over the photographic spectrum 
for months before he recognized that the strong, broad emission lines in the 
star were the familiar hydrogen-Balmer series, but redshifted by 15%.  It was 
not the 15% redshift that had puzzled Schmidt, galaxies were already known 
with much larger redshifts, but rather the brightness of 3C273.  3C273 was a 
thousand times brighter than even a very luminous galaxy would appear at a
distance of 2 billion light years, corresponding to a redshift of 15.8%.

Soon even higher redshift quasars were discovered - there has been a 
longstanding tradition that the discoverer of the highest redshift quasar
is awarded a case of champagne.  For a time UCSD's Margaret Burbidge held the 
record.  The current

Record Breaking Redshift 5.5 Quasar:</u> The red stelloar object at the center 
of the upper panel is the quasar,<br> whose spectrum is shown in the lower 
panel.  The feature marked <i>Ly <sub><img src="./images/doodads/alpha_b.gif">
</sub></i> is the n = 2 --> n=1 emission feature <br>of hydrogen shifted by 
550% from a rest wavelength in the ultraviolet to 8000 &aring;.  The faintness 
of the spectrum<br> below 8000 &Aring; is caused by absorption from 
intergalactic hydrogen clouds along the line-of-sight to the quasar.
</Center></font>
<p>
A redshift of 5.5 (550%) corresponds to a velocity of 95% of the speed of 
light, or a distance 
of about 14 billion light-years. [The formula for redshift and velocity given 
in the WebPage on <a href="./Distances.html">Distances</a> is only accurate 
when v is much smaller than the speed of light; as 
v <sub><img src="./images/doodads/to.gif"></sub> c 
the redshift gets larger and larger such that the shift is infinite for v=c.]

<p>
The large distances and extreme brightness of the quasars implies tremendous 
energy output; how do they do that?  The question was complicated by the 
discovery that quasars <a href="http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/agn/vary.html">
vary in brightness</a>, sometimes by huge amounts in 
periods as small as a week or so.  There is a simple argument that the size of 
a variable, luminous object cannot be larger than the distance that light 
travels during its time of variation (<i>i.e.</i> if an object varies 
significantly in brightness over a period of a week, it cannot be larger than 
a light-week in size.

Suppose the "quasar" above flashed in brightness like a photographic
flash.  Light would begin travelling from all three points at the same time, 
but light from the center of the quasar would always be a light week behind
light emitted from the front.  Light from the center would reach an observer
a week after detection of light from the front, and light from the back of the 
quasar would be detected another week later.  This "flash" would be observed as
a rise and fall in the brightness over a two week period. </b></td></Table>

<Font size=+1 color="burgundy"><i>The variability of 3C273, 3C279 and other

<td><b><Font size=+1 color="burgundy"><u>Superluminal Motion</u></Font><br>
A further puzzle was provided when radio astronomers pointed global 
<a href="./Radio_Tel.html#VLBI">VBLI (Very Long Baseline Interferometer)</a>
networks with milli-arcsecond resolution at radio quasars.  Every few years 
these quasars go through an outburst, apparently ejecting blobs of synchrotron 
plasma outward.  When radio astronomers follow these outbursts, the blobs of
radio emitting plasma appear to move outward at speeds that are sometimes as 
much as 10 times the speed of light.  This phenomenon called <i>superluminal 
motion</i> or <i>super-relativistic expansion</i> suggests that quasars are 
violating the Special Theory of Relativity.  No one believes this to be the 
case, and there is a straight-forward explanation which is consistent with
Relativity.  This explanation requires that the blobs of synchrotron plasma be 
shot out almost, but not quite, exactly toward us.  </td></Table>

Black Holes &amp; Quasars</u></Font>
<p><table><td><b>
Most astronomers believe that the most likely explanation of the tremendous 
energy output from quasars and small size is that quasars are powered by the 
release of gravitational energy from material falling into a massive black 
hole.  The evidence that black holes inhabit the centers of massive galaxies 
is increasing.
</td><td><img src="./images/Mbh_vs_Mbul.gif"></td></table>
<p>
In this case Einstein's famous equation becomes:
<p><Center>
<font color=burgundy size =+2>
				E ~ 0.1 mc<sup>2</sup>
</font></Center>
<p>
which is to say that material falling into a black hole near the nucleus of 
a galaxy may release up to about 10% of its rest energy in the form of 
gravitational potential energy transformed into x-rays, relativistically 
moving particles, etc.  which produce the phenomena that we see.  Some 
astronomers speculate that stars which orbit to near the central quasar may 
be first puffed up by the intense radiation field, then tidally disrupted by 
the intense gravitational field, and finally pulled into a swirling disk of 
accreted material which will eventually be swallowed by the massive central
black hole.
