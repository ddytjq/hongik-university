<h3><a name="detail">The Sessions in Detail</a></h3>



<dl>
<dt><strong>Andrei Alexandrescu</strong>
<dd>Andrei is a Development Manager with RealNetworks, Inc. He is a columnist
for C++ Report, a former contributor to C/C++ Users Journal, and the
author of the upcoming book "Design with C++" (tentative title), Addison
Wesley Longman, Reading, MA. Andrei holds an MS degree in Electronics
from the Polytechnic University of Bucharest.
<dt><strong>Improving Reuse in C++ Through Policy Classes -
  Example: Designing The Smart Pointer of the 2000s</strong>
<dd>This tutorial has a worthy goal: together, the presenter and the attendees
will implement a generic smart pointer, a highly functional piece of
code that sports configurable behaviours and an amazing rate of reuse.<br>
Smart pointers are hard to get right. But because they nicely automate
things that are hard to manage by hand, smart pointers are an essential
ingredient of robust C++ applications. As small as they are, smart
pointers can make the difference between failure and success. The
implementation presented uses a new class design technique - Policy
Classes. Policy Classes are specialised structural and behavioural
entities that decide one well-defined aspect of a complex behaviour. The
advantage of policy classes is that they can be combined freely in
concrete classes, thus leading to combinatorial reuse. Through only
six mixable-and-matchable policy classes, SmartPtr achieves about 160
different predefined behaviours. Clients can define their own policies.

<dt><strong>Duncan Booth</strong>
<dd>Duncan graduated as a Computer Scientist from Cambridge University and
initially worked for Torch Computers using BCPL, C and Assembler before
joining the fledging RCP as the third employee in 1984. Duncan has worked
on many projects in RCP, including foreign exchange dealing, real-time
financial data, banking back office systems, and healthcare systems. His
interest in Python was first sparked at a science fiction convention,
since when it has become a major player in his choice of languages. As
well as writing in Python he also ported it to the Psion 5 handheld.
He is currently developing applications for web and WAP browsers, mostly
using Python and Zope.
<dt><strong>Using Python on the Web</strong>
<dd>Python is a language well suited to developing web applications. This
presentation covers all aspects of Python's role in web development. The
standard distribution includes good support for retrieving and processing
web data, allowing simple client-side applications with minimal
coding. Support for server-side applications is covered from simple CGI
scripts, through minimal web servers right up to Zope, a full-blown
web application server written in a mixture of Python and C. Finally
JPython provides an almost seamless integration between Python and Java,
allowing the developer to choose the most appropriate tool for the job.

<dt><strong>Beman Dawes</strong>
<dd>Beman is a senior software developer and the author of the
StreetQuick=AE geographic atlas software library.  Beman runs the
Boost.org C++ Libraries web site.  He has been a voting member of the
ANSI/ISO C++ Standards Committee since 1992, and chaired the Library
Working Group for the past five years.
<dt><strong>Introducing Boost and the Boost C++ Libraries</strong>
<dd>The Boost.org web site provides a repository of free, peer-reviewed,
C++ libraries.  The emphasis is on portable libraries which work well
with the C++ Standard Library.  Several may eventually go into the
next revision of the C++ Standard Library.  Begun by a few programmers
from the C++ Standards Committee's Library Working Group, Boost now
has several hundred participants.  This talk introduces Boost, and
describes the current Boost libraries, libraries under development,
and how programmers can participate.  Who is it intended for?
<dt><strong>Who is it intended for?</strong>
<dd>C++ programmers interested in learning about the current Boost
libraries, or int erested in contributing to future Boost libraries.

<dl>
<dt><strong>Francis Glassborow</strong>
<dd>Francis is a member of the BSI C, C++ and Java Standards Panels
    and a regular member of the UK delegations to the ISO work groups
    for these languages. He presents training in C and C++ and was a
    regular columnist for EXE. He has been a member of ACCU since 1988
    and has edited its principle publication C Vu since 1990.
<dt><strong>Panel: meet the News Group Gurus</strong>
<dd> -

<dl>
<dt><strong>Dan Kirkpatrick</strong>
<dd>Based in Aberdeen, Scotland, Dan Kirkpatrick is a software architect and
trainer with Blue Lotus Software, a consultancy specializing in the
development of cutting-edge technologies for server-side and client-side
applications.  As an expert in J2EE, J2SE, XML, and C++, Dan lectures  
internationally on the development of Java applications and XML application
frameworks.  Dan holds degrees in electrical engineering, computer science,
and applied math from Rice University, and has been programming 
professionally since 1988.
<dt><strong>Java 2, Enterprise Edition (J2EE): Comparing J2EE to .NET</strong>
<dd>The introduction of Java 2, Enterprise Edition (J2EE), has established Java
as a dominant language for enterprise application development.  The J2EE
platform provides capabilities for dynamic web content, asynchronous and
synchronous computing, directory services for networked services, and much
more.  The .NET platform, recently introduced by Microsoft, offers many
enterprise application capabilities that are similar to J2EE.  In this talk,
the speaker will introduce all aspects of the J2EE platform, and will
compare and contrast J2EE to .NET for enterprise application development.

<dt><strong>Andy Robinson (replaces John Grayson)</strong>
<dd>Further details shortly...
<dt><strong>Introducing Python</strong>
<dd>Python is an increasingly popular object oriented interpreter, invented by
Guido van Rossum in 1990. This presentation will introduce the audience
to the language, highlighting the features which make it valuable in a number
of application areas. In particular, the applications where Python is appropriate
will be contrasted with cases where Python is not intended to be used. Several
examples of Python applications will be presented, including system administration
tasks, GUIs and other effective applications.

<dl>
<dt><strong>Alan Griffiths</strong>
<dd>Alan Griffiths is a senior developer at Experian, Chair of the ACCU
and a member of the BSI C++ Panel.  He has been working in C++ since the
late 1980's and in Java since they first became generally  available.
You can find details of some his published work by visiting his website
(<a href="http://www.octopull.demon.co.uk/">http://www.octopull.demon.co.uk</a>).
<dt><strong>Exception Safety in Java</strong>
<dd>The fact that the compiler forces programmers to deal with exceptions
in Java leads to a presumption that they are dealt with correctly.
This is not always true - for without a clear idea of the objectives
it is easy to go astray.  This talk covers several definitions of 
"exception safety" and illustrates techniques for achieving them in your
code.
</dl>
<hr width="10%">

<dl>
<dt><strong>Kevlin Henney</strong>
<dd>Kevlin Henney is an independent consultant and trainer specialising
in C++, Java, OO, design, patterns and software architecture. He is a
regular conference speaker, article contributor, and is a columnist for
C++ Report and Java Report.
<dt><strong>Keynote: Minimalism</strong>
<dd>Software development is about many things, one of which is the management
of complexity. It is a lesson that has been oft repeated, but apparently
not as often heeded. The inherent complexity of a software system is
something that we can do little about; we cannot eliminate it, but we
can hide and abstract it. We can also create complexity.<br>
The belief that "less is more" seems to be recognised more in its breach
than in its observance. It seems a common enough piece of advice from
which we can learn and shape our software, from large-scale components
down to individual program statements.<br>
This talk sets out to explore how attention to a more minimal approach
affects the practice of writing software and the quality of written
software in a development culture obsessed with quantity and productivity
by numbers.

<dl>
<dt><strong>Chris Hills</strong>
<dd>A Technical Specialist with Hitex (UK) he is also a member of the
    BSI C panel.  Over the last two decades, Chris has worked on embedded
    projects, from both the hardware and software sides, from smart cards to
    multi-processor SDH systems (PPC based).  He has been involved in many
    practical reviews of tools and project requirements.  Currently he advises
    many projects on the suitability of various debug and testing strategies.
<dt><strong>SCIL - a simple way of grading embedded projects and embedded test
            and debug tools</strong>
<dd>The Safety, Complexity, Integrity Level is a simple method of
    grading embedded projects as a whole and the tool requirements for
    testing them as a whole.  SCIL can also be used to grade embedded
    tools and indicates their suitability for various types of work. The
    SCIL system can be used to indicate to a sub-contractor the level of
    testing and the standard of tools required to achieve it. It wil also
    stop the use of inappropriate tools and methods.  Eventually tools
    will be SCIL graded.  This system is not language, industry sector
    or processor specific. The SCIL project is still in it's initial
    stages but has already gained much interest.

<dl>
<dt><strong>Jon Jagger</strong>
<dd>Jon is a product consultant at QA Training, responsible for their C++ and
C training courses. He is a member of the C++ and C UK standards panels
and a regular contributor to the ACCU Overload journal. He is married
with three beautiful children. He has worked for British Aerospace and
NTL and has experience of real-time digital TV software under UNIX. His
interests include training, design, problem solving, and Monty Python
(which he says is required knowledge for all software developers; forget
the technical interview, just recite the parrot sketch!) He doesn't really
know what else he should say in a short bio such as this. He's very,
very good at sleeping.  And breathing. Both of which he practices a lot.
<dt><strong>C#: First Thoughts</strong>
<dd>The main thrust of this talk is to introduce experienced programmers in
other languages to the new Microsoft language.
<dt><strong>C# in detail</strong>
<dd>In this presentation I will discuss the new C# language from Microsoft.
I will make detailed comparisons between C# and C++ and also between
C# and Java.  These comparisons will cover the whole of the C# language,
from the fundamental types right through to some of the key framework classes.
These comparisons will give delegates with a knowledge of C++ or Java a
strong feel for the language and its capabilities.  I will also explain
how C# relates to the .NET platform and consider topics such as Intermediate
Language, .NET DLL modules, and .NET assemblies.

<dt><strong>Nicolai Josuttis</strong>
<dd>Nico is well known for his new book about the C++ standard library, which
became a best-seller and de-facto standard on this subject in a very short
time. He is an active member of the C++ Standard Committee and has written
several books on object-oriented programming and C++. He is member of
the editorial board of "C++ Report" and a partner of the System Bauhaus,
a German group of recognised object-oriented system development experts.
He works as self-employed trainer, consultant and systems architect.
<dt><strong>Traps and Pitfalls of the C++ Standard Library</strong>
<dd>The C++ Standard Library was a big step to enable programmers to use
general components and a higher level of abstraction of C++ without
losing portability, rather than having to develop all code from scratch.
However, the library provides a lot of flexibility, and flexibility for
nontrivial purposes has a price. Beware that the library has traps and
pitfalls. This talk shows the most important of them and suggests ways
of avoiding them.
<dt><strong>C++ Templates: Concepts, Design, and Practice</strong>
<dd>C++ is a multi-paradigm language. One paradigm is the generic paradigm
provided by the templates technique.  Due to the availability of standard
conforming systems and experience with templates we are just beginning to
understand the whole picture of the power of generic programming with templates.
One aspect is the ability to implement polymorphism in a different way.
Instead of using a base class, a template parameter is used.  This has important
consequencies.  For example, patterns such as the famous bridge pattern
may be implemented totally differently.  This talk covers this subject,
discusses pros and cons, and provides some examples.

<dl>
<dt><strong>Dietmar K&uuml;hl</strong>
<dd>Dietmar works as consultant and software architect at Phaidros Software
AG, a company turning UML models into ready to use software. He is an
active member of the ISO C++ committee, a moderator of the newsgroup
comp.lang.c++.moderated, and has written an implementation of a large
portion of the standard C++ library.
<dt><strong>Implementing the C++ Standard Library</strong>
<dd>The standard C++ library is no different from any other library when
it comes down to user expectations: In the first place the library
implementation has to be correct but this is not the end of the
story. Using the library should have minimum impact on the compile time
and executable size while the resulting executable should be as fast as
possible. This talk presents techniques which the speaker uses in his
implementation of the Standard C++ Library implementations to address
these expectations.

<dt><strong>Angelica Langer</strong>
<dd>I teach C++ related topics as a freelancer in Europe and the US. I'm
a recognised speaker at various international conferences, among them C++
World, OOP, TOOLS. I'm a columnist for C++ Report and a member of the C++
standards committee and co-author of the book "Standard C++ IOStreams
and Locales". A more comprehensive biography can be found on my web page
(<a href="http://www.langer.camelot.de/">http://www.langer.camelot.de/</a>).
<dt><strong>Standard C++ Locales</strong>
<dd>The Standard C++ Library includes a framework for internationalisation
of C++ programs in form of locales and facets.  The locale framework
is used by the standard stream I/O classes for internationalised I/O,
but is designed to be of more general use.  The standard facets provide
support for culture dependent formats of date and time, monetary amounts,
language-dependent sorting of strings, and other culture-dependencies. In
addition to the standard facilities, the locale framework is extensible
and can serve as a vehicle for special-purpose culture-dependencies such
as address formats, shoe sizes, or temperature-, measure-, or currency
conversions.<br>
In this tutorial we will explore the standard facets and will learn
how to add user-defined internationalisation services to the standard
locale framework.
<dt><strong>Prerequisites</strong>
<dd>Participants should have at least 1 year of working
knowledge of C++; knowledge of internationalization services in C will
help, but are not required.

<dt><strong>Alan Lenton</strong>
<dd>Alan Lenton is in charge of game design and development and overall
technical matters for Interactive Broadcasting. Alan handles all the
design for new and existing games, and the programming for new games. He
also has responsibility for managing other programmers doing maintenance
work and writing game tools.<br>
Alan has extensive management, publishing and software design experience,
having worked as the manager of a rock band, manager of a bookshop,
a graphic designer, and the production editor of a London listings
magazine. He was for three years general manager of the UK's first
commercial consumer network Compunet, before leaving to concentrate on
writing IB's award-winning multi-player game Federation.<br>
Multi-player games designed by Alan include Federation, an
adventure/economic simulation set in a future universe; Iron Wolves,
a submarine simulation; and the recently released Age of Adventure,
a role-playing game based in Victorian times.<br>
Alan has a degree in sociology from Leeds University, which is probably
one of the reasons why Interactive Broadcasting's games create true
communities, so that IB's multi-player games become real cyberspace
societies. Alan has been known to refer to himself as the world's only
practising sociologist!
<dt><strong>Developing Open Source Software</strong>
<dd>Recently, putting software into Open Source seems to have become a panacea
for the woes of struggling software companies. It isn't. In many ways
developing open source software is much more difficult than developing
closed source software.<br>
As well as the obvious requirements of good programming style and a solid
technical knowledge, developing open source software requires a well
suppressed ego, tact, and an ability to know when to compromise and when to
draw a line. Not characteristics usually associated with programmers! It is
perhaps not for nothing that a commentator once referred to Linus Torvalds
as the Open Source Movement's 'cat-herder-in-chief'.<br>
This session will not only look at these issues but also at the nature of
code developed for open Source and the tools developed by the movement - 
rpm, cvs, gnatts, autoconf, automake, and libtools. It will also look at 
some of the implications of open source licences like the GPL.

<dd>Twelve years experience in software development with both conventional

business applications. Used various languages (Fortran, Pascal, Basic,
C/C++ and Java) on range of platforms (VAX/VMS, Pick, Windows and IBM
Mainframe running MVS/CICS).<br>
Having worked as an independent contractor for the last two years,
now settled once again in permanent employment with Intercede Limited,
who specialise in information security.
<dt><strong>Exploring interfaces - a C++ perspective</strong>
<dd>To understand how to design interfaces effectively in C++, we must
delve into the themes that run through the best-practice use of the
language. This is highlighted by the (often subtle) effect that modern
C++ features - exceptions and templates for example - have on the way
interfaces are designed. The aim of this talk is to explore the issues,
principles and techniques that motivate the way interfaces are designed
in modern C++.

I'm a member of the French national body organization for standardisation
(AFNOR) delegation in WG21 (since 1997), and I'm the French delegate in
WG11 (since 1998).<br>
I began lobbying for C++ in scientific computations since 1996 when
I worked on the European scientific project FRISCO (Framework for
Numerical and Symbolic Computations) -- I worked at INRIA Sophia Antipolis
(France).<br>
I implemented the numerical components of the new GNU libstdc++-v3<br>
Currently I'm working, for CodeSourcery LLC[2], on the C++ front-end
of GCC.  I'm also the co-maintainer of libstdc++-v3.
<dt><strong>Expressing Constraints a la Standard ML Signatures</strong>
<dd>Our purpose here is to demonstrate how constraints a la SML
can be approximated in C++. After a brief exposition of abstract
classes as interfaces in C++, we show why that scheme doesn't fit
some static requirements. Then we move on considering some template
techniques. Finally we discuss their limitations.
<dt><strong>Metaprogramming in C++: a type calculi point of view.</strong>
<dd>We want to emphasise the algebraic aspect of metaprogramming in C++
based on template techniques. In particular, we adopt the viewpoint that
type names are actually template-names of 0-arity. That enables us to
shed a light on the ideas behind template techniques as means of doing
metaprogramming in C++.

C++ and the forthcoming More Exceptional C++ (Addison-Wesley). He 
is also the creator of patents covering several dozen innovations 
in the fields of distributed database design and organization,    
distributed network organization, and cryptographic security for  
databases.
<dt><strong>Namespaces & the Interface Principle</strong>
 (for C++ programmers interested in robust software engineering)
<dd>This talk analyzes namespaces and name lookup in C++, and shows how C++'s
naming rules affect sound class and module design. The talk covers Koenig
lookup, the Interface Principle, and some perhaps surprising name lookup
gotchas, and shows how to create robust designs that avoid the pitfalls.
<dt><strong>Optimizing "Plain" and "Multithreaded" C++ Code</strong>
 (for Programmers interested in efficient coding style and multithreaded
optimization issues)
<dd>This talk answers the following questions: How can you identify and
eliminate unnecessary temporary objects? How can you reduce compile- time
dependencies to improve encapsulation and build speed? Will inlining make
your code smaller or bigger, slower or faster, and why? It concludes
with an in-depth examination of "copy-on-write," and shows why some
optimizations are only good in single-threaded programs and can cause
serious performance problems in a multithreaded environment.
<dt><strong>KEYNOTE: Pitfalls of the software of the software industry</strong>
<dd>If you have an appetite for controversy, welcome to the software
development industry.  Step right in!  From language wars and standards
skirmishes, to Why 2K and antitrust actions, we have it all.  Hugely
entertaining as it can be, however, the problem is that the misspent energy
often gets in the way of getting important things done.  Worse still,
it distracts us from the true role of our industry in, and its value to,
our society.  This talk is a reflection on the meaning and future of our
industry in the first decade of the 21st century.

secure portability and distribution, and "The Java Platform" provides an
introduction to the numerous APIs, covering everything from 3D graphics
to wireless communication, which make up the Java platform."

<br>Considering Access in Design</strong>
<dd>The purpose of this panel discussion is to consider the broad issues
relating to use of access specifiers together with 'friend'. Some of
the questions that will be addressed are 'Should nested classes have
access to the private members of the enclosing class?', 'Should virtual
functions be private/protected?" and "When is public data desirable?"<br>
The background to this discussion is a proposal to change the rules for
access for nested classes so that they will always have access to the
private and protected interfaces of the enclosing class.

<br>C++ Standard Library: Changes, Corrections and Future Extensions</strong>
<dd>The ISO C++ Standard Library is 368 pages of complex software
specification, so errors or requests for interpretation are no surprise.
In the nearly three years the standard has been complete, over 230
such issues have surfaced.  While most are just typos, minor defects,
or not actually defects, a few do represent fairly serious defects in
the standard.  In this talk three active members of the C++ Standards
Committee's Library Working Group present defects they consider
noteworthy.
