      <P>As a member of several area car clubs, I always do my best
      to remain enthused about someone's idea for a road rally or a
      &quot;motoring tour&quot; in the Ocala National forest (where
      all the roads are straight and run to perceived compass points)
      or on this or that local road around the sinkholes developers
      and Chambers of Commerce call &quot;lakes.&quot; The truth is,
      that Florida roads totally lack any soul, ups, downs, twists,
      turns, or potential for &quot;I'm sorry I did that!&quot; thoughts
      immediately preceded by a bout with massive oversteer or impolite
      understeer.</P>

      <P>My favorite writers, David E. Davis and Peter Egan, are more
      than monthly acquaintances of mine; we are truly kindred spirits.
      There's a special place in the hereafter reserved where our dreams
      of narrow tires, spoked wheels, and external hand brakes...dreams
      of hats askew, and frost in our graying whiskers with faces wind-tanned
      while our deerskin gloved hands deliberately focus the 16-inch
      laminated walnut steering wheel of a &quot;real&quot; roadster
      ... will all come true! We'll drive roads where no 18-wheeler
      has <BR>
      gone before and the only sound you hear is the honesty of a carburated
      motor and its muffled and catless exhaust. The trouble is, I
      suspect those fine gentlemen &quot;do&quot; live that life while
      I am enduring Florida sand blast, love-bugs, and the road noise
      of the masses who have recently arrived from places with more
      soulful byways.</P>

      <P>It's not as though we have to stay here. The family homestead
      in Northwestern Connecticut has the best roadster roads in the
      entire northeast. I belong in a throwback MG or Allard or something
      with real wood parts. I belong meandering out there on that never-ending
      back road deemed unsuitable for trailered vehicles and which
      has never seen a speed limit sign...one where you are as likely
      to meet up with a horse-drawn hay wagon as any other vehicle.
      I need to dump the antiseptic security of Japanese and German
      technology and efficiency and return to the impracticality of
      something Italian or British made by men who drank beer at lunch
      in the early '50's. I need to get away from the &quot;coast-to-coast&quot;
      (of Florida) rallies and go smell the damp woods and wood fires
      of Hometown, USA. I want a tire with a tube and a hand pump in
      the boot. I need a renewed dose of heroes...men whose hands and
      feet drive and not simply focus and aim hydraulically assisted
      parts, computers, and other gizmos that tell a wiper blade when
      to <BR>
      make a pass. I want to be wet and cold as I curse ill-fitting
      side curtains and try desperately to free up an overtightened
      knockoff as I wonder what ever possessed me to leave that brass
      weighted hammer on the work bench. The same hammer that I count
      on for any necessary fuel line and carb adjustments....</P>

      <P>But it's a beautiful day in Orlando, this April 12 of year
      2000. And there are roads that are almost fun once you follow
      an interstate to find them...and the German or Japanese technology
      will get me there and back in a dependable yet soulless manner
      on tubeless tires; and yet, if I take a certain backroad that
      overpasses an interstate...in my dreams it's a hill...and David
      and Peter are close on my tail!</P>
