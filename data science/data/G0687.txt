<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> The main text illustrates that objects will get larger and brighter as we
look toward the antipode of a hypersphere, but just exactly <em>how much
larger</em> and <em>how much brighter</em>?   How do we attach specific numbers
to the theoretical phenomenon we just derived? 
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Two simple thought experiments give the answer. </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Suppose we were at the north pole and there was a cloud of a certain
angular size at the equator. &nbsp; If we moved it to 45&ordm; south latitude,
the cloud is 3/2 farther away and we would expect to be 2/3rds as large at
the further distance (provided we mistakenly assume we're on a flat surface). 
</p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> But the surface is actually <em>curved</em><strong>...</strong> </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Our lines of sight continue to <em>diverge</em> only until they reach
the equator, and then start to <em>converge</em> in a way that objects further
into the southern hemisphere actually seem to become larger. </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Let's consider &theta ("theta") to be the angle
of latitude south of the equator.   The cloud's apparent size is given by
1/cos &theta where &theta = 45&ordm;.
  Since cos 45&ordm; = 0.707, then 1/0.707 = 1.414.   So rather than appear
2/3rds of its angular size at this farther distance, instead it appears 1.414
times larger on this surface.   And the closer we move it to the south pole,
the larger it becomes (by 1/cos &theta), and doesn't
start to appear smaller until we move it beyond the south pole. </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Of course, <a href="App2.html">Appendix 2</a> indicates that whatever
happens in S<sup>2</sup> (this spherical surface) also happens at right angles
to S<sup>2</sup>, in S<sup>3</sup> hyperspace. &nbsp; We've determined the
<em>width</em> of the cloud, and this previously derived topological relationship
indicates that its <em>height</em> increases in the same manner. &nbsp; So
the cloud's total size -that is, its total perceived angular area (width
times height) - increases by 1/(cos &theta)<sup>2</sup>
. </p>
<p> 
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>   Next let's repeat the same experiment using a flashlight on the same
surface at the same relative positions.    We're at the North Pole and there
is a flashlight <em>at the equator</em> aimed directly at us.   The flashlight
appears to have a certain brightness or luminosity.   Whatever that luminosity
is, how would it <em>change</em> - that is, how much <em>brighter</em> would
it become - from our perspective as we moved it to 45&ordm; south latitude? 
</p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Remember that the brightness of the flashlight depends <em>inversely</em>
 on the relative width of the beam when it reaches us at the North Pole.
&nbsp; The width of the beam is determined by the same simple trigonometric
function, cos &theta used above where &theta is the distance in degrees from the equator to the south pole. </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Next, assuming we transpose this experiment on the spherical surface
to a hypothetical hypersphere, we also know that whatever happens <em>on</em>
 this spherical surface also happens <em>at right angles</em> to the surface.
  We take care of the "at right angles" aspect by squaring cosine &theta and the <em>inverse</em> characteristic of the beam is handled
by modifying this to 1/(cos &theta)<sup>2</sup> (Again,
the squaring of the term is derived from the analysis in <a href="App2.html">
Appendix 2</a>). </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Again, since cos 45&ordm; = .707, then 1/(.707)<sup>2</sup> = 2 and the
flashlight would appear twice as bright at 45&ordm; south latitude as it
would at the equator. </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> If we move the flashlight still further to 60&ordm; south latitude, then
cos 60&ordm; = .5.   After we do the number crunching (1/0.5<sup>2</sup>)
we find that that the flashlight appears four times brighter at this further
distance. </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> In general, astronomers usually don't deal in luminosity directly.  
Instead they convert the luminosity to magnitude, because magnitude is a
more manageable number based on logarithms.   There is a 2.512 change in
luminosity from one magnitude to the next, and so a two magnitude change
is 2.512<sup>2</sup>. <a name="table">    </a> </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> The following simple table shows you how much larger and how much brighter
objects become as we move them them into the southern hemisphere toward the
south pole (or the <strong>antipode</strong> of a hypersphere), compared to their size and
luminosity at the equator.   The increase in luminosity is converted into
to the corresponding increase in magnitude.
<p>
An increase in luminosity
can be expressed as 2.512<sup>x</sup>, and so the table tells you what that
"x" is, using the magnitude convention, and tells you how much the change 
in magnitude is.   (And &Delta below is a measure of that change.)  </p>

[I'm going to favor the Internet Explorer browser here, because it keeps the column headings in reasonable alignment.   The Greek letters - theta and delta - take up just one space on both browsers.   If I used the Netscape convention, they would take up one space on Netscape, but several spaces - the spelling fo the letter, plus & - on Internet Exploreer.   The triangle - capital delta - is the mathematical symbol for a noticeable change in the parameter under consideration.   It should show up as "D" on the Netscape browser.   Again, I recommend you refer to <A HREF="App11.html#table">Appendix 11</A> if you don't know what the problems are with each browser on the HTML coding for the Greek letters.]

<blockquote><font color="red">[There are two implicit assumptions in the above table regarding the red shift (z) column<strong>:</strong> (1) discrete objects pass through a <em>minimum</em> in luminosity and size at z = 1.0 (which corresponds to the "0&#186 equator") and (2) the "south pole at 90&#186" (or antipode in S<sup>3</sup>/V<sup>4</sup> space) has a red shift z of 3.5, at which distance objects will pass through a <em>maximum</em> in luminosity and size.   (Eventually you'll see why I picked this red shift.)   Then the approximate red shift in the right column is matched with the equivalent anomalous behavior in the columns to the left.
<p>
The table concentrates strictly on the trigonometric functions of the size and luminosity and ignores relativistic effects.   For example, time slows down at higher red shifts and, if we could see a luminous object at 85&#186; with a red shift of 3.2 <em>on our time scale</em>, it would appear about 0.6 magnitudes brighter than the 5.3 magnitude increase  shown on the table.  
<p>
Incidentally, the column showing the increase in luminosity could also double as the apparent increase in total size of the object, i.e., the length squared of the previous column.]
 </font>
 </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Sometimes I refer to the size increase as the "one over cosine theta"
effect and the luminosity increase as "one over cosine theta squared" effect.
  It attaches a specific number to an unusual effect caused by an antipode
which exists in Riemannian space. 
  <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> "One over cosine theta squared" is best used in the a fairly large
region of space where an antipode <em>might</em> be, but once we get very
close, it's just as easy to used the inverse square rule of luminosity, where
the radius is the distance measured from the antipode.   In fact, at angles
just short of 90&ordm;, "one over cosine theta squared" gives the same answer
as the inverse square rule (assuming the distance is reckoned from the antipode). 
  </p>
<A name="slope">  </a>
  <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> There is another way to express the principle mathematically.   In Euclidean space, the volume varies as the cube of the radius from a central location, while the luminosity of objects varies as the inverse square.   If we expressed these two numbers together, we would get 3/(-2) or simply -3/2.   So if we plotted luminosity by distance using a logarithmic scale, the slope of the line will be -3/2, which tells us mathematically that a uniform distribution of luminous objects in Euclidean space looks more numerous the farther out we look (by r<sup>3</sup>), but fainter (by r<sup>-2</sup>).
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> But suppose we can look toward an antipode in S<sup>3</sup> space.   How does this vary the standard -3/2 slope in Euclidean space?
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Everything is <em>reversed</em><strong>:</strong> as we look toward the antipode, objects will become brighter (by r<sup>2</sup>, with r measured from the antipode)  but fewer (by r<sup>3</sup>, with r  measured from the antipode).   The -3/2 slope in Euclidean space eventually becomes 2/3 in S<sup>3</sup> hyperspace if we manage to look toward an antipode.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Therefore, if we have a class of objects that are becoming fewer and brighter at the same time, it's a fair question to see how well they agree with the theoretical 2/3 slope and to wonder if space is still "Euclidean" in the region of the universe in which this happens.
<p> 
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> The most difficult piece of the cosmic jigsaw puzzle to fill in is just exactly where the "equator" is.   It's not where you think it is, if you use simple Euclidean geometry.   The cosmic "equator" is effectively
where objects are passing through a minimum in size and luminosity -  always
farther than the geometric equator - and the increase in size and luminosity
should be calculated from <em>that</em> position to the antipode.   <A HREF="App4.html#ein">In Appendix 4</A> this position is what Einstein referred to as "the maximum value of the 'world radius'."
<blockquote>
<font color=red>
[You'll get a link soon enough to a site that tells you where objects are passing
through a minimum, but for convenience I'll give it right now:<a href="App9.html#minimum">
Appendix 9</a>.   The middle section of this short file is what you want.]
</font
</blockquote>
</blockquote> 
<p>
  <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>   So any time you see a reference to an unusually luminous object in
deep space that seems several magnitudes brighter than it ought to be, it's
a fair question to ask is whether it's an effect caused by "one over cosine
theta squared" (which is an indirect way of asking if the increase in luminosity
is caused by its proximity to an unsuspected antipode). </p>
  <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> And, if you are a little patient, you will soon see that a variety
of objects in deep space seem inexplicably bright, including the quasar
population at high red shifts.
