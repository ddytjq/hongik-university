Our eyes are detectors which are designed to detect visible light waves 
(or visible radiation).     
Visible light is one of the few types of radiation that can
penetrate our atmosphere and be detected on the Earth's surface.             
As we have seen from the section on <a href="discovery.html">the discovery
of infrared</a>, there are forms of light (or radiation) which we cannot see.
Actually we can only see a very small part of the entire range of radiation
called the 
<a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/emspectrum.html">electromagnetic spectrum </a>.

The electromagnetic spectrum includes
gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet, visible, infrared, microwaves, and radio waves.
The only difference between these different types of radiation is their 
wavelength or frequency.  Wavelength increases and frequency (as well as 
energy and temperature) decreases
from gamma rays to radio waves.  All of these forms of radiation travel at  
the speed of light (186,000 miles or 300,000,000 meters per second in a vacuum).
In addition to visible light, radio, some infrared and a very small amount of
ultraviolet radiation also reaches the Earth's surface from space.
Fortunately for us, our atmosphere blocks out the rest, much of which is
very hazardous if not deadly for life on Earth.

Infrared radiation lies between the visible and microwave portions of the
electromagnetic spectrum.  Thus infrared waves
have wavelengths longer than visible and shorter than microwaves and
have frequencies which are lower than visible and higher than microwaves.
Near infrared refers to the part of the infrared spectrum that is closest
to visible light and far infrared refers to the part that is closer to 
the microwave region.

The primary source of infrared radiation is heat or thermal radiation.
Any object which has a temperature i.e. anything above absolute zero
(-459.67 degrees Fahrenheit or -273.15 degrees Celsius or 0 degrees Kelvin),
radiates in the infrared.  Even objects that
we think of as being very cold, such as an ice cube, emit infrared.
When an object is not quite hot enough to radiate visible light, it will emit
most of its energy in the infrared.
For example, hot charcoal may not give off light but it does emit infrared
radiation which we feel as heat.
The warmer the object, the more infrared radiation it emits.
The infrared image of a landing space shuttle shows
the how the tiles underneath the shuttle have been heated during re-entry.

Humans, at normal body temperature, radiate most strongly in the infrared at a
wavelength of about 10 microns (A micron is the term commonly used in 
astronomy for a micrometer or one millionth of a meter).
The image to the right shows a cat in the
infrared.  The yellow-white areas are the warmest and the purple areas are the
coldest.  This image gives us a different view of a familiar animal as well
as information that we could not get from a visible light picture.  Notice
the cold nose and the heat from the cat's eyes and ears.

Some animals can "see" in the infrared.  For example,
snakes in the pit viper family (e.g. rattlesnakes) have sensory "pits," which
are used to image infrared light.  This allows the snake to detect warm blooded
animals (even in dark burrows) by imaging the infrared heat that they radiate.
Snakes with 2 sensory
pits are thought to have some depth perception in the infrared.
<p>
We experience infrared radiation every day.                
The heat that we feel from sunlight, a fire, a radiator or a warm sidewalk is
infrared.  Although our eyes cannot see it, the nerves in our skin can feel
it as heat.  The temperature-sensitive nerve endings in your skin
can detect the difference between your inside body temperature and your 
outside skin temperature. 
We also commonly use infrared rays when we operate a television remote.
To learn more about the everyday applications of infrared imaging see our module
called <a href="http://sirtf.caltech.edu/Education/IRapp/benefits.html">
"Seeing Our World in a Different Light"</a>.  
We also have two new sites:       
<a href="http://sirtf.caltech.edu/Education/Yellowstone/gallery.html">
"Infrared Yellowstone"</a>, which provides an infrared view of the geysers, 
hot springs and mudpots of Yellowstone National Park, and 
<a href="http://sirtf.caltech.edu/Education/Zoo/zoo.html">The Infrared Zoo</a>,
which is a wonderful infrared gallery of animals.
