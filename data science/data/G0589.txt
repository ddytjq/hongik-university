<P>The <A HREF="http://www.astr.ua.edu/">Astronomy Group</A> within the
<A HREF="http://www.as.ua.edu/physics/">Department of Physics and Astronomy</A>
holds monthly Public Nights. All are welcome to come view the sky through
our facilities, on campus and off. Most sessions use the 
<A HREF="genetele.html">10&quot; refracting telescope</A> in the dome
on top of Gallalee Hall, located at the northeast corner of 
University Blvd. and Hackberry Drive. Our deep-sky observing sessions
use the 16" and (recently donated) 17" telescopes located in 
<a href="http://shpa.ua.edu/academic/museums/moundville/home.html">
Moundville Archaeological Park</a>. The telescope is set up on
a pad in the field across the road from the museum
(<a href="keel/ay101/moundmap.gif">see locator map</a>), so parking is
available at the museum and near the conference center overlooking
the Black Warrior River. (The park does not charge for after-hours admission
for these programs).</p>

Below are the dates for the currently scheduled Public
Nights, the starting times for the programs, and the speakers.
Note that several of these depart from Friday nights, to
accomodate special events. </P>

<H1>Coming Events </H1>

<P><!H1><BR>

<p> 
<b>Mars</b> is still high in the western sky after sunset, as the Earth pulls
ahead of it after a close look during last summer's opposition.
<b>Saturn</b> and <b>Jupiter</b> are bright through the spring, adorning what is
already the part of the sky richest in bright stars.
<b>Venus</b> is a morning object until February, after
which it slowly pulls into the evening sky through October.
Early May (10-13) offers the unusual chance to see all five naked-eye
planets, plus the Moon, in a small 33-degree span of evening sky.</p>

<p>A <b>partial solar eclipse</b> will occur shortly before sunset on 
June 10. From western Alabama, the Moon will first appear 
against the edge of the Sun about 7:22 p.m., eventually
covering 38% of the Sun's diameter. Sunset at 8:00 p.m.
will occur before the eclipse ends (or more carefully phrased,
there is an eclipse by the Earth which supercedes the one by the Moon).
A <b>penumbral lunar eclipse</b>, deep enough to be visually noticeable, happens
in the early evening of November 19, from 5:32-10:01 p.m. The
Moon rises during the eclipse. This is only 12 hours to late to
improve our view of the Leonid meteors.
More information on these eclipses (and others, past and future)
may be found at <a href="http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/eclipse.html">
Fred Espenak's eclipse site at NASA Goddard</a></p>

<p> <a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/odyssey/"> Mars Odyssey 2001</a>
continues aerobraking to refine its orbit after arrival last
October, preparing to look more directly for water near the surface
than possible before.
It joins the highly successful
<a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/index.html">Mars Global Surveyor</a>.
Meanwhile, the <a href="http://galileo.jpl.nasa.gov/">Galileo</a> orbiter
continues its extended mission to understand Jupiter and its moons.
This spacecraft will be deliberately destroyed in a high-speed entry
into Jupiter's atmosphere, to avoid the possibility of contaminating
one of its moons (on the chance that there might be microbial life
in subsurface oceans on one). And farther out,
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/">
Cassini</a>  continues its long climb toward a 2004 entry into orbit
around Saturn.</p>

<p> The Leonid meteors keep us guessing, rolling around in the
predawn hours of November
19. The 2001 shower delivered a very
<a href="keel/stargaze">impressive display</a>. The 2002 shower
is also predicted to be very strong, but the full Moon will
interfere (and mean that you get nearly the same show from
city and countryside, needing mostly a clear view of the sky).
Detailed predictions can be found from
<a href="http://star.arm.ac.uk/leonid/encounters.html">Armagh
Observatory</a>.
Current predictions are for this to be our last good shot at a
Leonid storm in most of our lifetimes.</p>

<h1> More Skywatching Information</h1>

<p> A useful listing of upcoming celestial events is sponsored by
<a href="http://www.skypub.com/sights/sights.shtml"> 
Sky and Telescope magazine</a>. For predicted visibility of satellites
from Tuscaloosa (or anywhere else you care to set), see the
<a href="http://www.heavens-above.com/main.asp?lat=33.21&lng=-87.54&loc=Tuscaloosa&TZ=CST"> 
Heavens-Above site</a>. The German Space Operations Center also has a
nice 
<a href="http://www2.gsoc.dlr.de/scripts/satvis/skyview.asp?lat=33.21&lng=-87.54&loc=Tuscaloosa&TZ=CST">
sky map Java applet</a>. The current 
<a href="http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/vphase.html"> phase of the
Moon</a> is available from the US Naval Observatory, along with
<a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/AA/"> positions of the planets</a>.
The USNO site also provides data on sun- and moonrise and set times.
