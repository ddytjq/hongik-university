<b>Comparing DNA Sequences</b>
<p><i>This procedure was recently written up by a gentleman who goes by
the name of Sumac on the several evolution discussion boards where he originally
posted this material. He has given me permission to reproduce his post.
This process will allow you to demonstrate that the vast majority (all?)
of DNA that has been sequenced in both humans and chimpanzees are the same
at 96% - 100% of the nucleotide sites.</i>
<ul>Go to <a href="http://www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/">NCBI Entrez</a>
and select <a href="http://www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/nucleotide.html">Nucleotide
Sequence Search</a>. Type chimpanzee in the search field box and click
'search'. Your search should retrieve at least 161,640 sequences [as of
July 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2002] . To view any sequence, simply click on the
linked accession number.
<p>Pick a sequence at random and open the page to view the sequence and
accompanying information. Select and copy the DNA sequence (typically,
<br>the DNA sequence is at the bottom of the page). At this point, you
can paste the sequence into a word processor program to remove spaces and
<br>digits or go directly to the next step; BLAST should ignore the spaces
and digits, but I don't know if it always does.
<p>Go to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/">NCBI BLAST</a> and
choose <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&LAYOUT=TwoWindows&AUTO_FORMAT=Semiauto&ALIGNMENTS=50&ALIGNMENT_VIEW=Pairwise&CLIENT=web&DATABASE=nr&DESCRIPTIONS=100&ENTREZ_QUERY=(none)&EXPECT=10&FILTER=L&FORMAT_OBJECT=Alignment&FORMAT_TYPE=HTML&HITLIST_SIZE=100&NCBI_GI=on&PAGE=Nucleotides&PROGRAM=blastn&SERVICE=plain&SET_DEFAULTS.x=34&SET_DEFAULTS.y=8&SHOW_OVERVIEW=on&END_OF_HTTPGET=Yes&SHOW_LINKOUT=yes">Basic
BLAST</a>. BLAST is a program that searches the databases for similar sequences.
Paste the copied sequence into the search field box. The default settings
(blastn, non-redundant database, FASTA format, etc.) are sufficient for
this demonstration Click the 'search' button.
<p>The next page you get will give you a request ID number for your search.
Click the 'format results' button. A new window will open with your search
results
<p>You should now have a page that contains a graphical representation
of the search, a list of hits in order of similarity, and a sequence alignment
for each hit. The first sequence in the hit list should be the original
chimpanzee sequence. The first non-chimpanzee sequence will be human. Scroll
down the page (or click the linked score to the right of the gene name)
and look at the alignment for that sequence.&nbsp; The sequence identity
will be somewhere between 96% and 100%. If you do a few of these searches
and average out the similarities, you will find that the average identity
between chimp and human will be very close to 98%.
