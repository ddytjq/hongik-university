The topic of computational gene recognition has become more and more
important as long DNA being sequenced in the Human Genome Project.
How do we know where the genes are located from the sequence information
alone? The papers listed in this 
bibliography are an accumulation of more than 15 years
of research in computational molecular biology on this topic.

To have an overall picture of how this task could possibly be accomplished, 
let's ask the following questions:

<p>
<p>
<img src="/wli/pic/wball.gif">
Where the genes are unlikely to be located? - 
<b>excluding inter-genic regions</b>.
<p>
<img src="/wli/pic/wball.gif">
How do transcription factors know where to bind a region
of DNA? - 
<b>searching  consensus patterns in the promoter  region</b>
<img src="/wli/pic/promoter_icon.gif">
<p>
<img src="/wli/pic/wball.gif">
Where are the transcription, splicing, and translation
start and stop signals? - <b> searching the start codon, 
the stop codons, and the  splicing sites</b> 
<img src="/wli/pic/splice_icon.gif">
<img src="/wli/pic/tl_icon.gif">
Be careful, though, with the non-universal genetic code
(see <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Taxonomy/wprintgc?mode=c"> 
a list here</a>)
<p>
<img src="/wli/pic/wball.gif">
What does coding region do (and non-coding regions do not) ? 
[Hint: It translates three nucleotides
to one amino acid!] - 
<b>recognizing the period-three pattern in coding region</b>
<p>
<img src="/wli/pic/wball.gif">
Can we learn from examples? These learned knowledges are
usually species-dependent (non-universal)
- <b> checking whether the codon usage in your sequence 
is closer to that in coding or non-coding sequences</b>
<p>
<img src="/wli/pic/wball.gif">
Does this sequence look familiar? I have seen this gene before
somewhere...  (yeah, right :-)) - <b>database similarity search</b>.
<img src="/wli/pic/similar_icon.gif">
Papers on database itself are labeled by <img src="/wli/pic/db_icon.gif">. 
This web page, <a href="http://130.132.229.55/gdp/gdp.html">
http://130.132.229.55/gdp/gdp.html </a>, provides ste-by-step procedures
for this approach.

Well, it pretty much summarizes methods used in computational
gene recognition! 
</font>
<p>
But, there are challenges! (added on October 11,1999)
<br>
<ul>
<p><li> The first and the last exon may contain untranslated
regions (so-called 5' UTR and 3' UTR, or UTS where S stands
for sequence) and the coding signal there can be very weak.

<p><li> Small exons are harder to predict.

<p><li> Since alternative splicing in human genome is not
uncommon, we face the problem of non-unique solution of
gene recognition!

</ul>
