        NONE of the Manchester United stars recognised their new teammate as he 
        joined them for the official photograph before their European Cup match 
        in Germany. 
        <p>Security chiefs at Bayern Munich’s stadium did not find it strange 
          that United were parading an extra man. 
        <p>Karl Power, 33, penniless and out of work, stood beaming in the full 
          strip alongside Andrew Cole, a £35,000-a-week England striker, in front 
          of a worldwide television audience of millions. For several embarrassing 
          minutes Mr Power, who describes himself as an odd-job man, posed alongside 
          United’s millionaires. He puffed out his chest, chatted to Ryan Giggs 
          and cheekily stepped in front of other household names to make sure 
          that he was seen. 
        <p>It was the captain, Roy Keane, who eventually noticed the interloper 
          and glowered at the overweight figure who bore a passing resemblance 
          to the former United hero Eric Cantona. Keane shouted to Gary Neville, 
          who pointed to a couple of team-mates, but by then Cole had helpfully 
          shuffled along to let the hoaxer into the picture. 
        <p>Yesterday Patrick Harveson, a United spokesman, said they had no idea 
          how Mr Power had managed his stunt but thought that it was “quite funny”. 
          Europe’s football chiefs were not so amused and ordered an investigation. 
        <p>Responsibility for the stunt was claimed by the magazine <i>Front</i>, 
          whose editor, Piers Hernu, said: “It was meant to amuse, not disrupt 
          the game in any way”. The magazine is investigating how fans such as 
          Mr Power can travel the world watching their team for virtually nothing. 
          Mr Power, an avid United supporter who lives in the Manchester suburb 
          of Droylsden, admits that he rarely misses a match in Europe but is 
          coy about how he does it. 
        <p>Last night he told how his plan was nearly rumbled by Gary Neville. 
          He told <i>The Sun:</i> “As I ran on to the pitch, Gary tried to grass 
          me up. He knew exactly what was going on and started waving his finger 
          at me and telling me to get the hell out of it. But I just opened my 
          mouth and yelled, ‘I’m doing this for Eric Cantona — now shut it.’ I 
          was as surprised as anyone when he did.” 
        <p>He feared that the glowering Roy Keane would have “taken it a step 
          further than Gary” but a knowing smile from Dwight Yorke gave Mr Power 
          the confidence to see the prank through.The stunt had been planned over 
          three weeks as if it were a “military campaign”. Mr Power discovered 
          the correct coloured United kit from an indiscreet club director and 
          slipped past the gatemen by pretending to be part of a television crew. 
        <p>He made his dash to the pitchside after spotting an entrance that was 
          unattended by stewards. He sat with a group of photographers during 
          the warm-up and followed his heroes when they ran out of the players’ 
          entrance. After his moment of glory he ran off to rejoin the surprised 
          photographers.
