Known pre-historically. Mentioned by Hesiod between 1000 and 700 B.C.
<p>
The Pleiades are among those objects which are known since the earliest 
times. At least 6 member stars are visible to the naked eye, while under 
moderate conditions this number increases to 9, and under clear dark skies
jumps up to more than a dozen (Vehrenberg, in his <i>Atlas of Deep Sky 
Splendors</i>, mentions that in 1579, well before the invention of the 
telescope, astronomer Moestlin has correctly drawn 11 Pleiades stars, 
while Kepler quotes observations of up to 14). 
<p>
Modern observing methods have revealed that at least about 500 mostly 
faint stars belong to the Pleiades star cluster, spread over a 2 degree 
(four times the diameter of the Moon) field. Their density is pretty low, 
compared to other open clusters. This is one reason why the life 
expectation of the Pleiades cluster is also pretty low (see below).
<p>
According to Kenneth Glyn Jones, the earliest known reference of this 
cluster is a mention by Hesiod, about 1000 BC (according to Burnham, 
they were seen in connection to the agricultural seasons of that time). 
Homer mentions them in his <i>Odyssee</i>, and the Bible has three 
references to the Pleiades. 
<p>
The Pleiades also carry the name "Seven Sisters"; according to Greek 
mythology, seven daughters and their parents. Their Japanese name is 
"Subaru", which was taken to christen the car of same name. The Persian 
name is "Soraya", after which the former Iranian empress was named.  
Old European (e.g., English and German) names indicate they were once 
compared to a  "Hen with Chicks". Other cultures tell 
<a href="../more/m045_lore.html">more and other lore</a> of this naked-eye 
star cluster. Ancient Greek astronomers Eudoxus of Knidos (c. 403-350 BC) 
and Aratos of Phainomena (c. 270 BC) listed them as an own constellation: 
<i>The Clusterers</i>. This is also referred to by Admiral Smyth in his 
<a href="../m-ref.html#smyth"><i>Bedford Catalog</i></a>.
<p>
Burnham points out that the name "Pleiades" may be derived
from either the Greek word for "to sail", or the word "pleios" meaning
"full" or "many".  The present author prefers the view that the name may be 
derived from the mythological mother, Pleione, which is also the name of one
of the brighter stars.
<p>
According to Greek mythology, the main, visible stars are named for the seven
daughters of "father" Atlas and "mother" Pleione:
Alcyone, Asterope (a double star), Electra, Maia, Merope, Taygeta and Celaeno.
<a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/">Bill Arnett</a> has created a 
<a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/twn/img/m45map.gif">map of the Pleiades</a> 
with the main star names. These stars are also labeled in 
<a href="../more/m045_tab.html#m45uks_t">a labeled copy of the UKS image</a>
which appears in this page.
Also note <a href="../more/m045_map.html">our Pleiades map</a>.
<p>
In 1767, Reverend John Michell used the Pleiades to calculate the probability
to find such a group of stars in any place in the sky by chance alignment, and 
found the chance to be about 1/496,000. Therefore, and because there are more 
similar clusters, he concluded correctly that clusters should be physical 
groups (<a href="#michell1767">Michell 1767</a>).
<p>
In 1771, Charles Messier included the Pleiades as 
<a href="../xtra/history/m-cat.html#M45">No. 45</a> in his first list of 
nebulae and star clusters.
<p>
About 1846, German astronomer M&auml;dler (1794-1874), working at Dorpat, 
noticed that the stars of the Pleiades had no measurable proper motion relative 
to each other; from this he boldly concluded that they form a motionless center
of a larger stellar system, with star Alcyone in the center. This conclusion 
was to be, and was, rejected by other astronomers, in particular Wilhelm Struve
(1793-1864). Nevertheless, the common proper motion of the Pleiades was a proof
that they move as a group in space, and a further hint that they form a 
physical cluster.
<p>
Longer exposure photographs (and also short focal ratio, i.e. short focal 
length compared to their aperture, "rich field" telescopes of considerably 
good quality, especially good binoculars) have revealed that the Pleiades 
are apparently imbedded in nebulous material, obvious in our image, which 
was taken by <i>David Malin</i> with the UK Schmidt Telescope, and is 
copyrighted by the Royal Observatory Edinburgh and the 
<a href="http://www.aao.gov.au/">Anglo-Australian Observatory</a>.
<a href="../more/m045_image.html">More information on this image</a> 
is available.
<p>
The Pleiades nebulae are blue-colored, which indicates that they are 
<i>reflection nebulae</i>, reflecting the light of the bright stars 
situated near (or within) them. The brightest of these nebulae, that 
around <a href="../more/m045_merope.html">Merope</a>, was discovered on 
October 19, 1859 by Ernst Wilhelm Leberecht (Wilhelm) Tempel at Venice 
(Italy) with a 4-inch refractor; it is included in the NGC as NGC 1435.
<a href="http://leo.astronomy.cz/">Leos Ondra</a> has made the 
<a href="../xtra/leos/tempel.html">biography of Wilhelm Tempel</a> 
available online together with a drawing of the Merope Nebula, and 
has agreed to include it in this database. 
The extension to Alcyone was discovered in 1875 (this is NGC 1432), the 
nebulae around Electra, Celaeno and Taygeta in 1880.
The full complexity of the Pleiades nebulae was revealed by the first 
astro cameras, e.g. by that of the brothers Henry in Paris and 
Isaac Roberts in England, between 1885 and 1888. 
In 1890, E.E. Barnard discovered a starlike concentration of nebulous 
matter very close to Merope, which found its way into the IC as 
<a href="../more/m045_i349.html">IC 349</a>.
The analysis of the spectra of the Pleiades nebulae by Vesto M. Slipher 
in 1912 reveiled their nature as reflection nebulae, as their spectra 
are exact copies of the spectra of the stars illuminating them.
<p>
More information can be found in our
<a href="../more/m045_tab.html">table of the main Pleiades stars</a> 
and the corresponding nebulosity with the catalog numbers.
<p>
Physically, the reflection nebula is probably part of the dust in a 
molecular cloud, unrelated to the Pleiades cluster, which happens to 
cross the cluster's way. It is <i>not</i> a remainder of the nebula from 
which the cluster once formed, as can be seen from the fact that the 
nebula and cluster have different radial velocities, crossing each other 
with a relative velocity of 6.8 mps, or 11 km/sec.
<p>
According to new calculations published by a team from Geneva,
G. Meynet, J.-C. Mermilliod, and A. Maeder in
<i>Astron. Astrophys. Suppl. Ser.</i> <b>98</b>, 477-504, 1993,
the age of the Pleiades star cluster amounts 100 million years.
This is considerably more than the previously published "canonical" age
of 60--80 million years (e.g., the Sky Catalog 2000's 78 million).
It has been calculated that the Pleiades have an expected future 
lifetime as a cluster of only about another 250 million years 
(Kenneth Glyn Jones); after that time, they will have been spread as 
individual (or multiple) stars along their orbital path.
<p>
The distance of the Pleiades cluster has been newly determined by direct 
parallax measures by ESA's astrometric satellite Hipparcos; according to
these measurement, the Pleiades are at a distance of 380 light years 
(previously, a value of 408 light years had been assumed). The new value
requires an explanation for the comparatively faint apparent magnitudes
of the Pleiades stars.
<p>
The Trumpler classification is given for the Pleiades as II,3,r (Trumpler, 
according to Kenneth Glyn Jones) or I,3,r,n (G&ouml;tz and Sky Catalog 2000),
meaning that this cluster appears detached and strong or moderately 
concentrated toward its center, its stars are spread in a large range of 
brightness, and it is rich (has more than 100 members).
<p>
Some of the Pleiades stars are rapidly rotating, at velocities of 150 to
300 km/sec at their surfaces, which is common among main sequence stars of 
a certain spectral type (A-B). Due to this rotation, they must be (oblate) 
spheroids rather than spherical bodies. The rotation can be detected 
because it leades to broadened and diffuse spectral absorption lines, 
as parts of the stellar surface approach us on the one side, while
those on the opposite side recede from us, relative to the star's mean 
radial velocity.
The most prominent example for a rapidly rotating star in this cluster is 
<a href="../more/pleione.html">Pleione</a>, which is also variable in 
brightness between mag 4.77 and 5.50 (Kenneth Glyn Jones).
It was spectroscopically observed that between the years 1938 and 1952,
Pleione has ejected a gas shell because of this rotation, as had been 
predicted by O. Struve.
<p>
Cecilia Payne-Gaposhkin mentions that the Pleiades contain some white dwarf 
(WD) stars. These stars give rise to a specific problem of stellar 
evolution:  How can white dwarfs exist in such a young star cluster ?  
As it is not only one, it is most certain that these stars are original 
cluster members and not all field stars which have been captured 
(a procedure which does not work effectively in the rather loose open 
clusters anyway). From the theory of stellar evolution, it follows that 
white dwarfs cannot have masses above a limit of about 1.4 solar masses 
(the Chandrasekhar limit), as they would collapse due to their own 
gravitation if they were more massive. But stars with such a low mass 
evolve so slow that it takes them billions of years to evolve into that 
final state, not only the 100 million year age of the Pleiades cluster.
<p>
The only possible explanation seems to be that these WD stars were once 
massive so that they evolved fast, but due to some reason (such as strong 
stellar winds,mass loss to close neighbors, or fast rotation) have lost the 
greastest part of their mass.  Possibly they have, in consequence, lost 
another considerable percentage of their mass in a planetary nebula.  
Anyway, the final remaining stars (which was previously the star's core) 
must have come below the Chandrasekhar limit, so that they could go into 
the stable white dwarf end state, in which they are now observed.
<p>
New observations of the Pleiades since 1995 have revealed several 
candidates of an exotic type of stars, or starlike bodies, the so-called 
Brown Dwarfs.  These hitherto hypothetical objects are thought to have a 
mass intermediate between that of giant planets (like Jupiter) and small 
stars (the theory of stellar structure indicates that the smallest stars, 
i.e. bodies that produce energy by fusion somewhen in their lifetime, must 
have at least about 6..7 percent of one solar mass, i.e. 60 to 70 Jupiter 
masses).  So brown dwarfs should have 10 to about 60 times the mass of 
Jupiter.  They are assumed to be visible in the infrared light, have a 
diameter of about or less that of Jupiter (143,000 km), and a density 10 
to 100 times that of Jupiter, as their much stronger gravity presses them 
tougher together.
<p>
As the Pleiades are situated close to the ecliptic (4 degrees off), 
occultations of the cluster by the Moon occur quite frequently: This is a 
very appealing spectacle, especially for amateurs with less expensive 
equipment (actually, you can observe it with the naked eye, but even the 
smallest binoculars or telescopes will increase observing pleasure -- the 
March 1972 Pleiad occultation was one of the first amateur astronomical 
experiences of the present author).  Such events demonstrate the relations 
of the apparent sizes of the Moon and the cluster: Burnham points out that 
the Moon may be "inserted into the quadrangle formed by" Alcyone, Electra, 
Merope and Taygeta (Maia, and possibly Asterope, is occulted in this 
situation).  Also, planets come close to the Pleiades cluster (Venus, Mars, 
and Mercury even occasionally pass through) to give a conspicuous 
spectacle.
<p>
As mentioned in the description for the 
<a href="m042.html">Orion Nebula M42</a>, it is a bit unusual that Messier 
added the Pleiades 
(together with the Orion Nebula M42/<a href="m043.html">M43</a> and the 
<a href="m044.html">Praesepe cluster M44</a>) to his catalog, and will 
perhaps <a href="../m-q&a.html#why_M42-45">stay subject to speculation</a>.
