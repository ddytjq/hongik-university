      <P>It's a bit of hyperbole that illustrates a point: The Crab
      Nebula seems to have most of what's in the celestial bestiary.
      It is one of the most spectacular nebulas in the sky. It's a
      supernova remnant. It has a pulsar that emits in radio, visible,
      ultraviolet, and X-ray wavelengths. It even has a well-established
      pedigree since it was sighted by royal Chinese astronomers when
      light from the supernova arrived here in 1054.</P>

      <P>&quot;The Crab Nebula and the star at the center of it are
      the Rosetta Stone of modern astrophysics,&quot; said Dr. Martin
      Weisskopf, Project Scientist for the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
      The Rosetta Stone is a block of black granite (discovered in
      1799) inscribed in Greek, Demotic, and Egyptian hieroglyphs.
      From this, archaeologists were able to start decoding the texts
      of ancient Egypt.</P>

      often are faced with the challenge of estimating the age of an
      artifact such as a supernova remnant. Calculations can yield

      Nebula has a provenance, starting with records kept by royal

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Crab appeared in July or
      August A.D. 1054, according to Chinese records, probably on July
      5, according to Native American cave drawings White Mesa and
      Navajo Canyon. Appearing in the sky above the southern horn of
      the constellation Taurus was a star the Chinese described as
      six times brighter than Venus, about as brilliant as the full
      Moon - and visible during the day for almost a month, and at
      night for a year.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Small wonder. At its peak it
      blazed with the light of about 400 million suns. That was enough
      energy to have destroyed all living things on any planet within
      50 light years. Fortunately for us, the Crab is more than 7,000
      light years away, so the pulse Earth received was about 1/20,000th
      what it would have been for a closer world.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Then it faded from view and memory
      until 1731 when English physicist and amateur astronomer John
      Bevis observed the strings of gas and dust that form the nebula.
      While hunting for comets in 1758, Charles Messier spotted the
      nebula, spotted it as he started his list of objects that are
      not comets, his real quarry. The nebula became M1 in his famous
      &quot;Catalogue of Nebulae and Star Clusters,&quot; published
      in 1774. Lord Rosse named the nebula the &quot;Crab&quot; in
      1844 because its tentacle-like structure resembled the legs of
      the crustacean.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In the decades following Lord
      Rosse's work, astronomers continued to study the Crab because
      of their fascination for the strange object. In 1939, astronomer
      John Duncan concluded that the nebula was expanding and probably
      originated from a point source about 766 years earlier (he was
      only off by a century, a remarkably accurate estimate). Historians
      later linked the Crab with the &quot;guest star&quot; of 1054.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Walter Baade probed deeper into
      the nebula, observing in 1942 that a prominent star near the
      nebula's center might be related to its origin. Six years later,
      scientists discovered that the Crab was emitting among the strongest
      radio waves of any celestial object. Baade noticed in 1954 that
      the Crab possessed powerful magnetic fields, and in 1963, a high-altitude
      rocket detected X-ray energy from the nebula.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Radio waves. X-rays. Strong magnetic
      fields. Scientists knew that the Crab Nebula was a powerful source
      of radiation, but what was its power source? They discovered
      it in 1968: an object in the nebula's center - Baade's prominent
      star - that emitted bursts of radio waves 30 times per second.</FONT>
      <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Scientists soon concluded that the
      pulsar was a neutron star because theory suggested that these
      stars existed at the centers of supernova remnants.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Crab Pulsar acts as a celestial
      power station, generating enough energy to keep the entire nebula
      radiating over almost the whole electromagnetic spectrum. Because
      of the pulsar's power, the nebula shines brighter than 75,000
      suns. That's bright enough to draw the constant attention of
      astrophysicists from across the planet and the spectrum.</FONT>

    <!--/NOEDIT-->In like manner, the Crab Nebula has features
      serve as clues to the inner workings of a range of astrophysical
      phenomena. In the last couple of weeks, Chandra and its remarkable
      X-ray telescope targeted the Crab Nebula to collect more clues
      with the High Resolution Camera. Those images are to be released
      today in a Space Science Update at NASA headquarters.</P>

      <P>&quot;Right now [before Chandra] we're looking at the glow
      of activity near the center of the nebula as you might see the
      glow of city lights from a distance,&quot; Weisskopf said in
      a 1998 interview. &quot;Examining the pulsar in the center using
      Chandra will be like using a telescope to focus on a single street
      light in the middle of the city.&quot;</P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The Hubble team found that material
      doesn't move away from the pulsar in all directions, but instead
      is concentrated into two polar &quot;jets&quot; and a wind moving
      out from the star's equator. The most dynamical feature is the
      point where one of the polar jets runs into the surrounding material
      forming a shock front. The shape and position of this feature
      shifts about so rapidly that the astronomers describe it as a
      &quot;dancing sprite,&quot; or &quot;a cat on a hot plate.&quot;
      The equatorial wind appears as a series of wisp-like features
      that steepen, brightenand then fade as they move away from the
      pulsar to well out into the main body of the nebula.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&quot;Watching the wisps move
      outward through the nebula is a lot like watching waves crashing
      on the beach - except that in the Crab the waves are a light-year
      long and are moving through space at half the speed of light,&quot;
      said Hester. &quot;You don't learn about ocean waves by staring
      at a snapshot. By their nature waves on the ocean are ever changing.
      You learn about ocean waves by sitting on the beach and watching
      as they roll ashore. This Hubble 'movie' of the Crab is so significant
      because for the first time we are watching as these 'waves' from
      the Crab come rolling in.&quot;</FONT>

      mass greater than our Sun, and a density equivalent to cramming
      a World War II battleship into the head of a pin.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The star's gravitational field
      is about 300,000 times stronger than the Earth's. Its rotation
      also increases dramatically during the collapse, like a skater

      a neutron star and a pulsar is that a pulsar has a magnetic field

      an angle of about 30 degrees to the rotation poles.</FONT></P>

      years for the pulsar to slow to half its current rotation speed.
      The Crab's pulses will weaken, and its X-ray emissions eventually
