<p><img src="/pictures/letters/C.gif" alt="C"
align="left" width="38" height="47" />reationist models are 
often criticized for
being too vague to have any predictive value. A literal
interpretation of the Flood story in Genesis, however, does
imply certain physical consequences which can be tested
against what we actually observe, and the implications of
such an interpretation are investigated below. Some
creationists provided even more detailed models, and these
are also addressed (see especially sections 5 and 7).</p>

<p>References are listed at the end of each section.</p>

<p>Two kinds of flood model are <strong>not</strong>
addressed here. First is the local flood. Genesis 6-8 can
be interpreted as a homiletic story such that the "world"
that was flooded was just the area that Noah knew.
Creationists argue against the local flood model because it
doesn't fit their own literalist preconceptions, but I know
of no physical evidence contrary to such a model.</p>

<p>Second, the whole story can be dismissed as a series of
supernatural miracles. There is no way to contradict such
an argument. However, one must wonder about a God who
reportedly does one thing and then arranges every bit of
evidence to make it look like something else happened. It's
entirely possible that a global flood occurred 4000 years
ago or even last Thursday, and that God subsequently erased
all the evidence, including our memories of it. But even if
such stories are true, what's the point?</p>

<h2><a name="building"></a>1. Building the Ark</h2>

<p>Wood is not the best material for shipbuilding. It is
not enough that a ship be built to hold together; it must
also be sturdy enough that the changing stresses don't open
gaps in its hull. Wood is simply not strong enough to
prevent separation between the joints, especially in the
heavy seas that the Ark would have encountered. The longest
wooden ships in modern seas are about 300 feet, and these
require reinforcing with iron straps and leak so badly they
must be constantly pumped. The ark was 450 feet long 
[<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=gen+6:15">
Gen. 6:15</a>]. 
Could an ark that size be made seaworthy?</p>

<h2><a name="gathering"></a>2. Gathering the Animals</h2>

<p>Bringing all kinds of animals together in the vicinity
of the ark presents significant problems.</p>

<p><b>Could animals have traveled from elsewhere?</b> If
the animals traveled from other parts of the world, many of
them would have faced extreme difficulties.</p>

<ul>
<li>Some, like sloths and penguins, can't travel overland
very well at all.</li>

<li>Some, like koalas and many insects, require a special
diet. How did they bring it along?</li>

<li>Some cave-dwelling arthropods can't survive in less
than 100% relative humidity.</li>

<li>Some, like dodos, must have lived on islands. If they
didn't, they would have been easy prey for other animals.
When mainland species like rats or pigs are introduced to
islands, they drive many indigenous species to extinction.
Those species would not have been able to survive such
competition if they lived where mainland species could get
at them before the Flood.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Could animals have all lived near Noah?</b> Some
creationists suggest that the animals need not have
traveled far to reach the Ark; a moderate climate could
have made it possible for all of them to live nearby all
along. However, this proposal makes matters even worse. The
last point above would have applied not only to island
species, but to almost all species. Competition between
species would have driven most of them to extinction.</p>

<p>There is a reason why Gila monsters, yaks, and quetzals
don't all live together in a temperate climate. They can't
survive there, at least not for long without special care.
Organisms have preferred environments outside of which they
are at a deadly disadvantage. Most extinctions are caused
by destroying the organisms' preferred environments. The
creationists who propose all the species living together in
a uniform climate are effectively proposing the destruction
of all environments but one. Not many species could have
survived that.</p>

<p><b>How was the Ark loaded?</b> Getting all the animals
aboard the Ark presents logistical problems which, while
not impossible, are highly impractical. Noah had only seven
days to load the Ark 
(<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=gen+7:4-10">
Gen. 7:4-10</a>). If only 15764 animals
were aboard the Ark (see section 3), one animal must have
been loaded every 38 seconds, without letup. Since there
were likely more animals to load, the time pressures would
have been even worse.</p>

<h2><a name="fitting"></a>3. Fitting the Animals Aboard</h2>

<p>To determine how much space is required for animals, we
must first determine what is a kind, how many kinds were
aboard the ark, and how big they were.</p>

<p><b>What is a kind?</b> Creationists themselves can't
decide on an answer to this question; they propose criteria
ranging from species to order, and I have even seen an
entire kingdom (bacteria) suggested as a single kind.
Woodmorappe (p. 5-7) compromises by using genus as a kind.
However, on the ark "kind" must have meant something closer
to species for three reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>For purposes of naming animals, the people who live
among them distinguish between them (that is, give them
different names) at roughly the species level. 
[<a href="#r3Gould">Gould, 1980</a>]</li>

<li>The Biblical "kind," according to most interpretations,
implies reproductive separateness. On the ark, the purpose
of gathering different kinds was to preserve them by later
reproduction. Species, by definition, is the level at which
animals are reproductively distinct.</li>

<li>The Flood, according to models, was fairly recent.
There simply wouldn't have been time enough to accumulate
the number of mutations necessary for the diversity of
species we see within many genera today.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>What kinds were aboard the ark?</b> 
<a href="#r3Woodmorappe">Woodmorappe</a> and
<a href="#r3Whitcomb">Whitcomb &amp; Morris</a>
arbitrarily exclude all animals
except mammals, birds, and reptiles. However, many other
animals, particularly land arthropods, must also have been
on the ark for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Bible says so. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=gen+7:8">Gen. 7:8</a>
puts on the ark all
creatures that move along the ground, with no further
qualifications. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=lev+11:42">Lev. 11:42</a>
includes arthropods (creatures
that "walk on many feet") in such a category.</li>

<li>They couldn't survive outside. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=gen+7:21-23">Gen. 7:21-23</a> 
says every
land creature not aboard the ark perished. And indeed, not
one insect species in a thousand could survive for half a
year on the vegetation mats proposed by some creationists.
Most other land arthropods, snails, slugs, earthworms, etc.
would also have to be on the ark to survive.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Were dinosaurs and other extinct animals on the
ark?</b> According to the Bible, Noah took samples of all
animals alive at the time of the Flood. If, as creationists
claim, all fossil-bearing strata were deposited by the
Flood, then all the animals which became fossils were alive
then. Therefore all extinct land animals had
representatives aboard the ark.</p>

<p>It is also worth pointing out that the number of extinct
species is undoubtedly greater than the number of known
extinct species. New genera of dinosaurs have been
discovered at a nearly constant rate for more than a
century, and there's no indication that the rate of
discovery will fall off in the near future.</p>

<p><b>Were the animals aboard the ark mature?</b>
Woodmorappe
gets his animals to fit only by taking juvenile
pairs of everything weighing more than 22 lbs. as an adult.
However, it is more likely that Noah would have brought
adults aboard:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Bible 
(<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=gen+7:2">Gen. 7:2</a>)
speaks of "the male and his mate,"
indicating that the animals were at sexual maturity.</li>

<li>Many animals require the care of adults to teach them
behaviors they need for survival. If brought aboard as
juveniles, these animals wouldn't have survived.</li>
</ul>

<p> The last point does not apply to all animals. However, the
animals don't need parental care tend to be animals that mature
quickly, and thus would be close to adult size after a year of
growth anyway. </p>


<p><b>How many clean animals were on the ark?</b> The Bible
says either seven or fourteen (it's ambiguous) of each kind
of clean animal was aboard. It defines clean animals
essentially as ruminants, a suborder which includes about
69 recent genera, 192 recent species 
[<a href="#r3Wilson">Wilson &amp; Reeder,
1993</a>], and probably a comparable number of extinct genera
and species. That is a small percentage of the total number
of species, but ruminants are among the largest mammals, so
their bulk is significant.</p>

<p><a href="#r3Woodmorappe">Woodmorappe</a> (p. 8-9) 
gets around the problem by citing
Jewish tradition which gives only 13 domestic genera as
clean. He then calculates that this would increase the
total animal mass by 2-3% and decides that this amount is
small enough that he can ignore it completely. However,
even Jewish sources admit that this contradicts the
unambiguous word of the Bible. 
[<a href="#r3Steinsaltz">Steinsaltz, 1976</a>, p. 187]</p>

<p>The number and size of clean birds is small enough to
disregard entirely, but the Bible at one point 
(<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=gen+7:3">Gen. 7:3</a>)
says seven of <i>all kinds</i> of birds were aboard.</p>

<p><b>So, could they all fit?</b> It is important to take
the size of animals into account when considering how much
space they would occupy because the greatest number of
species occurs in the smallest animals. 
Woodmorappe
performed such an analysis and came to the conclusion that
the animals would take up 47% of the ark. In addition, he
determines that about 10% of the ark was needed for food
(compacted to take as little space as possible) and 9.4%
for water (assuming no evaporation or wastage). At least
25% of the space would have been needed for corridors and
bracing. Thus, increasing the quantity of animals by more
than about 5% would overload the ark.</p>

<p>However, Woodmorappe makes several questionable and
invalid assumptions. Here's how the points discussed above
affect his analysis. Table 1 shows Woodmorappe's analysis
and some additional calculations.</p>

<a href="#r3Woodmorappe">Woodmorappe,

arithmetic errors in totals are corrected.) Woodmorappe
treats many animals as juveniles; "yearling" masses are
masses of those animals after one year of growth. "Total
mass after one year" is the maximum load which Woodmorappe
allows for. Additional clean animal figures assume they are
taken aboard by sevens, not seven pairs, and also assume
juvenile animals.</caption>

<ul>
<li>Collecting each species instead of each genus would
increase the number of individuals three- to fourfold. The
most speciose groups tend to be the smaller animals,
though, so the total mass would be approximately doubled or
tripled.</li>

<li>Collecting all land animals instead of just mammals,
birds, and reptiles would have insignificant impact on the
space required, since those animals, though plentiful, are
so small. (The problems come when you try to care for them
all.)</li>

<li>Leaving off the long-extinct animals would free
considerable space. Woodmorappe doesn't say how many of the
animals in his calculations are known only from fossils,
but it is apparently 50-70% of them, including most of the
large ones. However, since he took only juveniles of the
large animals, leaving off all the dinosaurs etc. would
probably not free more than 80% of the space. On the other
hand, collecting all extinct animals in addition to just
the known ones would increase the load by an unknown but
probably substantial amount.</li>

<li>Loading adults instead of juveniles as small as
Woodmorappe uses would increase the load 13- to
50-fold.</li>

<li>Including extra clean animals would increase the load
by 1.5-3% if only the 13 traditional domestic ruminants are
considered, but by 14-28% if all ruminants are considered
clean.</li>
</ul>

<p> In conclusion, an ark of the size specified in the Bible would
not be large enough to carry a cargo of animals and food sufficient
to repopulate the earth, especially if animals that are now extinct
were required to be aboard. </p>

<h2><a name="caring"></a>4. Caring for the Animals</h2>

<p><b>Special diets.</b> Many animals, especially insects,
require special diets. Koalas, for example, require
eucalyptus leaves, and silkworms eat nothing but mulberry
leaves. For thousands of plant species (perhaps even most
plants), there is at least one animal that eats only that
one kind of plant. How did Noah gather all those plants
aboard, and where did he put them?</p>

<p>Other animals are strict carnivores, and some of those
specialize on certain kinds of foods, such as small
mammals, insects, fish, or aquatic invertebrates. How did
Noah determine and provide for all those special diets?</p>

<p><b>Fresh foods.</b> Many animals require their food to
be fresh. Many snakes, for example, will eat only live
foods (or at least warm and moving). Parasitoid wasps only
attack living prey. Most spiders locate their prey by the
vibrations it produces. 
[<a href="#r4Foelix">Foelix, 1996</a>] Most herbivorous
insects require fresh food. Aphids, in fact, are physically
incapable of sucking from wilted leaves. How did Noah keep
all these food supplies fresh?</p>

<p><b>Food preservation/Pest control.</b> Food spoilage is
a major concern on long voyages; it was especially thus
before the inventions of canning and refrigeration. The
large quantities of food aboard would have invited
infestations of any of hundreds of stored product pests
(especially since all of those pests would have been
aboard), and the humidity one would expect aboard the Ark
would have provided an ideal environment for molds. How did
Noah keep pests from consuming most of the food?</p>

<p><b>Ventilation.</b> The ark would need to be well
ventilated to disperse the heat, humidity, and waste
products (including methane, carbon dioxide, and ammonia)
from the many thousands of animals which were crowded
aboard. 
<a href="#r4Woodmorappe">Woodmorappe</a>
(pp. 37-42) interprets 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=gen+6:16">Genesis 6:16</a>
to mean there was an 18-inch opening all around the top, and
says that this, with slight breezes, would have been enough
to provide adequate ventilation. However, the ark was
divided into separate rooms and decks 
(<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=gen+6:14,16">Gen. 6:14,16</a>). 
How was fresh air circulated throughout the structure?</p>

<p><b>Sanitation.</b> The ungulates alone would have
produced tons of manure a day. The waste on the lowest deck
at least (and possibly the middle deck) could not simply be
pushed overboard, since the deck was below the water line;
the waste would have to be carried up a deck or two.
Vermicomposting could reduce the rate of waste
accumulation, but it requires maintenance of its own. How
did such a small crew dispose of so much waste?</p>

<p><b>Exercise/Animal handling.</b> The animals aboard the
ark would have been in very poor shape unless they got
regular exercise. (Imagine if you had to stay in an area
the size of a closet for a year.) How were several thousand
diverse kinds of animals exercised regularly?</p>

<p><b>Manpower for feeding, watering, etc.</b> How did a
crew of eight manage a menagerie larger and more diverse
than that found in zoos requiring many times that many
employees? Woodmorappe claims that eight people could care
for 16000 animals, but he makes many unrealistic and
invalid assumptions. Here are a few things he didn't take
into account:</p>

<ul>
<li>Feeding the animals would take much longer if the food
was in containers to protect it from pests.</li>

<li>Many animals would have to be hand-fed.</li>

<li>Watering several animals at once via troughs would not
work aboard a ship. The water would be sloshed out by the
ship's roll.</li>

<li>Many animals, in such an artificial environment, would
have required additional special care. For example, all of
the hoofed animals would need to have their hooves trimmed
several times during the year. 
[<a href="#r4Batten">Batten, 1976</a>, pp.
39-42]</li>

<li>Not all manure could be simply pushed overboard; a
third of it at least would have to be carried up at least
one deck.</li>

<li>Corpses of the dead animals would have to be removed
regularly.</li>

<li>Animals can't be expected to run laps and return to
their cages without a lot of human supervision.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="flood"></a>5. The Flood Itself</h2>

<p> Where did the Flood water come from, and where did it go?
Several people have proposed answers to these questions, but none
which consider all the implications of their models. A few of the
commonly cited models are addressed below. </p>


<p><b>Vapor canopy.</b> This model, proposed by 
<a href="#r5Whitcomb">Whitcomb
&amp; Morris</a> and others, proposes that much of the Flood
water was suspended overhead until the 40 days of rain
which caused the Flood. The following objections are
covered in more detail by 
<a href="#r5Brown">Brown</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>How was the water suspended, and what caused it to fall
all at once when it did?</li>

<li>If a canopy holding the equivalent to more than 40 feet
of water were part of the atmosphere, it would raise the
atmospheric pressure accordingly, raising oxygen and
nitrogen levels to toxic levels.</li>

<li>If the canopy began as vapor, any water from it would
be superheated. This scenario essentially starts with most
of the Flood waters boiled off. Noah and company would be
poached. If the water began as ice in orbit, the
gravitational potential energy would likewise raise the
temperature past boiling.</li>

<li>A canopy of any significant thickness would have
blocked a great deal of light, lowering the temperature of
the earth greatly before the Flood.</li>

<li>Any water above the ozone layer would not be shielded
from ultraviolet light, and the light would break apart the
water molecules.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Hydroplate.</b> 
<a href="#r5Brown">Walt Brown</a>'s model proposes that the
Flood waters came from a layer of water about ten miles
underground, which was released by a catastrophic rupture
of the earth's crust, shot above the atmosphere, and fell
as rain.</p>

<ul>
<li>How was the water contained? Rock, at least the rock
which makes up the earth's crust, doesn't float. The water
would have been forced to the surface long before Noah's
time, or Adam's time for that matter.</li>

<li>Even a mile deep, the earth is boiling hot, and thus
the reservoir of water would be superheated. Further heat
would be added by the energy of the water falling from
above the atmosphere. As with the vapor canopy model, Noah
would have been poached.</li>

<li>Where is the evidence? The escaping waters would have
eroded the sides of the fissures, producing poorly sorted
basaltic erosional deposits. These would be concentrated
mainly near the fissures, but some would be shot thousands
of miles along with the water. (Noah would have had to
worry about falling rocks along with the rain.) Such
deposits would be quite noticeable but have never been
seen.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Comet.</b> Kent Hovind proposed that the Flood water
came from a comet which broke up and fell on the earth.
Again, this has the problem of the heat from the
gravitational potential energy. The water would be steam by
the time it reached the surface of the earth.</p>

<p><b>Runaway subduction.</b> John Baumgardner created the
runaway subduction model, which proposes that the pre-Flood
lithosphere (ocean floor), being denser than the underlying
mantle, began sinking. The heat released in the process
decreased the viscosity of the mantle, so the process
accelerated catastrophically. All the original lithosphere
became subducted; the rising magma which replaced it raised
the ocean floor, causing sea levels to rise and boiling off
enough of the ocean to cause 150 days of rain. When it
cooled, the ocean floor lowered again, and the Flood waters
receded. Sedimentary mountains such as the Sierras and
Andes rose after the Flood by isostatic rebound.
[<a href="#r5Baumgardner1990a">Baumgardner, 1990a</a>; 
<a href="#r5Austin">Austin et al., 1994</a>]</p>

<ul>
<li>The main difficulty of this theory is that it
admittedly doesn't work without miracles. 
[<a href="#r5Baumgardner1990a">Baumgardner,
1990a</a>, 
<a href="#r5Baumgardner1990b">1990b</a>] The thermal 
diffusivity of the earth, for
example, would have to increase 10,000 fold to get the
subduction rates proposed 
[<a href="#r5Matsumura">Matsumura, 1997</a>], and miracles
are also necessary to cool the new ocean floor and to raise
sedimentary mountains in months rather than in the millions
of years it would ordinarily take.</li>

<li>Baumgardner estimates a release of 10<sup>28</sup>
joules from the subduction process. This is more than
enough to boil off all the oceans. In addition, Baumgardner
postulates that the mantle was much hotter before the Flood
(giving it greater viscosity); that heat would have to go
somewhere, too.</li>

<li>Cenozoic sediments are post-Flood according to this
model. Yet fossils from Cenozoic sediments alone show a
65-million-year record of evolution, including a great deal
of the diversification of mammals and angiosperms.
[<a href="#r5Carroll">Carroll, 1997</a>, chpts. 5, 6, 
&amp; 13]</li>

<li>Subduction on the scale Baumgardner proposes would have
produced very much more vulcanism around plate boundaries
than we see. 
[<a href="#r5Matsumura">Matsumura, 1997</a>]</li>
</ul>

<p><b>New ocean basins.</b> Most flood models (including
those above, possibly excepting Hovind's) deal with the
water after the flood by proposing that it became our
present oceans. The earth's terrain, according to this
model, was much, much flatter during the Flood, and through
cataclysms, the mountains were pushed up and the ocean
basins lowered. (Brown proposes that the cataclysms were
caused by the crust sliding around on a cushion of water;
Whitcomb &amp; Morris don't give a cause.)</p>

<ul>
<li>How could such a change be effected? To change the
density and/or temperature of at least a quarter of the
earth's crust fast enough to raise and lower the ocean
floor in a matter of months would require mechanisms beyond
any proposed in any of the flood models.</li>

<li>Why are most sediments on high ground? Most sediments
are carried until the water slows down or stops. If the
water stopped in the oceans, we should expect more
sediments there. Baumgardner's own modeling shows that,
during the Flood, currents would be faster over continents
than over ocean basins 
[<a href="#r5Baumgardner1994">Baumgardner, 1994</a>], 
so sediments
should, on the whole, be removed from continents and
deposited in ocean basins. Yet sediments on the ocean basin
average 0.6 km thick, while on continents (including
continental shelves), they average 2.6 km thick.
[<a href="#r5Poldervaart">Poldervaart, 1955</a>]</li>

<li>Where's the evidence? The water draining from the
continents would have produced tremendous torrents. There
is evidence of similar flooding in the Scablands of
Washington state (from the draining of a lake after the
breaking of an ice dam) and on the far western floor of the
Mediterranean Sea (from the ocean breaking through the
Straits of Gibralter). Why is such evidence not found
worldwide?</li>

<li>How did the ark survive the process? Such a wholesale
restructuring of the earth's topography, compressed into
just a few months, would have produced tsunamis large
enough to circle the earth. The aftershocks alone would
have been devastating for years afterwards.</li>

<h2><a name="implications"></a>6. Implications of a Flood</h2>

<p>A global flood would have produce evidence contrary to
the evidence we see.</p>

<p><b>How do you explain the relative ages of
mountains?</b> For example, why weren't the Sierra Nevadas
eroded as much as the Appalachians during the Flood?</p>

<p><b>Why is there no evidence of a flood in ice core
series?</b> Ice cores from Greenland have been dated back
more than 40,000 years by counting annual layers. 
[<a href="#r6Johnsen">Johnsen et al, 1992,</a>; 
<a href="#r6Alley">Alley et al, 1993</a>] 
A worldwide flood would be
expected to leave a layer of sediments, noticeable changes
in salinity and oxygen isotope ratios, fractures from
buoyancy and thermal stresses, a hiatus in trapped air
bubbles, and probably other evidence. Why doesn't such
evidence show up?</p>

<p><b>How are the polar ice caps even possible?</b> Such a
mass of water as the Flood would have provided sufficient
buoyancy to float the polar caps off their beds and break
them up. They wouldn't regrow quickly. In fact, the
Greenland ice cap would <i>not</i> regrow under modern
(last 10 ky) climatic conditions.</p>

<p><b>Why did the Flood not leave traces on the sea
floors?</b> A year long flood should be recognizable in sea
bottom cores by (1) an uncharacteristic amount of
terrestrial detritus, (2) different grain size
distributions in the sediment, (3) a shift in oxygen
isotope ratios (rain has a different isotopic composition
from seawater), (4) a massive extinction, and (n) other
characters. Why do none of these show up?</p>

<p><b>Why is there no evidence of a flood in tree ring
dating?</b> Tree ring records go back more than 10,000
years, with no evidence of a catastrophe during that time.

<h2><a name="georecord"></a>7. Producing the Geological Record</h2>

<p>Most people who believe in a global flood also believe
that the flood was responsible for creating all
fossil-bearing strata. (The alternative, that the strata
were laid down slowly and thus represent a time sequence of
several generations at least, would prove that some kind of
evolutionary process occurred.) However, there is a great
deal of contrary evidence.</p>

<p>Before you argue that fossil evidence was dated and
interpreted to meet evolutionary assumptions, remember that
the geological column and the relative dates therein were
laid out by people who believed divine creation, before
Darwin even formulated his theory. (See, for example, 
<a href="#r7Moore">Moore [1973]</a>, 
or the closing pages of 
<a href="#r7Dawson">Dawson [1868]</a>.)</p>

<p><b>Why are geological eras consistent worldwide?</b> How
do you explain worldwide agreement between "apparent"
geological eras and several different (independent)
radiometric and nonradiometric dating methods? 
[e.g., 
<a href="#r7Short">Short et al, 1991</a>]</p>

<p><b>How was the fossil record sorted in an order
convenient for evolution?</b> Ecological zonation,
hydrodynamic sorting, and differential escape fail to
explain:</p>

<ul>
<li>the extremely good sorting observed. Why didn't at
least one dinosaur make it to the high ground with the
elephants?</li>

<li>the relative positions of plants and other non-motile
life. (<a href="#r7Yun">Yun, 1989</a>, 
describes beautifully preserved algae
from Late Precambrian sediments. Why don't any
modern-looking plants appear that low in the geological
column?)</li>

<li>why some groups of organisms, such as mollusks, are
found in many geologic strata.</li>

<li>why organisms (such as brachiopods) which are very
similar hydrodynamically (all nearly the same size, shape,
and weight) are still perfectly sorted.</li>

<li>why extinct animals which lived in the same niches as
present animals didn't survive as well. Why did no
pterodons make it to high ground?</li>

<li>how coral reefs hundreds of feet thick and miles long
were preserved intact with other fossils below them.</li>

<li>why small organisms dominate the lower strata, whereas
fluid mechanics says they would sink slower and thus end up
in upper strata.</li>

<li>why artifacts such as footprints and burrows are also
sorted. [<a href="#r7Crimes">Crimes &amp; Droser, 1992</a>]</li>

<li>why no human artifacts are found except in the very
uppermost strata. If, at the time of the Flood, the earth
was overpopulated by people with technology for
shipbuilding, why were none of their tools or buildings
mixed with trilobite or dinosaur fossils?</li>

<li>why different parts of the same organisms are sorted
together. Pollen and spores are found in association with
the trunks, leaves, branches, and roots produced by the
same plants 
[<a href="#r7Stewart">Stewart, 1983</a>].</li>

<li>why ecological information is consistent within but not
between layers. Fossil pollen is one of the more important
indicators of different levels of strata. Each plant has
different and distinct pollen, and, by telling which plants
produced the fossil pollen, it is easy to see what the
climate was like in different strata. Was the pollen
hydraulically sorted by the flood water so that the
climatic evidence is different for each layer?</li>
</ul>

<p><b>How do surface features appear far from the
surface?</b> Deep in the geologic column there are
formations which could have originated only on the surface,

<p>
How could these have appeared in the midst of a
catastrophic flood? 
</p>


<p><b>How does a global flood explain angular
unconformities?</b> These are where one set of layers of
sediments have been extensively modified (e.g., tilted) and
eroded before a second set of layers were deposited on top.
They thus seem to require at least two periods of
deposition (more, where there is more than one
unconformity) with long periods of time in between to
account for the deformation, erosion, and weathering
observed.</p>

<p><b>How were mountains and valleys formed?</b> Many very
tall mountains are composed of sedimentary rocks. (The
summit of Everest is composed of deep-marine limestone,
with fossils of ocean-bottom dwelling crinoids 
[<a href="#r7Gansser">Gansser, 1964</a>].) 
If these were formed during the Flood, how did they
reach their present height, and when were the valleys
between them eroded away? Keep in mind that many valleys
were clearly carved by glacial erosion, which is a slow
process.</p>

<p><b>When did granite batholiths form?</b> Some of these
are intruded into older sediments and have younger
sediments on their eroded top surfaces. It takes a long
time for magma to cool into granite, nor does granite erode
very quickly. [For example, see 
<a href="#r7Donohoe">Donohoe &amp; Grantham, 1989</a>, 
for locations of contact between the South Mountain
Batholith and the Meugma Group of sediments, as well as
some angular unconformities.]</p>

<p><b>How can a single flood be responsible for such
extensively detailed layering?</b> One formation in New
Jersey is six kilometers thick. If we grant 400 days for
this to settle, and ignore possible compaction since the
Flood, we still have 15 meters of sediment settling <i>per
day</i>. And yet despite this, the chemical properties of
the rock are neatly layered, with great changes (e.g.) in
percent carbonate occurring within a few centimeters in the
vertical direction. How does such a neat sorting process
occur in the violent context of a universal flood dropping
15 meters of sediment per day? How can you explain a thin
layer of high carbonate sediment being deposited over an
area of ten thousand square kilometers for some thirty
minutes, followed by thirty minutes of low carbonate
deposition, etc.? 
[<a href="#r7Zimmer">Zimmer, 1992</a>]</p>

<p><b>How do you explain the formation of varves?</b> The
Green River formation in Wyoming contains 20,000,000 annual
layers, or varves, identical to those being laid down today
in certain lakes. The sediments are so fine that each layer
would have required over a month to settle.</p>

<p><b>How could a flood deposit layered fossil forests?</b>
Stratigraphic sections showing a dozen or more mature
forests layered atop each other--all with upright trunks,
in-place roots, and well-developed soil--appear in many
locations. One example, the Joggins section along the Bay
of Fundy, shows a continuous section 2750 meters thick
(along a 48-km sea cliff) with multiple in-place forests,
some separated by hundreds of feet of strata, some even
showing evidence of forest fires. 
[<a href="#r7Ferguson">Ferguson, 1988</a>. For
other examples, see 
<a href="#r7Dawson">Dawson, 1868</a>; 
<a href="#r7Cristie">Cristie &amp; McMillan, 1991</a>; 
<a href="#r7Gastaldo">Gastaldo, 1990</a>; 
<a href="#r7Yuretich">Yuretich, 1994</a>.] Creationists point
to logs sinking in a lake below Mt. St. Helens as an
example of how a flood can deposit vertical trunks, but
deposition by flood fails to explain the roots, the soil,
the layering, and other features found in such places.</p>

<p><b>Where did all the heat go?</b> If the geologic record
was deposited in a year, then the events it records must
also have occurred within a year. Some of these events
release significant amounts of heat.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Magma.</b> The geologic record includes roughly 8 x
10<sup>24</sup> grams of lava flows and igneous intrusions.
Assuming (conservatively) a specific heat of 0.15, this
magma would release 5.4 x 10<sup>27</sup> joules while
cooling 1100 degrees C. In addition, the heat of
crystallization as the magma solidifies would release a
great deal more heat.</li>

<li><b>Limestone formation.</b> There are roughly 5 x
10<sup>23</sup> grams of limestone in the earth's sediments
[<a href="#r7Poldervaart">Poldervaart, 1955</a>], and the 
formation of calcite releases
about 11,290 joules/gram 
[<a href="#r7Weast">Weast, 1974</a>, p. D63]. If only 10%
of the limestone were formed during the Flood, the 5.6 x
10<sup>26</sup> joules of heat released would be enough to
boil the flood waters.</li>

<li><b>Meteorite impacts.</b> Erosion and crustal movements
have erased an unknown number of impact craters on earth,
but Creationists Whitcomb and DeYoung suggest that
cratering to the extent seen on the Moon and Mercury
occurred on earth during the year of Noah's Flood. The heat
from just one of the largest lunar impacts released an
estimated 3 x 10<sup>26</sup> joules; the same sized object
falling to earth would release even more energy. 
[<a href="#r7Fezer">Fezer</a>, pp. 45-46]</li>

<li><b>Other.</b> Other possibly significant heat sources
are radioactive decay (some Creationists claim that
radioactive decay rates were much higher during the Flood
to account for consistently old radiometric dates);
biological decay (think of the heat released in compost
piles); and compression of sediments.</li>
</ul>

<p> 5.6 x 10<sup>26</sup> joules is enough to heat the oceans to
boiling. 3.7 x 10<sup>27</sup> joules will vaporize them
completely. Since steam and air have a lower heat capacity than
water, the steam released will quickly raise the temperature of the
atmosphere over 1000 C. At these temperatures, much of the
atmosphere would boil off the Earth. </p>


<p>Aside from losing its atmosphere, Earth can only get rid
of heat by radiating it to space, and it can't radiate
significantly more heat than it gets from the sun unless it
is a great deal hotter than it is now. (It is very nearly
at thermal equilibrium now.) If there weren't many millions
of years to radiate the heat from the above processes, the
earth would still be unlivably hot.</p>

<p>As shown in section 5, all the mechanisms proposed for
causing the Flood already provide more than enough energy
to vaporize it as well. These additional factors only make
the heat problem worse.</p>

<p><b>How were limestone deposits formed?</b> Much
limestone is made of the skeletons of zillions of
microscopic sea animals. Some deposits are thousands of
meters thick. Were all those animals alive when the Flood
started? If not, how do you explain the well-ordered
sequence of fossils in the deposits? Roughly 1.5 x
10<sup>15</sup> grams of calcium carbonate are deposited on
the ocean floor each year. 
[<a href="#r7Poldervaart">Poldervaart, 1955</a>] A deposition
rate ten times as high for 5000 years before the Flood
would still only account for less than 0.02% of limestone
deposits.</p>

<p><b>How could a flood have deposited chalk?</b> Chalk is
largely made up of the bodies of plankton 700 to 1000
angstroms in diameter 
[<a href="#r7Bignot">Bignot, 1985</a>]. Objects this small
settle at a rate of .0000154 mm/sec. 
[<a href="#r7Twenhofel">Twenhofel, 1961</a>] In a
year of the Flood, they could have settled about half a
meter.</p>

<p><b>How could the Flood deposit layers of solid salt?</b>
Such layers are sometimes meters in width, interbedded with
sediments containing marine fossils. This apparently occurs
when a body of salt water has its fresh-water intake cut
off, and then evaporates. These layers can occur more or
less at random times in the geological history, and have
characteristic fossils on either side. Therefore, if the
fossils were themselves laid down during a catastrophic
flood, there are, it seems, only two choices:<br />
(1) the salt layers were themselves laid down at the same
time, during the heavy rains that began the flooding,
or<br />
(2) the salt is a later intrusion. I suspect that both will
prove insuperable difficulties for a theory of flood
deposition of the geologic column and its fossils. 
[<a href="#r7Jackson">Jackson et al, 1990</a>]</p>

<p><b>How were sedimentary deposits recrystallized and
plastically deformed in the short time since the Flood?</b>
The stretched pebble conglomerate in Death Valley National
Monument (Wildrose Canyon Rd., 15 mi. south of Hwy. 190),
for example, contains streambed pebbles metamorphosed to
quartzite and stretched to 3 or more times their original
length. Plastically deformed stone is also common around
salt diapirs 
[<a href="#r7Jackson">Jackson et al, 1990</a>].</p>

<p><b>How were hematite layers laid down?</b> Standard
theory is that they were laid down before Earth's
atmosphere contained much oxygen. In an oxygen-rich regime,
they would almost certainly be impossible.</p>

<p><b>How do you explain fossil mineralization?</b>
Mineralization is the replacement of the original material
with a different mineral.</p>

<ul>
<li>Buried skeletal remains of modern fauna are negligibly
mineralized, including some that biblical archaeology says
are quite old - a substantial fraction of the age of the
earth in this diluvian geology. For example, remains of
Egyptian commoners buried near the time of Moses aren't
extensively mineralized.</li>

<li>Buried skeletal remains of extinct mammalian fauna show
quite variable mineralization.</li>

<li>Dinosaur remains are often extensively
mineralized.</li>

<li>Trilobite remains are usually mineralized - and in
different sites, fossils of the same species are composed
of different materials.</li>
</ul>

<p> How are these observations explained by a sorted deposition of
remains in a single episode of global flooding? </p>


<p><b>How does a flood explain the accuracy of "coral
clocks"?</b> The moon is slowly sapping the earth's
rotational energy. The earth should have rotated more
quickly in the distant past, meaning that a day would have
been less than 24 hours, and there would have been more
days per year. Corals can be dated by the number of "daily"
growth layers per "annual" growth layer. Devonian corals,
for example, show nearly 400 days per year. There is an
exceedingly strong correlation between the "supposed age"
of a wide range of fossils (corals, stromatolites, and a
few others -- collected from geologic formations throughout
the column and from locations all over the world) and the
number of days per year that their growth pattern shows.
The agreement between these clocks, and radiometric dating,
and the theory of superposition is a little hard to explain
away as the result of a number of unlucky coincidences in a
300-day-long flood.

<p><b>Where were all the fossilized animals when they were
alive?</b> 
<a href="#r7Schadewald">Schadewald [1982]</a> writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Scientific creationists interpret the
fossils found in the earth's rocks as the remains of
animals that perished in the Noachian Deluge. Ironically,
they often cite the sheer number of fossils in 'fossil
graveyards' as evidence for the Flood. In particular,
creationists seem enamored by the Karroo Formation in
Africa, which is estimated to contain the remains of 800
billion vertebrate animals (see Whitcomb and Morris, p.
160; Gish, p. 61). As pseudoscientists, creationists dare
not test this major hypothesis that all of the fossilized
animals died in the Flood.</p>
<p>"Robert E. Sloan, a paleontologist at
the University of Minnesota, has studied the Karroo
Formation. He asserts that the animals fossilized there
range from the size of a small lizard to the size of a cow,
with the average animal perhaps the size of a fox. A
minute's work with a calculator shows that, if the 800
billion animals in the Karoo formation could be
resurrected, there would be twenty-one of them for every
acre of land on earth. Suppose we assume (conservatively, I
think) that the Karroo Formation contains 1 percent of the
vertebrate [land] fossils on earth. Then when the Flood
began, there must have been at least 2100 living animals
per acre, ranging from tiny shrews to immense dinosaurs. To
a noncreationist mind, that seems a bit
crowded."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A thousand kilometers' length of arctic coastal plain,
according to experts in Leningrad, contains about 500,000
<i>tons</i> of tusks. Even assuming that the entire
population was preserved, you seem to be saying that Russia
had wall-to-wall mammoths before this "event."</p>

<p>Even if there was room physically for all the large
animals which now exist only as fossils, how could they
have all coexisted in a stable ecology before the Flood?
Montana alone would have had to support a diversity of
herbivores orders of magnitude larger than anything now
observed.</p>

<p><b>Where did all the organic material in the fossil
record come from?</b> There are 1.16 x 10<sup>13</sup>
metric tons of coal reserves, and at least 100 times that
much unrecoverable organic matter in sediments. A typical
forest, even if it covered the entire earth, would supply
only 1.9 x 10<sup>13</sup> metric tons. 
[<a href="#r7Ricklefs">Ricklefs, 1993</a>, p. 149]</p>

<p><b>How do you explain the relative commonness of aquatic
fossils?</b> A flood would have washed over everything
equally, so terrestrial organisms should be roughly as
abundant as aquatic ones (or more abundant, since
Creationists hypothesize greater land area before the
Flood) in the fossil record. Yet shallow marine
environments account for by far the most fossils.</p>

<h2><a name="survival"></a>8. Species Survival and Post-Flood Ecology</h2>

<p> "He blotted out every living thing that was upon the face of
the ground," the Bible says (<a
href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=gen+7:23">Gen
7:23</a>). If the Flood was as described, that must have been an
understatement. </p>


<p><b>How did all the modern plant species survive?</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Many plants (seeds and all) would be killed by being
submerged for a few months. This is especially true if they
were soaked in salt water. Some mangroves, coconuts, and
other coastal species have seed which could be expected to
survive the Flood itself, but what of the rest?</li>

<li>Most seeds would have been buried under many feet (even
miles) of sediment. This is deep enough to prevent
spouting.</li>

<li>Most plants require established soils to grow--soils
which would have been stripped by the Flood.</li>

<li>Some plants germinate only after being exposed to fire
or after being ingested by animals; these conditions would
be rare (to put it mildly) after the Flood.</li>

<li>Noah could not have gathered seeds for all plants
because not all plants produce seeds, and a variety of
plant seeds can't survive a year before germinating.
[<a href="#r8Garwood">Garwood, 1989</a>; 
<a href="#r8Benzing">Benzing, 1990</a>; 
<a href="#r8Densmore">Densmore &amp; Zasada, 1983</a>]
Also, how did he distribute them all over the world?</li>
</ul>

<p><b>How did <i>all</i> the fish survive?</b> Some require
cool clear water, some need brackish water, some need ocean
water, some need water even saltier. A flood would have
destroyed at least some of these habitats.</p>

<p><b>How did sensitive marine life such as coral
survive?</b> Since most coral are found in shallow water,
the turbidity created by the runoff from the land would
effectively cut them off from the sun. The silt covering
the reef after the rains were over would kill all the
coral. By the way, the rates at which coral deposits
calcium are well known, and some highly mature reefs (such
a the great barrier) have been around for millions of years
to be deposited to their observed thickness.</p>

<p><b>How did diseases survive?</b> Many diseases can't
survive in hosts other than humans. Many others can only
survive in humans and in short-lived arthropod vectors. The
list includes typhus, measles, smallpox, polio, gonorrhea,
syphilis. For these diseases to have survived the Flood,
they must all have infected one or more of the eight people
aboard the Ark.</p>

<p>Other animals aboard the ark must have suffered from
multiple diseases, too, since there are other diseases
specific to other animals, and the nonspecific diseases
must have been somewhere.</p>

<p>Host-specific diseases which don't kill their host
generally can't survive long, since the host's immune
system eliminates them. (This doesn't apply to diseases
such as HIV and malaria which can hide from the immune
system.) For example, measles can't last for more than a
few weeks in a community of less than 250,000 
[<a href="#r8Keeling">Keeling &amp; Grenfell, 1997</a>] 
because it needs nonresistant hosts
to infect. Since the human population aboard the ark was
somewhat less than 250,000, measles and many other
infectious diseases would have gone extinct during the
Flood.</p>

<p>Some diseases that can affect a wide range of species
would have found conditions on the Ark ideal for a plague.
Avian viruses, for example, would have spread through the
many birds on the ark. Other plagues would have affected
the mammals and reptiles. Even these plague pathogens,
though, would have died out after all their prospective
hosts were either dead or resistant.</p>

<p><b>How did short-lived species survive?</b> Adult
mayflies on the ark would have died in a few days, and the
larvae of many mayflies require shallow fresh running
water. Many other insects would face similar problems.</p>

<p><b>How could more than a handful of species survive in a
devastated habitat?</b> The Flood would have destroyed the
food and shelter which most species need to survive.</p>

<p><b>How did predators survive?</b> How could more than a
handful of the predator species on the ark have survived,
with only two individuals of their prey to eat? All of the
predators at the top of the food pyramid require larger
numbers of food animals beneath them on the pyramid, which
in turn require large numbers of the animals they prey on,
and so on, down to the primary producers (plants etc.) at
the bottom. And if the predators survived, how did the
other animals survive being preyed on?</p>

<p><b>How could more than a handful of species survive
random influences that affect populations?</b> Isolated
populations with fewer than 20 members are usually doomed
even when extraordinary measures are taken to protect them.

<h2><a name="diversity"></a>9. Species Distribution and Diversity</h2>

<p><b>How did animals get to their present ranges?</b> How
did koalas get from Ararat to Australia, polar bears to the
Arctic, etc., when the kinds of environment they require to
live doesn't exist between the two points. How did so many
unique species get to remote islands?</p>

<p><b>How were ecological interdependencies preserved as
animals migrated from Ararat?</b> Did the yucca an the
yucca moth migrate together across the Atlantic? Were
there, a few thousand years ago, unbroken giant sequoia
forests between Ararat and California to allow indigenous
bark and cone beetles to migrate?</p>

<p><b>Why are so many animals found only in limited
ranges?</b> Why are so many marsupials limited to
Australia; why are there no wallabies in western Indonesia?
Why are lemurs limited to Madagascar? The same argument
applies to any number of groups of plants and animals. <!--
<P>
<B>When did the genetic variation within populations arise?</B>
Genetic variation within populations would have been extremely low shortly
after the Flood.  All of the variation would have come from a single pair
of animals, which means no genes could have more than four alleles, and
most would have only one.  Genetic drift would quickly reduce what
variation existed, since populations were so small.  Any selection or
inbreeding before the animals boarded the ark would also reduce
variation.  The population bottleneck caused by the Flood would have
caused all the individuals within each kind to be very nearly genetically
identical.
The only process which adds variation to populations is mutation, and
mutation rates are very slow (about 10<SUP>-4</SUP> to 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
mutations per gene per generation [Hartl, p. 94]), so little variation
would have built up in the short time since the Flood.
<P>
Cheetahs provide an example of what we would expect to see in all
populations.  They have very little genetic variation==only a fraction of
what is found in domestic cats.  A population bottleneck about 10,000
years ago is believed to have caused this. [O'Brien et al, 1987]
-->
</p>

<p><b>Why is inbreeding depression not a problem in most
species?</b> Harmful recessive alleles occur in significant
numbers in most species. (Humans have, on average, 3 to 4
lethal recessive alleles each.) When close relatives breed,
the offspring are more likely to be homozygous for these
harmful alleles, to the detriment of the offspring. Such
inbreeding depression still shows up in cheetahs; they have
about 1/6th the number of motile spermatozoa as domestic
cats, and of those, almost 80% show morphological
abnormalities. [<a href="#r9OBrien">O'Brien et al, 1987</a>] 
How could more than a
handful of species survive the inbreeding depression that
comes with establishing a population from a single mating
pair?</p>

<h2><a name="history"></a>10. Historical Aspects</h2>

<p><b>Why is there no mention of the Flood in the records
of Egyptian or Mesopotamian civilizations which existed at
the time?</b> Biblical dates 
(<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=1+kin+6:1">I Kings 6:1</a>, 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=gal+3:17">Gal 3:17</a>,
various generation lengths given in Genesis) place the
Flood 1300 years before Solomon began the first temple. We
can construct reliable chronologies for near Eastern
history, particularly for Egypt, from many kinds of records
from the literate cultures in the near East. These records
are independent of, but supported by, dating methods such
as dendrochronology and carbon-14. The building of the
first temple can be dated to 950 B.C. +/- some small delta,
placing the Flood around 2250 B.C. Unfortunately, the
Egyptians (among others) have written records dating well
back before 2250 B.C. (the Great Pyramid, for example dates
to the 26th century B.C., 300 years before the Biblical
date for the Flood). No sign in Egyptian inscriptions of
this global flood around 2250 B.C.</p>

<p><b>How did the human population rebound so fast?</b>
Genealogies in Genesis put the Tower of Babel about 110 to
150 years after the Flood 
[<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=gen+10:25">Gen 10:25</a>, 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=gen+11:10-19">11:10-19</a>]. 
How did the world population regrow so fast to make its
construction (and the city around it) possible? Similarly,
there would have been very few people around to build
Stonehenge and the Pyramids, rebuild the Sumerian and Indus
Valley civilizations, populate the Americas, etc.</p>

<p><b>Why do other flood myths vary so greatly from the
Genesis account?</b> Flood myths are fairly common
worldwide, and if they came from a common source, we should
expect similarities in most of them. Instead, the myths
show great diversity. 
[<a href="#r10Bailey">Bailey, 1989</a>, pp. 5-10; 
<a href="#r10Isaak">Isaak, 1997</a>]
For example, people survive on high land or trees in the
myths about as often as on boats or rafts, and no other
flood myth includes a covenant not to destroy all life
again.</p>

<p><b>Why should we expect Genesis to be accurate?</b> We
know that other people's sacred stories change over time
[<a href="#r10Baaren">Baaren, 1972</a>]
and that changes to the Genesis Flood story
have occurred in later traditions 
[<a href="#r10Ginzberg">Ginzberg, 1909</a>; 
<a href="#r10Utley">Utley, 1961</a>]. 
Is it not reasonable to assume that changes occurred
between the story's origin and its being written down in
its present form?</p>

<h2><a name="philosophy"></a>
11. Logical, Philosophical, and Theological Points</h2>

<p><b>Are flood models consistent with the Bible?</b>
Creationists who write about the Flood often contradict the
very story they're trying to support. For example, 
<a href="#r11Whitcomb">Whitcomb &amp; Morris [1961, p. 69n]</a>
suggest that large numbers of
kinds of land animals became extinct because of the Flood,
while Genesis repeatedly says that Noah was ordered to take
a representative sample of all kinds of land animals on the
Ark to save them from extinction, and that Noah did as
ordered. 
<a href="#r11Woodmorappe">Woodmorappe [1996, p. 3]</a> wants to leave
invertebrates (i.e., just about "every creeping thing on
the ground") off the ark. Why should we give credence to a
story whose most ardent supporters abandon when it's
inconvenient?</p>

<p>Genesis 6-8 speaks only of rain, fountains, and a flood;
it makes no mention of other catastrophies which many
Creationists associate with the Flood. Their proposed Flood
models not only contradict geology, they have no Biblical
support, either.</p>

<p><b>How can a literal interpretation be appropriate if
the text is self-contradictory?</b> 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=gen+6:20">Genesis 6:20</a>
and
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=gen+7:14-15">7:14-15</a>
say there were two of each kind of fowl and clean
beasts, yet 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=gen+7:2-3,5">Genesis 7:2-3,5</a>
says they came in sevens.</p>

<p><b>How can a literal interpretation be consistent with
reality?</b> How could Noah have gathered male and female
of each kind 
[<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=gen+7:15-16">Gen. 7:15-16</a>]
when some species are asexual,
others are parthenogenic and have only females, and others
(such as earthworms) are hermaphrodites? And what about
social animals like ants and termites which need the whole
nest to survive?</p>

<p><b>Why stop with the Flood story?</b> If your style of
Biblical interpretation makes you take the Flood literally,
then shouldn't you also believe in a flat and stationary
earth? 
[<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=dan+4:10-11">Dan. 4:10-11</a>, 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=mat+4:8">Matt. 4:8</a>, 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=1+chr+16:30">1 Chron. 16:30</a>,
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=psa+93:1">Psalms 93:1</a>,
...]</p>

<p><b>In fact, is there any reason at all why the Flood
story should be taken literally?</b> Jesus used parables;
why wouldn't God do so, too?</p>

<p><b>Does a global flood make the whole Bible less
credible?</b> <a href="#r11Young">Davis Young</a>, 
an Evangelical and geologist,
wrote [p. 163]:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The maintenance of modern creationism
and Flood geology not only is useless apologetically with
unbelieving scientists, it is harmful. Although many who
have no scientific training have been swayed by creationist
arguments, the unbelieving scientist will reason that a
Christianity that believes in such nonsense must be a
religion not worthy of his interest. . . . Modern
creationism in this sense is apologetically and
evangelistically ineffective. It could even be a hindrance
to the gospel.</p>
<p>"Another possible danger is that in
presenting the gospel to the lost and in defending God's
truth we ourselves will seem to be false. It is time for
Christian people to recognize that the defense of this
modern, young-Earth, Flood-geology creationism is simply
not truthful. It is simply not in accord with the facts
that God has given. Creationism must be abandoned by
Christians before harm is done. . . ."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another Christian scientist said, "Creationism is an
incredible pain in the neck, neither honest nor useful, and
the people who advocate it have no idea how much damage
they are doing to the credibility of belief." [quoted in
<a href="#r11Easterbrook">Easterbrook, 1997</a>, p. 891]</p>

<p><b>Does the Flood story indicate an omnipotent
God?</b></p>

<ul>
<li>If God is omnipotent, why not kill what He wanted
killed directly? Why resort to a roundabout method that
requires innumerable additional miracles?</li>

<li>The whole idea was to rid the wicked people from the
world. Did it work?</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Finally, even if the flood model weren't riddled by
all these problems, why should we accept it?</b> What it
does attempt to explain is already explained far more
accurately, consistently, and thoroughly by conventional
geology and biology, and the flood model leaves many other
things unexplained, even unexplainable. How is flood
geology useful?</p>
