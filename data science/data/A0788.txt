                    <b>Should I put all my eggs in one basket? </b><br>
                    Openplan is not about grouping your accounts into the one 
                    - it's about linking them so that they work harder for you. 
                    Your accounts stay separate, but you can use spare cash in 
                    your current account to build your savings, or reduce the 
                    interest paid on your mortgage. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How many Openplan arrangements can I have?</b><br>
                    You are only allowed to have one Openplan arrangement, which 
                    can include a combination of Openplan Money Manager, Openplan 
                    Savings and Openplan Mortgages, or even all three together.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How easily and how quickly can I change my Openplan arrangements 
                    and sweeping rules?</b><br>
                    Once you have Openplan set up, it couldn't be simpler. Just 
                    call your usual number or pop into your branch and talk to 
                    a personal banker. If you're a Barclays Online Banking member, 
                    you can also amend your arrangements online.</p>

                    of our Openplan Money Manager, Openplan Savings and Openplan 
                    Offset Mortgages. </p>
                  <p>For the Woolwich Flexible Mortgage you do not need a current

                    <b>How can I be sure Openplan Money Manager is right for me?</b><br>
                    If you want better control of your money and your cash to 
                    work harder and automatically then Openplan Money Manager 
                    is right for you. <br>

                    No - Openplan is simply an "upgrade" to your existing

                    me?<br>
                    </b>If your current 
                  or savings accounts are in credit, then Openplan could be right 
                    for you. An Openplan Offset Mortgage can link your 
                    current, Openplan Savings and Openplan Offset Mortgage accounts, which 
                    could help you to take years and thousands of pounds 
                    off the cost of your mortgage. It also works automatically.

                    <b>What about the hassle of closing and moving my existing 
                    mortgage to Openplan?<br>
                    </b>Moving your mortgage is easier than ever and one of our 
                    Mortgage Specialists will help you out all the way. <br>

                  <p><b>How long will it take to process my application?<br>
                    </b>You can apply in branch with one of our Mortgage Specialists 
                    <br>
                    and potentially within six weeks you could start saving years

                  <p> <b>If I offset my savings to reduce the interest I pay on 
                    my mortgage, do I still earn interest on my savings?</b><br>
                    You will not receive interest on any credit balances in your 
                    current account and savings accounts whilst they are in an 
                    offset arrangement. Instead, your credit balances are offset 
                    against your mortgage balance, so you are only charged <br>
                    interest on the difference. </p>
                  <p><b>Why should I reduce interest on my borrowings rather than 
                    earn a good return on my savings?<br>
                    </b>Because the savings you make on your mortgage interest 
                    should usually far outweigh the interest you'd make on your 
                    savings balances. </p>
                  <p>For example, instead of earning 3% on your savings and paying 
                    4.75% on your mortgage, you are only charged interest on the 
                    difference between your mortgage and savings balances, effectively 
                    receiving a rate of return on your savings equivalent to the 
                    mortgage rate. So in this example you would earn considerably 
                    more by offsetting your savings than you would just putting 
                    them into a savings account. </p>
                  <p><b>How can I be sure that you will keep your interest  rates 
                    competitive?</b><br>
                    The Openplan Offset Mortgage is a Woolwich tracker mortgage 
                    - so you can feel safe in knowing your mortgage rates will 
                    always move in line with our base rate.</p>
                  <p><b>Are there any charges if I decide to remove my account 
                    from my offsetting arrangement in the future? </b><br>
                    No, there is no charge if you chose to remove your accounts 
                    in the future. But of course your mortgage term would no longer 
                    reduce. </p>
