									<h4><font face="Arial Black" color="#0000cd" size="4"><b>How Resume Forwarding Services Work</b></font></h4>
								</center>
								<div align="left">
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">Once you have registered and entered your resume information, you will be able to forward your resume to  employers in a variety of employer groups.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">There are two services you can choose from to forward your resume.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2"><b>Resume Forwarding Service </b>- Send your resume to all the employers in a particular group at one time. If a new employer joins that group any time in within one, you will be notified by email and given the option to send them your resume.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2"><b>Job Application Service</b> - Apply for Motorsports jobs posted by employer in a group. Also, you subscribers are notified by email of new jobs posted in the group the moment the employer posts the job. Your resume is sent to the employer's staffing officer as a text email identified as an application. You can insert your own &quot;cover letter&quot; text at the top of the application email.</font></p>
								</div>
								<center>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#b22222" size="2"><b>With either service, for a price less than what it would cost you<br>
									in stamps, paper and envelopes, not to mention your time,<br>
									you can put your resume in just the right hands.</b></font></p>
								</center>
								<div align="left">
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="navy" size="2"><b>More on Resume Forwarding Service</b></font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">You will be able to select specific groups of employers and forward your resume to all employers in the group at once. However, you can also deselect certain employers if you wish to make sure not to send one to your current employer or simply prefer to be selective. We also offer Anonymous Service which masks all fields that identify you and requires the employer to contact you through our website.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">Finding the job you want is often a &quot;numbers game&quot;. The more employers who have your resume, the more likely you are to find the job you want. With Group Resume Forwarding you have an efficient and inexpensive way to get your resume into the hands of many employers all at once, yet your resume is still targeted to the kind of employers you want to work for.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">Group Resume Forwarding is also great way to get your resume into employers' hands in a form they are actually likely to use. Because it arrives as a text email, it takes no handling on their part, takes up no physical space and little hard drive space. They are also very quick and easy to search. That speed and convenience means employers are likely to look at resumes from JobsInMotorsports.com first.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">Perhaps the most attractive aspect to employers is that Motorsports employers do not pay ANY fees to use JobsInMotorsports.com. As a result, this is the service motorsports employers can't help but use and your resume will be right where it needs to be.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="navy" size="2"><b>More on the Job Application Services</b></font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">Motorsports employers can list their job openings on the Jobs In Motorsports website for free. This makes it pretty likely that job openings will be listed here, if anywhere (</font><a href="javascript:popUp('../script/list_jobs.php')"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#0000cd" size="2"><b>click here</b></font></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2"> to see a list of currently posted jobs). </font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">The Job Application Service is a subscription service that you can purchase for 30 days, 90 days or 1 year. While you are subscribed to a particular group of motorsports employers, you can apply for any posted jobs in that group. You also receive email notification of new Job Listings in that group as soon as they are posted. That email has a link to a page where you can enter your &quot;cover letter&quot; text and then send your resume to them with just one click..</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">Another benefit to subscribing to the Job Applications Service is that your Jobs In Motorsports registration will be extended for as long as you are subscribed to at least one group. Normally, registration expires and must be renewed every year.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">Subscriptions renew automatically unless you cancel them so that you don't unintentionally loose a service that is important to getting the job you are after. However, canceling is easy and convenient. There is a page on the website where you can conveniently cancel your subscriptions and we even notify you by emails 10 days and 2 days prior to each automatic renewal.</font></p>
