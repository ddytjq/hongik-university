Intelligent Design (Again)</h3><h4>The latest attack on evolution is cleverlyargued, biologically informed-and wrong.</h4><b>H. Allen Orr</b><P><i>Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge toEvolution</i><br>Michael J. Behe<br><FONT SIZE=3>Free Press, $25</FONT><HR><P><FONT SIZE=3>Just don't pull the knot tight before being certainthat you have got hold of the right end.</FONT><br>-Wittgenstein<A HREF="#1">1</A><P><td><FONT SIZE=3><FONT SIZE=+3>T</font>he pages of this magazine are not often taken upwith reviews of creationist screeds. The stuff is, after all,intellectual junk food, served up with a transparent evangelicalagenda. But now and then a reputable, or even esteemed, scientistlaunches an assault on evolution. These attacks are potentiallyimportant and, whether sound or not, are invariably great head-turners.A generation ago, for instance, the astronomer Sir Fred Hoyleannounced that the theory of natural selection was deeply flawedand could never account for the existence of complex organismslike you and me. Hoyle's objections were frankly silly, reflectingan embarrassing misunderstanding of Darwinian logic. In retrospect,there was only one reason anyone listened: Hoyle was a physicist.And as everyone-including biologists-then knew, physicists aresmarter than the rest of us.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>But the days of biologists suffering physics envyare long gone. We biologists have discovered the structure ofDNA, broken the genetic code, sequenced the entire genome of somespecies, and, to a remarkable extent, figured out how a littleegg turns into a big person (the last in a breathtaking decade).If a Hoyle were to now announce that biologists are deeply confusedabout natural selection or neurobiology, he'd be greeted, if atall, with a big yawn. There's only one way to shake up biologistsnow-the attack has to come from within.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>Well, ask and ye shall receive. Michael J. Behe,a biochemist at Lehigh University, has published a (seemingly)sophisticated insider's attack on Darwinism. His book, Darwin'sBlack Box, is well-written, cleverly argued, and biologicallyinformed. No one can deny Behe's grasp of biochemistry. Unlikea few previous &quot;biologists&quot; who have taken aim at Darwin,Behe is the real thing: a research scientist, someone who doesexperiments, gets grants, and publishes papers. Behe's work maywell represent the most sophisticated-and the most seductive-creationistattack on evolution in a quarter century. But Behe, it turns out,differs from his less-sophisticated brethren in an important way:he does not wholly deny evolution. He has no problem with storiesof moths evolving dark coloration so as to hide on polluted treesor of streptococci outwitting antibiotics. Nor does he deny commondescent, the notion that all species, including humans, are derivedfrom one or a few common ancestors. But Behe's chief claim remainsdeeply revolutionary: evolution, he says, cannot account for thecell, the very basis of life. Instead the cell shows unequivocalsigns of design by an intelligent agent.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>Not surprisingly, Behe has gotten a bit of attention.His book is, after all, a creationist's dream come true. His challengeto Darwin has been talked up in Newsweek, U.S. News &amp; WorldReport, the New York Times, and National Review. Even Judge Borkhas chimed in, proclaiming that Behe &quot;has shown that Darwinismcannot explain life as we know it.&quot;<A HREF="#2">2</A>(Revealing his expertise on such things, Bork misidentifies Beheas a &quot;microbiologist,&quot; not a biochemist.) Whether ornot Behe wanted such company, it is obvious that the ChristianRight and allied conservative forces will make much ado of hisbook. There's a brand new weapon in the creationist arsenal-areal biologist says we're right.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>Although Behe discusses his religious sentiments-henotes his Roman Catholicism, is disturbed by the ill will betweenscience and theology, and is subtly (but clearly) offended bybiologist Richard Dawkins's atheism-he never places himself squarelyin the creationist camp.<A HREF="#3">3</A>He maintains that his position is strictly scientific and thatthe data have driven him ineluctably to his views. As though toprove his scientific restraint, Behe even refuses to speculateon the identity of the designer. Although his last chapter offersmany hints of the designer's divinity, the door is left open ever so slightly tosome variety of alien intervention (although one wonders who designedthem). It's hard to say if Behe's reluctance to utter &quot;Goddid it&quot; is tactical or sincere. On the one hand, creationistslearned long ago to be discreet about religious motive. But onthe other, Behe seems sophisticated enough to see that Darwinismnever threatened any but the most literal-minded of religiouscreeds anyway (as dramatically confirmed by Pope John Paul II'srecent acceptance of evolution as &quot;more than just a hypothesis&quot;<A HREF="#4">4</A>).</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>In any case, I will take Behe at his word. His argumentsshould and must be dealt with on scientific grounds, just as hehas requested. For, in the end, Behe is simply right or wrong.And I am convinced that he is very wrong.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3><b>Irreducible Complexity</b></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>Until recently, we had no inkling of what went oninside a cell. Although biology had made great strides in anatomy and physiology, the cell remaineda tightly shut black box. Behe argues that this black box proved very convenientto evolutionists: when explaining, say, the evolution of the eye,biologists could start their story with a light-sensitive cell of the sort that lines our retinas. Evolutionists then merely tried to explain how the gross morphology of the eye-a curvedretina, a properly shaped lens-evolved. No one interrupted suchtales to ask, &quot;But how do you get a light-sensitive cellin the first place?&quot; The question was not asked, Behe argues,because everyone believed the inner workings of the cell to betrivially simple-certainly nothing that might pull the rug outfrom under Darwinism.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>But in the early 1950s, the heroes of Behe's book,the biochemists, began to pry open the black box, working outthe structure and function of molecules residing in the cell.Decades of such work have unearthed two findings that Behe claimsare of capital importance to evolution. First, the cell is horrendouslycomplicated. Indeed Behe spends a third of his book trying toconvince you of just how complicated it is. Take your pick-bloodclotting, intracellular transport, the immune response (a chaptereach)-they're all Rube Goldberg machines of dizzying complexity.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>As Behe tells it, the complexity of the cell cameas a big surprise. But his display of shock is, I think, a bitdisingenuous, an attempt to create a crisis atmosphere. To anyonepaying attention over the last century, the revelation of complexityis no revelation at all. Geneticists, for instance, have knownfor sixty years that the modest fruitfly sports at least fivethousand genes. So how could it not be complicated? You don'tneed a script to know that a play featuring five thousand speakingparts is going to be a tad complicated. Moreover, evolutionistsall know that, from the time the earth formed, it took three billionyears to evolve the first true cell but only half as long to gethuman beings from this cell. And we all interpret this the sameway: it's harder to evolve a cell than a human given a cell. But,surprise or no, Behe's talk of complexity is utterly beside thepoint. As he well knows, Darwinism has no trouble explaining sheercomplexity: four billion years is an unimaginably long time forthings to get complicated.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>Behe's second point is far more important. Biochemistry,he claims, has revealed not just complexity, but a special kindof complexity: many biochemical systems are irreducibly complex.Because it represents the central argument of his book-and thekey to his attack on Darwinism-it is important to see what Behemeans here. &quot;By irreducibly complex I mean a single systemcomposed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contributeto the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the partscauses the system to effectively stop functioning.&quot; ConsiderBehe's favorite example: the mousetrap. A mousetrap has a clearfunction (crushing mice) and is made of several parts (a platform,a spring, a bar that does the crushing). If any of these partsis removed, the trap doesn't work. Hence it's irreducibly complex.This is different from, say, a car, which continues to run aftera headlight burns out or a spark plug stops firing.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>One of Behe's goals is to show that irreducible complexityis not confined to the inanimate world: some biochemical systemsare also irreducibly complex. Here he succeeds. Certain biochemicalsystems show exactly the properties Behe attributes to them. Hisdescription of the mind-boggling cascade of reactions that occursduring blood-clotting is particularly persuasive: thrombin activatesaccelerin, which, with Stuart factor, cleaves prothrombin; theresulting thrombin cleaves fibrinogen, making fibrin, etc. Knockout any of these innumerable steps and the animal either bleedsor clots to death.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>To Behe, an extraordinary conclusion follows on theheels of irreducible complexity: Darwinism cannot explain suchsystems. The reason, he says, is simple: An irreducibly complexsystem &quot;cannot be produced directly . . . by slight, successivemodifications of a precursor system, because any precursor toan irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is by definitionnonfunctional.&quot; You cannot, in other words, gradually improvea mousetrap by adding one part and then the next. A trap havinghalf its parts doesn't function half as well as a real trap; itdoesn't function at all. So Darwinism's problem is obvious: itrequires that each step in the evolution of a system be functionaland adaptive. Biochemistry has, then, found an &quot;unbridgeablechasm&quot;-evolution just can't get here from there. Indeed Darwinismis rendered so impotent before irreducible complexity that Behefeels obliged to resurrect a notion that, since Darwin, has beenthe greatest of all biological taboos-intelligent design. Thecell, he argues, is a mousetrap: a complex machine bearing theunmistakable signature of an intelligent designer.<A HREF="#5">5</A><P><FONT SIZE=3>So the question facing biologists is clear: Do irreduciblycomplex systems represent an unbridgeable evolutionary chasm?If so, Darwinism is in a bad way and Behe has made an astonishingdiscovery. If not, Behe's case collapses and he has succeededonly in misleading large numbers of people. Behe, never shy, hasalready cast his vote: the discovery of design, he assures us,is &quot;so significant that it must be ranked as one of the greatestachievements in the history of science,&quot; rivaling &quot;thoseof Newton and Einstein, Lavoisier and Schrodinger, Pasteur, andDarwin.&quot;</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3><b>Reducible Complexity</b></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The first thing you need to understand about Behe'sargument is that it's just plain wrong. It's not that he botchedsome stray fact about evolution, or that he doesn't know his biochemistry,but that his argument-as an argument-is fatally flawed. To seethis we need to first get clear about what kinds of solutionsto irreducible complexity are not open to Darwinism.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>First it will do no good to suggest that all therequired parts of some biochemical pathway popped up simultaneouslyby mutation. Although this &quot;solution&quot; yields a functioningsystem in one fell swoop, it's so hopelessly unlikely that noDarwinian takes it seriously. As Behe rightly says, we gain nothingby replacing a problem with a miracle. Second, we might thinkthat some of the parts of an irreducibly complex system evolvedstep by step for some other purpose and were then recruited wholesaleto a new function. But this is also unlikely. You may as wellhope that half your car's transmission will suddenly help outin the airbag department. Such things might happen very, veryrarely, but they surely do not offer a general solution to irreduciblecomplexity.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>Behe's colossal mistake is that, in rejecting thesepossibilities, he concludes that no Darwinian solution remains.But one does. It is this: An irreducibly complex system can bebuilt gradually by adding parts that, while initially just advantageous,become-because of later changes-essential. The logic is very simple.Some part (A) initially does some job (and not very well, perhaps).Another part (B) later gets added because it helps A. This newpart isn't essential, it merely improves things. But later on,A (or something else) may change in such a way that B now becomesindispensable. This process continues as further parts get foldedinto the system. And at the end of the day, many parts may allbe required.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The point is there's no guarantee that improvementswill remain mere improvements. Indeed because later changes buildon previous ones, there's every reason to think that earlier refinementsmight become necessary. The transformation of air bladders intolungs that allowed animals to breathe atmospheric oxygen was initiallyjust advantageous: such beasts could explore open niches-likedry land-that were unavailable to their lung-less peers. But asevolution built on this adaptation (modifying limbs for walking,for instance), we grew thoroughly terrestrial and lungs, consequently,are no longer luxuries-they are essential. The punch-line is,I think, obvious: although this process is thoroughly Darwinian,we are often left with a system that is irreducibly complex. I'mafraid there's no room for compromise here: Behe's key claim thatall the components of an irreducibly complex system &quot;haveto be there from the beginning&quot; is dead wrong.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>It's worth noting that our scenario is neither hypotheticalnor confined to the often irretrievable world of biological history.Indeed it's a common experience among computer programmers. Anyonewho programs knows how easy it is to write yourself into a corner:a change one makes because it improves efficiency may become,after further changes, indispensable. Improvements might be madeone line of code at a time and, at all stages, the program doesits job. But, by the end, all the lines may be required. Thisprogramming analogy captures another important point: If I wereto hand you the final program, it's entirely possible that youwould not be able to reconstruct its history-that this line wasadded last and that, in a previous version, some other line satbetween these two. Indeed, because the very act of revising aprogram has a way of wiping out clues to its history, it may beimpossible to reconstruct the path taken. Similarly, we have noguarantee that we can reconstruct the history of a biochemicalpathway. But even if we can't, its irreducible complexity cannotcount against its gradual evolution any more than the irreduciblecomplexity of a program does-which is to say, not at all.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>I wish I could claim credit for this Darwinian modelof irreducible complexity, but I'm afraid I've been scooped byeighty years. This scenario was first hinted at by the geneticistH.&nbsp;J. Muller in 1918 and worked out in some detail in 1939.<A HREF="#6">6</A>Indeed, Muller gives reasons for thinking that genes which atfirst improved function will routinely become essential partsof a pathway. So the gradual evolution of irreducibly complexsystems is not only possible, it's expected. For those who aren't biologists, let me assure you that I haven'tdug up the half-baked lucubrations of some obscure amateur. Muller, awarded the NobelPrize in 1946, was a giant in evolution and genetics.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>Although Muller's essay isn't as well known as itshould be, the gist of his idea is common wisdom in evolutionarybiology. Here's an important application: Molecular evolutionistshave shown that some genes are duplications of others. In otherwords, at some point in time an extra copy of a gene got made.The copy wasn't essential-the organism obviously got along finewithout it. But through time this copy changed, picking up a new,and often related, function. After further evolution, this duplicategene will have become essential. (We're loaded with duplicategenes that are required: myoglobin, for instance, which carriesoxygen in muscles, is related to hemoglobin, which carries oxygenin blood. Both are now necessary.) The story of gene duplication-whichcan be found in every evolution text-is just a special case ofMuller's theory. But it's an immensely important case: it explainshow new genes arise and, thus, ultimately, how biochemical pathwaysget built.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>So how does Behe explain duplicate genes? He doesn't.He reluctantly admits that different genes often have similarsequences. He even admits that some genes in his favorite pathway-bloodclotting-are similar.<A HREF="#7">7</A>But he refuses to draw the obvious conclusion: some genes arecopies of others. Does Behe think their similarity is a coincidence-theyjust happen to look alike? It is, I think, clear why Behe failsto face up to duplicate genes: were he to admit that one geneis a copy of another, he'd have to admit that a copy was madeat some point in time and thus that the organism once got alongwithout it. But this implies that such systems can arise stepby step. Behe avoids this conclusion only by sheer evasion: hebrands gene duplication a &quot;hypothesis,&quot; leaves the similarityof his favorite genes unexplained, and quickly moves on to saferturf.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3><b>Irreducible Confusion</b></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>In truth, we're done. Behe's chief objection to Darwinismis flat wrong, and, bereft of this, he's got little to say. But when you do look at what else he says, you find a bizarre string of confusions and contradictions.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>For instance, while Behe claims that evidence fordesign had to await the new science of biochemistry, he neverreally explains what's so special about biochemistry. It's truethat molecules provide some nice examples of irreducible complexity,but why can't we find such complexity at other levels? The answeris we can. Here's one: the heart. The human heart is built ofa pump and valves. Remove either one and you're dead. But Beheseems terribly unclear about whether such non-molecular examplesare kosher. In one breath, he tells us that &quot;one has to examinemolecular systems for evidence of design,&quot; but in the next,he assures us that the theologian William Paley's descriptionof the heart as irreducibly complex was right on the money. Sowhich is it? If Paley's example is &quot;exactly correct,&quot;why did we have to await biochemistry? The issue is not trivial.For if anatomy didn't topple Darwinism (and it seems not to have),why should biochemistry?</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>Behe's one attempt to explain what's so special aboutmolecules only hurls us into deeper confusion. He suggests thatbiochemical examples are best because they're simpler and thusclearer. But I, for one, have a hard time reconciling this argumentwith Behe's main claim-that biochemistry is very, very complicated.I suspect the real reason Behe finds biochemistry so special isthat he has confused two senses of &quot;reducible.&quot; Irreduciblecomplexity is a formal property of a system, having nothing todo with physical scale. You might say we can't &quot;reduce&quot;the function of the system to its parts if they're all required.But if we like, we can always &quot;reduce&quot; such a systeminto its molecular bits and pieces (the heart is made of myosin,etc.). When Behe worries that an anatomical structure is madeof so many different molecules that it's hard to know if it'sirreducibly complex, he is mixing up these two senses of reducible.There is absolutely no reason to think we get truer irreduciblecomplexity at the micro- than macro-scale. This is made perfectlyclear by Behe's own example: to see that a mousetrap is irreduciblycomplex, we don't have to work out its chemistry! It remains irreduciblycomplex whether made of one kind of molecule or one million. Theupshot is that Behe's grand claim that biochemistry poses somequalitatively new challenge to Darwinism just doesn't make sense.Irreducible complexity lives at all scales.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>Behe offers up yet another contradiction when hetells us that he finds the descent of all species from a commonancestor &quot;fairly convincing&quot; but that he's not so sureabout macroevolution.<A HREF="#8">8</A>Now macroevolution is the process of getting species from a commonancestor. You can no more believe in one but not the other thanyou can believe in beer but not brewing. The strange thing isthat Behe seems to understand the meaning of both words. He sayssensible things about common descent and then about macroevolution.He just doesn't see that the two sets of statements are flatly contradictory.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>Last, in one of the stranger passages of his book,Behe speculates that the designer provided the Primal Cell withall the genes modern organisms might need (i.e., the first bacteriumcarried genes for human speech centers). If a lineage didn't needsome genes, they got lost or silenced. This notion leaves so muchof molecular evolution unexplained that it's hard to know whereto start. Here's just one problem: Although some genes do getkilled or silenced over time (producing non-functional &quot;pseudogenes&quot;),how come we only carry pseudogenes that are wrecked copies ofour real genes? In other words, why don't I carry pseudogenesfor chlorophyll or flower structure? Why don't azaleas carry pseudogenesfor brain cells? Behe's it-was-all-there-from-day-one hypothesisis flatly falsified by this and every other known pattern in molecularevolution.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>I'll be the first to admit that such non sequitursare not fatal to Behe's central argument. But they do betray remarkableconfusion or, worse, a powerful tendency to see what he wants,contradictions be damned. In any case, strings of such contradictionseat away at Behe's case, and, in the end, make it hard to believethat Darwin will be getting company in Westminster Abbey any timesoon.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3><b>Know Thy Enemy</b></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>One of the most interesting questions about Behe'sbook is why he feels especially qualified to critique Darwinism.(And not just to quibble over details, but to announce that &quot;Darwinismis not science,&quot; as he did in a recent letter to Commentary.)<A HREF="#9">9</A>To a historian or electrician, Behe certainly looks qualified.He is a biologist. But it's not that simple, as can be seen byturning the tables for a moment. If I, an evolutionary biologist,were to announce that biochemistry is deeply flawed-I've shown,for instance, that enzymes are not catalysts-I doubt I'd get alisten. I surely wouldn't get a publisher. Nor would any juristconsider my ruminations worthy of attention. But Behe stars inpublic debates, has a fancy publisher (Free Press, a divisionof Simon &amp; Schuster) and the ear of the likes of Judge Bork.Why the difference? Why is everyone an expert witness when thetopic is Darwinism but not when it's biochemistry?</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The answer is complicated, but a few things are clear.First, Darwinism matters. Many people will inevitably have questionsabout Darwinism because many people will inevitably think aboutit. By comparison, I doubt many Sunday school classes get workedup over enzyme kinetics. Second-and this has more to do with attacksfrom scientists such as Behe's-there's a striking asymmetry inmolecular versus evolutionary education in American universities.Although many science, and all biology, students are requiredto endure molecular courses, evolution-even introductory evolution-isoften an elective. The reason is simple: biochemistry and cellbiology get Junior into med school, evolution doesn't. Consequently,many professional scientists know surprisingly little about evolution.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>Now I don't pretend to know the details of Behe'seducation, but I do know this: he is not at home in the technicalevolution literature. His book reveals that his grasp of evolutionderives mostly from the pop literature (Gould, Dawkins-good stuff,but no stand-in for the real thing) and from computer searchesof the scientific literature that he strangely makes a big dealof. While I have utter confidence in Behe's biochemistry, I amless confident that he can say what soft selection, or Muller'sratchet, or the Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection is-allbread and butter of evolutionary biology. It would be easy, ofcourse, to get carried away here, and I want to emphasize thatI'm not saying that outsiders can offer nothing of value (it'sworth remembering that Darwin himself was trained primarily asa geologist, not a biologist). I'm simply saying that any would-becritic of Darwinism should know as much about evolution as anycritic of biochemistry must know about molecules. (An idea thatapparently never occurred to Free Press, who presumably will nexttreat us to a botanist's musings on the flat earth.)</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>Finally, Behe and others may feel obliged to slingmud Darwin's way because they suspect evolutionary biologistswon't do so. Evolutionists are widely perceived as uncriticalideologues, devoted to suppressing all doubt about evolution.It's easy to see how this impression arose: evolutionists, afterall, spend most of their public lives defending Darwin againstendlessly recycled creationist arguments. So of course we appearhide-bound reactionaries. (So would physicists if the theory ofgravity were dragged into court every other year.) But the truthis, I think, quite different. It would be fatuous to deny thatscientists can be intellectually conservative or prone to hero-worship.And it would be equally absurd to suggest that evolutionists haveresolved every major problem facing us; many remain. But the factis that, as in any science, evolutionists often sharply disagree. And, as in any science, these disagreements sometimes concern fundamentals. In the 1930s, forexample, Sewall Wright championed the role of &quot;genetic drift&quot;in evolution. Parting with accepted wisdom, he argued that randomchanges in the genetic composition of populations-not naturalselection-account for many of the differences we see between species.More recently, Motoo Kimura championed the neutral theory, arguingthat a good deal of evolution at the molecular level does notreflect natural selection. Here were overt attempts to circumscribethe role of selection. And the attempts were largely successful:Wright and Kimura were not hooted down, gagged or shot. Insteadgenetic drift and the neutral theory are now enshrined in everyevolution text.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>So when the Christian Right tries to tell you thatevolutionists instinctively circle the wagons whenever anyonedares question the Darwinian status quo, you should ask yourselfwhy Wright and Kimura got through, but Behe not. The answer is,I think, straightforward: Wright and Kimura knew what they weretalking about.  </FONT><p><hr><p><A NAME="1">1</A><i> Notebooks, 1914-16</i>, ed. G. H. von Wright and G. E. M.

He typically claims that irreducibly complex systems"cannot" by natural selection as all the parts <i>have</i> to be there from the beginning. But,once or twice, he contradicts these strong claims, asserting that no Darwinian explanation <i>seems</i> possible. The same waffling shows up in his <i>New York Times</i> op-ed, where he boldly states that we know of "no other mechanism [besides design], including Darwin's, which producessuch complexity," and that "such a system<i>probably</i> cannot be put together in a Darwinianmanner" (my italics). For present purposes, the distinction doesn't matter much: we'll see that it'sneither impossible nor difficult to gradually evolve irreducible complexity.<p><A NAME="6">6</A> H. J. Muller, "Reversibility in Evolution Considered from the Standpoint of Genetics,"<i>Biological Reviews</i> 14 (1939): 261-80. Muller does not, of course, use Behe's term "irreduciblecomplexity." Rather he speaks in terms of irreversibility: you can add something extra because it's merely advantageous. But, once it becomes essential, you can't remove it. Irreducible complexity meansthat evolution is not reversible.<p><A NAME="7">7</A> The situation is slightly more complex than this applies. Sometimes just <i>parts</i> of genes get duplicated. But the point remains: parts of some genes in the blood-clotting pathway arecopies of parts of other genes. See W.-H. Li and D. Graur, <i>Fundamentals of Molecular Evolution</i>(Sunderland, MA: Sinauer, 1991) for a discussion of partial <i>v</i>. complete gene duplicaion andthe evolution of new gene function.<p><A NAME="8">8</A> See J. A. Coyne, "God in the Details," <i>Nature</i> 383 (1996): 227-28. Coyne alsoemphasizes that Behe's theory is unfalsifiable: Since Behe admits both evolution and design, proof that a pathway was built gradually can't stump him.
