<p>ABSTRACT: If a non-linear term similar to the first-order Ginsburg-Landau superconducting free
energy is added to the Schr&ouml;dinger equation as a white noise Hamiltonian, it chooses a random phase
for each possible quantum state, and gives an explanation for Pearle's (1976) suggestion that this
might drive state reduction. However, this formulation does not add an anti-linear term to quantum
theory. It indicates 'collapse' of the wave function might be accomplished by a superconducting-like
non-linear, non-local phase transition in the perceiving 'plenum' (non-locally interacting brain cells,
consciousness, etc.). The order parameter is the particular 'universal' wave function. This model is
called the Quantum Phase Ensemble Phase Transition (QPEPT).

<p>MOTIVATION:

<p>It has been understood for some time that quantum theory, as expressed by the Schr&ouml;dinger
equation alone, is incomplete.  It does not allow for the selection of a unique Hilbert state in a micro
quantum observation.  Several popular suggestions have been made for the 'interpretation' of
solutions of the equation: The 'minimal' or Copenhagen Interpretation (1), the Hidden Variable
Hypothesis (2), and  the Many Worlds Hypothesis (3), but none of them makes the selection of the
realized state an 'actual  process' that someday may be tested by observation (4), although attempts
at applying stochastic theories to effect dynamical reduction have been made (5).

<p>Pearle (Version I, ref. 6, 1976) suggested that random phases associated with eigenvectors can
be used as initial conditions for a momentary non-linear version of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation which
reduces the state vector with appropriate probability. He did not specify, however, the process which
selects these initial phases, except that in a later work (ref. 7, 1985) he indicated that it could be the
result of interaction with the environment, as Zeh (8), Zurek (9), and Gell-Mann and Hartle (GM&amp;H) 
(10) have indicated, or a macroscopic measuring device (we would add: 'of which the observer is a
vital part'), as in the theory of Daneri, Loinger, and Prosperi (11).

<p>There is a later version of Pearle's theory (Version II, ref. 12, 1979) in which a rapidly
fluctuating antilinear term was added to Schr&ouml;dinger's equation. We will find that equations similar
in form to Pearle (II) may be derived without adding an anti-linear term, though we will first show
that equations similar to Pearle (I) result from this formulation. These considerations may be helpful
in examining a possible 'physical' process triggering reduction. 

<p>Bialnicki-Birula and Mycielski (BB&amp;M, ref.13) suggested that a non-linear term could be added
to the Hamiltonian which gave the following form to the Schr&ouml;dinger equation:	<BR><BR>									                      (ih/2&pi;)(<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#182;</FONT>/<FONT FACE="Symbol">&#182;</FONT>t)<FONT FACE="Symbol">Y</FONT>(<strong>r</strong>, t) = [-((h/2&pi;)<sup>2</sup>/2m) + U(<strong>r</strong>, t) + F(|&Psi;|<sup>2</sup>)]&Psi;(<strong>r</strong>, t).                               (1)

<p>The magnitude of such a term was restricted to be small (14) (15), but might still dominate once
the interaction of the quantum system with the measuring device is complete.  BB&amp;M chose a
separable form for the non linear potential. However, with the clearer understanding of the Bell
theorem and its implications, it is perhaps more desirable for a non-linear potential to have a non-separable (non-local) character, as in Pearle (Version III, ref. 16, 1984). Such non-separable terms
are found in the free energy density for the Ginsburg-Landau macroscopic theory of phase transitions
as applied to superconductivity.     

<p>The appearance of a single phase in the superconducting (and superfluid) macroscopic order
parameter breaks the gauge symmetry implied by a separable linear Schr&ouml;dinger equation. We take
this to mean that we are impelled to adapt quantum theory to include gauge symmetry breaking, that
is, if we take the superconducting order parameter to be a quantum wave function in the literal sense. 
This paper offers a suggestion in this direction. 

<p>CURRENT PROBLEMS:                      

<p>Dynamical state reduction should resolve the following problems in quantum physics:

<p>1. The <u>macroscopic body problem</u>. We would like to have classical trajectories as a
correspondence limit for macroscopic objects. In the theory of Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber (GRW)
(17), the localization process is proportional to the number of particles involved, avoiding quantum
mixtures for large objects. This is true in our theory as well.

<p>2. The <u>macro quantum state problem</u>. The macroscopic 'quantum order' observed in
superconducting, superfluid, SQUID, and possibly quasicrystals should be an implication of the
theory.  This requirement is not usually considered, as the claim that, for example, the
superconducting order parameter is a quantum wave function is merely an operational hypothesis in
Landau-Ginsburg theory. The theory presented here hypothesizes an ensemble of sets of eigenvector
quantum phases undergoing 'phase transitions' suggested by those encountered in superconductors
and superfluids, and  analogous to 2D ferromagnets with non-local interactions.

<p>3.  The<u> trigger problem</u>. It would be gratifying to resolve the mystery of state vector reduction
by finding a physical process associated with it.  GRW spontaneous localization is an attempt to open
the discussion, but does not give us a physical trigger for localization.  QPEPT suggests the
possibility that complexes in the 'plenum' may be involved in selecting a quantum phases for each
possible state, and that they mimic Cooper pairs in a superconducting medium.

<p>4.   The <u>special relativity problem</u>.  A good reduction theory should be Lorentz invariant, since
we perform experiments for the most part, in nearly flat Minkowski space.  Pearle's theories (I and
II) are, and thus QPEPT qualifies as well, since it dovetails with Pearle. For similar reasons,
superluminal signaling is prohibited in the theory.

<p>The QPEPT theory meets all four requirements for a state vector reduction theory, whereas the
three prime candidates, GRW , Pearle, and GM&amp;H, meet only two.  

<p>ANALYSIS:

<p>	In the Ginsburg-Landau (G-L) theory of superconductors (18) (19), a macroscopic theory,
the condensed phase is at least identical in form to a 'macroscopically occupied quantum state', . 
In this paper we call the assumption that this is truly a quantum wave function the '<u>reality hypothesis</u>'. 
We will assume that there is a small BB&amp;M term added to every quantum Hamiltonian corresponding
to the  effect of the observational consciousness or brain function, which behaves in the same way
as the G-L  first order free energy:

<p>				              H<sub>b</sub>  =  -b |&Psi;|<sup>2</sup>.                                                                (2)

<p>We make use of the analogy between macroscopic and microscopic behavior in the sense Tilley
and Tilley (20) have described: that there is "an ensemble with all possible values of (phase)" for the
macroscopic order parameter, .  (Schrieffer does this for the microscopic case for Cooper Pairs,
ref 21).  We expand the macroscopic 'phase ensemble' for a single eigenvector, as in Pearle,

<p>				&Phi;<sub>n</sub> = &Sigma;<sub>k </sub>c<sub>nk</sub>&phi;<sub>nk</sub> exp<sup>(-iE<sub>nk</sub>2&pi;t/h + i&theta;<sub>nk</sub>)</sup>.                                                         (3) 
<BR><BR>
Where the &theta;<sub>nk</sub>'s are randomly chosen phases for the eigenstate in an ensemble .  If we let 

<p>	                                 a<sub>n</sub>(t) = x<sub>n</sub><sup>1/2.</sup>e<sup>&theta;<font size="-1">n</font>(t)</sup>  =  &lt;&Phi;<sub>n</sub>(t) |&Psi; (t)&gt;,                                                (4)

<p>Hamiltonian H<sub>b</sub> becomes

<p>			-b |&Psi;|<sup>2</sup> = -b &Sigma;<sub>p,q</sub> x<sub>p</sub><sup>1/2</sup> x<sub>q</sub><sup>1/2</sup> &Sigma;<sub>r,s</sub> c<sub>pr</sub> c<sub>qs </sub>e<sup>i(</sup>&theta;<sub>pr</sub><sup>- </sup>&theta;<sub>qs</sub><sup>)</sup> &phi;<sub>qs</sub><sup>*</sup> &phi;<sub>pr.                                               </sub>(5)

<p>Since phases for separate basis states are uncorrelated, we obtain,

<p>            		H<sub>b</sub> =  -b  &Sigma;<sub>p</sub> x<sub>p</sub> &Sigma;<sub>r,s</sub> c<sub>pr</sub> c<sub>qs</sub> cos(&theta;<sub>pr</sub> - &theta;<sub>ps</sub>)&phi;<sub>ps</sub><sup>*</sup> &phi;<sub>pr.                           </sub>                     (6)

<p>Note that the minimum of this Hamiltonian is for &theta;<sub>pr</sub> = &theta;<sub>ps </sub>= &theta;<sub>p </sub>, that is, it breaks phase symmetry and
chooses a phase randomly for each basis state.  Also note that for a given basis state (a given p) the
Hamiltonian is phase-functionally identical to the superconducting G-L Hamiltonian for Cooper Pairs
and the XY Hamiltonian for 2D ferromagnetism with non-local interactions.  This means that one of
the consequences of this theory is the phase coherence of the superconducting medium, and also
implies that we can utilize the roughly  appropriate term 'phase magnetization', though the interactions
are non-local.

<p>	The interaction picture Schr&ouml;dinger equation is therefore

<p>		(ih/2&pi;)da<sub>n</sub>/dt =   - &lt;&Phi;<sub>n</sub>(t)| b |&Psi;|<sup>2</sup> | &Psi;(t)&gt; =  -b &Sigma;<sub>m</sub> x<sub>m</sub><sup>1/2</sup> &Sigma;<sub>k </sub>e<sup>i&theta;</sup><sub>km</sub> &Sigma;<sub>p </sub>x<sub>p </sub>A<sub>nm</sub><sup>p</sup>,              (7)

<p>where

<p>		               A<sub>nm</sub><sup>p</sup> =  &Sigma;<sub>r,s</sub> c<sub>pr</sub> c<sub>ps</sub> &lt;&Phi:<sub>n</sub> | &phi;<sub>ps</sub><sup>*</sup> &phi;<sub>pr </sub>| &Phi;<sub>m</sub>&gt;.                                               (8) 
Equation (4) now yields,

<p>			dx<sub>n</sub>/dt = (4&pi;b/h) &Sigma;<sub>m</sub> x<sub>m</sub><sup>1/2</sup> x<sub>n</sub><sup>1/2</sup> sin(&theta;<sub>n</sub> - &theta;<sub>m</sub>) &Sigma;<sub>p </sub>x<sub>p </sub>A<sub>nm</sub><sup>p</sup>                              (9)

<p>and      

<p>		          d&theta;<sub>n</sub>/dt =  -(2&pi:b/h) x<sub>n</sub><sup>-1/2</sup>&Sigma;<sub>m</sub> x<sub>m</sub><sup>1/2</sup> cos(&theta;<sub>n</sub> - &theta;<sub>m</sub>) &Sigma;<sub>p </sub>x<sub>p </sub>A<sub>nm</sub><sup>p</sup>.	                (10)

<p>These equations are identical to Pearle's for Version I, except that he has a matrix element A<sub>nm</sub>, where
we have  &Sigma;<sub>p </sub>x<sub>p </sub>A<sub>nm</sub><sup>p</sup>.  Note that the sign in equation (9)  is correct for a Pearle reduction equation,
and that we have obtained it without 'adding' to quantum theory.

<p>	In these equations the probability, x<sub>j,</sub> for one quantum eigenvector is quickly driven to one,
while the others are driven to 0, and the probabilities will correspond to those in ordinary quantum
theory.   Pearle's Version I considers the quantum phases as hidden variables which drive reduction. 
In a simple experiment with polarized light, Papaliolios (22) has found that hidden variable relaxation
must occur in less than about 10<sup>-14</sup> sec, so that the constant b must be adjusted appropriately.

<p>A STOCHASTIC THEORY:

<p>The above considerations apply only for non-fluctuating Hamiltonians. More generally, we should
consider a stochastic version.  Pearle (Version II) considers the ordinary Schr&ouml;dinger equation with
a 'white noise' Hamiltonian,

<p><img src="img.gif" width="186" height="32" align="left" >                		                (11)

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>such that

<p>				    (ih/2&pi;)da<sub>n</sub>/dt =  &Sigma;<sub>m</sub> H<sub>nm</sub> a<sub>m,</sub>                                                               (12)

<p>is the interaction picture Schr&ouml;dinger equation.  Such an equation would imply reduction of the state
vector if the sign were changed in the corresponding amplitude equation,

<p>		           dx<sub>n</sub>/dt = (4&pi;b/h) &Sigma;<sub>m</sub> x<sub>m</sub><sup>1/2</sup> x<sub>n</sub><sup>1/2</sup> &alpha;<sub>nm</sub> sin(&theta;<sub>n</sub> - &theta;<sub>m </sub>- &gamma;<sub>nm</sub>),                                     (13)

<p>where

<p>                                   	H<sub>nm</sub> =  &alpha;<sub>nm</sub> exp(i&gamma;<sub>nm</sub>)                                                                 (14)

<p>and

<p>			            &Psi;   =   &Sigma;<sub>m</sub> x<sub>m</sub><sup>1/2  </sup>e<sup>i&theta;</sup><sub>m </sub>&Phi;<sub>m.                                                                                                 </sub>(15)

<p>	2.   &lt; <img src="img3.gif" width="48" height="47" align="absmiddle" >&gt; = 0.	
<p>            3.  &lt;<img src="img4.gif" width="48" height="44" align="absmiddle" >(t')<img src="img5.gif" width="48" height="36" align="absmiddle" >(t)&gt; = &delta;<sub>nn' </sub>&delta;<sub>mm' </sub>&delta;(t' - t).                     (16)

<p>&lt; &gt; is taken over an ensemble of repeated experiments.  We shall show that the matrix element of the 
G-L Hamiltonian satisfies these conditions.

<p>	It is clear that a change in the sign of the Hamiltonian occurs at the critical temperature, as
the constant b is proportional to T - T<sub>c</sub>. This will change the sign in the Pearle amplitude equation,
and thus we obtain the right behavior without using an antilinear function.  

<p>	Our basic assumption is that each preferred basis state may be expanded in a manner similar
to that for the superconducting ground state. We allow, as in Pearle (23), that the interaction of the
microscopic system with the apparatus or environment may not only produce random phases but a
differing amplitude for each phase. The interaction produces indistinguishable microscopic energy
states in the apparatus or environment which are not seen in 'pointer' readings or observations. This
situation has been investigated by Daneri, et. al. (24) and Zeh and Zureck (25). Though this is a less
restricted expansion than in the superconducting case, it is easily seen that the more restrictive
expansion allows the argument as well.  It is easier to follow the argument put forth by Pearle,
therefore we expand the eigenfunctions as in equation (3). This yields

<p>		                            <img src="img6.gif" width="148" height="45" align="absmiddle" >                                                           (17)

<p>where

<p>			<img src="img7.gif" width="45" height="40" align="absmiddle" >    = &lt;&phi;<sub>n</sub>,k| H |&phi;<sub>m</sub>,j&gt; exp[-i2&pi;(E<sub>n</sub> -E<sub>m</sub>)t/h],                                           (18)

<p>and, as in Pearle,  <img src="img8.gif" width="42" height="52" align="absmiddle" > is a white noise function.

<p>	Now we expand the Hamiltonian, -b |&Psi;|<sup>2</sup>:

<p> 	        H =  -b &Sigma;<sub>pq</sub> x<sub>p</sub><sup>1/2</sup> x<sub>p</sub><sup>1/2</sup> &Sigma;<sub>r,s</sub> c<sub>pr</sub> c<sub>qs </sub>e<sup>i(</sup>&theta;<sub>pr</sub><sup>- </sup>&theta;<sub>qs</sub><sup>)</sup> &phi;<sub>qs</sub><sup>*</sup> &phi;<sub>pr. </sub>exp[-i2&pi;(E<sub>qr</sub> -E<sub>ps</sub>)t/h].                     (19)

<p>We obtain,

<p>               		  <img src="img9.gif" width="51" height="46" align="absmiddle" >   =  &Sigma;<sub>pq</sub> M<sub>pq</sub><sup>nm<img src="img10.gif" width="44" height="41" align="absmiddle" > </sup><sub>,                                                                                                        </sub>(20)

<p>where

<p>		M<sub>pq</sub><sup>nm </sup>  =   x<sub>p</sub><sup>1/2</sup> x<sub>p</sub><sup>1/2</sup> &lt;&phi;<sub>n </sub>| &phi;<sub>p</sub> &phi;<sub>q</sub> |&phi;<sub>m</sub>&gt;exp[-i2&pi;(E<sub>n</sub> -E<sub>m</sub> + E<sub>p</sub> -E<sub>q</sub>)t/h],                        (21)

<p>and where<img src="img11.gif" width="43" height="36" align="absmiddle" >    is a white noise function.  The argument is identical to Pearle's.

<p>	For a reducing equation, we must show that equation (11) applies.  This will be true if

<p>			     <img src="img12.gif" width="37" height="38" align="absmiddle" > &Sigma;<sub>pq</sub> M<sub>pq</sub><sup>nm <img src="img13.gif" width="44" height="41" align="absmiddle" ></sup> = A<sub>nm</sub><img src="img14.gif" width="48" height="38" align="absmiddle" ><sub> ,</sub>                                               (22)

<p>where <img src="img15.gif" width="42" height="46" align="absmiddle" > is a white noise function.

<p>	Two theorems will suffice to prove this:

<p><u>Theorem I</u>:   Let  &Sigma;<sub>p</sub> M<sub>p </sub><sup> </sup> <img src="img16.gif" width="37" height="37" align="absmiddle" > =   A <img src="img17.gif" width="35" height="28" align="absmiddle" > .

<p>	Proof: (of the three white noise requirements) 

<p>	   1. The Hermitian Property is obvious.

<p>	   2. &lt;<img src="img20.gif" width="47" height="36" align="absmiddle" >&gt; = 0 implies  &Sigma;<sub>p</sub> M<sub>p</sub><sup> </sup>&lt;<img src="img21.gif" width="37" height="34" align="absmiddle" >&gt;  = A&lt;<img src="img22.gif" width="38" height="40" align="absmiddle" >&gt; = 0, yielding &lt;<img src="img23.gif" width="30" height="43" align="absmiddle" >&gt; = 0.

<p><u>Theorem 2</u>:    Let<img src="img32.gif" width="29" height="34" align="absmiddle" > <img src="img33.gif" width="36" height="28" align="absmiddle" >  =<img src="img34.gif" width="33" height="33" align="absmiddle" >.

be also.

<p>	   Proof:   Properties 1 and 2 are trivial.

<p>	    3. &lt;<img src="img38.gif" width="29" height="31" align="absmiddle" >(t') <img src="img39.gif" width="29" height="31" align="absmiddle" >(t')<img src="img40.gif" width="29" height="33" align="absmiddle" >(t) <img src="img41.gif" width="28" height="34" align="absmiddle" >(t)&gt; = &lt;<img src="img42.gif" width="27" height="34" align="absmiddle" >(t')<img src="img43.gif" width="35" height="30" align="absmiddle" >(t)&gt;&lt; <img src="img44.gif" width="31" height="26" align="absmiddle" >(t') <img src="img45.gif" width="25" height="28" align="absmiddle" >(t)&gt;

<p>                                                                        = &delta;<sup>2</sup>(t' - t) = &delta;(t' - t).

<p>It is thus clear that the first term of Ginzburg-Landau theory (inspired by superconductivity), when
appled to the Schr&ouml;dinger equation, produces a Pearle Version II type stochastic reducing equation
for the wave function. This piece added to the Hamiltonian is non-linear and non-local (non-separable).

<p>DISCUSSION:

<p>	The free energy representing this ensemble of possible basis state phases is analogous to the
free energy for a superconductor (26), and reduces to it when the phase ensemble amplitudes are
identical .  Note that as a quantity one could call the 'quantum noise' (analogous to temperature) is
lowered, a phase transition occurs in the quantum phase ensemble which results in the lining up of
all phases for a given state. As the quantum noise 'temperature', T -&gt; 0, each 'site' in the ensemble indicates the same collection of phases. Thus the measurement process, which is tied to reaching a
critical 'temperature', T<sub>c</sub>, will reflect one unique ray in the Hilbert subspace corresponding to a single measurement or 'world' (in the sense of Everett's many worlds). It is suggested that this noise
temperature may be associated with the random firing of neurons or microtubule jostling of electrons
in the brain.  Discussion of this interesting possibility is reserved for the accompanying article being
submitted to the <u>Journal of Mathematical Psychology</u>.

<p>	The collapse of the wave function in this interpretation is thus modeled as being initialized in
a quantum phase ensemble, a picture suggested by and consistent with the literal interpretation of the
order parameter as a wave function in the G-L Theory of Superconductors.

<p>	Applications of the QPEPT theory are being investigated. Other possible quantum macro-objects, such as quasicrystals (27), for example, may be aligned by a term analogous to an externally
applied magnetic field.  We call this field, 'the quantum phase field', and descriptions of its application
awaits future papers.  Suffice it to say that the quantum phase ordering may appear in quasicrystals
as nonlocally-induced bond orientational order. Environmental conditions may be built into this field
as well, ala Bohm and Bub (38).  It is also possible that semiclassical quantum gravity may be
redeemable.

<p>	In QPEPT theory it is notable that the link between the pre-measurement Hilbert Structure of possible results, and the post-measurement Hilbert structure representing the observation is the
interaction Hamiltonian between phases in the quantum phase ensemble. This is an energy description
of state vector reduction, and thus is a possible solution to what R. Penrose calls 'the minimizing
problem' (29).   As mentioned before, QPEPT shares with GRW theory  the concept of reduction and
separability dependent on the number of particles.  It remains, however, for such a structure and
ordering to be found in the brain or consciousness.
