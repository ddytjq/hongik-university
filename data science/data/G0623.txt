<H1>Cosmology and Religion</H1>
<P>
There is an ongoing battle in the United States between <EM>Young Earth
Creationists</EM> and the scientific community over the teaching of
evolutionary biology.  In Kansas this dispute spilled over into
cosmology (see the article by James Glanz on the front page of the
10 Oct 1999 <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com">New York Times</A>).
In this article a minor part of my remarks to Glanz are quoted, regarding
a misguided attempt to use General Relativity to explain the discrepancy 
between the 12 billion year <A HREF="./age.html">age of the Universe</A>
and the Young Earth Creationists' 
<A HREF="./old_new_cosmo.html#Y6K">
6000 year age</A> for the Earth.  This huge
<A HREF="./relatvty.htm#CRG">clock rate gradient</A> defines a huge
gravitational field that would create a huge gravitational blueshift in all
astronomical observations, but no such effect is seen.
</P>
<P>
But any discussion of cosmology and religion should remember these general
principles:
</P>

<OL>
<H2><LI>False dichotomy between Science and Creationism</H2>
<P>
There are <em>NOT</em> just two sides in this issue that deserve equal time.
Young Earth Creationism is a belief held by a small minority 
[<A HREF="http://www.csis.org.uk/Survey/Report/report.htm">~6%</A>] 
of Christians,
and Christianity is followed by a minority [albeit a large one:
<A HREF="http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html">33%</A>] of all 
people on the world.
For example, Catholics 
outnumber Young Earth Creationists by a large factor,
and the Catholic Church has no objection to either Big Bang cosmology or
evolutionary biology.  Hindus outnumber Young Earth Creationists by a 
large factor,  and believe in an infinitely old Universe evolving in
cycles - a belief more in accord with Hoyle's Steady State Cosmology
that the Big Bang, but directly contradicting the 
Young Earth Creationists.
</P>

<P>
And many scientists are believers who feel that God made the Universe but that
evidence we find in Nature gives us the true history of the Universe: the Big
Bang cosmology and biological evolution of the species.  
<A HREF="http://www.reasons.org/"> Hugh 
Ross</A> is a prominent Christian believer with scientific training, who made 
<A HREF="http://www.reasons.org/resources/apologetics/kansasresponse.html">
this statement</A> about the Kansas School Board decision on the Big Bang:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Ironically, members on both sides of the debate do agree about one
thing: big bang cosmology puts their position in jeopardy. The big bang
poses a problem for young-earth creationists because it makes the
universe billions of years old rather than thousands. Such an assertion
undercuts their system at its foundation. Big bang cosmology also
presents a problem for atheistic scientists because it points directly
to the existence of a transcendent Creator - a fact they dare not
concede.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
It is true that scientists do not know what
<A HREF="./cosmology_faq.html#BBB">
came before or caused the Big Bang</A>, but that is neither a necessary 
nor a sufficient condition for invoking the Deity.
</P>

<P>
The evangelical Protestant denominations from which most
Young Earth Creationists come have much deeper and more heartfelt disputes
with other Christian denominations than with science.  In particular they
dispute the nature of the ultimate authority: the Catholics accept the
Pope as the authority, while Protestants take the Bible as their
authority.  But:
</P>
<H2><LI>The Bible is not a Science Book</H2>
<P><EM>"The Bible was written to show us how to go to heaven, not how the
heavens go."</EM> - Cardinal Baronius (1598), a quote cited by Galileo.
</P>
<P>
The Bible has many <A 
HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Temple/9917/ffc/biblical_problems.html">
self-contradictions and factual errors</A>.
Its original authors were polytheistic pagans who thought the Earth was flat
and the Sun, planets and stars revolved around it.
The later editing by monotheistic priests was incomplete, leaving a
number of self-contradictions.
Translations from the original languages have introduced further errors,
but most Young Earth Creationists in the United States would take the
King James version of the Bible as being the true word of God.
</P>

<P>
Some people claim that <A HREF="http://www.any-book.com/bible_code.htm">
Biblical prophecies</A> prove the Holy nature of the Bible.  But such
claims can be made about 
<A HREF="http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/moby.html">Moby Dick</A> as well.
Many people preach that current events are foretold by the Bible, but nobody
has a consistent ability to predict <EM>future events</EM>.
If the Bible did contain an unambiguous and successful collection of
prophecies there would be no question about the existence of God.
In the book <EM>Contact</EM>, by Carl Sagan, Ellie Arroway, after
traveling to Vega and back in the machine, puts a computer to work
calculating the digits of pi = 3.14159... which is the ratio of the 
circumference to the diameter of a circle, and finds
"hiding in the alternating patterns of digits, deep inside the transcendental 
number, was a perfect circle, its form traced out by unities in a field of 
noughts."  That would be an unambiguous message from the Creator of the
Universe, but <EM>Contact</EM> is science fiction, not fact.
</P>

<P>
But the authority taken by science is:
</P>
<H2><LI>Science is Based on Experience</H2>
<P>
Karl Popper, in <EM>The Logic of Scientific Discovery</EM>, wrote:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
But I shall admit a system as an empirical or scientific theory only if
it is capable of being tested by experience.  These considerations
suggest that not the verifiability but the falsifiability of a system is
to be taken as the criterion of demarcation.  In other words: I shall
not require of a scientific system that it shall be capable of being
singled out, once and for all, in a positive sense; but I shall require
that its logical form shall be such that it can be singled out, by means
of empirical tests, in a negative sense: it must be  possible for an
empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
A scientific theory must pass every test.  It can be falsified but never
verified, because the next datum might disagree.  So Newton's Theory
of Gravity was confirmed many times over two hundred years, but the
excess precession of the perihelion of Mercury's orbit falsified it.
By correctly fitting all of the previous 200 years of data, and also
correctly explaining the motion of Mercury and the bending of light
by the Sun, Einstein's General Relativity became the new and still
reigning Theory of Gravity.
</P>
<P>
Are religious theories falsifiable by experience?  Some are: for example, 
the theory of Biblical Inerrancy could be falsified by self-contradictions
in the Bible - and it is!  But almost all Young Earth Creationists
swear by biblical inerrancy nonetheless.  How is this possible?
Most religious beliefs are matters of faith: a belief held in the absence
of evidence or even despite contrary evidence.  Such faith-based beliefs
are not falsifiable by experience, and are thus not part of any
scientific theory.
</P>
<H2><LI>The Big Bang is not <EM>just a theory</EM></H2>
<P>
Popular usage equates <EM>theory</EM> with an untested hypothesis.  
But <A HREF="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-fact.html">
scientific theories</A> are hypotheses that have passed many empirical tests.
However, even a very well-tested theory can be falsified, as shown by
Newtonian gravity.  Falsifying a well-tested theory is the biggest
achievement that a scientist can make, and thus many scientists are
drawn to testing and retesting the best established theories.  But
these scientists recognize that the probability of falsifying a well-tested
theory is low, and thus their work may come to naught.  One can
encourage the testing of well-established theories by proposing
alternatives theories that explain all known facts but make different
predictions for new experiments.
In the 1950's the Big Bang was not well-tested, and the Steady State
model was a very useful alternative that encouraged many observations.
Now the Big Bang picture is well established, but the inflationary scenario
added on before events in the classic Big Bang is not well-tested.
Many alternatives versions of inflation have been suggested.
But do not think that these alternatives represent weaknesses of the Big
Bang.
</P>
<H2><LI>Science matters to our future</H2>
<P>
The years prior to World War II were marked in Germany by a campaign
against "Jewish science" which included relativity.  As a result Einstein, 
Fermi, Teller, Bethe and Szilard all left Europe.
Because of Hitler's injection of religious prejudice into science, the
Allies and not the Axis were first to the atomic bomb.
The next big technology will probably be biotechnology, and a failure
to teach modern biology could lead to our downfall.
We must teach our children both the methods of science and the latest
well-tested theories of biology and physics to guarantee our future.

To allow a vocal minority that disagrees to take over our public schools
is bad science, bad religion, bad public policy, and unconstitutional.
