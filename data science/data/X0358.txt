<H1>IMBA History - A Chronology</H1>

<IMG SRC="images/early_logo.gif" ALT="" WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="156" HSPACE="4" VSPACE="4" BORDER="0" ALIGN="right">
<P> <B>Spring 1988</B> - Faced with the threat of widespread trail closures in
California, five Golden State mountain bike clubs link to form IMBA. The
organization's first steering committee is selected. The founding clubs were:
Concerned Off Road Bicyclists Association, Bicycle Trails Council East Bay,
Bicycle Trails Council Marin, Sacramento Rough Riders and Responsible Organized
Mountain Pedalers. Gibson Anderson of Sacramento became the group's first
executive director. The first group of IMBA board members comprised: Jim
Hasenauer, Michael Kelley, Gary Klein, Rodney Johnson, and Don Douglass. </P>

<P> <B>Summer and Fall 1988</B> - IMBA creates and publicizes its six Rules of
the Trail. Land managers throughout the U.S. (and abroad) start posting these
rules on trailhead signs and in trail brochures, which helps them get comfortable
with the idea of allowing mountain bikers on public trails. IMBA produces
strategic advice documents such as "What to do if your local trails are being
threatened by closure," "How to organize a mountain bike club," and "IMBA's
multiple use philosophy," which said that shared trails minimize environmental
impacts, are cost effective and build the trails community. </P>

<P> <B>Fall 1989</B> - Bylaws and articles of incorporation are developed.
Specialized hold a "No Trails, No Sales" breakfast at Interbike in cooperation
with Bicycling Magazine. IMBA makes its first pitch to the bike industry, saying
that the future of mountain biking will depend on responsible riding, volunteer
trailwork by mountain bikers, and political clout. Linda DuPriest of Specialized,
and Tim Blumenthal of Bicycling Magazine join IMBA's board. </P>

<P> <B>1989-1991</B> - IMBA's office is run on a part-time basis in Bishop,
California (south of Mammoth Mountain) by IMBA president Don Douglass and his
wife Reanne. IMBA produces a regular newsletter "Land Access Alert," and
continues to provide timely strategic advice to mountain bikers who are working
to keep trails open. </P>

<P> <B>1992</B> - IMBA opens a tiny one-room office in Pasadena, California,
which is staffed part-time by mountain biker Sarah Meigs. IMBA president Jim
Hasenauer and members of the board of directors fill essential staff functions on
a volunteer basis. </P>

<P> <B>September 1993</B> - IMBA hires Tim Blumenthal, a former IMBA board member
and cycling journalist, as its executive director. This hire follows a nationwide
search that produced more than 150 applicants. When Blumenthal begins, IMBA's
annual budget is less than $100,000 and the organization has roughly 1,200
individual members plus 60 affiliated clubs. </P>

<P> <B>April 1994</B> - Five IMBA leaders meet with five leaders of the national
Sierra Club in Park City, Utah, as the culmination of a six-month mediation
process. One outcome of the meeting is written recognition - for the first time -
by the Sierra Club that responsible mountain bicycling is a legitimate
recreational activity, including on narrow trails. This meeting also leads to the
separation of mountain biking from motorized trail use in official Sierra Club
policy. </P>

<P> <B>June 1994</B> - IMBA moves its headquarters to Boulder, Colorado, where it
rents a one-room office a block from the downtown post office. </P>

<P> <B>June 1994</B> - IMBA signs a five-year memorandum of understanding with
the U.S. Forest Service that encourages the USFS to promote mountain biking
throughout its 191-million acre system. </P>

<P> <B>September 1995</B> - IMBA and the UCI host an international advocacy
conference at the World Championships in Germany. This multi-lingual conference
helps IMBA introduce its work to Europe, where singletrack trails have recently
been closed in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. </P>

<P> <B>January 1996</B> - IMBA holds its first National Advocacy Summit at
Biosphere II in Oracle, Arizona. More than 130 mountain bike leaders from all
over North America attend. IMBA's state representative network begins to take
shape. The cycling press increases its coverage of IMBA's work and starts
promoting the idea that riding with respect for the land and the experiences of
other trail users is an essential part of being a mountain biker. </P>

<P> <B>Spring 1996</B> - IMBA hires Stuart Ulferts of Kentucky as its first
development director and staff lawyer. Elite mountain biker racers such as Ned
Overend, John Tomac, Juli Furtado, Missy Giove and Travis Brown become IMBA
members and vocal supporters. Racers increasingly realize that joining IMBA and
giving back to the sport is essential to mountain biking's future. </P>

<P> <B>1996</B> - IMBA's membership grows from 4,000 to nearly 15,000. The roster
of IMBA affiliated clubs tops 250. RockShox increases its support for IMBA and
the first round of RockShox/IMBA Club Assistance grants are awarded. During the
year, IMBA and its affiliate clubs build more than 400 miles of new trails and
donate 150,000 volunteer hours to trailwork. IMBA launches its first website.
</P>

<P> <B>1997</B> - The Subaru/IMBA Trail Care Crew program begins. Jan and Mike
Riter begin traveling the country, working with IMBA clubs, land managers and
other trail user groups. The outcome of their work: a better image for mountain
biking, lots of new trails, and hundreds of miles of existing trails that stand
up better to heavy use and bad weather. </P>

<P> IMBA starts coordinating the National Mountain Bike Patrol with support from
founding sponsor NORBA. This program emphasizes trail user assistance, not
enforcement. Many land managers decide to allow mountain biking for the first
time in conjunction with a new patrol program. </P>

<P> IMBA hosts a Global Advocacy Summit in conjunction with the '97 World
Championships in Switzerland. </P>

<P> IMBA hosts the first-ever National Mountain Bike Patrol Instructor Training
Conference in Colorado Springs. Despite three feet of snow, more than 50 patrol
leaders participate. </P>

<P> That November, IMBA hires its first fulltime advocacy director, Jennifer
Lamb. Her job is to build a cohesive network of state IMBA representatives and
build mountain biking's clout in the halls of government. </P>

<P> By the end of the year, IMBA has nearly 18,000 individual members and more
than 250 member clubs. During the year, IMBA and its affiliate clubs build more
than 500 miles of new trails and donate nearly 200,000 volunteer hours to
trailwork. </P>

<P> <B>1998</B> - The Subaru/IMBA Trail Care Crew program expands to two fulltime
crews, doubling the clout of the program. The National Mountain Bike Patrol
starts adding patrols coast to coast. IMBA conducts a state reps summit near
Knoxville, Tennessee. </P>

<P> IMBA's membership, staff and budget all grow. By the end of the year, IMBA
has 24,000 individual members, a staff of 10, and a budget of $800,000. During
the year, IMBA and its affiliate clubs build nearly 1,000 miles of new trails and
donate more than 200,000 volunteer hours to trailwork. </P>

<P> IMBA's Rules of the Trail appear in Sports Illustrated. </P>

<P> IMBA's Trail Care Crew program wins a State-of-the-Art Technology Award at
the National Trails Symposium in Tucson, Arizona. </P>

<P> In November, IMBA hires former pro racer Pete Webber as its first fulltime
membership director and Dirt Camp founder Rod Kramer as its Development Director.
</P>

<P> <B>1999</B> - Midway through the year, the Trail Care Crew program completes
its 500th trail project. There are now more than 60 patrols affiliated with the
National Mountain Bike Patrol program. During this year, IMBA conducts 15 IMBA
Trailbuilding Schools. IMBA opens its first office in Europe. IMBA awards cash
grants, tool grants, and other awards to more than 100 of its 300 affiliated
clubs. </P>

<P> IMBA creates and launches the IMBA Epics Series, which celebrates big
adventure rides-the kind of rides that motivate mountain bikers to volunteer for
trailwork and fight tough political trail access battles. </P>

<P> At the end of the year, IMBA has more than 28,000 individual members, 14
staffers and a budget of $1.2 million. During the year, IMBA and its affiliate
clubs build more than 1,000 miles of new trails and donate more than a quarter of
a million volunteer hours to trailwork. </P>
