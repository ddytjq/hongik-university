This is the team of the year made up from the voting poll during the year
2001, plus the team of the month for each month as well. Unfortunately some players who have 
high numbers of votes may fail to get into the team of the month or year whilst lower ones do.
This is because the player has to compete against others who are in the same position as them 
to get in the team. Which position the players counted for can be found in the link 
at the bottom of the page.</center>

*If two players get the same amount of votes and tie for a position, these
ways of comparing them are followed until a winner is found.
1. The player with the most votes in the poll overall.
2. The player with the most votes in the most recent month.
3. The player with the most votes the previous month/year.
4. The player who has played the most times for England at the point the
   votes are done.<br>
