Assessment for NIH Minority Research/Training Programs: Phase 3
<BR>
The goal of this study is to assess and analyze NIH minority trainee educational and career outcomes, and to design a coordinated tracking/information system of minority research/training programs and their participants. Questions to be addressed in phase 3 include: <BR>
1) Do the NIH minority research/training programs work? <BR>
2) Which minority programs and which features of minority programs have been most successful in helping individual students and faculty members move a step forward toward productive careers as research scientists? <BR>
3) Which minority programs have been least successful and why?<BR>
4) What additional factors contribute to minority trainee success, including characteristics of individual participants, the academic institutions where they received NIH research/training support and/or obtained their terminal degree? <BR>
5) How can a system be set up that would better address assessment questions in the future?<br><br>
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www4.nationalacademies.org/cls/agbiotec.nsf"><B><U>Agricultural Biotechnology, Health, and the Environment</U></B></A> <BR>
The National Research Council's (NRC) Board on Life Sciences and Board on Agriculture and Natural Resources have convened a standing committee that will help identify emerging issues in the broad areas of agricultural biotechnology. The Standing Committee on Agricultural Biotechnology, Health, and the Environment (CABHE) will review and discuss scientific guidance for issues surrounding biotechnology as it is applied to food and fiber production and the environment. The group will respond to important concerns in a timely fashion by helping to design projects focusing on specific issues. The standing committee will not author consensus studies, but will recommend NRC panels to do so and bring in outside expertise as needed.  Active study subcommittees include <I>Environmental Impacts Associated with the Commercialization of Transgenic Plants </I>and <I>Defining Science Based Concerns Associated with the Products of Animal Biotechnology.</I><br><br>
<BR>
<B>Forum on Biotechnology</B><BR>
The Board on Life Sciences established the Forum on Biotechnology to foster open communication among scientists, administrators, policymakers, and executives engaged in biotechnology research, development, and commercialization.  The objective of the forums is to illuminate issues, not resolve them.  To date, the Forum has held workshops to address the following topics: Intellectual Property Rights and Plant Biotechnology (November 1996), Designing an Agricultural Genome Program (April 1997), Privacy Issues in Biomedical and Clinical Research (November 1998), Bioinformatics: Converting Data to Knowledge (February 2000), and Environmental Contamination, Biotechnology and the Law: The Impact of Emerging Genomic Information (August 2000).  Summaries of each workshop have been published and are intended to reflect the variety of opinions expressed by the workshop speakers without making recommendations.  Additional forums are being planned on other topics under the sponsorship of the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy.<br><br>
<BR>
<B>Joint Society for Neuroscience International Affairs Committee/U.S. National Committee for the International Brain Research Organization</B><BR>
This committee is a joint effort on behalf of the National Research Council and the Society for Neuroscience, serving as both the U.S. National Committee to the International Brain Research Organization and the International Affairs Committee of the Society for Neuroscience. The mission of the committee is to increase understanding of the nervous system in health and disease by facilitating the dissemination of knowledge to the world's neuroscientists, promoting neuroscience research and professional training activities across international borders, and enhancing public awareness of neuroscience worldwide.   The committee of neuroscientists works toward this mission by representing the U.S. neuroscience community to the International Brain Research Organization and the committee is also developing several exploratory outreach activities.  Efforts under development include a web-based international effort (<A HREF="http://www.iac-usnc.org">www.iac-usnc.org</A>) that delivers neuroscience seminars to an international audience.  The National Institute on Drug Abuse, the National Institute of Mental Health, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke sponsor this project.

Laboratory courses and symposia in the biological and biomedical sciences are organized with the goals of promoting stronger scientific ties, encouraging the exchange of scientific and technological information, and helping strengthen the capability of scientific communities to promote science in their own countries.  Eminent scientists are recruited to instruct in these intense hands-on laboratory courses held annually in both Latin America and in Eastern Europe or countries of the former Soviet Union.  Students from the target region develop relationships with scientists in their own regions and throughout the world by participating in one of these activities.  The capabilities of host laboratories are strengthened through the donation of equipment used in the course, as well as through increased international understanding of their work. Activities in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are organized by the National Research Council's Office of International Affairs.  The Howard Hughes Medical Institute supports this program.<br><br>
<BR>
<B><U>Stem Cells and the</U></B><B><U> Future of Regenerative Medicine</U></B><BR>
A workshop on the biology and biomedical applications of stem cells will be held on June 22, 2001. The workshop will examine several aspects of stem cell research including: the biological properties of stem cells in general, the current state of knowledge about the molecular and cellular controls that govern transdifferentiation in cells originating from different types of tissues, the use of stem cells to generate neurons, heart, kidney, blood, liver and other tissues, and the prospective clinical uses of these tissues. The workshop will consider the biological differences among cells obtained from different sources, for example, embryos, fetal tissues, or adult tissues, and discuss public policy concerns about the use of various sources of stem cells.   A National Academy of Sciences study committee will produce a report that summarizes the workshop and the opportunities and barriers to progress in this field. The study will not focus on issues of federal regulation of stem cell research, but rather on the state of scientific knowledge about stem cells and their potential applications.  The sponsors of the study are the National Research Council and the Ellison Foundation.<br><br>
<BR>
<B>Undergraduate Biology Education to Prepare Research Scientists for the 21st Century</B> 
<BR>
Future biomedical researchers will need increased fluency in the skills and knowledge traditionally associated with other disciplines such as chemistry, physics, mathematics, computer science and engineering.  The goal of this study is to examine the optimal strategies for exposing students of life sciences to interdisciplinary material while they are still undergraduates.  For more information contact Kerry Brenner (<A HREF="MAILTO:kbrenner@nas.edu">kbrenner@nas.edu</A>), Joan Esnayra (<A HREF="MAILTO:jesnayra@nas.edu">jesnayra@nas.edu</A>) or Robert Yuan (<A HREF="MAILTO:ryuan@nas.edu">ryuan@nas.edu</A>). <BR>

<B>U.S. National Committee for the International Union Against Cancer (USNC/UICC)</B><BR>
The U.S. National Committee for the UICC was established by the National Research Council to coordinate the activities of scientists in the U.S. with those of other members of the UICC, which now total nearly 290 member organizations in more than 80 countries.  The USNC/UICC is comprised of UICC member organizations in the United States, each sending a representative to the USNC/UICC annual meetings.   The USNC/UICC seeks support for U.S. participation in the UICC; briefs liaisons on UICC activities; and provides for national subscription payment to the UICC. <BR>
<BR>
The USNC/UICC also takes responsibility for conducting travel grant programs to support American scientists attending the UICC quadrennial International Cancer Congresses. For more information on the travel grant program and an application, click on the icon below.  <br>

<BR>
<B>Responsibilities of Authorship in the Biological Sciences</B><BR>
A study, including a major workshop, will evaluate the responsibilities of authors of scientific papers in the life sciences to share data and materials referenced in their publications.   The workshop, planned for Sept. 14, 2001, will examine requirements imposed on authors by journals, identify common practices in the community, and explore whether a single set of accepted standards for sharing exists.  The workshop participants will also discuss whether more appropriate standards should be developed, including what principles should underlie them, and what rationale there might be for allowing exceptions to them.  The committee will prepare a report describing the central issues raised at the workshop.  Partial project funding has been obtained from the National Institutes of Health and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, additional funding pending.<br><br>
<BR>
<B>Workshop on Integrating Education in BioComplexity Research</B><BR>
Many funding agencies are now asking for research grant proposals to incorporate an educational component into their work plans, and a few researchers are already integrating the two areas.  The recent NSF call for proposals on Biocomplexity and the Environment requires an educational activity for all applicants.  The first of two workshops would bring together the success stories to create a guidebook to inspire others.  The second workshop would invite Biocomplexity grant recipients new to education to discuss ways to get the most out of their educational outreach.  Funding is sought from the National Science Foundation.<p><a href="http://dlesecommunity.carleton.edu/biocomplexity">Click here</a> to visit the DLESE website, Biocomplexity in the Environment, which provides:
<P>a) links to currently funded projects, <BR>
b) links to biocomplexity resources suggested by the PIs (these will eventually be converted to a thematic collection for dissemination in the NSDL), <BR>
c) tips and links on partnering, and <BR>
d) tips and links onassessment and  dissemination.  <br><br>
<BR>
<B>Assessment for NIH Minority Research/Training Programs: Phase 3</B><BR>
The committee will assess and analyze the outcomes of a diverse set of NIH minority trainee educational and career programs and develop a coordinated tracking and information system for program participants.  To achieve its goals, the study will be carried out in three parallel parts.  First, existing NIH trainee databases will be queried according to criteria specified by the committee.  Second, a sample of trainees will be telephone interviewed, using an instrument designed by the committee.   Third, a trainee tracking system will be developed based upon knowledge gained from the database queries.   The project sponsor is the National Institutes of Health's National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities.<br><br>
<BR>
<B>Organizational Structure of NIH</B><BR>
The goal of this Congressionally mandated study is to determine the optimal NIH organizational structure, given the context of twenty-first century biomedical research science. A committee of fifteen will address the following questions: Are there general principles by which NIH should be organized?  Does the current structure reflect these principles, or should NIH be restructured?  If restructuring is recommended, what should the new structure be?  How will the proposed new structure improve NIH's ability to conduct biomedical research and training, and accommodate organizational growth in the future?  How would the proposed new structure overcome current weaknesses, and what new problems might it introduce?  The committee will gather the information needed to respond to the questions, making a special effort to acquire stakeholder/public input on the issues.  The project sponsor is the National Institutes of Health.<br><br>
<BR>
<B>Indicators for Waterborne Pathogens</B><BR>
In this project, a committee of experts will undertake a study of indicators of microbial pathogen contamination in U.S. recreational waters, source water, and finished drinking water.  The study will produce a report with recommendations for a small number of indicators that are deemed scientifically defensible and practical to monitor.  The committee will also consider how the list of recommended indicators might change with future technological developments.  This project will be a collaboration between the Board on Life Sciences and the Water Science and Technology Board.  Funding is sought from the Environmental Protection Agency.<br><br>
