<hr SIZE="5">
<img SRC="green.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="49" HEIGHT="131"><b>THE GREEN FLAG...</b>
<font SIZE="+2"> Here we go again. This is the starting gun, the opening whistle... 
the race is on! The green flag tells us that the race is officially started, and 
during the long events, keeps us informed that the track is clear ahead...hang 
on! Here comes that first turn!
<br CLEAR="ALL"><hr SIZE="5">
<font SIZE="+3"><img SRC="crossed.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="114"><b>THE CROSSED FLAGS...</b>
<font SIZE="+2"> Half way! Crossed flags tell us that the race is half over. It
makes no difference which ones the starter uses. He holds the cloth of the
flags along the handle so we don't confuse his meaning... if it's a &quot;hundred-miler,&quot;
this signal means that there are only fifty to go... can't back off yet!
<br CLEAR="ALL"><hr SIZE="5">
<font SIZE="+3"><img SRC="moveover.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="97" HEIGHT="54"><b>THE BLUE FLAG WITH DIAGONAL STRIPE...</b>
<font SIZE="+2"> This is the &quot;passing flag.&quot; It indicates that a faster car is about to lap me... he has
already passed me and now has a complete lap on me. This flag tells me to &quot;hold my
groove&quot; or position on the track until I am passed. There he goes... but I'm, not
worried... he may not last long at that pace.
<br CLEAR="ALL"><hr SIZE="5">
<font SIZE="+3"><img SRC="yellow.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="51" HEIGHT="118"><b>THE YELLOW FLAG...</b>
<font SIZE="+2"> This is the &quot;caution flag.&quot; It tells me to slow down; to hold our
positions until the green flag is thrown again. The yellow flag indicates that 
there has been an accident on the track, or that the track has been partially
blocked by a stalled cat or a thrown wheel or other object. The yellow flag
will remain out until the officials have determined that no one is injured
seriously or that the track is not completely blocked. If there is a &quot;safety
car,&quot; we must remain in line behind it until either the red or green flag is
displayed.
<br CLEAR="ALL"><hr SIZE="5">
<font SIZE="+3"><img SRC="red.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="110"><b>THE RED FLAG...</b>
<font SIZE="+2"> As always, this is the danger flag. Just like in a stop sign, it
means STOP... and right now! There may have been a bad spill... perhaps someone
has been hurt, or the track is completely blocked... when we see this one, we get
stopped as quickly as we can. The race may be restarted, but let's find out
what happened first.
<br CLEAR="ALL"><hr SIZE="5">
<font SIZE="+3"><img SRC="black.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="49" HEIGHT="89"><b>THE BLACK FLAG...</b>
<font SIZE="+2"> This is the &quot;consultation flag&quot; telling me to pull into the pits
on the next lap... it is often called the disqualification flag, but it doesn't
necessarily mean that I have done something wrong... a part may be hanging loose
from my car, about to fall on to the track in front of other machines in the race.
Can't ignore this signal... if I get it more than twice, I'll be disqualified!
<br CLEAR="ALL"><hr SIZE="5">
<font SIZE="+3"><img SRC="white.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="92" HEIGHT="79"><b>THE WHITE FLAG...</b>
<font SIZE="+2"> This one means simply &quot;one more lap&quot;... we've been a little too
busy to count them, and this lets us know that we are starting on that last
long lap. We're always glad to see this one, but the one we really wait for is:
<br CLEAR="ALL"><hr SIZE="5">
<font SIZE="+3"><img SRC="checkered.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="122" HEIGHT="87"><b>THE CHECKERED FLAG...</b>
<font SIZE="+2"> This is the big one, the one we've been waiting for... it means
it's all over but the shouting. We all want to get under this one first, but of
course we can't all do it. We keep trying, though, and I guess that's why you
keep coming back. Thanks for the ride? Don't mention it... come again. And
remember, when you drive your own car, although there are no flag signals,
keep your eye on those traffic signs and obey them.. they're the &quot;flag signals
of the highways.&quot;
