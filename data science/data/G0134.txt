1:</B> Early development of the Universe. The <B>Cosmic Background Explorer
(COBE)</B> satellite was designed to measure the diffuse infrared and microwave
radiation from the early Universe, to the limits set by our astrophysical
environment. The COBE was developed by NASA's <A HREF="http://pao.gsfc.nasa.gov/gsfc.html">
Goddard Space Flight Center</A> with scientific guidance from the <A HREF="swg.html">
COBE Science Working Group</A>. <BR CLEAR=BOTH>

2:</B> Artist's conception of the COBE satellite in orbit, annotated with
locations of scientific instruments, dewar, etc. The instruments are the
<B>Far Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer (FIRAS)</B>, which made a precise
measurement of the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation;
the <B>Differential Microwave Radiometers (DMR)</B>, which detected for
the first time and was used to characterize faint fluctuations in the cosmic
microwave background corresponding to density structure in the early Universe;
and the <B>Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE)</B>, which obtained
data that can be used to seek the cosmic infrared background and study
the structure of the Milky Way Galaxy and the interstellar and interplanetary
dust. The COBE was launched on November 18, 1989. All three instruments
performed well while the helium cryogen supply lasted, until September
21, 1990. Thereafter, the FIRAS ceased operating, as did the DIRBE at wavelengths
longer than 4.9 &micro;m (micrometers, or &quot;microns&quot;). However,
the DMR continued to operate normally, and the DIRBE continued to collect
near-infrared data with diminished sensitivity until these instruments
were finally turned off on December 23, 1993.  <BR CLEAR=BOTH></P>

3:</B> The COBE orbit and spin axis orientation. The orbit nearly passes
over the Earth's poles at an altitude of 900 km (559 miles). The orbital
plane is inclined by 99 degrees to the Equator, causing the orbit to precess
(turn) to follow the apparent motion of the Sun relative to the Earth.
(The precession is caused by the Earth's equatorial bulge, which in turn
results from the Earth's daily rotation about its axis.) Thus, the spin
axis stays pointed almost perpendicular to the direction of the Sun and
in a generally outward direction from the Earth. As the COBE orbits the
Earth once every 103 minutes, it views a circle on the sky 94 degrees away
from the Sun, and as the Earth moves around the Sun over the course of
a year the COBE gradually scans the entire sky. The spacecraft rotates
at 0.8 rpm. The FIRAS instrument is aligned with the spin axis. The DIRBE
and DMR instruments point &quot;off axis&quot; and observe half the sky
every orbit. <BR CLEAR=BOTH>

<B>Slide 4:</B> DIRBE optical concept showing mirrors, filters, detectors,
and beam interrupter. The DIRBE uses an unobscured off-axis Gregorian telescope
to collect light and bring it to a focus on 16 infrared detectors. The
instrument was designed to minimize response to objects outside the desired
0.7 degree square field of view. The vibrating beam interrupter allows
continuous comparison of the sky brightness with the cold (2 degree Kelvin)
interior of the instrument. The responsivity of each detector is monitored
on a regular basis using the on-board internal reference sources. The same
square field of view is observed simultaneously at each of ten wavelengths
(1.25, 2.2, 3.5, 4.9, 12, 25, 60, 100, 140, and 240 &micro;m), and polarization
is measured at the three shortest wavelengths. <BR CLEAR=BOTH>

<B>Slide 6:</B> DIRBE scan track superposed on 100 &micro;m Annual Average
Map and 100 &micro;m intensity from the corresponding segment of time-ordered
data. DIRBE scanned the sky in a helical pattern that resulted from the
spin and orbital motion of the COBE satellite and the &quot;look direction&quot;
of the telescope, which was 30 degrees from the spin axis. The scan segment
depicted covers two COBE spin cycles, or about 150 seconds, during a time
when the DIRBE field of view swept through the Sco-Oph region (bright area
above the Galactic center in the figure) and passed near the North Galactic
Pole, where the emission is faint. The brightness of the sky at 100 &micro;m
measured during this interval is shown as a graph of intensity vs. time,
as given in the <A HREF="dirbe_products.html#tod"> DIRBE Time-ordered Data
product</A>. On the abscissa, the unit of time is 1/8th of a second. The
bumps at about 470 and 1040 time units correspond to ecliptic plane crossings;
zodiacal emission is at a maximum in the ecliptic plane. <BR CLEAR=BOTH> </P>

absorbs and scatters starlight, producing the dark band that runs through
the Galactic center in the 1.25 &micro;m image; this &quot;extinction&quot;
effect diminishes with increasing wavelength.  <BR CLEAR=BOTH></P>

<B>Slide 10:</B> False-color image of the near-infrared sky as seen
by the DIRBE. Data at 1.25, 2.2, and 3.5 &micro;m wavelengths are represented
respectively as blue, green and red colors. The image is presented in Galactic
coordinates, with the plane of the Milky Way Galaxy horizontal across the
middle and the Galactic center at the center. The dominant sources of light
at these wavelengths are stars within our Galaxy. The image shows both
the thin disk and central bulge populations of stars in our spiral galaxy.
Our Sun, much closer to us than any other star, lies in the disk (which
is why the disk appears edge-on to us) at a distance of about 28,000 light
years from the center. The image is redder in directions where there is
more dust between the stars absorbing starlight from distant stars. This
absorption is so strong at visible wavelengths that the central part of
the Milky Way cannot be seen. DIRBE data will facilitate studies of the
content, energetics and large scale structure of the Galaxy, as well as
the nature and distribution of dust within the Solar System. The data also
will be studied for evidence of a faint, uniform infrared background, the
residual radiation from the first stars and galaxies formed following the
Big Bang. <BR CLEAR=BOTH> </P>

Solar elongation angle = 90 degree Maps</A>. Thermal emission from star-heated
dust in the Milky Way and interplanetary dust heated by the Sun dominates
the images at these wavelengths. The S-shaped feature is the ecliptic plane,
in which, like the planets, the interplanetary dust is concentrated. The
oval-shaped brightness discontinuity is an artefact of the way the maps
were prepared, not a feature in the infrared sky. The discontinuity corresponds
to a path difference through the interplanetary dust cloud as adjacent
positions in the sky were observed from DIRBE's vantage point in Earth
orbit with the Earth on opposite sides of the Sun. <BR CLEAR=BOTH> </P>

<B>Slide 13:</B> This image combines data from the DIRBE obtained at
infrared wavelengths of 4.9, 12 and 25 &micro;m. The sky brightness at
these wavelengths is represented respectively by blue, green, and red colors
in the image. The plane of the Milky Way Galaxy lies horizontally across
the middle of the image with the Galactic center at the center. Emission
from interplanetary dust in our solar system is very prominent, as shown
by the orange &quot;S-shaped&quot; curve which follows the ecliptic plane.
The thin lines forming bands within the curve show the structure of streaming
dust grains - the result of colliding asteroids. At these wavelengths,
the broad plane of the Milky Way, which appears as blue and pink, reveals
stars and interstellar cool dust in the disk of the Milky Way. To make
the contributions from the Solar System as uniform as possible, the images
are made from observations when the Sun angle (solar elongation) was 90
degrees from the viewing direction. DIRBE is the first space instrument
designed to make a comprehensive sky survey in the search for an ancient
fossil known as the cosmic infrared background (CIB) radiation - the remnant
from the formation of the earliest objects in the Universe created 5 to
12 billion years ago. Extensive modeling is required to isolate the CIB
from the infrared foregrounds from the Solar System and Galaxy. <BR CLEAR=BOTH> </P>

<B>Slide 14:</B> This image combines data from the DIRBE obtained at
infrared wavelengths of 25, 60 and 100 &micro;m. The sky brightness at
these wavelengths is represented respectively by blue, green, and red colors
in the image. The plane of the Milky Way Galaxy lies horizontally across
the middle of the image with the Galactic center at the center. The image
is dominated by the thermal emission from interstellar dust in the Milky
Way. The wispy-looking dust features are called &quot;infrared cirrus.&quot;
The structured, warmer emission from interplanetary dust, shown in blue,
is also prominent. The image shows a number of well-known dusty regions
in the Milky Way, such as the Orion molecular clouds (below the plane,
far right) which are active &quot;stellar nurseries&quot; in our Galaxy.
Two neighboring galaxies, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds also can
be distinguished (below the plane, approximately halfway between the center
and right edge of the image).  <BR CLEAR=BOTH></P>

<B>Slide 15:</B> 100, 140, and 240 &micro;m <A HREF="dirbe_products.html#e90_maps">
Solar elongation angle = 90 degree Maps</A>. Thermal emission from relatively
cool interstellar dust warmed by stars in the Milky Way dominates at these
wavelengths. At high Galactic latitudes, interstellar &quot;cirrus&quot;
clouds are apparent. Emission from the solar system dust (&quot;zodiacal
emission&quot;) is strongest at 25 &micro;m but remains in evidence in
the 100 &micro;m image, and to a lesser degree at the longer wavelengths.

<B>Slide 16:</B> DIRBE 1.25 and 2.2 &micro;m maps of the sky as observed
(top) and following subtraction of a detailed model of the zodiacal light
(middle and bottom), which at these wavelengths is Sunlight scattered by
interplanetary dust grains. The maps are Mollweide projections in geocentric
ecliptic coordinates. In this projection, the Galactic plane is seen as
a bright arc across the sky, and the zodiacal light is concentrated in
a horizontal band which runs through the middle of the map. At each wavelength,
the top and middle maps are shown on the same brightness scale; the maps
on the bottom are shown at a narrower brightness range in order to accentuate
imperfections in the zodiacal light model. These imperfections are most
evident at mid-infrared wavelengths where the interplanetary dust signal
is strongest (12, 25, 60 &micro;m). Such defects notwithstanding, all of
the emission seen in the middle and bottom maps is either Galactic (stars
in the Milky Way) or extragalactic in origin. The main scientific goal
of the DIRBE&nbsp;is to measure the brightness of the extragalactic component
of this residual emission, which is presumed to be isotropic (<I>i.e.</I>,
uniform over the sky). The DIRBE&nbsp;zodiacal light model is described
by Kelsall <I>et al.</I> 1998, ApJ, in press. <BR CLEAR=BOTH></P>

<B>Slide 17:</B> DIRBE 3.5 and 4.9 &micro;m maps of the sky as observed
(top) and following subtraction of a detailed model of the zodiacal light
(middle and bottom). At these wavelengths, &quot;zodiacal light&quot; includes
both thermal emission from and Sunlight scattered by interplanetary dust
grains (see Kelsall <I>et al.</I> 1998, ApJ, in press). The Slide 16 caption
above contains information about the map projection and brightness scales.
The residual emission at 3.5 and 4.9 &micro;m (middle and bottom maps)
comes predominantly from stars in the Milky Way. Imperfections in the zodiacal
light model are evident in the 4.9 &micro;m map on the bottom, where the
brightness scale was compressed in order to emphasize low-brightness features.

<B>Slide 18:</B> DIRBE 12 and 25 &micro;m maps of the sky as observed
(top) and following subtraction of a detailed model of the zodiacal light
(middle and bottom), which at these wavelengths is thermal emission from
interplanetary dust grains heated by absorbed Sunlight (see Kelsall <I>et
al.</I> 1998, ApJ, in press). The Slide 16 caption above contains information
about the map projection and brightness scales. The residual emission at
12 and 25 &micro;m (middle and bottom maps) comes predominantly from interstellar
dust in the Milky Way which, like the interplanetary dust, absorbs starlight
and gives off thermal emission. The emission from inter<I>stellar</I> dust
is strongest at longer infrared wavelengths (&gt; 60 &micro;m) than the
inter<I>planetary</I> dust emission (peak emission at about 25 &micro;m)
because typical interplanetary grains are warmer than their interstellar
counterparts. This is because interplanetary grains are relatively close
to the Sun compared to the distance between the average interstellar grains
and the nearest stars. Imperfections in the zodiacal light model are evident
in both of the bottom maps, where the brightness scale was compressed in
order to emphasize low-brightness features. <BR CLEAR=BOTH></P>

(middle and bottom), which at these wavelengths is thermal emission from
interplanetary dust grains heated by absorbed Sunlight (see Kelsall <I>et
al.</I> 1998, ApJ, in press). The Slide 16 caption above contains information
about the map projection and brightness scales, and the Slide 18 caption
describes some of the relevant astrophysics. Galactic interstellar dust
emission is quite strong at these wavelengths, while zodiacal emission
is relatively weak, as can be seen in the maps on the top. Imperfections
in the zodiacal light model are evident at 60 &micro;m but markedly less
apparent at 100 &micro;m, as can be seen in the maps on the bottom. <BR CLEAR=BOTH></P>

(top) and following subtraction of a detailed model of the zodiacal light
(middle and bottom; see Kelsall <I>et al.</I> 1998, ApJ, in press). The
Slide 16 caption above contains information about the map projection and
brightness scales, and the Slide 18 caption describes some of the relevant
astrophysics. Galactic interstellar dust emission is much stronger at these
wavelengths than zodiacal emission, as can be seen in the maps on the top.
Even on a stretched brightness scale (bottom maps), imperfections in the
zodiacal light model are not apparent. Detector noise from the DIRBE&nbsp;instrument
is significant at these wavelengths and gives rise to the speckled appearance
of the maps. <BR CLEAR=BOTH></P>

<B>Slide 21:</B> At near-infrared wavelengths, following the subtraction
of zodiacal light (see Slide 16), map pixels containing discrete bright
sources are masked and the DIRBE&nbsp;Faint Source Model is used to subtract
residual Galactic starlight in order to detect or place an upper limit
on the brightness of the cosmic infrared (extragalactic) background emission
(Arendt <I>et al.</I> 1998, ApJ, in press). Here the upper map shows the
residual sky brightness at 2.2 &micro;m after zodiacal light subtraction
and bright source masking (dark spots in maps). In this projection, the
Galactic plane runs horizontally through the map. Ideally, if the zodiacal
model were perfect, only the collective emissions of (faint) stars in the
Milky Way and the sought-after extragalactic light (cosmic infrared background)
would remain in this map. The lower map shows the DIRBE Faint Source Model.
To facilitate comparison, both maps are shown on the same brightness scale
and with the same pixels masked. Clearly, most of the residual 2.2 &micro;m
emission in the upper map is attributable to stars in the Milky Way. <BR CLEAR=BOTH></P>

<B>Slide 22:</B> Results of the DIRBE search for the Cosmic Infrared
Background (CIB) after removal of foreground emissions from the solar system

black circles with error bars represent DIRBE detections of the CIB at
140 and 240 &micro;m. (These detections were the subject of a <A HREF="dirbe_press_release.html">press

upper limits at 1.25 - 100 &micro;m; the tips of the arrows indicate the
measured residual values after foreground subtraction. Prior to subtracting
the foreground emissions, DIRBE observations of the darkest regions in
the sky in each wavelength band were interpreted as conservative upper
limits on the CIB brightness (hatched horizontal lines). The other symbols
represent limits or tentative detections of the CIB&nbsp;from non-DIRBE&nbsp;data
sources.  <BR CLEAR=BOTH></P>

<B>Slide 23:</B> An illustration of the foreground emission subtraction
process resulting in the DIRBE detection of the Cosmic Infrared Background
at 240 &micro;m. The map at the top is a false-color image showing the
observed infrared sky brightness at wavelengths of 60 (blue), 100 (green)
and 240 &micro;m (red). The bright white-yellow horizontal band across
the middle of the image corresponds to emission from interstellar dust
in the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy (the center of the Galaxy lies at
the center of the map). The red regions above and below this bright band
are &quot;infrared cirrus&quot; clouds, wispy clouds of relatively cool
Galactic dust. The blue S-shaped figure follows the ecliptic plane and
represents emission from interplanetary dust in the solar system. The map
in the middle is a 60-100-240 &micro;m false-color image depicting the
sky after the foreground glow of the interplanetary dust has been modeled
and subtracted; this image is dominated by emission from interstellar dust
in the Milky Way. After the infrared light from our solar system <I>and
</I>Galaxy has been removed, what remains is a uniform Cosmic Infrared
Background. This is illustrated in the bottom image, which shows just the
residual 240 &micro;m brightness. The line across the center is an artifact
from removal of the Galactic light. The DIRBE team reports detection of
this cosmic background light also at 140 &micro;m, and has set limits to
its brightness at eight other infrared wavelengths from 1.25 to 100 &micro;m
(see Slide 22). Credit: <A HREF="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/01/">STScI

<B>Slide 24:</B> This image combines data from the DIRBE obtained at
infrared wavelengths of 100, 140 and 240 &micro;m - the longest wavelengths
measured by this instrument. The sky brightness at these wavelengths is
represented respectively by blue, green, and red colors in the image. This
image shows where there is more material (appears brighter) and where this
material is coldest (appears redder). The plane of the Milky Way Galaxy
lies horizontally across the middle of the image with the Galactic center
at the center. Most of the infrared radiation seen in this image originates
from cold dust (approximately 20 K, or 20 degrees Centigrade above absolute
zero) located in clouds of gas and dust between the stars in the Milky
Way Galaxy. The wispy-looking dust features are called &quot;infrared cirrus.&quot;
The region of the Orion Nebula with active star formation - approximately
1,500 light years distance from the Sun - appears on the right of the image
below the plane of the Milky Way. Neighboring galaxies, the Large and Small
Magellanic Clouds, appear as faint &quot;blobs&quot; below and slightly
to the right of the Galactic center. Much of the picture appears to be
the same color, indicating that there is not a large variation in the dust
temperature. Because the brightness of the Solar System and Galaxy tends
to decrease with increasing wavelength, these long wavelength DIRBE measurements
are particularly valuable for searching for the cosmic infrared background.

<B>Slide 25:</B> Signal flow in the DMR instrument, which was designed
to detect and enable the characterization of temperature differences (&quot;anisotropy&quot;)
in the <A HREF="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/html/cbr.html"> cosmic microwave
background radiation</A>. The DMR design is similar to that used in instruments
flown on balloons and aircraft. The receiver input is connected alternately
to two separate antennas that point at different parts of the sky. If the
two parts of the sky are not equally bright, the detected signal will change
slightly when the switch is moved from one antenna to the other. The entire
apparatus is rotated to show that the difference comes from the sky and
not from differences in the two antennas. The DMR instrument has three
separate receiver boxes, one for each wavelength (3.3, 5.7 and 9.6 millimeters).
Each box has two separate and independent receivers tuned to the same frequency,
to improve the sensitivity of the measurement and to protect against a
failure. The antennas in a pair are pointed 60 degrees apart and 30 degrees
away from the spin axis of the COBE spacecraft. Each antenna receives microwave
light from a 7 degree diameter beam. The <A HREF="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/">
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP)</A>, a new NASA mission, will measure
the cosmic microwave background anisotropy at ten times higher spatial
resolution.  <BR CLEAR=BOTH></P>

<B>Slide 27:</B> Early DMR sky maps depicting data obtained from the
independent (&quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;) channels at each of the three
observed microwave wavelengths: 3.3, 5.7 and 9.6 mm (corresponding frequencies
are 90, 53 and 31.5 GHz, or thousand MHz, respectively). Like the maps
depicted in slides 20 - 23, these maps were smoothed with a 7 degree beam,
yielding an effective angular resolution of 10 degrees. Each map is an
all-sky Mollweide projection in Galactic coordinates. The plane of the
Milky Way Galaxy is horizontal across the middle of each map. The asymmetry,
or &quot;dipole,&quot; that dominates the appearance of these maps is a
smooth variation between a relatively warm (bright) area in the upper right
to a relatively cool (faint) area in the lower left. The dipole asymmetry
is due to the motion of the solar system relative to distant matter in
the Universe. Although the signal attributed to this variation is very
weak - only one thousandth the brightness of the sky - it is about a hundred
times stronger than the cosmic microwave background anisotropy which the
DMR was designed to detect and so must be subtracted before the anisotropy

- tiny fluctuations in the sky brightness at a level of a part in one hundred

is a remnant of the Big Bang, and the fluctuations are the imprint of density
contrast in the early Universe (see slide 24 caption). This image represents
the anisotropy detected in data collected during the first two years of

<B>Slide 32:</B> DMR &quot;Map of the Early Universe.&quot; This false-color
image shows tiny variations in the intensity of the cosmic microwave background
measured in four years of observations by the Differential Microwave Radiometers
on NASA's Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE). The cosmic microwave background
is widely believed to be a remnant of the Big Bang; the blue and red spots
correspond to regions of greater or lesser density in the early Universe.
These &quot;fossilized&quot; relics record the distribution of matter and
energy in the early Universe before the matter became organized into stars
and galaxies. While the initial discovery of variations in the intensity
of the CMB (made by COBE in 1992) was based on a mathematical examination
of the data, this picture of the sky from the full four-year mission gives
an accurate visual impression of the data. The features traced in this
map stretch across the visible Universe: the largest features seen by optical
telescopes, such as the &quot;Great Wall&quot; of galaxies, would fit neatly
within the smallest feature in this map. (See <A HREF="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1996ApJ...464L...1B">

<B>Slide 33:</B> Concept of FIRAS, showing light from the sky being
focused through cone and sent to interferometer. The FIRAS instrument was
designed to measure precisely the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background
radiation over a wavelength range from 0.1 to 10 mm. The instrument measures
the wavelength of the incoming radiation by using the phenomenon of wave
interference. A Michelson interferometer is used to break the wave into
two equal parts, to delay one part, and then to recombine them. The waves
recombine perfectly (constructive interference) if the delay is a whole
number of wavelengths, but cancel perfectly (destructive interference)
if the delay is an odd number of half wavelengths. The wavelength can be
measured by varying the delay and noticing where the interference is constructive
and destructive. As the delay is changed, the varying intensity at each
detector is called the interferogram. The interferogram contains the information
needed to determine the intensity of the incoming light at a large number
of wavelengths (<I>i.e.,</I> a spectrum) simultaneously. This method provides
an enormous advantage in sensitivity over more direct methods. The FIRAS
uses a trumpet-shaped cone to collect light from the sky and funnel it
into the instrument while rejecting light that arrives from unwanted directions.
The field of view is 7 degrees, like the DMR, so a spectrum can be obtained
at about 1000 independent parts of the sky. The accuracy of the FIRAS is
achieved by a large blackbody calibrator which can be inserted by command
into the mouth of the cone. (A blackbody is an object that absorbs all
radiation that falls on it and radiates heat and light with an intensity
that can be computed precisely if its temperature is known. For a related
tutorial, see <A HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/staff/blynds/tmp.html">
&quot;About Temperature&quot;</A> by Dr. Beverly Lynds.) The temperature
of the calibrator can be controlled to within 0.001 K. The detectors are
thermometers which can easily detect temperature changes caused by changes
of only a hundred trillionth of a watt in the incident power. <BR CLEAR=BOTH> </P>

the hot <A HREF="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/html/big_bang.html"> Big Bang
theory</A>. The FIRAS data were taken at 34 positions equally spaced along
this curve. The FIRAS data match the curve so exactly, with error uncertainties
less than the width of the blackbody curve, that it is impossible to distinguish
the data from the theoretical curve. These precise CMB measurements show
that at least 99.994% of the radiant energy of the Universe was released
within the first year after the Big Bang itself. All theories that attempt
to explain the origin of large scale structure seen in the Universe today
must now conform to the constraints imposed by these measurements. The
results show that the radiation matches the predictions of the hot Big
Bang theory to an extraordinary degree. See <A HREF="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1994ApJ...420..439M">

At high frequencies, the continuum in a FIRAS spectrum is dominated by
thermal dust emission; at low frequencies, the cosmic microwave background
dominates. A single-temperature dust model (with 1.55 adopted as the emissivity
spectral index) was used to make this map. Different models can be used
and assumptions made, and corresponding temperature and optical depth maps
can be derived straightforwardly from the FIRAS Continuum Spectrum Maps
