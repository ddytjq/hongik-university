ABSTRACT:  Expression of membrane-bound (mb) and soluble (s) forms of vascular
cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1
(ICAM-1) induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) has been measured
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in cultured human brain microvessel
endothelial cells. Both the mb and the s forms of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were
upregulated by TNF-alpha; however, the stimulation of the s forms was delayed
in time. When piracetam, a neuroprotective drug, was added to the tissue
culture medium simultaneously with TNF-alpha, the expression of mbVCAM-1 and
ICAM-1 was lowered. Differential upregulation of mb and s forms of adhesion
molecules and a novel effect of piracetam have been demonstrated in human brain
microvessel endothelial cell cultures. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.<p>

ABSTRACT:  PURPOSE: In normal aging persons, oxygen and glucose consumption
progressively decreases with reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF), which could be
responsible for age-related changes in cognitive functions. A data processing
model with the use of Tc-99m SPECT of the human brain has been developed and
found to be sensitive for monitoring the effects of drugs that increase CBF. In
this study, the effect of two vasodilator drugs (the combination of
pentifylline and nicotinic acid versus piracetam) was compared with the effect
of placebo on CBF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty elderly volunteers had three
different procedures using the Peelproc method to spatially standardize and
compare CBF patterns by SPECT before and after drug intervention. The 30
patients were divided into five groups of six persons each who were randomly
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the treatment sequences consisting of three phases:
the combination of pentifylline and nicotinic acid (C), piracetam (N), and
placebo (P), or C-N-P; P-N-C; P-C-N; N-C-P; C-P-N; or N-P-C. Phases 1 to 3 each
consisted of a baseline recording of parameters (day 0), treatment for 60 days
(days 1 to 60), and recording of parameters after treatment (day 61). RESULTS:
In elderly human volunteers (ages, 52 to 70 years), after 2 months of oral
treatment with a combination of pentifylline and nicotinic acid (800 mg
pentifylline, 200 mg nicotinic acid daily), SPECT results for the Peel-proc
program indicated a statistically significant improvement in CBF of the total
brain, with a more pronounced improvement in the cerebellum and frontal
regions, where a definite shift from abnormal to normal blood flow was
detected. Spontaneous communication from most of the volunteers suggested that
they experienced an improvement in memory and general well-being from the
combination treatment. After 2 months of oral treatment with piracetam (2.4 g
daily) in elderly human volunteers, SPECT results indicated a regional
improvement in CBF, particularly in the cerebellum. However, no beneficial
effects with this drug were spontaneously reported. CONCLUSION: The in vivo
method to quantitatively monitor the progress of long-term drug therapy on CBF
described here could be useful to assess and even direct changes in therapy.<p>

ABSTRACT:  High-molecular-weight heparin-piracetam complex (1:1 w/w ratio) was
obtained in vitro. The complex, its components, or physiological solution were
introduced intraperitoneally in rats (0.3 ml, 0.1%). Piracetam had no effect on
homeostasis. The heparin-piracetam complex had a more pronounced anticoagulant
and fibrinolytic activities than the individual components. In addition, this
complex accelerated blood flow in the brain. In conditions of acute hypoxia (a
12,000-m altitude chamber), heparin protected animals from hypoxia more
effectively than other substances.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We investigated the action of piracetam on human polymorphonuclear
leukocyte (PMN) responsiveness in vitro. We first studied phosphoinositide
metabolism and calcium release with and without fMLP
(formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine) stimulation. Piracetam at
concentrations from 10(-4) to 10(-2) M induced a slight increase in inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) release and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
(PIP2) breakdown. At concentrations above 10(-3) M, piracetam sensitized PMNs
to subsequent stimulation by fMLP used at subliminal concentrations (10(-9) and
10(-8) M), inducing a significant increase in IP3 release and PIP2 breakdown
similar to that obtained with cells stimulated by the highest effective
concentrations of fMLP (10(-7) and 10(-6) M). In the same way, piracetam
greatly enhanced calcium release induced by weak concentrations of fMLP.
However, piracetam had no effect on oxidative metabolism. We then studied the
binding of (3H)fMLP to the PMN membrane in the presence of various
concentrations of piracetam. We were not able to demonstrate an obvious action
of piracetam either on receptor recruitment or on receptor affinity to fMLP.
The difference between the actions of piracetam on phosphoinositide metabolism
and calcium release on the one hand and oxidative burst on the other could be
explained by an uncoupling of the triggering and activating effects of
piracetam on PMNs. The enhancement by piracetam of intracellular cyclic AMP
levels rapidly induced termination of the PMN response and accounted for the
lack of effect on superoxide production. Thus, piracetam was able to modulate
human PMN reactivity and in particular to exert a "priming effect" (rather due
to structural modifications of the membrane), which might be of importance in
infectious episodes given the absence of deleterious actions such as oxygen
free radical production leading to tissue injury.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The effect of hypokinesia on the blood electrolyte balance was
studied. In restricted motor activity marked deviations of the type of
hypokalemia and hypercalcemia were encountered, which could promote the
development of various pathological processes, including disorder of central
and regional hemodynamics. GABA and piracetam had no effect on the blood serum
electrolyte content in the early periods of hypokinesia. In later periods of
hypokinesia both drugs under examination corrected the disorders of blood
electrolyte balance induced by prolonged restriction of motor activity.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In 1994, a standardized dry extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves (SeGb),
has been approved by German health authorities for the treatment of primary
degenerative dementia and vascular dementia. More than 24 different brands of
Ginkgo biloba extract are sold in the United States. Tacrine, also known as
tetrahydroaminoacrine (THA), and donepezil are currently the only drugs
approved in the United States for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Previous studies demonstrated that SeGb and tacrine induce significant
pharmacological effects on the brains of young, healthy human males, as
determined by bioelectrical activity measurements obtained using the
quantitative pharmaco-electroencephalogram (QPEEG) method. The type of central
nervous system (CNS) effects we have seen on computer-analyzed EEGs (CEEGs)
after administration of tacrine or EGb suggests both are "cognitive activators"
which are, as a class of products, characterized by a (prepost) relative
increase of 7.5 to 13 Hz ("alpha") and decrease of 1.3 to 7.5 Hz ("delta" and
"theta") activity. To determine whether EGb or tacrine had noticeable
pharmacological effects on elderly subjects diagnosed with possible or probable
Alzheimer's, the present open, uncontrolled trial was conducted. Data from 18
subjects (11 males, 7 females) at an average age of 67.4 years with light to
moderate dementia (Mini Mental mean score = 23.7, ranges: 15-29 [Geriatric
Depression Scale mean scores = 3.7; range: 3.2-5.4]) were analyzed for this
presentation. Each subject was randomly administered a single oral "Test-Dose"
of either 40 mg of tacrine or 240 mg of EGb2 in two separate sessions within 3-
to 7-day intervals. Before drug administration and at 1- and 3-hour intervals
after drug administration, CEEGs were recorded for a minimum of 10 minutes. The
CEEGs were analyzed using Period Analysis programs we developed for QPEEG. The
results indicated that both EGb and, to a lesser degree, tacrine induced
pharmacological effects, as established by QPEEG measurements, in the CNS
similar to those previously established in healthy, young subjects. The type of
CNS effects produced by EGb (as established by HZI's CEEG psychotropic drug
database) in elderly dementia patients were similar to those induced by tacrine
responders as well as those seen after the administration of other "cognitive
activators" (pramiracetam, vinpocetine, BMY-21502, suloctidil, and lisuride)
and anti-dementia drugs approved in the United States or Europe (tacrine,
donepezil, nimodipine, piracetam, and oxiracetam) from our database. The
results also showed that 240 mg of EGb has typical cognitive activator CEEG
profiles (responders) in more subjects (8 of 18) than 40 mg tacrine (3 of 18
subjects). Because of the small sample size, we could not test the hypothesis
that subjects who showed cognitive activator-type pharmacological response to
the first Test-Dose of EGb or tacrine also exhibit more therapeutic effects
(compared to nonresponders) when drugs are administered chronically.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Male Wistar rats were trained, in two-lever operant chambers, to
press one lever (L5) after the presentation of a conditioned stimulus (a light)
for 5 s (CS5) or the other lever (L20) after a conditioned stimulus for 20 s
(CS20). Various drugs were administered before experimental sessions, during
which CS5, CS20 and a stimulus of the intermediate duration of 12 s (CS12) were
randomly presented. Rats pretreated with vehicle made approximately 50% of
presses on L5 after the presentation of CS12. Atropine, diazepam, desipramine,
clomipramine and moderate doses of haloperidol or of scopolamine increased the
percentage of responses made on L5 after the presentation of CS20 and/or CS12.
These effects could be due to a reduction of the speed of an internal clock.
High doses of either haloperidol or scopolamine decreased the percentage of
correct responses, an effect that was interpreted as a disruption of temporal
discrimination. Nicotine and d-amphetamine decreased the percentage of
responses made on L5 after the presentation of CS5 and/or CS12, an effect that
could reflect an acceleration in the speed of the internal clock.
Physostigmine, buspirone, mianserin and piracetam did not consistently alter
performance, suggesting that these drugs do not affect timing processes.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Systemic pharmacologic treatments may be indicated in conditions in
which the distribution of muscle overactivity is diffuse. Antispastic drugs act
in the CNS either by suppression of excitation (glutamate) enhancement of
inhibition (GABA, glycine), or a combination of the two. Only four drugs are
currently approved by the US FDA as antispactic agents: baclofen, diazepam,
dantrolene sodium, and tizanidine. However, there are a number of other drugs
available with proven antispastic action. This chapter reviews the
pharmacology, physiology of action, dosage, and results from controlled
clinical trials on side effects, efficacy, and indications for 21 drugs in
several categories. Categories reviewed include agents acting through the
GABAergic system (baclofen, benzodiazepines, piracetam, progabide); drugs
affecting ion flux (dantrolene sodium, lamotrigine, riluzole; drugs acting on
monoamines (tizanidine, clonidine, thymoxamine, beta blockers, and
cyproheptadine); drugs acting on excitatory amino acids (orphenadrine citrate);
cannabinoids; inhibitory neuromediators; and other miscellaneous agents. The
technique, advantages and limitations of intrathecal administration of
baclofen, morphine, and midazolam are reviewed. Two consistent limitations
appear throughout the controlled studies reviewed: the lack of quantitative and
sensitive functional assessment and the lack of comparative trials between
different agents. In the majority of trials in which meaningful functional
assessment was included, the study drug failed to improve function, even though
the antispastic action was significant. Placebo-controlled trials of virtually
all major centrally acting antispastic agents have shown that sedation,
reduction of global performance, and muscle weakness are frequent side effects.
It appears preferable to use centrally acting drugs such as baclofen,
tizanidine, and diazepam in spasticity of spinal origin (spinal cord injury and
multiple sclerosis), whereas dantrolene sodium, due to its primarily peripheral
mechanism of action, may be preferable in spasticity of cerebral origin (stroke
and traumatic brain injury) where sensitivity to sedating effects is generally
higher. Intrathecal administration of antispastic drugs has been used mainly in
cases of muscle overactivity occurring primarily in the lower limbs in
nonambulatory, severely disabled patients but new indications may emerge in
spasticity of cerebral origin. Intrathecal therapy is an invasive procedure
involving long-term implantation of a foreign device, and the potential
disadvantages must be weighed against the level of disability in each patient
and the resistance to other forms of antispastic therapy. In all forms of
treatment of muscle overactivity, one must distinguish between two different
goals of therapy: improvement of active function and improvement of hygiene and
comfort. The risk of global performance reduction associated with general or
regional administration of antispastic drugs may be more acceptable when the
primary goal of therapy is hygiene and comfort than when active function is a
priority.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Piracetam is believed to restore the metabolism of glucose and 02,
and also to prevent the vasospasm of small arteries in the penumbra of
ischaemic focus. Taking the above into account we tried to estimate its effect
in elderly patients with stroke. The studied group consisted of 47 patients,
aged 60-78 years (mean 67,4 yrs), with the first ischaemic episode. 23 patients
were treated with 500 ml of Dextran 40 daily and 60 ml of placebo given
separately. The rest of the patients was treated with the same dose of Dextran
40 and 12 g of Piracetam as 60 ml i.v. bolus. The neurological status of the
patients was estimated using Scandinavian Neurological Stroke Scale (SNSS). In
the patients treated with Dextran and placebo there were no changes in the
total score of SNSS, both after 10 and 28 days, comparing with the initial
status. In the patients treated with Dextran and Piracetam total SNSS score
improved significantly after 10 days (p &lt; 0.05) and the effect was increased
after 28 days (p &lt; 0.02). The effect of the treatment with Piracetam was
especially accentuated in the patients with aphasia (n = 13), whose status
showed the most powerful improvement both after 10 (p &lt; 0.03) and 28 days (p
&lt; 0.02). The author believes that Piracetam instituted within the first
hours after stroke might improve the neurological status of the patients,
especially those with aphasia.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Propriospinal myoclonus is a subtype of spinal myoclonus
characterized by axial flexion or extension jerks, arrhythmic and prolonged
muscle bursts with a pattern of activation consistent with a slow conduction
within the propriospinal pathways. We describe a new idiopathic case of flexion
propriospinal myoclonus occurring upon relaxation and drowsiness. This syndrome
is to be added to the spectrum of movement disorders occurring during
drowsiness.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Young male rats, trained in a spatial three-choice test, showed
improved task acquisition after chronic treatment with piracetam (250 mg
kg(-1)). After reaching a learning criterion, one group of animals was observed
during Pavlovian extinction of the task skill and another group was assigned to
reversal learning. The rate of extinction was slowed down in piracetam treated
specimens compared to control animals. During reversal training, a new choice
had to be learned while the previously acquired choice was no longer
reinforced. Acquisition of the new skill was significantly impeded by piracetam
in contrast to acquisition of the first skill, which was facilitated. Also
during reversal learning, the piracetam treated group persevered longer than
the control group in repeating the first acquired choice at the expense of
learning the new choice. It is therefore suggested, that the impediment of
reversal learning was caused by inhibition of extinction. In an open-field
test, the time spent exploring in motion was increased by piracetam while the
velocity of locomotion was unaffected by the drug. In a novelty test, piracetam
increased the rate of loss of interactions with the novel object.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The protective and adverse effect potentials of levetiracetam
((S)-alpha-ethyl-2-oxo-pyrrolidine acetamide) in rodent models of seizures and
epilepsy were compared with the profile of several currently prescribed and
newly developed antiepileptic drugs. Levetiracetam was devoid of anticonvulsant
activity in the acute maximal electroshock seizure test and in the maximal
pentylenetetrazol seizure test in mice (up to 540 mg/kg, i.p.) but exhibited
potent protection against generalised epileptic seizures in electrically and
pentylenetetrazol-kindled mice (ED50 values = 7 and 36 mg/kg, respectively,
i.p.). This differs markedly from established and most new antiepileptic drugs
which induce significant protection in both the acute seizure tests and the
kindling models. Furthermore, levetiracetam was devoid of anticonvulsant
activity in several maximal chemoconvulsive seizure tests although an
interesting exception was the potent protection observed against secondarily
generalised activity from focal seizures induced by pilocarpine in mice (ED50
value = 7 mg/kg, i.p.), pilocarpine and kainic acid in rats (minimum active
dose = 17 and 54 mg/kg, respectively, i.p.). The protection afforded by
levetiracetam on the threshold for
methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM)-induced
seizures persisted after chronic administration (17-170 mg/kg, i.p., twice
daily/14 days) and levetiracetam did not lower the seizure threshold for the
proconvulsant action of the inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonist,
N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG 7142). The main metabolite of
levetiracetam (ucb L057; (S)-alpha-ethyl-2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetic acid) was
found to be inactive in sound-sensitive mice after acute administration of
doses up to 548 mg/kg, i.p. Levetiracetam induced only minor behavioural
alterations in both normal and amygdala-kindled rats (54-1700 mg/kg, i.p.)
resulting in an unusually high safety margin between rotarod impairment and
seizure suppression of 148 in corneally kindled mice and 235 in Genetic Absence
Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg. In comparison, existing antiepileptic drugs have
ratios between 2 and 17 in the corneally kindled mouse model. These studies
reveal a unique profile of levetiracetam in rodent models. Characteristics are
a general lack of anticonvulsant activity against maximal, acute seizures and
selective protection with a very high safety margin in genetic and kindled
animals and against chemoconvulsants producing partial epileptic seizures. This
activity differs markedly from that of the established and newly introduced
antiepileptic drugs and appears to derive from the parent compound since its
major metabolite was inactive in all models studied. Together these results
therefore suggest that levetiracetam may offer an effective, broad-spectrum
treatment of epileptic seizures in patients, with a minimum of adverse
effects.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Sudden and brief involuntary movements of central nervous system
(CNS) origin called myoclonus may be cortical (motor strip), thalamocortical
(thalamocortical loop) or reticular (caudal reticular formation). Epileptic,
cortical and thalamocortical myoclonus are combined with a spike which, when it
is focal, needs back-averaging to be demonstrated. Negative myoclonus due to
lapse of tone can only be demonstrated during antigravidic posture and may be
combined with either a slow wave or the second, positive component of a
polyspike-wave. Epileptic myoclonus must be distinguished from epileptic spasms
and tonic seizures, and from non-epileptic myoclonus, tics, tremor and chorea.
Myoclonus may occur in partial symptomatic (mainly Rasmussen and dysplasia),
cryptogenic (frontal) or idiopathic (negative myoclonus in CSWS) epilepsy.
Generalized myoclonus is part of inborn errors of metabolism, non-progressive
encephalopathy (mainly Angelman) and idiopathic epilepsy (juvenile and
infantile benign and severe forms, and myoclonic-astatic epilepsy).
Carbamazepine, vigabatrin and eventually lamotrigine may worsen myoclonus
whereas it may be improved by benzodiazepines, valproate, lamotrigine,
zonisamide and piracetam according to etiology. Pathophysiology must take in
account maturation processes, lesions and genetic predisposition. However,
precise mechanisms remain unknown and only hypotheses can be proposed, that
could clarify the age-related EEG and clinical expression of the various
syndromes.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We investigated the effects of piracetam, a nootropic, on learning
and memory formation for a passive avoidance task in day-old chicks. To test
for the possible cognitive-enhancing properties of piracetam, a weak learning
version of this task--whereby chicks maintain a memory to avoid pecking at a
bead coated in a diluted aversant for up to 10 h--was used. Post-training (5,
30 or 60 min), but not pretraining, injections of piracetam (10 or 50 mg/kg,
i.p.) increased recall for the task when the chicks were tested 24 h later.
Because previous studies showed that long-term memory for the passive avoidance
task is dependent upon a brain corticosteroid action, and because the efficacy
of piracetam-like compounds is also modulated by corticosteroids, we tested
whether the facilitating effect of piracetam was dependent upon a
corticosteroid action through specific brain receptors (mineralocorticoid
receptor and glucocorticoid receptor). First, increased plasma levels of
corticosterone were found 5 min after piracetam injection. In addition,
intracerebral administration of antagonists for each receptor type (RU28318,
for mineralocorticoid receptors, and RU38486 for glucocorticoid receptors;
i.c.) given before the nootropic inhibited the facilitative effect of piracetam
on memory consolidation. These results give further support to a modulatory
action of piracetam on the mechanisms involved in long-term memory formation
through a neural action that, in this learning model, requires the activation
of the two types of intracellular corticosteroid receptors.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Within a general cerebral deficit model--inspiratory hypoxia-the
dose--effect relationship of idebenone (CAS 58186-27-9), an antioxidant, was
studied with regard to selected electrophysiological and psychometric
parameters. Seventeen healthy male volunteers (mean age = 32 years, mean BW =
75 kg) received three different oral medications: placebo, idebenone and
piracetam (CAS 7491-74-9) as reference. The test drug idebenone was
administered in five different dosages, ranging--in 60 mg steps--from 60 to 300
mg t.id. Piracetam was given at a dose level of 800 mg t.i.d. A strict
dose-regimen was used in idebenone for safety reasons. Each
dosage/medication--except idebenone 300 mg t.i.d.--was given for one week
without washouts in between. On each 7th treatment day, pharmacodynamic
assessments comprising electroretinography (ERG), auditory evoked potentials
(AEP) and visual analogue scales (VAS) were run. Immediately after the phases
with the lower dosages, the study was continued with the highest dosage of
idebenone (300 mg t.i.d.) for a period of four weeks with pharmacodynamic
assessments on the 7th, 14th and 28th day. In this pilot study, the target
variable, the amplitude of the ERG b-wave indicated a definite antihypoxidotic
effect after the highest dosage of idebenone. With 300 mg idebenone t.i.d., ERG
b-wave amplitudes increased linearily with increasing duration of treatment.
The 'central' AEP P2-amplitude demonstrated a different dose-effect
relationship. AEP P2-amplitudes increased with increasing dosages of idebenone.
The prolongation of treatment with 300 mg t.i.d. resulted in no further
improvement of this parameter (ceiling effect). Subjective ratings (VAS) by the
volunteers confirmed the results seen in electrophysiological variables. The
findings, however, remain to be confirmed within an adequate double-blind,
crossover study design.<p>

ABSTRACT:  For 30 min the behaviour of 164 male cockroaches was studied in an
"open field" analog. At the 31st min the electrical light was switched on and
the examination was continued for 10 min. It was found out that the insects
placed in the "open field" and subjected to a sudden illumination behaved in a
similar way. After the initial freezing a sharp increase in the motor activity
was observed with subsequent habituation. Per os administration of 200-400
mg/kg of piracetam (a solution of 5 mg of the drug and 500 mg of honey in 5 ml
of water) did not change the freezing period but accelerated habituation and
decreased the locomotion augmentation caused by the light. The obtained data
suggest that piracetam improves memory and non-associative learning and exerts
a stress-protective effect on cockroaches.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A craniocerebral trauma was modelled in experiments on one-month-old
rats. Oxidative phosphorylation in the brain mitochondria was studied by
polarography 1, 4, 7 days and 4 weeks after the trauma. In the posttraumatic
period the animals received piracetam (1 g/kg), picamilon (500 mg/kg),
pyriditol (100 mg/kg), pantogam (160 mg/kg), ACTH (5-10) (0.1 mg/kg), nooglutyl
(25 mg/kg), and GVS (0.5 mg/kg). It was found that piracetam, picamilon, and
nooglutyl have a protective effect on the function of the brain mitochondria
during the course of a craniocerebral trauma. Nooglutyl surpasses all the other
drugs in its influence on the effectiveness of oxidative phosphorylation of
mitochondria in immature rats in the posttraumatic period.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The effect of p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HBA) on cycloheximide
(CXM)-induced impairment in the step-through passive avoidance task was
investigated in rats and compared to the effect of the nootropic piracetam. HBA
and piracetam significantly counteracted the CXM-induced shortening of
retention latencies. The effect of HBA was a bell-shaped dose-response curve
with a maximal effect of 5 mg/kg. The counteractive effect of HBA was not
depressed by either scopolamine or mecamylamine. The serotonin (5-HT) releaser,
p-chloroamphetamine, and presursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan, significantly
antagonized the counteractive effect of HBA on the CXM-induced shortening of
retention latencies. Furthermore, the counteractive effect was also inhibited
by the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin
(8-OH-DPAT) and the 5-HT2 receptor agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2
aminopropane [(+/-)-DOI], but potentiated by the 5-HT1 receptor antagonist
(+/-)-pindolol and the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ritanserin. There results
suggest that the beneficial effect of HBA on CXM-induced impairment is
amplified by treatment with serotonergic receptor antagonists but reduced by
serotonergic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptor agonists, and insensitive to cholinergic
manipulations.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Long-term alcohol abuse can lead to numerous central nervous system
lesions, among them central pontine myelinolysis. In this paper, the first in
Polish literature case of central pontine myelinolysis in an alcohol dependent
male, clinically diagnosed, and confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance with
one year follow-up has been presented. The patient, 49 years old, was admitted
to Addiction Treatment Unit, Department of Psychiatry in Bydgoszcz. After
admission he manifested clouded consciousness, dysphasia, hyponatremia and
neuropsychological abnormalities which showed brain stem lesion. He had no
significant abnormalities in CT. Nuclear magnetic resonance revealed triangular
hypointensive lesion 10 x 5 mm in central pontine region. One year after
admission to Addiction Treatment Unit he still has troubles with walking and
swallowing. He has bilateral pyramidal symptoms and emotional lability. He was
treated with vinpocetine (0.075 g per day), piracetam (4.8 g per day) and
chlorprotixen (0.09 g per day). He was admitted to Psychiatric Ward because of
a suicidal attempt as a manifestation of mood disorder due to general medical
condition.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A total of 620 patients with acute myocardial infarction were
followed up in order to assess the efficacy of antihypoxants as a component of
intensive care. 385 of these patients, divided into groups of 20-40 subjects,
were administered one of 12 antihypoxants or sessions of hyperbaric oxygenation
during the acute period of the disease, the rest were treated traditionally.
Analysis of clinical, laboratory, and prognostic values showed the highest
protective effect of amtizol, lithium hydroxybutyrate, piracetam, and
ubiquinone. Cytochrome C, riboxine, mildronate, and olifen were somewhat less
active, and solcoseryl, bemitil, trimethasidine, and aspisol were the least
effective. The protective potentialities of standard sessions of hyperbaric
oxygenation were virtually null. The author proposes a parameter D, reflecting
the difference between actual and predicted mortality, and the rating (score)
system for assessing the routine laboratory diagnostic tests to be used
together with the known criteria for evaluation of the protective effects of
antihypoxants in patients with acute myocardial infarction.<p>

ABSTRACT:  INTRODUCTION: Common childhood headaches seldom require prophylactic
treatment which, nevertheless, is quite often unsatisfactory. OBJECTIVE: To
study drug and non-drug related factors that may influence the therapeutic
response. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A four-month follow-up study of all patients
attended during a year at the neuropediatric, outpatient hospital-based clinic,
with &gt; or = 2 monthly migraine without aura attacks, &gt; or = 10
tension-type headaches, or both types of headaches. Patients were randomized to
be treated on an open basis, placebo controlled, with flunarizine or piracetam.
Headache frequency was evaluated according to treatment and patients' basal
characteristics. RESULTS: 98 patients studied (56 migraine without aura, 24
tension-type headache, 18 mixed). 33% dropped out; they were school
underachievers more frequently than those that completed the protocol. Of those
completing the protocol and treated with placebo as the first choice of
therapy, 27% reported total remission of symptomatology; those not remitting
with placebo were high achievers at school significatively more frequently. At
the end of the trial, 43% of the initially randomized patients still complained
of headaches, regardless of treatment, showing a seasonal relationship.
CONCLUSIONS: Prophylaxis of benign childhood headaches is needed in less than
half of those reporting a high headache frequency; school achievement should be
taken into consideration as another clue to compliance and headache
persistence. On a short-term basis only the seasonal influence and the placebo
effect can be held responsible for amelioration of symptomatology.<p>

ABSTRACT:  1. The influence of acute and chronic treatment with piracetam on
spatial working memory of rats was examined. A new version of an operant
chamber "delayed match-to-position task" was used, in which the animals had to
visit one randomly baited box out of three boxes ("choice boxes") in a front
panel. Hereafter a delay period began, in which the subjects had to visit an
alcove in the back panel ("reference box"). At the end of the delay the animals
should return to the front panel and choose the same choice box that was baited
before the delay, thereby obtaining a reward. 2. Rats were trained to a stable
level of performance, measured as per cent correct responses during sessions of
20 trials. Additionally, the time spent between leaving the choice box and
entering the reference box was recorded. Results were obtained from a single
group of rats tested repeatedly under different experimental conditions. 3.
Injections of scopolamine (0.6 mg/kg) significantly reduced the percentage of
correct choices and increased the time spent to reach the reference box. The
impairment of correct choices was reversed after chronic treatment with
piracetam (250 mg/kg). However, the same treatment did not reverse the effect
of scopolamine on the time performance. 4. Scopolamine also induced an increase
of repetitive errors (a measure of perseverance), and the chronic treatment
with piracetam caused full reversal of this increase. These results represent
the first observation of a piracetam induced reversal of scopolamine
impairments in a working memory test. 5. In normal animals not treated with
scopolamine, acute injection of piracetam had no effect compared to saline
injected controls, but chronic treatment with the nootropic significantly
enhanced working memory performance. The drug did not affect the time used to
reach the reference box.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A number of previously unidentified 1H NMR signals detected in CSF
spectra of patients with various neurological and metabolic diseases are
assigned to metabolites, drugs and drug excipients. Two-dimensional 1H NMR
spectroscopy (COSY and J-resolved) is employed to resolve resonances which are
hidden by superimposed peaks in one-dimensional spectra. Assignments obtained
by making use of 2-D techniques, and of a 1-D 1H NMR data base created for ca.
150 authentic compounds, enable us to clarify the nature of complex signal
patterns found in crowded spectral regions of CSF such as the aliphatic methyl
region at ca. 1.0 ppm.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Rett syndrome (RS) is one of the most frequent causes of mental
retardation in females. As there are no known biochemical, genetic, or
morphological markers, diagnosis is based on clinical phenotype including
severe dementia, autism, truncal ataxia/apraxia, loss of purposeful hand
movements, breathing abnormalities, stereotypies, seizures, and extrapyramidal
signs. Myoclonus, although reported in some series, has never been
characterized. We studied 10 RS patients, age 3 to 20 years, and observed
myoclonus in 9. Severity of myoclonus did not correlate with that of the other
symptoms or with age. Multifocal, arrhythmic, and asynchronous jerks mainly
involved distal limbs. Electromyographic bursts lasted 48 +/- 12 msec.
Burst-locked electroencephalographic averaging generated a contralateral
centroparietal premyoclonus transient preceding the burst by 34 +/- 7.2 msec.
Motor evoked potentials showed normal latencies, indicating integrity of the
corticospinal pathway. Somatosensory evoked potentials were enlarged. The
C-reflex was hyperexcitable and markedly prolonged (62 +/- 4.3 msec), mainly
due to increase in cortical relay time (28.4 +/- 4.5 msec). We conclude that RS

ABSTRACT:  OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of
three daily dosage regimens of oral piracetam in patients with progressive
myoclonus epilepsy. METHODS: Twenty patients (12 men, eight women), aged 17-43
years, with classical Unverricht-Lundborg disease were enrolled in a
multicentre, randomised, double blind trial of crossover design in which the
effects of daily doses of 9.6 g, 16.8 g, and 24 g piracetam, given in two
divided doses, were compared with placebo. The crossover design was such that
patients received placebo and two of the three dosage regimens of piracetam,
each for two weeks, for a total treatment period of six weeks and thus without
wash out between each treatment phase. The primary outcome measure was a sum
score representing the adjusted total of the ratings of six components of a
myoclonus rating scale in which stimulus sensitivity, motor impairment,
functional disability, handwriting, and global assessments by investigators and
patients were scored. Sequential clinical assessments were made by the same
neurologist in the same environment at the same time of day. RESULTS: Treatment
with 24 g/day piracetam produced significant and clinically relevant
improvement in the primary outcome measure of mean sum score (p=0.005) and in
the means of its subtests of motor impairment (p=0.02), functional disability
(p=0.003), and in global assessments by both investigator (p=0.002) and patient
(p=0.01). Significant improvement in functional disability was also found with
daily doses of 9.6 g and 16.8 g. The dose-effect relation was linear and
significant. More patients showed clinically relevant improvement with the
highest dosage and, in individual patients, increasing the dose improved
response. Piracetam was well tolerated and adverse effects were few, mild, and
transient. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence that piracetam is
an effective and safe medication in patients with Unverricht-Lundborg disease.
In addition, it shows that a dose of 24 g is highly beneficial, more effective
than lower doses and that a dose-effect relation exists. There is considerable
variation in optimal individual dosage.<p>

ABSTRACT:  To evaluate the efficacy of piracetam therapy, 76 children with
breath-holding spells admitted to the Outpatient Clinic of Dicle University
Medical Faculty Paediatrics Department and Bakirkoy State Hospital, Paediatrics
Department between 1988 and 1990 and 1991 and 1996, respectively, were included
in this placebo-controlled trial. Diagnosis of breath-holding spells was made
for all cases by medical history, pediatric physical examination,
electroencephalogram, and laboratory findings. Placebo or piracetam as
suspension was administered to patients on a randomized basis; piracetam was
administered to children in suspension 40 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses for a
period of 2 months. Of the 76 children enrolled, 39 received piracetam and 37
received placebo. Overall, control of breath-holding spells was observed in
92.3% of the patients in the group taking piracetam as compared with 29.7% in
the group taking placebo (P &lt; .05). No differences between the 2 groups in
adverse events or side effects were observed. Complete blood count, biochemical
profile, and urine analysis taken before and after treatment revealed no change
from beginning to end and no difference between the 2 groups. It is suggested
that piracetam is a safe and effective drug, with an incidence of side effects
no different from that of placebo, for the treatment of breath-holding
spells.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Intravenous administration of piracetam to hamsters reduced the
formation of a platelet-rich venous thrombus induced by a standardised crush
injury, in a dose-dependent fashion with an IC50 of 68 +/- 8 mg/kg. 200 mg/kg
piracetam also significantly reduced in vivo thrombus formation in rats.
However, in vitro aggregation of rat platelets was only inhibited with
piracetam-concentrations at least 10-fold higher than plasma concentrations
(6.2 +/- 1.1 mM) obtained in the treated animals. No effects were seen on
clotting tests. In vitro human platelet aggregation, induced by a variety of
agonists, was inhibited by piracetam, with IC50's of 25-60 mM. The broad
inhibition spectrum could be explained by the capacity of piracetam to prevent
fibrinogen binding to activated human platelets. Ex vivo aggregations and
bleeding times were only minimally affected after administration of 400 mg/kg
piracetam i.v. to healthy male volunteers, resulting in peak plasma levels of
5.8 +/- 0.3 mM. A possible antiplatelet effect of piracetam could be due to the
documented beneficial effect on red blood cell deformability leading to a
putative reduction of ADP release by damaged erythrocytes. However similarly
high concentrations were needed to prevent stirring-induced "spontaneous"
platelet aggregation in human whole blood. It is concluded that the observed
antithrombotic action of piracetam cannot satisfactorily be explained by an
isolated direct effect on platelets. An additional influence of piracetam on
the rheology of the circulating blood and/or on the vessel wall itself must
therefore be taken into consideration.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We have previously shown that the novel anticonvulsant levetiracetam
exerts potent anticonvulsant activity against both focal and secondarily
generalized seizures in fully amygdala-kindled rats, i.e. , a model of temporal
lobe epilepsy. We examined whether levetiracetam also exhibits
antiepileptogenic activity, i.e., prevents or retards acquisition or
development of amygdala-kindling in rats. Before the experiments with chronic
administration of levetiracetam at different doses, we determined the
pharmacokinetics of the drug after i.p. injection. Levetiracetam had a
relatively short half-life (about 2-3 hr) in rats, so that any lasting effects
of the drug after chronic administration were certainly not due to drug
accumulation. When rats were treated with levetiracetam during kindling
acquisition at daily i.p. doses of 13, 27 or 54 mg/kg, the drug
dose-dependently suppressed the increase in seizure severity and duration
induced by repeated amygdala stimulation. After termination of daily treatment
with 54 mg/kg, duration of behavioral seizures and of afterdischarges recorded
from the amygdala remained to be significantly shorter compared to vehicle
controls, although amygdala stimulations were continued in the absence of drug.
These data thus indicate that levetiracetam not simply masked the expression of
kindled seizures through an anticonvulsant action, but exerted a true
antiepileptogenic effect. Adverse effects were not observed at any dose of
levetiracetam tested in kindled rats. The powerful antiepileptogenic activity
of levetiracetam in the kindling model indicates that levetiracetam is not only
an interesting novel drug for symptomatic treatment of epilepsy but might be
suited for pharmacological prevention of this disease in patients with a high
prospective risk of the development of epilepsy.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The effects of the administration of metoclopramide, cisapride and
SR-17 on memory processes were evaluated in the mouse passive avoidance test.
The administration of dicyclomine (0.1-3 mg kg-1 i.p.), immediately after
termination of the training session, produced a dose-dependent amnesic effect.
Metoclopramide (1-5 mg kg-1 i.p.), cisapride (0.5-2 mg kg-1 i.p.) and SR-17
(1-10 mg kg-1 i.p.), administered 20 min before the training session, prevented
dicyclomine-induced amnesia. In the same experimental conditions piracetam (30
mg kg-1 i.p.), physostigmine (0.2 mg kg-1 i.p.) and CGP 35348 (100 mg kg-1
i.p.) prevented dicyclomine amnesia. At the highest effective doses, none of
the drugs impaired motor coordination, as revealed by the rota-rod test, nor
did they modify spontaneous motility, as revealed by the Animex test. These
results suggest that metoclopramide, cisapride and SR-17 play an important role
in the modulation of memory processes. On these bases, these compounds could be
useful in the treatment of cognitive deficits.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The increase of interest in piracetam in the treatment of stroke has
been noticed lately. The reason of that is the unique double-action of this
drug which depends on: 1. its effect on vascular system, and 2. improving of
the metabolic process in a nerve cell. The purpose of our work was the
evaluation of the therapeutic action of piracetam in comparison with other
drugs, which are applied in treating stroke. 171 patients were examined, and
piracetam was given to 40 of them. The effects of the treatment were evaluated
after 14 days of using piracetam in dose of 12.0 g i.v. The authors estimate,
that this drug is efficient in ischaemic stroke. However, its definite
superiority over other drugs has not been firmly stated.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The effect of the nootropic drug piracetam (100 mg/kg) on kindled
seizures, kindling-induced learning deficits, and histological alterations due
to changes in central excitability was investigated in Wistar rats. The animals
were kindled by repeated i.p. injections of an initially subconvulsive dose of
pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). As a control, piracetam or physiological saline was
given 60 minutes before PTZ. Twenty-four hours after completion of kindling the
rats were tested in a shuttle-box paradigm. Seven days after the final kindling
injection, the animals received a challenge dose of PTZ. Finally, the brains of
the rats were processed for histological investigation.
Pentylenetetrazol-kindled animals showed increasing seizure scores, and a
learning deficit in the shuttle-box. Piracetam had no effect either on kindling
development or on the reaction to a challenge dose of PTZ, but it protected the
animals against the kindling-induced reduction of learning performance. The
substance had no effect on learning performance in control animals. In distinct
hippocampal structures, a neuronal cell loss was found in kindled rats.
Interestingly, piracetam counteracted this damage efficaciously. The effects of
piracetam are discussed in terms of its cytoprotective action. It is suggested
that a coadministration of piracetam with clinically used antiepileptic drugs
might be useful in antiepileptic therapy.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Experiments on rats showed that the morpho-functional state of the
cerebral cortex microcirculatory bed suffers marked changes in different
periods of hypokinesia. This was accompanied with obvious morphological changes
in the brain, the development of brain edema in particular. It was found that
the GABAergic agents which we used ranked below Ca-antagonists in antiedemic
activity.<p>

extraerythrocytic hemoglobin in blood serum. The dipeptide nootropic agent

particularly 60 min before immobilization reduced the accumulation of these
products of lipid peroxidation in the brain and blood. GVS-111 demonstrated
these signs of its antioxidant effect after a single i.p. injection in doses of
0.12 and 0.5 mg/kg. Pyracetam produced a similar effect on the listed
parameters in injection in a dose of 300 mg/kg for three successive days. The
protective effect of the new pyracetam dipeptide analog GVS-111 in relation to
activation of free-radical processes induced by immobilization is additional
proof of the antistress action of this dipeptide.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The effects of two cognition enhancers on avoidance impairment
induced by the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline were assessed during
shuttle-box avoidance acquisition and in previously trained mice of the DBA/2
strain. The nootropic agent piracetam (50, 100 or 200 mg/kg, i.p.) had slight
or no effect in mice receiving amitriptyline (5 or 10 mg/kg, i.p.). Conversely,
the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor tacrine (0.5, 1, 2 or 3 mg/kg, i.p.)
prevented the avoidance impairment induced by 5 mg/kg amitriptyline on
shuttle-box avoidance acquisition as well as on a previously learned avoidance
response. The avoidance disrupting action produced by 10 mg/kg of the
antidepressant drug was not affected by the anticholinesterase drug. The
preventing action of tacrine seems specifically related to the avoidance
impairment induced by amitriptyline, since the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor
did not reduce, but enhanced the avoidance impairing action of the neuroleptic
chlorpromazine. Taken together, the results indicate that amitriptyline-induced
avoidance impairment, and the related preventing action of tacrine, may be
ascribed to drug effects on the performance of the avoidance response, rather
than to interferences with learning processes.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The primary objective of this study was to investigate the economic
impact of treatment of acute ischaemic stroke with piracetam vs placebo
according to the societal perspective in France. Socio-demographic, clinical
and resource utilisation data for piracetam and placebo patients during the
acute phase following stroke was obtained from the Piracetam Acute Stroke Study
(PASS) clinical trial database. The economic analysis was based on the
population defined as being treated within 6 h 59 min following stroke and
presenting an initial Orgogozo score of less than 55. Resource utilisation data
concerning the rehabilitation phase, outpatient follow-up and
institutionalisation was obtained from decision tree analysis. There was a
higher percentage of autonomous patients in the piracetam group (27.8%)
compared to placebo (22.9%). The mean duration of hospitalisation (autonomous
21.8 days; non-autonomous 30.3 days) and the cost of an autonomous patient was
lower than a non-autonomous patient. The total cost per stroke patient
receiving piracetam was estimated at 103 KF during the 6-month period, compared
to 106 KF per placebo patient. The major cost driver was hospitalisation during
the acute phase, representing approximately 50% of the total cost per patient.
In patients with moderate to severe stroke treated within 6.59 h, piracetam was
cost-effective compared to placebo over the 6-month study period.<p>

ABSTRACT:  1. Extracellular recording of field potentials, evoked by
commissural stimulation in hippocampal area CA3 of anaesthetized rats, was
performed in order to study the mode of action of the novel antiepileptic drug
levetiracetam (ucb LO59). 2. The amplitude of orthodromic field population
spike (PS2) markedly increased and repetitive population spikes appeared when
the recording micropipette contained either bicuculline methiodide (BMI), or
the specific GABAA antagonist gabazine (SR-95531). 3. BMI-induced increases in
PS2 were reduced in a dose-dependent manner by 1 to 320 mumol kg-1
levetiracetam i.v., with a U-shape dose-response relationship. However,
levetiracetam did not reduce the increases in PS2 produced by gabazine. 4.
Clonazepam (1 mg kg-1, i.p.), carbamazepine (20 mg kg-1, i.p.) and valproate
(200 mg kg-1, i.v.) were ineffective in preventing BMI-induced increases in
PS2, while the calcium channel antagonist flunarizine, 50 mumol kg-1, i.p.,
reduced PS2 increments caused by BMI. The L-type calcium channel blocker
nifedipine, 100 mumol kg-1, i.p., was without effect. Similar to levetiracetam,
flunarizine did not reduce the increases in PS2 induced by gabazine. 5. These
data suggest that the increased excitability of CA3 neurones, caused by BMI
administered in situ, involves calcium-dependent processes not associated with
blockade of GABAA receptors. The inhibition by levetiracetam of this
calcium-dependent effect of BMI might contribute to the antiepileptic effects
of the drug.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A membrane stabilizing effect of endobronchial laser therapy and
antioxidative drugs piracetam and solcoseril was studied in 83 patients with
chronic bronchitis. Malonic dialdehyde was measured to evaluate effects of this
treatment on cellular and humoral immunity, blood coagulation and lipid
peroxidation. It was found that the addition of membrane stabilizers to
standard therapy of chronic bronchitis lowered malonic dialdehyde
concentrations while the addition of the stabilizers and endobronchial laser
therapy relieved clinical symptoms earlier, improved parameters of immunity,
hemostasis and lipid peroxidation.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Previous behavioural and electrophysiological studies have indicated
that levetiracetam (ucb LO59) acts as an anticonvulsant drug in vivo. The
purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of levetiracetam on
normal synaptic transmission and epileptiform activity in vitro. Intracellular
recordings were obtained from the CA3 subfield of the rat hippocampal slice
preparation. Levetiracetam in a concentration of 10 microM did not influence
basic cell properties or normal synaptic transmission evoked by subthreshold
and suprathreshold stimuli to the commissural pathway. However, it strongly
inhibited the development of epileptiform bursting by the gamma-aminobutyric
acid (GABA)A-receptor antagonist bicuculline (1-30 microM). Levetiracetam also
decreased the size of bursts previously established by bicuculline. In
experiments in which the glutamate-receptor agonist N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA)
was used to generate spontaneous bursting, levetiracetam had no effect on the
size of the bursts but decreased bursting frequency. The difference in effects
of levetiracetam on bicuculline- and NMDA-induced bursting appeared to be
dependent on the convulsant used, since in the presence of 10 microM
bicuculline, levetiracetam decreased the size of NMDA-bursts to the same extent
as the size of synaptically evoked bicuculline-bursts but had little effect on
bursting frequency. The results show that under our experimental conditions,
levetiracetam did not alter the components of normal synaptic transmission.
However, levetiracetam at the concentrations studied inhibited epileptiform
bursting induced by bicuculline and NMDA in vitro in a manner consistent with
the profile of an antiepileptogenic drug.<p>

ABSTRACT:  For the purpose of rational modification of the TRH molecule, we
were pursuing an approach that consists of two steps: (1) 'obligatory'
replacement of histidine with glutamine in TRH and (2) the application of
conformational constraints for putative bioactive conformation I stabilized by
an intramolecular hydrogen bond between C-terminal carboxamide proton and
alpha-carbonyl of histidyl (glutaminyl), and conformation II formed by an
intramolecular hydrogen bond between alpha-carbonyl of pyroglutamyl and
prolinamide proton. Significant antiamnesic potency was discovered in the
passive avoidance test (ECS and Scopolamine induced amnesia) for conformation
II mimic (8S,10aS)-8-carbamoyl-1,2,3,6,7,8,9,10a-
octahydro-5H,10H-pyrrolo[1,2-a][1,4]diazocin-5,10-dione (2) at doses of 0.1 and
1.0 mg/kg. EEG analysis indicates a mild activating effect of compound 2 on
EEG, which is similar to that of piracetam and differs from hard amphetamine
activation. Conformation I mimic
3-(2-carbamoylethyl)-2,3,6,7,8,8a-hexahydro-1H,4H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]
pyrazin-1,4-dione (1) exhibited an antidepressant effect at a dose of 1 mg/kg.
The transition from two putative quasi-cyclic bioactive conformations of TRH
and its obligatory similar analogue [Gln2]-TRH to their cyclic mimics led to
differentiation of antiamnesic and antidepressant activity of TRH.<p>

ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Piracetam, a nootropic agent with
neuroprotective properties, has been reported in pilot studies to increase
compromised regional cerebral blood flow in patients with acute stroke and,
given soon after onset, to improve clinical outcome. We performed a
multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial to test whether piracetam conferred
benefit when given within 12 hours of the onset of acute ischemic stroke to a
large group of patients. METHODS: Patients received placebo or 12 g piracetam
as an initial intravenous bolus, 12 g daily for 4 weeks and 4.8 g daily for 8
weeks. The primary end point was neurologic outcome after 4 weeks as assessed
by the Orgogozo scale. Functional status at 12 weeks as measured by the Barthel
Index was the major secondary outcome. CT scan was performed within 24 hours of
the onset of stroke but not necessarily before treatment. Analyses based on the
intention to treat were performed in all randomized patients (n = 927) and in
an "early treatment" population specified in the protocol as treatment within 6
hours of the onset of stroke but subsequently redefined as less than 7 hours
after onset (n = 452). RESULTS: In the total population, outcome was similar
with both treatments (the mean Orgogozo scale after 4 weeks: piracetam 57.7,
placebo 57.6; the mean Barthel Index after 12 weeks: piracetam 55.8, placebo
53.1). Mortality at 12 weeks was 23.9% (111/464) in the piracetam group and
19.2% (89/463) in the placebo group (relative risk 1.24, 95% confidence
interval, 0.97 to 1.59; P = .15). Deaths were fewer in the piracetam group in
those patients in the intention-to-treat population admitted with primary
hemorrhagic stroke. Post hoc analyses in the early treatment subgroup showed
differences favoring piracetam relative to placebo in mean Orgogozo scale
scores after 4 weeks (piracetam 60.4, placebo 54.9; P = .07) and Barthel Index
scores at 12 weeks (piracetam 58.6, placebo 49.4; P = .02). Additional analyses
within this subgroup, confined to 360 patients with moderate and severe stroke
(initial Orgogozo scale score &lt; 55), showed significant improvement on
piracetam in both outcomes (P &lt; .02). CONCLUSIONS: Piracetam did not
influence outcome when given within 12 hours of the onset of acute ischemic
stroke. Post hoc analyses suggest that piracetam may confer benefit when given
within 7 hours of onset, particularly in patients with stroke of moderate and
severe degree. A randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, the
Piracetam Acute Stroke Study II (PASS II) will soon begin.<p>

ABSTRACT:  47 patients with acute ischemic stroke were treated with nootropil
(pyracetam, UCB, Belgium) from the first day of the disease (12 g,
intravenously, by drops during 2 weeks, then 4.8 g, per os) on the background
of basic therapy. There was revealed increase of spontaneous activity,
expressive and impulsive speech, audio- and speaking memory (especially delayed
memory), tactile, acoustic and visual gnosis, space praxis. There was observed
more pronounced positive dynamics of functions of damaged hemisphere in
patients with localisation of ischemic focus in left hemisphere. Meanwhile
restoration was slower when ischemic focus was localized in right hemisphere.
Restoration of high mental functions occurred to be faster during nootropil
treatment as compared with basic therapy only. The conclusion was made that
nootropil can be prescribed for the patients with hemispheric ischemic stroke
and especially for the patients with alterations of cerebral circulation in
system of internal carotid artery including such disturbances on the background
of insufficiency of circulation in vertebrobasilar system.<p>

ABSTRACT:  54 patients were treated by notropil (pyracetam). The results of
therapy were evaluated statistically according to a number of clinical scales
and neurophysiologic indices (EEG and evoked potentials with mapping of
bioelectric activity). The results were compared with the data about 56
patients of the control group which were treated by traditional method without
application of notropil. Notropil was applied by two ways: small doses (4-12 g
daily) during 5 days or high doses (10-12 g daily) during 30 days from the
moment when the patient admitted to the hospital. Intravenous injections of the
drug were used in all cases as well as its internal administration. It was
showed either efficiency of the drug, especially in high doses, in early
beginning of the treatment and its duration for at least 30 days or good
tolerance of the drug. Authors supposed that application of pyracetam is not
adequate in strokes with severe disorders of consciousness and cerebral
edema.<p>

ABSTRACT:  OBJECTIVES: To assess the combination of drug and cognitive therapy
on age-associated memory impairment (AAMI). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A
double-blind randomized trial was performed involving 162 patients with
age-associated memory impairment selected and followed by their general
practitioners. Two intervention methods-a drug and a cognitive therapy-were
assessed in combination. Three randomized parallel groups of 54 patients each,
aged 55 years and over, were followed and treated for 3 months. After a placebo
washout period of 10 days, one group received 2.4 g of piracetam, another
group, 4.8 g and the third, a placebo. RESULTS: A total of 135 patients, 45 in
each group, completed the study. Combined therapy was most effective in
patients whose baseline performance on memory tests was lowest. The best
results were observed with piracetam combined with memory training. This result
confirmed by the global impression of the principal investigator was in
agreement with findings of previous double-blind placebo-controlled trials
assessing the combined effect of drug treatment and memory training.
CONCLUSION: This result confirmed by the global impression of the principal

ABSTRACT:  The metabolism of a new piracetam analogue, the dipeptide cognitive
enhancer N-phenylacetyl-L-prolylglycine ethyl ester (GVS-111) was studied in
vivo. GVS-111 itself was not found in rat brain 1 h after 5 mg/kg i.p.
administration up to limit of detection (LOD) under high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) conditions. Three substances corresponding to the three
possible GVS-111 metabolites, namely phenylacetic acid, prolylglycine and
cyclo-prolylglycine, were found in experimental rat brain samples as well as in
controls using HPLC, gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (GC-MS) methods. Only cyclo-prolylglycine concentration increased
(2.5-fold) 1 h after GVS-111 administration. Cyclo-prolylglycine formation from
GVS-111 in the presence of plasma and brain enzymes was shown in vitro. These
data could be considered as evidence that GVS-111 is prodrug which converts in
the body to cyclo-prolylglycine, and which is identical to the endogenous
cyclopeptide that produces the nootropic activity.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We have demonstrated that, in the rat hippocampal formation,
withdrawal from chronic alcohol consumption aggravates the ethanol-induced loss
of pyramidal neurons and dentate granule cells. We have also shown that
intracerebral grafting and piracetam could have a protective effect in these
conditions. In this study we utilized immunocytochemical methods to investigate
whether gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic dentate gyrus cells, which are
known to be inhibitory, were also affected by withdrawal from alcohol and, if
so, whether putative neuroprotective agents could ameliorate the alterations
found. Rats were alcohol-fed for 6 months and further divided into several
groups: (1) alcohol-fed for an extra 6 months; (2) withdrawn from alcohol for 6
months; (3) withdrawn and grafted with newborn rat hippocampal tissue; (4)
withdrawn and orally treated with piracetam for 6 months; (5) withdrawn and
treated systemically with monosialoganglioside GM1 for 6 months; (6) withdrawn
and treated with the vehicle used to dissolve the GM1. Control animals were
pair-fed. All animals were killed 12 months after the beginning of the
experiment and processed for GABA immunocytochemistry. GABA-immunoreactive (IR)
neurons in the dentate gyrus were quantified and we found that alcohol-fed
animals had a significant reduction in the numerical profile density of GABA-IR
neurons in the dentate gyrus as a whole and in the hilus and in the granular
layer of the suprapyramidal limb. Withdrawal from alcohol aggravated the
GABAergic neuronal loss. Of the treatments used, only piracetam had a striking
beneficial effect. Data gathered from the present work and from our previous
studies indicate that the neuronal loss following chronic alcohol consumption
and withdrawal affects both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the dentate
gyrus and that piracetam may have a useful protective role in this condition.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A capillary electrophoresis (CE) procedure has been developed for
the determination of piracetam in human plasma. Analyses were performed on an
uncoated silica capillary using borax buffer modified with the addition of
alpha-cyclodextrin. The detection was UV, operated at 200 nm. The detection
limit of the authentic samples was 1 microg/ml. The calibration curve was
linear over a range of 4 to 24 microg/ml (r=0.997). Inter-assay R.S.D. was
below 9.3%. The described method has been successfully applied to the
quantitative determination of piracetam in human plasma and should be useful
for clinical and bioavailability investigations.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Levetiracetam is a novel antiepileptic agent with a wide spectrum of
activity against experimental and clinical seizures. The mechanism of its
anticonvulsant action remains to be determined. We have investigated the
effects of levetiracetam on several gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-related
neurochemical parameters in mouse brain. Adult male mice were randomised into
two groups and administered levetiracetam (0-300 mg/kg) intraperitoneally
either as a single dose or twice daily for 5 days. Four hours after the final
dose, animals were killed and their brains removed. Brain tissues were analysed
for concentrations of GABA, glutamate and glutamine and for the activities of
GABA-transaminase and glutamic acid decarboxylase. Single dose and repeated
levetiracetam treatments were without effect on all of the parameters
investigated. The anticonvulsant action of levetiracetam is unlikely to be
mediated via an action on the GABAergic system.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Mydocalm and nootropil combination was used for treatment of
antibiotic neurosensory hypoacusia (24 patients) and non-antibiotic hypoacusis
(11 patients). 100 mg of mydocalm was diluted in 10.0 ml of 0.9% sodium
chloride and injected intravenously. 20% solution of nootropil (5.0 ml) was
injected intramuscularly. The 14-day course produced subjective response. Noise
in the ears and heavy head feeling disappeared. As shown by measurements of
auditory thresholds, improvement of hearing was only subjective. The responses
were similar in both groups of patients.<p>

ABSTRACT:  It was established that propranolol in a daily dose of 2 mg/kg
causes disturbance of behavior of rats with arterial hypertension in the open
field, deteriorates retention of memory traces in passive avoidance paradigm,
and leads to the development of depression in the test for zoosocial
interrelation. Administration of nootropic piracetam (200 kg/mg/24 h). as well
as the original compounds ACP-94 (20 mg/kg/24 h) and PIR-87--6-0 (50-mg/kg/24
h) facilitates the correction of negative changes in the behavior and memory of
hypertensive rats.<p>

ABSTRACT:  1. With the use of the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp method,
three types of voltage-activated ionic currents were examined in isolated
neurons of the snail Helix pomatia: high-threshold Ca2+ current (ICa),
high-threshold Ca(2+)-dependent K+ current (IK(Ca)) and high-threshold K+
current independent of Ca2+ (IK(V)). 2. The effect of bath application of the
nootropics piracetam and a novel piracetam peptide analog, ethyl ester of
N-phenyl-acetyl-L-prolyl-glycine (GVS-111), on these three types of
voltage-activated ionic currents was studied. 3. In more than half of the
tested cells, ICa was resistant to both piracetam and GVS-111. In the rest of
the cells, ICa decreased 19 +/- 7% with 2 mM of piracetam and 39 +/- 14% with 2
microM of GVS-111. 4. IK(V) in almost all cells tested was resistant to
piracetam at concentrations up to 2 mM. However, IK(V) in two-thirds of the
cells was sensitive to GVS-111, being suppressed 49 +/- 18% with 1 microM
GVS-111. 5. IK(Ca) appeared to be the most sensitive current of those studied
to both piracetam and GVS-111. Piracetam at 1 mM and GVS-111 at 0.1 microM
decreased the amplitude of IK(Ca) in most of the cells examined by 49 +/- 19%
and 69 +/- 24%, respectively. 6. The results suggest that piracetam and GVS-111
suppression of voltage-activated calcium and potassium currents of the neuronal
membrane may regulate (both up and down) Ca2+ influx into neurons.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Pathogenesis of poisoning with hydrazine seems complicated.
Hydrazines inhibit pyridoxal-dependent enzymes, interfere with carbohydrates
transformation and lipid metabolism, alter the processes of energy metabolism.
Treatment of poisoning with hydrazine is effective only when containing drug
combinations. Based experimentally, recommendations on the combination
(phenazepam, be methyl, piracetam, ionol) were supported by chemical testing of
the drugs.<p>

ABSTRACT:  After oral doses of piracetam this drug is detectable in serum as
well as in urine after formation of the red Fe(III)-hydroxamatecomplex by
thin-layer densitometry. Detection in serum requires extraction with a mixture
of dichloromethane/ methanol, while urine can be used directly after dilution.
The limit of quantification in urine is 100 micrograms/ml and in serum 4.0
micrograms/ml. The new method was validated by HPLC. The coefficient of
correlation was 0.9999% for determination in urine and 0.9986% for
determination in serum.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Thymectomized rats, 5 weeks after surgery, showed a significant
impairment in learning and memory as shown by deficits in passive avoidance and
in the Morris water maze test. The behaviour of the thymectomized rats in the
"open field" apparatus was largely unchanged. Following treatment for 20 days
with either piracetam (500 mg/kg) or tacrine (3.0 mg/kg), the deficit in
passive avoidance learning was largely reversed. Chronic treatment with tacrine
also reversed the deficit in the behaviour of the thymectomized rats in the
Morris water maze. The effects of thymectomy on the biogenic amines and some of
their metabolites in the amygdaloid cortex, hypothalamus, striatum and
olfactory bulbs were also determined. Relative to the sham-operated controls,
thymectomy resulted in a reduction in the noradrenaline concentration in the
amygdala, hypothalamus, and olfactory bulbs. This effect was reversed by
chronic piracetam and tacrine treatments. The concentration of dopamine was
also reduced in the olfactory bulbs after thymectomy whereas in the striatum
the concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) was increased. The
concentration of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) was determined in amygdaloid
cortex and hippocampus only. The only significant change occurred following
chronic treatment of thymectomized rats with tacrine, when a significant
elevation of GABA was found. Neither piracetam nor tacrine produced any change
in the amines of their metabolites in the sham-operated controls. Tacrine,
however, elevated the dopamine and reduced the 5-HT content of the hypothalamus
and increased the 3,4-dihydroxylphenylacetic acid concentration of the striatum
of thymectomized rats. Examination of the differential white blood cell count
of the thymectomized rats showed that the percentage of lymphocytes was
decreased, and the percentage of neutrophils increased, relative to the
sham-operated controls. Chronic lacrine, but not piracetam, treatment reversed
the lesion-induced changes.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Gastrodin (GAS) and p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HBA) which is an
aglycone of gastrodin, are active ingredients of Gastrodia elata Blume. In this
study, we attempted to investigate the effects of acute administration of GAS
and HBA on learning and memory processes such as acquisition, consolidation and
retrieval, on the passive avoidance task in rats; piracetam was used as a
positive control. Scopolamine, impairing learning acquisition, shortened the
step-through latency in the retention test in rats. GAS and HBA did not prolong
the step-through latency induced by scopolamine in the passive avoidance task,
but piracetam could prolong the step-through latency induced by scopolamine.
Cycloheximide, impairing memory consolidation, shortened the step-through
latency in the retention test in rats. GAS at 50 mg/kg, HBA at 5 mg/kg and
piracetam at 100 mg/kg could prolong the step-through latency induced by
cycloheximide in the passive avoidance task. Apomorphine, impairing memory
retrieval, shortened the step-through latency in the retention test in rats.
GAS at 5 mg/kg, HBA at 1 mg/kg and piracetam at 300 mg/kg could prolong the
step-through latency induced by apomorphine in the passive avoidance task. From
the above results, we concluded that the facilitating effects of HBA on
learning and memory are better than those of GAS. In conclusion, GAS and HBA
can improve cycloheximide- and apomorphine-induced amnesia, but not
scopolamine-induced acquisition impairment in rats. Thus, GAS and HBA can
facilitate memory consolidation and retrieval, but not acquisition. The
facilitating effects of GAS and HBA are different from those of piracetam.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The pharmacokinetics of a new nootropic dipeptide analog of
piracetam-N-phenylacetyl-L-prolylglycine (GWS-111) and its main metabolites
were studied in rats by means of high performance liquid chromatography and
gas-liquid chromatography. The compound under study showed a greater resistance
to an enzymatic effect than natural neuropeptides. In addition to an unchanged
compound three of its metabolites were found in the blood plasma of the rats.
One of them, cyclo-Pro-Gly was an active metabolite of GWS-111.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Vestibular symptoms frequently occur in patients with migraine
headache. The common migraine is defined in neurology as a unilateral,
pulsating headache, which may be associated with nausea and vomiting, and lasts
one or several days. In the classic form patients have visual prodromal
symptoms. Focal neurological signs in the migraine complique include, for
example, oculomotor palsy and vestibular abnormalities. This so-called
vestibular migraine is different from basilar migraine, which involves the
irritation of the cervical sympathetic system, and can cause symptoms that
resemble transient brainstem ischemia. In order to evaluate vestibular
dysfunction electronystagmography (ENG) was used. Patients frequently had
abnormal caloric test responses, especially with a directional preponderance,
and most had a spontaneous nystagmus. In the migraine attack the patients are
presumed to have hypersensitivity of the labyrinth with nausea and vomiting,
while in the headache-free period the ENG was almost normal. At present, we
have had a high success rate in treating patients with pyracetam. Diazepam was
used to treat basilar migraine and flunarizine to prevent vestibular
migraine.<p>

ABSTRACT:  OBJECTIVE: To determine whether piracetam 4.8 g/day together with
intensive language therapy improved language function more than language
therapy alone. DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study.
SETTING: Referral speech and language clinic of a university department of
neurology. PATIENTS: Sixty-six inpatients with aphasia present between 4 weeks
and 36 months. INTERVENTIONS: Intensive language therapy for 6 weeks in all
patients. Thirty-two patients received piracetam 4.8 g daily and 34 patients
received placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The Aachen Aphasia Test (AAT), a
standardized procedure for evaluating the severity of aphasia, was performed at
baseline and after 6 weeks' treatment. RESULTS: In 50 patients evaluated for
efficacy, a trend toward improvement in the active group was observed in all
subtests of the AAT. This trend was statistically significant for absolute
differences in recovery of "written language" and "profile level." CONCLUSION:
Piracetam appears to have a positive adjuvant effect on the recovery of aphasia
in patients receiving intensive language therapy.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The effects of MCI-225, a novel psychoactive compound, and reference
drugs on attention behavior were studied using visual stimulus induced vertical
eye tracking movements in midpontine pretrigeminal (PTG) feline preparation.
Surgery was performed under ether anesthesia and subsequently switched to
nitrous oxide-fluothane which was discontinued only during experimental
sessions. In addition xylocaine was locally injected. Vertical eye movements
were monitored by electrooculogram (EOG) and a TV camera. To compare the
effects of drugs on eye movement, numbers of spontaneous and tracking eye
movements exceeding a present amplitude in EOG were counted before and during
the visual stimulation, respectively. MCI-225 (1 and 3 mg/kg, i.v.) enhanced
tracking movements dose-dependently without an increase in spontaneous eye
movements. No or little change of the electrocorticogram (ECoG) was seen with 1
mg/kg MCI-225 and a slight increase in low voltage fast pattern was observed
with 3 mg/kg, i.v.. On the other hand, tacrine (0.3 mg/kg, i.v.), physostigmine
(0.03 mg/kg, i.v.) and methylphenidate (0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) enhanced both types of
eye movement and induced ECoG arousal. Desipramine (3 mg/kg, i.v.) slightly
increased spontaneous eye movement without affecting tracking movements.
Piracetam (100 mg/kg, i.v.) decreased spontaneous eye movements only. These
data clearly show that MCI-225 enhances attention to a moving object and
suggest that MCI-225 could be useful in the treatment of attentional deficits
and related cognitive dysfunctions in psychiatric disorders.<p>

ABSTRACT:  From January 1993 to December 1994, 9 patients (median age 40 years,
range 29-71) were evaluated for sudden hearing loss at the Valme de Sevilla
University Hospital, Spain. All had severe or profound initial hearing loss,
which was bilateral in 3 (33%) cases. Total deafness affected 5 (41%) ears. All
subjects were treated with a 3-day course of intravenous piracetam, 10 g/day
diluted in 250 ml of saline solution and administered in a 15-minute
intravenous infusion. No side effects occurred. The parameters examined were
age, sex, side of lesion, contralateral hearing status, time from onset of
symptoms to admission, vestibular symptoms, tinnitus, erythrocyte sedimentation
rate, initial hearing loss, and audiogram configuration. After treatment, 6
(50%) ears showed improved hearing. Eight (89%) patients had vestibular
symptoms, and 5 (55%) reported tinnitus.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Potentiating ability of piracetam and tocopherol acetate was studied
outpatiently in aged patients with ischemic heart disease. It was found that
the addition of piracetam and tocopherol acetate to conventional antianginal
drug therapy brings higher response and exercise tolerance, contributes to more
effective hemodynamic and energetic support of the exercise, to positive
changes in the central and peripheral hemodynamics.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In vitro preincubation of brain membranes of aged mice with
piracetam (0.1-1.0 mmol/L) enhanced membrane fluidity, as indicated by
decreased anisotropy of the membrane-bound fluorescence probe
1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH). Piracetam had similar in vitro effects on
brain membranes of aged rats and humans, but it did not alter brain membrane
fluidity in young mice. Chronic treatment of young and aged rats with piracetam
(300 mg/kg once daily) significantly increased membrane fluidity in some brain
regions of the aged animals, but had no measurable effect on membrane fluidity
in the young rats. The same treatment significantly improved active avoidance
learning in the aged rats only. It is suggested that some of the
pharmacological properties of piracetam can be explained by its effects on
membrane fluidity.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The Third Eilat Conference on New Antiepileptic Drugs was held at
the Royal Beach Hotel from May 27 to May 30, 1996. Epileptologists and
scientists from 20 countries attended the conference, which was held to discuss
critical issues in drug development, new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in
development, progress reports and recent findings of newly marketed AEDs, the
use of AEDs in special populations and their utilization in non-epileptic
disorders. Over the last seven years, six new AEDs have been introduced
worldwide and new information on their safety and efficacy has become
available. These include felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine,
topiramate and vigabatrin. Drugs in development include those at an advanced
stage, such as remacemide and tiagabine, as well as those just entering
clinical trials, such as rufinamide (CGP 331010) and levetiracetam (ucb LO59).
The following is a summary of the presentations for drugs in development and
recent findings on newly marketed drugs.<p>

ABSTRACT:  We studied the evolution of the purity and other characteristics of
heroin seized in 17 Spanish provinces (especially seizures presumed to be
street drugs) and explored their relation with the prevalence and recent
changes in intravenous use. We found great variability in purity within and
between provinces: in provinces with large cities the purity is similar to or
greater than that detected elsewhere in Europe, in others it is less than 30
percent, and on the island of Mallorca it is over 60 percent. Purity has
increased in recent years. The heroin in circulation is predominantly brown in
all of Spain except on the Mediterranean coast. The principal adulterants
detected are caffeine, paracetamol and piracetam; phenobarbital and procaine
have disappeared. In provinces where white heroin is in circulation, most
heroin users in treatment use the intravenous route; in provinces where brown
heroin predominates, the proportion of chasers increases with increasing purity
of heroin (correlation coefficient = 0.6). The disappearance of white heroin
has paralleled the spread of the phenomenon of chasing.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Previous studies of cognition enhancers have mainly focused on
insufficiently defined groups of cognition disorders, e.g., "cerebral
insufficiency". With regard to the various biological changes in senile
dementia of Alzheimer's type (SDAT) and in vascular dementia (VD), which
together make up the great majority of senile dementias, many authors have
encouraged different studies of these types of dementias, especially since both
can be diagnosed clinically with satisfying certainty. Since primary care
physicians treat the majority of elderly and demented patients, they have their
own experience with cognition enhancers. We were therefore interested to know,
how far these physicians differ in their treatment of SDAT and VD. We performed
a representative survey (response rate 83.2%; 145 family physicians and 14
neuropsychiatrists) in the Goettingen area. A written case vignette described a
70-year-old widow with moderate dementia and vascular risk factors which are
easily treated with drugs. Two versions were randomly assigned, in which
(version A) either a "typical" VD history or a typical SDAT history (version B)
were described. After perusal, the physician was asked whether and which drugs
he would choose to treat the cognitive disorders in this patient. Most
frequently, piracetam (A/B: 25.6%/30.9%), ginkgo biloba (24.4%/28.4%), and
nimodipine (14.1%/25.9%) were considered. Aspirin was cited by 29.5%(A) and
17.3%(B) of the physicians respectively. As far as the type of dementia was
concerned, significant differences were found only for co-dergocrine, which was
preferred in SDAT. The following inter-group trends were observed: family
physicians considered ginkgo biloba more often than nimodipine or
co-dergocrine. The results show the apparent importance of cost-and safety
aspects, while the type of dementia has hardly any impact. The latter
impression corresponds to the results of drug trials demonstrating no different
efficacy. In our opinion, aspirin was not sufficiently taken into
consideration.<p>

ABSTRACT:  According to the latest research the therapy of dementia includes
following strategies: Above all there is a necessity for thoroughly diagnostic
tests to exclude diseases which secondary induce reduced brain function. The
early onset of non pharmacological treatments e.g. "brain-jogging" is
essential. Pharmacological therapy with nootropics (e.g. Codergocrin,
Nicergolin, Ginkgo biloba, Piracetam, Pyritinol, Naftidrofuryl) is recommended
as early as possible, because they have no relevant side effects. Calcium
antagonists may also be administered because of their neuroprotective
properties. One pharmacological approach to enhance cholinergic functions
involves inhibiting ACH-degradation by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase.
Although this relatively new therapy has benefits, in some patients it has not
been effective and has a potential to cause serious adverse (hepatic) events;
only mild to medium severe dementias of Alzheimer's disease should be treated
with this therapeutic principle. In the case of personality disorders there are
psychotherapy and the administration of psychoactive drugs necessary.<p>

ABSTRACT:  This review is meant to serve several purposes. First, it surveys
the preclinical and clinical profiles of piracetam-like nootropics. Second, the
conditions under which the nootropics are active in preclinical studies are
identified and analyzed with a view of finding a common denominator that could
explain the observed effects. Third, the clinical profile is examined, on the
one hand to assess whether these drugs are in fact active in humans, and on the
other to determine how the clinical effects of the nootropics compare with
those of tacrine. Lastly, the clinical data are then further scrutinized to
assess whether they fulfill the expectations based on the preclinical
findings.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Levetiracetam ((S)-alpha-2-oxo-pyrrolidine acetamide, ucb L059) is a
novel anticonvulsant drug presently in clinical development. Its mechanism of
action is unknown although a recently novel specific binding site for
[3H]levetiracetam, unique to brain, may be involved. This binding site has yet
been characterized, but some evidence suggested a possibly indirect interaction
with the GABA system. We therefore examined levetiracetam's effects on GABA
metabolism and turnover in several rat brain regions after systemic
administration of anticonvulsant doses. Furthermore, in order to study
functional effects of levetiracetam on a well defined system of GABAergic
neurons in a brain region that has been critically involved in anticonvulsant
drug action, we examined levetiracetam's action on spontaneous firing of
substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) neurons in anesthetized rats. Although
levetiracetam did not alter the activity of the GABA synthesizing and degrading
enzymes glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and GABA aminotransferase (GABA-T) in
vitro, systemic administration induced significant alterations in these enzymes
in several brain regions, indicating that these enzyme alterations were no
direct drug effects but a consequence of postsynaptic changes in either
GABAergic or other neurotransmitter-related systems. In the striatum,
levetriacetam, 170 mg/kg i.p., induced a significant increase in GABA-T
activity while GAD activity markedly decreased. When GABA turnover was
estimated after inhibition of GABA-T by aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), treatment
with levetiracetam (given 15 min prior to injection of AOAA) significantly
reduced GABA turnover in the striatum. Since the substantia nigra pars
reticulata (SNR) receives a strong GABAergic input from the striatum, we
examined if the alterations in GABA metabolism and turnover in the striatum led
to functional alterations in neuronal activity in the SNR by recording single
unit activity of SNR neurons after i.p. injection of levetiracetam. While
injection of vehicle did not affect SNR neuronal activity, a significant
decrease in spontaneous neuronal firing was recorded after levetiracetam. Since
a substantial body of evidence suggests that the SNR is a critical site at
which decrease of neuronal firing results in protection against various seizure
types, the suppressive effect of levetiracetam on SNR activity may contribute
to the anticonvulsant action of this drug.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In normal aging humans there is a progressive decrease of oxygen and
glucose consumption with a reduction of cerebral blood flow (CBF), which could
be responsible for age-related changes in cognitive functions. A baboon model
under anaesthesia using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of
the brain and the radiopharmaceutical hexamethylpropylene amine oxime
(99mTc-HMPAO) has been developed and found to be sensitive to the effects of
drugs that are known to increase CBF. In the present study, the effect of two
haemorrheologically active drugs, viz a combination of pentifylline (CAS
1028-33-7) and nicotinic acid (CAS 59-67-6) vs. piracetam (CAS 7491-74-9) were
compared with the known effect of acetazolamide (CAS 59-66-5) on CBF in the
baboon model using the 99mTc-HMPAO split dose method. Acetazolamide (p &lt;
0.05) and the combination of pentifylline and nicotinic acid (p &lt; 0.01)
increased the CBF when compared with the control baseline. The CBF was not
significantly increased upon treatment with piracetam, pentifylline alone and
nicotinic acid alone, when compared with the control values for total brain
ratios (p &gt; 0.05). However, an increased regional effect was observed for
piracetam. These results indicate that the above haemorrheologically active
drugs exhibit specific but different effects on cerebral blood flow with
possible clinical implications.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Prolonged alcohol intake affects the morphology of the hippocampal
formation of the rat and the resulting alterations do not reverse after
withdrawal. Actually, an increase of the degenerative activity might occur in
this condition. This unexpected observation prompted us to test the efficacy of
neuronoprotective drugs during withdrawal. Because in a previous study we found
that piracetam, a cyclic derivative of GABA, once added during withdrawal
impedes hippocampal cell loss, we decided to evaluate the effect of this
compound at the synaptic level. Using unbiased stereological techniques, we
estimated the total number of contacts between mossy fibers and CA3 pyramids,
as well as the volume and the surface area of the respective pre- and
postsynaptic compartments. We found that in piracetam-treated withdrawn rats
the number of synapses was higher than that observed in nonpiracetam-treated
and alcohol-fed animals. The mechanisms leading to the synaptic reorganization
took place at the mossy fiber level. The postsynaptic compartment does not seem
to participate in the reorganization. It is suggested that the role of
piracetam in this process might depend on the protective effect that this
compound has upon glutamatergic receptors.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Alzheimer's disease is a devastating illness that will become more
common as the population ages. Although clinical diagnosis of the illness is
not certain without histological examination of the brain, and misdiagnosis may
occur, broad working criteria to help diagnose the likely presence of
Alzheimer's disease are available. Thoughtful clinical evaluation improves
diagnostic accuracy, and appropriately diagnosed patients are critical for
involvement in research into new antidementia agents. Essential to the
discovery of new drugs is careful measurement of illness response. A variety of
scales--some aimed at patients, others at their caregivers, and yet others for
clinicians--assess Alzheimer's disease severity, progression, symptom response,
and quality of life. Of note, patient response is not the only measurement of
treatment benefit today. Growing interest is also being placed on tracking the
possible amelioration of caregiver 'burden'. This burden refers to the
psychological, physical, and material costs of providing care for an
Alzheimer's patient over long periods of time. A number of scales and
questionnaires have been developed and are occasionally used. Many drugs have
been tried in Alzheimer's disease, but very few have produced any benefit, and
this is often modest. Ergoloid mesylates, initially thought to be effective,
are now considered of little value. The cholinomimetic drugs, especially the
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor tacrine, have provided a very modest benefit,
slowing the progression of the illness for a number of months. No cognitive
improvement has been noted with the various nootropic agents such as piracetam.
Early studies with levacecarnine (acetyl-L-carnitine), a substance that
facilitates the use of fatty acids, memantidine, the dimethyl derivative of
amantidine, and the calcium channel blocker nimodipine, have shown some
promise, but require larger, more rigorous studies. As mentioned above,
documenting effects in individual patients is crucial; examining for potential
benefit to caregivers is a growing part of research design. Current treatment
efforts will become more sophisticated as a deeper understanding of the
neurobiology of Alzheimer's disease develops. For the immediate future, the
goal is not cure but slowing of the disease process. Achieving this limited
goal would have a substantial impact on the financial and human costs of the
illness.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Emotional stress was caused in rats by changing the location of the
gate in the shuttle chamber through which training had been accomplished in the
previous experiments. The procedure led to disorder of the avoidance response
(AR) and increase of intertrial responses (ITR). Phenazepam (0.1 mg/kg)
prevented increase in the number of ITS. Piracetam (300 mg/kg) reduced the
sharp growth of ISR but, in contrast to phenazepam, it provided a higher level
of AR reproduction. The ISR were greater in piracetam than in phenazepam
administration. The obtained results show that the suggested model allows the
difference in the effects of piracetam and phenazepam to be disclosed.<p>

ABSTRACT:  p-Hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HBA), an aglycone of gastrodin, is an
active ingredient of Gastrodia elata BLUME. In this study, we investigated the
action of HBA on acquisition of an inhibitory avoidance response in rats and
used piracetam as a positive control. The results indicated that scopolamine, a
cholinergic receptor antagonist, injected before training impaired retention.
HBA did not attenuate the scopolamine-induced impairment, but piracetam did.
p-Chloroamphetamine, a serotonin releaser, injected before training impaired
retention. HBA at 5 mg/kg and piracetam at 100 mg/kg could counteract the
p-chloroamphetamine-induced deficit. Apomorphine, a dopaminergic receptor
agonist, also impaired retention. HBA at 5 mg/kg and piracetam at 300 mg/kg
could ameliorate the apomorphine-induced amnesia. The above results indicated
that HBA, different from piracetam, can attenuate impairments induced by
p-chloroamphetamine and apomorphine, but had no effect on impairment induced by
scopolamine in an inhibitory avoidance task in rats. Such findings suggest that
HBA may act through suppressing dopaminergic and serotonergic activities and
thus improves learning.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Studies were carried out on the effects of piracetam (4-20 mM) on
the electrical activity of identified neurons in the isolated central nervous
system of the pond snail in conditions of single-electrode intracellular
stimulation and recording. Piracetam-induced changes were seen in 60-70% of the
neurons studied. Different parameters showed different sensitivities to
piracetam: the most frequent changes were in the action potential generation
threshold, the slope and shape of the steady-state voltage-current
characteristics of neuron membranes, and the appearance of piracetam-induced
transmembrane ion currents. Nifedipine and cadmium ions, both of which are
calcium channel blockers, generally reversed or weakened the effects of
piracetam on the changes seen in test cells. This indicates that the effects of
piracetam result from its action on calcium channels; selective changes in
calcium channels may determine which piracetam-induced effects appear at the
cellular level. It is hypothesized that the piracetam-sensitive cellular
plasticity mechanisms may make a significant contribution to its nootropic
action at the behavioral level.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The experimental antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam (UCB L059), a
piracetam analogue has been investigated in photosensitive patients in the
"photosensitivity model", an early phase II study. A total of 12 patients (10
females, 2 males) with a mean age of 21.5 years (range 13-38) were investigated
during a 3 day period in 3 centres (France, The Netherlands, Germany), using
the same standardised method. The subjects were either treated with a single
oral dose of 250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg or 1,000 mg. In addition, 4 patients took
250 mg b.i.d. for 3-5 days, after which they were re-examined. In 9 of 12
photosensitive patients (75%) a clear suppression (3 patients) or abolishment
(6 patients) of IPS evoked photoparoxysmal EEG responses was found. This effect
appeared to be dose-dependent, the higher the dose the greater the effect;
complete abolishment was only seen at dosages of 750 mg and 1,000 mg, occurring
at peak plasma levels and lasting between 6 and 30 h. There was no indication
of pharmacokinetic interaction with concomitant antiepileptic drugs such as
valproic acid, ethosuximide or phenobarbitone. No serious side-effects were
seen and some patients reported enhancement of their mood. Two patients with
myoclonic jerks noticed a clear reduction of their myoclonus, although this was
not one of the objectives of the study. In conclusion, levetiracetam showed a
clear antiepileptic effect in the photosensitivity model.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Deficit in active and inhibitory avoidance behaviour has been
pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-kindled rats. This supports the view that memory
deficit is an integral part of epilepsy. In the present study we examined the
effect of the nootropic drugs piracetam and fipexide on memory deficit induced
by PTZ-kindling in shuttle-box- and step-down-trained rats. The retention in
piracetam- and fipexide-treated animals was significantly improved compared to
the kindled controls. The mechanisms of action of the two drugs are considered.
The favourable of nootropic drugs in cases of amnesia provoked by PTZ-kindling
might be of interest in clinical practice.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Sixty patients with disabling myoclonus excluding mainly spinal
myoclonus were treated by piracetam as an open-labeled study, and myoclonus
score, neurological symptoms, functional disability, and intensity of myoclonus
were scored before and after treatment, including a blinded video inspection.
Electrophysiological correlation also was investigated before and after
treatment. Piracetam was effective in myoclonus, especially that of cortical
origin, in both monotherapy and polytherapy. Piracetam also had positive
benefits on gait ataxia and convulsions but not on dysarthria, and feeding and
hand writing improved much more significantly. Psychologically significant
improvement was seen in decreased motivation, sleep disturbance, attention
deficit, and depression, all of which might be possibly secondary benefits
associated with improvement of myoclonus. There was no positive correlation
between clinical and electrophysiological improvement. Tolerance was good, and
side effects were transient. However, hematological abnormalities observed in
at least two patients in the present study should be kept in mind when
relatively large doses of piracetam are administered, especially in combination
with other antimyoclonic drugs.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The authors' aim was to develop schemes of hypertension stage I-II
treatment in subjects exposed to nervous and emotional stress at their jobs.
These patients benefited from ambulatory monotherapy with obsidan or piracetam
(improvement in psychic status, mental and muscular performance, in memory and
attention). Reserpin worsened the patients' activity, mental performance and
cognitive functions. Combination of piracetam plus reserpin promoted positive
changes in psychic status, mental performance and amnestic function in stage
IB-II hypertension. This combination is thought effective for inpatient
treatment of hypertensive subjects exposed to psychoemotional stress.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Presently available GC and HPLC methods for analysis of piracetam,
require large samples and suffer from interference. A micro scale, isocratic
high-performance liquid-chromatographic method is described for the
determination of piracetam in plasma (25 microL) or cerebrospinal fluid (10
microL) using ultraviolet absorbance at 215 nm. The limit of quantitation is 4
micrograms mL-1 and the within-batch and between-batch coefficients of
variation are less than 10%. No interference from other commonly prescribed
antimyoclonic or antiepileptic drugs was observed and thus the method can be
used to monitor piracetam in patients on polytherapy antimyoclonic or
antiepileptic drug regimens. Because of the sensitivity and rapidity of the
method it is suitable for pharmacokinetic and mechanistic studies and for
analysis of paediatric samples.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Stress-protective effect of phosphonglycerid and acyl analogs of
neurotransmitter amino acids, which displayed nootropic activity was obtained.
These compounds exerted positive influence on behavioral failure and
morphological statement after 18-h immobilization.
Dilithium-N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid (AKF-94) and di(3-dimethoxyphosphorylpropyl)
ester of N-acetyl-DL-aspartic acid (PIR-87-6-0) displayed the most expressive
activity. Previously activating influence of these compounds at excitatory
amino acid transmission had been shown. We supposed participation of this way
in stress-protective effect of new compounds.<p>

ABSTRACT:  A hypothesis is advanced, according to which substances containing
an amino group can compete with glucose in binding with protein groups and
inhibiting in this way glycosylation. Screening in vitro experiments with
nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, piracetam, panangin, ascorbic acid, bucarban,
betanase, and adebit in a concentration of 10(-3) M were performed. Bucarban,
betanase, and adebit were found to be capable of inhibiting glycosylation.
Daily oral administration of bucarban and adebit in therapeutic doses for one
month reduced the blood fructosamine level in rats with alloxan diabetes
without changing the level of glycemia.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Effects of the pyracetam and its sodium hydroxybutyrate complex were
studied on a model of the neuropathic pain syndrome. It was demonstrated that
the pyracetam prevents the development of the neuropathic pain syndrome. The
pyracetam relieves the pain syndrome. The sodium hydroxybutyrate appears to
enhance preventive and medical effects of the pyracetam. Possible mechanisms of
action of these drugs are discussed.<p>

ABSTRACT:  1. The effect of the nootropic drug, piracetam on stress- and
subsequent morphine-induced prolactin (PRL) secretion was investigated in vivo
in male rats, by use of a stress-free blood sampling and drug administration
method by means of a permanent indwelling catheter in the right jugular vein.
2. Four doses of piracetam were tested (20, 100, 200 and 400 mg kg-1), being
given intraperitoneally 1 h before blood sampling; control rats received saline
instead. After a first blood sample, rats were subjected to immobilization
stress and received morphine, 6 mg kg-1, 90 min later. 3. Piracetam had no
effect on basal plasma PRL concentration. 4. While in the non-piracetam-treated
rats, stress produced a significant rise in plasma PRL concentration, in the
piracetam-pretreated rats PRL peaks were attenuated, especially in the group
given 100 mg kg-1 piracetam, where plasma PRL concentration was not
significantly different from basal values. The dose-response relationship
showed a U-shaped curve; the smallest dose had a minor inhibitory effect and
the highest dose had no further effect on the PRL rise. 5. In unrestrained
rats, morphine led to a significant elevation of plasma PRL concentration.
After the application of immobilization stress it lost its ability to raise
plasma PRL concentration in the control rats, but not in the piracetam-treated
rats. This tolerance was overcome by piracetam in a significant manner but with
a reversed dose-response curve; i.e. the smaller the dose of piracetam, the
higher the subsequent morphine-induced PRL peak. 6. There is no simple
explanation for the mechanism by which piracetam induces these contradictory
effects. Interference with the excitatory amino acid system, which is also
involved in opiate action, is proposed speculatively as a possible mediator of
the effects of piracetam.<p>

ABSTRACT:  During the first 24 h, a progression of the burn wound in
histological depth or extension is often noted. This can only partially be
prevented by the routinely used protocols of fluid resuscitation and burn wound
dressing. In a rat model of 5% TBSA burn, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) and
piracetam were evaluated for their ability to further prevent this early
deepening of the burn wound. After infliction of the burn wound, the animals
were treated with an accepted basic burn wound treatment consisting of mafenide
10% solution humid dressings. They were then randomized into three groups: a
control group (n = 10), receiving no other treatment, a HBOT group (n = 17),
receiving 60 min of HBOT (203 kPa) twice daily, and a piracetam group (n = 19),
receiving piracetam (200 mg/kg IM) twice daily. On the third day of treatment,
the entire burn wound was exised and examined histologically. It was found that
both HBOT and piracetam had statistically significant effects on the
preservation of epidermal basal membrane (P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.01,
respectively). HBOT, but not piracetam, further had significant effects on the
destruction of skin appendages (P &lt; or = 0.05 and P &gt; 0.05, respectively)
and on the degree of subepidermal inflammation, as measured by leucocyte
infiltration (P &lt; 0.001 and P &gt; 0.05, respectively). Furthermore, the
HBOT group showed significantly less leucocyte infiltration than the piracetam
group (P &lt; 0.01). It was concluded that, although the clinical importance of
the small effects on skin appendage and basal membrane preservation may be
questionable, the effect on subepidermal leucocyte infiltration is striking and
warrants further investigation of the anti-inflammatory effects of HBOT and
possibly piracetam.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The influence of hypokinesia on phospholipid composition of the
brain tissue was investigated. Hypokinesia was found to cause significant
disorders in the phospholipid composition. Changes exhibit a phase character
and are more pronounced on the 15-th and 30-th days of hypokinesia. The use of
GABA and pyracetam promotes the processes aimed at normalization of the
phospholipid metabolism in the brain tissue.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The low-dose effect (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) of the nootropic
drug pyracetam on some DA-ergic neurochemical parameters of the rat striatum,
as well as on the locomotion activity of rats were studied using the
"open-field" test. It was shown that pyracetam (l mM) in vitro increases the
K(+)-stimulated (28 mM) DA release from the perfused isolated striatum to 148
+/- 14 pmole/mg tissue compared to the control animals: 101 +/- 10 pmole /mg (p
&lt; 0.05, Student's t-test). Pyracetam in a dose of 100 mg/kg increased the DA
level and decreased the 5-HT level in the striatum homogenates: DA- to 121% and
5-HT-to 81% (p &lt; 0.05), respectively. The content of DOPAC, HVA and 5-HIAA
in the tissue remained the same. In addition to the mentioned effects pyracetam
promoted the locomotion activity of rats in the "open field" -putative
behavioral marker of the striatum DA-ergic function. Thus pyracetam is capable
of modifying the DA-ergic activity of the rat striatum, thus stimulating the
neuromediator release.<p>

ABSTRACT:  HPLC method has been developed for pharmacokinetic study of
nootropic peptide analog of pyracetam GVS-111 and its main metabolites. In the
model experiments on rats the enzymes of blood plasma were shown to metabolize
GVS-111 during 1-h incubation with the formation of metabolite,
phenylacetylproline. This suggests that in vivo experiments these blood plasma
enzymes will also be actively involved in the metabolism of the compound
tested. The liver tissue enzymes metabolized GVS-111 much slower.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The management of children suffering from sickle cell disease
[sickle cell anaemia (SCA) and sickle cell beta degree-thalassaemia (S beta
degree-thal.)] has been the concern of all clinicians caring for these
patients. Several agents have been tried for treatment, often limited by toxic
side effects. Piracetam (2-oxo-l-pyrrolidine acetamide, Nootropyl), a cyclic
derivative of gamma-amino butyrate, used for the treatment of psychosenescent
syndromes with no known side effects, was considered as a possible therapeutic
agent for sickle cell disease. Interest was focused on the use of piracetam
when it was shown that it had an antisickling effect, both in vivo and in
vitro. We initiated multicentre double-blind investigations in two groups of
children suffering from sickle cell disease ranging in age from 3-6 to 6-12
years. The total number of patients included in the study were 87 (SCA = 79 and
Hb S beta degree-thal. = 8) in 13 centres in 10 different regions of Saudi
Arabia. Coded boxes of the drugs were received from the company (UCB) and were
administered as intravenous infusion during crises and orally during the
follow-up, for a period of up to 1 year. After decoding the code at the end of
the study, the patients were grouped into those receiving placebo (n = 39),
i.e. controls, or piracetam (n = 48), i.e. study cases. In terms of age,
weight, height and severity index, number of blood transfusions received and
number of hospitalization, both groups were statistically homogenous. Data
analysis showed that the clinical severity of the disease, the number of
crises, the extent of hospitalization and the blood transfusion requirements
significantly decreased during piracetam treatment (p &lt; 0.001), though no
statistically significant changes occurred in the placebo group. However, in
the levels of the haematological and biochemical parameters no significant
changes were documented in both groups. In addition, the improvement in the
clinical presentation of the disease continued even several months after
discontinuation of the drug in the majority of the children, as judged from the
low severity index value. Though our results point to the recommendation that
piracetam can be used for the treatment of children suffering from sickle cell
disease, both SCA and S beta degree-thal, it is advisable to conduct long-term
and close follow-up treatment programmes using piracetam to establish its
therapeutic value particularly in adults and to ascertain that there are no
long-term toxic side effects.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In a single-trial, passive-avoidance response (PAR) paradigm, young
rats at post-natal day (PND) 16 were found to exhibit a performance deficit
that diminished progressively with age. When administered prior to training,
single peripheral injections of cholinomimetic drugs, either a muscarinic
agonist (arecoline, pilocarpine or oxotremorine), an acetylcholinesterase
inhibitor (tacrine or E2020), or nicotine, increased the response latencies for
young rats to that of adult levels in a dose-dependent manner (overall dose
range = 0.003 microgram/kg-10 mg/kg). Neither the cholinergic antagonists
scopolamine, atropine or mecamylamine, nor a series of non-cholinergic drugs,
diazepam, haloperidol, phenobarbital, pargyline, D-amphetamine, imipramine,
piracetam or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) increased PAR latencies. When 0.1
mg/kg scopolamine was given to young rats prior to arecoline, the dose-effect
curve for enhanced latency times was shifted to the right. Higher doses of
scopolamine completely blocked the effects of arecoline. Scopolamine (0.001-1.0
mg/kg) administered subsequent to, rather than before PAR training, blocked the
usual arecoline-induced enhancement of response latencies. Alternatively,
consolidation could be facilitated with different doses of tacrine (0.0003-10
mg/kg). These results demonstrate that young rats fail to remember the PAR but
that retention for this task can be specifically enhanced with cholinomimetic
drugs.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In simulating acute hypoxic hypoxia with the participation of male
volunteers, the authors investigated the antihypoxic and antioxidative activity
of metabolic drugs (jakton, amtizole succinate, nootropil, probucol, and a
mixture which consists of jakton, amtizole succinate, and probucol). The
pharmaceuticals were shown to have heterodirectional effects on lipid
peroxidative processes. Drugs having a pronounced antioxidative activity (such
as probucol and the mixture) promotes oxygen utilization during hypoxia and
posthypoxic reoxygenation chiefly by the oxygenase pathway. This rearrangement
of oxygen utilization processes caused an increase in human high-altitude
resistance. The use of the above drugs is a promising trend in the development
of an adaptative response to hypoxia in persons engaged in hazardous jobs.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Piracetam and its derivatives, a group of "nootropic" drugs thought
to act as metabolic enhancers in the brain, have been widely used to treat a
variety of cognitive disorders. Two studies have reported that this compound
reduces the severity of involuntary movements in acute onset hemichorea. We
therefore randomly assigned 11 patients with Huntington's disease to receive
high doses of intravenous piracetam (12 g in 250 ml of saline) or placebo on
different days. A blinded observer then rated the severity of involuntary
movements over a period of 4 hours. Significant aggravation (p &lt; 0.05) of
chorea was seen in patients taking piracetam, in comparison with ratings for
both baseline and placebo, 4 hours after administration but not during earlier
assessments. Although the mechanism causing this effect is unidentified, we
believe that our findings indicate that piracetam should not be used to treat
the cognitive disorders accompanying Huntington's disease.<p>

ABSTRACT:  An isocratic high performance liquid chromatographic micromethod is
described for the quantitation of levetiracetam (ucb L059) in plasma or serum
of patients. The chromatography is performed on a 250 x 4 mm I.D. LiChrospher
60 RP-select B, 5-micron column, eluted with an acetonitrile/50 mM phosphate
buffer (15:85 vol/vol, pH 5.6) mobile phase, and levetiracetam detected using
ultraviolet absorbance at 220 nm. The limit of quantitation was 5 mumol/L and
the within-batch and between-batch coefficients of variation were &lt; 7%. No
interference from commonly prescribed antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine and
its metabolite carbamazepine epoxide, ethosuximide, gabapentin, lamotrigine,
phenobarbitone, phenytoin, primidone, valproic acid, and vigabatrin) was
observed, and thus the method can be used to monitor levetiracetam in patients
on polytherapy antiepileptic drug regimens.<p>

ABSTRACT:  The effects of the nootropic drugs piracetam and aniracetam on
antinociception induced by baclofen, bicuculline, and picrotoxin and on
baclofen-induced muscle relaxation were studied in mice. Antinociception was
investigated using both the hot plate (thermal stimulus) and abdominal
constriction (chemical stimulus) tests. Both behaviour inhibition and muscle
relaxation were observed by using the rota-rod test. Piracetam (30 mg/kg, IP)
and aniracetam (10 mg/kg, PO) reduced baclofen, bicuculline, and picrotoxin
antinociception without modifying analgesia induced by non-GABAergic drugs such
as morphine, physostigmine, clomipramine, and diphenhydramine. In this
concentration range, piracetam, and aniracetam were also able to reduce the
inhibition of rota-rod performance. At higher doses piracetam (100 mg/kg, IP)
and aniracetam (100 mg/kg, PO) were able to completely prevent baclofen
antinociception. However, when prevention of GABAergic antinociception was
complete, piracetam and aniracetam were able to block non-GABAergic
antinociception also. comparing the effects of piracetam and aniracetam with
those exerted by the GABAB antagonist CGP 35348, a reduction of non-GABAergic
analgesia was also observed using higher doses of CGP 35348 (2.5 micrograms per
mouse ICV). The present results indicate that piracetam and aniracetam, by
preventing both of the investigated effects of baclofen, have some selectivity
against GABAB-mediated inhibition. The well-known activity of piracetam and
aniracetam on learning and memory might, therefore, depend, at least in part,
on the removal of inhibitory GABAB mechanisms that impair attention and
cognitive functions.<p>

ABSTRACT:  In step-down test, diazepam (1 mg.kg-1 po, 1 h before training) was
shown to significantly impair memory acquisition in mice. But piracetam (200
mg.kg-1 ip, 1 h before training) was found to improve the diazepam-induced
impairments of learning. By photocell cage method, piracetam showed no
significant inhibitory effect on the diazepam-induced spontaneous motor
activity in mice. In Y-maze test, Glutamic acid (0.1 microgram, icv, 3 min
before training) significantly improved learning in normal mice and the amnesic
effect of GABA and diazepam were completely antagonized by Glutamic acid and
piracetam (200 mg.kg-1 ip, 1 h before training). These results suggest that
increasing GABA-ergic neuronal transmission is unfavorable to learning and
memory, but increasing Glu-ergic transmission is contrary to the former. It
seemed that the presence of Glu/GABA system in the brain could regulate
learning and memory.<p>

ABSTRACT:  Angelman syndrome (AS) results from lack of genetic contribution
from maternal chromosome 15q11-13. This region encompasses three GABAA receptor
subunit genes (beta3, alpha5, and gamma3). The characteristic phenotype of AS
is severe mental retardation, ataxic gait, tremulousness, and jerky movements.
We studied the movement disorder in 11 AS patients, aged 3 to 28 years. Two
patients had paternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 15, 8 had a &gt;3 Mb
deletion, and 1 had a microdeletion involving loci D15S10, D15S113, and GABRB3.
All patients exhibited quasicontinuous rhythmic myoclonus mainly involving
hands and face, accompanied by rhythmic 5- to 10-Hz electroencephalographic
(EEG) activity. Electromyographic bursts lasted 35 +/- 13 msec and had a
frequency of 11 +/- 2.4 Hz. Burst-locked EEG averaging in 5 patients, generated
a premyoclonus transient preceding the burst by 19 +/- 5 msec. A cortical
spread pattern of myoclonic cortical activity was observed. Seven patients also
demonstrated myoclonic seizures. No giant somatosensory evoked potentials or
C-reflex were observed. The silent period following motor evoked potentials was
shortened by 70%, indicating motor cortex hyperexcitability. Treatment with
piracetam in 5 patients significantly improved myoclonus. We conclude that
spontaneous, rhythmic, fast-bursting cortical myoclonus is a prominent feature
of AS.<p>
