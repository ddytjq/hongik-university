			<H2>FAI 1000 - Bathurst, 16th - 19th November 2000</H2>

			<H1>MUD!</H1>
			<P>Mud, rain, more rain and definately more mud. That was it for five days. You could say the mountain really turned it on for us.</P>
			<P>A whole week of rain set the stage for one of the most exciting Bathurst races ever held.</P>

			<H4>PRACTICE AND QUALIFYING</H4>
			<P>This was the debut of our "new" car. Mal had purchased the ex Chris Smerdon VS Commodore in October and spent the interim rebuilding it to his satisfaction. Now it was time to see how it went but the appaling conditions made it difficult to gain any real insight into it's set-up. Christian also needed time in the car to familiarise himself with it and with one session cancelled due to weather, that time was hard to find.</P>
			<BR>
			<P>Despite all this, Mal was able to turn in a time of 2:28.7735 in the terrible conditions, while many of the teams - half the field in fact, were more than a little concerned by the 107% rule*. So were the organisers it seems as the rule was ultimately waived on Saturday.</P>
			<P>Mal was pretty happy with the car and the grip from the Bridgestone tyres.</P>
			<IMG SRC="bmalpits.JPG" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=255 BORDER=0 ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Waiting for his turn in practice">

			<BLOCKQUOTE><I>"In those conditions, I was surprised at how the cars were doing 270km down Conrod Straight in the wet. In the dry the cars do 280km, that's only 10km difference. It certainly showed that with the Bridgestone Tyres and the dynamics of a V8 Supercar, you can get fantastic performance out of the car."
			<BR>"The wet weather is certainly a leveller amongst the driving field.  In practice and qualifying sessions I had the car up into the top 15 out of 55 cars."
			</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
			
			<P>The only drama for the team was when the car broke the diff, but slick teamwork soon rectified this and in a drier session where the times tumbled, Mal finally settled for 36th on the grid with a lap of 2:19.6271.</P>
			<P>Saturday was a quite one for any team outside the Top Ten, and our team made use of that to replace the power steering as a precaution, as the car had felt a little heavy over the top of the mountain. Aside from that, the usual checking and re-checking of everything took up most of the day followed by a late afternoon practice session.</P>
			<P>All was in readiness...</P>
