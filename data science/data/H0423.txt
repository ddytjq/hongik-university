</b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The relation of the
dinosaurs to the avian lineage.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the hypothesis
presented, the avian lineage emerged from a group of quadrupedal
diapsid amniotes. Until the bipedal stage this lineage was also a
dinosaurian lineage.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">At the bipedal stage the pectoral
girdle tended to be reduced, but it was retained in the
bird-ancestors because they adopted the tree-mounting behaviour
which was maintained until the flying stage. At this stage the
pectoral skeleton and musculature became an essential part of the
flight apparatus.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In the course of evolution, the
avian lineage is likely to have split up in various forms, which
occupied ecological niches of their own in the prehistoric
faunas, and many of these abandoned the tree-climbing behaviour. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In such non-climbing offshoots
the retained reduction of the pectoral girdle could be resumed
and accomplished, depending on the time elapsed. The later they
branched off, the more avian they were. And the closer to the
avian lineage they were, the lesser the pectoral girdle was
reduced. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">According to this, the
facultatively bipedal pseudosuchians of Triassic, i.g. <i>Euparkeria</i>,
with their broad scapula and their rather complete clavicles and
interclavicles (Ever, 1965) were close to the earliest bipedal
pro-avians, whereas <i>Ornithosuchus</i> (Walker, 1965) of Upper
Triassic, <i>Alosaurus</i> of Jurassic, and <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
of Cretaceous, with respectively more reduced pectoral girdles
and forelimbs, were more distant derivates from the pro-avian
lineage.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">A group of bipedal dinosaurs, the
birdlike coelurosaurs, contemporaries of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and
the most bird-like even younger than this, also retained the
forelimbs although the number of digits was reduced and the power
of supination and the movability was restricted (Gregory, 1917).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Some coelurosaurs, such as <i>Oviraptor</i>
(Osborne, 1924), <i>Segigaurus</i>, (Camp, 1936) and <i>Velociraptor</i>
(Kielan-Jarowska &amp; Barsbold, 1972) are described as having
also retained interclavicles or clavicles.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This is a strong indication that
the coelurosaurs, among these the ornithomimosauria and the
deinonychosauria of Cretaceous, especially coelurosaurs with
retained clavicles, were late offshoots of the avian lineage as
supposed by Heilmann (1926).</font> <font face="Times New Roman">Fig.
15. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Archaeopteryx</i> with its
general shape of a small coelurosaur seems to be an ideal
representative of a late pre-bird with its furcula, its
hook-shaped claws (Yalden, 1985), its functional hindtoe, and,
above all, its feathered wings and tail. Nothing but the
improbability that the only known bird-like fossil were direct
bird ancestor exclude it from being the earliest member of the
avian class. (Swinton, 1960; Ostrom, 1976 a) </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">If it, however, lacked a sternum
(Ostrom, 1976 b; otherwise de Beer, 1954), it is, of course,
excluded from the direct ancestry of birds.</font><a
href="oricom.htm#note6"><font color="#FF0000"><sup>6</sup></font></a>)
<font face="Times New Roman">It might then be considered to be a
late offshoot from the avian lineage, maybe a
&quot;near-bird&quot; which has abandoned the flying capacity and
lived solely on the ground at the shores by Solnhofen.</font></p>
