<h3><a name="What">What is Hepatitis C?</a></h3>
<p>Hep C is a blood-borne virus that infects and can
seriously damage the liver.  Testing was first
available in 1990; before that, this and other
hepatitis viruses were referred to as non-A, non-B.
Those most at risk include people who received
blood transfusions prior to the onset of screening
for the virus in 1990, people exposed to
contaminated needles (through tattooing,
acupuncture, IV drug use or inoculations in
developing countries), and health care workers.
But the source of infection is simply unknown for
15-40% of sufferers.  It is estimated that up to 2%
of the Canadian population carry the Hep C virus.</p>

<h3><a name="How sick will I get">How sick will I get?</a></h3>
<p>Hep C is still a mystery virus.  Many of those infected do not get sick, or feel ill only for a brief time, but 50-70% will develop chronic hepatitis.  Chronic Hep C can lead to liver disease, including cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) and liver cancer.  An estimated 20% of people with chronic hepatitis will develop cirrhosis.  Hep C accounts for about one third of cases of cirrhosis, the seventh-leading cause of death in Canada.
Symptoms of chronic HepC, which may not appear for a long time after the initial infection, include fatigue , jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes), nausea and hair loss.  In more serious cases, loss of liver function leads to build-up of toxins in the blood.  Early signs of toxin build- up may include unresponsiveness, forgetfulness, trouble concentrating or sleeping.  Weight loss and water retention may occur.</p>

<h3><a name="Can it be treated">Can it be treated?</a></h3>
<p>The only treatment currently approved for Hep C
is Interferon, which is an artificial
version of a natural product of the body that
interferes with virus reproduction.  It is injected,
and effective for up to 25% of patients. Interferon
suppresses the virus; it does not eliminate it.  Side
effects can include flu-like symptoms, fever,
fatigue, headaches, weight loss, nausea and
muscle/bone pain.<p>

<h3><a name="What can I do">What can I do?</a></h3>
<p>There are ways to help the liver help itself.  The
risk of cirrhosis increases with alcohol use;
alcohol consumption should be stopped.
Exposure to air and food toxins (e.g., paint
fumes, nicotine, chemical preservatives) should
be avoided to reduce the amount of work the
liver has to do.
Many people have been helped by various
alternative therapies such as homeopathy,
naturopathy, herbal remedies and massage
therapy.  Consult you doctor.
Those willing to &quot;fight back&quot; have a better chance
of suppressing the virus-- your spirit and attitude
have a profound bearing on your health and
well-being.</p>

<h3><a name="Is my family at risk">Is my family at risk?</a></h3>
<p>Hep C is spread through contact with blood.  The risk of household transmission is unknown, but probably very low.  However, standard measures for avoiding exposure to other people's blood should be followed; for example, avoid sharing razors, toothbrushes and other personal hygiene items.  A small but real possibility exists for sexual transmission of Hep C. The rate is estimated at up
to 2.5% of prolonged sexual exposure to an infected person.
There is some evidence that the virus can occasionally be spread from mother to child, but the risk very low.  The exact time of infection (in the womb, during childbirth, or when
breast-feeding) has not been clarified.</p>

<h3><a name="Where can I go for help">Where can I go for help?</a></h3>
<p>The Hepatitis C Society of Canada (HECSC) is a non-religious, non-partisan national charitable organization dedicated to supporting all those with Hep C. The mandate of HECSC is:
<ul>
<li>To provide counselling, comfort and support to those who are infected with Hep C, as well as family members, friends and members of the general public who have concerns about the virus. 
<li>To educate and generate awareness among those infected with Hep C and among other Canadians about its transmission, care, prognosis and prevention.
<li>To compile data which will contribute to the reduction of Hep C, its prevention and/or cure. 
<li>To seek justice for those transfused with HepC and for all who are disabled by the virus.
</ul>
</p>

<h3><a name="HeCSCs Mission">HeCSC' Mission is....  To Support</a></h3>
<p>Many who are infected with Hep C have experienced isolation, uncertainty and fear about the future.  HECSC members have found that the support and experience-sharing of others with Hep C helps to overcome that sense of isolation.  There are now approximately 30 chapters of the Society formed or that are in the process of forming across Canada.  There may be a support group near you-- or we can help you to start one!</p>

<h3><a name="To Educate">To Educate</a></h3>
<p>HECSC compiles and makes available educational
materials concerning Hep C to members of the
general public, the medical community, policy
makers, and to our own membership.  Those who
have Hep C need as much information as possible
about the disease if they are to manage their daily
lives effectively.  And every Canadian must know
of the scope of the problem and preventative
measures if the spread of Hep C is to be stopped.</p>

<h3><a name="To Seek Justice">To Seek Justice</a></h3>
<p>HECSC is in dialogue with public health officials
and government representatives about Hep C
issues, including the equality of access to
disability pension plans, fair treatment from
employers and needed improvements to the
security of Canada's blood supply.  Compensation
is being demanded and sought for those who
developed Hep C through tainted blood
transfusions.</p>
