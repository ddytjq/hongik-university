<h2>18.11 Hardware interrupt hooking has its subtleties</h2>

<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: I did everything you tell me to install the interrupt handler
correctly, but my program occasionally still hangs<small>...</small>.</em>

<br><p>
<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: From time to time my program crashes with a message "Page Fault
in RMCB".  What's that?</em>

<br><p>
<p><strong>A</strong>:  Hooking interrupts in DJGPP (and in protected mode in general)
has a few subtle aspects.  In general, hardware interrupt handling in
DJGPP v2.x is rock solid <strong>if you play by the rules</strong>. 
Unfortunately, the rules are a bit tricky.

<p>One cause of your problems might be that your interrupt handler or some
memory location it uses get paged out because of the virtual memory
mechanism, or because your program spawned a child program.  In that
case, the interrupt might cause a call to a non-existent service
routine, with the obvious results.  You should lock all the memory pages
that your handler accesses by calling the
<code>__dpmi_lock_linear_region</code> library function.  This also means in
practice that you should write your handler in assembly, as described in
<a href="faq18_9.html">how to set an interrupt handler</a>, above.  You can disable virtual memory, or put
<code>_CRT0_FLAG_LOCK_MEMORY</code> into <code>_crt0_startup_flags</code> to make
sure nothing is paged out (but then your program might not have enough
memory to run, unless you run on memory-abundant systems).

<p>When CWSDPMI detects that your handler accesses memory that is not
locked, it aborts your program with a message saying "Page Fault in
RMCB".  This can happen if your program installs a callback for
some real-mode service, like the mouse callback, as well as if you
install a hardware interrupt handler; in both of these cases you need to
lock all the memory touched by your handler or by functions it calls. 
CWSDPMI aborts your program if your program attempts to page while an
interrupt handler or a real-mode callback are active, because paging
uses DOS file I/O.  Since DOS is non-reentrant, if the hardware
interrupt handler was called in a middle of another DOS call, paging
could badly damage your hard disk<a rel=footnote href="faq25.html"><sup>37</sup></a>.  By refusing to page in these cases, CWSDPMI ensures
the stability of your system and integrity of your files.  You pay for
that stability by having to lock all code and data touched by the
handler.

<p>Another problem might be that the hardware peripheral you use generates
a lot of interrupts.  Due to specifics of hardware interrupts handling
in protected mode, there is a substantial overhead involved with
reflection of interrupts between real and protected modes.  For
instance, on a 486DX/33 this reflection might consume up to 3000 clocks;
on a 386SX/16, even a 1KHz clock might eat up 1/2 of available cycles. 
One user reported that a 120 MHz Pentium will be able to service up to
45-50K interrupts per second before exhausting its CPU resources, and a
486DX/50 is capable of about half that number.  If your hardware fires
too many interrupts, your CPU might not be able to keep up.  A good rule
of thumb is to consider 20KHz as the breaking point, if your program
needs to do something non-trivial besides servicing interrupts.  If you
are beyond that interrupt rate, consider reducing the interrupt
frequency, or move some of the processing done inside the interrupt
handler to some other place.  Use a ring-0 DPMI server such as CWSDPR0
or PMODE/DJ (of these two, the latter is the faster one) which don't
swap interrupt stacks--this will reduce the overhead of the interrupt
reflection to some degree.  If your handler is written in C, write it in
assembly and make sure it doesn't chain.  And most important--make sure
your program keeps the processor completely in protected mode while
handling high-frequency interrupts: avoid unnecessary library calls,
disk I/O, BIOS calls, and anything else that could generate a mode
switch.  For example, using BIOS services to wait a certain period of
time while interrupts come in is clearly a bad idea when the interrupts
come at high frequency.

<p>Installing a good memory manager will usually also remove most of the
mode switch overhead, since a memory manager runs the CPU in V86 mode,
where hardware interrupts are delivered in protected mode by the
processor, without any need for a mode switch.

<p>Preventing the program from paging (by installing enough physical RAM
and using memory efficiently) will also help keeping the CPU in
protected mode, since paging is done by calling DOS in real mode.  By
keeping your processor in protected mode as much as you can, you avoid
the expensive mode switches when the interrupts are reflected to your PM
handler.

<p>If all that still doesn't help, install a real-mode handler.

<p>Some losing memory managers, notably EMM386, were reported to induce a
high interrupt handling overhead.  In one case, a user reported an
increase in the maximum interrupt rate his program could support from 2
KHz to 6 KHz after uninstalling EMM386.

<p>Still another possibility is that you use a non-default <code>sbrk</code>
algorithm in your program.  Check if the header file <code>crt0.h</code> is
included anywhere in the program, and if so, if the
<code>_CRT0_FLAG_UNIX_SBRK</code> bit in the <code>_crt0_startup_flags</code>
variable is set by the program.  If it is, then a hardware interrupt
which happens at the wrong time could crash your machine, especially if
you run under Windows 3.X.

<p>You should also keep in mind that the DPMI server can decide to handle
some of the interrupts itself and not pass them to your program,
although this is rare.  For example, Windows 9X won't pass the
<kbd>Ctrl-Alt-Del</kbd> combination to your keyboard interrupt handler, but
will rather act on it itself; QDPMI sometimes processes <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd>
keypresses so that your program never sees them, etc.  Sometimes, but
not always, you can change some configuration option to make some keys
get to your handler (e.g., the Alt-TAB setting on the Windows3.X
<code>.PIF</code> file).

<p>If the above still doesn't explain your problem, then post your code on
the <a href="mailto:djgpp@delorie.com">DJGPP mailing list</a> or
the <a href="news:comp.os.msdos.djgpp">comp.os.msdos.djgpp news group</a>, tell there how it fails and somebody will
usually have a solution or a work-around for you.
