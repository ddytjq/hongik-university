								</div>
								<ul>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">If you do register, of course, you will be able to enter the site, get notified of racing jobs and take advantage of its services.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">And, there really is no reason <i>not</i> to register. Your confidentiality is assured.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">To begin with, we do not ask for any demographic information, only information an employer would expect to see (none of that &quot;What operating system do you use?&quot; stuff). We do not have any &quot;business partners&quot; with whom we are going to share your information. You will only hear from us regarding information related to the kind of jobs you are interested in.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">Don't even want to hear from us at all? No problem, you can set your personal preferences so that you don't.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">Want employers to see your resume but don't want anyone to have your contact information? Again, no problem. You can set your information to withhold your contact information (employers would have to contact you by sending an email from a form on this website).</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">Want to be able to send your resume out but not have employers see it on the website. Again, you can set your personal preferences so that your resume doesn't show up in searches by employers.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">So, with your privacy protected and some great services available, it makes sense to register now.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">If you still prefer to wait, you can sign up for our free weekly email newsletter that notifies you of new job openings, employers who have joined, etc. All you need to provide is an email address. Visit our registration page.</font></p>
								</ul>
								<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><a name="Anchor-Othe-62816"></a></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2"><b>Other job databanks do not charge candidates for their services. Even though your fees are very reasonable, why does JobsInMotorsports.com charge at all? <a href="#Anchor--Oth-59261"><img height="22" width="72" src="../image/button_to_top.gif" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a></b></font></p>
								<ul>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">True, most job banks charge the employers instead of the candidates. In fact, most job banks charge the employers between $2,500 and $12,000 per year to place job ads and search their database.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">Unfortunately, if you are trying to find a racing job, this causes a problem. Most motorsports employers balk at paying those fees. Since a job site is worthless without jobs, our services are free to employers. That means more jobs for you. </font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">We also wanted this site to help teams looking for volunteers. Volunteering is often the best way for a candidate to break into Motorsports. Volunteering gives you experience, something to put on your resume, people to use as references and begins building a network of contacts in Motorsports for you who can help you find future jobs. By having volunteer jobs posted on JobsInMotorsports.com, we would be creating more opportunities for those of you looking to start a career in Motorsports. Making this site free for teams seeking volunteers means they can and will post those volunteer jobs on the JobsInMotorsports.com </font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">So, by charging candidates a small amount, we can keep the services completely free to the employers. Even the smallest racing team can and will take advantage of a deal like that and even the best funded team or track isn't likely to pass up the opportunity.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">The net result is that JobsInMotorsports.com is where a motorsports employer is likely to look for their next employee. If you want that racing job, isn't it worth the few dollars to get your resume to the place where it will do you the most good: sitting on the computer of the motorsports employer's person in charge of staffing?</font></p>
								</ul>
								<div align="left">
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b><a name="Anchor-Ho-10985"></a></b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2"><b>How can I be sure listing my resume on JobsInMotorsports.com and purchasing the Resume Forwarding service is a sound decision?</b></font><a href="#Anchor-Ho-61845"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><img height="22" width="72" src="../image/button_to_top.gif" align="absmiddle" border="0"></font></a></p>
									<ul>
										<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Although there are no guarantees you will get a job, each of the employers listed in the employer groups has chosen to participate in this service and use it because it is valuable to them. There are three reasons why:</font></p>
									</ul>
									<ol>
										<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">This resume databank is specific to racing jobs. All the candidates who list their resumes here either have motorsports experience or a strong desire to work in the field.</font>
										<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">The services are free to the employer. Typically, employers have to pay to search resume databanks or place a job listing. Needless to say, they will look to the free service first.</font>
										<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">The services are uniquely structured for their convenience. The Resume Forwarding system puts the information they need at their fingertips on their own computer where it is much faster to access, easier to read through and print out. </font>
									</ol>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b><a name="Anchor--Wi-55313"></a></b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2"><b>Will employers see my resume if I enter it but don't forward it?</b></font><a href="#Anchor-Wil-50456"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b><img height="22" width="72" src="../image/button_to_top.gif" border="0" align="absmiddle"></b></font></a></p>
									<ul>
										<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Employers can search the entire database, including resumes that have not been forwarded to their employer group, by going on line. So yes, your resume is available to them. </font></p>
										<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">However, because it is so convenient, employers will very likely search the forwarded emails that are stored on their computer first. If they find good prospects there, they may not bother searching the online database. Resume Forwarding is priced very reasonably. To be sure you give yourself the best opportunity to get the racing job you want, we recommend you use Resume Forwarding to send your resume to the employer groups you are most qualified for.</font></p>
									</ul>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b><a name="Anchor--H-63093"></a></b></font><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">How long is candidate information kept in the databank?</font></b><a href="#Anchor-Ho-53051"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b><img height="22" width="72" src="../image/button_to_top.gif" border="0" align="absmiddle"></b></font></a></p>
									<ul>
										<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Your resume is available to employers for as long as you are registered. Registration is good for one year. The first year's registration is free (18 months if you register with an Agent Code).</font></p>
										<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">We have chosen a one year registration period in order to retain resumes for a full year because motorsports hiring is largely cyclical based on the racing seasons of each series. This ensures that candidates and employers have a fair chance of connecting with each other during the peak-hiring season while still ensuring the information is reasonably current. It is your responsibility to keep your resume and contact information current.</font></p>
										<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">If you let your registration lapse, your resume will still be there. All you need to do is reregister to make your resume available again. </font></p>
									</ul>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b><a name="Anchor-Ho-42068"></a></b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2"><b>How often should I forward my resume to employers?</b></font><a href="#Anchor-Ho-47573"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b><img height="22" width="72" src="../image/button_to_top.gif" border="0" align="absmiddle"></b></font></a></p>
									<ul>
										<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">There are a number of factors to consider in this decision. First, motorsports hiring is seasonal. Most of the hiring is done during the off-season, generally over the winter months. Second, we recommend to employers that they keep the resume emails for at least one year (they don't take up much space, so why not?).</font></p>
										<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">If it has been less than one year since you used the Resume Forwarding service and the off-season hasn't gone by yet, be patient. There really is no purpose in forwarding your resume again. If it has been over one year then it is possible the employers have deleted your resume and you might consider using Resume forwarding again.</font></p>
										<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Of course, when you have made changes to your resume that demonstrate valuable new skills and experience or your contact information has changed then it is certainly a good idea to use Resume Forwarding again. You want to present yourself in the best light you can and be sure employers can reach you.</font></p>
									</ul>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b><a name="Anchor-Wha-396"></a></b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2"><b>I forwarded my resume but have not heard from anyone. Shouldn't I have gotten a reply or heard by now?</b></font><a href="#Anchor-Wha-55778"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><b><img height="22" width="72" src="../image/button_to_top.gif" border="0" align="absmiddle"></b></font></a></p>
									<ul>
										<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">You probably can not expect to hear back from employers when you forward your resume to them. Some might have the courtesy and the technical knowledge to generate an automatic reply, but most will simply file your resume email in a mailbox within their email program. We are all busy and people in the motorsports industry are busier than most.</font></p>
										<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">When an employer has a position to fill, they will search the emails in that mailbox for keywords that define the person they are looking for. Whether your email comes up in that search will depend on whether your information contains the key words they are searching for. Obviously, it is very important that you include the appropriate words and phrases in your resume. As you fill in your resume you will find several lists to select terminology from. These same lists are provided to the employers so that they search for the same terms that you use in your resume. This should make your chances of being found better and their chances of finding the right people better.</font></p>
										<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Of course, even if your resume does come up in their search, there may be more qualified people found at the same time. In addition to offering suggestions on how to create the best resume, we also offer more general suggestions on things you can do to improve your opportunities to advance in your motorsports career.

									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">There are three clear advantages to using the JobsInMotorsports.com Jobs Applications Service subscription to send your resume to the employer:</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">First, and most importantly, receiving your resume in the format JobsInMotorsports.com sends it is more convenient to the employer and therefore more likely to be seen and read. Your resume email arrives identified with the job you are applying for. It goes directly to the staffing person and can be directed right into a mailbox for that specific job. If you are that staffing person, where are you going to look first: an inbox piled with paper or a mailbox in your email program that you know already has the resumes for that specific job and which are organized in a consistent manner making it easy for you to skim through and find the most likely candidates?</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">Second, what is your time worth? How long does it take you to locate the appropriate postal address for the employer? How long does it take to draft a cover letter, print out the cover letter, resume and addressed envelope and then get it to the mailbox ? What about the cost of the paper, envelope and stamp or Fax phone time? Even if you are attaching your resume to an email, how long does it take to search the web for the email address? A lot of Motorsports employers still don't provide email addresses for sending your resume. Is it worth all that to save the subscription fee? Don't forget that the subscription lets you apply for as many posted jobs in that group as you want.</font></p>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">Third, a subscription notifies you by email whenever a new job is posted in the employer group. You get a head start on other candidates who wait for the weekly newsletter. The email even includes a link so that two button clicks sends your resume/application.</font></p>

								<ul>
									<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">While one or the other may serve your needs, there are advantages to doing both. Like any of us, the person in charge of staffing for motorsports employer tends to have personal preferences. Some will place a Job Listing as soon as they have a job opening because that is what they are accustomed to doing. Others will search the resume emails they have on their computer first and contact those people before deciding if they need to place a Job Listing. If you only do one or the other, you may miss an opportunity</font></p>
