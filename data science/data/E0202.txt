                        <p> <b>EMERYVILLE, CA, August 22, 2000 --</b> Sybase, 
                          Inc. (Nasdaq: SYBS) today announced that it plans to 
                          release the source code for the Sybase(R) Watcom(TM) 
                          C/C++ and Watcom Fortran compilers under an Open Source 
                          license agreement. This move is designed to allow existing 
                          customers to continue to evolve the Watcom compiler 
                          products for their own use.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We've had tremendous interest from 
                          our customers in Open Source versions of our Watcom 
                          compiler products," said Rob Veitch, director of Business 
                          Development, Sybase, Inc. "Sybase feels that leveraging 
                          the tremendous talent pool in the Open Source community 
                          is the best way to enable customers to continue to support 
                          and evolve these products into the future."</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sybase has selected SciTech Software, 
                          Inc. as the official maintainer of the Watcom compiler 
                          source code, which is planned to be released under the 
                          "Open Watcom" moniker. SciTech was selected due to its 
                          heavy use of Watcom products, its extensive cross platform 
                          experience and its record of Open Source involvement; 
                          SciTech released its commercial SciTech MGL graphics 
                          library to the Open Source community in 1997. Among 
                          its duties as official maintainer, SciTech will manage 
                          the Open Watcom web site (<a href="http://www.openwatcom.org" target="">http://www.OpenWatcom.org</a>), 
                          which will host the project source code, bug tracking 
                          database, developer discussion groups, and official 
                          binaries for free download. SciTech will also be heavily 
                          involved in the continued development of Open Watcom 
                          products.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "SciTech is a long time user of 
                          Watcom products and considers them among the best compilers 
                          around," said Kendall Bennett, Director of Engineering 
                          at SciTech Software, Inc. "We are ecstatic to be involved 
                          in a project that breathes new life into such awesome 
                          products and harnesses the creative energies of the 
                          entire 'Net community to enhance them into the future."</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Open Watcom compiler products 
                          are the first and only mass-market commercial compilers 
                          to be open sourced and, with more than a million lines 
                          of source code, the Watcom compiler products represent 
                          one of the largest pools of commercial source code of 
                          any type ever released under an Open Source license. 
                          Sybase plans to release the code under an Open Source 
                          license that<br>
                          will comply with the Open Source Definition (version 
                          1.7), published by the Open Source Initiative (<a 
              href="http://www.opensource.org" target="_blank">http://www.opensource.org</a>).</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As a member of Team Sybase supporting 
                          Watcom compiler products, this shows that Sybase listens 
                          to their Watcom compiler customers and has their best 
                          interests at heart," said Stephen Howe, a member of 
                          the Team Sybase online support group. "I am delighted 
                          for all Sybase Watcom customers regarding this announcement."</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SciTech Software and a select group 
                          of external developers will initially create and distribute 
                          a binary patch upgrade release (11.0c) on the Open Watcom 
                          web site. This binary patch will be available free of 
                          charge to existing Watcom C/C++ and Fortran customers 
                          and will include bug fixes developed by Sybase since 
                          the last commercial update of the product (11.0b). Following 
                          the binary patch release, the source for the Open Watcom 
                          compiler products will be released on the Open Watcom 
                          web site, so that any developer will be able to use 
                          and modify the code.</p>
