    the return of some nice weather more in line with the apparent summer race date. David
    Balfour trained a treble in the first three races and was unlucky not to make it four in
    the last when the stable runner didn't get clear till late. On the other hand SA trainer
    Joe Hall had shocking luck. He had the two favoured runners in the two straight races with
    both drawing barrier two and after playing up in the stalls both were late scratchings.</font></td>
