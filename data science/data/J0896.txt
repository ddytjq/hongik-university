<TD align="Left"><FONT FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="2"><BR>Seven thousand kilometre’s is the kind of distance most motorists cover in five or six months. Nowadays, it's easy on the car and almost as easy on the driver. However, there are certain people within the Volkswagen Wolfsburg headquarters who think it's too easy.<BR>
<BR>
A lot too easy, in fact, and, just to prove the point, the Volkswagen people decided to try and cover this mileage in a rather shorter space of time. It shouldn't be five, four or even three months, they reasoned, nor even three weeks or three days, but just one day - 24 short, intense hours to drive a distance the equivalent of Paris to Moscow and back, and then on to Munich, Zagreb and most of the way to Athens.<BR>
<BR>
Not that Volkswagen wanted to do it just for the fun of it. The VW officials had a serious point to make: that the company intends to be a genuine contender in the high-stakes market for ultra-high-performance sports cars. Oh, yes - and having Volkswagen's name against the world 24-hour speed record in the Guinness Book of World Records would be handy, too.<BR>
<BR>
<center><IMG border="1" SRC="../../../Features/Technical/Storage/w12rec.jpg" hspace="9 "></center><BR>
<BR>
This is serious territory, demanding average speeds significantly higher than in that other car-breaking classic, the Le Mans 24 hours: only one circuit, Nardo in Italy, would allow the 300 km/h-plus lap speeds required. As for the car itself, the immense stresses involved in running flat-out for such a long stretch meant that, in addition to the novel six-litre W12 engine that the record bid was to showcase, every other component had to be to racing standard or higher. And quite naturally, given its high-profile success at Le Mans with Audi, it was Ricardo who received the call from VW's team manager, Rudolf-Helmut Strozyk, to develop the transmission for the record-bid car. <BR>
<BR>
"Certainly, the win with Audi was a big boost," says Stefan Sänger, European Business Manager at Ricardo's Driveline and Transmission division, "and the customer was aware that we had already supplied high-performance gearboxes in low volumes to both McLaren, for their F1 road car, and to Jaguar, for their XJ220. So we already had a track record in building transmissions for extreme tests." <BR>
     <BR>
But it proved to be more than just an exercise in putting together a suitable gearbox: once the transmission had been designed and manufactured, Ricardo also helped its W12 project partners, VW Research and the Italian body company ItalDesign, with the installation and conversion of the vehicles.<BR>
<BR>
Mick Battrick , Manager Vehicle Programmes at Ricardo's Vehicle Engineering division, takes up the story: "Volkswagen delivered a Lamborghini, and we then installed the W12 engine and our five-speed transmission. "One of the first challenges was to actually get the new engine and transmission into the vehicle," remembers Battrick. "It required comprehensive chassis modifications because the W12 engine, although very short, is much wider compared to the V12 engine from the Lamborghini platform. The level of structure change was quite considerable, as we also had to allow for performance exhaust manifolds down either side."<BR>
<BR>
     <BR>
The first car built by Ricardo was a mule - in effect a Lamborghini stripped of its original engine and 4WD drivetrain and fitted with the W12 engine, Ricardo transmission and new powertrain and driveline systems. "That vehicle was then used for initial testing and for demonstrations within VW to prove the concept," says Battrick. "The project manager within VW then received approval to go for the actual 24-hour event - he then decided he wanted a six-speed transmission, not a five-speed, and we were commissioned to build two more vehicles. One was to be another test vehicle, retaining the Lamborghini body, while the second was to be the actual vehicle used for the 24-hour record attempt, which would be fitted with a special body."<BR>
<BR>
     <BR>
Throughout, Ricardo dealt with more than just the transmission. Mick Battrick again: "Within the W12 team we were responsible for many vehicle installation tasks including all the usual powertrain and driveline systems, gear selector, intake, exhaust, thermal and fuel systems, together with a number of other areas besides." The programme, which by now had acquired the codename Violet, began to pick up serious speed in the middle of 2000 when it was decided to go for the record the following April.<BR>
<BR>
<center><IMG border="1" SRC="../../../Features/Technical/Storage/w12rec3.jpg" hspace="9 "></center><BR>
     <BR>
By the early part of 2001, Ricardo was supporting VW with technicians and engineers all across Europe conducting engine and transmission durability testing on the six-speed Lamborghini look-alike car at VW's Ehra test track. After each test session, the transmissions were brought back to Ricardo, stripped down, inspected and then rebuilt.<BR>
<BR>
In total, Ricardo made three complete six-speed units in addition to the first demonstrator transmission, plus two sets of internal spare parts. The idea was to rebuild the transmissions for the actual record event, because the only components that would wear would be the internal ones. In the event, of course, the actual record drive on 13 and 14 October ran like clock-work: the only headaches were some bodywork damage caused by debris on the track, and a minor flurry surrounding a damaged alternator pulley. But while a solid 24 hours at a blistering average of 296km/h can never be labelled undramatic, the session was certainly satisfyingly drama-free as far as the W12's mechanical elements were concerned. In fact confidence was so high that a decision was made to continue running past the 24 hours in order to break the 5000 miles world record.<BR>
<BR>
Naturally, the Ricardo transmission system was on the list of components which never missed a beat. But how, precisely, does a leading engineering provider face the daunting task of developing a system which will withstand those enormous loads, those temperatures and those g-forces for all that time? After all, failure - whether after half an hour or 23 and a half hour - is simply not an option. Stefan Sänger: "The process normally begins with a packaging requirement. The customer tells us what the space is and what the engine is, and then asks us whether we have a suitable gearbox." <BR>
<BR>
Another important part of the brief, says Battrick, was that the transmission system had to be as representative of a production unit as possible. A racing transmission, just like a racing engine, is designed to give absolute maximum performance and to last the length of the race but little longer; durability is sacrificed for performance.<BR>
<BR>
<center><IMG border="1" SRC="../../../Features/Technical/Storage/w12rec2.jpg" hspace="9 "></center><BR>
<BR>
For the W12 record bid, however, Ricardo needed to provide both performance and durability. "I think it is fair to say that the transmission we have developed for the W12 would be suitable for a roadgoing vehicle," observes Battrick, "though the stresses are not exactly the same as in a road car. We've tested this transmission in fifth and sixth gear continually, whereas in a road car you would be up and down through the gears more frequently." "For this type of testing the transmission is subject to a unique duty cycle, so you need to over-engineer those areas of the transmission that are subject to extreme loads," says Sänger. "But obviously for a pure road version you would have to revisit all the ratios and ensure they were all suitable." <BR>
<BR>
Normal practice is for race cars to have straight-cut gears for optimised strength, and for road cars to have helical gears for reduced noise. "That still applies," says Battrick, "and on this occasion we went for a road car transmission, complete with triple synchronisers for each gear." This contrasts with the transmission developed by Ricardo for Audi's Le Mans winners: this had dog-clutches instead of synchronisers, a system not suitable for road use.<BR>
<BR>
For the Nardo record bid Ricardo designed wholly new internals to fit inside an existing main casing design. "Clearly, we had to be able to sustain a racing type start at each pit stop and a quick shift up through the gears," says Battrick, "however once you're at maximum speed and in sixth gear the loadings are comparatively small. The areas you then have issues with are high temperatures and oil circulation, making sure that bearings and seals are all properly lubricated. The problem you tend to have is oil starvation as the g-force of the car going round the track pushes the oil to one side - you have to ensure baffles and oil pickups are in all the right places."<BR>
<BR>
A team of three to four Ricardo engineers managed the programme to configure, design, manufacture and assemble the transmissions. A further two to three helped with the conversion and development work on the vehicles. In terms of man-hours, however, it was much more intense than those figures suggest, especially as the deadlines imposed by the testing schedules were rigid and very real. "You can imagine that there were a lot of late nights being worked in order to get the vehicle ready on time to support these tests," says Battrick. "It was an excellent effort by all the guys in the team."<BR>
<BR>
In normal circumstances Ricardo would have done its own durability testing, but the compressed schedules and the fact that VW had run two complete 24-hour tests at Ehra provided more than enough confidence in the integrity of the transmission. "The main issue for us was the durability of the fifth and sixth gears," remembers Battrick. "The design principles are very similar to the XJ220, and we had previous experience of using that transmission in other 24-hour endurance events. Therefore we were confident that there were not going to be any major issues - that's not to say that we didn't have a couple of small problems, because we did."<BR>
<BR>
Quick, novel solutions soon put paid to those early teething troubles, and the transmission has performed faultlessly ever since. "The thing to remember," says Sänger, "is that in the normal world you would have at least two years to come up with a production design. In this instance we had just a few months and there was a lot of pressure to do the job - but the W12 project team got it done." Enough said?<BR>
