Controls</H3>
<P>Full-featured word processors allow users to insert
  page-breaks at arbitrary locations in documents.&nbsp;
  However, you will find no such feature in most applications
  based Rich Edit controls. 
</P> 
<P>The Rich Text Format (RTF) specification does, in fact,
  contain an RTF code for page-breaks
  (&quot;\page&quot;).&nbsp; Unfortunately, Rich Edit
  controls (versions 1.0 - 3.0) simply ignore it.&nbsp; (In
  fact, I think that version 1.0 actually removes the \page
  code or changes it to a paragraph.) 
</P> 
<P>This part of the paper describes a way to implement
  page-breaks.&nbsp; It builds on the prior three parts of
  the paper so, if you have not studied them, you should do
  so now. 
</P> 
<H4>The Technique</H4>
<P>The technique that I finally implemented is pretty
  straight-forward -- and more than a bit ugly.&nbsp; To be
  fair, it is more a &quot;proof of concept&quot; than a
  polished implementation.&nbsp; It requires the user to type
  a specific sequence of characters wherever he or she wants
  a page-break to occur.&nbsp; This marker is: 
</P> <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>&lt;&lt; Page Break &gt;&gt;</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Note that the user must key this exactly, spaces and
  all.&nbsp; However, it is not case sensitive. 
</P> 
<P>When printing or previewing the document, we search the
  text for the marker and build a list of locations where it
  appears in the document.&nbsp; Then we build the list of
  pages, limiting the range to be rendered to the sections of
  text before, between, and after the markers. 
</P> 
<P>I will not go into great detail here since it should be
  fairly clear in the code (available below).&nbsp; However,
  this technique is, as I mentioned, not pretty.&nbsp; Here
  are my suggestions on how you might improve it. 
</P> <UL>
<LI> Supply a button or key-combination for inserting the
marker.&nbsp; Format the marker text as protected so that
the user cannot delete or change it.&nbsp; Add a
notification handler to trap the EN_PROTECTED
message.&nbsp; In the handler, select the entire marker
text or, if it is already selected and the user is trying
to delete it, delete the marker. </LI>
<LI> Alternatively, use an embedded bitmap or other
OLE/ActiveX control instead of a text marker.&nbsp; You can
use the IRichEditOle interface to insert and delete the
marker objects and to index through the embedded objects
(instead of searching for the text marker). </LI>
<LI> Add code to the file loading and saving process to
convert the RTF \page code to and from the marker text or
object.&nbsp; This will allow the document to be shared
with word processors and retain the page-breaks. </LI>
</UL>
<P>If you implement any of these suggestions, please let me
  know -- I would love to see the results.

<P>The complete BCB 4.0 project for all four parts of this
  paper is available for download.&nbsp; If you have BCB 3.0,
  you can still use the code, but you will need to grab the
  BCB 3.0 project from Part 3 of this paper and copy parts of
  the source code from this project back into it.&nbsp;
