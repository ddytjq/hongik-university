            easier to scramble an egg than to unscramble it. Entropy is a measure 
            of the scrambledness of the energy, and because there are more ways 
            to be scrambled than to be unscrambled, the scrambledness of the energy 
            tends to increase. The entropy tends to go up. </font></font> 
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Energy 
              is simply the nature of the underlying existence showing through 
              in space and time, and its amount remains constant. It is only the 
              quality of the energy, its usefulness, that gets degraded. And entropy 
              is a measure of this degradation.<cite>&quot;Die Energie der Welt 
              bleibt konstant; die Entropie strebt einem Maximum zu.&quot; </cite>&nbsp; 
              (The energy of the world remains constant the entropy strives to 
              a maximum.) <cite>-- Rudolf Clausius (1822-1888).</cite> &nbsp; 
              This is a statement of the first and second laws of thermodynamics. 
              And the term laws doesn't mean edicts, but ally statements about 
              how matter behaves. Physics is about how matter behaves, and these 
              are statements about that. This is simply a statement that although 
              the energy in the Universe remains constant, the entropy tends to 
              go up. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negative 
              entropy is a measure of the usefulness of the energy. Gravitational 
              energy and the kinetic energy of large moving objects is completely 
              usable. Heat energy is not, because the directions of the motions 
              of the particles have been scrambled. That's what we call heat. 
              And temperature is a measure of the mean kinetic energy of the molecules. 
              When you panic stop on the freeway, the kinetic energy of your large 
              moving vehicle gets scrambled to heat by friction in the brake drums 
              and the brake shoes, the tire and the road. If you could unscramble 
              it, it would once again be the kinetic energy of your large moving 
              vehicle. Now if, instead of being scrambled by friction in the brakes, 
              the energy had been run into a flywheel (which is a large moving 
              object), you could have used it to restart your car. That's how 
              they restart the mail trucks and the milk trucks in Europe. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 
              all living organisms must find and use a source of energy less scrambled 
              at the start, life is impossible except in a world that is going 
              from bad to worse. All living organisms live in this cascade of 
              increasing entropy by directing streams of the increase through 
              their forms. For all living organisms, negative entropy is food. 
              When you eat it, it's cake; when you're through with it, you push 
              the plunger. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 
              last century, and in the early days of this century, it was usually 
              taken for granted that the mix of the chemical elements in the Universe 
              was given at the time of creation, if there was a creation, or had 
              been around forever, if there was a forever. (It was not known then 
              that the other chemical elements are fashioned from hydrogen in 
              the bellies of the stars.) And it was thought that if you just shuffled 
              the mix long enough, it might come out in the present configuration 
              again. But there was the problem of entropy. It was already known 
              that entropy tends to a maximum and would surely go up. (In those 
              days the expansion of the Universe had not been noted, nor its extent.) 
              Then, considering the consequences of the continuously increasing 
              entropy, it was thought that the Universe would eventually reach 
              a &quot;heat death.&quot; It was thought that eventually every chemical 
              reaction that could have taken place would have taken place, and 
              that everything that could have fallen would have fallen. And it 
              was thought that when all these other energies had gone to heat, 
              the Universe would be just a little warmer and life would be muffed 
              out. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it 
              turns out that, like life, the formation of galaxies and stars would 
              also be impossible except in this cascade of increasing entropy. 
              A galaxy could not be formed by stars falling together because the 
              stars would be too lonely to collide. The entropy would not go up 
              because the stars would not collide and therefore the energy of 
              falling would not be scrambled to heat. Galaxies are formed when 
              clouds of hydrogen fall together because the clouds are big enough 
              to collide. The clouds, unlike the stars, are large with respect 
              to the spaces between them. So the particles of each cloud collide 
              with the particles of the other cloud and thus scramble their motions 
              to heat. (Stars like the Sun have a density of more than a pound 
              per pint, whereas the density of the interstellar clouds is closer 
              to a pound per billion cubic miles.) It is because of their large 
              sizes that the clouds collide, and the energy of falling is transformed 
              to heat. We say that the entropy has gone up. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, 
              stars are formed when clouds of gas and dust collide because the 
              entropy goes up as the energy of falling is transformed to heat. 
              (Stars are not hot because of nuclear fusion at the core. They are 
              hot because the energy of falling has been transformed to heat. 
              The heat released by fusion simply keeps them from collapsing farther 
              and thus getting too hot. But it's only temporary.) </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Locally, 
              within the Universe, the entropy goes up. However, for the Universe 
              as a whole, the entropy may not go up. The observable Universe has 
              a border, some fifteen billion light years distant in all directions, 
              imposed on us by what is called &quot;the expansion.&quot; It is 
              imposed on the observer by the fact that all the distant objects 
              appear to be moving away. At some fifteen billion light years from 
              us (at the present apparent rate of expansion), they are estimated 
              to be receding at the speed of light. It is this apparent&quot; 
              expansion&quot; that imposes a border to the observable Universe 
              because things receding faster than the speed of light are not observable. 
              And if the rate of expansion were increased, the border would of 
              course be closer. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, 
              when we consider matter near the border, its radiation, as seen 
              by us, would be red-shifted (lowered in frequency) much as the pitch 
              of the fire engine's bell is lowered where the fire engine has passed 
              us and is going away. But if the energy of the radiation of the 
              distant particles is lowered, so too is the energy of the panicles 
              themselves, and therefore also their mass. (We know from Einstein's 
              1905 equations that what we see as matter is just potential energy. 
              Swami Vivekananda had suggested this to Nikola Tesla some ten years 
              earlier. But Tesla had failed to show it.) Now there are two very 
              interesting consequences of this apparent lowering of the mass. 
              First, radiation running through a field of low-mass particles would 
              be so often picked up and reradiated that it would be thermalized 
              to 3° Kelvin and would appear as the background radiation discovered 
              by Penzias and Wilson in 1965. Second, if the mass of the particles 
              approaches zero, their momentum must also approach zero (because 
              the momentum is the mass times the velocity, and the velocity approaches 
              a constant). But if the momentum approaches zero, so does our uncertainty 
              in that momentum. Then, by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, our 
              uncertainty in where they are must approach totality. (According 
              to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, if we can know where a particle 
              is, we cannot know its momentum. Likewise, if we can know its momentum, 
              we cannot know where it is. So if we can know the momentum of a 
              particle at the border, we cannot know that it's at the border. 
              We cannot know both its momentum and its position.) Now if the particles 
              thus recycle by &quot;tunneling&quot; back into the observable Universe 
              as hydrogen (with its gravitational energy thus restored) then the 
              entropy of the whole Universe might not increase.</font><font face="Arial"></font></p>
