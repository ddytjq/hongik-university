Five teams competed for thecoveted Jumbo Jug.  <P>1. White's Bar (Bill DePetro, Art McGuff, Joe Welch)<BR>2. Hartland Wildcats (Bill Begoske, John Begoske, Steve Trauger)<BR>3. Flatlanders (Lige Johnson, Dave Nesbitt, Will Sirrine, and sorry, I can'tremember the last guy's name)<BR>4. Dynamic Trio (Scott Brooks, Dave Brown, Roger Hill)<BR>5. East Coast Team (Dave Griffin, Bob Hoffman, Tom Painter).  <P>A round-robin format was played on Saturday and single-game, doubleelimination on Sunday.  Off and on downpours made Saturday play somewhat lessthan ideal but Sunday was sunny and hot.<P>   And the winners are (drum roll, please) White's Bar (Bill DePetro, ArtMcGuff, and Joe Welch).  White's Bar played inspired Guts all weekend, goingundefeated until the first game of the finals, losing 18-21.  On the otherhand, second place winners/losers Hartland Wildcats (Bill and John Begoskeand Steve Trauger) played uninspired Guts on Saturday, winning just twogames, and lost their first game on Sunday.  With their backs against thewall, they finally smelled the coffee and seemed to have remembered how toplay Guts.  But the proverbial wheels fell off that train (the score of thesecond game of the finals was 21-11) and Hartland Wildcats were on their wayto Chumpsville.  Congratulations, White's Bar - 1997 Guts Frisbee 3-Man WorldChampions!<P>Joe Welch was the deserving winner of Thor's Mighty Hammer, the travellingtrophy plaque awarded to the tournament MVP.  Toledo Joe answered the calldefensively with catches and bags and offensively with points from hisanhyzered backhand.  This is the second time Joe has won the award. (Personally, I am glad to see that Thor's Mighty Hammer will once again beassociated with the Guts Frisbee World Championships and awarded annually tothe player who demonstrates his ability most remarkably at that particularevent.)<P>Nobody asked but here's my all tournament team:  Joe Welch, Bob Hoffman (ofEast Coast Team and his smokin' backhand), and John Begoske (who did his bestto carry Hartland Wildcats).<P>Special mention must be made in this space for the sake of last year's winnerof Thor's Mighty Hammer.  As you may know, last year the MVP trophy was to beawarded to the player who accumulated the most "points" throughout the entireGuts Frisbee season.  The 1996 winner was Roger Hill.  Congratulations,Roger!  <P>Guts IS Catchin'!and scoring, which I did very little of...bummer - EVERYBODY liked my shot...<P>Steve Trauger  <P><A HREF="http://www.sas.it.mtu.edu/~dkwalika/frisbee/">Guts Home Page</A></BODY></HTML>
