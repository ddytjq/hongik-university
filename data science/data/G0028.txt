<BLOCKQUOTE>
How is the world different now that humanity can see few or no stars at night?
Urban light pollution has effectively eliminated the sight of constellations, nebulae,
comets, meteor showers and even planets for most people. When our view of the
heavens is dimmed, when only machines can see the galaxies, what happens to
our spiritual vision? This talk will explore the cultural and spiritual effects of light
pollution from the perspective of a Christian cosmologist. More broadly, just as good
stewardship requires a cautious approach to the environment, spiritual and scientific
exploration likewise can benefit together from the epiphanies awaiting the humble inquirer.

<H4>Introduction </H4>

"Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the oftener and
more steadily they are reflected on: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me."
These words from the Critique of Practical Reason are engraved on Immanuel Kant’s grave
as well as in our workshop program.  They are a perfect introduction to my theme tonight, the
erosion of our spiritual growth caused by the retreat of the night. <P>

 More than one hundred fifty years before Kant, astronomer Johannes Kepler wrote, "There is
nothing I want to find out and long to know with greater urgency than this. Can I find God,
whom I can almost grasp with my own hands looking at the universe, also in myself?" More
than anyone before him, Kepler – the man whose laws of planetary motion provided the rich
soil for Newton’s genius – had earned the right to seek God in the heavens. <P>

 As a Christian, I believe that it is God’s gift of the Holy Spirit rather than accumulation of
scientific evidence that brings faith and reveals God in our hearts. But I also know that awe
inspired by God’s miracle of creation helps soften our hearts and turn our minds to the
fundamental questions of being. <P>

Nearly three centuries after Kepler, all but a few have lost sight of Mars at night. Is it
awe-inspiring to know that a planet seen only in textbooks follows an ellipse around the sun?
[Show Kepler cartoon slide]  Clearly, not everyone thinks so.   But when our view of the
universe is blocked, is our spiritual vision also eclipsed? <P>

 [<a href="http://www.darksky.org/ida/graphics/ida_asp_05.gif">Show light pollution slide</a>]
Light pollution seriously handicaps astronomers’ investigation of the universe. Although the
scientific losses are great, the spiritual ones may be even greater. We live in an age when
popular sentiment careens between nihilism and self-improvement, when the selfishness of the
"Me" generation has given way to the restless spirit of Generation X. More than ever, humanity
needs a spiritual center. Wonder and mystery are a path that many discover to that center.
What more wonderful and mysterious place is there than the starry heavens above? <P>

In Psalm 8, King David wrote one of the most beautiful paeans of the heavens:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
          O Lord, our Sovereign, <BR>
          how majestic is your name in all the earth! <BR>
          You have set your glory above the heavens. <BR>
          Out of the mouths of babes and infants <BR>
          you have founded a bulwark because of your foes, <BR>
          to silence the enemy and the avenger. <BR>
          When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, <BR>
          the moon and the stars that you have established; <BR>
          what are human beings that you are mindful of them, <BR>
          mortals that you care for them? <BR>
          Yet you have made them a little lower than God, <BR>
          and crowned them with glory and honor. <BR>
          You have given them dominion over the works of your hands; <BR>
          you have put all things under their feet, <BR>
          all sheep and oxen, and also the beasts of the field, <BR>
          the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, <BR>
          whatever passes along the paths of the seas. <BR>
          O Lord, our Sovereign, <BR>
          how majestic is your name in all the earth! <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Tonight I will focus on the spiritual more than the scientific cost of light pollution, seeking insight
from ancient astronomy, modern cosmology, and humility theology. Although modern
environmental engineering has removed much of the direct contact with the stars our ancestors
had, many opportunities exist for celestial wonder. As we will see, celestial wonder still has
great power to inspire and transform. <P>

<H4>Light Pollution</H4>

During the twentieth century, outdoor lighting has become so bright that even remote
mountaintop observatories are seriously compromised. <P>

[<a href="http://www.darksky.org/ida/graphics/ida_asp_02.gif">Show slide of the world at night</a>]
Seen from space, the earth at night shines with the glow of urban lights, natural gas burnouts in the oil
fields of the Persian Gulf and elsewhere, tropical forests and grasslands burned for clearing, and fishing
lights used to lure squid to the surface of the Sea of Japan. In this entire image there is only one natural
source of light – the Aurora Borealis over Greenland. <P>

At the beginning of this century, the world’s greatest observatory was established on Mount
Wilson, overlooking Los Angeles. For several decades, the 100-inch telescope on Mount
Wilson made pioneering contributions, including Edwin Hubble’s discovery seventy years ago
of the expansion of the universe. Rapid urbanization and uncontrolled nighttime lighting quickly
diminished the observatory’s usefulness. Ironically, during World War II, nighttime blackouts
intended to protect Los Angeles from Japanese kamikaze attacks allowed astronomer Walter
Baade to push the telescope to its limits and measure individual stars in the nearby Andromeda
spiral galaxy. But by 1985, the lights of Hollywood and its surroundings forced the shutdown of
the Mount Wilson observatory. <P>

In 1910, an astronomy popularizer wrote, "If the reader has the good-fortune to be situated
where artificial lights do not interfere with the splendor of the heavens, he can observe the
course of the Milky Way on any clear night." Now most of us see the Milky Way only during
overnight camping trips to the mountains. <P>

As a young child, I loved to go out at night and was thrilled that I could identify the same stars
night after night. My friend Richard and I had read about a constellation called Orion
and we watched it move weekly across the winter sky beyond his back yard.
[<a href="http://www.darksky.org/ida/graphics/ida_asp_19.gif">Show Orion slide</a>]
We read about red giants, and I think Richard once intrigued me with stories of white dwarfs and
neutron stars.   I believe these evenings are where I first gleaned my calling as an astrophysicist.
(Richard became a stock broker.) It may also have been the beginnings of my spiritual growth.
Ever since that time, I feel comfort and joy in seeing my old friends, the stars of my youth. <P>

In Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain also expressed the spiritual side of youthful star-gazing:
"We had the sky, up there all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up
at them, and discuss about whether they was made, or only just happened." <P>

 [<a href="http://www.darksky.org/ida/graphics/ida_asp_18.gif">Show Light Pollution slide</a>]
Unfortunately, most of the time our view of Orion looks more like this. That red giant is still
there, but not much else. Isn’t this light pollution destructive of the environment, the
environment of our spiritual development? Surely our comfort and security don’t require so
much energy to be wasted in illuminating the sky. <P>

Indeed, light pollution is largely unnecessary and can be suppressed by environmental action,
just like pollution of our more tangible needs of air and water. But rather than suggesting a
solution, I’d like to explore the problem further, to see what our awe of the heavens can teach
us about spiritual development. <P>

<H4>Ancient Astronomy</H4>

A good way to investigate the spiritual significance of night vision is to turn to the astronomy of
the ancients, or at least of those peoples living before the era of electric lighting. As
archaeoastronomer Anthony Aveni writes, "All developing civilizations exhibit a reverence for
the sky and its contents. The cyclic movement of the sun, moon, planets, and stars represents a
kind of perfection unattainable by mortals. The regular occurrence of sunrise and moonset
provided the ancients with something dependable and orderly, a stable pillar to which their
minds could be anchored." <P>

The cyclic regularity of celestial patterns has two consequences that have been realized by
civilizations over and over again – one technological, the other spiritual. The first is that the sky
provides a clock and calendar. Agricultural civilizations needed to know when to plant and
harvest; the ancient Egyptians needed to predict the flooding of the Nile. The ancient
Babylonians and Chinese meticulously recorded the movements of the sun, moon and planets
through the skies. The ability to predict the heavens gave power, so that astronomers became
clients of the rulers. <P>

[<a href="http://www.le.ac.uk/archaeology/rug/image_collection/cd08/025.jpg">Show Stonehenge
slide with modern Druids</a>]
Each year, modern Druids assemble to celebrate the summer solstice at concentric circles of
stones erected more than 4000 years ago on the Salisbury Plains in England. <P>

[<a href="http://www.andover.edu/english/hardymisc/34.html">Show other Stonehenge slide</a>]
Stonehenge is the best-known bronze-age worship site, and it
may also have been a kind of astronomical observatory – albeit one where sacrifices or burials
took place. Many of the stones and holes align with the points of sunrise and sunset on the days
of the solstices, as well as with the extreme points of the moon's 18-year orbital precession
cycle. Archaeologists are handicapped in having no historical record. While there are other
similar ancient stone rings in Britain, there is no consensus on the astronomical sophistication of
their builders. The evidence suggests that at least Stonehenge and similar structures could have
been used as astronomical calendars. <P>

[<a href="http://indigo.stile.le.ac.uk/~rug/STILE/images/cd03/040.jpg">Show El Castillo slide</a>]
Similar hints of taming the sky come from the pyramids of Central America erected by the
Mayas. The sacred Mayan city of Chichen Itza has several thousand-year old sites that have
attracted attention for their astronomical alignments. This beautiful pyramid at Chichen Itza, El
Castillo, has a carved serpent's head at the base of one side. On the day of the equinoxes, the
setting sun creates a pattern of light and shadow that complete the body of the serpent. The
Maya and their Toltec successors are also known to have worshipped Venus, associated with
the god Quetzalcoatl. Chichen Itza also has a plausible observatory with positional alignments
for Venus. <P>

The second implication of the regularity of the heavens repeated in many civilizations is that
irregular or unexpected phenomena become elevated to the supernatural. The planets, or
wanderers in Greek, moved through the heavens in mysterious ways. Why did Mercury and
Venus never stray far from Helios, while the other planets circled the sky but sometimes
temporarily reversed their course through the zodiac? This apparent caprice translated to the
fickleness of the Greek and Roman gods. <P>

The ancient Greeks brought more than art and drama, philosophy and science, to Western
civilization. They also brought us astrology. The 12 constellations of the zodiac marked the path
of the sun and planets around the heavens. The Greeks systematized astronomy, catalogued the
stars, measured the radius of the earth, and constructed theories of the solar system. Their
astronomy combined science and myth. <P>

[<a href="http://www.cosmopolis.com/art/atlas.jpg">Show Atlas slide</a>]
In this classical sculpture at Villa Farnese in Italy, Atlas holds the heavens
on his shoulders - complete with the 48 classical constellations. In Greek mythology, Perseus,
having slain Medusa while viewing her only by reflection in Minerva’s shield, sought Atlas’
hospitality. Remembering a prophecy that a son of Zeus would one day rob his golden apples,
Atlas rejected Perseus, who then showed him Medusa’s head, turning him into stone. Whether
or not we believe in astrology, we can certainly enjoy the Greek's creativity.
[Show Harris slide: "Now try to find a few that look like a bear or a dog or something."] <P>

Comets also were awe-inspiring omens to the ancients. They still are.
[<a href="http://www.west.net/~ahallas/!hbml.htm">Show comet Hale-Bopp slide</a>]
During the last few years we’ve been treated to several
spectacular comets, including Hale-Bopp. You’ll remember this one sadly as the planned
rendezvous site for the Heaven’s Gate cult with alien beings after their mass suicide. But
during this season of Epiphany in the Christian calendar, I prefer to think of the possibility that
two thousand years ago a comet was the star of Bethlehem. Used as a navigation beacon by
the Magi, astrologers probably from Arabia or Persia, the new star moved through the sky,
finally coming to rest over Christ’s birthplace. In 1986, a spacecraft launched by the European
Space Agency flew by Halley’s comet
[<a href="http://sunserv.kfki.hu/~arthp/art/g/giotto/padova/3christ/scenes_1/chris02.jpg">Show
slide of Giotto's Adoration of the Magi</a>
The spacecraft was named Giotto to honor the fourteenth century artist whose fresco <i>Adoration of
the Magi</i>, including a comet resting over the manger, appears on the ceiling of Arena Chapel in Padua. <P>

Supernovae – exploding massive stars that brighten suddenly and fade over months – are a still
rarer spectacle. Perhaps for this reason they are less prominent in the history or mythology of
our ancestors. It is nevertheless surprising that there is no European record of the supernova of
1054, whose debris produced the Crab Nebula and its famous pulsar.
[<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap960531.html">Show slide of Crab Nebula</a>]
The event was recorded by Chinese astronomers. It also is
thought to appear in a petroglyph of the Anasazi Indians, the ancestors of present-day Hopis, at
their abandoned pueblos in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico. <P>

Native Americans have much to teach us about respect for the environment, celestial as well
as terrestrial. Black Elk, a living member of the Lakota Sioux tribe, eloquently wrote, "We say
that Wakan Tanka created the Heart of Everything That Is to show us that we have a special
relationship with our first and real mother, the earth, and that there are responsibilities tied to
that relationship. Wakan Tanka placed the stars in such a manner so what is in the heavens is
on earth, what is on earth is in the heavens in the same way. When we pray in this manner,
what is done in the skies is done on earth in the same way. Together, all of creation participates
in the ceremonies every year." (quoted in Lakota Star Knowledge: Studies in Lakota Stellar
Theology, compiled by Ronald Goodman of Sinte Gleshka University, Rosebud Reservation.) <P>

<H4>Astronomy from Space</H4>

Although our terrestrial view of the heavens is obscured more than ever before, public interest
in astronomy appears to be at an all-time high. I don’t think this is a paradox; people are hungry
for knowledge about the universe and enjoy the vicarious pleasure of a digital photograph from
space in place of an unimpressive view from the back yard. This circumstance gives me hope
that the interests of science and spirituality can be joined to partially counter our loss of the
night. <P>

[<a href="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/jpeg/M16Full.jpg">Show Eagle Nebula slide</a>]
The Hubble Space Telescope has advanced astronomy more than any telescope since Galileo
first turned the new invention to the sky nearly four hundred years ago. Among all the
scientifically and visually stunning results from the Hubble, none has caught the public’s
imagination more than this slide of dust pillars in a stellar nursery called the Eagle Nebula. As
an astrophysicist, I’d like to think it was our first-ever view of stars blowing away their
placental dust clouds that most interested people. But NASA received enough telephone calls
from people who thought they saw the face of Jesus here so that we have to acknowledge
another influence: people hunger for religious and spiritual connections with the universe. While
machines may replace our eyes, they cannot replace our souls. <P>

[<a href="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/96/01/MosaicQ.jpg">Show Hubble Deep Field slide</a>]
The Hubble Space Telescope image that most excited professional astronomers was this one,
the Hubble Deep Field. Three years ago, in a wonderful act of generosity and wisdom, the
director of the Hubble Space Telescope saved his annual discretionary viewing time to devote it
to a 10-day observation of this one tiny patch of sky near the Big Dipper. This is the deepest
astronomical image ever taken up to that time. While the Hubble has much less light-collecting
power than a large ground-based telescope, its flight above the atmosphere removes all
terrestrial light pollution as well as natural sky glow. The result is a much lower level of
interfering background light and therefore a capacity to see fainter objects. Virtually every one
of the several thousand objects seen here is a distant galaxy comparable to the entire Milky
Way or its nearby neighbors. <P>

For me, this image has powerful spiritual appeal even though it is clearly less aesthetically
pleasing than the Eagle Nebula. It is an example of knowledge increasing wonder. By looking
at the fainter galaxies, we are seeing further than ever before. This photograph is the
astronomical counterpart of a geological core sample obtained by drilling through the earth. Our
telescopic view has drilled nearly through the visible universe. <P>

To this story we must add the fact that light doesn’t travel at infinite speed. You may have
experienced the slight transmission delay of trans-continental telephone calls routed through
geosynchronous communications satellites. It takes a little over eight minutes for light to reach
us from the sun. Light from the most distant galaxies takes more than ten billion years to reach
us. We also know, thanks to Edwin Hubble’s discovery seventy years ago and the work of his
successors, that galaxies recede from each other and must have been set in motion in a cosmic
explosion, the Big Bang, about twelve billion years ago. That’s not long before the light was
sent to our eyes from the most distant galaxies in this image. <P>

The Hubble Deep Field shows us galaxies in their early stages of assembly from coalescing
fragments of the Big Bang. It shows us a galactic nursery. But superimposed on this are older
galaxies in their youth and mature galaxies more or less like our own. The history of galaxies is
recorded here, if only we can unravel it. Ten billion years, one hundred trillion stars, and how
many civilizations are in this image? In the words of the Psalmist, "O Lord, our sovereign, how
majestic is your name in all the earth!" <P>

[<a href="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/41/content/9841bw.jpg">Show Southern Hubble
Deep Field slide</a>]
Last year the Hubble Space Telescope was refurbished during a space shuttle mission to
replace and improve its instrumentation. Last fall, another long exposure was taken, this time
with the telescope pointed south of the equator. New instruments allowed images to be taken in
the infrared and ultraviolet parts of the light spectrum, extending the scientific utility of the data. <P>

The lower left-hand image is from a ground-based telescope and shows the fields of view of
the Hubble instruments. The upper left-hand image was taken using the Hubble’s
light-dissecting ultraviolet imaging spectrograph. It is dominated by the light of a quasar, a rare
but powerful beacon in the center of a distant galaxy caused by the the copious inflow of
matter into a black hole perhaps a billion times as massive as our sun. Although no light can
escape from a black hole, as matter swirls in it is heated and emits a significant percentage of
all its rest-mass energy before being swallowed by the hole. More luminous than the galaxy
surrounding it, this quasar provides a beacon against which shadows are cast by wispy clouds
of gas. Analysis of these results may help to sort out the jumbled superposition of galaxies
along the line of sight. <P>

The lower right-hand picture is from Hubble’s new near-infrared camera. It is especially useful
in identifying galaxies that are so far away that the Doppler effect has stretched their light
beyond the red end of the visible spectrum. Finally, the upper right-hand picture is similar to the
northern Hubble Deep Field, confirming and extending those from the earlier snapshot. <P>

Altogether, these results from the Hubble Space Telescope are revolutionizing astronomy, and
they may have significance for our broader view of the universe and ourselves. However, a
cautious outsider may wish to take heed when a cosmologist waxes about the grandeur of the
heavens.
[Show Harris slide: "Trying to describe the size of the Big Bang."] <p>

Before leaving space astronomy, I would like to reflect on something closer to home. Or rather,
I wish to consider our home itself, in an enlarged scientific and spiritual view. <P>

[<a href="http://pao.gsfc.nasa.gov/gsfc/images/spacesci/milkyway.gif">Show DIRBE slide of the
Milky Way</a>]
Taken with an infrared camera on NASA’s Cosmic Background Explorer satellite in 1990, this
image shows our very own galaxy, the Milky Way. Infrared light passes through the haze of
obscuring dust to reveal our galaxy’s symmetry and beauty as never seen before. I love this
picture so much that I have it framed in my kitchen. My distant ancestors were able to see the
glowing band of the Milky Way at night after dinner. So am I. It is still a spiritual experience. <P>

<H4>Astronomy and Spirituality</H4>

In this tour through ancient and modern cosmology I’ve tried to convince you of the spiritual
aspect of the night sky environment. Yet spiritual experiences are deeply personal, and
ultimately it is each of us who must determine the value of a clear sky, a delicate flower, or a
rare and endangered bird. Before addressing broader spiritual and religious themes, I’d like to
share one more personal experience with the stars. <P>

[<a href="http://ftp.seds.org/pub/images/deepspace/messier/m31.gif">Show slide of M31</a>]
This is a photograph of the nearest galaxy larger than our own, the Andromeda galaxy. During
the fall and early winter, I love to look up after driving home, or when going out in the evening,
to search for this object. Although one cannot see the spiral arms or even the disk without a
telescope, it is easy to see the diffuse nebula close to the great square of Pegasus. No matter
that it is just a faint blur to our eyes. It fills me with awe to see the furthest object visible to the
naked eye, two million light years distant. The light we see was emitted before humans walked
the earth. Roughly twice as many stars as in the Milky Way galaxy are contained in this image.
Seeing it with my heart and mind as well as my eyes, I am humbled. <P>

As an undergraduate in the 1970s, I lost my religious faith and I didn’t find it again until I
became a father. But the familiar, comforting stars of my childhood always inspired awe.
Perhaps my spiritual experiences with the stars maintained a place for the Holy Spirit to act
once I was ready. <P>

Even more powerfully, Vincent Van Gogh found in the stars a pathway to solace for his
tortured soul, writing, "I have … a terrible need … shall I say the word? … of religion. Then I
go out at night and paint the stars." <P>

I believe that our wonder of the heavens is really telling us something much closer to home,
something about ourselves. In his Four Quartets, T.S. Eliot wrote, "We shall not cease from
exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the
place for the first time."
[<a href="http://www-hpcc.astro.washington.edu/mirrors/nineplanets/gif/Earthbig.jpg">Show
slide of the earth</a>] <P>

Our experiences of awe, whether from the stars, a Bach fugue or a coral reef, point to
transcendence, to an evaluation of humanity’s place in a created universe incomprehensibly
greater than our daily rituals. To me as a scientist, it is amazing and wonderful that knowledge
builds appreciation, appreciation leads to awe, awe leads faith, and faith, to grace and peace.
Vannevar Bush wrote, "Science here does things. It renders us humble and it paints a universe
in which the mysteries become highlighted, in which constraints on imagination and speculation
have been removed, and which becomes ever more awe-inspiring as we gaze … on the
essential and central core of faith." <P>

Sir John Marks Templeton has championed the dialogue of science and religion, arguing that
the humility taught by scientific knowledge advances theology. In his book The Humble
Approach, he writes, "Let us humbly admit how very small is the measure of men’s minds.
This realization helps to prevent religious conflicts, and obviates attacks by atheists against
religion. Moreover, humility of this kind opens more minds to the idea that science supports and
illuminates religion." <P>

[<a href="http://encke.jpl.nasa.gov/images/96B2/96B2_960322_gg1.gif">Show slide of the
starry sky</a>]
According to Christianity, God humbled himself by sending his son to our world to teach, to live
and to die on the cross as our redeemer. Humility is an underrated virtue. Let us preserve the
sanctuary of night for our children as a place to experience the wonders of creation and the
creation of wonder, the grace of humility and the humility of grace. <P>
