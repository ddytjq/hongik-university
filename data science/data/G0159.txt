<b> 2.1 Graphics file formats</b><p>

We had to keep two types of users in mind when selecting the
appropriate file type to store the images in the catalog. First, we
had to store the data in the usual FITS format so that scientists can
take full advantage of the pictures. We also had to select a format -
for non-professionals - that does not require special software to
display and takes considerably less time to download over slow
network connections.

<p>

Our goal in publishing this catalog is to provide scientific-quality
data for astronomers who may find these galaxy images useful for
research or teaching purposes.  The <a
href="http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_intro.html">FITS file format</a>
(Flexible Image Transport System) is the <i>de facto</i> standard for
image and data interchange among astronomers worldwide. It was
designed to make data transport easy from one machine to another. FITS
files consist of header keys and binary data.  Several data types are
supported, 8-, 16-, and 32-bit integer, plus 32- and 64-bit floating
point numbers. Our catalog images are stored in 16-bit twos-complement
signed binary integer format. Header keys specify the pixel-resolution
of the image, the data type, some information about the actual
observation, including the date, time, telescope, camera, observer,
filter used, integration time, and coordinates of the object. Also
recorded are information about the data: the sky level, the sky sigma,
minimum and maximum values in the pixels; as well as extra information
about the target galaxy, among others: the Hubble type, size,
orientation on the sky, and distance. For more details see the <a
href="cat_ug_3.htm#header">section 3</a> of this User Guide or the
<a href="cat_ajp.htm">AJ paper</a> published about this catalog.

<p>

We also think that the galaxy images in this catalog can be
interesting for a wider audience.  Some people who want to use the
data may not have access to image analyzer programs with FITS
capabilities. We decided to provide the catalog images in a format
that can be readily used on most personal computers: Macintoshes, or
IBM PC compatible machines, or any kind of a UNIX system. The two
file formats generally supported are GIF and JPEG, one of the two
formats being better for one or another application.

<p>

Our FITS files contain 16 bits of information per pixel, therefore we
can represent 65,536 shades of grey between black and white in these
pictures. Although we do not use the total possible range, many images
cover more than 10,000 levels of grey. To present the same image in the
GIF or JPEG format, we have to transform these images so that they
will not use more than 256 levels of grey. This number is the limit
for both file formats. JPEG is a "true" color format: the red, green,
and blue components take up 8 bits each, providing the 24 bits/pixel
color information. However, to make a shade of grey, the brightness in
all three channels must be the same. This means that the maximum
number of grey levels one can achieve is only 256. GIF is based on
indexed color. There is a palette of 256 colors in the file, and one of
these colors is assigned to each pixel in the picture.  Obviously,
even if all the palette colors are shades of grey, the maximum number
of greys is 256. See the discussion <a href="#lut">below</a> on
how to reduce the 16 bits/pixel information in the FITS files to 8
bits/pixel for storage in the GIF or JPEG format.

<p>

To store and reproduce information in a picture, the <a
href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/%7Emxr/gfx/2d-hi.html">GIF file
format</a> utilizes a lossless compression algorithm. If we start out
with a file that has only 256 colors, GIF can compress and fully
restore such a picture. GIF is not intended for color photographs
because of the 256-color limitation, and because it cannot compress
photographs into a sufficiently small file.  GIF is much better with
line art, charts, or drawings: 256 colors are usually sufficient, and
compression is much better.

<p>

JPEG is a lossy compression. The method is designed to compress color
photographs (24 bits/pixel) into a small file, and reproduce the image
so that the losses are not apparent to the observer. A color
photograph can be compressed to a much smaller size with the JPEG
algorithm than with GIF, and it is hard to find apparent losses in the
restored picture.  Some information is available about <a
href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/jpeg-faq/top.html">JPEG
image compression</a> - in the form of <i>Frequently Asked
Questions</i> - on the Web.

<p>

Based on the above discussion it is evident that color-composite
images in this catalog should be stored in JPEG format. GIF could not
store all the colors nor could it provide a small file for quick
downloads. In JPEG, during compression, a quality index can be
specified.  A low index will result in a very small file, but possibly
with apparent losses. A higher index will make a larger file, but
image quality will be better. We used index 75 percent to compress our
color images since many experts agree that above the 75 percent
quality index, improvements in image quality are hardly noticeable.

<p>

For our grey-scale pictures the GIF format is actually better than the
JPEG format. GIF <i>can</i> represent 256 grey levels, and JPEG can
not do better.  On the other hand, GIF is lossless, JPEG is lossy. It
is true that GIFs of these images will be larger files than JPEGs, so
we decided to provide both on the Web. If you want to take a quick
look at a grey-scale picture, a JPEG file will download three times
faster than a GIF, but if you want to be sure that you got all the
information (whatever remained after the FITS file was transformed
from 16 bits/pixel to 8 bits/pixel), GIF will serve you this
information. On the CD-ROM, where download time is not an issue, GIFs
are always the better choice, but JPEGs are still there so that you do
not have to convert them if you need to use them in that format.

<p>

Typical file sizes in the catalog are as follows: FITS: 200kb to 1Mb,
GIF: 30kb to 500kb, JPEG: 10kb to 130kb and color JPEG: 5kb to 100kb.
Color JPEGs are smaller files than grey-scale JPEGs since the
background sky was set to black in color files (these large black
regions compress well), while the sky is a bit noisy (you can see some
detail) in the grey-scale images.  The 257 FITS files take up about
85Mb; GIFs are about 27Mb, the 257 grey-scale JPEG pictures are 10Mb,
and the 113 color-composite JPEGs are 3Mb in total.

&nbsp;<br>
<b> 2.2 Image viewers on various computers</b><p>

Perhaps you already have an appropriate viewing program installed on
your computer that you can use to display the galaxy images on your
screen.  In case you need them, executable files - and occasionally
source code - can be obtained from the locations we list here.  You
may not find some of the links active after a certain period of time,
but you will be able to locate these programs without trouble, using
common search engines on the Web.

<p>

The <a href="http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/">FITS Support Office</a>,
operated under the guidance of the Astrophysics Data Facility at the
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, provides information on image
viewing and manipulation programs. Software has been developed to
read and write FITS files in Fortran or C. The <a
href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html">FITSIO
package</a> contains routines that can be incorporated into software
systems, or simple image display programs.

<p>

All major astronomical image processing packages support the FITS file
format: the <a href="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/aips/">Astronomical Image
Processing System</a> (AIPS), developed by the National Radio
Astronomy Observatory (NRAO); the European Southern Observatory's <a
href="http://http.hq.eso.org/midas-info/midas.html">Munich Image and
Data Analysis System</a> (MIDAS), and the <a
href="http://iraf.noao.edu/">Image Reduction and Analysis Facility</a>
(IRAF), which is from the National Optical Astronomy Observatories
(NOAO).

<p>

Software written in <a href="http://www.rsinc.com/">IDL</a>, the
<i>Interactive Data Language</i>, to read and write FITS files is also
available as part of the IDL <a
href="http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/homepage.html">Astronomy User's
Library</a>. Native FITS support is also available in <a
href="http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/saoimage.html">SAOimage</a>,
and the new version, SAOtng (SAOimage: The Next Generation), of the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.

<p>

There is a stand-alone program to display FITS files, <i><a
href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/ftools/fv.html">fv</a></i>.
This software is part of the <a
href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/ftools/ftools_menu.html">FTOOLS</a>
package. <a href="http://www.trilon.com/xv/">XV</a> also supports the
FITS format. The <a href="ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/">Extended Portable
Bitmap Toolkit</a> (PBMPLUS) can convert FITS files to many other file
formats. Since they were not intended originally for FITS
manipulation, both XV and PBMPLUS should be used with some
caution. FITS files can store information in the header keys that
sophisticated image processing packages use to extract pixel-data and
display images with the correct look-up-table to show as much visual
detail as possible.  We converted FITS files to GIF and JPEG files
with a software that reads the header keys. These files are included in
this catalog, and these, rather than the FITS originals should be
viewed with XV or similar packages to obtain the best result. <a
href="http://www.gimp.org/index.html">GIMP</a> has a plug-in to import
FITS files.

<p>

<a href="ftp://fits.cv.nrao.edu/fits/os-support/dos/">IMDISP</a> and
<a
href="ftp://fits.cv.nrao.edu/fits/os-support/ms-windows/fitsview/">FITSview</a>
run on IBM PC compatible computers. FITSview is also available for
Macintosh and UNIX platforms.  Macintosh software include <a
href="ftp://fits.cv.nrao.edu/fits/os-support/mac-os/macfitsview/">MacFITSview</a>
and an extension to <a
href="http://www.lemkesoft.de/us_gcabout.html">GraphicConverter</a>,
which can be used to convert FITS files to other formats.

<p>

Since GIF and JPEG files are much easier to display than FITS files,
we have provided them here. Although the above list of programs
capable of displaying FITS files is extensive, those programs are
mainly for UNIX workstations, which are complicated software systems,
and are not usually installed on an IBM PC or a Macintosh.
GIF and JPEG viewers, however, are certainly there already.

are available. We cannot guarantee that we included all possible
software, or your personal favorite. Our intention was only to give a
starting point.

<p>

Both major Web browser software, <a
href="http://home.netscape.com/">Netscape</a> and <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/default.asp">Internet Explorer</a>,
support GIF and JPEG natively, and one of these browsers surely is
already installed on most computers these days. This gives the
easiest opportunity to browse through the GIF and JPEG images in
this galaxy catalog.

<b> 2.3 Look-up-table generation for the GIF and JPEG images</b><p>

CCD devices record a wide range of brightness levels, usually more
than 10,000 shades of grey in our images. CCDs are linear devices, whose
resulting picture stores information proportional to the flux of light
arriving from a distant object. Computer monitors usually cannot
display more than 256 shades of grey, and they are non-linear (the
brightness of the pixel on the monitor is not linearly proportional to
the brightness stored in our CCD-recorded files). We have to convert
images for optimal viewing.

<p>

Computer monitors, like televisons, use Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs),
which do not produce light intensities proportional to the input
voltage. The brightness of a pixel equals the input voltage raised to
a certain power, which we call <i>gamma</i>. CRT gamma is around 2.5,
which is due to the physical design of the electron gun.  TVs are
corrected for gamma before the signal is broadcasted. Some computers,
like SGIs, correct for gamma in the monitor hardware. Macintosh gamma
is corrected so that gamma is 1.8; the system is still very much
non-linear, but matches closely the "gamma" of laser printers. Because
of dot-gain, printers have the same artifact: ink spreads on the
paper, and the resulting dot is usually larger than intended. The size
is a non-linear function of the information sent to the printer. By
setting Macintosh gamma to be the same as the printers' gamma, a
document displayed on the screen will look very similar when printed.

<p>

Many UNIX machines and PC computers do not adjust for gamma at all.
Due to the great number of these machines, pictures intended for
Web-use are usually corrected for gamma=2.2, this being an "average"
gamma considering the uncorrected (gamma=2.5) and slightly corrected
Macintosh (gamma=1.8) systems. We adopted the same value when
converting our pictures from the 16 bits/pixel FITS format to the
256-shades-of-grey GIF and JPEG formats. Effective gamma in a dimly
lit room with an uncorrected CRT is actually closer to 2.2 than to
2.5. On a Macintosh it may be possible to change the system gamma (and
we suggest to set it to 2.2 if our pictures appear a bit bright).
Adobe Photoshop, for example, comes with a Knoll gamma corrector.

<p>

Gamma correction is a simple task: we have to raise all picture
intensities to the power of 1/gamma. This will make darker regions of
our galaxy images appear relatively brighter, and bright
galaxy-centers appear relatively dimmer, which allows the large
dynamic range of the galaxy to be presented in a form where all parts
of the galaxy are detailed enough even when using only 256 shades of
grey. In the process we had to set a lower and an upper threshold in
each image. All pixels darker than the lower threshold should be
black, and all pixels above the upper threshold should be white. Gamma
correction was done between these two cutoffs.

<p>

We adjusted the lower cutoff so that the background sky is black, and
the upper cutoff so that the brightest parts of the galaxy saturate to
white. The lower cutoff was set to the sky level plus 0.2 times the
sigma of the sky. Thus the background pixels are black, and only a few
are slightly brighter. We chose this cutoff so that all parts of the
galaxy are visible. Even the darkest regions close to the edge of
galaxies should be brighter than this threshold and are made visible
by the gamma correction (and a <a href"#monitor>proper setting</a> of
your monitor's black level and picture; see below). The lower cutoff
was set to sky plus 0.7 times the sigma of sky in case of the color
JPEG images. Color images are for show only, and a slightly higher
setting results in a "cleaner" picture (gamma correction can make
ugly, colorful, saturated pixels out of the random noise in the sky).

<p> 

Upper cutoff was set to half the maximum value found in the picture,
or to the sky plus 50 times the sigma of the sky, whichever is
lower. Almost all images turned out to be converted well by our
automatic procedure. Only 17 of them had to be adjusted slightly,
interactively. Five (NGC 2541, NGC 4242, NGC 4861, NGC 5204, and NGC
5334) showed too much noise in the background, so we corrected them by
increasing the value of the lower cutoff (to sky plus 0.7-0.9 times
sigma). Twelve (NGC 2903, NGC 3031, NGC 3368, NGC 3486, NGC 4258, NGC
4593, NGC 4826, NGC 5033, NGC 5055, NGC 5377, NGC 5701, and NGC 6384)
were dark at the outskirts, so we lowered the lower cutoff, even at the
expense of making the sky a bit noisy to make all the faint parts of
the galaxies visible (the lower cutoff was usually set to sky minus
0.5 times sigma).

<p>
<a name="monitor"></a> &nbsp;<br> <b> 2.4 Adjusting your
monitor</b><p>

To take full advantage of the total dynamic range stored in our
picture files you must maximize the contrast ratio of your
monitor. You should try to make black as dark as possible, and white
as bright as possible.  Obviously, black pixels cannot be presented
any darker than the darkness of the picture tube when the monitor is
turned off. Still, ambient light in the room and strong reflections
can contribute to making the picture tube look considerably brighter
than it should be. Try to minimize reflections: look at the monitor
screen when turned off; look for any strong reflections and try to
correct the problem. Re-orient your monitor if necessary.  It is best
to have windows to the left or right, but not directly behind
you. Facing the window is not good either; this provides a very bright
surround.

<p>

The next step is to adjust the <i>black level</i> (sometimes called
<i>brightness</i>) of your monitor. Turn down the "contrast" as much
as possible, display a completely <a href="Uguide/black.gif">black
picture</a> on the screen (save this image and display it on the full
screen with some external program, like XV under UNIX), and adjust the
<i>black level</i>, so that the picture is really as black as
possible. However, do not set it any darker than necessary. If black
pixels show up brighter than the lowest possible brightness on you
monitor, you immediately lose contrast. If you set it very low, not
only blacks, but low grey levels will show up as black, too.

<p>

After setting the blacks as black as possible by correcting
reflection problems and adjusting the <i>black level</i>, the
next step is to adjust the <i>picture</i> (sometimes called
<i>contrast</i>) of your monitor so that white pixels show up as white
as possible. Try to display a <a href="Uguide/white.gif">white
picture</a> on your screen and start to increase <i>picture</i> until
you stop noticing any further increase in brightness.  Do not turn the
knob to any higher value!  This would wash out bright grey levels,
increase the sense of flicker, and be plain uncomfortable.

<p>

proper viewing distance, color convergence, etc, see the <a href
