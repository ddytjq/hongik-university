<h1>Moroso Motorsports Park</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Moroso Motorsports Park is a drag strip course where the drag 
strip is used for much of the course. It is 2.25 miles long and 
has two very long and fast straights. Moroso is owned by Dick 
Moroso of the Moroso racing parts fame.

<h2><a name="HistoricalNote">Historical Note</a></h2>
Moroso Motorsports Park originally was Palm Beach International. 
Dick Moroso bought the track in the early 1980s and set about 
making it more than a local dragstrip and race course. The track 
now hosts several large road racing events besides SCCA National 
and Regional racing. Saturday nights are drag racing, with many 
NHRA special events through the year. Moroso was the site of the 
Super Chevy Show in March, drawing over 100,000 spectators during 
the 3 day event, and it now runs as the All Chevy Show, run only 
by Moroso Motorsports Park. The track is also the site of much 
winter track testing for manufacturers, TV specials, and others. 
You will probably see this track on TV many times without 
realizing it.<p>

<h2><a name="GettingThere">Getting to Moroso Motorsports Park</a></h2>
Moroso Motorsports Park is located about 10 miles west of West 
Palm Beach, Florida, on the Beeline Highway 710. It is directly 
across from the Pratt Whitney plant so if no one in a gas station 
knows how to find Moroso, they will know how to find Pratt 
Whitney.<p>

<h3>From the Florida Turnpike</h3>

Get off the Turnpike at Palm Beach Gardens and go west, which 
is right at the traffic light to the end of PGA Boulevard. If you 
need food or gas, you can go straight at the light into the 
Publix shopping center. At the end of PGA, turn right and follow 
Beeline (710) to Moroso, which is on your right. Take the main 
entrance which is the second entrance. The first entrance is not 
used for road racing and is only occasionally used for drag 
racing.<p>

<h3>From the north on I-95</h3>

Get off I95 on PGA Boulevard and go west to the end of PGA 
Boulevard. At the end of PGA, turn right and follow Beeline 
(710) to Moroso, which is on your right. Take the main entrance 
which is the second entrance. The first entrance is not used 
for road racing and is only occasionally used for drag racing.<p>

<h3>From the south on I95</h3>

Get off I95 on Blue Heron and go west, which is left at the 
traffic light past Denny's and McDonald's. Go straight across 
Military Trail to Beeline Highway (710). Follow 710 about 8 miles 
to Moroso, located on the right side just past Pratt Whitney. 
Take the main entrance which is the second entrance. The first 
entrance is not used for road racing and is only occasionally 
used for drag racing. <p>

<h3>Main Entrance</h3>

The main entrance to Moroso leads to a gate. Most park on the 
right side of this road and walk to registration, as you must 
go there before entering the facility.<p>

<h2><a name="RacersGuide">A Racers' Guide to Moroso Motorsports Park</a></h2>
<h3>Impound</h3>

Impound is located at the scales near Pit In. As you leave 
the track during the race, they will direct you to impound.<p>

<h3>Tech</h3>

Tech is located in the south end of the False Grid near the 
rest rooms.<p>

<h3>False Grid</h3>

The False Grid is next to the rest rooms and entered from 
the north end only.<p>

<h3>Timing and Scoring</h3>

Timing and Scoring is located in the building marked Press 
Room upstairs near Pit Out. It is crowded and noisy and they 
prefer not to have anyone up there unless necessary.<p>

<h3>Stewards' Trailer</h3>

Stewards' Trailer is on the north side of the rest rooms.<p>

<h3>Control/Chief Steward</h3>

Control and the Chief Steward are located upstairs next to 
Timing and Scoring in the building marked Press Room near 
Pit Out. <p>

<h3>Sound Control</h3>

Sound Control takes its readings from the north end of the 
False Grid outside the track.<p>


<h2><a name="WorkersGuide">A Worker's Guide to Moroso Motorsports Park</
a></h2>

Flagging and Communications workers meet generally 1 hour to
45 minutes before green track on the track side of the False 
Grid near Pit Out. Everyone is in white and hard to miss.<p>

Virtually all workers except Registration can be found in this 
general area.<p> 

Tech is located in the south end of the False Grid. Timing 
and Scoring have already climbed into the tower, the only 
air conditioned area at the track.<p>

<h2><a name="HotLap">A Hot Lap</a></h2>
<h3>Driving the Course</h3>

Practice sessions start from the pits. Enter the pits near 
the scales and gas pumps located close to registration, but 
on the track side of the main fence.<p>

Races start from the false grid, located near the rest rooms 
and entered from the north end. The false grid then enters 
the track at Pit Out.<p>

Leaving the pits, you have a long straight with a slight esse 
curve known as turn 1. There are two very severe FIA curbs 
here that can destroy a car's front suspension at speed and 
can throw the unwary driver out of control to crash into the 
divider barrier between the front and back straights. The 
curbing on the left side should be avoided at all costs. This 
should only be taken by two abreast, never three abreast. Also 
never run out through the grass to drivers' left by turn 1. 
There is a ditch hidden be the grass that runs perpendicular to 
the track that can cause damage. <p>

After turn 1, approach turn 2 on the right under normal racing. 
Approach it on the left during a start or in heavy traffic, as 
the inside guy always wins here.turn 2 is about a 200 degree turn 
to the left. Turn 2 can be driven with a single apex or a double 
apex. If a single apex, the apex is about two thirds of the way 
around the corner, marked by an inside FIA curbing. If double 
apexing, apex early at about one fourth of the way around and 
again at two thirds the way around. Tracking all the way out 
in the middle of turn 2 will put you in the marbles so stay in 
closer.<p>

The FIA curbing has added a hazard to turn 2 in that many cars 
are too low to get back on if they go off on the outside. If you 
go off, it is better to continue around on the grass than risk 
tearing the oil pan or transmission up by driving back over the 
curb.<p>

After tracking out to drivers' right exiting turn 2, stay out 
and shoot basically straight until you are at drivers' left 
coming into turn 3. Many jump back over to drivers' left sooner 
but this wastes time by scrubbing speed. Turns 3 and 4 make a 
180 degree turn to the right. Typically it is double apexed, 
with a single apex right at turn 3 flag station and an apex at 
turn 4 flag station. the exit and trackout area of turn 4 have 
been widen for a short distance and has gator strips added. 
Most use these to help their exit speed. <p>

A medium straight approaches turn 5. Turn 5 is the first turn 
of a set of esses formed by turns 5 and 6. The apex of turn 5 
is late and near the end of the inner FIA curbing. This area 
becomes very narrow and passing is difficult, so many attempt 
to pass going into turn 5. After going back to drivers' left 
out of turn 5, stay left and make a wide sweep through turn 6. 
The apex can be earlier than you expect, but it is about the 
center of the flag station. This turn leads onto the drag strip 
and the exit area is very wide. However, apexing early can put 
you into the grass and occasionally the grass can be flooded.<p>

The drag strip is very wide and cars will be everywhere, meaning 
they forget about turn 7. This turn no longer has a flag station 
but does have a caution light to warn if turn 8 has gone yellow. 
Occasionally, a yellow flag will be given on drivers' right near 
the center divider barrier.<p>

Turn 7 is a slight bend to the left as the track exits the drag 
strip. Most consider it unimportant, but you should try to stay 
right on the drag strip so that you go through 7 straight to the 
left side rather than turning in 7.<p>

You may have to brake here for turn 8, moving to the right side 
in the little area that sweeps out into the grass. Turns 8 and 
8A are very fast and are the site of many bad accidents as there 
is no room for mistakes before you hit the embankment. Do not 
brake in this area. Keep all four wheels on the course. Passing 
here is awkward. Before this area was widen, mistakes could mean 
a ride over the embankment and into the canal. In the Corvette, 
I am around 135 mph at this point.<p>

A medium straight leads to turn 9, a right hand turn that is very 
deceptive. Turn 9 exit is in the staging area of the drag strip 
and is very wide. Most think 9 is a 90 degree right but it 
actually bends farther around. Brake hard going in and apex late. 
You should tack out about to the second telephone pole and aim 
the car at the turn 10 flag station. You want to be as far to 
the left as possible so that you can straighten the run at turn 10 
and the front straight as much as possible. The drift of the car 
should make you miss turn 10 station but you should hit the gator 
strips on the inside and then on the outside at the trackout point 
if you are on the line.<p>

<h3>Unusual Dangers</h3>

If by chance you manage to get over a wall into a canal, much 
more rare now than once, you need to keep strapped in unto the car 
stops. Keep your helmet on and closed and unstrap your belts. Get 
out of the car and go straight up. There are divers at the track 
where this is most likely to happen and chances are they will be 
there before you get out.<p>

These canals are deep, anywhere from 9 to 12 feet, and they do 
have alligators in them. Usually, the car splashing in scares 
them away, but don't waste time in the water. Get out.<p>

<h3>In the Rain</h3>

Several sections of the track flood. With the additional 
concrete aprons and curbings, the apexes of many turns now 
flood and hold water. Let your line stay wide and drive slower 
the first few laps until you know where the flooded sections 
are. The dragstrip has many pools of water that collect and 
you may see cars skipping around to avoid them. Turn 8 apex 
floods. Turn 10 apex floods. <p>

Much of the grassy run off areas flood and you can get stuck. 
It is far better to slow down than to chance going off track.<p>

<h3>Hotels & Motels</h3>

There are several motels in the area near I95 from PGA Boulevard 
down to Blue Heron. Winter months you are competing with winter 
"snowbirds" and tourists so prices will be high. Also, reservations 
are a must in winter. <p>

Several motels have discounts for racers at Moroso. Ask if the 
motel has the discount for Moroso Motorsports Park, not SCCA. <p>
