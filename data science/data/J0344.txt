We frequenty get asked many questions by webmasters before they join us, hopefully we can answer a few of these
here, however if there is anything you are unsure of, send us an email <a href="mailto:forums@worldmotorsport.com">forums@worldmotorsport.com</a>,
and if you are thinking that the forums couldn't fit in with your site because of a certain aspect then don't because the forums are as customisable as they would be 
if the ran and hosted them.
<p>
<p>
<b>Whats this all about? </b><br>
Motorsport Forums allows motorsport webmasters to have a popular, active discussion forum on your website without the need to install any software or spend time building up a user base. The forums are capable of adapting their 'look and feel' to the style of your site. In fact even the page you are reading now utilises this technology.
<p>
<b>Why would I want a forum on my site?</b><br> 
What every web site needs is a reason to keep your visitors coming back again and again. Many sites provide excellent content but users will only visit every so often, however a discussion forum will mean that users will often come back to your site every day or more in order to continue their participation in the discussions going on. 
<p>
<b>What does it cost me / whats in it for you?</b> <br>
All it costs you is the time taken to provide a link from your website, we are not doing this to make mega-money but rather because we want to!. The adverts which run on the forums help us to get back some of the server costs associated with running the system. 
<p>
<b>Do I have to provide a link back to Motorsport Forums</b><br>
By default forum designs will come with the 'forums provided by' link. However this is entirely optional and can be removed, your forums do not have to have any links back to the main site whatsoever, or any mention of this page at all.
<p>
<b>What do you mean by 'look and feel', how customisable are the forums.</b><br>
Bascially the forums are customisable in the same number of ways as you would be able to customise a forum that was dedicated to your website, take a look at the list of our members forums <a href="partner.php">here</a> to see how they are being used. 
<p>
<b>Can I run my own advertising </b><br>
Tou may run a banner advert at the bottom of the forums, however we request that at least one advertising space is reserved for us. 
<p>
<b>What address would my forums have? </b><br>
The usual way to use the forums is to link to http://sitename.motorsportforum.com/ where sitename is the name of your site. However if your host allows you to alter the settings for your domain name you could use e.g. http://forums.sitename.com/ 
<p>
<b>I don't have enough time to look after a forums system </b><br>
This is why these forums are ideal for you we have many sites using the forums system whos webmasters would rather get on with the business of running a good website rather than a forum. Our team of moderators / administrators look after the forums and make sure there are no abusive posts etc. The minimum work that is required on your part is to link to the forums. 
<p>
<b>My site is about xxxx, I don't want all the other forums. </b><br>
No problem. We can configure your URL to take your users directly into the forum most appropriate for your site, many of our sites use this feature. 
<p>
<b>My site is about xxxx and yyyy can I just use some of the forums </b><br>
Again the answer is yes, the software is capable of selecting a subset of forums for display on your site, the best example of this is <a href="http://www.rallyforum.com">http://www.RALLYforum.com/ </a>
<p>
<b>I have an existing forums system will I lose all my old posts and will my users have to reregister. </b><br>
If you are currently using the Ultimate Bulletin Board then the answer is no. We have an import tool which will take all your posts and member information and integrate them with our board, the only difference your members would find is with more posts and an improved interface. 
<p>
If you are using another type of system we can also import your posts into our forums system, contact us to discuss this. 
<p>
<b>What sort of server are the forums running on. </b><br>
The forums use PHP and a mySQL database backend, making it one of the fastest on the market, they run on a 500Mhz Dual Pentium III server with 1GB RAM. 
<p>
<b>My site covers an area of motorsport that doesn't currently have a forum </b><br>
If you contact us we can discuss the possibility of creating a new forum to suit your requirements. 
<p>
<b>Can I be a moderator? </b><br>
The question is, do you have the time. We accept moderators on the boards who can access them at least once a day and have a pro active role in providing knowlegable input to the discussions going on in your forum as well as being prepared to take action if inappropriate posts appear. 
<p>
That being said however you can, by arrangement, have moderator type powers enabled for your login if you just wish to secure your own sites interests 
<p>
<b>How to I get the forums on my site? </b><br>
Very simply. Just send an email to <a href="mailto:forums@worldmotorsport.com">forums@worldmotorsport.com</a> with the URL of your website and we'll put together a forums system for you, alternatively fill out the form <a href="partner.php">here</a> If you want to specify any special requirements then you can do so at this time or at any time after this. Your users can be discussing the latest topics in the forums within 24 hours.
