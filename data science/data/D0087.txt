<b>New in 0.11 released 2002-06-19:

<ul>
<li> Added missing AWT stubs.
<li> Correct the version number printed from 'japhar'.  Use our version
  number, not the one from libffi.
<li> Fixed runtime SIGSEGV during initialization caused by const globals now
  being write protected on Linux.
<li> Corrected stack creation, making sure the topframe is a valid frame
  (and not behid the last valid frame).
<li> Upgraded libtool parts to v1.6.1 and automake parts to 1.4.2.
<li> Fix autodetection of NSPR on Debian.
<li> Now allocates enough memory when storing the class path.
</ul>

<b>New in 0.10 released 2001-05-27:

<ul>
<li>Fixes to exception handling in JNI code.
<li>Correct stack trace printing.
<li>Added missing liboji/japharSecureEnv.h to distribution.
<li>./configure now finds NSPR on Debian 2.2 automatically.
<li>Removed some warnings.
</ul>

<b>New in 0.09 released 2000-09-17:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Exception machinery should be much quicker - no more checking for an
  exception after every opcode (heh - i can't believe that code lasted
  this long).
<li>Major, major, MAJOR API CHANGES.  All the externally visible API has
  been moved to one header (runtime.h).  It has a flavor similar to KNI
  and JNI, and provides a lower level and sometimes more efficient means
  of dealing with japhar.
<li>Moved to NSPR exclusively for portability reasons.  The only remaining
  piece from the arch/ directory is the libtool ltdl stuff.
<li>virtual and interface methods are now stored in per class vtables.
  this should speed up both lookup and invocation substantially.
<li>the object representation has been changed (again :) to be more
  efficient in time and space.
<li>BeOS patches from Chris and Makoto Kato <m_kato@ga2.so-net.ne.jp>.
<li>bug fixes in the iushr and lushr instructions.  fixes mauve double
  and float tests.
<li>error condition work in System.arraycopy and the java.net functions.
  fixes more mauve tests.
<li>Win32 and Solaris patches.
<li>Upgraded libtool to version 1.3.5
<li>Using libtool ltdl for DLL handling.
<li>Removed ununsed configure param --with-classpath
</ul>

<b>New in 0.08 released 1999-03-15:</b><br>
<ul>
<li> audio now works if you have a reasonably configured /dev/audio.
<li> loads of awt changes.  appletviewer is displaying useful stuff, very close
  to the 1.1 appletviewer.  1.2 awt is still far off.
<li> swing 1.1.1 stuff (using a JDK1.1.7 classes.zip file) is starting to show
  up! :)  check out the images on www.japhar.org.
<li> we're now running mauve against japhar, and will periodically update the
  page as we test more things (and fix more problems).
<li> Slight changes to the GC interface that make it easier for GC's to keep
  state around.
<li> Exceptions now work properly.  fillInStackTrace and printStackTrace work
  as expected.
<li> JDK1.2 support is coming on line - All the JDK1.2 utilities give
  usage messages when run now.
<li> the Inflater stuff is finally working, so jar tvf will give reasonable
  output.
<li> A binary search is made to find classes in .zip/.jar files now, which
  should result in a bit of a speedup.
<li> switched to automake version 1.4.
<li> Endianness/alignment fixes contributed from Christophe Lizzi.
<li> The configure script is now more intelligent.  use the --with-jdk switch
  to specify a JDK distribution directory.  You can use either a 1.1.x or
  1.2 distribution (or not specify one at all.)
<li> gcc specific optimization in libruntime (-finline-functions) results in
  rather large (~2 second) difference in typical execution time of javac
<li> dump-class is dead.  it's functionality has been rolled into japharh.
</ul>

<b>New in 0.07 released 1999-01-28:</b><br>
<ul>
<li> Garbage collection is being worked on again.  So far, we've vtable'ized the
  JVM's interface to the collector, and have started work on one (for use
  in Mozilla.)
<li> libffi is now used on supported platforms.  Stubs aren't generated (and
  aren't used) on those platforms.
<li> squashed a nasty bug -- the only one remaining (that I know of) that keeps
  javac from working some instances.
<li> The Motif/Lesstif AWT is now partly working
<li> Classpath integration patches
</ul>
<b>New in 0.06 released 1998-09-29:</b><br>
<ul>
<li> Big News!  Japhar is now able to build a mozilla OJI plugin.  We're the 
  first free JVM to do it :)
<li> Reflection should now be working.
<li> jclass's are now jobjects and not ClazzFile*'s
<li> lots of stuff is inlined, and the interpreter loop is now a switch 
  statement, not made up of different functions.
<li> we now handle mangled names for overloaded native methods.
<li> throw OutOfMemoryError in various places instead of proceeding (and
  often crashing.)
<li> throw ClassCastException in op_checkcast when it's correct to do so,
  and fix it to handle arrays properly.
<li> All java.net native methods should now be implemented
</ul>
<p>
<b>New in 0.05 released 1998-06-22:</b><br>
<ul>
<li> --with-dmalloc now enables dmalloc.
<li> dump-class and japharh now using getopt.
<li> new object representation is in, which is more efficient in both
  space and time.
<li> Bugfix in opcodes
<li> Some JNI improvements
<li> Started on Win32 support.
<li> Started on documentation.
<li> Plugged some memory leaks.
<li> Better thread support (implemented more native methods)
<li> Improved handling of .jar and .zip files.
</ul>
<p>
<b>New in 0.04 released 1998-04-23:</b><br>
<ul>
<li> Added support for Netscape's NSPR library.  enable it using
  --enable-nspr when configuring.
<li> The JNIEnv pointers are now handled properly -- native methods
  now use (*env)-&gt;Function instead of (*env-&gt;Function).
<li> Japhar is now distributed under the LGPL.  Well, it's libraries are LGPL'ed
  and the example uses of japhar (the japhar interpreter, japharh, and 
  dump-class) are distributed under the GPL.
<li> Due to licensing foo in Sun's JDK distribution, you have to have your
  own copy of JDK1.1.5 to configure japhar.  use --with-sun-jdk=&lt;path&gt; to
  tell japhar where it is.  It'll slurp out the stuff it needs.
  Please make sure it's 1.1.5, or you're going to be in a world of pain.
  Do not copy or link the classes archive from japhar-0.3 or previous
  distributions.
</ul>
<p>
<b>New in 0.03 released 1998-03-31:</b><br>
<ul>
<li> libtool-1.2 and automake-1.2h are being used now.
<li> squashed a *nasty* bug dealing with the operand stack's top pointer
  not being restored to the correct value when we pop a stack frame.
<li> javac now prints out a usage message when run with no arguments.
<li> Runs on Solaris 2.5
<li> Bugfix in network and file code 
<li> Removed some memory leaks
<li> Now using GNU getopt
<li> Skip unknown class attributes instead of crashing
<li> lib/libjvmdi is now present (in all it's incomplete glory :)
</ul>
<p>
<b>New in 0.02 released 1998-03-28:</b><br>
<ul>
<li> We've learned a bit more about automake in this release, so the testsuite
  should be working.
<li> Bugfixes in the socket code
<li> Changed how to find runtime classes.  Now looks thru
  $prefix/japhar/share/ adding all .jar files it finds.
<li> Fixed problem with missing -lSM and -lICE when not linking with X11
<li> Some speedup in method resolving
<li> Some 64bit cleaning
<li> Fixed behavior of GetObjectClass for native methods.
<li> More motif awt work.
</ul>
<p>
<b>New in 0.01:</b><br>
<ul>
<li> Japhar now comes with native methods and a classes.jar file
  from JDK 1.1.5.
<li> we now include the JDK's properties files.
<li> This release incorporates Petter's dejagnu testsuite.  Check
  the README for more information.
<li> Numerous native method bugs fixed.
<li> Changed stack frames from being malloc/free'ed to
  being carved out of a per-thread malloc'ed area that's
  only malloced when the thread is initially created.  Should
  speed things up.
<li> filled in native methods for java/lang/SecurityManager.
<li> addition of stubbed out libnative/sun.debug.agent.
<li> work on sun.awt.motif is proceeding.  appletviewer pops up
  windows, but doesn't even come close to working yet.
</ul>
<p>
<b>New in 0.0:</b><br>
<ul>
<li> First release of japhar code (version 0.0).
