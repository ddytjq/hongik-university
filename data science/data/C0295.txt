              per share. Chaucer has also entered into a conditional agreement 
              with BRIT Insurance Holdings PLC (&#147;BRIT&#148;) for the acquisition 
              (&#147;the Acquisition&#148;) of BRIT's interest in Chaucer Dedicated

              by the issue to BRIT of 5,650,000 Consideration Shares at 60p per

              general meeting (&#147;EGM&#148;) to be held on 2 April 2001 to 
              seek shareholder approval, is being posted to shareholders today.</p>
            <p><b>Placing and Open Offer</b></p>
            <p>Under the terms of the Open Offer, shareholders on the register 
              at 2 March 2001 (excluding overseas shareholders) (&#147;Qualifying 
              Shareholders&#148;) may apply for the Offer Shares at 60p per share

              held). The amount due in respect of each application for Offer Shares 
              is payable in full on application. Entitlements to Offer Shares 
              will be rounded down to the nearest whole Offer Share. Fractional 
              entitlements will not be allotted and will be disregarded.</p>
            <p>Certain Directors and two existing Shareholders have irrevocably 
              undertaken or otherwise agreed to apply for some or all of their 
              entitlements to Offer Shares under the Open Offer. Such commitments 
              relate to 5,127,023, or 15.3 per cent, of the Offer Shares. The 
              balance of 28,492,466, or 84.7 per cent, of the Offer Shares has 
              been conditionally placed by Numis Securities Limited (&#147;Numis&#148;)

            <p>The Directors intend that at least &pound;14 million of the net 
              proceeds of the Placing and Open Offer will be applied in providing 
              funds at Lloyd's to support the Group's underwriting on the Chaucer 
              Syndicates for the 2002 and subsequent years of account. Additionally, 
              up to &pound;4.5 million will be applied in providing additional 
              working capital to fund underwriting losses, including the share 
              of CDL losses assumed as a result of the Acquisition.</p>
            <p>In particular, the Company anticipates that the Chaucer Group will 
              require additional funds to support underwriting capacity on Syndicates 
              587 and 1096 for the 2002 year of account which it may acquire pursuant 
              to mandatory offers which the Group is required to make under Lloyd&#146;s 
              rules to the remaining members of Syndicates 587 and 1096. On the 
              basis of the Chaucer Group&#146;s current solvency ratio of 40 per 
              cent, Chaucer would require &pound;17.9 million of additional capital 
              to support all the outstanding underwriting capacity on these Syndicates 
              which the Group and CDL does not presently own. However, the amount 
              of capacity which the Group actually acquires pursuant to the mandatory 
              offers will depend upon the prices offered and the willingness of 
              the remaining syndicate members to sell their capacity. Chaucer 
              anticipates that it will also use further amounts of the net proceeds 
              of the Placing and Open Offer to support the Chaucer Group&#146;s 
              shares of planned increases in the stamp capacities of Syndicates 
              587, 1084 and 1096 (&#147;the Chaucer Syndicates&#148;) for the 
              2002 year of account.</p>
            <p>To the extent not utilised in the manner described in the preceding 
              paragraph, the Company intends to apply the net proceeds in or towards 
              replacing two reinsurance gearing policies which currently provide 
              &pound;12.5 million of funds at Lloyd's on behalf of the Group.</p>
            <p>If, as a result of the mandatory offers or otherwise, the Chaucer 
              Group were to acquire more capacity on the Chaucer Syndicates than 
              it is able to underwrite with its own funds, the Group would seek 
              alternative funding arrangements for this surplus capacity or, in 
              the absence of such funding, could choose not to underwrite the 
              surplus.</p>
            <p><b>Acquisition of BRIT's interest in Chaucer Dedicated Limited</b></p>
            <p>Chaucer has also agreed to acquire BRIT's entire interest in CDL 
              (including BRIT's participation in the open 1998, 1999, 2000 and 
              2001 years of account) for an approximate consideration of &pound;3.4 
              million which will be satisfied by the issue to BRIT of 5,650,000 
              new Chaucer shares (&#147;Consideration Shares&#148;) at 60p per 
              share.</p>
            <p>The Consideration Shares to be issued in respect of the Acquisition 
              will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing Chaucer Shares 
              save that they will not rank for the final dividend for the 12 months 
              ended 31 December 2000. It is expected that Admission of the Consideration 
              Shares will become effective and that dealings in the Consideration 
              Shares will commence on the next dealing day after the date on which 
              the Acquisition is completed.</p>
            <p>As a result of the Acquisition, CDL will retain &pound;3.8 million 
              of funds at Lloyd's currently loaned by BRIT and net assets as at 
              31 December 1999 (adjusted, inter alia, for loss provisions already 
              made in respect of the 1998 and 1999 years of account) of approximately 
              &pound;0.3 million. CDL will also retain capacity rights costing 
              approximately &pound;0.3 million which were funded by loans from 
              BRIT. For the year ended 31 December 1999, CDL reported a loss, 
              before tax, of &pound;3.6 million of which BRIT&#146;s share was 
              &pound;0.8 million. No audited accounts are available for CDL in 
              respect of any later period.</p>
            <p>Following the Acquisition, Chaucer will assume responsibility for 
              losses in respect of the 1998 and 1999 years of account attributable 
              to BRIT's interest. However, Chaucer receives, inter alia, the benefit 
              of the future tax relief expected by the Chaucer Group in respect 
              of such losses, payments already made by BRIT in respect of 1998 
              year of account losses and accrued interest on funds at Lloyd&#146;s 
              due to BRIT. Any profit or loss in respect of BRIT's participation 
              in CDL for the 2000 or 2001 year of account will also accrue to 
              Chaucer.</p>
            <p>Following the Acquisition, CDL (which is currently treated as a 
              joint venture of the Chaucer Group for accounting purposes) will 
              become consolidated in the Chaucer Group's accounts.</p>
            <p>The Acquisition is conditional, inter alia, upon shareholders' 
              approval which will be sought at the EGM, the Placing Agreement 
              becoming unconditional in accordance with its terms and Lloyd's 
              approval to the change of control of CDL. Shareholders' approval 
              for the Acquisition is required because BRIT is deemed by the Listing 
              Rules of the UK Listing Authority to be a related party to Chaucer 
              by reason of its holding of 11,886,466 Chaucer shares which constitutes 
              26.52 per cent of Chaucer's existing issued share capital.</p>
            <p>Following completion of the Acquisition and the Placing and Open 
              Offer, BRIT's shareholding in Chaucer will be a maximum of 26.8 
              per cent. In view of BRIT&#146;s shareholding in Chaucer and its 
              position as a related party of Chaucer, BRIT has undertaken not 
              to vote at the EGM on the resolution to approve the Acquisition.</p>
            <p><b>Unaudited Loss Estimate and Dividend Forecast</b></p>
            <p>The Directors estimate that the loss of the Chaucer Group for the 
              year ended 31 December 2000 will be as follows:&nbsp; <br>

            <p>Basic loss per share has been calculated on the loss after tax 
              and a weighted average number of shares in issue during the year 
              of 44.5 million (1999: 44.3 million).</p>
            <p>The estimate includes provisions for underwriting losses of &pound;2.3 
              million. These are principally provisions which the Directors consider 
              are appropriate, as a matter of prudence, in respect of the Group's 
              underwriting for the 2000 year of account and in respect of any 
              deterioration on the syndicates remaining open from the 1996 and 
              1997 years of account. It is to be emphasised that, in making the 
              provisions, no estimate or projection is being made or is to be 
              implied as to the ultimate outcome of the Group's underwriting for 
              the 2000 year of account.</p>
            <p>The unaudited loss estimate of &pound;2.8 million in respect of 
              investment losses for the year represents &pound;1.4 million of 
              realised investment losses and &pound;1.4 million unrealised losses 
              attributable to a fall in the market value of the Group's investments 
              at the year end. The realised investment losses arose as a result 
              of the sale of the Company's holding in Aberdeen UK Growth Unit 
              Trust which was referred to in the Company's interim statement for 
              the six months ended 30 June 2000. Since the year end, the Group's 
              investment portfolio has recovered to a significant extent, thereby 
              significantly reducing the unrealised losses reflected in the Group's 
              loss estimate for the year ended 31 December 2000.</p>
            <p>In the absence of unforeseen circumstances, the Directors intend 
              to recommend a final dividend of 1.0p per Chaucer Share (1999: 1.0p) 
              giving a total dividend for the year ended 31 December 2000 of 1.5p 
              per Chaucer Share (1999: 2.0p).</p>
            <p><b>Current Trading and Prospects</b></p>
            <p>The Company reported in its interim statement for the six months 
              ended 30 June 2000 that rates had improved in the motor market since 
              the end of 1998. Rates have continued to increase in the private 
              car and fleet business throughout the year 2000. There is evidence 
              that further rate increases in that business have been experienced 
              by the Chaucer Group during the current year although these increases 
              have to be viewed in the context of an expected increase in claims 
              costs and personal injury awards.</p>
            <p>The Company also reported in its interim statement that it was 
              seeing evidence of hardening rates in selective areas of the marine, 
              aviation and non-marine markets in which the Group operates. Rates 
              in both those and certain other areas in which the Group operates 
              have continued to harden during the remainder of 2000 and the beginning 
              of this year. These markets, however, remain uneven and it is too 
              early to report rate increases across all areas of the Group's business.</p>
            <p>In light of the above, the Board is cautiously optimistic of the 
              prospects of the Chaucer Group (as enlarged by the Acquisition) 
              for the current year.</p>
            <p><b>Background&nbsp;</b></p>
            <p>Chaucer is one of a number of quoted Lloyd's integrated vehicles 
              which have evolved in recent years. Integrated Lloyd's vehicles 
              now tend to trade at a premium to their net tangible asset values 
              and although this premium has narrowed in many cases (and in some 
              instances reverted to a discount), the share prices of most of the 
              quoted Lloyd's integrated vehicles are now beginning to recover 
              as the market perceives an upswing in the underwriting cycle.</p>
            <p>The managed capacity of the Chaucer Syndicates is now &pound;256.4 
              million spread across the motor, non-marine and marine sectors of 
              the Lloyd's market. All of the underwriting capacity now owned by 
              the Chaucer Group is devoted to the Chaucer Syndicates.</p>
            <p>Chaucer underwrites through its wholly-owned subsidiary ALIT (No.1) 
              Limited (&#147;ALIT&#148;) and through CDL, which have gross underwriting 
              capacities for the 2001 year of account of &pound;103.3 million 
              and &pound;60 million respectively. Of ALIT's funds at Lloyd's for 
              the 2001 year of account, &pound;14 million is provided through 
              two quota share reinsurance policies which provide &pound;35 million 
              of underwriting capacity for the 2001 year of account and a further 
              &pound;5 million is provided pursuant to a reinsurance gearing contract.</p>
            <p>Various arrangements have also been entered into with third party 
              shareholders in CDL for the provision of CDL's funds at Lloyd's 
              for the 2001 and prior years of account. Broadly stated, the Company 
              currently has an approximate 47 per cent interest in the 2001 year 
              of account results of CDL. Furthermore &pound;7.5 million of CDL&#146;s 
              funds at Lloyd&#146;s is provided pursuant to a reinsurance gearing 
              contract.</p>
            <p><b>Underwriting Capacity</b></p>
            <p><br>
              As a result of its interests in ALIT and CDL, the Chaucer Group 
              has an economic interest in &pound;96.3 million of underwriting 
              capacity on the Chaucer Syndicates for the 2001 year of account, 
              representing approximately 37.6 per cent of the aggregate capacity 
              managed by CSL as set out below:</p>

              in the capacity of the Chaucer Syndicates for the 2001 year of account 
              will increase from &pound;96.3m (37.6%) to &pound;107.0m (41.7%).</p>
            <p><b>Employee Share Schemes</b></p>

              (AESOP) under the Finance Act 2000 and a new Inland Revenue Approved 
              Share Option Scheme. The Company is also seeking to make certain 
              amendments to the Company&#146;s Unapproved Share Option and Savings 
              Related Schemes.</p>

              the existing Unapproved Share Option Scheme and exercisable at 135p 
              or 100p per share will be cancelled (subject to agreement with the 
              individual holders).</p>
            <p><b>Warrants</b></p>
            <p>Following completion of the Placing and Open Offer the exercise 
              prices of the Company&#146;s 1998 Warrants and the Company&#146;s 
              1993 Warrants will be adjusted: from 135p (currently) to 132p per 
              share for the 1998 Warrants and from 100p (currently) to 98p per 
              share for the 1993 Warrants. In addition, a total of 122,362 new 
              1993 Warrants and 64,773 new 1998 Warrants will, subject to Admission, 
              be issued to existing Warrantholders pro-rata to their existing 
              holdings of 1993 or 1998 Warrants (as the case may be).</p>
