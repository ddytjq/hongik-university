          <p>The safari capital of Tanzania, Arusha rests at the foot of Mt. Meru, 
            which at 4,556 meters (14,947 ft.) dominates the landscape as does 
            nearby Mt. Kilimanjaro. Arusha environs are very green and lush due 
            to an abundance of streams from the mountain. Just outside the city 
            the scenery changes dramatically, becoming very dry, with volcanic 
            peaks dotting the landscape. </p>
          <p>The town is the gateway to the country's most famous national parks, 
            all within a few hours to a one-day drive. Arusha itself is a very 
            pleasant small city with good roads, lots of good shopping for tourists 
            and locals alike. Hotels range from luxury to very economical and 
            clean, with a wide range of choices. Available are excellent quality 
            ebony and other wood carvings, musical instruments, batiks, weavings, 
            sculpture, spears, fabrics, handcrafted jewelry and beadwork from 
            the Maasai and other local tribal groups, semi-precious stones especially 
            tanzanite. </p>
          <p>The nearest airport to Arusha is Kilimanjaro, which offers international 
            flights from Europe and select African cities. Arusha is just a 4-hour 
            drive from Nairobi, Kenya, and it's international airport served by 
            all major international carriers. Shuttle buses from Nairobi and Nairobi's 
            JKIA airport to Arusha cost $35 each way and travel twice each day, 
            in the morning and afternoon. </p>
          <p>In addition to safaris, more adventurous runners can do the 6-day 
            Mt. Kilimanjaro climb (at 5,895 meters -- 19,340 ft., Africa's highest 
            peak). Or, a short plane flight can take you to Zanzibar of Spice 
            Islands fame, with it's Arabic influence, Stone Town's labyrinth of 
            narrow, winding streets, mosques, palaces and fortress, and magnificent 
            Indian Ocean beaches. </p>
          <p class="headsub"><a name="course"></a>Course Description</p>
          <p class="Head2">The course starts at the clock tower in central Arusha, 
            which is the exact midpoint of the continent of Africa from north 
            to south. Elevation at start and finish is 1,370 meters (4,500 feet).</p>
          <p class="Head2">The course winds through the city for the first 10 
            km. and then goes out into the countryside on a out and back route, 
            where all the runners can see the lead runners returning into Arusha 
            city. The entire course is rolling hills, with the longest grade being 
            about 2 km. in length. None of the hills are steep. Elevation gain 
            throughout the marathon is about 200 meters. </p>
          <p class="Head2">Through the city streets the roads are closed to vehicle 
            traffic for the sub-3 hour pace runners. Traffic is not controlled 
            for most of the race for all runners, but most road shoulders are 
            wide, paved, and safe. Road surfaces are 95% paved, good quality by 
            Africa standards. As the traffic increases during the day so does 
            the air pollution in the city.</p>
          <p class="Head2">For scenic interest, the course passes colorful markets 
            with tribal people coming to market from distant villages, dressed 
            in their traditional clothing. </p>
          <p class="Head2">Passing from the city to the countryside, the course 
            passes coffee plantations, rows of beautiful, flowering flame trees, 
            then the municipal airport and wheat fields. At the marathon turn 
            around (about 28 kms.) the views of the distant dry plains are fantastic, 
            with volcanic peaks large and small dotting the landscape as far as 
            the eye can see. </p>
          <p class="Head2">The marathon finishes directly up the main street into 
            central Arusha. Traffic is light and only a few shops are open since 
            it is Sunday. This will be the most difficult part of the course as 
            spectators have thinned considerably and most of the final 8 km. is 
            uphill coming back into the city. After passing the clock tower at 
            40+ km., the last 1.5 km. loops back toward the stadium finish and 
            is downhill. </p>
          <p class="Head2">Some of the slower runners have been encouraged in 
            this final section by groups of young children who will run along 
            with the runner for several kilometers, singing songs in unison to 
            offer encouragement and enthusiastic support or just having fun. </p>
          <p class="headsub"><a name="support"></a>Crowd/Runner Support</p>
          <p class="Head2">The send-off at marathon's start is one of the most 
            entertaining and fun-filled experiences in the marathon world. Sometimes 
            a brass band, Tanzania style, keeps the warm-ups going with rousing 
            tunes. Girls' and boys' 5 km. races precede the marathon, with the 
            children totally excited, exercising together in tune with the band. 
            They all take off at the gun like it's a 100-meter sprint. Someone 
            of importance will flag off the marathon, one year it was Tanzania's 
            President. </p>
          <p class="Head2">The marathon crowd, even though numbering only 150 
            runners, builds excitement more than races 10-20 times in size, because 
            this is a very big opportunity for the runners. A high finish might 
            earn a placement on the national team, or an invitation to a European 
            or U.S. road race. </p>
          <p class="Head2">All major intersections have crowds eager to cheer 
            on the runners. After the local runners pass, the biggest cheers are 
            for the foreigners. The spectators find great amusement that runners 
            would come out just to run and not try for first place. </p>
          <p class="Head2">Groups of runners from the U.S. and Japan (World Runners) 
            who participate in the race every year offer runner support to all 
            3+ hours finishers from start to finish. Drinks, snacks, medical aid, 
            and runner pick up and transport to the finish are offered by a number 
            of roving vehicles. </p>
          <p class="Head2">The finish in Sheikh Amri Abeid Stadium is spectacular 
            for faster runners, the place jammed with spectators to watch the 
            sub-3 hour runners finish. The awards ceremony takes place at 11:30 
            a.m. in the stadium. The crowd thins after the 4-hour mark, but the 
            enthusiasm lingers. </p>
          <p class="headsub"><a name="logistics"></a>Race Logistics</p>
          <p class="Head2">Several downtown Arusha hotels are within a few minutes 
            walking distance of the race start. Transportation can be easily arranged 
            by taxi from any other hotel. The same is true after the race, with 
            a taxi stand just outside the stadium.</p>
          <p class="Head2">The race is exceptionally well organized by Africa 
            standards. The course was newly certified by AIMS in July, 2000. 2001 
            will see the 16th running of the marathon. Sub-3 hour marathoners, 
            namely all the local runners, comprise about 90 % of the participants. 
            There are always 15-30 foreign runners out for the running experience 
            as opposed to placing. </p>
          <p class="Head2">Runners can use the roving runners' support vehicles 
            (see runner support) for storage of sweats, cameras, special drinks 
            and snacks, etc. </p>

          <p class="Head2">Race packet pick up is at Sheikh Amri Abeid Stadium 
            in Arusha city center the day before the marathon, or at the marathon 
            press conference. </p>
          <p class="Head2">This pre-race press conference is held at one of the 
            major hotels in Arusha the day before the marathon. All foreign runners 
            are invited to attend. Introductions are made of all the local elite 
            runners. This is a spirited event with much good natured verbal jousting 
            as to who will crush the opposition with their blistering kick, and 
            so on.</p>
          <p class="Head2">There is an unofficial celebratory dinner hosted by 
            the Global Partners and World Runners teams at one of the hotels the 
            evening of marathon day. </p>
