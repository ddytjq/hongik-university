<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">OBSERVATIONS IN PLANETARY EPHEMERIDES</h1>
<h3 ALIGN="CENTER">James L. Hilton</h3>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
Since not everyone who will read these proceedings is an astronomer, I want to give a layman's guide to observations in ephemerides.
<P>
Before I talk about observations in ephemerides, I will answer two questions. What is an ephemeris? What role do observations play in making an ephemeris? I will then discuss properties common to all observations, and the two major types of observations found in planetary ephemerides. I will finish with a quick look at how observations may develop over the next twenty to thirty years.

<H2>What is an Ephemeris?</H2>

<P>
An ephemeris is just a table telling you where something is at a given time. If you have ever used a train timetable like Figure 1, you have used an ephemeris.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="timetable.jpg" BORDER="1" WIDTH="469" HEIGHT="203" TARGET="_top"></IMG></p>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><font size=-1>Figure 1: A train timetable is an example of an ephemeris.</font>

<P>
A planetary ephemeris is the same sort of thing. The only differences between a planetary ephemeris and a timetable are that the planetary ephemeris is three-dimensional rather than one-dimensional and it usually includes the planets' velocities as well as their positions.
<P>
Newcomb is a project to produce high precision ephemerides of solar system objects including the planets, the Moon, asteroids, and possibly the natural satellites of planets. These ephemerides will be used to provide some of the basic research needed to maintain and improve the products of the Nautical Almanac Office and the Astronomical Applications Department.
<P>
To produce a planetary ephemeris you need two equally important ingredients: a mathematical model and observations of the planets.
<P>
A mathematical model is a set of equations that allow me to make predictions from bits of information. For example, let us say that I have a car that travels 60 miles per hour in a straight line and I want to know how far I will travel from 7:00 to 10:00 in the morning. My mathematical model would be:

<center>
<P>
distance	= speed &#215; (ending time - beginning time)
<P>
= 60 miles per hour &#215; (10:00 - 7:00)
<P>
= 60 miles per hour &#215; (3 hours )
<P>
= 180 miles
</center>

<P>
For an ephemeris project, such as Newcomb, the model consists of elements such as the masses of the planets and larger asteroids, their initial positions and velocities, and numerous other parameters that describe the physics of the motions of the planets and link the positions that we observe with the positions as calculated in the ephemeris.

<H2>Observations</H2>

<P>
Observations provide the information needed to design a correct model.
<P>
In the example above, how do I know my speed? How do I know what time I started and stopped? Probably I looked at the speedometer in my car and glanced at my watch when I started and stopped. These are examples of observations.
<P>
Observations are not perfect. They generally contain two types of errors: random errors and systematic errors.
<P>
A random error occurs because the measuring device is not perfect.  Going back to driving my car, after driving for three hours I look at my odometer and rather than saying that I have gone 180 miles it says I have gone 179.5 miles. If I start out again at 60 miles per hour, three hours later my odometer might read 180.1 miles. What is going on here? There is some random factor that is causing small errors in my measurement. Each time I make the measurement I might come out with a slightly different distance. The source of the error may be something simple, like I do not have a second hand on my watch so I can only tell time to the nearest minute. At 60 miles per hour, I move a mile in a minute. Not having a second hand means I can have errors of several tenths of a mile. However, the error is just as likely to be too large as it is to be too small. Thus, if I repeat the measurement several times, the average value measured will be very close to the actual value.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="uncertainty.jpg" BORDER="1" WIDTH="470" HEIGHT="419" TARGET="_top"></IMG>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><font size=-1>Figure 2: The uncertainty in the distance from Washington, DC to Baltimore, MD.</font>

<P>
Systematic errors, however, are harder to handle. This type of error is caused by having an error in the <I>way</I> the observation is made. For example, if the odometer in my car measures kilometers and I think that it measures miles, I would make a systematic error. If I was traveling at 60 miles per hour the odometer would read 96 rather than 60 after one hour. No matter how many times I make this measurement, I will get a similar number every time. The only way to correct this mistake is to calibrate my method of making observations. That is I test my measuring device to determine what unit I am using to make observations. In this example, I can use my watch and speedometer to determine that when my odometer reads 96 I have actually gone 60 miles.
<P>
In making an observation you also have to be careful to define exactly what it is you are measuring. For example, how far is it from Washington, DC to Baltimore, MD? If I measure from city center to city center as shown in Figure 2, the distance is 36 miles. But if I measure from the closest point on each border, the distance is only 27 miles and if I measure from the farthest corner of each city the distance is 48 miles.
<P>
Usually, I want the distance from city center to city center. Where is that? What is the center of a city? Let us define city hall as the city center. City hall, however, does not have to be at the physical center of the city. Now I have to find city hall. If I have a map that shows where city hall is I could use that. Figure 2, however, does not show where the city halls are. The cities are extended objects, that is they are not just points but cover an area on the map. Accurately finding where the city hall is within the city is difficult because what I am looking for is hidden within the blank area of the city.
<P>
For a planetary ephemeris the center I want to observe is the center of mass of the planet, but like the city halls above, it is buried within the body of the planet. Also, like city hall it does not have to be at the physical center of the planet. Usually, it is very close to the physical center, but in the case of Mars it is offset by about 900 yards. This may sound like a small difference, but if it was ignored, the accuracy of the ephemeris of Mars would be 100 time less than the best current Martian ephemeris.
<P>
All planetary ephemeris observations break down into two types: plane-of-sky (angle) observations and time delay-Doppler (distance-speed) observations.

<H2>Plane-of-Sky Observations</H2>

<P>
A plane-of-sky observation is the same as finding where something is on a map of the sky. For example, Figure 3 shows a map of the western sky for 7:00pm March 5, 1999. On the map are the planets Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn in the constellation of Pisces. Like a map, each point on the sky has a pair of coordinates, an address, so we can refer to the planet's position rather than having to draw the map to show where it is.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="littlewest.jpg" BORDER="1" WIDTH="470" HEIGHT="439" TARGET="_top"></IMG>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><font size=-1>Figure 3: An example of a sky map.</font>

<P>
Plane-of-sky observations are the oldest existing observations of the sky. They can be made with the naked eye. We have records of this type of observation among the writings of the Sumerians and ancient Chinese. Using the best techniques presently available our best plane-of-sky observations are 100 times better than those made 200 years ago, and 20,000 times better than those made by our ancient ancestors. The astrometric satellite FAME promises to increase the best accuracy available by another factor of ten.<SUP>1</SUP> On a large scale, the sky does not appear as a plane, but as a sphere that we are at the center of, so our plane-of-sky map is more like the interior surface of a globe than a flat surface. Like a globe, the most convenient units to use for mapping points are angular units. When we refer to the accuracy of a position we use angular units like degree, arcminute, and arcsecond.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Hipparcos.jpg" BORDER="1" WIDTH="470" HEIGHT="374" TARGET="_top"></IMG>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><font size=-1>Figure 4: The mean uncertainty in position as a function of brightness for solar system bodies observed by Hipparcos.</font>

<P>
How good are plane-of-sky observations? Figure 4 shows the observations made by Hipparcos, a spacecraft designed to make high accuracy optical measurements of the stars. Hipparcos observed some of the asteroids and satellites of the planets along with the stars.<SUP>2</SUP> The accuracy depends on how bright the object is. The best single observation positions have an accuracy of 2/1000 of an arcsecond.
<P>
However, observing the position of a planet is more difficult than it is for a point object like a star or asteroid for several reasons. Planets, like a city, are extended objects. They have visible disks when you look at them through a telescope rather than appearing as points of light, like a star. Except for Mercury and the Moon, they all have atmospheres which means that their edges are fuzzy. The Moon is so close that its edge does not appear smooth but lumpy because of mountain ranges and crater rims near the edge of the disk. Jupiter and Saturn rotate so fast that they appear to be elliptical rather than circular. Saturn's rings may be beautiful to look at, but they make it difficult to observe its position. Mercury, Venus, the Moon, and, to a lesser extent, the other planets go through phases because we see only part of the lit surface (Figure 5). All of these effects lead to both random and systematic errors in observing the position of a planet. The absolute best optical plane-of-sky observations of the planets have uncertainties of about a tenth of an arcsecond.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><font size=-1>Figure 5: Venus, like Mercury, the Moon, and Mars has phases that make it difficult to determine its position.</font>

<P>
An arcsecond is equal to 1/3600 of a degree. This is a very small angle. For example, the circle that makes up the Naval Observatory is 1000 feet in radius (Figure 6). If you were to walk all the way around the perimeter, you would walk about 6283 feet, over one nautical mile. Viewed from the center of the observatory, an arcsecond along the circle that forms this perimeter is only 1/16 of an inch!

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><font size=-1>Figure 6: The U.S. Naval Observatory is on a circular plot of land 1000 feet in radius.</font>

<P>
Now you are probably wondering, "Does anything ever have to be that accurate?" The answer is, "This is not nearly accurate enough."
<P>
Like a map, plane-of-sky observations are two-dimensional. They do not include the distance from the observer to the object. Just like a landscape is projected onto a flat canvas, planets and stars are projected onto the plane-of-sky.
<P>
The distance to an object is important in converting from the angular unit of measure of a plane-of-sky observation to the linear unit of measure of an ephemeris. The farther away an object is the larger the uncertainty in the linear position for a given uncertainty in its angular position. That is, an object that is farther away from us needs to move a greater linear distance to have the same angular change in position. Figure 7 shows the linear uncertainty in position, in miles, for an observation of each of the planets at its closest approach to the Earth for an observed angular uncertainty of one arcsecond. The Moon is so close to the Earth that the linear uncertainty is only one mile while the linear uncertainty in the position of Neptune is never less than 19,000 miles. Thus when talking about something at the distance of Neptune, an arcsecond is the equivalent of ten times the distance from Washington, to Los Angeles.

<P>
Take the recent Mars Pathfinder mission. It had to hit a spot on the surface of Mars 450 yards across. If you were a marksman on the Earth, to hit this target you have to be accurate to 1/10,000 of an arcsecond. Fortunately, Mars Pathfinder could make in-flight corrections. The size of these corrections had to be small because the amount of fuel available was limited. Including in-flight corrections, Mars Pathfinder only had to be accurate to 1/100 of an arcsecond.<SUP>3</SUP>
<P>
Hitting this target would be ten times more difficult than anything Natty Bumpo<SUP>4</SUP> ever did. However, it is child's play once you consider the additional complications that were needed to get Mars Pathfinder to its target on Mars.
<P>
First, both the Earth and Mars wobble on their axes.
<P>
Second, the orbits of the Earth and Mars around the Sun are not circular, but elliptical and the speed at which each planet moves changes depending on its distance from the Sun.
<P>
Third, not only does the Earth's gravity hold us down on its surface, but it reaches out across the solar system and tugs on Mars, so Mars does not follow the orbit that it would if it were circling the Sun by itself. In addition to the Earth and Mars, every body in the solar system has a gravitational effect on every other body. To determine the motion of Mars well enough for Mars Pathfinder to hit its target, not only was the gravitational pull of all the planets included, but the gravitational pull of the Moon, and 300 of the largest asteroids were included as well.<SUP>5</SUP>
<P>
With all the uncertainty in the observations how is it possible to produce a high accuracy ephemeris? There are at least four things that can be done.
<P>
First, many observations taken over a long period of time will reduce the uncertainty in the ephemeris. This is the traditional way of achieving higher accuracy. Recently, I produced a set of ephemerides for fifteen of the largest asteroids.<SUP>6</SUP> On average, each asteroid had 4000 observations covering 150 years. The average uncertainty in the observations was 3 arcseconds. The uncertainty in the position of the asteroids in the final ephemerides ranged from 1/15 to 1/60 of the uncertainty in the average observation.
<P>Second, observe the satellites of the planets rather than the planets themselves. The advantage in observing the satellites of the planets is that they appear as points on the sky. Thus we get rid of all of the complications that make the accuracy of the positions of the planets a factor of about 300 worse than the accuracy of the best positions of the stars. Hipparcos, which has produced the most accurate optical plane-of-sky observations to date,<SUP>2</SUP> observed the brightest satellites of Jupiter and Saturn. The astrometric satellite FAME is designed to produce individual observations ten times more accurate than Hipparcos and will be able to observe the brightest satellites of Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.<SUP>1,7</SUP> However, to find the ephemeris of a planet from observations of its satellites you need to determine the ephemerides of the satellites as well. Thus, the model for producing the planet ephemeris must be more complex. Also, not all planets have satellites.
<P>
Third, use Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to make observations. This works by taking observations at two or more radio telescopes separated by long distances, sometimes by as much as the diameter of the Earth. These observations are combined to produce very high accuracy position observations of an object. These observations are about 100 times more accurate than the most accurate optical plane-of-sky observations. However, to make these observations you need a small, powerful radio source on or near the planet. The only sources that fit this requirement are spacecraft. Therefore, you need spacecraft like Galileo or Magellan circling a planet. Just like observing the satellites of a planet, you now need to include the orbit of the spacecraft around the planet. VLBI is also expensive. Because of these restrictions, only a couple dozen VLBI observations of the planets exist even though they are very accurate.
<P>
Fourth, you can make time delay-Doppler (distance-speed) observations rather than plane-of-sky observations.

<H2>Time delay-Doppler Observations</H2>

<P>
Time delay or distance observations are made by sending out a pulse of light or radio waves from a source, such as a radar or laser. This pulse is reflected off a body and received back at its source. Since the speed of light is constant, the length of time it takes to make the round trip tells you how far away the body is. Figure 8 gives an example of distance observations using a radio telescope.
<P>
Also, if the body is moving towards us, it will "crowd together" the light or radio waves by reflecting each wave crest a little sooner than expected. Conversely, if the body is moving away from us the time between each wave crest being reflected off the planet is a little later than expected. This allows us to find the speed at which the body is moving either towards or away from us by comparing the wavelength that was sent out with the one that is returned to the observer. This is called the Doppler<SUP>8</SUP> effect, and is how radar guns detect the speed of an automobile or baseball.
<P>
The great advantage of time delay-Doppler observations is that they are very accurate, especially if you know exactly where the pulse is being reflected from on the surface of the body. The distance from the Earth to the Moon can be measured with an uncertainty of less than an inch because we can use lasers to bounce light pulses off reflectors left on the Moon by the astronauts. This is called Lunar Laser Ranging. We were able to do nearly as well with Mars using radio waves and the transponders on the Mars Viking landers and the Mars Pathfinder spacecraft to act like reflectors. These gave the distance to Mars to an uncertainty of only 11 yards over more than 48,000,000 miles! Even without a known reflector the distances to the surfaces of Mercury and Venus is measured with an uncertainty of less than 1 mile.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="radar.jpg" BORDER="1" WIDTH="470" HEIGHT="213" TARGET="_top"></IMG>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><font size=-1>Figure 8: Bouncing a radar pulse of a planet is an example of a time delay observation.</font>

<P>
Time delay-Doppler observations have two drawbacks. First, you need a surface that will reflect the pulse. This means that while lots of observations have been made of Mercury, Venus, Mars, and the Moon we can not get pulses returned from the giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn because they absorb the radio waves rather than reflecting them. These, of course, are the planets from which we most want time delay-Doppler observations because they are so distant that their plane-of-sky observations have the largest linear uncertainties.
<P>
The second drawback is that it takes a lot of energy in the pulse sent out to receive an observable return signal. The farther away an object is or the smaller an object is the fainter its return signal. If two objects are the same distance away, but one is only &frac12; the size of the other, the strength of the reflected signal from the larger object will be four times greater than from the smaller object. If two objects are the same size but one is twice as far away the signal strength from the nearer object will be 16 times greater. To date, the most distant objects to have time delay observations made are two observations each of Ganymede and Callisto, two of the large satellites of Jupiter.<SUP>9</SUP>

<H2>Future Observations</H2>

<P>
Although optical plane-of-sky observations will probably never be as accurate as time delay-Doppler observations, they will continue to play a dominant role in the ephemeris observations of the outer planets for as long as other observation types remain relatively rare. Better ephemerides of the satellites of the outer planets and better methods of observation will probably increase the use of optical observations of the planets' satellites as a method of improving the ephemerides of the planets.
<P>
VLBI and time delay-Doppler observations of spacecraft on or near other planets will most likely continue to be the most accurate observations that can be made. However, these observations will remain rare because the cost of launching and observing these interplanetary spacecraft is high. The next new source of spacecraft observations will be from the Cassini spacecraft that is currently on its way to Saturn.
<P>
Time delay observations of objects farther out in the solar system may be made in the near future. Radar observations have been made of Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn,<SUP>10</SUP> but the return signal was too weak to be used in determining the distance using the time delay. However, a recent upgrade to the Arecibo radio telescope,<SUP>11</SUP> may make radar ranging to Titan feasible.
<P>
The orbit of the Moon is known to within a fraction of a yard, thanks to Lunar Laser Ranging. Until we have better models dealing with the effects of the interior structure of the Earth and Moon and the effect of the asteroids on the Moon's orbit, it is unlikely that we will be able to improve significantly on the ephemeris of the Moon. However, the inadequacies in the model for the orbit of the Moon also mean that Lunar Laser Ranging needs to continue to maintain the present accuracy of the ephemeris.
<P>
Knowing the position of the Moon to a fraction of a yard may sound excessively precise. However, as man moves away from the Earth, high accuracy ephemerides are a necessity to finding his way around the solar system and will be necessary when man returns to the Moon.
