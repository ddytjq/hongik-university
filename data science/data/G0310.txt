<H1>
Vacuum Energy Density, or How Can Nothing Weigh Something?
</H1>

<P>
Recently two different groups have measured the apparent brightness of
<A HREF="./sne_cosmology.html">supernovae</A>
with redshifts near z = 1.  Based on this data
the old idea of a <EM>cosmological constant</EM> is making a comeback.
</P>

<H2>Einstein Static Cosmology</H2>

<P>
Einstein's original cosmological model was a static, homogeneous model
with spherical geometry.  The gravitational effect of matter caused an
acceleration in this model which Einstein did not want, since at the time
the Universe was not known to be expanding.  Thus Einstein introduced a
<EM>cosmological constant</EM> into his equations for General Relativity.
This term acts to counteract the gravitational pull of matter, and so
it has been described as an <EM>anti-gravity</EM> effect.
</P>
<P>
Why does the cosmological constant behave this way?
</P>
<P>
This term acts like a 
<A HREF="./glossary.html#VED">vacuum energy density</A>, an idea which has
become quite fashionable in high energy particle physics models since
a vacuum energy density of a specific kind is used in the Higgs mechanism for
spontaneous symmetry breaking.  Indeed, the 
<A HREF="./cosmo_04.htm">inflationary scenario</A> for the first
picosecond after the Big Bang proposes that a fairly large vacuum energy
density existed during the inflationary epoch.
The vacuum energy density must be associated with a negative pressure
because:
<UL>
<LI>The vacuum energy density must be constant because there is nothing for it
to depend on.
<LI>If a piston capping a cylinder of vacuum is pulled out, producing more
vacuum, the vacuum within the cylinder then has more energy which must have
been supplied by a force pulling on the piston.
<LI>If the vacuum is trying to pull the piston back into the cylinder, 
it must have a negative pressure, since a positive pressure would tend to
push the piston out.
</UL>
The magnitude of the negative pressure needed for energy conservation is
easily found to be <EM>P = -u = -rho*c<SUP>2</SUP></EM>
where <EM>P</EM> is the pressure, <EM>u</EM> is the vacuum energy density,
and <EM>rho</EM> is the equivalent mass density using 
<EM>E = m*c<SUP>2</SUP></EM>.
</P>

<P>
But in General Relativity, <EM>pressure has weight</EM>, which means that
the gravitational acceleration at the edge of a uniform density sphere
is not given by
<PRE>
g = GM/R<SUP>2</SUP> = (4*pi/3)*G*rho*R
</PRE>
but is rather given by
<PRE>
g = (4*pi/3)*G*(rho+3P/c<SUP>2</SUP>)*R
</PRE>
Now Einstein wanted a static model, which means that <EM>g = 0</EM>, but
he also wanted to have some matter, so <EM>rho &gt; 0</EM>, and thus
he needed <EM>P &lt; 0</EM>.  In fact, by setting
<PRE>
rho(vacuum) = 0.5*rho(matter)
</PRE>
he had a total density of <EM>1.5*rho(matter)</EM> and a total pressure
of <EM>-0.5*rho(matter)*c<SUP>2</SUP></EM> 
since the pressure from ordinary matter is 
essentially zero (compared to <EM>rho*c<SUP>2</SUP></EM>).
Thus <EM>rho+3P/c<SUP>2</SUP> = 0</EM> and the gravitational acceleration
was zero, 
<PRE>
g = (4*pi/3)*G*(rho(matter)-2*rho(vacuum))*R = 0
</PRE>
allowing a static Universe.
</P>

<H2>Einstein's Greatest Blunder</H2>

<P>
However, there is a basic flaw in this Einstein static model: it is unstable
- like a pencil balanced on its point.  For imagine that the Universe
grew slightly: say by 1 part per million in size.  Then the vacuum energy
density stays the same, but the matter energy density goes down by 3 parts per
million.  This gives a net negative gravitational acceleration, which makes the
Universe grow even more!  If instead the Universe shrank slightly, one gets a
net positive gravitational acceleration, which makes it shrink more!  Any small
deviation gets magnified, and the model is fundamentally flawed.
</P>

<P>
In addition to this flaw of instability, the static model's premise of a static
Universe was shown by Hubble to be incorrect.
This led Einstein to refer to the cosmological constant as his greatest
blunder, and to drop it from his equations.
But it still exists as a possibility -- a coefficient that should be determined
from observations or fundamental theory.
</P>

<H2>The Quantum Expectation</H2>

<P>
The equations of quantum field theory describing interacting particles
and anti-particles of mass <EM>M</EM> are very hard to solve exactly.
With a large amount of mathematical work it is possible to prove that the
ground state of this system has an energy that is less than infinity.
But there is no obvious reason why the energy of this ground state should be
zero.  One expects roughly one particle in every volume equal to the
Compton wavelength of the particle cubed, which gives a vacuum density of
<PRE>
rho(vacuum) = M<SUP>4</SUP>c<SUP>3</SUP>/h<SUP>3</SUP> = 10<SUP>13</SUP> [M/proton mass]<SUP>4</SUP> gm/cc
</PRE>
For the highest reasonable elementary particle mass, the Planck mass of
20 micrograms, this density is more than 10<SUP>91</SUP> gm/cc.
So there must be a suppression mechanism at work now that reduces the vacuum
energy density by at least 120 orders of magnitude.

<H2>A 
<A HREF="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/statistics/">
Bayesian</A> Argument</H2>

<P>
We don't know what this mechanism is, but it seems reasonable that 
suppression by 122 orders of magnitude, which would make the effect of the
vacuum energy density on the Universe negligible, is just as probable as
suppression by 120 orders of magnitude.  And 124, 126, 128 etc.
orders of magnitude should all be just as probable as well, and all give
a negligible effect on the Universe.  On the other hand suppressions by
118, 116, 114, etc. orders of magnitude are ruled out by the data.
Unless there are data to rule out suppression factors of 122, 124, etc.
orders of magnitude then the most probable value of the vacuum energy density
is zero.
</P>

<H2>The Dicke Coincidence Argument</H2>

<P>
If the supernova data and the CMB data are correct, then the vacuum density 
is about 75% of the total density now.  But at redshift z=2, 
which occurred 11 Gyr ago for this model if H<SUB>o</SUB> = 65,
the vacuum energy density was only 10% of the total density.  And 11 Gyr in the
future the vacuum density will be 96% of the total density.  Why
are we alive coincidentally at the time when the vacuum density is in the
middle of its fairly rapid transition from a negligible fraction to the
dominant fraction of the total density?  If, on the other hand, the
vacuum energy density is zero, then it is always 0% of the total density and
the current epoch is not special.
</P>

<H2>What about Inflation?</H2>

<P>
During the inflationary epoch, the vacuum energy density was large:
around 10<SUP>71</SUP> gm/cc.  So in the inflationary scenario the
vacuum energy density was once large, and then was suppressed by a large
factor.  So non-zero vacuum energy densities are certainly possible.
</P>

<H2>Observational Limits</H2>

<H3>Solar System</H3>

<P>
One way to look for a vacuum energy density is to study the orbits of
particles moving in the gravitational field of known masses.
Since we are looking for a constant density,
its effect will be greater in a large volume system.
The Solar System is the largest system where we really know what the masses
are, and we can check for the presence of a vacuum energy density by a careful
test of Kepler's Third Law: that the period squared is proportional to the
distance from the Sun cubed.  The centripetal acceleration of a particle moving
around a circle of radius R with period P is
<PRE>
a = R*(2*pi/P)<SUP>2</SUP>
</PRE>
which has to be equal to the gravitational acceleration worked out above:
<PRE>
a = R*(2*pi/P)<SUP>2</SUP> = g = GM(Sun)/R<SUP>2</SUP> - (8*pi/3)*G*rho(vacuum))*R
</PRE>
If <EM>rho(vacuum) = 0</EM> then we get
<PRE>
(4*pi<SUP>2</SUP>/GM)*R<SUP>3</SUP> = P<SUP>2</SUP>
</PRE>
which is Kepler's Third Law.  But if the vacuum density is not zero, then
one gets a fractional change in period of
<PRE>
dP/P = (4*pi/3)*R<SUP>3</SUP>*rho(vacuum)/M(sun) = rho(vacuum)/rho(bar)
</PRE>
where the average density inside radius R is 
<EM>rho(bar) = M/((4*pi/3)*R<SUP>3</SUP>)</EM>.
This can only be checked for planets where we have an independent measurement
of the distance from the Sun.  The Voyager spacecraft allowed very precise
distances to Uranus and Neptune to be determined, and Anderson <EM>et al.</EM>
(1995, ApJ, 448, 885) found that <EM>dP/P = (1+/-1) parts per million</EM>
at Neptune's distance from the Sun.  This gives us a Solar System limit
of
<PRE>
rho(vacuum) = (5+/-5)*10<SUP>-18</SUP> &lt; 2*10<SUP>-17</SUP> gm/cc
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
The cosmological constant will also cause a precession of the perihelion
of a planet.
<A HREF="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJ/v493n1/36511/36511.html">
Cardona and Tejeiro (1998, ApJ, 493, 52)</A> claimed that this
effect could set limits on the vacuum density only ten or so times
higher than the critical density, but their calculation appears to
be off by a
<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9805292">
factor of 3 trillion.</A>  The correct advance of the perihelion
is <EM>3*rho(vacuum)/rho(bar)</EM> cycles per orbit.  Because the
ranging data to the Viking landers on Mars is so precise, a very good
limit on the vacuum density is obtained:
<PRE>
rho(vacuum) &lt; 2*10<SUP>-19</SUP> gm/cc
</PRE>
</P>

<H3>Milky Way Galaxy</H3>

<P>
In larger systems we cannot make part per million verifications of the standard
model.  In the case of the Sun's orbit around the Milky Way, we only say that
the vacuum energy density is less than half of the average matter density
in a sphere centered at the Galactic Center that extends out to the Sun's
distance from the center.  If the vacuum energy density were more than this,
there would be no centripetal acceleration of the Sun toward the Galactic
Center.  But we compute the average matter density assuming that the vacuum
energy density is zero, so to be conservative I will drop the "half" and
just say
<PRE>
rho(vacuum) &lt; (3/(4*pi*G))(v/R)<SUP>2</SUP> = 3*10<SUP>-24</SUP> gm/cc
</PRE>
for a circular velocity <EM>v = 220 km/sec</EM> and a distance
<EM>R = 8.5 kpc</EM>.
</P>

<H3>Large Scale Geometry of the Universe</H3>

<P>
The best limit on the vacuum energy density comes from the largest possible
system: the Universe as a whole.  The vacuum energy density leads to an
accelerating expansion of the Universe.  If the vacuum energy density
is greater than the critical density, then the Universe will not have gone
through a very hot dense phase when the scale factor was zero (the Big Bang).
We know the Universe went through a hot dense phase because of the light
element abundances and the properties of the cosmic microwave background.
These require that the Universe was at least a billion times smaller in the
past than it is now, and this limits the vacuum energy density to
<PRE>
rho(vacuum) &lt; rho(critical) = 8*10<SUP>-30</SUP> gm/cc
</PRE>
The recent <A HREF="./sne_cosmology.html">supernova results</A> suggest that
the vacuum energy density is close to this limit:
<EM>rho(vacuum) = 0.75*rho(critical) = 6*10<SUP>-30</SUP> gm/cc</EM>.
The ratio of <EM>rho(vacuum)</EM> to <EM>rho(critical)</EM> is called
<EM>lambda</EM>.  This expresses the vacuum energy density on the same
scale used by the density parameter <EM>Omega</EM>.  
Thus the supernova data suggest that <EM>lambda = 0.75</EM>. 
If we use
<EM>Omega<SUB>M</SUB></EM> to denote the ratio of ordinary matter density to
critical density, then the Universe is open
if <EM>Omega<SUB>M</SUB> + lambda</EM> is less than one,
closed if it is greater than one, and flat if it is exactly one.
If <EM>lambda</EM> is greater than zero, then the Universe will 
expand forever unless the matter density <EM>Omega<SUB>M</SUB></EM> is much
larger than current observations suggest.  For <EM>lambda</EM> greater than
zero, even a closed Universe can expand forever.</P>

The figure above shows the regions in the
<EM>(Omega<SUB>M</SUB>, lambda)</EM> plane that are suggested by the
current data.
The green region in the upper left is ruled out because there would not
be a Big Bang in this region leaving the CMB spectrum unexplained.
The red and green ellipses with yellow overlap region show the LBL
team's allowed parameters (red) and the Hi-Z SN Team's allowed
parameters (green).  The blue wedge shows the parameter space region
that gives the observed Doppler peak position in the angular power
spectrum of the CMB.  The purple region is consistent with the CMB
Doppler peak position and the supernova data.  The big pink ellipse
shows the possible systematic errors in the supernova data.

The figure above shows the scale factor as a function of time for
several different models.  The colors of the curves are keyed to the
colors of the circular dots in the 
<EM>(Omega<SUB>M</SUB>, lambda)</EM> plane Figure.
The purple curve is for the favored
<EM>Omega<SUB>M</SUB> = 0.25</EM>,
<EM>lambda = 0.75</EM> model.
The blue curve is the Steady State model, which has 
<EM>lambda = 1</EM> but no Big Bang.
</P>

<P>
Because the time to reach a given redshift is larger in the
<EM>Omega<SUB>M</SUB> = 0.25</EM>,
<EM>lambda = 0.75</EM> model than in the <EM>Omega<SUB>M</SUB> = 1</EM>
model, the angular size distance and luminosity distance are larger in
the lambda model, as shown in the space-time diagram below:</P><P>

The <EM>Omega<SUB>M</SUB> = 1</EM> model is on the left, the
<EM>Omega<SUB>M</SUB> = 0.25</EM>,
<EM>lambda = 0.75</EM> model is on the right.
The green line across each space-time diagram shows the time when the
redshift was <EM>z = 1</EM>, which corresponds to approximately to the
most distant of the supernovae observed to date.
Using a ruler you can see that the angular size distance to <EM>z =
1</EM> is 1.36 times larger in the right hand diagram, which makes the
observed supernovae 1.84 times fainter (0.66 magnitudes fainter).
</P>

<H2>Conclusion</H2>

<P>
In the past, we have had only upper limits on the vacuum density and
philosophical arguments based on the Dicke coincidence problem and
Bayesian statistics that suggested that the most likely value
of the vacuum density was zero.  Now we have the supernova data that
suggests that the vacuum energy density is greater than zero.  This result is
very important if true.  We need to confirm it using other techniques,
such as the 
<A HREF="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov">MAP</A> satellite which will observe
the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background with angular
resolution and sensitivity that are sufficient to measure the vacuum energy
density.
