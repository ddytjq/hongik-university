<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Phase Transitions in the Early Universe<BR>
</H1>

<H2>Towards the very early universe...</H2>

<P>As we move backwards in time towards the moment of creation, prior to
one hundredth of a second, the universe becomes hotter and denser until
matter actually changes its phase, that, is it changes its form and properties.
An everyday analogue familiar to all is simply water.<BR>
<BR>
With increasing temperature we see a succession of <B>phase transitions
</B>for water in which its properties change dramatically: the solid phase
- ice - melts to the liquid phase - water - and then eventually boils to
the gaseous phase - steam. You should notice that steam is `more symmetric'
than water, which is in turn more symmetric than ice&nbsp;(<B><I>Can you
see why? You can find an explanation <A HREF="#water">below</A>...</I></B>)
And so it is with matter in our Universe; it begins in a unified or `symmetric'
phase (as we will explain below) and then passes through a succession of
phase transitions until, at lower temperatures, we finally obtain the matter
particles with which physicists are familiar today, that is, electrons,
protons, neutrons, photons etc. </P>

<P>As we shall see in the next few pages, phase transitions may have had
profound implications on the evolution of our Universe and its contents.
Moreover, it is some direct `remnants' of these transitions are still around
today! The two key concepts of unification and phase transitions are vital
to our present understanding of particle physics. </P>

<H2>Unification</H2>

<P>The basic premise of <I>grand unification</I> is that the known symmetries
of the elementary particles resulted from a larger (and so far un known)
symmetry group G. Whenever a phase transition occurs, part of this symmetry
is lost, so the symmetry group changes. This can be represented mathematically
as</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>G -&gt; H -&gt; ... -&gt; SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) -&gt; SU(3)
x U(1).</H4>

<P>Here, each arrow represents a symmetry breaking phase transition where
matter changes form and the groups - G, H, SU(3), etc. - represent the
different types of matter, specifically the symmetries that the matter
exhibits and they are associated with the different fundamental forces
of nature. These fundamental forces are the following:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Electromagnetism</B>: The group U(1) is associated with the electric
and magnetic forces, that is, phenomena such as electricity and light.
It was Maxwell's great achievement at the the end of the nineteenth century
to unify electric and magnetic effects into one single mathematical theory
- electromagnetism. <BR>
</LI>

<LI><B>Weak nuclear force</B>: This is the nuclear force associated with
radioactivity in many unstable nuclei. In particular, it is associated
with the decay of a neutron into a proton. The weak nuclear force was unified
with electromagnetism by Weinberg and Salam in the late seventies, into
what is known as electroweak theory and which is described by the group
SU(2)xU(1). Predictions from this standard unified model were confirmed
at the CERN particle accelerator in Geneva in the early 1980's. <BR>
</LI>

<LI><B>Strong nuclear force: </B>The group SU(3) is associated with the
strong nuclear force which binds together neutrons and protons inside nuclei.
The mathematical theory describing the elementary particles in this theory
- quarks and gluons - is known as quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The model
is well understood in principle but, in practice, quantitative calculations
prove to be very difficult. Models which unify the strong nuclear force
with electroweak theory are known as grand unified theories or GUTs. <BR>
</LI>

<LI><B>Gravity: </B>The weakest force of all - the gravitational force
- is not included in the above scheme. The unification of the other fundamental
forces with gravity is one of the great intellectual challenges facing
theoretical physics. A number of possibilities exist, such as superstring
theory, and they are known as TOEs, that is, theories of everything. </LI>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="water"></A>The analogue of water may again prove useful in
understanding the concept of symmetry and symmetry breaking. The liquid
phase of water is rotationally symmetric, that is, it looks the same around
each point regardless of the direction in which we look. We could represent
this large three-dimensional symmetry by the group G (actually SO(3)).
The solid form of frozen water, however, is not uniform in all directions;
the ice crystal has preferential lattice directions along which the water
molecules align. The group describing these different discrete directions
H, say, will be smaller than G. Through the process of freezing, therefore,
the original symmetry G is broken down to H.</P>

<H2>Phase transitions</H2>

<P>The cosmological significance of symmetry breaking is due to the fact
that symmetries are restored at high temperature (just as it is for liquid
water when ice melts). For extremely high temperatures in the early universe,
we will even achieve a grand unified state G. Viewed from the moment of
creation forward, the universe will pass through a sucession of phase transitions
at which the strong nuclear force will become differentiated and then the
weak nuclear force and electromagnetism. </P>

<P>Phase transitions can have a wide variety of important implications
including the formation of <A HREF="cs_top.html">t<B>opological defects</B></A>
-cosmic strings, domain walls, monopoles and textures - that will be discribed
in more detail in the following pages, or it may even trigger a period
of exponential expansion (<B>inflation</B>). Our discussion of these effects
will focus on the very early universe, that is, in the earliest moments
during the first one hundredth of a second after the Big Bang.</P>

<P>Phase transitions can be either dramatic - first order - or smooth -
second order:</P>

<P><B>First-order</B> phase transitions (illustrated below) occur through
the formation of bubbles of the new phase in the middle of the old phase;
these bubbles then expand and collide until the old phase disappears completely
and the phase transition is complete.</P>

<H5 ALIGN=CENTER><I>First order phase transitions proceed by bubble nucleation.
A buble of the new phase (the true vacuum) forms and then expands until
the old phase (the false vacuum) disappears. A useful analogue is boiling
water in which bubbles of steam form and expand as they rise to the surface</I>.</H5>

<P><B>Second-order </B>phase transitions, on the other hand, proceed smoothly.
The old phase transforms itself into the new phase in a continuous manner.<BR>

<H5 ALIGN=CENTER><I>During a first-order phase transition, the matter fields
get trapped in a `false vacuum' state from which they can only escape by
nucleating bubbles of the new phase, that is, the `true vacuum' state.</I></H5>
