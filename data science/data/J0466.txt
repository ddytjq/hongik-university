for Kalitta in Columbus</strong></font><br>
</p>

<p align="left"><br>
<strong>Columbus, OH, (June 10, 2002)</strong> - After a
heart-breaking first round loss to<br>
Luigi Novelli at the previous NHRA POWERade Drag Racing Series
tour stop<br>
in Joliet, Illinois, Doug Kalitta and the Mac Tools/Kalitta
Motorsports<br>
Top Fuel dragster team are looking forward to redeeming
themselves at<br>
the Pontiac Excitement NHRA Nationals in Columbus, Ohio, June
13-16 at<br>
National Trail Raceway.<br>
<br>
&quot;Our team really needs a great weekend,&quot; said
Kalitta.&nbsp; &quot;Lately, we have<br>
not been performing as well as we know we can.&nbsp; Our Mac
Tools dragster<br>
is running great, but recently we have not had all the pieces
fall into<br>
the right places.&nbsp; Several round wins in Columbus would be
great for the<br>
morale of the whole team and get us back into contention for the<br>
POWERade championship fight.&quot;<br>
<br>
The team knows they need to win rounds soon to improve upon their<br>
current fifth place points standing and to maintain any chance of<br>
winning the 2002 NHRA POWERade Top Fuel Championship.&nbsp; They
also have<br>
another incentive to do well in Columbus.&nbsp; Columbus is home
to the<br>
corporate headquarters of Mac Tools.&nbsp; Team Kalitta wants to
run well for<br>
all of the Mac Tools staff and distributors that show a
tremendous<br>
amount of loyalty to the team throughout the season.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Co-Crew Chief Jim Oberhofer said, &quot;The Mac Tools/Kalitta
Motorsports<br>
dragster team is excited about racing in front of so many Mac
Tools<br>
fans.&nbsp; We know how to win.&nbsp; We want to win again right
now.&nbsp; Our team is<br>
not accustomed to struggling.&nbsp; We need to get back to our
winning ways<br>
and make everyone more comfortable.&quot;<br>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><b><u>Scotty
Cannon</u></b></font></p>

<p><strong>( Monday, June 10, 2002)</strong> <font
face="Times New Roman">The haircut is called a 'Mohawk' and
Scotty Cannon has worn the signature style for years. He will
tell you that it is pretty high maintenance, but he keeps it up
because, well, because he can. Cannon has yet to collect a
national event victory in NHRA Funny Car racing, but he has a fan
following that rivals 11-time Funny Car champion John Force. He
is always straightforward, but he may seem a little distracted
this season. Before the 2002 season started, Cannon joined Don
Schumacher Racing, joining Whit Bazemore in a two-car team. He is
more committed and focused than ever. The driver of the Oakley
Pontiac Firebird wants to win and he is not giving up until he
makes winning a habit.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Q: What has been the
biggest challenge for you since you began your NHRA career in
1999?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">CANNON: The biggest
challenge has been setting up the team. You have to have the
right crew chief and the right chemistry to be competitive. This
is a little more up-scale and political than other racing series
that I have been with. It hasn't been as much of a challenge as
it has been an adjustment. I haven't had too many problems and
have any big dilemmas. I have done a pretty good job keeping my
sponsor all four years. I was the crew chief on the car for a
while and have always been a team owner and driver. That is
different this year and I think it is going to work out. I think
it is going to be better this year. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Q: What are you going to
do when you get that first victory?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">CANNON: You mean if I
get that first win? Nah, I'm just kidding. I don't know what I
will do when it happens. I will probably keep going, drive the
car back down the return road. Not turn it off. I don't know.
I've won a lot of races and hopefully that can keep me in a state
of mind of when I used to win. I'm not going to let one win take
me to the highest high because you have to come back down and you
might see the lowest lows. I like to be a middle of the road guy.
I will enjoy the win, by far, a whole bunch. I just hope I keep
my composure. It's been a long time since I won a race.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Q: What has kept you out
of winner's circle so far?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">CANNON: Last year was a
total flop. I really don't know what happened with (the crew
chief). We got along good, we all gelled as a team. We just had a
bad, bad year. It was terrible. This year has been good. The
second year I was racing we went to eight semis and one final.
That was pretty frustrating to make it to the semis and then get
knocked out. It is just a very hard road. You come in on the
bottom and you race against these guys who have been doing this
forever and they are just more experienced. The veterans know how
to race these cars. Qualifying isn't supposed to be as hard.
Racing on Sunday is a another world. It's a whole different
ballgame. It's not even the same. The first round of qualifying
is you just trying to get in. Then you have to go back to qualify
again and you are racing the guy who qualified best. Do you go
for it and take a chance on smoking the tires? Or do you take it
easy and try to get in a good, solid run so you make a good read
of the track? There is a lot to it and you have to have people
with a lot of experience to race the top car and to be successful
on Sunday. When I raced Pro Mods, I wasn't always the best
qualifier, I was a lot, but not always. Racing on Sunday and
making everyone make their mistakes first was the key. I tried to
let the other guy make the mistake or make him outrun you. You
get outrun sometimes, but that is better than losing from a
mistake you made.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Q: What is one thing
that is different about the Funny Car category than some of the
other classes?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">CANNON: In the nitro
class, you need a little bit more luck than some of the other
classes. I'm not saying it is more difficult than the other
classes, but you need some breaks to win. You need breaks for it
to be your day. You can make your breaks, and John Force has
proved that. Anybody that has won a championship knows that you
make your luck. You know what he can do and when you pull up
beside him, you know you have got to run fast. He keeps you on
the raggedy edge. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Q: As long as you have
been racing Funny Cars, John Force has been the guy to beat - the
champion. What do you think about Force?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">CANNON: I think John has
done a lot for the sport. He handles the pressure well. He has
always been nice and polite to me. One thing I do know about John
is that if you are doing poorly and not winning, he has a
tendency to mingle with you. He'll talk to you as a racer and be
more friendly. That's not a bad thing, I would probably be just
like him. If you are a threat, he has a tendency not to give any
attention to you or speak to you. He'll avoid you. He never shows
any fear, but he will isolate himself from his competitors. I
don't have anything super good to say about him except for that
he has done a lot for the sport. He has never done anything for
me, and he has never done anything against me. He's just a good
old guy, I guess.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Q: What is it going to
take to knock John Force off the top of the Funny Car standings?</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">CANNON: I think what we
are doing now is what we should be doing. We are putting together
a two-car program and we need to have the program together and
working well for a long time. We need it for a period of five or
six years, not just one or two, to build a competitive program.
We need to keep our sponsors happy and make sure they stick
around, not leave after a short time. We need to keep our team
together for some time. We have proved that we have fast enough
race cars. We just need some financing and a little more
refining. That's all. We just need time because I think we have
the right program. The key is someone like Don Schumacher
stepping up to the plate and putting the whole program together.
To me, that was the key to this whole deal. Outside of having our
big sponsors, the key has been Don having the guts to invest this
kind of money and good sponsors. He has got a lot of good people
in this program.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Q: What has been the
best thing about joining the two-car team?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">CANNON: The best part
about this as far as I can tell right now is Saturday nights. You
can sit down and look at the data and you have eight runs to look
at instead of just four runs. An example is Pomona at the
beginning of the year. I was first out in front of Whit. I went
out and smoked the tires. They made an adjustment to Whit's car
and he went right down the track. In Phoenix, it happened again.
Whit was first out, he smoked the tires and they adjusted my car.
I went out and made a clean pass. That is the advantage of the
two-car team. Even though one of the cars is going to go out
first and that other car is going to have an advantage is the
first qualifying session, you still have the data off both cars.
It is still an advantage over a single-car team. If a single car
team goes out and smokes the tires, he just has that one pass to
look at. I won't say that he won't have any data, but he won't
have valuable data. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Q: Did you ever think
you would ever be a part of a two-car team?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">CANNON: I didn't plan it
this way. I wasn't aiming for this. But after three years of
learning the business and the ropes, I've learned that the
direction that this sport has taken us in has led us to create
two and three-car teams. If you want to run for a championship,
it is a no-brainer. You are going to have to do it with a two or
three-car team. That is just my opinion. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Q: Do you miss being the
team owner and the driver at the same time?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">CANNON: Would I rather
own my own team? Probably not. I like this deal pretty good. Do I
like making the money that I am making with this deal? I would
rather own my own team. You make a lot less money driving. That
is going to be something I will need to adjust to, if I can
adjust. I'm not sure how that is going to work out for next year.
I don't know. This is the trial year of this situation and I will
sit down and think about my situation and then I will make my
decision.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Q: What made you decide
to go with the 'Mohawk' haircut?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">CANNON: Me and some
friends, we all have kids, and I would take my boys and we would
all go to the beach. In the middle of the summer I would have the
Mohawk and when I came back to race, I'd still have it for a few
races before it grew out. It's a little aggravating to keep up
with, to be honest. It just so happened that when I came over
with Oakley, and let's just say that they are not a normal
company. They are a good company, but they are not a normal,
normal company. Very good, but not normal. The Mohawk kind of fit
in and they knew I wore it. Then I started wearing it more and
they liked it. I wear it all the time now and I like it. It is my
trademark in a way but I really like wearing it. A lot of
sponsors would be offended by it in a way. Maybe not this day and
time, but it would have even five or six years ago. There have
really been some fashion changes in the last few years. What is
cool in 2002 was not in 1997. This would not have worked.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Q: What do you think
about your large fan base?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">CANNON: Well, I would
like to give credit to when I won those six championships. I
don't think that I would have the fan base if I just came over
(to the NHRA) got into a car and just because I had the Mohawk, I
don't think they would have followed me. I think a lot of the
championships that I have won and the way I treat my fans are the
reasons why we have such a big fan base. I spend a lot of time
with the fans and I really enjoy what I am doing. I think people
can see that. If I am down or not feeling good, people are going
to know that too. I just try to be myself all the time. It's not
hard. I am just lucky to be able to do what I want to do and be
who I am. I am pretty sure that Oakley would not be interested in
me if everyone talked bad about me the way they talk good as far
as fans are concerned. I am pretty sure I would not be here.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Q: Do you find it
difficult to be in the spotlight as a driver and maintain your
true personality everyday?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">CANNON: On the whole,
no, especially not to the point to where it is annoying. The
problem sometimes is trying to separate things such as the
business part of it and the enjoyment and the fan part of it. I
don't think that the fans should ever have to suffer in any way,
shape or form just because of any difficulty that I am going
through with the business part of it or driving part of racing.
The fans should not be a part of that. They shouldn't have to
share anything that is bad. They do, with all drivers, but I try
not to. I just try to go with the flow. I am pretty sure if I
start doing anything wrong, somebody will tell me. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Q: What is your dream
race? Who are you racing, where and how do you win?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">CANNON: I really don't
care who is in the other lane. I really don't have a dream race.
My dream is to win a championship and to do that, you have to win
a few races. Any race will do. Atlanta would probably be my pick
because it is near my hometown and residence. You would have to
have the National Guard to get everyone and make them leave the
track if I won a race there. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Q: When it was announced
that you were joining Schumacher Racing, people started to wonder
how the two Funny Car drivers would get along. What has it been
like to be teammates with Whit Bazemore?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">CANNON: The problem is
that people don't see us working together. It has been a really
good thing.&nbsp; We both want to race, we both have our own race
car and I would like to think that we are both good drag racers.
We both want to win as bad as the other one and I can see that.
Those are all good things. It's not like I am going over there
and saying, 'Whit, get your head out of your ass and win!' I
don't have to tell him that and he doesn't have to tell me that.
That is good too. At the same time, he has a different charisma
than I do. That is a good thing too because we are not in
competition there. He has his own way and I have my own way. We
actually respect each other in a lot of ways. Really, it is an
ideal situation. There are a lot of things we respect about each
other, but we are very different. We don't act the same. We don't
pack our parachutes the same way. I am more of a hands-on guy and
he is not. We do talk a lot of strategy with each other. I see
people race him and if I see something another guy is doing, and
if I think it would help him, I will tell him. He does the same
for me. That is what it takes to make the team run well together</font></p>
