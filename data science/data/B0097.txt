<h1>Voicing Your Concerns</h1>
<h4><b>The steps to take if you need to resolve a problem or complaint with Birmingham 
  Midshires.</b></h4>

<H2>We Can Help</H2>

<p><b>We aim to provide you with the highest standards of service. However, there 
  may be occasions when you feel you have cause for complaint. If so, our staff 
  will try to resolve the problem. If you're not satisfied, you can take your 
  complaint further through our established customer complaints procedure.</b></p>

<h2>Step 1</h2>
<p><b>For branch complaints, please contact your local branch. For other complaints, 
  please contact our Corporate Centre.</b></p>

<p>We would like you to talk to us about your complaint to give us the opportunity to put it right. There are lots of ways you can do this.</p>
<p>Call in to or phone your local branch and discuss the problem with our staff 
  or ring our Corporate Centre on 01902 302000 with details of your complaint. 
  This will ensure we pass your call to the correct team, who will deal with the 
  problem. We'll always take the time to listen and do whatever we can to help.</p>
<p>The information needed to resolve most problems is available to our staff who 
  have day-to-day responsibility for looking after your account. They'll be in 
  the best position to deal with your query as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>If you are still not satisfied they will immediately refer your complaint to their Manager.</p>
<p>Where possible he or she will always ring you, but sometimes it may be better 
  for us to write to you to explain. Whatever happens, we'll write to you within 
  five working days.</p>



<h2>Step 2</h2>

<p><b>Referral to Customer Relations who will contact you.</b></p>

<p>In the unlikely event that your concerns cannot be resolved at this level please write to:</p>
<p><b>Customer Relations Team <br>
  Birmingham Midshires <br>
  PO BOX 81<br>
  Pendeford Business Park <br>
  Wobaston Road <br>

  </b>or telephone:<b> 01902 325695</b></p>

<p>If you make a written complaint, we'll send a letter of acknowledgement within 
  two working days of receipt. We'll also tell you when we'll be able to give 
  you a more detailed response.</p>
<p>If you remain dissatisfied, please refer to Step 3 of the complaints process.</p>

<h2>Step 3</h2>

<p><b>Referral to an Ombudsman</b></p>

<p>We are committed to resolving complaints whenever possible through our complaints 
  procedure. However, if a matter can't be resolved, we'll issue a letter of deadlock, 
  enabling you to refer your complaint to the Ombudsman.</p>

  about outstanding disputes. You can find details about the Ombudsman at the 
  <a href="#ombud">bottom of this page</a>.</p>

<h2>Birmingham Midshires Financial Services Limited</h2>

<p><b>Compliance Team<br>
  Birmingham Midshires<br>
  PO BOX 81<br>

<p>If your complaint relates to advice given after 1 January, 1992, this acknowledgement 
  may come from AXA Sun Life if your complaint complaint relates to an AXA Sun 
  Life policy. However, the acknowledgement may come from Halifax if your complaint 
  relates to a product sold to you by Birmingham Midshires Independent Financial 
  Services Limited.</p>
<p>If your matter can't be resolved satisfactorily, then you have the right to 
  refer your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.</p>
<h2>Advice</h2>
<p>Birmingham Midshires Financial Services Limited is an appointed representative 
  of the AXA Sun Life Marketing Group. Because of this, complaints relating to 
  the sale of AXA Sun Life products through Birmingham Midshires financial consultants 
  since January 1992, may need to be passed to our colleagues at AXA Sun Life 
  to investigate. Please note this does not include advice given by a Birmingham 
  Midshires Independent Financial Services Limited adviser.</p>
