Custom controls are tools that provide the programmer with particular functions and visual objects. When added to a form and selected the Properties window display the associated property list and these can be altered either at design-time (to create defaults) or a run-time.

<H3>The Basic Custom Controls</H3>
<IMG SRC="images/ctrl-txt.gif" alt="Text Control Icon" align=middle>   the Text Box Control allows text to be entered by the user.
<p>
<IMG SRC="images/ctrl-but.gif" alt="Button Control Icon" align=middle>   the Command Button Control help controls user interactions

<IMG SRC="images/ctrl-lbl.gif" alt="Label Control Icon" align=middle>   the Label Control displays non-editable text<P>
<IMG SRC="images/ctrl-lst.gif" alt="List Box Control Icon" align=middle>   the List Box Control allows the programmer to display lists of items.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/ctrl-chk.gif" alt="Check Box Control Icon" align=middle>   the Check Box Control provides the user with a True/False or Yes/No (boolean) option.

<IMG SRC="images/ctrl-map.gif" alt="Map Control Icon" align=middle>   the Geosoft's Map Control, provides properties &amp; events for displaying spatial &amp; attribute data.
<H3>Name Convention</H3>

Controls are reference within the program code by their name. Visual Basic allocates a default name whenever a control is created, but usually this has no real meaning <I>e.g.</I>command1. It is good practice to change the name of the control straight after is has been created.
<P>
Control properties are reference through the control names. For example to add a text to a Text Control

Hint: If the name of a control is changed after code has been added then the code is no longer attached to the control. Therefore decide on a naming convention beforehand and stick to it.

<I>Miscellaneous Information</I>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Custom controls are composed of a single VBX file (<I>e.g. mapedit.vbx</I>) usually located in the c:\windows\system directory. Complex controls are usually associated with one or more dynamic link libraries (*.dll files). 
<LI>Custom controls are added to VB by using the <I>File|Add file</I> option from the main program menu. These additional files are added to the MAK file and displayed in the Project window.
