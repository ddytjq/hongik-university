    24, 1998, a Delta rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral. It was
    a routine launch bearing an ordinary-looking spacecraft. But
    NASA insiders knew better. This mission was something special
    -- even its name was out of the ordinary: Deep Space 1 (DS1).</P>

    <P>Most space probes are put together using tried-and-true technology,
    minimizing the chances of failure. But DS1 left Earth bristling
    with the <I>un</I>-tried. Its mission was to test a dozen new
    exotic technologies. Among them: a long-lasting ion propulsion
    engine, a solar array that focused sunlight for extra power,
    and software that endowed the craft with artificial intelligence
    to conduct its own affairs.</P>

    Duane Clausen, and JPL.</FONT></P>

    <P>Ground controllers must have nail-biting nightmares about
    such missions. Almost anything on Deep Space 1 might go wrong.
    And when it did the spacecraft itself would be in charge!</P>

    <P>But as they say, fortune favors the bold. Deep Space 1 spent
    nearly a year trying out its uncertain technologies and, improbably,
    they all worked -- many beyond expectations. DS1's ion engine,
    for instance, is now the longest-operating propulsion system
    in the history of the space program.</P>

    </TABLE>&quot;Deep Space 1 tested these advanced technologies
    so that other missions wouldn't have to bear the costs of being
    first,&quot; explains Marc Rayman, the Deep Space 1 Project Manager
    at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. &quot;And it was a big success.&quot;</P>

    <P>Rayman leads a resourceful band of JPL scientists and engineers
    who share their spacecraft's trailblazing spirit. Always thinking
    of new things to try, they were plotting Deep Space 1's next
    adventure even before its primary mission of technology testing
    was done. &quot;We wanted to fly by a comet,&quot; recalls Rayman.
    It's something few spacecraft had tried before. Indeed, comets
    are virgin territory compared to better-studied planets and asteroids.
    Flying into the unknown seemed a natural mission for Deep Space
    1.</P>

    <P>Rayman continued: &quot;When we were firing the ion engine
    during tests in 1998 and 1999 we always steered to keep our options
    open for an encounter.&quot; Their favorite target was <A HREF="http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/db?201525">19P/Borrelly</A>,
    an intriguing comet that had veered toward the Sun during the
    19th century when it passed too close to Jupiter. It's been swinging
    through the inner solar system every 6.9 years since. Borrelly
    would reach perihelion (its closest approach to the Sun at 1.36
    AU) on Sept. 14, 2001 -- just right for a meeting with Deep Space
    1.</P>

    <P>But first NASA had to approve the scheme. There were good
    reasons to go, says Rayman, but approval was not a foregone conclusion.
    &quot;NASA has many important objectives and, of course, limited
    funding. Still, we were hopeful because our primary mission had
    been so successful.&quot;</P>

    ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="1" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="see caption"></A>Only
    one spacecraft has ever captured close-up pictures of a comet
    before: the European Space Agency's Giotto probe, which flew
    a scant 596 km from the core of Comet Halley in 1986. Photographs
    revealed Halley's nucleus as one of the blackest objects in the
    solar system -- one of Giotto's most surprising finds! Unfortunately,
    flying comet dust destroyed Giotto's camera, so when the probe
    flew even closer to comet Grigg-Skjellerup in 1992, the craft
    was blind.</P>

    [<A HREF="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/giotto.html">more</A>]</FONT></P>

    <P>At least four more spacecraft -- CONTOUR, Stardust, Deep Impact,
    and the ESA's Rosetta -- will rendezvous with comets in the years
    ahead. But scientists aren't sure if Giotto's experience will
    be a reliable guide for those missions.</P>

    <P>&quot;Comets are as individual as people,&quot; explains Rayman.
    &quot;You couldn't expect to learn about the whole human race
    by studying a single person. Likewise, Halley can't reveal all
    we need to know about comets.&quot;</P>

    <P>By visiting Borrelly, Deep Space 1 could examine a second
    comet at close range, perhaps as near as 2000 km, and provide
    valuable intelligence to comet mission planners.</P>

    <P>In late 1999 NASA headquarters agreed: Deep Space 1 could
    visit Borrelly. &quot;We were overjoyed,&quot; says Rayman, ever
    game for a new adventure. There was little time to spare for
    celebration, though. When Rayman heard the good news Borrelly
    was already plunging toward perihelion. &quot;We needed to leave
    soon,&quot; he recalls.</P>

    <P>And, of course, that's when disaster struck.</P>

    <P>Just as Deep Space 1 was setting sail for the comet in late
    1999, its guidance system, called the &quot;Star Tracker,&quot;
    suddenly failed. The Star Tracker was a computerized camera (ironically
    not one of the probe's experimental devices) that measured DS1's
    orientation with respect to the stars. Without it, the spacecraft
    was lost.</P>

    <P><A HREF="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast06jun%5F1.htm"><IMG

    ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="1" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="see caption"></A>JPL
    engineers quickly came up with a solution. They would reconfigure
    &quot;<A HREF="http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/ds1/tech/micas.html">MICAS</A>&quot;
    (an experimental camera that DS1 had just finished testing) to
    serve as a makeshift Star Tracker. It was a brilliant plan, but
    there was one drawback: Deep Space 1 was 300 million km away.
    No one could lay their hands on the spacecraft! Their only option
    was to transmit radio commands across interplanetary space, telling
    the onboard computer how it could transform MICAS into a star
    tracking navigator.</P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Right</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1"
     FACE="Arial">: JPL engineers use <A HREF="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast06jun%5F1.htm">Deep
    Space Network</A> antennas like this one to transmit commands
    and receive signals from Deep Space 1. </FONT></P>

    <P>It was a spine-tingling operation: Time was short and testing
    was hurried -- one false command to the navigation system might
    disorient the craft forever! But in the end, Deep Space 1 was
    saved. &quot;It was a thrilling rescue,&quot; recalls Rayman,
    &quot;and just in time to catch Borrelly.&quot; (You can read
    a more complete account <A HREF="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2000/ast11jul_1.htm">here</A>.)</P>

    <P>On June 28, 2000, with MICAS at the helm, Deep Space 1 aimed
    for the comet and revved its ion engine -- the beginning of a
    15-month journey. Twice since then solar storms have scrambled
    the makeshift navigation system, and once MICAS tried to fix
    on a star that was too dim. &quot;In each case, the DS1 team
    managed to coax the spacecraft back to normal,&quot; says Rayman.
    &quot;It was stressful work. And unforgettable. There's nothing
    quite like joining a half-dozen space experts (powered by Oreo
    cookies) in the middle of the night to joystick a spacecraft
    that's hundreds of millions of kilometers away.&quot;</P>

    <P>One more such incident, notes Rayman, and the encounter with
    Borrelly will likely fail. Fortunately the long journey is almost
    over. On September 22nd, Deep Space 1 will finally reach the
    comet -- and begin its greatest adventure yet.</P>

    <P>This month amateur astronomers can easily spot Comet Borrelly
    through a 10 inch or larger telescope. Glowing at 9th magnitude
    in the constellation Gemini, it looks like a fuzzy blob with
    a short, faint tail.</P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Below</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1"
     FACE="Arial">: Using a 30 cm telescope, astronomer <A HREF="http://cometwatch.com/">Tim
    Puckett</A> captured this image of Comet Borrelly on Sept 15,
    2001. A longer-exposure <A HREF="../images/ds1/puckett2.gif">negative
    image</A> reveals Borrelly's faint tail.</FONT></P>

    <P><A HREF="../images/ds1/puckett1.gif"><IMG SRC="../images/ds1/puckett1_med.gif"
    ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="1" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="249"
    ALT="see caption"></A>That blob is the comet's coma, a huge cloud
    of gas spanning 50,000 km which hides Borrelly's nucleus deep
    within. The nucleus is an asteroid-sized mixture of ice, dust
    and rock. Albeit small, it's the source of all we see. Ices in
    Borrelly's nucleus, warmed by sunlight, are vaporizing furiously
    -- spitting dust and blowing gaseous jets. It's a maelstrom that
    could be deadly to a ship like Deep Space 1.</P>

    <P>&quot;Unlike Giotto,&quot; says Rayman, &quot;DS1 was not
    built to encounter a comet. It has no shielding to protect it
    from flying debris. A single particle of comet dust the width
    of a human hair can deliver as much energy as a bowling ball
    does when it crashes into the pins.&quot; Deep Space 1 could
    be rocked hard by such particles dozens of times as it transits
    the coma -- about an hour-long journey at 16.5 km/s (37,000 mph).</P>

    <P>That's not much time to find Borrelly's nucleus. &quot;Our
    goal is to capture a black and white photo of the sunlit side
    of the nucleus while the spacecraft is about 8000 km away,&quot;
    says Rayman. But, he adds, it won't be easy. As soon as Deep
    Space 1 plunges into the haze, the navigation camera will have
    to stop tracking stars and begin searching for the core. Onboard
    gyros will do their best to hold the spacecraft steady as MICAS
    snaps a rapid-fire sequence of photos and analyzes them for hints
    of the comet's core. The procedure is complicated by the fact
    that no one knows if the nucleus will be dark (like Halley's)
    or bright; or if the irregular 5 by 5 by 8 km core will appear
    end-on or edge-on. And, of course, the spacecraft itself might
    be listing, buffeted by comet dust.</P>

    <P>If MICAS beats the odds and finds the nucleus, scientists
    will get more than just a black and white photo. In addition
    to its optical camera, MICAS is also equipped with an experimental
    infrared spectrometer that can sense minerals from afar. (Even
    the impressive Giotto probe didn't carry such a device.) Not
    only will scientists see what Borrelly's nucleus looks like,
    they'll also learn what it's made of!</P>

    <P>While MICAS conducts its feverish search for the nucleus,
    other instruments on board DS1 will be calmly collecting valuable
    measurements of the surrounding coma. &quot;We've reconfigured
    many of DS1's sensors to study Borrelly,&quot; Rayman says. For
    instance, ion engine diagnostic sensors will &quot;listen&quot;
    for plasma waves in the gaseous coma and attempt to detect the
    comet's magnetic field. Also, an experimental mass spectrometer
    named &quot;<A HREF="http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/ds1/tech/spectrometer.html">PEPE</A>&quot;
    will identify atoms and molecules in gases blowing by the spacecraft.
    &quot;This is a wonderful opportunity to learn what the coma
    is made of,&quot; says Rayman.</P>

    <P>Whether DS1 will emerge from the coma with stunning new data
    -- or emerge intact at all -- remains to be seen. But no matter,
    the Borrelly encounter is a guaranteed success by virtue of its
    daring. If the spacecraft is destroyed, other missions will be
    more wary and perhaps survive thanks to DS1's sacrifice. If the
    spacecraft lives, it will beam back priceless scientific information.</P>

    <P>&quot;This journey has been filled with adventure -- much
    of it different from what we had planned,&quot; says Rayman.
    &quot;But that's OK. You're not going to win the big prizes if
    you don't take the big risks.&quot;</P>
