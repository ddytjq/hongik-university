India scored 221-6 from 46.4 overs to win by four wickets</b><br>Teams:<br>India: Kumble (capt), Tendulkar, Laxman, Mongia, Sehwag, Badani, Bangar, Ratra, H Singh, Agarkar, Srinath<br>England: Hussain (capt), Trescothick, Knight, Vaughan, Collingwood, Hollioake, Flintoff, Snape, Foster, Gough, Hoggard<br><br>India made one forced change, with captain Sourav Ganguly missing out due to a hamstring injury. All-rounder Sanjay Bangar was recalled to the side. England were unchanged, with Andrew Caddick and Graham Thorpe unable to find a way back into the side.<br><br>England surprisingly opted against recalling Graham Thorpe for a second straight match, instead choosing the stick with the same side that performed so admirably in winning in Cuttack.<br><br>India were forced to go into the game without their captain, with Sourav Ganguly suffering a hamstring injury and Anil Kumble becoming the 17th person to captain the country in one-day internationals.<br><br>All-rounder Sanjay Bangar replaced Ganguly for the game in front of a sell-out crowd in Chennai.<br><br>England won the toss, ending Nasser Hussain&#8217;s barren run in one-day games. The tourists elected to bat on a decent pitch that was expected to be good for the batsmen.<br><br><b>England innings</b><br>The first over was a forgettable one for Javagal Srinath, it included a first-ball wide and a no-ball. His next over wasn&#8217;t much better, with 11 runs being plundered off it as the tourists made a quick start to the game.<br><br>Marcus Trescothick was looking in fine form once again with some destructive strokeplay as England move to 36-0 after six overs.<br><br>Nick Knight was proving a useful partner with some good running between the wickets.<br><br>It wasn&#8217;t to last long however as India made the breakthrough in the seventh over. Srinath, who had just been hit for another boundary by Trescothick, claimed the wicket of Knight for 10. The left-hander made a hash of an attempted pull and was easily caught by Dinesh Mongia to leave England on 42-1.<br><br>Trescothick continued to look to pile on the runs, hitting Srinath to the covers for four. But the next over he was out, with Agit Agarkar again claiming his wicket.<br><br>The England opener got an edge to a rising delivery from the Indian paceman and Ajay Ratra made no mistake. Trescothick was out for 36, with his runs coming from just 34 balls.<br><br>Michael Vaughan had a few early scares as he looked to continue to keep the scoreboard ticking over.<br><br>Disaster struck for the tourists lost their skipper after just four balls. Hussain mistimed a struck off the bowling of Bangar and the ball fell invitingly into the hands of Harbhajan Singh.<br><br>It will have been desperately disappointing exit for Hussain, so keen was he to enjoy his return to the city of his birth. The England captain scored just one run and England were left on 61-3.<br><br>India cut off the boundaries but both Michael Vaughan and Paul Collingwood kept the run-rate up with some good running between the wickets and by finding the gaps in the field.<br><br>Collingwood received a let-off when he tried to hit came down the wicket to hit Bangar, he managed only an edge and was lucky to see the ball miss his wickets and go for four runs.<br><br>He didn&#8217;t last long as he misjudged a top spinner from Harbhajan Singh and caught an edge which came off Ratra and was snapped up by VVS Laxman. The youngster adding 13 from 15 balls and his exit saw England fall to 90-4.<br><br>England were really in need of a big partnership to stem the flow of wickets. Vaughan was joined by Andrew Flintoff but his troubles with the bat on tour continued as he got out to an awful shot.<br><br>The big all-rounder had scored just eight runs when he played a ball from Kumble straight back into the bowlers arms.<br><br>England were seeing all their early work undone with not only the wickets tumbling, but the run-rate fell well below five-an-over. After 25 overs they were 117-5.<br><br>In the 29th over Kumble took the vital wicket of Vaughan, when he was caught by Tendulkar for 43 to leave the tourists on an alarming 125-6.<br><br>Ben Hollioake was joined by Jeremy Snape in the center, with much needed from the two inexperienced players if England were to set any sort of target for the home side.<br><br>After a couple of big shouts by the home side, Hollioake hit Kumble over the boundary for six to provide a brief moment of joy for the tourists.<br><br>The pair brought up the 50-partnership in the 39th over and while the run-rate continued to look poor they had achieved their ambition of restricting the loss of wickets.<br><br>Agarkar was brought back into the attack and he picked up his second wicket thanks to a poor shot by Snape. The England all-rounder went for 38 as he tried to work a straight ball through the mid-wicket area but misjudged the delivery and saw the ball dislodge his stumps.<br><br>The wicket ended a 70-run stand and left England on 195-7, with less than seven overs remaining.<br><br>Agarkar struck again to remove Hollioake for 38, as he saw his attempted shot go straight in the air and into the hands of Kumble.<br><br>Darren Gough&#8217;s innings lasts seven balls and six runs. The England bowler was clean bowled by Agarkar trying to hit the medium pacer out of the ground.<br><br>Matthew Hoggard added just one more run before he was run out to leave England all out for 217 in the final ball of the 48th over.<br><br>India were set a victory target of 218.<br><br><br><b>India innings</b><br>India set off at a roaring rate, with Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag both looking to make short work of the England total.<br><br>A combination of some slack bowling and some great strokemaking saw the hosts move to 40-0 from the first five overs. Gough went for 0-31 from his first three overs, with one over costing him 17 runs.<br><br>At 47-0 Snape had a chance to remove Sehwag, but he couldn&#8217;t hold onto a ball that came flying at him at some pace at the gully position.<br><br>Tendulkar continued to pick off the bad ball, and even some good deliveries, as he brought up his half-century in the 14th over. His 50 came from just 44 balls and included nine boundaries.<br><br>Sehwag continued to offer fine support to the Little Master, moving to 30 as the hosts coasted to 83-0 from 15 overs.<br><br>He passed the 50-mark in the 18th over by hitting Snape to the boundary. His half-century came from just 56 balls and included eight boundaries.<br><br>The next ball he was out as he tried to hit Snape over the top and instead found the hands of Trescothick for 51, to leave India still in the driving seat on 107-1.<br><br>Laxman came in at number three for the first time in the series.<br><br>At the halfway stage of their scheduled overs India were 128-1, well on course to pass the England total and with only a shocking collapse likely to prevent them from taking a 2-1 lead in the series.<br><br>Snape was managing to contain Tendulkar better than most and he got his reward in the 27th over when he took India&#8217;s prize wicket.<br><br>Tendulkar had scored 68 from 79 balls when he misjudged a straight ball from the England off-spinner and was given out lbw.<br><br>Despite the loss of such an influential player, India were just 87 runs behind with eight wickets and nearly 24 overs in hand.<br><br>Matthew Hoggard finally got the rewards for his efforts when he bowled Laxman for 26 in the 36th over. The Indian batsmen was undone by a slower ball from the England paceman.<br><br>The wicket left the hosts on 165-3, needing 53 still to win.<br><br>If England were hopeful that wicket would be a turning point, Mongia was quick to dispel that notion by lofting Hoggard over the boundary rope for a huge six.<br><br>There was further hope offered to the tourists in what was turning out to be a key over from Hoggard, with Dinesh edging a wide ball to James Foster for 21.<br><br>That left India on 172-4 and with some work still to be done.<br><br>The Indian middle-order collapse continued with Sanjay Bangar lasting just four balls and adding just one run before he became the third wicket for Hoggard.<br><br>The England bowler got some extra pace and Bangar edged the ball to Trescothick at first slip to leave India on 174-5.<br><br>Foster put down a chance, but Hemang Badani and Ajay Ratra were able to steady the ship, with the wicket-keeper hitting two glorious boundaries as part of a stand of 27.<br><br>Badani was next to go with the score on 201, with Gough claiming his first wicket with the help of the safe hands of Foster.<br><br>With plenty of overs to knock off the remaining runs, Ratra and Agit Agarkar played it safe and they reached their target with 20 balls to spare, finishing on 221-6 after 46.4 overs.<br><br><b>India won by four wickets and lead the series by 2-1.</b></font></p>
