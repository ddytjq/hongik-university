<b>
       The New Creationism: Biology Under Attack <br>

       By Barbara Ehrenreich and Janet McIntosh <br>
</b>

       When social psychologist Phoebe Ellsworth took the podium at a recent
       interdisciplinary seminar on emotions, she was already feeling rattled.
       Colleagues who'd presented earlier had warned her that the crowd was
       tough and had little patience for the reduction of human experience to
       numbers or bold generalizations about emotions across cultures. Ellsworth
       had a plan: She would pre-empt criticism by playing the critic, offering a
       social history of psychological approaches to the topic. But no sooner had
       the word "experiment" passed her lips than the hands shot up. Audience
       members pointed out that the experimental method is the brainchild of
       white Victorian males. Ellsworth agreed that white Victorian males had
       done their share of damage in the world but noted that, nonetheless, their
       efforts had led to the discovery of DNA. This short-lived dialogue
       between paradigms ground to a halt with the retort: "You believe in DNA?"

[1998 May 9] Permission was received in a letter dated April 30, 1998.

2a. illustration to remain until June 30, 1999
2b. I have to report the number of user-accesses
3. live pointer to www.usnews.com

| Dear Ms. LeClair:
| 
| Thank you for giving me permission to use your gif at my web site
| http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/LeftHanded.DNA.html.  I will be sending you
| the agreement this coming week.
| 
| However, I wanted to clarify one item.  You asked that "Our illustration
| shall remain on your web site until June 30, 1999."  Did you mean that it
| should remain there up to that time and be removed after that time or that it
| should remain at least up to that time?  In other words, what happens after
| that date - am I allowed to keep it or do you want me to remove it?  My
| preference is to keep it as long as I am maintaining the web site.
| 
| The initial visit count is 993.
| 
| Sincerely,

| 
| Given the context of the page this is extremely unlikely.  Please look at the
| information at the top of the page:
| 
| http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/LeftHanded.DNA.html
| 
| If you read that material you will see that there is no possibility of

| 
| As you will see from looking at my page, the graphic is incorrect.  Perhaps
| you would consider having a few words with that artist about this.
| Correction would be simple:  reverse the right side DNA one so that it is
| right handed.
| 
| Please reconsider my request after looking at my page.  I have removed the

| Dear Tom,
|     I FINALLY got around to looking at your fascinating website.  It seems
| that we are in good company (or at least a lot of company) in getting our
| DNA wrong.  Our artist didn't know beans ab out DNA and has been gone for
| two years.  I never liked her rendition anyway--it looks like handcuffs.  I
| suppose we can either redo it or apologize in a future issue for getting it
| wrong.  I don't know who refused to let you use our masthead, but as the
| chief editor, I can ask the others to reconsider.  It doesn't look either
| left or right-handed to me--it just looks flat, which is also wrong.  I'll
| get back to you in a week or so.  Do you have any ideas about why so many
| people draw  DNA this way? It seems to be wired into our visual perce

It is of some interest that DNA <b>does</b>

The little device at the bottom corresponds
to the "helicase" enzymes that

"Miracle Vaccines".
They report that certain
pathogens
have been discovered to contain both left and right handed
DNA.  To fight these, the right handed DNA can be extracted
and used in a naked DNA vaccine, as shown in this diagram.
People with right handed DNA will then express antigens
against the right handed proteins on the surface and therefore
will be protected from the disease.
This is a very smart use of molecular technology!
It is still mysterious how these pathogens live using both
kinds of DNA.
