              <p><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">In
              recent years there is an increasing interest in how to teach
              playing the Point Guard position.&nbsp; While there have been a
              few products to hit the market it is without a doubt one of the
              thinnest areas of the basketball coaching product market and
              equally one of the most difficult to consolidate into some
              teachable form.&nbsp; This new video released by Ed Schilling Jr.
              (author of <a href="5star_review.asp">Dynamic Ball Handling Skills
              &amp; Drills</a> and <a href="eschilling2_review.asp">Buddy Ball</a>),
              and Will Rey (<a href="5star_review.asp">Offensive Low Post Play</a>)
              is an outstanding effort to concretely advance how the point guard
              position should be taught and played. Let us take a look at why we
              are excited about this brand new release.</span></font></p>
              <p><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">The
              video was created on the premise that the point guard position is
              the key to your team's success.&nbsp; The goal therefore is to
              teach you ways of improving your point guard's play from both a
              coach's and player's perspective.&nbsp; In addition, the producers
              of this video introduce to us a unique new way of presenting
              coaching related material.&nbsp; In each given section one coach
              gives tips and pointers from the offensive point guards
              perspective.&nbsp; Immediately following the other coach becomes
              the devil's advocate and offers useful tips and instruction how
              the point guard wants to defend.&nbsp; Conceptually it is somewhat
              like the old Spy vs. Spy cartoons in Mad Magazine (for those old <img border="0" src="../../../../images/Reviews/close_down_the_gap.gif" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5">enough
              to know what I'm talking about).&nbsp;&nbsp; What is good about
              this approach is that it's amazingly interesting to rotate back
              and forth between the offensive and defensive objectives and in
              it's own way gives you almost a third dimension of
              understanding.&nbsp; In learning theory this is called contextual
              learning where teaching A + B doesn't equal AB, but may lead to C,
              D or P or T.&nbsp; You can almost feel the tug-o-war between the
              offensive and defensive tactics Coach Schilling and Rey
              demonstrate in the video. It does give you a sense of what it is
              really like playing the PG position even though you are just
              watching video of the skills and drills.</span></font></p>

              for Success at the Point</span></font></h3>
              <p><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">The
              video opens with Coach Schilling and Rey discussing factors to
              consider when selecting a person to play the point position.&nbsp;
              These included things like instincts, toughness, the ability to
              deliver the ball, and agility (more important than
              athleticism).&nbsp; They proceed to provide factors which they
              believe contribute most to a point guards success including being
              credible to the coach and teammates, dependable, resourceful and
              stable.&nbsp; This portion of the video takes up less than 10
              minutes but is a powerful skeleton of ideas which you should
              consider when you are choosing who will lead your team.&nbsp; Many
              guard videos focus on skills which this one does as well.&nbsp;
              But we really like their emphasis in this section on the mental
              aspects of being a team leader and why each of those items are
              important to your team's success.</span></font></p>
              <h3><font size="1" color="#FF6600"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Skillfully
              Done</span></font></h3>
              <p><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">The
              meat of Running the Team consist of 14 drills demonstrated on the
              court.&nbsp; Each drill is designed to emphasize and develop a key
              skill aspect of playing the point guard position.&nbsp; The first
              drill is called Up 2-Back 2 and focuses on teaching ball handlers
              how to beat pressure defense.&nbsp; Remember however that this
              video isn't just about playing the point from an offensive point
              of view.&nbsp; When Coach Schilling talks about &quot;creating
              separation between the offensive and defensive player&quot; with
              the dribble, Coach Rey follows with the defensive PG perspective
              about keeping tight spacing, pressure on the ball, nose over the
              ball, and the goal of turning the dribbler to control them.&nbsp;
              This &quot;spy vs. spy&quot; method continues through-out the
              course of all 14 drills.&nbsp; So the benefit of this video is
              both offensive and defensive for your PG's.&nbsp; <img border="0" src="../../../../images/Reviews/create_an_opening.gif" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10"></span></font></p>
              <p><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">The
              second drill is called the &quot;Chill Drill&quot; a famous
              Five-Star Basketball Camp drill created by the famous Howard
              Garfinkel, to teach a variety of ball handling skills and moves in
              a short period of time.&nbsp; This Chill Drill is also
              demonstrated in Ed Schilling's previous Dynamic Ball Handling
              video.</span></font></p>
              <p><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">From
              here on out the drills just start rolling.&nbsp; First, 1 on 1
              Toughness, another drill to each how to handle hard pressure on
              the ball.&nbsp; Coach Rey states &quot;the offensive player must
              be the one in control, don't let the defense take your space
              away&quot;, and Coach Schilling provides &quot;keep hard pressure
              on the basketball taking away vision and direct passes&quot; as a
              key focal point for the defender in the drill.</span></font></p>
              <p><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">In
              1 on 1 Zig Zag, the emphasis for the offensive is to change speeds
              and direction to keep the defender off balance.&nbsp; The defender
              is conversely working to make the guard change directions, and
              &quot;being offensive on defense&quot; to control the dribbler at
              all times.&nbsp; Coach Schilling states &quot;try to get to the
              basket in the fewest number of dribbles possible...the best move
              is no move, just blow by them.&quot;&nbsp; Coach Rey exhorting the
              defense on, replies &quot;employ the sprint-recovery technique

              drills included in the video are 1 on 1 Half to Full Court Drill
              (emphasis: attacking pressure to score, and convert immediately to
              defensive pressure), 2 on 2 Guard-Forward Entry (emphasis:
              teaching a PG how to create separation to get the offense
              started),&nbsp; 2 on 2 Draw &amp; Kick (emphasis: teaching
              technique to beat your defender to draw another and open up a
              teammate).&nbsp; In 2 on 2 Draw and Kick Coach Schilling teaches
              the offensive contact of &quot;creating an opening by driving at
              gaps or driving at defensive players&quot;.&nbsp; He also clearly
              identifies a critical teaching point, that penetration is only
              effective if you draw help on balance.&nbsp; Coach Rey fires back
              on the defensive end that you want to &quot;defend 3 feet to your
              right and 3 feet to your left&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can do
              that you decrease the pressure put on help defenders bailing you
              out, and reduce the number of times an attacking team gets a kick
              out for an open score.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>

              <p><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Continuing
              on, there are more drills including&nbsp; 2 on 2 Post Feed
              (emphasis: teaching how to get the ball into the post and what to
              do off the pass), 2 on 2 Pick &amp; Roll (emphasis: how to score
              out of pick and roll against various defensive options), and 2 on
              2 Trap Passing (emphasis: handling trap pressure on the
              ball).&nbsp; Each of these three drills are extremely useful tools
              for teaching these various points of emphasis.&nbsp; In teaching
              how to handle the trap Coach Rey tells the offensive PG
              &quot;bring the ball immediately low as a trap approaches to bring
              the defenders low thus creating passing lanes high.&quot;&nbsp;
              Coach Schilling exhorts the defense to &quot;approach the trap
              keeping the hands high now matter what the offensive PG does and
              create and L to prevent the split of the trap.&quot;&nbsp; Keeping
              the hands <img border="0" src="../../../../images/Reviews/take_them_close_to.gif" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5">high
              prevents any quick direct pass and forces the attacker to either
              throw a slower bounce pass out of the trap, or a high floating
              pass both of which can be picked off by an alert defense.</span></font></p>
              <p><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">In
              the drill 2 on 2 Pull Back and Pass (emphasis: sucking up a trap
              to create a split or pass out against pressure) players are taught
              to &quot;keep the ball away from the coffin corner and suck the
              trap up across the half-court line then proceeding to attack the
              lead defender or pass out.&quot;&nbsp; Coach Rey on defense says
              when the offense does this, quickly close up the separation
              &quot;and pressure the dribble hand to quickly close the trap and
              avoid getting split&quot;.</span></font></p>

              this 75 minute video nears the end you are also introduced to a 3
              on 3 Screening Drills for PG's (emphasis: teaching the point to
              get involved after entering the offense by screening a teammate)
              which is a useful drill to keep your PG's active and
              involved.&nbsp; We were extremely entertained and educated by all
              of the 1 on 1 and 2 on 2 drills, however to be honest this was the
              one drill that lacked significant teaching bite from our
              perspective.&nbsp; The Coach's do make an important point when
              they state &quot;the better screen you can set, the more open you
              will get&quot; which can't be overlooked, but this particular
              drill missed some of the powerful teaching points that we found in
              virtually all the other drills in this video..</span></font></p>
              <p><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">The
              last drill you are presented is a 2 on 1 to 1 on 2 Sprint Recovery
              Drill (emphasis:&nbsp; immediate transition from offensive to
              defense and vice versa) which is a fairly common basketball
              drill.&nbsp;&nbsp; This drill unlike the previous one we just
              discussed was full of useful teaching points for attacking the
              basket 2 on 1, and then how to turn right around and get open and
              up the court against essentially a full court double
              team.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>

              the Team</i> finishes with a summary look at critical concepts
              your point must learn to become a great point guard.&nbsp; These
              include things like work ethic, conflict resolution between
              teammates, court understanding, getting players involved, knowing
              the flow of the game, closing out games, accepting responsibility,
              and being a coach on the floor.&nbsp; There is no question that
              the points they raise and in combination with the skill points
              they are teaching here make this a must video for coaches that
              need significant help teaching guard play.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
              <h3><font size="1" color="#FF6600"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Sum
              is More Than the Parts</span></font></h3>
              <p><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">What
              most coaches realize is that with any great team the sum of the
              players as a team is greater than the individual achievement of
              any one player.&nbsp; Coach Schilling and Rey have done a superb
              job taking many key aspects of teaching point guard play and
              putting it into an exciting, fast paced, information rich, and
              practical format that will stretch your thinking about how you
              teach this position.&nbsp; While most guard video's focus on the
              actual skills and drills to enhance those skills, <i>Running the
              Team</i> takes the approach what team type skills are required and
              then works backward through the drills to insure that you are
              building more than a ball handling point guard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
              <p><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">After
              viewing this video you will clearly understand the need to develop
              a PG's capability to handle pressure, create and execute entry
              into offenses, handle trap pressure, post passing, and creating
              openings for teammates through penetration and pitch (what some
              coaches call drive and kick).&nbsp; We also were impressed by the
              focus put on a point guard making immediate court transition both
              from offense to defense and vice versa a hidden but critical skill
              to creating or defending numbers.&nbsp; These coaches know what
              they are talking about and you are the lucky recipient of that
              knowledge.&nbsp; We happily give this video 5 hoops out of&nbsp; 5
              and think you will find that in the years to come <i>Running the
              Team </i>will become a standard for teaching point guard play,
              emphasizing both offensive and defensive skills as part of
              becoming the whole package.&nbsp; It's creative, innovative,
              technically accurate, and a healthy 75 minutes powerfully fun
              instruction.&nbsp; What more could a coach want to help them
              develop a successful point guard.</span></font></p>
