<center><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Haldane's Comments from "The
Cost of Natural Selection" Indicating that Two Species Could be Expected
to Differ by Only One to Two Thousand Substitutions</font></font></center>

<p><b><font color="#000099">[From page 521 of "The Cost of Natural Selection."

<br>We do not know how many loci two 'good' but fairly closely related
species differ. <b>Their taxonomic characters may depend mainly on as few
as twenty gene substitutions</b>. But there is every reason to think that
substitutions have occurred at a great many other loci. <b><font color="#000099">[Haldane
continues the paragraph with a discussion of the viabilities of 18 recessive
mutations studied by Punnett in Lathyrus odoratus and how the viability
of these mutations seemed to be increasing with time (the older mutations
invariably had higher viabilities than the newer mutations). Haldane felt
that this was due to the accumulation of modifiers (genes at other loci)&nbsp;
that improved the viability of the 18 visible mutations. This was Haldane's
justification for claiming that even though twenty mutations might explain
the taxonomic character differences between two species, substitutions
may have occurred at a great many other loci.]</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000099">[In the following paragraph, Haldane begins...]</font></b>
<br>Presumably the same kind of process occurs in evolution. The number
of loci in a vertebrate species has been estimated at about 40,000. <b>'Good'
species, even when closely related, may differ at several thousand loci</b>,
even if the differences at most of them are very slight. But it takes as
many deaths, or their equivalents, to replace a gene by one producing a
barely distinguishable phenotype as by one producing a very different one.
If two species differ at 1000 loci, and the mean rate of gene substitution,
as has been suggested, is one per 300 generations, it will take 300,000
generations to generate an interspecific difference. It may take a good
deal more, for if an allele a1 is replaced by a10, the population may pass
through stages where the commonest genotype is a1a1, a2a2, a3a3, and so
on, successively, the various alleles in turn giving maximal fitness in
the existing existing environment and the residual environment.&nbsp; Simpson
(1953) finds the mean life of a genus of Carnivora to be about 8 million
years. That of a species in horotelic vertebrate evolution may average
about a million.
<p>Zeuner (1945), after a very full discussion of the Pleistocene fossil
record, concluded that in mammals, about 500,000 years were required for
the evolution of a new species, though in the mole genera <i>Mimomys</i>
and <i>Arvicola</i> the rate was somewhat greater. Some insects seem to
have evolved at about the same rate, while other insects, and all molluscs,
evolved more slowly. He estimated the total duration of the Pleistocene
at 600,000 years, but some later authors would about halve that figure
<b><font color="#000099">[note
that these assumptions turned out to be quite wrong - the duration of the
Pleistocene has been firmly established at over 1.5 million years in the
years since Haldane wrote this]</font></b>. On the other hand, changes
during the Pleistocene were unusually rapid, and evolution, therefor, also
probably unusually rapid. <b>The agreement with the theory here developed
is satisfactory.</b>
<p><b><font color="#000099">[To me, this last sentence seems to indicate
that Haldane saw no problem with his estimated rate of 1 substitution per
300 generations and the rate of evolution inferred from the fossil record.
Additionally, Haldane seems satisfied that one to two thousand substitutions
would be sufficient to differentiate two close species. Since 1,667 (the
approximate number of substitutional differences expected between humans
and chimpanzees if it has been 5 million years since they shared a common
ancestor) substitutions falls well within this range, it appears that Haldane
would have seen no problem with this number of substitutional differences
between humans and chimpanzees. His arguments concerning multiple substitutions
at the same locus seem weak since he is talking about substitutions at
1,667 of 40,000 loci (that works out to about 1 substitution per 24 loci)
, there is no reason to expect that there would be a great deal of multiple
substitutions at the same locus. At any rate, Haldane made no effort to
quantify either the number of serial substitutions that would be expected
at a single locus nor the number of modifiers that would be expected to
raise the number of genes required to explain the taxonomic differences
between to good but fairly closely related species from twenty all the
way up to one to two thousand.]</font></b>
