<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The "hyper-" prefix means <em>beyond</em>, and can refer to space which
is <em>very large</em> or <em>very small</em>.   But "hyperspace" in these
essays refers to the necessarily curved S<sup>3</sup> space on the "surface"
of the V<sup>4</sup> Riemannian hypersphere defined <a href="hierarchy(1).html#table">in the
beginning table</a> of Essay #1.   By definition, the lower-dimensional circle
and spherical surface are <em>embedded</em> in this curved space, and the
formula which defines it also includes an antipode.    
<p> </p>
<blockquote> <font color="red"> [<strong>Note:</strong> This is a rather
different definition than you usually see because "hyperspace" refers more
often to the small packets of "compactified" space in the string theory.
  And in recent years, "hyperspace" has also come to mean the environment
in which the world wide web operates.   Remember that I'm confining the use
of "hyperspace" <em>exclusively</em> to  S<sup>3</sup> space.] </font> </blockquote>
 
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Our objective in this second essay is quite simple<strong>:</strong>
 we assume that we can look out along the spherical surface as far as - and
even <em>beyond</em> - its opposite side and that what we observe there is
subject to the laws of physics as we understand them.   It's a very simple exercise that hardly anyone has bothered to do because nearly everybody accepts the argument at Ned Wright's site mentioned <A HREF="App1.html">in Appendix 1</A>.
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>  The assumption for the last decade or two has been that if the universe
is not <em>precisely</em> Euclidean (or flat), it probably doesn't miss by
very much.   It is only in the last few years that speculation about curved
space has been resurrected and is comparable to what it was decades ago,
in spite of what many researchers regard as irrefutable evidence favoring
the flat model in V<sup>3</sup>. <a name="3">   </a> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <blockquote> <font color="red"> <a href="App4.html">[Appendix 4</a> gives
the flavor of what two eminent scientists - Willem de Sitter and Albert Einstein
- wrote about curved space early in the twentieth century.   As <a href="App5.html">
Appendix 5</a> mentions several more recent references to models with an
antipode, the following analysis is <em>not</em> necessarily irrelevant.] 
    </font></blockquote>
  
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> When analyzing how an antipode will affect our observations, it's
important to remember two basic rules in topology<strong>:</strong> (1) the
opposite side of an "embedded" spherical surface corresponds to the antipode
of the higher-dimensional hypersphere and (2) whatever happens <em>on</em>
 the spherical surface also happens <em>at right angles</em> to the surface
(a result derived in the <a href="App2.html">Appendix 2</a> link in the previous
essay). </p>
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> So in order to find out what happens in S<sup>3</sup>, we examine
first what happens in S<sup>2</sup>.   Once you understand that, it's a simple
matter of following the (topo)logical "yellow brick road".  <a name="clouds">
  </a> </p>
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> So what happens to our observations if we <em>do</em> look toward
an antipode?  </p>
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Suppose we're at the north pole of a spherical surface and that
light is confined to the surface.   There is a cloud nearby that we can move
along any line of longitude as far as, and even beyond, the south pole. 
 As we move the cloud away, at first it seems to become smaller, as expected,
but <em>only</em> until it reaches the equator.   Once we move the cloud
into the southern hemisphere, it starts to appear <strong>larger</strong>
 from our vantage point at the north pole.   And if the cloud would just
happen to lie over the south pole, it would stretch all the way around our
horizon, since we always look toward the south pole in every direction from
the north pole.  </p>
      <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Therefore objects actually pass through a <em>maximum in size</em>
 as they approach the opposite side of a spherical surface, which corresponds
to the antipode of the hypersphere.  </p>
      <blockquote> <font color="red"> [<a href="absorbers.html">Essay #8</a>
 on "absorbers" suggests there may be some practical applications of this
principle about cloud size near an antipode.] </font> </blockquote>
 
        <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Next what happens to our perception of <em>luminous</em> objects
near the antipode? </p>
        <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>We'll simply repeat the previous thought experiment, using a
flashlight instead of a cloud.   Here we'll assume<strong>:</strong> (1)
the flashlight is nearby, aimed right at us, and moves along the same line
of longitude the cloud does, (2) each side of the flashlight's beam follows
a great circle (geodesic) around the surface, and (3) the relative brightness
of the flashlight varies inversely as the width of the beam when it reaches
our position at the north pole.  </p>
        <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>At first the flashlight appears fainter with increasing distance
because the beam is getting wider when it reaches us.   However, the beam
ceases to become wider with increasing distance once the flashlight crosses
the equator.   Instead the beam gradually becomes narrower when it arrives
at our north pole position, which means the flashlight is starting to appear
        <strong>brighter</strong>.   And it will continue to get <strong>
brighter</strong> with increasing distance until we move it "beyond" the
south pole. <a name="x">  </a> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <blockquote><font color="red">[It's rather easy to attach some hard
numbers to how large and how bright an object will become in hyperspace it
it approaches the antipode.   But I prefer not to clutter up this (main)
essay with what most of you would consider a footnote.   If you're interested,
          <a href="App6.html">Appendix 6</a> provides a short discussion
on how the curvature of hyperspace would affect our perception of an object's
size and luminosity.] </font> </blockquote>
    
          <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> To use another example, suppose we had a number of candles
with standard luminosity evenly  distributed over a spherical surface.  
If we were at the north pole and could look as far as, and even beyond, the
south pole, how would we perceive this distribution of candles?  </p>
          <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> From our vantage point at the north pole, the candles would
appear to get brighter as we looked toward the south pole, but there would
be fewer of them as we looked toward this position (because we're looking
into and then out of a smaller area).   The number counts would start to
pick up again once we looked beyond the south pole, and the candles would
start to appear fainter again.   Thus these "standard candles" would pass
through a <em>maximum</em> in luminosity at the south pole where they would
also pass through a <em>minimum</em> in the number counts. </p>
          <blockquote> <font color="red"> [And if you think this is just
another irrelevant thought experiment without any practical application,
you will see that the quasar distribution exhibited <a href="qta.html">in
Essay #7</a> fits this prediction tolerably well.] </font> </blockquote>
 
            <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> A similar thought experiment reveals that any lateral movement
- called "proper motion" in astronomy - will appear <em>exaggerated</em>
if it occurs near the opposite side of a spherical surface or the antipode
of a hypersphere.    <a name="5">  </a> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <blockquote> <font color="red"> [Most likely, you realize intuitively
this is correct and, again, I prefer not to clutter up this file by providing
the introductory analysis.   However, <a href="App7.html">Appendix 7</a>
mentions lateral movement of objects near the antipode and how it might affect
"counterimages", that is, images that would be seen in two <em>exactly</em>
 opposite directions, were it not for lateral movement which could <em>distort</em>
 the alignment. A few other less significant factors affecting the alignment
of counterimages are mentioned at the start of Appendix 7.  The effect is
worth noting even if there aren't counterimages.]  </font> </blockquote>
 
              <p> Therefore if we're looking past an antipode, discrete luminous
objects actually pass through a <em>maximum in size, luminosity,</em> and
(lateral) <em>velocity</em>.   We could say that the curvature of space near
the antipode is behaving essentially like a <font color=navy><strong>gigantic lens</strong></font>, causing objects in its vicinity to appear <font color=navy><strong>larger</strong></font>, <font color=navy><strong>brighter</strong></font>, and to move across our field of view <font color=navy><strong>faster</strong></font> than they would at the equivalent distance in the conventional Euclidean ("normal") universe in V<sup>3</sup> <em>without</em> an antipode.  <a name="6">   </a> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote><font color="red"> [If the preceding seems strange,
others who have analyzed the problem have derived exactly the same results.
  The abstracts of their analyses are presented <a href="App8.html">in Appendix
8</a>.   Note the last abstract by J. Soucek in which he describes a "law
of fictitious magnification", which is his version of the "gigantic lens" metaphor above.] </font> </blockquote>
 
                <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> If we <em>did</em> observe discrete objects <em>very
near</em> an antipode, we would probably attach prefixes like <em>"ultra-",
"super-",</em> and <em>"hyper-"</em> to the adjectives describing them. 
 (Hint: some of these prefixes <em>are</em> used to describe certain objects
in deep space, such as "ultraluminous" and "superluminal".) </p>
                <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Obviously in just a few minutes we've derived some very
unusual phenomena that <em>never</em> happen in ordinary Euclidean space.
 </p>
                <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> <strong>NEVER!</strong>  </p>
                <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Our best chance to <em>find</em> an antipode to look
for a variety of observations that seem unusual in a spherical universe<strong>:</strong> <strong>larger, brighter, faster</strong>.   If these anomalies
occur consistently at the same red shift, they <em>might</em> be clues suggesting
an antipode.
  <a name="minimum">  </a> </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Astronomers and cosmologists recognize that discrete objects pass through
a  <strong>minimum</strong> in luminosity and size.   This minimum occurs,
for instance, at a red  shift (z) of 1.25 in a Friedmann universe with critical
density in V<sup>3</sup>.   If we change the assumptions, incorporating the
most reasonable estimates of the the Hubble parameter (70), relative density
(0.3), and a cosmological constant (0.7), discrete objects pass through a
minimum in size and luminosity at around z = 1.62.
<p>
  
                <blockquote>
                <font color="red">
[Curiously, both red shifts are about 70% of the total distance from here to the singularity in
their respective models.   While I'm jumping the gun just a little, <a href="App9.html#minimum">Appendix 9</a> links you to a site which tells you how to determine where objects are passing though a
minimum.] </font> <br>
                  </blockquote>
 
                  <div align="Left">
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Thus the relevant question in the "closed
cosmic hypersphere" is whether one or more objects are passing  through a <strong>maximum</strong>
 in luminosity, size, and velocity at an even higher red shift (and perhaps
a <em>minimum</em> in the number counts).   If they give some evidence of
doing this, then we have some clues suggesting an antipode, which is most
likely to occur in S<sup>3</sup>.   (As mentioned before, an antipode <em>
could occur</em> in the closed Friedmann model in V<sup>3</sup> with very
high density, although the chances of a such a "heavy" universe are almost
nil.)  <br>
                  </div>
                  <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>So an object near this hypothetical antipode should
have unusual traits which will be obvious to an observer on the "opposite
side" of the hypersphere.   It will seem very large, very bright, and/or
move across our field of view very fast.  </p>
                  <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>One of the most interesting aspects of finding an antipode
is that it clearly indicates that space is "multiply-connected", just like
a spherical surface is, except in another dimension (again, a trait resulting
from "<a href="hierarchy(1).html#embeddedness">embeddedness</a>").   An object
slightly closer than the antipode in one direction - probably with one or
more observational anomalies - can, in theory, be seen in the opposite direction, 
presumably with similar peculiar behavior. </p>
                  <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Thus, for example, unusually bright quasars or galaxies
might be seen in opposite directions <em>provided</em> their anomalies are
caused by their proximity to an unsuspected antipode.   These images in opposite
directions are called "counterimages" and they are most likely to be detected
near the "counterpoint" (i.e., antipode).   It should come as no surprise
that this has been tried from time to time, so far without success (as the
abstract linked to in the second item of <a href="App7.html"> Appendix 7</a>
 indicates).
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The possibility of counterimages is discussed once more at the end <A  HREF="qta.html">of Essay #7</A></p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Next, within the big bang model, what assumption
gives us Riemannian S<sup>3</sup> space with at least <em>one</em> antipode between
here and the singularity? </p>
                  <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Essay #3 answers this question. </p>
