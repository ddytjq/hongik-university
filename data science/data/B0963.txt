      <p>You have a choice of repayment methods:</p>
      <p><STRONG class="redtext">Repayment</STRONG><br>
      Each month you pay both the interest on the loan and part of the capital 
        so that your Prospect Mortgage is repaid in full by the end of the agreed 
        term.</p>
      <p><STRONG class="redtext">Interest Only</STRONG><br>
      With this option your monthly payments are lower because they only cover 
        the interest on your loan. However, the amount you borrow remains outstanding 
        and will have to be repaid at the end of the term. You will need the funds 
        available to repay the capital from another source such as an ISA, endowment 
        policy or personal pension plan. Your can also repay the amount borrowed 
        from your own personal resources.</p>
      <p><STRONG class="redtext">Protecting your Mortgage</STRONG><br>
      With both a repayment mortgage and an interest only mortgage, life assurance 
        should be arranged so that loan is repaid in the event of your death.</p>
      <p><STRONG class="redtext">Early Repayment</STRONG><br>
      <STRONG>If you repay a Prospect Mortgage, or make an early repayment of capital, 
        interest will be payable up to the end of the month in which the repayment 
        is made. If such repayment is made within the first 5 years of the mortgage 
        term, an additional fee of 3% of the sum repaid will be charged unless 
        the mortgage is simultaneously replaced with a new Chelsea mortgage on 
        a different property.</STRONG></p>
      <p><STRONG class="redtext">Typical Example</STRONG><br>
      This example is based on a Prospect Interest Only Mortgage (Scheme 1) 
        of &pound;50,000 (purchase price/valuation &pound;57,000) and a term of 
        25 years (300 monthly payments), at a rate of 5.94% (<STRONG><font size="3">6.1%</font> 
        <acronym title="Annual Percentage Rate">APR</acronym></STRONG> variable) and including an addition of 0.25% for the first 2 years.</p>

      </table>
      <p>The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) includes an administration fee of &pound;245, 
        of which &pound;195 is payable on application and the balance is deducted 
        from the mortgage advance, an estimate of the Society's legal costs of 
        &pound;180, a discharge fee of &pound;50, and an arrangement fee of &pound;295 
        which in the example was paid by the borrower. You have the choice of 
        having the arrangement fee added to or deducted from the loan - interest 
        is payable on fees added to the loan. A lending risk fee, which reflects 
        the higher risk to the Society of larger percentage loans, is required 
        where the loan exceeds 80% of the price or valuation of the property (whichever 
        is lower). Where a lending risk fee is charged, it will apply from 75% 
        of the price or valuation (whichever is lower). A single payment lending 
        risk fee of &pound;478.50 is included in the APR calculation.</p>
      <p>The APR, monthly payment figures and total amount payable are based on 
        the current rate of 5.94%, being an addition of 0.25% on the prevailing 
        standard variable rate for the first 2 years and the Society's current 
        standard variable rate of 5.69% for the remainder of the term. It has 
        been assumed that each of these rates will apply for the whole of the 
        periods to which they relate and they are based on our current standard 
        variable rate. However the rates may well be different at the relevant 
        times and will rise and fall throughout the term. The total amount payable 
        figures include repayment of the loan at the end of the term. <STRONG>A means 
        of repayment of the loan will need to be arranged.</STRONG></p>
