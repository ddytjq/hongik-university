<br /><h1>
  Mortgage Payment Cover</h1>
<a name="whymortgagecover">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="faqquestion">Q. Why do I need Mortgage PaymentCover? </p>
<p class="faqanswer">A. Buying a home is one of the 
  biggest financial commitments you will ever make. But with all the excitement 
  of buying a new home it's easy to forget that life can change.If you lost your 
  income you would still need to meet your mortgage payments or face the possibility 
  of losing your home.</p>

<p class="faqanswer">That's why we recommend you protect 
  your mortgage payments with Alliance &amp; Leicester's Mortgage PaymentCover 
  policy. With Mortgage PaymentCover, should you lose your income through no fault 
  of your own your mortgage payments would be paid tax free* for up to 12 months, 
  giving you ample time to recover from your accident or illness - or find a new 
  job!</p>
<a name="statepaymortgage">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="faqquestion">Q. Will the State pay my mortgage if I can't?
<p class="faqanswer">A. Not necessarily. You must be out of work for 9 months 
  before the State will help with your mortgage payments** via Income Support 
  for Mortgage Interest (ISMI).<br />
  Even then you may not be eligible for help if:</p>
<p class="faqanswer">Your partner works for 24 hours a week or more, you will 
  not be eligible for State support with your mortgage payments.</p>
<ul>
  <li class="faqanswer">You and/or your partner have more than &pound;8,000 savings. 
    In this case you won't receive any help with your mortgage payments. Even 
    if you only have between &pound;3,000 and &pound;8,000 of savings your benefits 
    will be reduced.</li>
  <li class="faqanswer">If you do qualify for ISMI the amount of benefit you receive 
    may not be sufficient to meet you mortgage commitments.</li>
</ul>
<p class="faqanswer">Mortgage assistance is only available for your mortgage interest 
  leaving you to meet the cost of your capital repayment or endowment policy.</p>
<p class="faqanswer">This is why we strongly recommend you protect your mortgage 
  commitments by taking out Mortgage PaymentCover.</p>
<a name="eligibleforpaymentcover">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="faqquestion">Q. Am I eligible for Mortgage PaymentCover? 
<p class="faqanswer">A. Yes, provided:</p>
<ul class="faqanswer">
  <li>You have an Alliance &amp; Leicester mortgage and it is within 90 days of 
    the completion of your mortgage or further loan.</li>
  <li>You are aged 18 or over, but under 65.</li>
  <li>You are employed for at least 16 hours a week in the U.K., Channel Islands, 
    Isle of Man, Southern Ireland or European Community and have been so continuously 
    for the past 3 months.</li>
  <li> You have the right to live permanently in the U.K., Channel Islands or 
    Isle of Man.</li>
</ul>
<p class="faqanswer"> You are also eligible if:
<ul class="faqanswer">
  <li> You are employed by the British Armed Forces, British Embassy or Consulate.</li>
  <li> Your employer is a United Kingdom registered company and you are assigned 
    to work within the European Union.</li>
</ul>
<a name="howmuchcover">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="faqquestion">Q. How much cover can I take out?
<p class="faqanswer">A. You can cover not only your monthly mortgage payments, 
  but also your mortgage related bills such as your home insurance, endowment 
  and Mortgage PaymentCover premiums (up to a maximum of &pound;2,000). Not only 
  that, you can also opt for additional cover to pay your regular bills, such 
  as gas and electricity.</p>
<p class="faqanswer">If you have a joint mortgage you can both be covered for 
  one premium. You can even choose how the benefit is split between you. So, if 
  you were covered for 80% of the benefit and your partner for 20%, if you lost 
  your job you would receive 80% of the monthly benefit. If you both needed to 
  make a claim then you would receive 100% of the benefit between you.</p>
<p class="faqanswer">You decide how much cover you need.*** So if your monthly 
  mortgage commitments change due to interest rate changes, taking out a further 
  loan, or coming to the end of a fixed rate or discounted period, you can alter 
  your Mortgage PaymentCover to suit your needs.</p>
<a name="selfemployed">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="faqquestion">Q. I'm self-employed, what's in it for me?
<p class="faqanswer">A.  
  If you are self-employed you are still eligible for Mortgage PaymentCover. You 
  will not only be covered for accident or sickness, but also for unemployment 
  if you have to cease trading because your business has insufficient assets to 
  meet its debts and liabilities and you can provide evidence of this.</p>
<a name="contractworkers">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="faqquestion">Q. Can contract workers apply?
<p class="faqanswer">A.  
  Yes. Not only are you covered for accident or sickness but also if you become 
  unemployed before the expiry of your fixed term contract. You can even claim 
  if your fixed term contract is not renewed, providing you have worked for the 
  same employer on either an annual contract which has been renewed at least once, 
  or a contract for at least 24 months, prior to being made unemployed. Cover 
  is even available if you have been employed by the same employer for at least 
  6 months and your contract has been renewed at least twice, although you will 
  only be entitled to benefit for unemployment if your contract is terminated 
  early and benefit will cease at the end of the contract term.</p>
<a name="howdoesitwork">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="faqquestion">Q. So how does it work?
<p class="faqanswer">A. Once you are off work for 30 consecutive days or more 
  Mortgage PaymentCover will start to pay monthly benefit. And with the benefits 
  being calculated on a daily basis if you return to work part way through a month, 
  you would still receive benefit for the time you were off. </p>
<p class="faqanswer">You can receive up to 12 months benefit per claim. Full details 
  are given in the Statement of Cover which is available upon request. A copy 
  will be sent to you when you are accepted for cover.</p>
<a name="ifImove">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="faqquestion">Q. What if I move?
<p class="faqanswer">A.  
  Mortgage PaymentCover moves with you, providing you keep us informed, so you 
  can even change your mortgage lender without affecting the policy.</p>
<a name="howmuch">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="faqquestion">Q. How much does it cost?
<p class="faqanswer">A. Not as much as you might think. Cover costs just &pound;5.25 
  per &pound;100 of monthly benefit (including Insurance Premium Tax), with premiums 
  collected monthly by Direct Debit for your convenience. So if for example you 
  wanted to cover your mortgage and related premiums for &pound;300 per month, 
  your monthly Mortgage PaymentCover premium would be &pound;15.75, that's less 
  than 50p a day.</p>
<p class="faqanswer">A personalised quotation and full policy details including 
  terms and conditions are available from us on request.</p>
<p class="faqanswer">* Subject to existing legislation</p>
<p class="faqanswer">**If mortgage taken out after 1st October 1995</p>
<p class="faqanswer">*** Taking benefits in excess of your mortgage payment, endowment, 
  buildings insurance and premiums for this policy may affect your entitlement 
  to means tested State Benefits, although Contribution based Jobseekers Allowance 
  is not means tested &amp; therefore would not be affected. </p>

<p class="faqquestion">Q. Can I protect my no claims discount?</p><p class="faqanswer"> 
  A. Yes you can. Unlike other companies who allow you to protect your no claims 
  after 5 years, you can actually protect your no claims discount after 4 years 
  if you are 25 years or over.
