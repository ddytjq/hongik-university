<FONT SIZE=5><P>&#9;ONE LAST SWING</P>
</B></FONT>
<P>&#9;As a baseball chronicler of sorts, I have to add at least a few words here to the thousands or millions that have been written in tribute to Ted Williams.</P>

<P>&#9;But they will come later. After a serendipitous visit to Fenway (via television, this time), and an even more coincidental contribution, <I>Teddy at the Bat</I>. This poem was first recited by Dick Flavin for Ted Williams, Dom DiMaggio, and Johnny Pesky at Ted Williams' home in Hernando, Florida, October 23, 2001, by Dick Flavin. Dick did it again last June 29 at the SABR Convention in Boston, and it came to my attention, thanks to Bill Nowlin, who gave me the OK to include it here in <B>NOTES</B>. If you want more information, contact Dick Flavin by calling 617-645-8008 or e-mailing him at <B>dickflavin@hotmail.com</B>. </P>

<P>&#9;The main piece in this issue grew out of a correction of something I wrote in passing, really, in <I>Notes 261</I> about Minnie Minoso. I take no credit for the research -- that belongs to Tim Wiles and an intern (or two) to be named later (I hope -- I like to give credit where it is due -- <I>not easy</I>.) But I had great fun putting it all together. I think you will enjoy reading the full story, as perhaps never told before, about Minnie Minoso and his quest for <I>one last swing</I>.</P>

<P>&#9;I mentioned Shoeless Joe Jackson last time, too. And I want to follow up on that, by directing you to The Shoeless Joe Jackson Virtual Hall of Fame: <B>www.blackbetsy.com</B>. This web site was developed by Mike Nola, whose e-mail address is <B>shoeless@blackbetsy.com</B>. Guess where he stands on whether Joe oughtta be in Cooperstown?  Hey, didn't Ted suggest that once? Thanx to Terry Cannon for the info on TSJJVHOF, as well as for some more material in the Minnie Minoso piece.</P>

<I><P>&#9;One last swing</I>. We can only imagine how many times Ted yearned for that ... just like Joe Jackson, after he was banished ... just like Minnie Minoso, when he politely asked for one more at bat. Ted made his final swing a punctuation mark to end his long and successful career. Did his dream come true? Do most fans recall him as the game's greatest hitter? Well, he is probably in most fans' Top Ten, for sure. Arguing this can be fun. Like arguing Who was/is the greatest baseball writer. Stats do not help (most books published? most number of words written?) I must return to this intriguing problem at some future date. Maybe after I hang up my computer, and long for one last swing.</P>

<B><U><P>AT THE FEN   </P>
</B></U>
<P>&#9;I heard about The Fenway Project on the SABR-L digest, and was instantly intrigued. I believe the idea was Bill Nowlin's. Bill has authored a number of books, including <I>Ted Williams: A Tribute</I>, with Jim Prime (Masters Press, 1997), and Bill hoped The Fenway Project might produce one more.</P>

<P>&#9;If it works, it could produce a whole series of books. Here is the plot: (a) annual national SABR convention, usually in city with major league franchise; (b) part of convention is attendance at a ball game (or more, if other parks are within reach); (c) why not ask the several hundred SABR members who attend, to write about it?  This will produce a kaleidoscope of viewpoints from some of the most rabid, and most informed fans, on the planet. There will be stat-rats and record experts, literary folks and fans with a long history with one or both of the teams on the diamond -- just about any brand of fan you can imagine.</P>

<P>&#9;This year, the SABR national was in Boston; as luck would have it, the Braves were in town. Bill had opened The Fenway Project up to include SABR members who heard the game on radio or watched it on TV, so, thanx to TBS, I was able to participate. I don't think it was the most exciting game I've ever seen, but here is how I responded to the invitation of writing up something worthy of inclusion in a future book.</P>

<B><P>&#9;* * * * *</P>
</B>
<P>&#9;It felt like a homework assignment, and watching a baseball game should not have that feel. But I liked the randomness of the thing -- I will probably watch on television very few games, any summer, from beginning to end, so doing this (for a good cause) was fun anyway.</P>

<P>&#9;Being a close follower on neither the Braves nor the Red Sox, I wasn't sure if this was the first time that the Braves had played in Beantown since they left for Milwaukee, after the 1952 season. I soon learned that it was not; Atlanta's Braves were 9-3 at the Fen going into this June 28 contest. Ah, well, maybe something else would make the night historic. </P>

<P>&#9;That's one of the things I love about baseball -- you never know. In any game, fans can witness something that either never happened before, or hasn't happened since -- (race to record books) -- 1909!  <I>And only three times since 1888!</P>
</I>
<P>&#9;But this was not that kind of night. For a while, it looked like <I>maybe </I>Keith Lockhart, the visitors' second baseman, might set a new record for assists in a game -- he got two in the first and third innings, three in the fourth (in the middle of a streak of five straight 4-3's), and when the first Boston hitter bounced one his way to open the sixth, he had ten. But that was it, and Lockhart was pulled before the game ended anyway.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;This was my first close look at these two teams this season. Of course I knew that they were both doing very well in 2002. I am a NL fan, but I almost always root against the Braves, and for the Sox. Hey, I'm from Pittsburgh, and we have a thing with the Braves since the early nineties, and we like underdogs.</P>

<P>&#9;Few of <I>these</I> Braves were around back then -- Glavine and Smoltzy were; but I recognized most of them, because I do tune in TBS from time to time, even when not on assignment. There was Julio Franco at first, where my memory still sees Sid Bream and Fred McGriff and Andres Galarraga (I still look up the spelling, it's just a blind spot) ... Gary Sheffield at DH (which I like), forever in memory as the former Padre whose trade caused lawsuits in San Diego ... the smug but talented Jones boys ... Vinny Castilla. And on the hill, Greg Maddux, the ex-Cub Factor, once an unhittable ace, reduced to damn tough humanity.</P>

<P>&#9;For the home team, I was pleased to get my first long look at Johnny Damon; he came into the game at .322 but swallowed an 0-fer in the leadoff spot. Carlos Baerga fared better this night, and I was glad to hear he is indeed having a good summer; once a sure-Hall-of-Famer, he had had hard times, and I'd lost touch. Nomar, Manny (back, but still not right) ... and Trot Nixon, a fellow I caught on his way up, down in Durham.</P>

<P>&#9;I kept score of the game, which the Braves won 4-2, and my main recollection is that it was mostly dull -- if you like offense. Maddux and Burkett dueled well, then Greg had to leave after five; Burkett lasted seven. It went into the ninth tied 2-2, then the Braves squeezed two across with two out. The hero was Castilla, who was working hard to avoid an 0-for-5 (but his hit in the sixth, snagged by Nixon in right, rated the only star in my scorebook.)</P>

<P>&#9;The Braves winning outburst came against Tim Wakefield, who was described by one of the announcers as a "nemesis."  And that took me back to 1992, when Wakefield dominated the Braves twice in the NL Playoffs. When Doug Drabek ran out of gas in Game Seven, more than a few Buc fans called for Wakefield to come in and deliver one more inning. But manager Leyland went with Stan Belinda, who (overachieving, I think) got a couple outs before Francisco Cabrera's hit scored Sid Bream -- Barry Bonds' throw being just late, just off the mark. Of course it all came back when Wakefield was called in to hold the Braves at bay.</P>

<P>&#9;But the Braves hit him this night -- as they might have done in 1992. Who knows? I forgave Jim Leyland a little bit after the game (the Sox went quietly in the home half.) It is not easy to forgive. Holding grudges, plotting revenge -- these are easy. The home team lost. "If they don't win, it's a shame."  But it's not a tragedy. There will always be tomorrow, and maybe something will happen in ten years that will take me back to <I>this</I> game. You never know.</P>

<B><U><P>IN MEMORY OF TED WILLIAMS   </P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">                          TEDDY AT THE BAT</P>
</B><P>           (With apologies to Ernest Lawrence Thayer)</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Red Sox nine that day,</P>
<P>The score stood four to two with but one inning left to play.</P>
<P>So when Stephens died at first and Tebbetts did the same</P>
<P>A pallor wreathed the features of the patrons of the game.</P>

<P>A straggling few got up to go, leaving there the rest</P>
<P>With he hope that springs eternal within the human breast.</P>
<P>They thought if only Teddy could get a whack at that –-</P>
<P>They'd put even money now with Teddy at the bat.</P>

<P>But Dom preceded Teddy and Pesky was on deck.</P>
<P>The first of them was in a slump. The other was a wreck.</P>
<P>So on that stricken multitude a deathlike silence sat,</P>
<P>For there seemed but little chance of Teddy's getting to the bat.</P>

<P>But Dom let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,</P>
<P>And Pesky, of all people, tore the cover off the ball.</P>
<P>When the dust had lifted, and they saw what had occurred,</P>
<P>There was Johnny safe on second and Dominic on third.</P>

<P>Then from that gladdened multitude went up a joyous yell,</P>
<P>It rumbled in the mountains and rattled in the dell.</P>
<P>It struck upon the hillside and rebounded on the flat,</P>
<P>For Teddy, Teddy Ballgame, was advancing to the bat.</P>

<P>There was ease in Teddy's manner as he stepped into his place,</P>
<P>There was pride in Teddy's bearing and a smile on Teddy's face.</P>
<P>And when, responding to the cheers he lightly doffed his hat,</P>
<P>&#9;(I'm making that part up)</P>
<P>No stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Teddy at the bat.</P>

<P>Ten thousand eyes were on him as he wiped his hands with dirt,</P>
<P>Five thousand tongues applauded as he wiped them on his shirt.</P>
<P>Then when the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,</P>
<P>Defiance gleamed in Teddy's eyes, a sneer curled Teddy's lip.</P>

<P>And now the leather covered sphere came hurtling through the air,</P>
<P>And Teddy stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.</P>
<P>Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped.</P>
<P>"That ain't my style," said Teddy. "Strike one!" the umpire said.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>From the benches black with people went up a muffled roar,</P>
<P>Like the beating of the storm waves on the stern and distant shore.</P>
<P>"Kill him! Kill the umpire!" someone shouted on the stand,</P>
<P>And it's likely they'd have killed him had not Teddy raised his hand.  </P>

<P>With a smile of Christian charity great Teddy's visage shown.</P>
<P>He stilled the rising tumult and bade the game go on.</P>
<P>He signaled the pitcher, and once more the spheroid flew.</P>
<P>But Teddy still ignored it, and the umpire said, "Strike two!"</P>

<P> "Fraud!" cried the maddened thousands, and the echo answered fraud.</P>
<P>But one scornful look from Teddy and the audience was awed.</P>
<P>They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,</P>
<P>And they knew that Teddy wouldn't let that ball go by again.</P>

<P>The sneer is gone from Teddy's lip; his teeth are clenched in hate.</P>
<P>He pounds with cruel vengeance his bat upon the plate.</P>
<P>And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,</P>
<P>And now the air is shattered by the force of Teddy's blow.</P>

<P>Oh, somewhere in this land of ours the sun is shining bright,</P>
<P>The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,</P>
<P>And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout.</P>
<P>And they're going wild at Fenway Park 'cause Teddy hit one out!</P>

<B><U><P>MINNIE MINOSO: WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?   </P>
</B></U><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&#9;... remember, [Minnie] wanted to play a few innings a few years ago, but was squashed by Selig and MLB?</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;-- <I>Notes #261       </P>
</I></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&#9;When I wrote the above in the last issue, commenting on Minnie Minoso's coming Induction (along with Shoeless Joe and Mark Fydrych) into The Shrine of the Eternals (Pasadena, CA), I received a prompt e-mail from David Shiner. David recollection was different than mine. He believe that Minnie did not get to bat -- making him the first player to swing in six different decades -- <I>not</I> because of Selig or MLB, but because his White Sox asked him not to. They were in a pennant race, and the stunt, although it would be a crowd-pleaser right up there with "Veeck's midget," Eddie Gaedel, would also be a distraction. So Minnie graciously bowed out.</P>

<P>&#9;My memory ain't what it used to be, but I really thought that Minnie had been sidelined by baseball officialdom, so I started asking around. Fortunately, one of those I asked was Tim Wiles, Mr Research (not his exact title) at the National Baseball Library (it's attached to that other baseball building in Cooperstown.)  And Tim promptly delivered a small collection of clippings to my mailbox. So, thanx to Tim and the intern who drew this important assignment, here is the skinny on Minnie.</P>

<P>&#9;In 1990, Minnie was all set to play the final game of the season in a White Sox uniform. A mere 67 (his age, not his number) at the time, Minnie was still in good shape. "I can still run and slide into a base," said Minnie. "I know every team in the big leagues has one guy who is slower than I am."  But let's back up some.</P>

<P>&#9;Born in Havana, Cuba, in 1922, Minnie broke into MLB with the Indians in 1949, a 27-year-old rookie. His ML career, started late, was nevertheless a success. Traded to the White Sox -- becoming their first black player -- in 1950 (and still a rookie), Minnie's first homer came in the same game as Mickey Mantle's first. In the fifties, Minnie consistently hit near or over .300, flashing speed and power and winning over fans. Although he was not in Chicago when the Go-Go Sox won the flag in '59, Bill Veeck gave Minnie a ring, anyway.</P>

<P>&#9;Minnie "retired" after the 1964 season, but, coaching for the White Sox, he returned for three games in 1976 (going 1-for-8), and was reactivated for two more games in 1980 (0-for-2.) So there was a tradition going here, and as long as Minnie stayed in shape -- which he did -- a 1990 appearance was scheduled.</P>

<P>&#9;Terry Cannon of The Baseball Reliquary tells me that in Minnie's 1994 autobiography, <I>Just Call Me Minnie</I>, when word got out, the White Sox received a fax from Fay Vincent, MLB's last real commissioner, which basically pulled the plug. Fay felt it would be a "travesty for baseball" and with the games' best interests always in mind, Fay just said No. When Minnie contacted the Commish's office for an explanation, Fay just said nothing. (The Great and Powerful Wizard of MLB had Spoken.)</P>

<P>&#9;Jerry Reinsdorf, ChiSox owner, said (to the AP) "We had never gotten to the point where we'd decided to let Minnie play, but now it's a moot point. Minnie had taken batting practice, and we had satisfied ourselves that he could have competed."</P>

<P>&#9;In the same AP story, Minnie expressed his disappointment. "Maybe the Commissioner will let me play in the year 2,000."  The AP could not have foreseen the way we'd write "2000," just as no one could have predicted the eventual squeezing out of the Commish and the replacement of a Commish by an owner.</P>

<P>&#9;The reactions to Vincent's veto in the print media at the time were mixed. Bob Greene wrote a column, objecting, and calling Vincent "a sad, dreary and humorless drone, until he proves himself otherwise."  Vincent <I>did</I> respond to Greene, demonstrating a sense of humor. In a phone conversation with Greene later, Vincent stated that he benched Minnie because he had to draw a line. "What if David Letterman wants to play for the Mariners for one out?"  Well, if I was Greene, I'd have brought up Gaedel. "Hey, Fay, did it kill the sport?" And in 1990, the fans needed some cheering -- having just gotten over the Pete Rose mess and the loss of Giamatti.</P>

<P>&#9;Malcolm Moran, in the <I>NY Times</I> (9/20/90), had been looking forward to Minnie at the bat. The White Sox had made a surprising run at Oakland, but were out of gas -- they would finish nine games out of it. Pete Rose was in jail, the owners were guilty of collusion, there had been another spring lockout -- letting Minnie swing seemed so trivial. "It would seem unlikely that the institution [of baseball] will be damaged by the presence of Saturino Orestes Armas Minoso at the age of 67," wrote Moran. "A case can be made that he is owed a little extra time, anyway."  In his last at bat, in 1980, Minnie had popped up -- and ran it out. "The integrity of the game is not hurt by a man who is eager to run out a pop-up."  Amen.</P>

<P>&#9;Jerome Holtzman, a respected Chicago writer on his way to becoming MLB's official historian -- a position one does not obtain by rocking boats -- weighed in with Vincent. "Sorry, Minnie, but baseball simply isn't a circus," was the title of his <I>Tribune</I> column (9/28/90.) He rightly distinguished between holding a record, and being an answer to a trivia question. (Nick Altrock also played in "just" five decades.) And Holtzman reported that the majority of fans polled disagreed with Vincent. "I can see both sides and understand the episode could be harmless, but big-league baseball is neither a circus nor the roller derby." Of course, he was writing before The Strike, and before interleague play. </P>

<P>&#9;Pete Coutros, writing in the <I>Daily News</I> (5/25/90), wrote at length about Minnie's struggle to get into MLB in the first place. MLB might have used the "stunt" of Minnie becoming "the man for <I>most</I> seasons" (Coutros) to remind fans of how players like Minnie and Satchel Paige and so many others had to contend with, uh, well, with MLB bureaucracy ... OK, with racism. </P>

<P>&#9;"MLB owes so much to so many great players who never got their one at bat in organized baseball, because of the color of their skin ... so let Minnie's at bat in Chicago symbolize that one at bat for all those to whom the national pastime can only say, we are truly sorry" -- that's what Vincent <I>might</I> have said. Alas, the words are mine, twelve years too late.</P>

<P>&#9;Then came Spring, 1991. To the rescue, Mike Veeck, Bill's son, now president of the Miami Miracle of the Class A Florida State League. Probably no one besides Minnie was more disappointed the previous fall, than Mike Veeck. So Mike asked Minnie to suit up for the Miracle and take "a swing or two" in a game on April 13. </P>

<P>&#9;It was going to be "3M Night" -- besides Minnie. Max Patkin and Morganna, the Kissing Bandit, were slated to appear. It was to be a night of fun -- what fan could pass it up? The game would be at Pompano Beach, a thirty minute drive for the sizeable Cuban community in Miami.</P>

<P>&#9;But -- Miami was an independent team whose players were supplied directly by the Commish's office. Uh, oh. That's right, Fay Vincent would not approve Minnie's contract, not even for one night; not even in Class A! "As a fan, I'm outraged," said Veeck. "This was simply a fun thing. We've gotten to the point where we take ourselves too seriously." But this was <I>baseball</I>, Ray, and whatever the Commish wanted, the Commish got. Minnie had to settle for BP and coaching duty.</P>

<P>&#9;Gordon Edes, writing in <I>The National</I> (remember <I>that?</I>), celebrated the integrity of the game being saved (again) by Vincent. We were spared the sight of Minnie acting out his "cockeyed notion."  Mike Veeck was a "smart-aleck son." But Edes was writing with tongue firmly in cheek. "Baseball spared all of us, probably forever, of the possibility that Minnie Minoso ... might tee off on some hard-throwing kid on a minor league diamond. Edes interviewed a number of disappointed Miracle fans. And he quoted Minnie: "What can you do? Nothing. What did I ever do wrong? I got old, that's what I did."</P>

<P>&#9;Chicago's <I>Tribune</I> quoted Mike Veeck, "These are the same guys who said the midget was an idiotic idea. They leave their sense of humor at the door when they get to work. This isn't the game my daddy passed to me." Bill Veeck, Mike's daddy, had just been elected to the Hall of Fame. Maybe Fay Vincent missed that.</P>

<P>&#9;Story over?  No way. This is baseball, and like Minnie Minoso, it just keeps rolling along. Fast forward to September 1991. Minnie is still alive and well and kneeling on deck. But Fay Vincent is gone, forced to resign on Labor Day. Bad news for the game, because now there is no one who can prevent the owners from trying to quash the union. There is no Commish now, only Bud Selig.</P>
<P>&#9;On the bright side -- Bud Selig gives his OK!  Minnie can take that symbolic swing in the 90s. White Sox manager Gene Lamont says OK, and adds, "I hope I'm managing in the year 2000 when he plays in his seventh decade." But this time, the ChiSox were in a pennant race even closer than the year before. Oh, they would run out of gas again, and finish eight back. But at the key moment, there was grumbling in the clubhouse, which got up to the Sox GM Ron Schueler; when it got to Minnie, he graciously bowed out. </P>

<P>&#9;There is a bright note in Minnie's plight. Thanks to Mike Veeck, also president of the St Paul Saints, Minnie got an at bat. It happened June 30, 1993, before 3,941 fans in St Paul. The newly formed Northern League was out of the control of the Commish's office, and while his AB was not official, it did take place in a professional league.</P>

<P>&#9;Minnie faced off with Yoshi Seo of the Thunder Bay Whiskey Jacks -- at 19, Seo was the youngest player in the league, and at least fifty years younger than the batter he faced. Minnie took two, then hit -- a comebacker. But Minnie hustled to first, before trotting off to a standing ovation. The article in <I>Sports Collectors Digest</I> (8/13/93) says Veeck sent Minnie's contract to the Cooperstown Hall of Fame, but I haven't seen it on display there -- yet. Maybe after he's inducted in Sacramento?</P>

<P>&#9;"If he doesn't jump, I get a base hit," said Minnie in the locker room (<I>Baseball Weekly</I>, 7/2/93.) Could he play in the bigs? "Not 160 games, but I can swing a bat ... and I can run to first base. Nothing is impossible when you take care of yourself. I'm very happy. I feel like I was in Comiskey Park again."</P>

<P>&#9;In September 1993, guess who was going to try again for one at bat with the White Sox?  Selig OK'd it again, but again the White Sox players "quashed" it (<I>Baseball Weekly</I>.) Tom Weir applauded the players for their annual defense of the integrity of the game. He added that Vincent was right to veto Minnie in 1990 -- "Of course, that was way back when baseball still cared enough about its integrity to have a real commissioner."</P>

<P>&#9;The Sox won the AL West by eight games in 1993. You would think that maybe the day after the champagne flowed, they'd have let Minnie hit. But by now, there was a tradition....</P>

<P>&#9;In baseball, like life, timing is everything. If Selig was in for Vincent a year sooner, Minnie would have batted in 1990. Had the White Sox been farther back in '91, or farther ahead in '93.... "Nothing is impossible when you take care of yourself."</P>

<B><U><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>IN MEMORIAM   </P>
</B></U>
<P>&#9;There was something irresistable about Ted Williams. I saw him play on TV a few times, in the late fifties and in 1960, his last season. He'd hit .388 in 1957, my first summer as a fan, but he was in that other league. I rememer him best for All Star game appearances.</P>

<P>&#9;And then for speaking his mind, uncensored. Calling for the Hall to open its doors, as MLB finally did, to the best of the Negro Leaguers. One of many post-playing days fine moments. Too many to list here.</P>

<P>&#9;When I had the task of poeming Ted for <I>Romancing the Horsehide</I>, over a decade ago, I did some research. And then I decided to write about the day for which I will best remember Ted Williams. Here is that poem.</P>

<B><P>THE KID</P>
</B>
<P>Final day of the season:</P>
<P>The choice is to sit it out</P>
<P>And go down in history with the handful</P>
<P>Of .400 hitters --</P>
<P>Or play the doubleheader.</P>

<P>The numbers that spell Ted best</P>
<P>May be that six-for-eight,</P>
<P>Knocked out while on the ledge,</P>
<P>Baseball immortality on the line,</P>
<P>Crux of a legend.</P>
<P>Williams accepted the dare.</P>

<P>Too much for a single nickname:</P>
<P>Splinter for opposing arms,</P>
<P>Splendid for the Fenway swarms ...</P>
<P>Seemed a veteran of foreign war</P>
<P>Even before Korea.</P>
<P>Triple-Crown Thumper</P>
<P>Who had to have the </P>
<P>Last turn at bat</P>
<P>In Teddy's Ballgame.</P></DIR>
