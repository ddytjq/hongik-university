<h2>
Lesson: Security Features Overview
</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>JDK 1.2 contains substantial security features enhancements:
policy-based, easily-configurable, fine-grained access control; 
new cryptographic services and certificate and key management 
classes and interfaces; and three new tools.
These topics are discussed in the following sections:

<ul>

   <li><a href = "#AccessControl">Security Architecture Extensions</a>
<p>

<li><a href = "#CryptographyAPI">Cryptography Architecture Extensions</a>
<p>

<li><a href = "#Tools">Security-Related Tools.</a><p>

</ul>

<br>


<H2><a name="SecurityAPI">Security Architecture Extensions</a></H2>

<blockquote>

<p>Access control has evolved to be far more fine-grained than in previous
versions of the Java platform.

<p>The original security model provided by the Java platform, known
as the "sandbox" model, existed in order to provide a very restricted 
environment in which to run untrusted code obtained from the open network.  
In the sandbox model, shown in the following diagram, 
local code is trusted to have full 
access to vital system resources, such as the file system, but downloaded 
remote code (an applet) is not trusted and can access only the limited resources 
provided inside the sandbox. A security manager is responsible in this and
subsequent platforms for determining which resource accesses are allowed.

<p>
    <b>JDK 1.0 Security Model:</b>

<p><center><IMG SRC="../../figures/security1.2/scrtymdl.gif" WIDTH="435" HEIGHT="311" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT=""></center></p>
<br>

<p>JDK 1.1 introduced the concept of a "signed applet," as illustrated 
in the next figure.  
A digitally signed applet is treated like
local code, with full access to resources, if the public key used to
verify the signature is trusted.  Unsigned applets are still
run in the sandbox.  Signed applets are delivered, with their
respective signatures, in signed JAR (Java ARchive) files.
<p>
    <b>JDK 1.1 Security Model:</b>

<p><center><IMG SRC="../../figures/security1.2/scrtmdl2.gif" WIDTH="432" HEIGHT="332" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT=""></center></p>
<br>

<p>JDK 1.2 introduces a number of improvements over JDK 1.1.
First, all code, regardless of whether it is local or remote,
can now be subject to a security <b>policy</b>.  
The security policy defines
the set of <b>permissions</b> available for code from
various signers or locations
and can be configured by a user or a system administrator.
Each permission specifies a
permitted access to a particular resource,
such as read and
write access to a specified file or directory or connect access
to a given host and port..

<p>The runtime system organizes code into individual <b>domains</b>, 
each of which encloses a set of classes whose instances are granted the same set 
of permissions. A domain can be configured to be
equivalent to the sandbox, so applets can still be run in a
restricted environment if the user or the administrator so chooses.
Applications run unrestricted, as before, by default but can
optionally be subject to a security policy.

<p>The new security architecture in JDK 1.2 is illustrated in the following figure.
The arrow on the left end refers to a domain whose code is granted full
access to resources; the arrow on the right refers to the opposite extreme:
a domain restricted exactly the same as the original sandbox. The domains
in between have more accesses allowed than the sandbox but less than
full access.

<hr></blockquote>

<p>The first release of the JDK Security API in JDK 1.1 introduced the
<b>Java cryptography architecture (JCA)</b>, which refers to a framework for
accessing and developing cryptographic functionality for the Java platform.
The JCA includes a 
provider architecture 
that allows for multiple and interoperable cryptography implementations.
The term <b>cryptographic service provider (CSP)</b>, or simply provider,
refers to a package (or a set of packages) that supplies
a concrete implementation of a subset of the cryptography aspects of
the JDK Security API.  

<p>In JDK 1.1 a provider could,
for example, contain an implementation of one or more 
<a href = "../summary/glossary.html#DigitalSignature">digital signature</a> 
algorithms, 
<a href = "../summary/glossary.html#MessageDigest ">message digest</a>
algorithms, and key-generation
algorithms. JDK 1.2 adds five more types of services:

<ul>
<li>Keystore creation and management<p>
<li>Algorithm parameter management<p>
<li>Algorithm parameter generation<p>
<li>Key factory support to convert between different key representations<p>
<li>Certificate factory support to generate certificates and
certificate revocation lists (CRLs) from their encodings
</ul>

JDK 1.2 also enables a provider to
supply a random-number generation (RNG) algorithm. 

<p>Sun's version of the Java Runtime Environment comes
standard with a default provider, named 
SUN. The SUN provider package includes implementations of
a number of DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) services,
implementations of the MD5  (RFC 1321) and SHA-1 (NIST FIPS 180-1)
message digest algorithms, a certificate factory for X.509 
certificates and certificate revocation lists, a pseudo-random-number 
generation algorithm, and a keystore implementation.

<p>The <i>Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)</i> extends the JDK 
to include APIs for 
<a href = "../summary/glossary.html#Encryption">encryption</a>, 
key exchange, and message
authentication code (MAC).  Together the JCE and the 
cryptography aspects of the JDK 
provide a complete, platform-independent cryptography API.
The JCE is released separately as an extension to the JDK, in
accordance with U.S. export control regulations,
and is not covered in this trail.

<p>The following figure illustrates the various JCA modules. 
The SPI (service provider interface) layer, representing methods
that must be implemented by cryptographic service providers,
is described in the following section.

<H3>Cryptographic Services </H3>

<blockquote>

A number of new "engine" classes 
have been added in JDK 1.2 to the 
<code>Signature</code>, <code>MessageDigest</code>, and 
<code>KeyPairGenerator</code> classes available in JDK 1.1.
An engine class defines a cryptographic service
in an abstract fashion (without a concrete implementation).
An engine class defines API
methods that allow applications to access the specific type
of cryptographic service it provides, such as a
digital signature algorithm. The actual implementations,
from one or more providers, are those for specific
algorithms. 

<p>
The application interfaces supplied by an engine class are
implemented in terms of a <i>service provider interface (SPI)</i>.
That is, each engine class has a corresponding
abstract SPI class that defines the service provider 
interface methods that cryptographic 
service providers must implement.

<p>For example, an API client may request and use an instance of 
the <code>Signature</code> engine class to 
access the functionality of a digital signature algorithm
to digitally sign a file.
The actual implementation supplied
in a <code>SignatureSpi</code> subclass would be that 
for a specific kind of signature
algorithm, such as SHA-1 with DSA or MD5 with RSA.

<p>Each instance of an engine class encapsulates an instance of the
corresponding SPI class as implemented by a cryptographic 
service provider. Each API method of an
engine class invokes the corresponding SPI method of the encapsulated
SPI object.

<H3><a name="Certificates">Certificate Interfaces and Classes</a></H3>

 <blockquote>

JDK 1.2 introduces certificate interfaces and classes for parsing and 
managing certificates and 
provides an X.509 v3 implementation of the certificate interfaces.
A certificate is basically a digitally signed statement from
one entity (person, company, etc.), saying that the public key of 
another entity has some particular value.

<p>Some of the certificate-related classes (all in the <code>java.security.cert</code>
package) are as follows.

<ul>

<li><b><code>Certificate</code></b> -
This class is an abstraction for certificates that have various formats but important 
common uses. For example, various types of certificates, such as X.509 and PGP, 
share general certificate functionality, such as encoding and
verifying, and some types of information, such as a public key. 
X.509, PGP, and SDSI certificates can all be implemented by subclassing the 
<code>Certificate</code>
class, even though they contain different sets of information and 
store and retrieve the information in different ways.<p>

<li><b><code>CertificateFactory</code></b> -
This class defines the functionality of a certificate factory, which is used to generate 
certificate and certificate revocation list (CRL) objects from their encodings.<p>

<li><b><code>X509Certificate</code></b> - This abstract class for X.509 certificates
 provides a standard way to access all the attributes of an X.509
certificate. 

</ul>

</blockquote>


<H3><a name="KeyMgmt">Key Management Classes and Interfaces</a></H3>

 <blockquote>

JDK 1.1 introduced abstract <code>Key</code> interfaces. JDK 1.2 adds 

<ul>

<li>A <b><code>KeyStore</code> class</b> (an engine class) 
that supplies well-defined interfaces to access and modify the information
in a keystore, which is a repository of keys and certificates.
Multiple different concrete implementations are possible, where each 
implementation is that for a particular <i>type</i> of keystore.
A keystore type defines the storage and data format of the keystore 
information.<p>

<li>A <b>default <code>KeyStore</code></b> implementation, which implements the 
keystore as a file, using a proprietary keystore type (format) named JKS. 
The keystore implementation protects each private key with its individual 
password and also protects 
the integrity of the entire keystore with a
(possibly different) password.<p>

<li><b>Key specification interfaces</b>, which are used 
for "transparent" representations 
of the key material that constitutes a key. The key material for a key may,
for example, consist of the key itself and the algorithm
parameters used to calculate the key value.
A <i>transparent</i> representation 
of keys means that you can access each key material value individually.<p>

<li>A tool (<b>keytool</b>)  for managing keys and certificates.

</ul>

</blockquote>

</blockquote>



<H2><a name="Tools">Security-Related Tools</H2>

<blockquote>

JDK 1.2 introduces three new tools: 

<ul>

<li>The <code>keytool</code> is used to create pairs of public and private keys,
to import
and display certificate chains, to export certificates, and to
generate X.509 v1 self-signed certificates and certificate requests
that can be sent to a certification authority.<p>

<li>The <code>jarsigner</code> tool signs JAR (Java 
ARchive format) files and verifies the authenticity of the
signature(s) of signed JAR files.<p>
 
<li>The <code>Policy Tool</code> creates and modifies the policy configuration 
files that define your installation's security policy.

</ul>
