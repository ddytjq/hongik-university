<center><u>About the Map</u></center>
<p>Our galaxy is just one of thousands that lie within 100 million light years.
The above map shows how galaxies tend to cluster into groups, the largest
nearby cluster is the Virgo cluster a concentration of several hundred galaxies
which dominates the galaxy groups around it.  Collectively all of these groups
of galaxies are known as the Virgo Supercluster.  The second richest cluster
in this volume of space is the Fornax Cluster, but it is not nearly as rich
as the Virgo cluster.  Only bright galaxies are depicted on the map, our galaxy
is the dot in the very centre.</p>

<center><b>Information on some Nearby Galaxy Groups</b></center>
<dl>
<dt><font color="#ccccff">Sculptor Group</font></dt>
<dd>The Sculptor group is the nearest group of galaxies to the Local Group and
is dominated by five galaxies, four spiral - NGC 247, 253, 300 and 7793 and one
irregular - NGC 55.  The nearest of these is NGC 55 which lies on the border of 
the Sculptor group and our Local group.
</dd>
<dt><font color="#ccccff">Maffei Group</font></dt>
<dd>In 1968, the Italian astronomer Paolo Maffei discovered two galaxies hidden 
behind the plane of our galaxy and thus heavily obscured by interstellar matter. 
These two galaxies are known as Maffei 1 and Maffei 2.  Together with the galaxy 
IC342, and the extremely obscured galaxy Dwingeloo 1 they make up the dominant 
members of another nearby group.  Maffei 1 is the nearest large elliptical galaxy 
to us. Although observation of the group is difficult, there are now 16 member 
galaxies known, most of which are dwarfs.
</dd>
<dt><font color="#ccccff">M81 Group</font></dt>
<dd>This is a prominent nearby group in Ursa Major and is centred around the famous 
M81/M82 pair of galaxies together with the fairly bright NGC 2403 galaxy. M82 is 
a famous 'starburst' galaxy, the galaxy has had a close encounter with its larger 
neighbour M81 in the past few million years, and the near-miss has generated a 
large wave of star formation within the galaxy.
</dd>
<dt><font color="#ccccff">Canes I Group</font></dt>
<dd>Another nearby group centred around NGC 4214, 4244 and 4395.  The spiral galaxy
M94 also probably lies at the back of this group.  This group is notable for 
containing a large number of medium-sized dwarf galaxies. 
</dd>
<dt><font color="#ccccff">NGC 5128 Group</font></dt>
<dd>This is a neighbouring group of galaxies in Centaurus and is dominated by the 
two spiral galaxies M83 and NGC 4945 and the large lenticular galaxy NGC 5128. 
NGC 5128 is one of the brightest nearby galaxies and it is a powerful source of 
radio waves (the galaxy is called "Centaurus A" by radio astronomers).  The galaxy 
also seems to have merged with a large spiral galaxy within the past 100 million years. 
</dd>
<dt><font color="#ccccff">M101 Group</font></dt>
<dd>This group is centred around the famous M101 galaxy which is the nearest giant 
spiral galaxy - it has a diameter of 200 thousand light years.  Near this group 
lies the large M51 (NGC 5194) group, and these two groups are often included 
together in lists as one large group.
</dd>
<dt><font color="#ccccff">Leo I Group</font></dt>
<dd>This is a large and prominant group of spiral galaxies in Leo consisting of two 
main subgroups, one centred around M65, M66 and NGC 3628, and the other centred 
around M95, M96, M105 and NGC 3384.
</dd>
<dt><font color="#ccccff">Canes II Group</font></dt>
<dd>Another large collection of spiral galaxies in Canes Venatici, the dominant 
members are probably M106, NGC 4096 and NGC 4490, but there are many other galaxy 
groups in this area of the sky and this whole region is known as the Canes Cloud.
</dd>
<dt><font color="#ccccff">Virgo Cluster</font></dt>
<dd>This is the most famous cluster of galaxies. It is much larger than any other 
group within 100 million light years.  There are about 150 large galaxies in 
this cluster and at least a thousand known dwarf galaxies.  This cluster 
completely dominates our tiny corner of the Universe, and even our Local Group 
of galaxies is being gravitationally pulled by this cluster. At the core of the 
Virgo cluster lies the three large elliptical galaxies M84, M86 and M87.  
These galaxies probably formed from the merger of many smaller galaxies and are 
much more massive than our own galaxy.
</dd>
<dt><font color="#ccccff">Ursa Major Groups</font></dt>
<dd>This is a large spur of spiral galaxies on one side of the Virgo cluster 
stretching across 20 million light years of space.  There are probably two main 
groups here - Ursa Major North (around NGC 3631, 3953, and M109) and Ursa Major 
South (around NGC 3726, 3938 and 4051).
</dd>
<dt><font color="#ccccff">Fornax Cluster</font></dt>
<dd>The second richest cluster within 100 million light years is the Fornax
cluster although it is much smaller than the Virgo cluster.  The are actually 
two neighbouring clusters here called the Fornax I cluster and the Fornax II or 
Eridanus group.  These two clusters contain 30 to 40 large galaxies each. The 
groups of galaxies around the Fornax cluster are sometimes called the Fornax 
supercluster or Southern supercluster.
</dd>
<dt><font color="#ccccff">Leo II Groups</font></dt>
<dd>The Leo II Groups are a large collection of galaxy groups clustered about 30
million light years to one side of the Virgo cluster.
</dd>
<dt><font color="#ccccff">Virgo III Groups</font></dt>
<dd>These galaxy groups stretching away from the Virgo cluster are called the 
Virgo III cloud.  (Virgo I is the Virgo cluster itself, and Virgo II is some 
groups of galaxies south of Virgo cluster around M61).  The gravitational pull
of the Virgo cluster is probably why this collection of groups has been stretched
into a long filament.

<p>Below is a map of the Virgo cluster - the nearest large cluster of galaxies.
The map shows the positions of 187 of the brightest galaxies in and around this
cluster.  At the centre of the cluster are several massive elliptical and
lenticular (lens-shaped) galaxies.  It is impossible to get a good photograph
of the entire cluster because the galaxies are faint objects scattered across
15 degrees of the sky, and a large angle photograph would be swamped by thousands
of foreground stars in our own galaxy.  The brightest galaxies are labeled.</p>
