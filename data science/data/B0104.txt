        HOW DO I ARRANGE A MORTGAGE</b></font><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">?</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The first question we are normally
        asked is &quot;Can I get a mortgage?&quot; The answer to this is likely
        to be yes as long as you are aged 18 or over, have a regular income and
        are able to show that you can meet the monthly payments.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We will need to obtain good
        references and a satisfactory valuation of the property you wish to mortgage.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>HOW MUCH CAN I BORROW?</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">This depends on:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&#9;what you earn and
            spend</font></div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&#9;the property</font></div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&#9;the product you choose</font></div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We will be pleased to calculate
        how much you can borrow. This will depend on your annual income and what
        you spend.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">If you want to apply for a mortgage
        with a partner we will usually take into account all the income of the
        person who gets paid the most and part of the income of the other person.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial," size="2">Once we have talked to you
        about a mortgage, we can if you wish, give you a Cumberland Mortgage Guarantee
        Certificate showing how much we will lend you if the valuation of the
        property is satisfactory.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">On a typical private house within
        our branch operating area, we will normally lend up to 95% (and in some
        cases 100%) of the purchase price or the valuation, whichever is the lower.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">If you would like to transfer
        an existing mortgage with another lender to the Cumberland we will normally
        lend up to 90% of the current valuation of your home.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The maximum we will lend to
        new customers outside our branch operating area is normally 75% of the
        purchase price or the valuation whichever is the lower. There may be special
        products, available from time to time, where we would be prepared to lend
        more than 75%.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We may also be able to arrange
        a loan on the security of your property if you do not currently have a
        mortgage on it. Please <a href="./onyx/form4.htm">contact us</a> for details.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">If we lend more than 75% of
        the purchase price or valuation of the property (whichever is the lower),
        your loan will be a high loan to value advance. You will normally be charged
        a fee for it called a high percentage loan fee if you borrow more than
        90% of the purchase price or valuation of the property. (If you borrow
        between 75% and 90% the Society will pay the high percentage loan fee
        for you). The Society may use all or part of this fee to reimburse itself
        for the amount it has paid for insurance or place it in an additional
        security fund to help towards meeting future claims. The additional security
        which is provided by the Society or by an insurance company does <u><b>not</b></u>
        provide cover for you. More information on this is given in our leaflet
        “Cumberland High Loan to Value Advances” which will be given to you at
        the time you make your mortgage application. If you do not receive this
        leaflet please ask for one.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>WHAT WILL IT COST ME?</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Initial Costs</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">When you are deciding how much
        you want to borrow, you must remember that in addition to the deposit
        you will have other expenses such as solicitors fees (including registration
        fees and possibly stamp duty), valuation fees (unless the mortgage product
        you have chosen includes a free valuation) and insurance costs. We will
        go through these with you so that you can work out how much you need to
        borrow.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">You will be given a written
        quotation containing details of the repayments that you will be expected
        to make at the time of your mortgage enquiry. If you are taking a discounted,
        capped or fixed rate mortgage product the quotation will also provide
        details of what your future potential repayments may be at the end of
        the discounted, capped or fixed rate period.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The costs that you will be expected
        to pay in connection with your mortgage will be set out in the quotation
        that will be given to you at the time of your mortgage enquiry. Details
        of any early repayment charges that may be charged are given on this website
        and are contained in our leaflets "Mortgages A Guide to Special Offers"and
        "A Guide to Fixed/Capped Rate Mortgage Products at the Cumberland". Details
        are also shown in the quotation and the mortgage product fact sheet which
        will be sent to you with your Offer of Loan.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Monthly Mortgage Payment</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The amount of the monthly mortgage
        payment depends on:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">&#9;how much you wish
            to borrow</font></div>

            your mortgage payment</font></div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Take all these points into account
        and with the help of a written quotation you should have a good idea of
        how much your mortgage will cost each month.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Charges</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Details of all our mortgage
        charges are contained on this website. When you make your mortgage application
        we will give you a leaflet called &quot;Policy and Practice and Charges
        for Mortgage Linked Services&quot; which contains the charges that we
        may make in connection with your mortgage. We will send you a copy of
        this leaflet once each year if there have been any changes to our charges.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>WHAT TYPES OF MORTGAGE ARE
        AVAILABLE?</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">There are two ways of repaying
        your loan - repayment and interest only.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We will give you details of
        the different repayment methods and repayment periods that are available.
        If you choose to pay only interest on your loan then we will give you
        a general description of the ways in which you can repay the capital.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">You may also like to visit the
        Financial Services Authority website <a href="http://www.fsa.gov.uk/" target="_blank">www.fsa.gov.uk</a>
        and look at their publications &quot;<a href="http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pubs/public/pl16.pdf" target="_blank">A
        Guide To Repaying Your Mortgage</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pubs/public/pl18.pdf" target="_blank">Is
        An Endowment Mortgage Right for You</a>&quot;.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Repayment Mortgage</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">This type of mortgage involves
        repayment of the loan gradually over an agreed period. Each monthly payment
        you make consists of two parts, interest on the loan and repayment of
        part of the loan. Most of your monthly payment in the first few years
        simply covers the interest with only a small amount going towards repayment
        of the loan, the repayment part of your monthly payment will however increase
        as the mortgage term and the amount of the loan reduces. Provided you
        keep up your monthly payments the loan will be repaid at the end of the
        agreed mortgage period. With this type of mortgage it is recommended that
        you take out life assurance sufficient to repay the loan if you should
        die before the end of the mortgage term. The amount of interest you pay
        will normally vary with changes in our base variable mortgage rate.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Interest Only Mortgage</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">With an interest only mortgage
        you make a monthly payment to us to cover the interest on the loan. The
        loan amount will remain the same and the interest is payable on the total
        amount of the loan for the whole of the mortgage period. The amount of
        interest you pay will normally vary with changes in our base variable
        mortgage rate.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">To repay an interest only mortgage
        you will usually need to ensure you have a suitable investment plan which
        will pay the mortgage off at the end of the agreed term. This will involve
        the payment of a monthly premium to an insurance company. The premium
        is calculated to try to ensure that the money from the investment plan
        is sufficient to repay the mortgage within the agreed term. <B>There is
        however no guarantee that the amount you receive will pay the mortgage
        off in full.</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We will tell you what will happen
        if you do not make suitable arrangements to repay the capital and that
        it is your responsibility to ensure that an adequate repayment method
        is in place.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We will also advise you that
        it is your responsibility to ensure any investment plan premiums are paid
        direct to the company concerned.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">If you want to use an existing
        investment plan, such as an endowment policy or policies you will have
        to ensure that it or they are adequate for the loan.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">It is important to remember
        that if you give up an investment plan such as an endowment policy before
        it ends you may not get back the full amount that you paid into the policy.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The lump sum from these types
        of policies depends on the investment returns that are achieved with your
        money. You should bear in mind that it is this lump sum that will be used
        to repay your mortgage. <B>It is important that you regularly check the value
        of your investment to ensure that it is growing at a sufficient rate to
        enable you to repay your mortgage at the end of its term.</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We will remind you each year
        of the need to ensure that you have an adequate repayment method in place.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Please remember that with most
        investment plans, the value of an investment can fall as well as rise
        and therefore future values cannot be guaranteed.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We will give you details of
        the different types of interest rates that are available (for example
        variable, capped, fixed or discounted rates). Further details of the different
        types of interest rates available can be found on this website and in our leaflets "Mortgages
        A Guide to Special Offers" and "A Guide to Fixed/Capped Rate Mortgage
        Products at the Cumberland".</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The interest rate that will
        apply to your account at the beginning of the loan will be shown in your
        Offer of Loan. If the interest rate changes between the time that you
        receive your Offer of Loan and the time when your mortgage is completed
        we will tell you.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We calculate interest on the
        ‘daily interest’ basis and charge the interest to your account each month.
        Each time you make a payment we adjust the interest you will be charged
        to allow for the payment you have made. If you borrow extra, interest
        will be charged from the day the extra loan starts. Any items such as
        charges, fees, mortgage interest and insurance premiums, which are not
        paid by the last day of the month in which they are due, will result in
        additional interest being charged until the payment is made to your account.
        If at anytime you wish to make a lump sum payment of £500 or more off
        your mortgage, and you would like us to calculate a reduced monthly payment,
        please ask us to arrange this at the time you make the payment. <b>It
        is however important to note there may be an early repayment charge if
        you have benefited from a discount, cashback or other incentive.</b> Please
        ask for details before repaying a lump sum.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">On variable rate loans we may
        change the interest rate that we charge you from time to time. The interest
        rate may go up or down. When we increase the interest rate we will always
        give you advance notice of the new interest rate and the date it becomes
        effective. The notice will be given by either writing to you individually
        or by placing an advertisement in a national newspaper.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">If during the term of your loan
        you decide to make an additional lump sum repayment of £500 or more over
        and above your normal monthly repayment you may do so. If you would like
        us to calculate a reduced monthly payment, you must tell us when making
        the repayment. The capital repayment will be subject to an early repayment
        charge if your mortgage is still within its original early repayment charge
        period or if you are benefiting from our existing borrowers discount.
        Provided that the additional capital repayment is received on or before
        the 15th of the month a reduced monthly payment will be due from the end
        of the month. If the capital repayment is not received until after the
        15th of the month a reduced monthly payment will not be due until the
        end of the following month.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>OVER WHAT PERIOD CAN I HAVE
        MY MORTGAGE?</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Typical repayment periods range
        from ten to twenty five years. Other repayment periods may be considered.
        If the term of your loan is likely to extend beyond your retirement date
        it is important you ensure that you will be able to continue to meet your
        regular monthly repayments after you retire.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>WHAT KIND OF PROPERTY CAN
        I LOOK FOR?</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We will lend on most types of
        property, as long as our valuer agrees it is good security for the money
        we are lending you.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">So, we're normally happy to
        arrange mortgages on:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">detached, semi-detached
            and terraced houses or bungalows, whether they are new or old.</font></div>

        <li>
          <div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"> purpose built leasehold
            maisonettes and flats (we will not normally lend on freehold flats
            except in Scotland).</font></div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">properties which are partly
            used for business, for example, guest houses or shops with living
            accommodation above. (We usually charge a higher rate of interest
            on this type of mortgage).</font></div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">some properties which

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">If you want a mortgage on a
        newly-built property or a property you are having built, it must have
        a National House Building Council Buildmark Guarantee or similar. Alternatively
        the building work must be fully supervised by a qualified architect or
        surveyor acting on your behalf. For full details of our requirements please
        contact any <a href="branchlocator.htm">Cumberland branch</a> as soon
        as possible</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Sometimes with new houses the
        builder may ask to be paid in stages. If he does, we can give you the
        loan in instalments as the work goes on, depending on satisfactory inspections
        by our valuer.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">So as you can see, we are quite
        flexible about the kind of property we'll lend money on.</font></p>

        application form.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Once the mortgage application
        form has been completed, we will make arrangements to send a professional
        valuer to prepare a mortgage valuation report on the property to make
        sure we can lend what you want.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We will also have to check your
        income.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">If you have not already done
        so, you will need to instruct a solicitor to handle the legal details
        (procedures for buying property in Scotland are different from the system
        in England and Wales so it is important to contact a solicitor at an early
        stage for guidance). We will be happy to recommend a solicitor for you
        if you don't already have one.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">While you're doing this, we
        check your application and obtain references and a valuation report. If
        these are satisfactory, we will give you the mortgage. This usually takes
        two to three weeks, but we can normally give an immediate "in principle"
        decision.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">We'll then send you written
        confirmation of the mortgage we can give you. This is called the "Offer
        of Loan". We will also send a copy of the Offer of Loan and our instructions
        to your solicitor.</font></p>
