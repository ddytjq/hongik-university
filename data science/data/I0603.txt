    <p align="left">Online supporters of Leeds United are outraged that the clubs official
    site is to start charging for live Internet coverage of its football matches and the bulk
    of its Internet news service. The club's official site is home to the live coverage (using
    Real Audio) of away matches and also is host to numerous statements from players, staff
    and members of the Leeds board. </p>
    <p>Since the 1st of October the club has decided to charge 5.99 per month for its Real
    Audio services. This move came exactly at the same time as the departure of Manager george
    Graham. Fans hungry for news of Graham's &quot;will he wont he?&quot; departure were
    astounded to find that a previously free and comprehensive Real Audio news service from
    the club was now only available to paying subscribers and what free news was available was
    seriously curtailed.</p>
    <p>A similar sitiation now exists as fans await an announcement of the&nbsp; appointment
    of a new manager. Fans have been writing to the club to complain, they have taken up the
    issue with club sponsors, Packard Bell, with Shirt manufacturers Puma as well as in the
    national media. Staff at Puma have agreed to pass on complaints they have recieved to the
    club. </p>
    <p>&quot;It's funny that Leeds United is charging to pass on information to the very
    lifeblood of the club - the fans. Most real audio users are those who are based away from
    their Yorkshire homeland desperate for news about their club. This is the thin edge of the
    wedge with the advent of Pay Per View its fast becoming very clear that clubs want to make
    the fan pay - for everything! Other clubs with web pages supplied by Planet will no doubt
    follow suit,&quot; says Scottish fan, John Boocock. Planet have built web sites for over
    16 top clubs.</p>
    <p>The club has so far failed to respond to any of the fans complaints.</font></td>
