The publication of the Losey paper on monarch butterflies prompted the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada to carry out field studies using Bt 176.  In addition to determining the dose-toxicity relationship for Bt 176 corn pollen and monarch larvae, the study also focused on the extent and pattern of corn pollen dispersion at varying distances from the corn field.

			<p>"The Use of Transgenic Insect-resistant Crops in Switzerland"
A study of the Swiss Federal Research Institute for Agroecology and Agriculture, under mandate from the Swiss Agency for Environment, Forests and Landscape (SAEFL)
The authors, Ellen Hütter, Franz Bigler and Padruot M. Fried, describe the consequences of Bt crops for the environment and agriculture.  One chapter of this report addresses the potential impacts of insect-resistant transgenic crops on nontarget organisms.  This study is not yet publicly available.

			<p>After a four-year laboratory study on the effects of transgenic maize and oilseed rape on bees, Stefan Wölfl and Hans-Hinrich Kaatz from the University of Jena and the Hans-Knöll Institue in Jena (Germany) concluded that there were "no adverse effects on the bees even under extreme conditions."  However, they also found out that the intestinal microorganisms in the bees had taken up plant genetic material.  It is uncertain how long the integrated DNA remains in the microbial genome or whether it is active at all.  The authors caution that "there is no reason for any anxiety about human and animal health."</p>

			<p>The Novartis Bt-176 maize expresses the Bt toxin in the pollen, but it is not clear yet whether the nectar also contains the toxin.  Since the protein level in nectar is significantly lower than in pollen, and even if Bt toxin were present, the toxicity would be less than with pollen (Malone et al., 1998).</p>

Another Novartis study on honeybees arrives at the same conclusion of no impact.  Studies performed at Monsanto confirm these observations.  Sims (1995) also reports on the the effect of Bt on adult bees and larval development.

			<p>The health and quality of the soil is directly related to the number and diversity of the microorganisms present.  Soil fertility depends upon the myriad metabolic reactions and interactions among microorganisms, animals and plants.  At present, very little data exist on the impact of Bt toxins on soil microorganisms, as experiments are difficult to carry out.  It is hypothesized that the DNA from rotting plant parts, remaining in the field after harvest, would be available for uptake from soil microorganisms.  The probability for horizontal gene transfer is likely very low (Schlüter, 1995; Amman et al., 1996), but experiments to measure this in open field conditions are difficult to perform (Prins et al., 1994, Broer et al., 1996, Nielsen et al., 1997).</p>

			<p>Scientists from the University of New York have reported that the Bt toxin can be detected in the root exudates of Bt maize.  The toxin protein binds quickly to clay and humic acid.  The bound state of the Bt toxin, which was observed to persist for up to 234 days, protects the protein from microbial degradation.In the bound state, the toxicity of the protein to insect larvae remains unchanged (Saxena et al., 1999).</p>

			<p>Laboratory studies by Munkvold G.P. et al., 1999 from the Iowa State University Extension Service, has demonstrated that the rates of  fusarium ear rot in Bt maize were lower than in conventionally bred corn.  Fumonisins are mycotoxins produced by various species of Fusarium fungi and have been shown to be carcinogenic to laboratory animals.  Insects tunnelling through the corn carry spores into damaged kernels or into the stalk.</p>

Science can help to inform the discussion, by providing information on the relative benefits and risks.  The criteria for acceptance of biotechnology applications must come from society, especially if ethical questions are raised.
