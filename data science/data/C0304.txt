        <p>Hill House Hammond is a national insurance intermediary with 230 branches 
          throughout England, Scotland and Wales. In addition to being one of 
          the largest personal lines intermediary in the UK, HHH also has a developing 
          commercial insurance division. HHH is a wholly owned subsidiary of <a href="http://www.norwich-union.co.uk" target="_top"><b>Norwich

          group. 
        <p>Bristol based, the company was founded in 1959 by Arthur Holmes, who

          branches included Havant, Nottingham, London, Leeds and, with the opening 
          of the Severn Bridge, Wales. 
        <p>In 1983, Hill House was bought by Hill Samuel through its Lowndes Lambert 
          subsidary which had previously sold personal lines insurance under the 
          L Hammond name. The decision was then taken to merge the names of Hill 
          House and Hammond to form Hill House Hammond. By 1991, HHH had a network 
          of 133 branches when it was purchased by <a href="http://www.norwich-union.co.uk" target="_top"><b>Norwich
