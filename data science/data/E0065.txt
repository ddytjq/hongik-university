<h2><a name="simple-program">
How do I write this very simple program?</a></h2>
Often, especially at the start of semesters, I get a lot of questions about
how to write very simple programs. Typically, the problem to be solved is
to read in a few numbers, do something with them, and write out an answer.
Here is a sample program that does that:
<pre>
	#include&lt;iostream>
	#include&lt;vector>
	#include&lt;algorithm>
	using namespace std;

	int main()
	{
		vector&lt;double> v;

		double d;
		while(cin>>d) v.push_back(d);	// read elements
		if (!cin.eof()) {		// check if input failed
			cerr << "format error\n";
			return 1;	// error return
		}

		cout << "read " << v.size() << " elements\n";

		reverse(v.begin(),v.end());
		cout << "elements in reverse order:\n";
		for (int i = 0; i&lt;v.size(); ++i) cout << v[i] << '\n';

		return 0; // success return
	}
</pre>
Here are a few observations about this program:
<ul>
<li> This is a Standard ISO C++ program using the standard library.
Standard library facilities are declared in namespace std in headers
without a .h suffix.
<li>
If you want to compile this on a Windows machine, you need to compile it as
a "console application".
Remember to give your source file the .cpp suffix or the compiler might think
that it is C (not C++) source.
<li>
Yes, <a href="#void-main">main() returns an int</a>.
<li>
Reading into a standard vector guarantees that you don't overflow some
arbitrary buffer.
Reading into an array without making a "silly error" is beyond the ability
of complete novices - by the time you get that right, you are no longer
a complete novice.
If you doubt this claim, I suggest you read my paper
"Learning Standard C++ as a New Language", which you can download from
<a href="papers.html">my publications list</a>.
<li>
The !cin.eof() is a test of the stream's format.
Specifically, it tests whether the loop ended by finding end-of-file
(if not, you didn't get input of the expected type/format).
For more information, look up "stream state" in your C++ textbook.
<li>
A vector knows its size, so I don't have to count elements.
<li>
This program contains no explicit memory management, and it does not
leak memory.
A vector keeps track of the memory it use to store its elements.
When a vector needs more memory for elements, is allocates more;
when a vector goes out of scope, it frees that memory.
Therefore, the user need not be concerned with the allocation and
deallocation of memory for vector elements.
<li>
for reading in strings, see
<a href="#read-string">How do I read a string from input?</a>.
<li>
The program ends reading input when it sees "end of file".
If you run the program from the keybord on a Unix machine "end of file"
is Ctrl-D.
If you are on a Windows machine that because of
<a href ="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q156/2/58.asp?LN=EN-US&SD=gn&FR=0&qry=End%20of%20File&rnk=11&src=DHCS_MSPSS_gn_SRCH&SPR=NTW40">a bug</a>
doesn't recognize an end-of-file character, you might prefer this slightly more
complicated version of the program that terminates input with the word "end":
<pre>
	#include&lt;iostream>
	#include&lt;vector>
	#include&lt;algorithm>
	#include&lt;string>
	using namespace std;

	int main()
	{
		vector&lt;double> v;

		double d;
		while(cin>>d) v.push_back(d);	// read elements
		if (!cin.eof()) {		// check if input failed
			cin.clear();		// clear error state
			string s;
			cin >> s;		// look for terminator string
			if (s != "end") {
				cerr << "format error\n";
				return 1;	// error return
			}
		}

		cout << "read " << v.size() << " elements\n";

		reverse(v.begin(),v.end());
		cout << "elements in reverse order:\n";
		for (int i = 0; i&lt;v.size(); ++i) cout << v[i] << '\n';

		return 0; // success return
	}
</pre>
</ul>

simply, see the "Tour of the Standard Library" Chapter of

<h2><a name="abstract-class">
Why do my compiles take so long?</a></h2>
You may have a problem with your compiler. It may be old, you may have it
installed wrongly, or your computer might be an antique.
I can't help you with such problems.
<p>
However, it is more likely that the program that you are trying to compile
is poorly designed, so that compiling it involves the compiler examining
hundreds of header files and tens of thousands of lines of code.
In principle, this can be avoided.
If this problem is in your library vendor's design, there isn't much you
can do (except changing to a better library/vendor), but you can structure
your own code to minimize re-compilation after changes.
Designs that do that are typically better, more maintainable, designs because
they exhibit better separation of concerns.
<p>
Consider a classical example of an object-oriented program:
<pre>
	class Shape {
	public:		// interface to users of Shapes
		virtual void draw() const;
		virtual void rotate(int degrees);
		// ...
	protected:	// common data (for implementers of Shapes)
		Point center;
		Color col;
		// ...
	};

	class Circle : public Shape {
	public:	
		void draw() const;
		void rotate(int) { }
		// ...
	protected:
		int radius;
		// ...
	};

	class Triangle : public Shape {
	public:	
		void draw() const;
		void rotate(int);
		// ...
	protected:
		Point a, b, c;
		// ...
	};	
</pre>
The idea is that users manipulate shapes through Shape's public interface,
and that implementers of derived classes (such as Circle and Triangle)
share aspects of the implementation represented by the protected members.
<p)
There are three serious problems with this apparently simple idea:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
It is not easy to define shared aspects of the implementation that are
helpful to all derived classes. For that reason, the set of protected members
is likely to need changes far more often than the public interface.
For example, even though "center" is arguably a valid concept for all Shapes,
it is a nuisance to have to maintain a point "center" for a Triangle - for
triangles, it makes more sense to calculate the center if and only if someone
expresses interest in it.
</li>
<li>
The protected members are likely to depend on "implementation" details that
the users of Shapes would rather not have to depend on. For example, many
(most?) code using a Shape will be logically independent of the definition
of "Color", yet the presence of Color in the definition of Shape will probably
require compilation of header files defining the operating system's notion of
color.
</li>
<li>
When something in the protected part changes, users of Shape have to
recompile -
even though only implementers of derived classes have access to the protected
members.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Thus, the presence of "information helpful to implementers" in the base class
that also acts as the interface to users is the source of instability in the
implementation, spurious recompilation of user code (when implementation
information changes), and excess inclusion of header files into user code
(because the "information helpful to implementers" needs those headers).
This is sometimes known as the "brittle base class problem."
<p>
The obvious solution is to omit the "information helpful to implemeters" for
classes that are used as interfaces to users. That is, to make interfaces,
pure interfaces. That is, to represent interfaces as abstract classes:
<pre>
	class Shape {
	public:		// interface to users of Shapes
		virtual void draw() const = 0;
		virtual void rotate(int degrees) = 0;
		virtual Point center() const = 0;
		// ...

		// no data
	};

	class Circle : public Shape {
	public:	
		void draw() const;
		void rotate(int) { }
		Point center() const { return center; }
		// ...
	protected:
		Point cent;
		Color col;
		int radius;
		// ...
	};

	class Triangle : public Shape {
	public:	
		void draw() const;
		void rotate(int);
		Point center() const;
		// ...
	protected:
		Color col;
		Point a, b, c;
		// ...
	};	
</pre>
The users are now insulated from changes to implementations of derived classes.
I have seen this technique decrease build times by orders of magnitudes.
<p>
But what if there really is some information that is common to all derived
classes (or simply to several derived classes)?
Simply make that information a class and derive the implementation classes
from that also:
<pre>
	class Shape {
	public:		// interface to users of Shapes
		virtual void draw() const = 0;
		virtual void rotate(int degrees) = 0;
		virtual Point center() const = 0;
		// ...

		// no data
	};

	struct Common {
		Color col;
		// ...
	};
		
	class Circle : public Shape, protected Common {
	public:	
		void draw() const;
		void rotate(int) { }
		Point center() const { return center; }
		// ...
	protected:
		Point cent;
		int radius;
	};

	class Triangle : public Shape, protected Common {
	public:	
		void draw() const;
		void rotate(int);
		Point center() const;
		// ...
	protected:
		Point a, b, c;
	};	
</pre>
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="sizeof-empty">
Why is the size of an empty class not zero?</a></h2>
To ensure that the addresses of two different objects will be different.
For the same reason, "new" always returns pointers to distinct objects.
Consider:
<pre>
	class Empty { };

	void f()
	{
		Empty a, b;
		if (&a == &b) cout << "impossible: report error to compiler supplier";

		Empty* p1 = new Empty;
		Empty* p2 = new Empty;
		if (p1 == p2) cout << "impossible: report error to compiler supplier";
	}	
</pre>
There is an interesting rule that says that an empty base class need
not be represented by a separate byte:
<pre>
	struct X : Empty {
		int a;
		// ...
	};

	void f(X* p)
	{
		void* p1 = p;
		void* p2 = &p->a;
		if (p1 == p2) cout << "nice: good optimizer";
	}
</pre>
This optimization is safe and can be most useful. It allows a programmer
to use empty classes to represent very simple concepts without overhead.
Some current compilers provide this "empty base class optimization".
<hr>
<h2><a name="data-in-class">
Why do I have to put the data in my class declarations?</a></h2>
You don't. If you don't want data in an interface, don't put it in the class
that defines the interface. Put it in derived classes instead.
See, <a href="#abstract-class">Why do my compiles take so long?</a>.
<p>
Sometimes, you do want to have representation data in a class.
Consider class complex:
<pre>
	template&lt;class Scalar> class complex {
	public:
		complex() : re(0), im(0) { }
		complex(Scalar r) : re(r), im(0) { }
		complex(Scalar r, Scalar i) : re(r), im(i) { }
		// ...

		complex& operator+=(const complex& a)
			{ re+=a.re; im+=a.im; return *this; }
		// ...
	private:
		Scalar re, im;
	};
</pre>
This type is designed to be used much as a built-in type and the representation
is needed in the declaration to make it possible to create genuinely local
objects (i.e. objects that are allocated on the stack and not on a heap) and
to ensure proper inlining of simple operations. Genuinely local objects and
inlining is necessary to get the performance of complex close to what is
provided in languages with a built-in complex type.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="virtual">
Why are member functions not virtual by default?</a></h2>
Because many classes are not designed to be used as base classes.
For example, see <a href="#data-in-class">class complex</a>.
<p>
Also, objects of a class with a virtual function require space needed by the 
virtual function call mechanism - typically one word per object. This overhead
can be significant, and can get in the way of layout compatibility with
data from other languages (e.g. C and Fortran).
<p>
See
<a href="dne.html"> The Design and Evolution of C++</a> for more
design rationale.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="virtual-dtor">
Why are destructors not virtual by default?</a></h2>
Because many classes are not designed to be used as base classes.
Virtual functions makes sense only in classes meant to act as interfaces to
objects of derived classes (typically allocated on a heap and accessed through
pointers or references).
<p>
So when should I declare a destructor virtual? Whenever the class has at
least one virtual function.
Having virtual functions indicate that a class is meant to act as an
interface to derived classes, and when it is, an object of a derived class
may be destroyed through a pointer to the base.
For example:
<pre>
	class Base {
		// ...
		virtual ~Base();
	};

	class Derived : public Base {
		// ...
		~Derived();
	};

	void f()
	{
		Base* p = new Derived;
		delete p;	// virtual destructor used to ensure that ~Derived is called
	}
</pre>
Had Base's destructor not been virtual, Derived's destructor would not have
been called - with likely bad effects, such as resources owned by Derived not
being freed.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="virtual-ctor">
Why don't we have virtual constructors?</a></h2>
A virtual call is a mechanism to get work done given partial information.
In particular, "virtual" allows us to call a function knowing only an
interfaces and not the exact type of the object.
To create an object you need complete information. In particular,
you need to know the exact type of what you want to create.
Consequently, a "call to a constructor" cannot be virtual.
<p>
Techniques for using an indirection when you ask to create an object are
often referred to as "Virtual constructors". For example, see TC++PL3 15.6.2.
<p>
For example, here is a technique for generating an object of an appropriate
type using an abstract class:
<pre>
	struct F {	// interface to object creation functions
		virtual A* make_an_A() const = 0;
		virtual B* make_a_B() const = 0;
	};

	void user(const F& fac)
	{
		A* p = fac.make_an_A();	// make an A of the appropriate type
		B* q = fac.make_a_B();	// make a B of the appropriate type
		// ...
	}

	struct FX : F {
		A* make_an_A() const { return new AX();	} // AX is derived from A
		B* make_a_B() const { return new BX();	} // BX is derived from B
	};

	struct FY : F {
		A* make_an_A() const { return new AY();	} // AY is derived from A
		B* make_a_B() const { return new BY();	} // BY is derived from B
	};

	int main()
	{
		user(FX());	// this user makes AXs and BXs
		user(FY());	// this user makes AYs and BYs
		// ...
	}
</pre>
This is a variant of what is often called "the factory pattern".
The point is that user() is completely isolated from knowledge of classes
such as AX and AY.
<hr>
<h2><a name="overloadderived">
Why doesn't overloading work for derived classes?</a></h2>
That question (in many variations) are usually prompted by an example
like this:
<pre>
	#include&lt;iostream>
	using namespace std;

	class B {
	public:
		int f(int i) { cout << "f(int): "; return i+1; }
		// ...
	};

	class D : public B {
	public:
		double f(double d) { cout << "f(double): "; return d+1.3; }
		// ...
	};

	int main()
	{
		D* pd = new D;

		cout << pd->f(2) << '\n';
		cout << pd->f(2.3) << '\n';
	}
</pre>
which will produce:
<pre>
	f(double): 3.3
	f(double): 3.6
</pre>
rather than the
<pre>
	f(int): 3
	f(double): 3.6
</pre>
that some people (wrongly) guessed.
<p>
In other words, there is no overload resolution between D and B. The compiler
looks into the scope of D, finds the single function "double f(double)" and
calls it. It never bothers with the (enclosing) scope of B. In C++, there is
no overloading across scopes - derived class scopes are not an exception to
this general rule. (See
<a href="dne.html">D&E</a> or
<a href="3rd.html">TC++PL3</a> for details).
<p>
But what if I want to create an overload set of all my f() functions from
my base and derived class? That's easily done using a using-declaration:
<pre>
	class D : public B {
	public:
		using B::f;	// make every f from B available
		double f(double d) { cout << "f(double): "; return d+1.3; }
		// ...
	};
</pre>
Give that modification, the output will be
<pre>
	f(int): 3
	f(double): 3.6
</pre>
That is, overload resolution was applied to B's f() and D's f() to select
the most appropriate f() to call.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="vcall">
Can I call a virtual function from a constructor?</a></h2>
Yes, but be careful. It may not do what you expect. In a constructor,
the virtual call mechanism is disabled because overriding from derived
classes hasn't yet happened. Objects are constructed from the base up,
"base before derived".
<p>
Consider:
<pre>
	#include&lt;string>
	#include&lt;iostream>
	using namespace std;

	class B {
	public:
		B(const string& ss) { cout << "B constructor\n"; f(ss); }
		virtual void f(const string&) { cout << "B::f\n";}
	};

	class D : public B {
	public:
		D(const string & ss) :B(ss) { cout << "D constructor\n";}
		void f(const string& ss) { cout << "D::f\n"; s = ss; }
	private:
		string s;
	};

	int main()
	{
		D d("Hello");
	}
</pre>
the program compiles and produce
<pre>
	B constructor
	B::f
	D constructor
</pre>
Note <i>not</i> D::f.
Consider what would happen if the rule were different so that D::f() was
called from B::B(): Because the constructor D::D() hadn't yet been run,
D::f() would try to assign its argument to an uninitialized string s.
The result would most likely be an immediate crash.
<p>
Destruction is done "derived class before base class", so virtual functions
behave as in constructors: Only the local definitions are used  - and no
calls are made to overriding functions to avoid touching the (now destroyed)
derived class part of the object.
<p>
For more details see
<a href="dne.html">D&E</a> 13.2.4.2 or <a href="3rd.html">TC++PL3</a> 15.4.3.
<p>
It has been suggested that this rule is an implementation artifact. It is
not so. In fact, it would be noticeably easier to implement the unsafe rule
of calling virtual functions from constructors exactly as from other functions.
However, that would imply that no virtual function could be written to rely
on invariants established by base classes. That would be a terrible mess.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="placement-delete">
Is there a "placement delete"?</a></h2>
No but if you need one you can write your own.
<p>
Consider placement new used to place objects in a set of arenas
<pre>
        class Arena {
        public:
                void* allocate(size_t);
                void deallocate(void*);
                // ...
        };

        void* operator new(size_t sz, Arena& a)
        {
                return a.allocate(sz);
        }

        Arena a1(some arguments);
        Arena a2(some arguments);
</pre>
Given that, we can write
<pre>
        X* p1 = new(a1) X;
        Y* p2 = new(a1) Y;
        Z* p3 = new(a2) Z;
        // ...
</pre>
But how can we later delete those objects correctly? The reason that there is
no built-in "placement delete" to match placement new is that there is no
general way of assuring that it would be used correctly. Nothing in the C++
type system allows us to deduce that p1 points to an object allocated in
Arena a1. A pointer to any X allocated anywhere can be assigned to p1.
<p>
However, sometimes the programmer does know, and there is a way:
<pre>
        template&lt;class T> void destroy(T* p, Arena& a)
        {
                if (p) {
                        p->~T();		// explicit destructor call
                        a.deallocate(p);
                }
        }
</pre>
Now, we can write:
<pre>
        destroy(p1,a1);
        destroy(p2,a2);
        destroy(p3,a3);
</pre>
If an Arena keeps track of what objects it holds, you can even write destroy()
to defend itself against mistakes.
<p>
It is also possible to define a matching operator new() and operator delete()
pairs for a class hierarchy

<h2><a name="no-derivation">
Can I stop people deriving from my class?</a></h2>
<p>
Yes, but why do you want to? There are two common answers:
<ul>
<li> for efficiency: to avoid my function calls being virtual
<li> for safety: to ensure that my class is not used as a base class
	(for example, to be sure that I can copy objects without fear
	of slicing) 
</ul>
In my experience, the efficiency reason is usually misplaced fear.
In C++, virtual function calls are so fast that their real-world use for
a class designed with virtual functions does not to produce measurable
run-time overheads compared to alternative solutions using ordinary
function calls.
Note that the virtual function call mechanism is typically used only when
calling through a pointer or a reference.
When calling a function directly for a named object, the virtual function
class overhead is easily optimized away.
<p>
If there is a genuine need for "capping" a class hierarchy to avoid virtual
function calls, one might ask why those functions are virtual in the first
place. I have seen examples where performance-critical functions had been
made virtual for no good reason, just because "that the way we usually do it".
<p>
The other variant of this problem, how to prevent derivation for logical
reasons, has a solution.
Unfortunately, that solution is not pretty.
It relies on the fact that the most derived class in a hierarchy must construct
a virtual base.
For example:
<pre>
	class Usable;

	class Usable_lock {
		friend class Usable;
	private:
		Usable_lock() {}
		Usable_lock(const Usable_lock&) {}
	};

	class Usable : public virtual Usable_lock {
		// ...
	public:
		Usable();
		Usable(char*);
		// ...
	};

	Usable a;

	class DD : public Usable { };

	DD dd;  // error: DD::DD() cannot access
        	// Usable_lock::Usable_lock(): private  member

<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="friend">
Does "friend" violate encapsulation?</a></h2>
No.
It does not.
"Friend" is an explicit mechanism for granting access, just like membership.
You cannot (in a standard conforming program) grant yourself access to a
class without modifying its source.
For example:
<pre>
	class X {
		int i;
	public:
		void m();	// grant X::m() access
		void f(X&);	// grant f(X&) access
		// ...
	};

	void X::m() { i++; /* X::m() can access X::i */ }

	void f(X& x) { x.i++; /* f(X&) can access X::i */ }

<h2><a name="bootstrapping">
Which language did you use to write C++?</a></h2>
The first C++ compiler (Cfront) was written in C++.
To build that, I first used C to write a "C with Classes"-to-C preprocessor.
"C with Classes" was a C dialect that became the immediate ancestor to C++.
That preprocessor translated "C with Classes" constructs (such as classes
and constructors) into C.
It was a traditional preprocessor in that it didn't undestand all of the
language, left most of the type checking for the C compiler to do,
and translated individual
constructs without complete knowledge. 
I then wrote the first version of Cfront in "C with Classes".
<p>
Cfront was a traditional compiler that did complete syntax and semantic
checking of the C++ source.
For that, it had a complete parser, built symbol tables, and built a complete
internal tree representation of each class, function, etc.
It also did some source level optimization on its internal tree representation
of C++ constructs before outputting C.
The version that generated C, did not rely on C for any type checking.
It simply used C as an assembler.
The resulting code was uncompromisingly fast.
For more information, see <a href="dne.html">D&E</a>.

<h2><a name="not-overloaded">
Why can't I overload . ->* :: ?: and sizeof?</a></h2>
To be written.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="pointers-and-references">
Why does C++ have both pointers and references?</a></h2>
C++ inherited pointers from C, so I couldn't remove them without causing
serious compatibility problems.
References are useful for several things, but the direct reason I introduced
them in C++ was to support operator overloading.
For example:
<pre>
	void f1(const complex* x, const complex* y)	// without references
	{
		complex z = *x+*y;	// ugly
		// ...
	}

	void f2(const complex& x, const complex& y)	// with references
	{
		complex z = x+y;	// better
		// ...
	}	
</pre>
More generally, if you want to have both the functionality of pointers and the functionality of references, you need either two different types (as in C++)
or two different sets of operations on a single type.
For example, with a single type you need both an operation to assign to the
object referred to and an operation to assign to the reference/pointer.
This can be done using separate operators (as in Simula). For example:
<pre>
	Ref&lt;My_type> r :- new My_type;
	r := 7;			// assign to object
	r :- new My_type;	// assign to reference
</pre>
Alternatively, you could rely on type checking (overloading).For example:
<pre>
	Ref&lt;My_type> r = new My_type;
	r = 7;			// assign to object
	r = new My_type;	// assign to reference
</pre>

<a href="#no-derivation">There didn't seem to be a sufficient need</a>.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="null">
Should I use NULL or 0?</a></h2>
In C++, the definition of NULL is 0, so there is only an aesthetic difference.
I prefer to avoid macros, so I use 0.
Another problem with NULL is that people sometimes mistakenly believe that it
is different from 0 and/or not an integer.
In pre-standard code, NULL was/is sometimes defined to something unsuitable
and therefore had/has to be avoided. That's less common these days.
<hr>
<h2><a name="layout">
How are C++ objects laid out in memory?</a></h2>
Like C, C++ doesn't define layouts, just semantic constraints that must
be met. Therefore different implementations do things differently.
Unfortunately, the best explanation I know of is in a book that is
otherwise outdated and doesn't describe any current C++ implementation:
<a href="arm.html">The Annotated C++ Reference Manual</a>
(usually called the ARM). It has diagrams of key layout examples.
There is a very brief explanation in Chapter 2 of
<a href="3rd.html">TC++PL</a>.
<p>
Basically, C++ constructs objects simply by concatenating sub objects. Thus
<pre>
        struct A { int a,b; };
</pre>
is represented by two ints next to each other, and 
<pre>
        struct B : A { int c; };
</pre>
is represented by an A followed by an int; that is, by three ints next to
each other.
<p>
Virtual functions are typically implemented by adding a pointer (the vptr)
to each object of a class with virtual functions. This pointer points to
the appropriate table of functions (the vtbl). Each class has its own vtbl
shared by all objects of that class.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="constraints">
Why can't I define constraints for my template parameters?</a></h2>
Well, you can, and it's quite easy and general.
<p>
Consider:
<pre>
        template&lt;class Container>
        void draw_all(Container& c)
        {
                for_each(c.begin(),c.end(),mem_fun(&Shape::draw));
        }
</pre>
If there is a type error, it will be in the resolution of the fairly
complicated for_each() call. For example, if the element type of the
container is an int,
then we get some kind of obscure error related to the for_each()
call (because we can't invoke Shape::draw() for an int). 
<p>
To catch such errors early, I can write:
<pre>
        template&lt;class Container>
        void draw_all(Container& c)
        {
                Shape* p = c.front(); // accept only containers of Shape*s

                for_each(c.begin(),c.end(),mem_fun(&Shape::draw));
        }
</pre>
The initialization of the spurious variable "p" will trigger a comprehensible
error message from most current compilers. Tricks like this are common
in all languages and have to be developed for all novel constructs.
In production code, I'd probably write something like: 
<pre>
	template&lt;class Container>
        void draw_all(Container& c)
        {
                typedef typename Container::value_type T;
                Can_copy&lt;T,Shape*>(); // accept containers of only Shape*s

                for_each(c.begin(),c.end(),mem_fun(&Shape::draw));
        }
</pre>
This makes it clear that I'm making an assertion.
The Can_copy template can be defined like this:
<pre>
	template&lt;class T1, class T2> struct Can_copy {
		static void constraints(T1 a, T2 b) { T2 c = a; b = a; }
		Can_copy() { void(*p)(T1,T2) = constraints; }
	};
</pre>
Can_copy checks (at compile time) that a T1 can be assigned to a T2.
Can_copy&lt;T,Shape*> checks that T is a Shape* or a pointer to
a class publicly derived from Shape* or a type with a user-defined conversion
to Shape*.
Note that the definition is close to minimal:
<ul>
<li>
one line to name the constraints to be checked and the types for which
to check them
<li>
one line to list the specific constraints checked (the constraints() function)
<li>
one line to provide a way to trigger the check (the constructor)
</ul>
<p>
Note also that the definition has the desirable properties that
<ul>
<li>
You can express constraints without declaring or copying variables,
thus the writer of a constraint doesn't have to make assumptions about
how a type is initialized, whether objects can be copied, destroyed, etc.
(unless, of course, those are the properties being tested by the constraint)
<li>
No code is generated for a constraint using current compilers
<li>
No macros are needed to define or use constraints
<li>
Current compilers give acceptable error messages for a failed constraint,
including the word "constraints" (to give the reader a clue), the name of
the constraints, and the specific error that caused the failure (e.g. "cannot
initialize Shape* by double*")
</ul>
<p>
So why is something like Can_copy() - or something even more elegant - not in
the language?
<a href="dne.html">D&E</a>
contains an analysis of the difficulties involved in expressing general
constraints for C++.
Since then, many ideas have emerged for making these constraints classes
easier to write and still trigger good error messages. For example,
I believe the use of a pointer to function the way I do in Can_copy
originates with Alex Stepanov and Jeremy Siek.
I don't think that
Can_copy() is quite ready for standardization - it needs more use.
Also, different forms of constraints are in use in the C++ community;
there is not yet a consensus on exactly what form of constraints templates
is the most effective over a wide range of uses.
<p>
However, the idea is very general, more general than language facilities
that have been proposed and provided specifically for constraints checking.
After all, when we write
a template we have the full expressive power of C++ available.
Consider:
<pre>
	template&lt;class T, class B> struct Derived_from {
		static void constraints(T* p) { B* pb = p; }
		Derived_from() { void(*p)(T*) = constraints; }
	};

	template&lt;class T1, class T2> struct Can_copy {
		static void constraints(T1 a, T2 b) { T2 c = a; b = a; }
		Can_copy() { void(*p)(T1,T2) = constraints; }
	};

	template&lt;class T1, class T2 = T1> struct Can_compare {
		static void constraints(T1 a, T2 b) { a==b; a!=b; a&lt;b; }
		Can_compare() { void(*p)(T1,T2) = constraints; }
	};

	template&lt;class T1, class T2, class T3 = T1> struct Can_multiply {
		static void constraints(T1 a, T2 b, T3 c) { c = a*b; }
		Can_multiply() { void(*p)(T1,T2,T3) = constraints; }
	};

	struct B { };
	struct D : B { };
	struct DD : D { };
	struct X { };

	int main()
	{
		Derived_from&lt;D,B>();
		Derived_from&lt;DD,B>();
		Derived_from&lt;X,B>();
		Derived_from&lt;int,B>();
		Derived_from&lt;X,int>();

		Can_compare&lt;int,float>();
		Can_compare&lt;X,B>();
		Can_multiply&lt;int,float>();
		Can_multiply&lt;int,float,double>();
		Can_multiply&lt;B,X>();
	
		Can_copy&lt;D*,B*>();
		Can_copy&lt;D,B*>();
		Can_copy&lt;int,B*>();
	}

	// the classical "elements must derived from Mybase*" constraint:

	template&lt;class T> class Container : Derived_from&lt;T,Mybase> {
		// ...
	};
</pre>
Actually, Derived_from doesn't check derivation, but conversion, but that's
often a better constaint.
Finding good names for constraints can be hard.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="sort">
Why use sort() when we have "good old qsort()"?</a></h2>
To a novice,
<pre>
	qsort(array,asize,sizeof(elem),elem_compare);
</pre>
looks pretty weird, and is harder to understand than
<pre>
	sort(vec.begin(),vec.end());
</pre>
To an expert, the fact that sort()
tends to be faster than qsort()
for the same elements and the same comparison criteria is often significant.
Also, sort() is generic, so that it can be used for any reasonable
combination of container type, element type, and comparison criterion.
For example:
<pre>
	struct Record {
		string name;
		// ...
	};

	struct name_compare {	// compare Records using "name" as the key
		bool operator()(const Record& a, const Record& b) const
			{ return a.name&lt;b.name; }
	};

	void f(vector&lt;Record>& vs)
	{
		sort(vs.begin(), vs.end(), name_compare());
		// ...
	}	
</pre>
<p>
In addition, most people appreciate that sort() is type safe, that no casts
are required to use it, and that they don't have to write a compare() function for
standard types.
<p>
For a more detailed explanation, see my paper
"Learning C++ as a New language", which you can download from my
<a href="papers.html">publications list</a>.
<p>
The primary reason that sort() tends to outperform qsort() is that the
comparison inlines better.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="function-object">
What is a function object?</a></h2>
An object that in some way behaves like a function, of course.
Typically, that would mean an object of a class that defines the application
operator - operator().
<p>
A function object is a more general concept
than a function because a function object
can have state that persist across several calls (like a static local variable)
and can be initialized and examined from outside the object (unlike a static
local variable).
For example:
<pre>
	class Sum {
		int val;
	public:
		Sum(int i) :val(i) { }
		operator int() const { return val; }		// extract value

		int operator()(int i) { return val+=i; }	// application
	};

	void f(vector<int> v)
	{
		Sum s = 0;	// initial value 0
		s = for_each(v.begin(), v.end(), s);	// gather the sum of all elements
		cout << "the sum is " << s << "\n";
		
		// or even:
		cout << "the sum is " << for_each(v.begin(), v.end(), Sum(0)) << "\n";
	}
</pre>
Note that a function object with an inline application operator inlines
beautifully because there are no pointers involved that might confuse
optimizers. To contrast: current optimizers are rarely (never?) able to
inline a call through a pointer to function.
<p>
Function objects are extensively used to provide flexibility in the standard
library.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="memory-leaks">
How do I deal with memory leaks?</a></h2>
By writing code that doesn't have any. Clearly, if your code has new
operations, delete operations, and pointer arithmetic all over the place,
you are going to mess up
somewhere and get leaks, stray pointers, etc.
This is true independently of how conscientious you are with your allocations:
eventually the complexity
of the code will overcome the time and effort you can afford.
It follows that successful
techniques rely on hiding allocation and deallocation inside more manageable
types.
Good examples are the standard containers. They manage memory for their
elements better than you could without disproportional effort.
Consider writing this without the help of string and vector:
<pre>
	#include&lt;vector>
	#include&lt;string>
	#include&lt;iostream>
	#include&lt;algorithm>
	using namespace std;

	int main()	// small program messing around with strings
	{
		cout << "enter some whitespace-separated words:\n";
		vector&lt;string> v;
		string s;
		while (cin>>s) v.push_back(s);

		sort(v.begin(),v.end());

		string cat;
		typedef vector&lt;string>::const_iterator Iter;
		for (Iter p = v.begin(); p!=v.end(); ++p) cat += *p+"+";
		cout << cat << '\n';
	}
</pre>
What would be your chance of getting it right the first time? And how would
you know you didn't have a leak?
<p>
Note the absence of explicit memory
management, macros, casts, overflow checks, explicit size limits, and
pointers. By using a function object and a standard algorithm, I could have
eliminated the pointer-like use of the iterator, but that seemed overkill
for such a tiny program.
<p>
These techniques are not perfect and it is not always easy to use them
systematically. However, they apply surprisingly widely and by reducing
the number of explicit allocations and deallocations you make the remaining
examples much easier to keep track of.
As early as 1981, I pointed out that by reducing the number of objects that
I had to keep track of explicitly from many tens of thousands to a few dozens,
I had reduced the intellectual effort needed to get the program right from
a Herculean task to something manageable, or even easy.
<p>
If your application area doesn't have libraries that make programming that
minimizes explicit memory management easy, then the fastest way of getting
your program complete and correct might be to first build such a library.
<p>
Templates and the standard libraries make this use of containers, resource
handles, etc., much easier than it was even a few years ago. The use of
exceptions makes it close to essential.
<p>
If you cannot handle allocation/deallocation implicitly as part of an object
you need in your application anyway, you can use a resource handle
to minimize the chance of a leak.
Here is an example where I need to return an object allocated on the free store
from a function.
This is an opportunity to forget to delete that object.
After all, we cannot tell just looking at pointer whether it needs to be
deallocated and if so who is responsible for that.
Using a resource handle, here the standard library auto_ptr, makes it clear
where the responsibility lies:
<pre>
	#include&lt;memory>
	#include&lt;iostream>
	using namespace std;

	struct S {
		S() { cout << "make an S\n"; }
		~S() { cout << "destroy an S\n"; }
		S(const S&) { cout << "copy initialize an S\n"; }
		S& operator=(const S&) { cout << "copy assign an S\n"; }
	};

	S* f()
	{
		return new S;	// who is responsible for deleting this S?
	};

	auto_ptr&lt;S> g()
	{
		return auto_ptr&lt;S>(new S);	// explicitly transfer responsibility for deleting this S
	}

	int main()
	{
		cout << "start main\n";
		S* p = f();
		cout << "after f() before g()\n";
	//	S* q = g();	// caught by compiler
		auto_ptr&lt;S> q = g();
		cout << "exit main\n";
		// leaks *p
		// implicitly deletes *q
	}
</pre>
<p>
Think about resources in general, rather than simply about memory.
<p>
If systematic application of these techniques is not possible in your
environment (you have to use code from elsewhere, part of your program
was written by Neanderthals, etc.), be sure to use a memory leak detector
as part of your standard development procedure, or plug in a garbage
collector.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="resume">
Why can't I resume after catching an exception?</a></h2>
In other words, why doesn't C++ provide a primitive for returning to the
point from which an exception was thrown and continuing execution from there?
<p>
Basically, someone resuming from an exception handler can never be sure that
the code after the point of throw was written to deal with the excecution
just continuing as if nothing had happened. An exception handler cannot know
how much context to "get right" before resuming.
To get such code right, the writer of the throw and the writer of the catch
need intimate knowledge of each others code and context. This creates a
complicated mutual dependency that wherever it has been allowed has led to
serious maintenance problems.
<p>
I seriously considered the possibility
of allowing resumption when I designed the C++ exception handling mechanism
and this issue was discussed in quite some detail during standardization.
See the exception handling chapter of
<a href="dne.html">The Design and Evolution of C++</a>.
<p>
If you want to check to see if you can fix a problem before throwing an
exception, call a function that checks and then throws only if the problem
cannot be dealt with locally. A new_handler is an example of this.

Also, please remember that contrary to naive expectations,
realloc() occationally do copy its argument array.

<h2><a name="finally">
Why doesn't C++ provide a "finally" construct?</a></h2>
Because C++ supports an alternative that is almost always better:
The "resource acquisition is initialization" technique (TC++PL3 section 14.4).
The basic idea is to represent a resource by a local object, so that the
local object's destructor will release the resource. That way, the programmer
cannot forget to release the resource.
For example:
<pre>
	class File_handle {
		FILE* p;
	public:
		File_handle(const char* n, const char* a)
			{ p = fopen(n,a); if (p==0) throw Open_error(errno); }
		File_handle(FILE* pp)
			{ p = pp; if (p==0) throw Open_error(errno); }

		~File_handle() { fclose(p); }

		operator FILE*() { return p; }

		// ...
	};

	void f(const char* fn)
	{
		File_handle f(fn,"rw");	// open fn for reading and writing
		// use file through f
	}
</pre>
In a system, we need a "resource handle" class for each resource. However,
we don't have to have an "finally" clause for each acquisition of a resource.
In realistic systems, there are far more resource acquisitions than kinds
of resources, so the "resource acquisition is initialization" technique leads
to less code than use of a "finally" construct.
<p>
Also, have a look at the examples of resource management in

<h2><a name="auto_ptr">
What is an auto_ptr and why isn't there an auto_array?</a></h2>
An auto_ptr is an example of very simple handle class, defined in &lt;memory>,
supporting exception safety using the
<a href="#finally">resource acquisition is initialization</a> technique.
An auto_ptr holds a pointer, can be used as a pointer, and deletes the object
pointed to at the end of its scope.
For example:
<pre>
	#include&lt;memory>
	using namespace std;

	struct X {
		int m;
		// ..
	};

	void f()
	{
		auto_ptr&lt;X> p(new X);
		X* q = new X;

		p->m++;		// use p just like a pointer
		q->m++;
		// ...

		delete q;
	}
</pre>
If an exception is thrown in the ... part, the object held by p is correctly
deleted by auto_ptr's destructor while the X pointed to by q is leaked.
See TC++PL 14.4.2 for details.
<p>
Auto_ptr is a very lightweight class. In particular, it is *not* a reference
counted pointer. If you "copy" one auto_ptr into another, the assigned to
auto_ptr holds the pointer and the assigned auto_ptr holds 0.
For example:
<pre>
	#include&lt;memory>
	#include&lt;iostream>
	using namespace std;

	struct X {
		int m;
		// ..
	};

	int main()
	{
		auto_ptr&lt;X> p(new X);
		auto_ptr&lt;X> q(p);
		cout << "p " << p.get() << " q " << q.get() << "\n";
	}
</pre>
should print a 0 pointer followed by a non-0 pointer. For example:
<pre>
	p 0x0 q 0x378d0
</pre>
auto_ptr::get() returns the help pointer.
<p>
This "move semantics" differs from the usual "copy semantics", and can be
surprising. In particular, never use an auto_ptr as a member of a standard
container. The standard containers require the usual copy semantics.
For example:
<pre>
	std::vector&lt;auto_ptr&lt;X> >v;	// error
</pre>
<p>
An auto_ptr holds a pointer to an indiviual element, not a pointer to an array:
<pre>
	void f(int n)
	{
		auto_ptr&lt;X> p(new X[n]);	// error
		// ...
	}
</pre>
This is an error because the destructor will delete the pointer using "delete"
rather than "delete[]" and will fail to invoke the destructor for the last n-1
Xs.
<p>
So should we use an auto_array to hold arrays? No. There is no auto_array.
The reason is that there isn't a need for one. A better solution is to use
a vector:
<pre>
	void f(int n)
	{
		vector&lt;X> v(n);
		// ...
	}
</pre>
Should an exception occur in the ... part, v's destructor will be correctly
invoked. 
<hr>
<h2><a name="realloc">
Can I mix C-style and C++ style allocation and deallocation?</a></h2>
Yes, in the sense that you can use malloc() and new in the same program.
<p>
No, in the sense that you cannot allocate an object with malloc() and free it
using delete. Nor can you allocate with new and delete with free() or use
realloc() on an array allocated by new.
<p>
The C++ operators new and delete guarantee proper construction and destruction;
where constructors or destructors need to be invoked, they are. The C-style
functions malloc(), calloc(), free(), and realloc() doesn't ensure that.
Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the mechanism use by new and delete
to acquire and release raw memory is compatible with malloc() and free().
If mixing styles works on your system, you were simply "lucky" - for now.
<p>
If you feel the need for realloc() - and many do - then consider
using a standard library vector.
For example
<pre>
	// read words from input into a vector of strings:

	vector&lt;string> words;
	string s;
	while (cin>>s && s!=".") words.push_back(s);
</pre>
The vector expands as needed.
<p>

Language", which you can download from my

<hr>
<h2><a name="void-ptr">
Why must I use a cast to convert from void*?</a></h2>
<p>
In C, you can implicitly convert a void* to a T*. This is unsafe. Consider:
<pre>
	#include&lt;stdio.h>

	int main()
	{
		char i = 0;
		char j = 0;
		char* p = &i;
		void* q = p;
		int* pp = q;	/* unsafe, legal C, not C++ */

		printf("%d %d\n",i,j);
		*pp = -1;	/* overwrite memory starting at &i */
		printf("%d %d\n",i,j);
	}
</pre>
The effects of using a T* that doesn't point to a T can be disastrous.
Consequently, in C++, to get a T* from a void* you need an explicit cast.
For example, to get the undesirable effects of the program above, you have to
write:
<pre>
		int* pp = (int*)q;
</pre>
or, using a new style cast to make the unchecked type conversion operation more visible:
<pre>
		int* pp = static_cast&lt;int*>(q);
</pre>
Casts are best avoided.
<p>
One of the most common uses of this unsafe conversion in C is to assign the
result of malloc() to a suitable pointer. For example:
<pre>
	int* p = malloc(sizeof(int));
</pre>
In C++, use the typesafe new operator:
<pre>
	int* p = new int;
</pre>
Incidentally, the new operator offers additional advantages over malloc():
<ul>
<li>
new can't accidentally allocate the wrong amount of memory,
<li>
new implicitly checks for memory exhaustion, and
<li>
new provides for initialization
</ul>
For example:
<pre>
	typedef std::complex&lt;double> cmplx;

	/* C style: */
	cmplx* p = (cmplx*)malloc(sizeof(int));	/* error: wrong size */
							/* forgot to test for p==0 */
	if (*p == 7) { /* ... */ }			/* oops: forgot to initialize *p */

	// C++ style:
	cmplx* q = new cmplx(1,2); // will throw bad_alloc if memory is exhausted
	if (*q == 7) { /* ... */ }
</pre>
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="in-class">
How do I define an in-class constant?</a></h2>
<p>
If you want a constant that you can use in a constant expression, say as
an array bound, you have two choices:
<pre>
class X {
	static const int c1 = 7;
	enum { c2 = 19 };

	char v1[c1];
	char v2[c2];

	// ...
};
</pre>
At first glance, the declaration of c1 seems cleaner, but note that to use
that in-class initialization syntax, the constant must be a static const of
integral or enumeration type initialized by a constant expression.
That's quite restrictive:
<pre>
class Y {
	const int c3 = 7;		// error: not static
	static int c4 = 7;		// error: not const
	static const float c5 = 7;	// error not integral
};
</pre>
I tend to use the "enum trick" because it's portable and doesn't tempt me
to use non-standard extensions of the in-class initialization syntax.
<p>
So why do these inconvenient restrictions exist?
A class is typically declared in a header file and a header file is typically
included into many translation units.
However, to avoid complicated linker rules, C++ requires that every object
has a unique definition.
That rule would be broken if C++ allowed in-class definition of entities
that needed to be stored in memory as objects.
See
<a href="dne.html">D&E</a> for an explanation of C++'s design tradeoffs.
<p>
You have more flexibility if the const isn't needed for use in a constant
expression:
<pre>
	class Z {
		static char* p;		// initialize in definition
		const int i;		// initialize in constructor
	public:
		Z(int ii) :i(ii) { }
	};

	char* Z::p = "hello, there";
</pre>
You can take the address of a static member if (and only if) it has an
out-of-class definition:
<pre>
	class AE {
		// ...
	public:
		static const int c6 = 7;
		static const int c7 = 31;
	};

	const int AE::c7;	// definition

	int f()
	{
		const int* p1 = &AE::c6;	// error: c6 not an lvalue
		const int* p2 = &AE::c7;	// ok
		// ...
	}
</pre>
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="delete-zero">
Why doesn't delete zero out its operand?</a></h2>
Consider
<pre>
	delete p;
	// ...
	delete p;
</pre>
If the ... part doesn't touch p then the second "delete p;" is a serious error
that a C++ implementation cannot effectively protect itself against (without
unusual precautions).
Since deleting a zero pointer is harmless by definition, a simple solution
would be for "delete p;" to do a "p=0;" after it has done whatever else
is required.
However, C++ doesn't gurantee that.
<p>
One reason is that the operand of delete need not be an lvalue. Consider:
<pre>
	delete p+1;
	delete f(x);
</pre>
Here, the implementation of delete does not have a pointer to which it can
assign zero.
These examples may be rare, but they do imply that it is not possible to
guarantee that ``any pointer a to deleted object is 0.''
A simpler way of bypassing that ``rule'' is to have two pointers to an
object:
<pre>
	T* p = new T;
	T* q = p;
	delete p;
	delete q;	// ouch!
</pre>
C++ explicitly allows an implementation of delete to zero out an lvalue
operand, and I
had hoped that implementations would do that, but that idea doesn't
seem to have become popular with implementers.
<p>
If you consider zeroing out pointers important, consider using a destroy
function:
<pre>
	template&lt;class T> inline void destroy(T*& p) { delete p; p = 0; }
</pre>
<p>
Consider this yet-another reason to minimize explicit use of
new and delete by relying on stadard library containers, handles, etc.
<p>
Note that passing the pointer as a reference (to allow the pointer to be
zero'd out) has the added benefit of preventing destroy() from being called
for an rvalue:
<pre>
	int* f();
	int* p;
	// ...
	destroy(f());	// error: trying to pass an rvalue by non-const reference
	destroy(p+1);	// error: trying to pass an rvalue by non-const reference
</pre>
<hr>
<h2><a name="void-main">
Can I write "void main()"?</a></h2>
The definition
<pre>
	void main() { /* ... */ }
</pre>
is not and never has been C++, nor has it even been C.
See the ISO C++ standard 3.6.1[2] or the ISO C standard 5.1.2.2.1.
A conforming implementation accepts
<pre>
	int main() { /* ... */ }
</pre>
and
<pre>
	int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { /* ... */ }
</pre>
A conforming implementation may provide more versions of main(),
but they must all have return type int.
The int returned by main() is a way for a program to return a value
to "the system" that invokes it. On systems that doesn't provide such a
facility the return value is ignored, but that doesn't make "void main()"
legal C++ or legal C.
Even if your compiler accepts "void main()" avoid it, or risk being considered
ignorant by C and C++ programmers.
<p>
In C++ main() need not contain an explicit return statement. In that case, the
value returned is 0, meaning successful execution.
For example:
<pre>
	#include&lt;iostream>

	int main()
	{
		std::cout << "This program returns the integer value 0\n";
	}
</pre>
Note also that neither ISO C++ nor C99 allows you to leave the type out of a
declaration. That is, in contrast to C89 and ARM C++ ,"int" is not assumed
where a type is missing in a declaration.
Consequently:
<pre>
	#include&lt;iostream>

	main() { /* ... */ }
</pre>
is an error because the return type of main() is missing.
<hr>
<h2><a name="overload-dot">
Why can't I overload dot, ::, sizeof, etc.?</a></h2>
Most operators can be overloaded by a programmer. The exceptions are
<pre>
	. (dot)  ::  ?:  sizeof
</pre>
There is no fundamental reason to disallow overloading of ?:.
I just didn't see the need to introduce the special case of overloading
a ternary operator.
Note that a function overloading <i>expr1?expr2:expr3</i> would not be able to
guarantee that only one of <i>exper2</i> and <i>expr3</i> was executed.
<p>
Sizeof cannot be overloaded because built-in operations, such as incrementing
a pointer into an array implicitly depends on it. Consider:
<pre>
	X a[10];
	X* p = &a[3];
	X* q = &a[3];
	p++;	// <i>p points to a[4]</i>
		// <i>thus the integer value of p must be</i>
		// <i>sizeof(X) larger than the integer value of q</i>
</pre>
Thus, sizeof(X) could not be given a new and different meaning by the
programmer without violating basic language rules.
<p>
In N::m neither N nor m are expressions with values; N and m are names known
to the compiler and :: performs a (compile time) scope resolution rather
than an expression evaluation. One could imagine allowing overloading of x::y
where x is an object rather than a namespace or a class, but that would - contrary to first appearences - involve introducing new syntax (to allow <i>expr::expr</i>). It is not obvious what benefits such a complication would bring. 
<p>
Operator . (dot) could in principle be overloaded using the same technique as
used for ->.
However, doing so can lead to questions about whether an operation is
meant for the object overloading . or an object referred to by . For example:
<pre>
	class Y {
	public:
		void f();
		// ...
	};

	class X {	// <i>assume that you can overload .</i>
		Y* p;
		Y& operator.() { return *p; }
		void f();
		// ...
	};

	void g(X& x)
	{
		x.f();	// X::f or Y::f or error?
	}
</pre> 
<p>
This problem can be solved in several ways.
At the time of standardization, it was not obvious which way would be best.

<h2><a name="int-to-string">
How do I convert an integer to a string?</a></h2>
The simplest way is to use a stringstream:
<pre>
	#include&lt;iostream>
	#include&lt;string>
	#include&lt;sstream>
	using namespace std;

	string itos(int i)	// convert int to string
	{
		stringstream s;
		s << i;
		return s.str();
	}

	int main()
	{
		int i = 127;
		string ss = itos(i);
		const char* p = ss.c_str();

		cout << ss << " " << p << "\n";
	}
</pre>
Naturally, this technique works for converting any type that you can output
using << to a string.
For a description of string streams, see 21.5.3 of
<a href="3rd.html">The C++ Programming Language</a>.
<hr>
<h2><a name="callC">
How do I call a C function from C++?</a></h2>
Just declare the C function ``extern "C"'' (in your C++ code) and call it
(from your C or C++ code).
For example:
<pre>
	// C++ code

	extern "C" void f(int);	// one way

	extern "C" {	// another way
		int g(double);
		double h();
	};

	void code(int i, double d)
	{
		f(i);
		int ii = g(d);
		double dd = h();
		// ...
	}
</pre>
The definitions of the functions may look like this:
<pre>
	/* C code: */

	void f(int i)
	{
		/* ... */
	}

	int g(double d)
	{
		/* ... */
	}

	double h()
	{
		/* ... */
	}

</pre>
Note that C++ type rules, not C rules, are used. So you can't call function
declared ``extern "C"'' with the wrong number of argument. For example:
<pre>
	// C++ code

	void more_code(int i, double d)
	{
		double dd = h(i,d);	// error: unexpected arguments
		// ...
	}
</pre>

<h2><a name="callCpp">

Just declare the C++ function ``extern "C"'' (in your C++ code) and call it

For example:
<pre>
	// C++ code:

	extern "C" void f(int);

	void f(int i)
	{
		// ...

Now f() can be used like this:
<pre>
	/* C code: */

	void f(int);
	
	void cc(int i)
	{
		f(i);
		/* ... */
	}
</pre>
Naturally, this works only for non-member functions. If you want to call
member functions (incl. virtual functions) from C, you need to provide a
simple wrapper.
For example:
<pre>
	// C++ code:

	class C {
		// ...
		virtual double f(char);
	};

	extern "C" double call_C_f(C* p, int i)	// wrapper function
	{
		return p->f(i);
	}
</pre>
Now C::f() can be used like this:
<pre>
	/* C code: */

	double call_C_f(struct C* p, int i);
	
	void ccc(struct C* p, int i)
	{
		double d = call_C_f(p,i);
		/* ... */
	}
</pre>
If you want to call overloaded functions from C, you must provide wrappers
with distinct names for the C code to use.
For example:
<pre>
	// C++ code:

	void f(int);
	void f(double);

	extern "C" void f_i(int i) { f(i); }
	extern "C" void f_d(double d) { f(d); }
</pre>
Now the f() functions can be used like this:
<pre>
	/* C code: */

	void f_i(int);
	void f_d(double);
	
	void cccc(int i,double d)
	{
		f_i(i);
		f_d(d);
		/* ... */
	}
</pre>
Note that these techniques can be used to call a C++ library from C code even
if you cannot (or do not want to) modify the C++ headers.

<h2><a name="whitespace">
Is ``int*  p;'' right or is ``int  *p;'' right?</a></h2>
Both are "right" in the sense that both are valid C and C++ and both
have exactly the same meaning. As far as the language definitions and
the compilers are concerned
we could just as well say ``int*p;'' or ``int * p;''
<p>
The choice between ``int* p;'' and ``int *p;'' is not about right and
wrong,
but about style and emphasis.
C emphasized expressions; declarations were
often considered little more than a necessary evil. C++, on the other
hand, has a heavy emphasis on types.
<p>
A ``typical C programmer'' writes ``int *p;'' and explains it ``*p is
what is the int'' emphasizing syntax, and may point to
the C (and C++) declaration grammar to argue for the correctness of the
style. Indeed, the * binds to the name p in the grammar.
<p>
A ``typical C++ programmer'' writes ``int* p;'' and explains it ``p is
a pointer to an int'' emphasizing type. Indeed the type of p is int*.
I clearly prefer that emphasis
and see it as important for using the more advanced parts of C++ well.
<p>
The critical confusion comes (only) when people try to declare several
pointers with a single declaration:
<pre>
	int* p, p1;	// probable error: p1 is not an int*
</pre>
Placing the * closer to the name does not make this kind of error
significantly less likely.
<pre>
	int *p, p1;	// probable error?
</pre>
Declaring one name per declaration minimizes the
problem - in particular when we initialize the variables. People are
far less likely to write:
<pre>
	int* p = &i;
	int p1 = p;	// error: int initialized by int*
</pre>
And if they do, the compiler will complain.
<p>
Whenever something can be done in two ways, someone will be confused.
Whenever something is a matter of taste, discussions can drag on
forever. Stick to one pointer per declaration and always initialize
variables
and the source of confusion disappears.
See
<a href="dne.html"> The Design and Evolution of C++</a>
for a longer discussion of the C declaration syntax.

<h2><a name="layout">
Which layout style is the best for my code?</a></h2>
Such style issues are a matter of personal taste.
Often, opinions about code layout are strongly held, but
probably consistency matters more than any particular style.
Like most people, I'd have a hard time constructing a solid logical argument
for my preferences.
<p>
I presonally use what is often called "K&R" style. When you add conventions
for constructs not found in C, that becomes what is sometimes called
"Stroustrup" style.
For example:
<pre>
class C : public B {
public:
	// ...
};

void f(int* p, int max)
{
	if (p) {
		// ...
	}

	for (int i = 0; i&lt;max; ++i) {
		// ...
	}
}
</pre>
This style conserves vertical space better than most layout styles,
and I like to
fit as much as is reasonable onto a screen. Placing the opening brace of a
function on a new line
helps me distinguish function definition from class definitions
at a glance.
<p>
Indentation is very important.
<p>
Design issues, such as the use of
<a href="#abstract-class">abstract classes for major interfaces</a>,
use of templates to present flexible type-safe abstractions, and
<a href="#exceptions">proper use of exceptions</a> to represent errors,
are far more important than the choice of layout style.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="constplacement">
Should I put "const" before or after the type?</a></h2>
I put it before, but that's a matter of taste. "const T"
and "T const" were always (both) allowed and equivalent.
For example:
<pre>
	const int a = 1;	// ok
	int const b = 2;	// also ok
</pre>
My guess is that using the first version will confuse fewer programmers
(``is more idiomatic'').
<p>
Why? When I invented "const" (initially named "readonly" and had a
corresponding "writeonly"), I allowed it to go before or after the type
because I could do so without ambiguity. Pre-standard C and C++ imposed few
(if any) ordering rules on specifiers.
<p>
I don't remember any deep thoughts or involved discussions about
the order at the time. A few of the early users - notably me - simply
liked the look of 
<pre>
	const int c = 10;
</pre>
better than
<pre>
	int const c = 10;
</pre>
at the time. 
<p>
I may have been influenced by the fact that my earliest examples
were written using "readonly" and
<pre>
	readonly int c = 10;
</pre>
does read better than
<pre>
	int readonly c = 10;
</pre>
The earliest (C or C++) code using "const" appears to have been
created (by me) by a global substitution of "const" for "readonly".
<p>
I remember discussing syntax alternatives with several people -
incl. Dennis Ritchie - but I don't remember which languages I looked at then.
<p>
Note that in const pointers, "const" always comes after the "*". For example:
<pre>
	int *const p1 = q;	// constant pointer to int variable
	int const* p2 = q;	// pointer to constant int
	const int* p3 = q;	// pointer to constant int
</pre>

<hr>
<h2><a name="macro">
So, what's wrong with using macros?</a></h2>
Macros do not obey the C++ scope and type rules.
This is often the cause of subtle and not-so-subtle problems.
Consequently, C++ provides alternatives that fit better with the rest of C++,
such as inline functions, templates, and namespaces.
<p>
Consider:
<pre>
	#include "someheader.h"

	struct S {
		int alpha;
		int beta;
	};
</pre>
If someone (unwisely) has written a macro called "alpha" or a macro called
"beta" this may not compile or (worse) compile into something unexpected.
For example, "someheader.h" may contain:
<pre>
	#define alpha 'a'
	#define beta b[2]
</pre>
Conventions such as having macros (and only macros) in ALLCAPS helps,
but there is no language-level protection against macros.
For example, the fact
that the member names were in the scope of the struct didn't help:
Macros operate on
a program as a stream of characters before the compiler proper sees it.
This, incidentally, is a major reason for C and C++ program development 
environments and tools have been unsophisticated: the human and the compiler
see different things.
<p>
Unfortunately, you cannot assume that other programmers consistently
avoid what you
consider "really stupid". For example, someone recently reported to me that
they had encountered a macro containing a goto. I have seen that also and
heard arguments that might - in a weak moment - appear to make sense.
For example:
<pre>
	#define prefix get_ready(); int ret__
	#define Return(i) ret__=i; do_something(); goto exit
	#define suffix exit: cleanup(); return ret__

	void f()
	{
		prefix;
		// ...
		Return(10);
		// ...
		Return(x++);
		//...
		suffix;
	}
</pre>
Imagine being presented with that as a maintenance programmer;
"hiding" the macros in a header - as is not uncommon - makes this kind of
"magic" harder to spot.
<p>
One of the most common subtle problems is that a function-style macro doesn't
obey the rules of function argument passing. For example:
<pre>
	#define square(x) (x*x)

	void f(double d, int i)
	{
		square(d);	// fine
		square(i++);	// ouch: means (i++*i++)
		square(d+1);	// ouch: means (d+1*d+1); that is, (d+d+1)
		// ...
	}
</pre>
The "d+1" problem is solved by adding parentheses in the "call" or in the
macro definition:
<pre>
	#define square(x) ((x)*(x))	/* better */
</pre>
However, the problem with the (presumably unintended) double evaluation of i++
remains.
<p>
And yes, I do know that there are things known as macros that doesn't suffer
the problems of C/C++ preprocessor macros.
However, I have no ambitions for improving C++ macros. 
Instead, I recommend the use of facilities from the C++ language proper,
such as inline functions, templates, constructors (for initialization),
destructors (for cleanup), exceptions (for exiting contexts), etc.
