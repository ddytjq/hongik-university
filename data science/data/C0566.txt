<B>Title:</B> CETA’S INTRODUCTION OF A NEW INCOME PROTECTION POLICY</a> |   <B>Release Date:</B> 04/03/2002<hr color="#505050" align="left"><br>Traditionally, Accident, Sickness and Unemployment (ASU) policies have been linked to mortgages.  However, with the rapid growth of the buy to let market and the growing number of people renting rather than purchasing a property, CETA, the UK’s largest general insurance network, has launched an income protection product which would be ideal for tenants.<br>
<br>
The new Safeguard Income Protection policy has been introduced as a result of demand from IFAs and mortgage brokers who have identified that there is a need for a product which protects the income of people living in rented accommodation.  In the event of a tenant being involved in an accident, becoming ill, losing their job or being hospitalised, policyholders will be able to continue to pay their rent and cover other essential living expenses.  <br>
<br>
The policy can be purchased through any of CETA’s 3000 members (predominantly IFAs and mortgage brokers).  The cost per £100 of cover for the accident, sickness, unemployment and hospitalisation product is £6.08 plus IPT.  It is underwritten by Groupama.<br>
<br>
The policy provides cover for a period of 12 months, following an exclusion period of 60 days.  Policyholders, who must have been in continuous employment for 6 months prior to taking out the policy, will be eligible to receive payments of up to 50% of their gross salary, subject to a maximum payment of £1500 per month.<br>
<br>
‘People living in rented accommodation face bigger risks than home owners if their income is threatened as they do not have an asset to sell’ commented David Quick, CETA’s, Managing Director.  ‘People rent for a variety of reasons but often it is a result of moving to a new area because of a new job.  With the economic outlook still quite uncertain, holders of this policy can rest assured that their immediate financial needs will be met if they are involved in a serious accident or loose their employment’.<br>
<br>
To be eligible for the policy, applicants must be:<br>
<br>
·	Aged between 18 and 60<br>
<br>
·	In paid work for an average of 16 hours or more per week<br>
<br>
·	A permanent resident in the UK, Channel Islands or the Isle of Man<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
·	Their employer must not currently be in merger / acquisition talks or within the last 12 months have announced a reduction in staff numbers<br>
<br>
·	Be aware of any impending unemployment or medical treatment  or advice<br>
<br>
There are no limits to the number of times a client can make a claim.  After each claim however, the exclusion period of 60 days will have to lapse before a further claim can be made.<br>
<br>
Self-employed workers are not eligible for cover under this policy.<br>
<br>
CETA believes the Safeguard Income Protection product, which earns a commission of 15%, will enable IFAs to offer their clients a more complete service and gain a competitive advantage over other intermediaries.<br>
<br>
‘It is a competitively priced product which addresses a real need’ added David Quick. ‘The initial feedback we have received from our members is that it is going to be very popular.  It is also good news for tenants and their landlords as both parties will have the certainty that, whatever happens, the rent will be paid for up 12 months’. <br>
