<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b><font color="#800040">Human DNA Sequencing<img SRC="HGPlogo1.jpg" height=107 width=108 align=RIGHT><br>
                  </font></b>The HGP's continued emphasis is on obtaining&nbsp; 
                  by 2003 a complete and highly accurate reference sequence (1 
                  error in 10,000 bases) that is largely continuous across all 
                  human chromosomes. Scientists believe that knowing this sequence 
                  is critically important for understanding human biology and 
                  for applications to other fields.<br>
                  </font><br>
                  <font face="Arial,Helvetica">A "working draft" of the sequence was
completed 18 months ahead of schedule, in June 2000. The achievement has
provided scientists worldwide with a road map to an estimated 90% of genes
on every chromosome. Although the draft contains gaps and errors and does
not yet meet the standard of accuracy outlined above, it provides a valuable
scaffold for generating a high-quality reference genome sequence. HGP scientists
make human DNA sequence available broadly, rapidly, and free of charge
via the Web.</font><b></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#800040">Sequencing Technology</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although current sequencing capacity is
far greater than at the inception of the HGP, further incremental progress
in sequencing technologies, efficiency, and cost-reduction are needed.
For future sequencing applications, planners emphasize the importance of
supporting novel technologies that may be 5 to 10 years in development.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#800040">Sequence Variation</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although more than 99% of human DNA sequences
are the same across the population, variations in DNA sequence can have
a major impact on how humans respond to disease; to such environmental
insults as bacteria, viruses, toxins, and chemicals; and to drugs and other
therapies.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Methods are being developed to detect different
types of variation, particularly the most common type called single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), which occur about once every 100 to 300 bases. Scientists
believe SNP maps will help them identify the multiple genes associated
with such complex diseases as cancer, diabetes, vascular disease, and some
forms of mental illness. These associations are difficult to establish
with conventional gene-hunting methods because a single altered gene may
make only a small contribution to disease risk.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#800040">Functional Genomics</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Efficient interpretation of the functions
of human genes and other DNA sequences requires that strategies be developed
to enable large-scale investigations across whole genomes. A first priority
is to generate complete sets of full-length cDNA clones and sequences for
human and model-organism genes. Other functional-genomics goals include
studies into gene expression and control and the development of experimental
and computational methods for understanding gene function.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#800040">Comparative Genomics</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The functions of human genes and other
DNA regions often are revealed by studying their parallels in nonhumans.
HGP researchers have obtained complete genomic sequences for the bacterium
Escherichia coli, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the fruit fly Drosophila
melanogaster, and the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. Sequencing continues
on the laboratory mouse. The availability of complete genome sequences
generated both inside and outside the HGP is driving a major breakthrough
in fundamental biology as scientists compare entire genomes to gain new
insights into evolutionary, biochemical, genetic, metabolic, and physiological
pathways.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#800040">Ethical, Legal,
and Social Implications (ELSI)</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Rapid advances in the science of genetics
and its applications present new and complex ethical and policy issues
for individuals and society. ELSI programs that identify and address these
implications have been an integral part of the U.S. HGP since its inception.
These programs have resulted in a body of work that promotes education
and helps guide the conduct of genetic research and the development of
related medical and public policies.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#800040">Bioinformatics
and Computational Biology</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Continued investment in current and new
databases and analytical tools is critical to the success of the HGP and
to the future usefulness of the data it produces. Databases must adapt
to the evolving needs of the scientific community and must allow queries
to be answered easily. Planners suggest developing a human genome database,
analogous to model organism databases, that will link to phenotypic information.
Also needed are databases and analytical tools for studying the expanding
body of gene-expression and functional data, for modeling complex biological
networks and interactions, and for collecting and analyzing sequence-variation
data.</font>
                <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#800040">Training</font></font></b> 
                  <br>
                  <font face="Arial,Helvetica">Future genome scientists will require 
                  training in interdisciplinary areas including biology, computer 
                  science, engineering, mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Also, 
                  scientists with management skills will be needed for leading 
                  large data-production efforts.</font>
