    Earnhardt's fatal accident last week at Daytona, safety in racing has received
    a lot of attention. &nbsp;A lot has been written and discussed concerning the HANS
    Device because Dale Earnhardt died of a Basal Skull Fracture.&nbsp; I firmly support the idea that drivers wear the HANS Device, however, there is
    another area of safety that needs to be addressed - Race Car Crumple
    Zones.&nbsp; More specifically, should the concrete walls be made soft and
    crumple, or should sections of the cars be made soft and crumple.&nbsp; That

      Rigidity is generally thought of as how stiff an object or a structure
      is.&nbsp; For example, a garden hose is not very stiff or rigid.&nbsp; In
      fact it bends under its own weight.&nbsp; However, a block of steel
      measuring 4&quot; on all sides is very rigid.&nbsp; Not only won't it bend
      under its own weight, it also bends very little when force is applied to
      it.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 3">A materials measure of stiffness
      is called Modulus of Elasticity.&nbsp; Steel, for example, has a very high
      modulus of Elasticity, whereas that garden hose, which is made of rubber,
      has a very low Modulus of Elasticity.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 3">However, just because a material
      has a high Modulus of Elasticity does not mean it is 'stiff'.&nbsp; A thin
      steel wire is not very stiff because it has a low Moment of Inertia.&nbsp;
      The Moment of Inertia of an object is the sum of the products of each mass element of
      the object multiplied by the square of its distance from an axis (usually
      the center of gravity).&nbsp; In layman's terms, if all the objects mass
      is located close to the center of gravity (think of the thin wire) it will
      have a low Moment of Inertia.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 3">By moving the mass away from the
      center of gravity, you increase the objects Moment of Inertia.&nbsp; As an
      example, a CART Champ Car chassis has a very high Moment of Inertia (both
      bending and torsional or twisting) because, as can be seen in the photo
      below, most of its mass is moved out to it extremities and the center is
      hollow.</font></p>

      'tub'.&nbsp; The&nbsp;<br>
      hollow area is where the fuel cell resides.</font></p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 3"><font face="Arial" size="2">Torsion,
      is twisting strain produced when a torque is applied to an object. For
      example, torsion is the strain experienced by a length of wire when a
      twisting force is applied to one end while the other end is fixed. Torsion
      can be measured by observing how much an object twists due to a given
      torque. For example, when a cylindrical object one unit long is twisted at
      one end, and the other end is held fixed, the amount the ends of the
      cylinder rotate relative to each other is a measure of the torsion.
      Engineering materials employed in rotating machine parts, such as engine
      crankshafts and ship-propeller shafts, must resist the torsional stresses induced by the twisting
      loads.&nbsp; Whereas Moment of Inertia is a measure of an objects ability
      to resist bending, Polar Moment of Inertia is the measure of an objects
      ability to resist twisting.</font></p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 3"><font face="Arial" size="2">A
      measure of an objects strength is directly related to <b>both</b> its
      Modulus of Elasticity and its Moment of Inertia or Polar Moment of
      Inertia.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 3">
      Generally, long slender objects are not rigid, and short stocky objects
      are.&nbsp; The hollow steel tubing used to make a Winston Cup frame is, by
      itself, not very rigid.&nbsp; It won't bend under its own weight like the
      hollow tubular rubber garden hose will because steel has a much higher
      Modulus of Elasticity than rubber, but it will bend when relatively very
      little force is applied to it.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 3">
      However, by making a space frame out of steel tubing, you can make a very
      strong and stiff structure.</p>

    you that the rigidity (see sidebar) of the chassis is a key component of a
    good handling race car.&nbsp; A good chassis is one that offers good
    torsional rigidity as well as transverse and lateral rigidity.&nbsp; A rigid
    chassis allows weight to be transferred from one end of the car to the
    other, from one side to the other, or diagonally from one corner to the
    other (Called cross-weight transfer).</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The most important measure of
    torsional rigidity is how much stiffness there is from the center of gravity
    of the car to the front axle and from the center of gravity to the rear
    axle. This is part of the front weight transfer equation. If the distance
    from the center of gravity to the front axle is larger than to the rear
    axle you will have more front weight transfer (before springs and tires

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Unfortunately, in an accident, a
    very rigid structure does not crumple much and, therefore, much of its
    Kinetic Energy is lost in a very short timeframe and the object decelerates
    very rapidly.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Crumple Zones</b></font><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
    In recent years, the automotive industry has improved the crash worthiness
    of passenger cars by the use of Crumple Zones in the front and rear of the
    cars. Crumple Zones are created by the integration of variable
    grades of steel and composites into the front and rear-end assemblies of the
    automobile.&nbsp; These Crumple Zones yield during impact, redirecting the
    energy of the collision, often reducing the chance of injury to the
    driver.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">This is best illustrated in the
    two examples below.&nbsp; The first example shows a solid steel block
    hitting a cement wall.&nbsp; The block does not crumple at all, stops almost
    instantly, and rebounds or bounces off with almost as much Kinetic Energy as
    it had just before it hit the wall.&nbsp; In the second example a Coke can
    hits a wall.&nbsp; However it crumples and deforms just as if you stepped on
    it, and much of its energy is dissipated over a period of time while the can
    crumples.</font></p>

    collapse of the safety cell and the intrusion of the wheels, engine or steering wheel
    which can be deadly) and has to be surrounded by a crumple zone that is not too stiff

    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">A trade-off has, therefore, to be found for the
    strength of the crumple zone: at low speed (25mph for example), the car (car
    #1) with a very soft crumple zone might inflict less damage to the driver than a car with a stronger crumple zone: the
    driver would be shaken badly in the 2nd car, yet the driver "wouldn't feel anything" in the first car.&nbsp;
    However, at 60 mph, the driver of the 1st car would probably be killed by the intrusion of the engine,
    the steering wheel, etc. where in the 2nd car, because of the " extra margin"
    allowed by the stronger crumple zone, the driver would probably be injured but still
    be alive.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">It is, therefore, possible to find a car
    (# 1) that manages to protect the driver better than car # 2 at a speed of
    25 mph, yet  car #2  could be safer than car #1 at a higher speed than 60 mph  because
    car #2 has a stronger crumple zone than car #1, allowing it a " last resort" extra safety
    margin that the driver would not have with car #1.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">That is why it is crucial to see how well the structure of a car performs in
    a crash test.&nbsp; Only the one whose structure hasn't started to collapse will allow
    the driver that extra safety margin in case of a stronger impact. Note that the size of the crumple zone is important : that is why,
    in general, minivans (with  shorter "noses") don't perform as well as cars in
    frontal crash tests.&nbsp; So crumple zones have to be "attached" to the stiffest cell possible and
    must not be too soft nor too strong!&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Crash tests results have nothing to do with the weight of the car
    tested.&nbsp; It has to do with how well the safety cell-crumple zone-restraint system combo have been designed.
    So if you drive a very light car with good crash tests results into a wall, you will be better off in that car than in a truck, even 2 times heavier,
    that would have "bad" crash tests results.&nbsp; However, if that truck hit the small car,
    even though that car has better crash test results than the truck, you'd be better off in the truck because
    of the weight difference.&nbsp; In general, you'd be safer in a heavy
    vehicle hitting a lighter vehicle, regardless on how it performs
    in crash tests.</font></p>

    <p align="left" style="margin-top: 1"><font face="Arial" size="2">Many
    people can't believe that Dale Earnhardt was killed at Daytona.&nbsp; The
    accident just didn't look that severe.&nbsp; Unfortunately I don't have any
    crash data to analyze because Winston Cup cars are not equipped with any
    CRASH boxes that are found on CART Champ Cars, F1 cars and IRL Indy
    cars.&nbsp; NASCAR is taking a lot of heat because of this.&nbsp; Therefore,
    it's hard for us to determine exactly what happened.&nbsp; Yes, his seat
    belt may have broken, and yes, the HANS Device very well may have saved
    him.&nbsp; However, the fact of the matter is that the vector component of
    speed that Earnhardt's car hit the turn 4 wall at Daytona was no more than
    55
    mph.&nbsp; Stop for one moment and think about driving your car into an
    immovable wall at 55 mph.&nbsp; I would not want to try it, even if it does
    have a crumple zone.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The one thing probably working
    against Earnhardt was the fact that the front of Winston Cup cars have
    become stiffer over the years in the search of better handling.&nbsp; In the
    photo to the right (top), one can see that, when finished, the front
    assembly of a modern Winston Cup car is relatively stiff compared to the
    back (bottom photo to right).&nbsp; That is one reason why drivers typically
    walk away unscathed in rear-end accidents - the backend of the car acts as a
    Crumple Zone, absorbing kinetic energy in the form of heat and sound as it
    folds up right to the back of the strong drivers compartment cage -&nbsp;
    much like the Coke can did in the example above.&nbsp; However, on front
    impacts, a modern Winston Cup car crumples up to a point near the front
    wheels, after which the chassis becomes very stiff, upon which deceleration
    becomes very rapid.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">A properly designed front
    Crumple Zone on a Winston Cup car would probably mean the end of cars going
    back out on the race track after an accident just to collect points.&nbsp;
    The front assembly would need to be designed to crumple in a more
    predictable manner than it does
    now.&nbsp; That would probably render the car unfixable at the race track,
    or at least might require a nose change before re-entering the race.&nbsp; I think it's better to make the cars safer in an attempt to
    save a drivers life, than to collect a few points trolling around the apron
    of the race track for three-quarters of the race.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Soft Cars vs. Soft Walls</b></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Typically, the most lethal
    accidents are those in which a race car hits an immovable concrete wall and
    the 'g' forces felt by the human body are not survivable.&nbsp; The crashes
    you see when a car goes somersaulting down the race track tend not to kill a
    driver because at no time does the driver decelerate too fast.&nbsp; While
    the car is somersaulting, it's losing kinetic energy over a relatively long
    period of time (seconds vs. milliseconds when you hit a concrete
    wall).&nbsp; Therefore, the race car industry has to take a serious look at
    the concrete wall impacts.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In order to lessen the blow to
    the driver, we are going to have to make a concerted effort to develop an
    acceptable 'soft' wall design, or we are going to have to design the race
    cars with Crumple Zones.&nbsp; Both ideas have their problems:</font></p>

    </ul>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">After studying this problem for
    awhile, I am of the opinion that without a doubt, soft walls work well for road courses and the inside walls of oval tracks.&nbsp; They should be
    implemented immediately everywhere.&nbsp; However, the outside walls of oval
    tracks present a much different problem, and the jury is still out as to
    whether a soft wall will work on outside walls.&nbsp; The sanctioning bodies
    must step forward and start testing the various products out on the market
    today to determine if a soft wall will work.&nbsp; It's too hard to model,
    only real live testing with properly instrumented cars will tell the whole
    story.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">If I had to guess right now, I
    might lean toward making the crumple happen in the car rather than the wall.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>What speed do you design for?</b></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">A lot of accident analysis has
    been done looking at the geometry of most oval tracks.&nbsp; Unless a race
    car gets down into the grass infield, the steepest angle the car could hit
    the wall is 30 degrees (that is the angle of impact of the cg of the car
    with the wall).&nbsp;In
    Earnhardt's case his impact was probably more like a 20 degree hit.&nbsp; The SIN of 30 degrees is 0.5.&nbsp; That means
    a car traveling at 100mph would be the equivalent of hitting the wall at
    50mph head-on.&nbsp; The FIA standard test for soft walls is also about
    50mph.&nbsp; Data has shown that most impacts with the outside concrete wall
    are equivalent to a 50mph head-on impact, or less.&nbsp; As I stated above,
    that's still pretty severe.</font></p>

      An object in motion has kinetic energy. The magnitude of the kinetic energy depends on both the mass and the speed of the object according to the equation:</p>

      </center>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 3; margin-bottom: 3">where m is the mass of the object and v2 is its speed multiplied by itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      = 658,222 ft-lb.</p>

      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 3; margin-bottom: 3">The change in a
      vehicles energy, ‘delta E’, can be derived from the equation:</p>
    <center>

      <p align="center" style="margin-top: 3; margin-bottom: 3"><b>‘delta E’

      applied to the mass, ‘m’, and ‘d’ is the distance through which
      ‘a’ acts.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, energy really does not enter into the
      analysis, but force, distance and time do.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 3; margin-bottom: 3">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 3; margin-bottom: 3">Similarly, using
      Newton's second law, <b>F = ma<br>
      </b>(3500/32.17) x (60 x 32.17), one can determine that same car
      will apply a constant force of 210,000 lb.<sup> </sup>against the wall it is
      hitting until it came to rest (assuming a linear deceleration).&nbsp; That force
      would be needed to design a properly stiff Crumple Zone.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      time, therefore, it will take that same car to decelerate so that the
      driver experiences no more than 60 g's is the change in velocity divided
      by the deceleration or, 110 fps/(60 x 32.17) = 0.057 sec.,
      or 57 milliseconds.&nbsp; That would be assuming that the Crumple Zone
      applied a constant resistance until the car stopped.&nbsp; In reality the resistance
      is not linear and the instantaneous deceleration is usually about twice as
      great, hence the time of 57 milliseconds is only approximate and why we
      used 75 mph for our analysis when in fact most collisions with the outside
      wall are under 55 mph.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 3; margin-bottom: 3">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 3; margin-bottom: 3"> Assuming we don't want the driver to experience any
      more than 60 g's (60 x 32.17 feet per sec<sup>2</sup>), an effective crumple zone in
      any race car hitting a wall at 110 fps and decelerating linearly to zero,
      regardless of weight, would have to be about
      3 feet long (110 fps/2 x 0.057 sec. = 3.135').&nbsp; That's assuming a
      75mph hit.&nbsp; If we use a more practical number, about 55mph, the
      distance is 2.3'.&nbsp; Another way to derive the same answer is to divide
      the Energy computed above (658,222 ft-lb) by the derived constant force of
      210,000 lb = that same 3.13 feet.&nbsp; Remember when your teacher tried
      to tell you that Energy = Force x Distance?&nbsp; It's really true!</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 3; margin-bottom: 3">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 3; margin-bottom: 3">In round numbers
      then, a properly designed Crumple Zone for a 3500 lb. stock car would be
      about 2.3 to 3 feet long, be able to sustain a consistent force of 210,000 lb. for a period of at least 57 milliseconds, while
      decelerating the car from 75 mph (component of speed of the cg of the car into the wall).&nbsp;
      Although the nose of today's Winston Cup cars are about 3' long before
      they crumple and the stiff part of the chassis is engaged, they crumple
      too easy and, therefore, don't keep the deceleration under 60 g's for a
      long enough period.&nbsp; Drivers are also
      questioning NASCAR's decision last year to increase the strength of the front-end roll bars from 93-hundreths to 125-hundreths steel. The stronger
      front-end bars could make the stiff part of the car less crushable. And there are complaints
      about crews being allowed to use chrome-moly alloy in the bars; that makes for stronger bars, but
      chrome-moly doesn't bend as easily as other
      steel and can actually fracture. Plus if welding isn't done just right, the
      welds can crystallize.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 3; margin-bottom: 3">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 3; margin-bottom: 3"> The challenge to NASCAR will be to add enough
      resistive materials in the first 3' of the car so that it acts like a properly
      designed Crumple Zone for the weight of their cars.&nbsp; And if that
      means using some form of honeycomb composite materials to do it, then so
      be it.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 3; margin-bottom: 3"> &nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 3; margin-bottom: 3"> Racing will never

      improvement.&nbsp; And they can start with the noses of their cars.</p>
