The Hubble Deep Field project showed how the telescope can be used to
view the end of the visible universe.  Would a bigger, better telescope
be beneficial to see that end even better or is there no need because
astronomers can see all that there is to see?<P>

Also, what is the length of time for the lifecycle of a supernova?<P>


<B>Dear Anthony,<BR>

As another astromer, Rachel Dewey, once said while discussing ground-based
radio telescopes, "bigger is always better."  A larger telescope would allow
detailed studies of objects we can only barely glimpse now.  Perhaps the
greatest change, however, would occur if the telescope were optimized
to see in the infrared rather than in the optical.   The redshift of
light emitted by very distant objects implies that the optical light we
observe now was emitted in the ultraviolet, but as Harry Ferguson discusses
on the main web page, intergalactic hydrogen throughout the universe
absorbs far-ultraviolet light.   Because of this effect, the Hubble
Deep Field discussed on the TV program only saw back to when the
universe was about 2 billion years old.  To see further we will need
to build a large space-based infrared telescope.  Fortunately, NASA is
considering building just such a telescope, which is presently referred
to as the Next Generation Space Telescope.<P>

A major reason that astrophysicists have had a difficult time modelling
supernovae is that there are many different timescales which are important
in understanding these impressive objects.   But supernovae will be discussed
on the second show in the series, so let's leave this question for just
a couple of days.<P>

Take care,<BR>

Name and City Withheld<P>
1.  Why are there so many double stars?<P>
2.  The Deep Space Hubble image is wonderfully beautiful.
What enhancements are done to create this image?  Does the
image reflect the impositions of any "ideal" galactic shapes
onto indistinct fuzzes?  It seems so clear that it is hard
to believe that a lot of assumptions weren't made in its
presentation...if we can see that far back so clearly, then
surely the horizon must be much further back...<P>

<B>
1. A binary system is the only gravitational system made up of equal partners
that has stable orbits.  Quasi-stable orbits are feasible in a hierarchical
system, like the solar system where the sun dominates.  But put three or more
equal objects together and not only do the orbits quickly become chaotic,
but often one of the objects is often thrown out by the other two!  As a
result we can expect triple and quadruple stars to be rare.   Computer
simulations of star formation show that the angular momentum in a collapsing
gas disk will frequently produce an instability that results in two separate
bodies forming.   But we don't yet really understand the difference between
the initial conditions that led our sun to be a single star while so many
of theirs are binaries.<P>

2. I'm glad you enjoyed the Hubble Deep Field image.  We do live in a very
beautiful universe.   And that really is the point; there were very few
enhancements made in producing the image.  It is a fairly accurate
representation of what your eye would see if only it were as sensitive
as the instruments at the back of Hubble Space Telescope.   There were
only two slight fudges:  1) the red filter used in the image is actually
a bitter further red than the eye can see (it is in the near infrared),
and 2) we used a new technique called "drizzling" to reduce the blurring
effects of the large pixels in the Wide Field camera.  But this is a very
mild enhancement (it was developed precisely to insure that we would
NOT introduce any artifacts into the galaxy images).   We made no assumptions
about the shapes of the galaxies.   But you are right, we are not quite
seeing to the "edge of the universe."  See Harry Ferguson's introduction
for a discussion of this question.<P>

Suppose theoretically, you could bore a 12" diameter hole all the way
through the earth. Then you drop a 10 lb. cannon ball down the hole. My
question is, what would happen? Would it come out the other side of the
earth or would it settle in the center of the earth or would it just
stay suspended above the hole? Thank you. I think PBS is great.  <BR>
Take care<BR>
Jeff<P>


<B>Hi Jeff,<BR>

Well you first want to drill the hole right along the earth's axis of
rotation, or else have the earth stop spinning, because otherwise the
ball will hit the side of the wall on its way down, since the
rotational velocity of a point in the earth is proportional to
its distance from the center.  But forgetting that complication, and
assuming you've completely evacuated the hole, then the ball would just
oscillate up and down.  It would rise to the surface on the other
side of the earth and then fall right back to the point from which you
dropped it, and it would go one doing this forever.
You see the ball is in orbit.  In fact, when an object, like the space
shuttle, is in orbit it is falling towards earth, but
it is moving so fast to one side that it misses the earth and just keeps
on falling.  In this case, the cannon ball is on a radial orbit, and
it misses the earth because you kindly moved the earth out of the way! <P>

Cheers,<BR>

I've been looking up all of my life (46 years worth) but have never
been financially fit for a telescope for deep-space viewing.  I am now
in that position and already have the 35 slr I want.  What is a good,
dependable telescope for someone who has unpolluted viewing from their
own back deck?  This scope will be with me and my husband for the rest
of our lives and there are too many to choose from for a real novice like me.<P>

Thanking you in advance!<P>

<B>Hi Jan,<BR>

I suggest that you contact a local skygazing group, and join them on
one of their outings.  I am sure that many of the people on the trip
will be glad to let you look through their telescopes and discuss
with you the pros and cons of the model they chose.   This way you
will be able to chose a telescope that is well suited to your needs.<P>

Happy observing!<BR>

I was "out to lunch" during the time the astronauts were repairing the
Hubble telescope. The 1st episode said that a flaw in the optics
impaired the telescope. Can you elaborate *just* a little (unless it's
way too technical); but more, can you say that since the repairs, the
telescope is now operating as it SHOULD have to begin with, or is it
going to remain compromised?<P>

Bravo to this little gem of a series! And to those astronomers!<P>

<B>
Hi Carter,<BR>

When the primary mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope was being polished,
a mistake was made in the measurement of its shape.  As a result the focal
"point" of the telescope instead became a focal "line".  The best focus
point for the light reflected from the telescope now depends on whether the
light has been reflected from near the edge of the mirror or from
near the center.  In a well polished mirror, all the light focuses at a
single point independent of where it hits the mirror.<P>

Fortunately, the corrections that have been made work wonderfully.  In
fact, the telescope now works better than the original designers
of the Hubble Space Telescope thought it would!   The error in the
primary mirror makes building new instruments for HST slightly more
complicated than had the primary been polished correctly
in the first place,  but the real effect on the final performance of
the telescope is minor.<P>

I'm glad you are enjoying the series. We are living in what must be
one of the golden eras of astronomy.<P>

All the best,<BR>

Al Cook <BR>
Sarasota, Fl<P>

Is it possible to orbit a second Hubble telescope and sync it with the
first to take advantage of the longer baseline for greater distance
observation, or is the vlba only usable with radio telescopes? If the
first half of the above is possible, are there plans afoot to build a
second?  Al<P>

<B>Hi Al,<BR>

Unfortunately, it is not feasible to make HST part of an interferometer.
However, there are plans to build a space-based optical interferometer, which will
have a span of 10 meters, and thus will have angular resolution several
times better than HST.  In the longer term, a much larger space-based
interferometer may be built to search for planets about other stars.   Both
of these interferometers will probably have their mirrors attached to a single
support structure.  We have yet to develop the technology that would allow
free-flying optical interferometric elements (in the radio the job is much
easier as the wavelengths are thousands of times larger);  however, if we
do perfect such technology we might someday be able to image the planets
in other solar systems.<P>

Matt Keye <BR>
Dove Canyon, California<P>

Is there a way to go faster than the speed of light?<P>

<B>Hi Matt,<BR>

As far as we know, nothing moves faster than the speed of light in a vacuum
(light moves more slowly in a medium like glass).  We do know that were
it possible to travel faster than the speed of light, then time travel would
also be possible.  So, perhaps the fact that we don't have tourists from
the 24th century popping in all the time means that mankind will never
find a way to make faster-than-light travel practical.<P>

Take care,<BR>
