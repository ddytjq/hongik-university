Much has been learned about stars by studying their infrared emission.
Infrared observations have led to the discovery of a large number of stars
which are too cool to be detected by their visible light or are hidden behind
obscuring dust.
Infrared observations have also led to the discovery of several stars which have
orbiting material.

Above is an image of infrared point sources in the entire sky as seen by the
Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS). The plane of our Galaxy runs
horizontally across the image. Sources are color coded by their
infrared colors. Blue sources are cool stars within our Galaxy, which
show an obvious concentration to the galactic plane and center.
Yellow-green sources are galaxies which are basically uniformly distributed
across the sky, but show an enhancement     
along a great circle above the galactic plane.
This enhancement is caused by galaxies in the Local Supercluster.
Reddish sources, the
infrared cirrus, are extremely cold material close to us in our own
Galaxy. Black areas were not surveyed by IRAS.

In 1997, the infrared camera on the Hubble Space Telescope (NICMOS) revealed
<a href="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/97/33.html">one of the 
brightest stars in our galaxy</a>.
This star, which is 10 million times more radiant than our Sun, was 
discovered in the center of our galaxy where it was hidden from visible
light telescopes by thick dust. In the image you can see two expanding 
shells of gas being ejected by the star in one of the largest stellar 
eruptions ever seen.

The image to the left shows
<a href="http://isi.ssl.berkeley.edu/wr104.html">
a "spiral" star which was discovered in the infrared.</a>
The star (Wolf-Rayet 104) is 3 times the size of our sun and 100,000 times
brighter.  Because it is so large and radiates so intensely, part of its
outer atmosphere is being blown off.  Wolf-Rayet 104 is a binary star system
- its companion is a smaller OB star.  The material being ejected from 
Wolf-Rayet 104 is swept into a spiral pattern by the stellar winds of both
stars.

One class of stars, the Mira variables,  emit most of their
radiation in the infrared.  
These are cool red giant stars which are about 700 times the diameter of
our sun and are the most numerous class of variable stars (stars with 
variable brightness).

Stars are often form in groups called star clusters.  The stars in a cluster
will usually move slowly away from each other as they age.  Many new star
clusters are still partially hidden by the dust and gas leftover from
star formation, making them more difficult to view in visible light.
Infrared light, however, can penetrate this dust and provide us with
a deeper view of the cluster.  The image to the right is an 
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap990921.html">infrared
view of the Quintuplet Star Cluster</a> which lies near the center of our
Milky Way Galaxy.  Since the center of our galaxy is a very dusty place, 
infrared observations are often the best way to view objects embedded in
and hidden by this dust.  This image taken with the NICMOS instrument on the
Hubble Space Telescope is the clearest view yet of this cluster.
