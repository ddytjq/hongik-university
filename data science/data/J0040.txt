Here's a couple pictures of the easy fill gas tank cover I made out of a 55 gallon drum and scrap hardware.
<br>
There's no need to remove the cover to fill the tank, just use the trap door.
<br>
I like to use ratching nylon straps to get the tank tied down tight.
<br>
Underneath the drum, the tank is wrapped in fiberglass insulation (the pink stuff)

Here's a picture of the stacks I made out of a stock exhaust manifold.
<br>
I welded a steel plate over the stock exhaust port.  I used my angle grinder to cut a 2" hole in the top 
<br>
of the stock exhaust manifold.  I shaped and welded on a 2.5" pipe.  My welding skills are kind of poor, 
<br>
so it took me several tries to get a good weld.  It leaked a little due to some burn though.
<br>
I tried putting JB Weld on it, but the stuff burned up.  I'm going to try some Permatex Copper silcone stuff next.

Here's a picture of my homemade leaf spring clamps I made out of 1/8" steel plate.  
<br>
Jack the car up on the bumper, so the wheels hang down.  Cutoff the stock clamps and bolt on the new ones.
<br>
This raises the car up and makes the rear suspension real solid.

Here's a couple pictures of how I'm using threaded rod on my 72 Imperial.
<br>
I have a bunch of 4"x6" steel plates that I use as washers in the back.
<br>
I have steel plates on the floor of the trunk, under the trunk lid and on top of the trunk too.

Before I got my new welder, I used wire to hold everything together.
<br>
Here's a couple shots of my wired up Mercury 
<p>

<p>
I am currently trying to wire up my 74 LTD wagon, using the stock electonic ignition.
<BR>
I think it would really be easier to use a points distributor and coil.
<p>

<p>
<p>
Here's a picture of my easily removable toggle switch setup.  It just sits on the passenger seat.  
<br>
All the wires are about a foot long and have sodderless connectors on them.
<p>
The one in my 74 LTD wagon (not pictured), also has the starter solenoid and electronic ignition module on it.
<br>  
I also mounted a 2nd solenoid on it (not hooked up).  If the 1st one fails, 
<br>
I can easily move the wires to the 2nd one in the pits.
<p>
Also seen in the picture is my threaded rod shifter.  You can't see the bottom, though.
<br>
I removed all the linkage and drilled out the hole to fit my 3/8"  , 3' long piece of rod.  
<br>
Above and below the shift lever on the tranny are 2 nuts with a lock washer between them.
<br>
To make a handle on the other end, I wrapped a 4" bolt to the threaded rod using electric tape.
<br>
I still have to take an old piece of innertube, cut a slot in it and screw it to the hole in the floor.
