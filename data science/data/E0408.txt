Danger! Warning! Peligro! Achtung! Watch it!</h1></center>
When using prototyped subroutines, subroutine order (sometimes) counts.
This is especially true of hash and array arguments. When passing arguments
in subroutines prototyped certain ways, if the called subroutine is defined
after the call, a <b><i>very non-obvious</i></b> runtime error is generated.
<p>I have nothing against the language requiring the programmer to order
subroutines correctly (as long as he has some method of forward references
for recursion), but the error should be compile time and informative. This
error is not, and can lead to long and frustrating debugging sessions.
Until solved, it can even look intermittent.
<p>Once again, the problem is in the order of subroutine definition. As
a hash argument example, consider the following program:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF" >
<tr>
<td>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;

sub showHash(\%)
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; my(%hashh) = %{(shift)};
&nbsp; my($temp);
&nbsp; foreach $temp (keys(%hashh)) { print "$temp=" . $hashh{$temp} . "\n"; }
&nbsp; print "\n";
&nbsp; }

sub higherLevel(\%)
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; my(%hashh) = %{(shift)};
&nbsp; showHash(%hashh);
&nbsp; }

my(%hashh) = ("1"=>"one","2"=>"two","3"=>"three");
higherLevel(%hashh);&nbsp;&nbsp;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In the preceding program, every call is to a previously defined function,
so everything works. Running this problem (assume it's called jj) yields
the expected output, as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC" >
<tr>
<td>
<pre>[slitt@mydesk slitt]$ ./jj
1=one
2=two
3=three

[slitt@mydesk slitt]$</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>But now make the simple change of moving subroutine higherLevel() above
subroutine showHash(), as shown in the listing that follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF" >
<tr>
<td>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;

sub higherLevel(\%)
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; my(%hashh) = %{(shift)};
&nbsp; showHash(%hashh);
&nbsp; }

sub showHash(\%)
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; my(%hashh) = %{(shift)};
&nbsp; my($temp);
&nbsp; foreach $temp (keys(%hashh)) { print "$temp=" . $hashh{$temp} . "\n"; }
&nbsp; print "\n";
&nbsp; }

my(%hashh) = ("1"=>"one","2"=>"two","3"=>"three");
higherLevel(%hashh);</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Running the preceding code yields the following non-obvious error:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC" >
<tr>
<td>
<pre>[slitt@mydesk slitt]$ ./jj
Can't use string ("1") as a HASH ref while "strict refs" in use at ./jj line 13.
[slitt@mydesk slitt]$&nbsp;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>As you can see, the program somehow thinks that %{(shift)} is delivering
the first key of the hash, instead of the hash itself. An odd outcome to
be produced by a simple change of subroutine order.
<p><b>ALWAYS BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THIS!</b> Although it looks simple enough
here, when occurring in a large program, especially when subroutines have
both hash args and array args, this can be *extremely* non-obvious. It
took an effort to synthesize this error into a 20 line program.
<p>This looks obvious in this 20 line program, but it's VERY CRYPTIC in
a large program, especially with multiple args like myFunction(\%\@$).
Unless you're aware of this, it can take hours to track down in a large
program. Even more misleading is the fact that if you have the functions
defined after calls to them, you can "fix" the problem by backslashing
the args in the call. However, if you then move the calls with backslashed
args below the subroutine definitions, that will cause an error. The whole
thing looks very intermittent unless you understand the role of definition
order. Watch out!
<p>Whenever an error message seems to say you're dealing with an element
of an array or hash when you know it to be the hash or array (or more correctly,
a reference to the hash or array), ascertain correct subroutine definition.
You can save hours.

The following shows a similar problem when passing arrays, starting with
the correct code:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF" >
<tr>
<td>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;

sub showArray(\@)
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; my(@arr) = @{(shift)};
&nbsp; my($temp);
&nbsp; foreach $temp (@arr) { print "$temp\n"; }
&nbsp; }

sub higherLevel(\@)
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; my(@arr) = @{(shift)};
&nbsp; showArray(@arr);
&nbsp; }

my(@arr) = ("one","two","three");
higherLevel(@arr);</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>As you can see, the preceding code calls already defined subroutines
and yields the following output, as expected:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC" >
<tr>
<td>
<pre>[slitt@mydesk slitt]$ ./jj
one
two
three
[slitt@mydesk slitt]$</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>But now place higherLevel() above showArray(), as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF" >
<tr>
<td>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;

sub higherLevel(\@)
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; my(@arr) = @{(shift)};
&nbsp; showArray(@arr);
&nbsp; }

sub showArray(\@)
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; my(@arr) = @{(shift)};
&nbsp; my($temp);
&nbsp; foreach $temp (@arr) { print "$temp\n"; }
&nbsp; }

my(@arr) = ("one","two","three");
higherLevel(@arr);</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The preceding code involves a call to an as of yet undefined subroutine,
and results in the extremely non-obvious error message shown following:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC" >
<tr>
<td>
<pre>[slitt@mydesk slitt]$ ./jj
Can't use string ("one") as an ARRAY ref while "strict refs" in use at ./jj line
&nbsp;13.
[slitt@mydesk slitt]$</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b>ALWAYS BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THIS!</b>. To repeat, it looks obvious
in this 20 line program, but it's VERY CRYPTIC in a large program, especially
with multiple args like myFunction(\%\@$). Unless you're aware of this,
it can take hours to track down in a large program. Even more misleading
