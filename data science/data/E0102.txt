      <p><strong>10/19</strong> -- Released version 2.0.1 of the BGui library, 
        with 2 new operating systems offically supported, and a bugfix.<br>
        <strong>10/18</strong> -- Released the WIP fixed version of BGui. Read 
        the <a

href="bgui2/index.htm">BGui page</a> for more details.<br>
        <strong>7/30</strong> -- I added 2 of my Java programs to <a

href="java/index.htm">The Coffee Cup section</a>. Enjoy.<br>
        <strong>7/23</strong> -- I've done a lot of editing now and have redesigned 
        some areas and created 2 others -- <a href="games.htm">The Games Corner</a> 
        and <a

href="java/index.htm">The Coffee Cup</a>. Check them out and <a href="contact.htm">let 
        me know</a> what you think.<br>
        <strong>7/9</strong> -- I edited he Allegro tutorial to be constistant 
        with the latest WIP. I also added a small sample Allegro program pre the 
        request of one of my visitors and a section for using Allegro with MSVC.<br>
        <strong>7/3</strong> -- I haven't updated in a long time. Anyways, I fixed 
        an error in the C tutorial in the structures section where a string should 
        have been copied using the strcpy command and not the = operator. Also 
        I fixed some things in the mini-dictionary. As for my &quot;secret project&quot; 
        I haven't worked on it since I left college in May, although I have ever 
        intention on finishing it, espically since I have most of it completed 
        now.<br>
        <strong>4/23</strong> -- Sorry guys but the site that hosted my voting 
        link decided to discontinue its Top 50 list because it was not getting 
        as many members as they wanted. Thanks for all of you who voted for me 
        to keep me #1 for so long, although there was not much competition :)! 
        As for the new game, I have been working on it. It is called Itana and 
        will be multi-player only (I will add bots if I have time and skill to 
        do that). I have most of the basic code in and I can virtually play the 
        whole game, but at the moment only by myself. My next steps are to add 
        in the networking foundation, then finish off the very last parts of the 
        engine, then it will enter beta stage where I will tweak it and stuff.</p>
      <p>Unlike my other projects I have decided to keep this one a lot more quiet 
        because I wanted to focus totally on making this one rather than getting 
        it out like I did to JetFight and PV2143. I actually want to FINISH this 
        game, and not have the problems I did with the other two games where my 
        teams lost interest (I as well to some extent), so I planned this game 
        where I could finish it by myself in one or two months and still be an 
        improvement over my last work. So far it has been going excelently -- 
        in fact better than I've expected! When I get it to beta stage (100% all 
        features and fully playable, only needs &quot;tweaking&quot; and final 
        bug fixing) I will release it at that time, which I expect to be before 
        I leave college at the end of May. After which time I might have trouble 
        testing network since I won't have the networking capabilities I have 
        here at college.</p>
      <p><strong>3/25</strong> -- I've been working on a new game recently but 
        I don't want any pressure on this or spending a lot of time with the web 
        page and all that so I can focus on the game and school, so I have been 
        quiet about it publically. But I was trying to decide wether to choose 
        floats, doubles, or fixeds in my program, so I did a lil' profiling. I 
        updated the <a

href="filesandprog.htm">Archive</a> with this new info.<br>
        <strong>3/8</strong> -- I have returned from spring break! There have 
        been some new updates to the site. The contact form works again, the random 
        number library has been updated to fix some major bugs and I just updated 
        the MUUDPIC site (I know it's been done for awhile, sorry for not getting 
        around to updating.) Also I have been having counter troubles for the 
        last month along with all of the other users on the site. It will be cleared 
        up soon otherwise I will be changing counters. I've lost about 400 hits 
        and I cannot access the stats or usage reports since their program times 
        out.<br>
        <strong>2/20</strong> -- I've updated the poll and added a link to a C/C++ 
        oriented newsletter, Codecraft. It's listed near the top of the links 
        page, or you can follow the link <a

href="http://www.cyberelectric.net.au/~collins/">here</a>. Also work on MUUDPIC 
        has resumed! Actually it started about a week ago but now it is nearly 
        finished. Just tonight I finished the working version with all of the 
        features working correctly. I just need to add a few additional things 
        to make it more stable in case people get disconnected from the internet 
        or try to use duplicate names. I will update the page soon.<br>
        <strong>2/10</strong> -- The COMPLETE version of DeathWorms is out now! 
        Sorry for the delay but it didn't get worked on as we all got busy. But 
        now it's out, check it out <a href="deathworms/index.htm">here</a>.<br>
        <strong>1/29</strong> -- I updated the jrnd library so now it will work 
        in both C and C++ on all ANSI standard compilers, and now it has its own 
        RNG so you will get the same performance on all platforms. As for the 
        new &quot;mystery game&quot; I hope to have it out by the end of this 
        weekend. Its webpage here is complete, the GUI just needs a few finishing 
        touches and the save/load code is nearly complete.<br>
        <strong>1/27</strong> -- The voting link to Armageddon Games is finnally 
        back up! Thanks to all of the people who have voted for my site in the 
        past. There should also be a total revamp of the jrnd library which will 
        be portable across ANY COMPILER (not just DJGPP). Expect this by the end 
        of the week. The GUI frontend on the &quot;mystery game&quot; is very 
        near completion.<br>
        <strong>1/24</strong> -- Sorry I have not done much in the tutorial area 
        but instead I had been working on programming a new little game that we 
        have been playing around with in the dorms for hours. The only downside 
        is that it's only fun with 3-4 people so it IS multiplayer! I've had it 
        done for a bit but now I am going to put a GUI frontend to it so other 
        people can reasonably use it too. It supports as many players as you can 
        fit on one keyboard and up to 4 joysticks!!! Look for it soon.<br>
        As for the OOP tutorial I've uploaded the 4 sections that I've done since 
        the last update. Also I found a memory leak bug in the LinkList library 
        and it has been fixed now and cleaned up some. I'm also on the DJGPP ring 
        now so feel free to browse the sites along the ring for more DJGPP information.<br>
        <strong>1/17</strong> -- I've done some misc work on the site making sure 
        The Archive, the Learning section, and the dictionary are all up to date. 
        I have also started up work on the OOP tutorial again because of a request 
        ;). Anyways the fifth chapter is now finished totally and I have just 
        started on the sixth chapter.<br>
        <strong>1/14</strong> -- Updated the links page, made sure the descriptions 
        were still valid and all of the links pointed to the right places, and 
        deleted obsolete links.<strong><br>
        1/12</strong> -- Sorry for not updating in a long time. I had been waiting 
        to see if I could fix the problems with the Windows PV2143 or not before 
        I released it. Either ways I've decided to release the Windows version, 
        although it still have a few bugs but at least I know they are Allegro's 
        now. When Allegro (the library I use to do grfx, sfx, etc) gets finalized 
        hopefully it will look and act exactly with the DOS PV2143.<br>
        BTW: I just notced that Fortunecities is getting stupider and stupider. 
        I'm so glad I left them. I just noticed they have a file download gateway 
        for every file you get that puts up banners and shameless FC ads!!! I 
        almost feel stupid mirroring them now they are so lame... but RIT goes 
        down every once in awhile...<font

        </strong></font><strong>12/11</strong> -- I changed the poll. It was starting 
        to get old after a few months ;).<br>
        <strong>12/10</strong> -- Sorry for being out of the scene for so long. 
        A few weeks ago I got MSVC and have been playing around with it, with 
        the intentions of porting the PV2143 game to Windows DirectX using the 
        new Allegro which is almost complete. The program runs somewhat but there 
        are still serious bugs and progress is slow. When I get around to it I 
        will probably MSVC-ize the site and tutorials, making sure what is DJGPP 
        specific is mentioned as being specific to DJGPP. I will also consider 
        making a short tutorial about some basic MSVC things helpful for programmers 
        starting with the environment or starting the C/C++ tutorial.<br>
        <strong>11/8</strong> -- I put an .a library file in the QuickGUI zip 
        for those who don't want to have to bother with compiling it. It's only 
        6k after zipped so it's no biggie.<br>
        <strong>11/7</strong> -- If you are reading this, you know that the page 
        has moved to the RIT server! It was a hard decision but I decided to make 
        it because in the long run it will do better than fortunecities.<br>
        <strong>11/4</strong> -- Sorry for not having many updates lately but 
        it's because I've been busy with end-of-term stuff in college. Very soon 
        I think I may have a lot more time opening up! I've also added a link 
        to the Armegeddon Games Programming Top 50 to vote for my site. If you 
        liked my site I appreciate your vote!<br>
        <strong>10/30</strong> -- Sorry I messed up permissions on the one-part 
        PV2143 download yesterday! It should be working now. Thanks goes out to 
        Zylot for finding this problem!!!<br>
        <strong>10/25</strong> -- I've released QuickGUI under the <a

href="filesandprog.htm">Files and Programming page</a>. There was also an update 
        to the library that MUUDPIC uses to access the TCP/IP stack in Windows 
        and it is working better but still fails on all computers. When the library 
        improves enough or I get access to Linux or MSVC work will continue.<br>
        <strong>10/21</strong> -- I've put up an <strong>UNOFFICAL</strong> release 
        of the JPEG library by Eric Vannier because the offical site has been 
        gone for MONTHS and the other links to get it at are broken. Get this 
        from the <a href="filesandprog.htm">Files and Programming page</a>. As 
        for QGUI, I should probably release that, and I will soon, but the reason 
        why I hadn't was because I wanted to get it to work on Linux. Well I couldn't 
        get the thing to work on my system because it doesn't recognize my hard 
        drive, and x windows is horribly slow and there is hardly any support 
        for things in my system. The only good thing I can say about it is that 
        networking over my ethernet and all of the essential things were all there 
        when I started and ready for use and even setup correctly -- something 
        Windows never did. So if I ever get Linux to work it is very doubtful 
        I will EVER develop anything in or to Linux.<br>
        <strong>10/15</strong> -- The conversion of MUUDPIC/TextGUI to Allegro 
        is well underway. The base GUI procedures are ready to be used, and I 
        will release it separately from MUUDPIC for those who want to use it. 
        The textbox from TextGUI still exists, allowing for real-time window output 
        in the GUI using the &lt;&lt; operator (like cout), and there is a QInput 
        class which can grab input quickly from the user using the &gt;&gt; operator 
        (like cin), with the option of giving the user a prompt, settable via 
        a method. So far there are two misc tools, a wrapper for the editbox to 
        work well with enter, sending a MSG_TEXTBOX to all objects, and a QOutput 
        to quickly display a message to the user. I plan to release source which 
        will compile under both Linux and DOS without changes if at all possible, 
        but there will be two ports.<br>
        <strong>10/12</strong> -- Because of my lack of success in UNIX curses, 
        I am writing MUUDPIC using GUI powered by Allegro, the library I use for 
        my JetFight and PV2143 games, and which is also (supposedly directly) 
        portable to Linux, which I intend to do after I get the GUI working in 
        DOS (the internet library still does not work under 98), using classes 
        as similar as possible to TextGUI classes (most of those functions are 
        obsolete now, including CTextBox, which is 100% obsolete in the GUI since 
        a textbox already exists).<br>
        <strong>10/11</strong> -- The Linux port of MUUDPIC has been released. 
        It would be totally completed except for some curses stuff. Actually my 
        opinion of ncurses is not too great right now, and if anyone would please 
        help, I would appreciate it. I spent 5 minutes (quite literally) porting 
        my logic to Linux, and I've spent over 10-15 hours+ porting only 50 lines 
        of code! Curses seems impossible! For some reason, it doesn't show right 
        on VT100, crashes an xterm, corrupts the screen in ANSI, but corrupts 
        it just slightly less in ANSI.SYS mode. What a wonderful piece of crap.<br>
        <strong>10/6</strong> -- It's PV2143, it's back, and it's better than 
        ever in version 15, with many map editor enhancements and some game enhancements! 
        Check the <a href="files/readme.txt">PV2143 readme file</a> for the latest 
        info. If you want to be on the mailing list to know when new PV2143 news

      <h2><a name="game"></a>Old Project V2143 News:</h2>
      <p>6/7--Build 12 is out with the following features: Digital MOD music, 
        collision detection, loading maps from last build and this one (saves 
        only latest version since it converts). Road and bridge graphics, and 
        now buildings! I have to admit they are not all that great because of 
        their drawing angle but this WILL be fixed (looks at unit artist).<br>
        5/31--So far for build 12 I have some buildings in and digital MOD music. 
        This next version will also be able to read maps both from the previous 
        build 11 and from its own version; however, it will only save maps of 
        its version (for conversion purposes.) I'm also thinking of doing the 
        same thing in the future.<br>
        5/25--Many additions to the editor, including intelligent tile laying, 
        &quot;big fonts&quot; and in general more helpful, intelligent, and context-sensitve 
        menus. The stealth tank and the trees have a new look, as well as the 
        player tank (Earth tank)'s cannon. Also the new map format makes the maps 
        only 1/3rd of their original size, and MUCH MUCH faster loading/saving.<br>
        5/21--All of the previously mentioned features have been added, which 
        is way too many to list again. This is the very first build I actually 
        started considering this a real &quot;game&quot; now rather than just 
        a programming project. Also, if you would like to be added on the mailing 
        list for this game, when I release a new version on the site I will notify 
        you. To be added send me <a href="contact.htm">mail</a> stating wether 
        you wish to subscribe or unsubcribe. Your email address of course will 
        not leave the list, and fall into the evil hands of junk advertisers ;).<br>
        5/17--I've gotten the <strong>ALL</strong> of the terrain tiles in besides 
        some road and the bridges. The next release should come out by this weekend, 
        and should be the biggest yet!<br>
        5/16--Sorry for the lack of updates recently but last Thursday I graduated 
        and partied all night ;). Since then I've been enjoying a wonderful weeked 
        off school! Since the last release, I've been working on the AI, and adding 
        more enemies, and the new, morphing, player tank now. Right now even before 
        a lot of the AI is in I can't even beat 4 tanks now at a time! By the 
        next release I should have greated added to the editor (to allow for AI 
        editing) and added some more enemies, and perhaps the rest of the tiles 
        (my artist says he'll work on them today.)<br>
        5/9--A small update. Added water gibs and a flood fill option in the map 
        editor (select F to use.) The instructions pops up a real GUI box now 
        besides the raw lines of text, which make it easier to read and much easier 
        for me to maintain. Unfortunately no other major features have or will 
        be implemented until I get more art/music/sfx :(.<br>
        5/4--Added previously mentioned features, and more tile arts. Also a new
