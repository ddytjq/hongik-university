<P>
Cosmologists work to better understand the contents, structure,
and evolution of the universe over vast stretches of space and
time and over enormous ranges of density, temperature, and energy.
Theorists, observers, and experimenters use a diverse assortment
of techniques and instruments to answer questions of the most
fundamental kind. Progress over the past three decades, but especially
since the maturing of space science, has been astonishing. Recent
observational results from the COBE satellite have revolutionized
how cosmologists think about structure in the universe, and current
efforts to map the fluctuations in the CMBR on smaller angular
scales promise to show us details of the thermal history of the
universe and to measure its fundamental parameters. Observations
of large-scale structure in the universe as measured by the galaxy
distribution have made dramatic progress in recent years, challenging
all available theoretical models. Our knowledge of large-scale
flows is still incomplete, but, when the work is finished, cosmologists
will be much closer to understanding the role of dark matter in
the universe. The new generation of giant telescopes such as the
10-m Keck are making remarkable observations, and the Keck, along
with its newly constructed twin and the two 8-m Gemini telescopes,
will enable study of the distant universe in ways never before
conceivable. The HST has already made seminal contributions, including
a measurement of the Hubble constant that gives the universe a
surprisingly young age. We expect dramatic advances in our understanding
of galaxy and large-scale structure evolution, as well as new
tests of global curvature, to emerge from these studies in the
coming decade. We still have no clear idea of the nature of the
ubiquitous dark matter, but it is almost certainly a remnant of
the early universe. Several experiments are under way to detect,
or eliminate, candidates for this dark matter, and these will
make substantial progress in the coming decade.
<P>
The problems of cosmology are particularly well posed, but many
of the solutions have remained elusive for decades. At last, with
the accelerating influx of new data from numerous advanced experimental
and theoretical techniques, fundamental questions about the nature
of our physical world are beginning to be answered. Cosmologists
eagerly await the exciting new insights that will surely come
in the next decade. If another briefing on cosmology is written
10 years from now, it will undoubtedly bear little resemblance
to this one.<BR>
