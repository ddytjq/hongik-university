<h3><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>

Modern high-precision optical systems, such as space astrometric
interferometers (e.g. Reasenberg et al. 1996, Loiseau and Malbet 1996, 
Lindegren and Perryman 1996), can require optical path 
tolerances in the sub-nanometer (1 nm = 10<sup>-9</sup> m) to picometer
(1 pm = 10<sup>-12</sup> m) regimes over total path lengths on the
order 10 m.  Such tolerances place extreme requirements on optical analysis 
programs.  Two questions are of paramount importance:  1) to
which specific perturbations is a system most sensitive? and 2) are
there couplings between different perturbations that produce high
sensitivities (i.e., are there strong correlations between
perturbation parameters)?  AESOP can be, and has been 
(<a href="about_AESOP.html#refs">Murison, 1993</a>),
used to fully answer these questions, as well as to develop physical
intuition in the picometer OPD regime.
<p>

A common optical subsystem employed in astronomical 
interferometers is a <i>beam compressor</i>, used to convert a large aperture input 
beam (starlight) to a narrow output beam (~1 cm) suitable for
combining with another such beam to produce interference fringes of 
sufficient visibility.  A typical beam compressor consists
of a pair of confocal paraboloidal mirrors, as sketched in Figure 1.
If perfectly aligned, a flat input wavefront results in a radially
compressed flat output wavefront.  Misalignment analysis of even such
a simple system as this generally requires resorting to numerical
programs.  Usually, such programs are ill-suited for studies involving
both misalignment parameter variation and aperture-averaged optical path
difference (OPD) determination, especially in the pm regime.  The need for 
picometer OPD tolerances is a relatively recent development, driven by 
ever more demanding sciece objectives.  Such tolerance requirements will 
likely become more common, and the lack of adequate analysis tools will 
correspondingly be felt more strongly.
<p>
To develop a physical understanding of alignment sensitivities, one
would much prefer an <i>analytical</i> rather than a numerical
description of the output wavefront as a function of the misalignment
parameters.  Unfortunately, an analytical wavefront description of
misaligned optical systems as simple as a beam compressor, or even a
single focussing optic, can be too complex to attempt by hand in the
kind of detail required for sensitivity studies 
(<a href="about_AESOP.html#refs">Noecker et al. 1993</a>).
However, computer algebra systems such as Maple have advanced to such
a state of capability and sophistication that, coupled with the
processing power of modern computers, complete analytical descriptions
are now becoming possible.  
<p>
AESOP was developed to support the analysis effort involved in
determining critical sensitivities to optic misalignments in a proposed dual
interferometric astrometric telescope, 
<a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~reasen/points.html" target="_top">POINTS</a> 
(<a href="about_AESOP.html#refs">Reasenberg et al. 1988, 1995a, 1995b, 1996</a>).  
POINTS consists of a 
pair of independent Michelson stellar interferometers and a laser 
metrology system that measures both the critical starlight paths and the 
angle between the two interferometer baselines.  The nominal design has 
baselines of 2 m, telescope apertures of 35 cm, and observes target
stars separated by roughly 90 degrees.  One of the distinguishing
features of POINTS is that it employs holographic optical elements
(HOEs) to accomplish picometer metrology over the full aperture of the
starlight optical path.  See the Reasenberg et al. references for a
full description of the instrument, its capabilities, and the
astrophysical, astrometric, and planet-finding science that POINTS
would significantly impact. (Information can also be found on the
POINTS web pages at 
<a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~reasen/points.html" target="_top">
 http://www-cfa.harvard.edu/~reasen/points.html
</a>.)
<p>
A key analysis problem regarding the POINTS interferometers is the
determination of optical path length errors as a function of various
optical element misalignments. The path length error budget in a
precision system such as this is only several tens of picometers.
With such a tight error budget, it is imperative to determine which
perturbations lead to large path length errors.  At the pm
level, often we cannot trust our optical intuition in determining
misalignment sensitivities.  In such cases, we must rely on numerical 
analysis to an uncomfortable degree, lacking reliable independent
checks on the numerical results.  AESOP was created in part to fill this 
niche.  In the case of POINTS, a numerical
program called RayTrace (see <a href="about_AESOP.html#refs">Murison (1993)</a> 
for a description) was written specifically to perform ultra-high 
precision, sub-picometer OPD variation analyses.  AESOP was developed 
in parallel with RayTrace.  The two analysis approaches &#150; numerical 
and analytic &#150; are completely independent and therefore serve as 
excellent checks upon one another.  
<p>
AESOP traces an input ray through a misaligned optical system and
produces an analytic description of the output ray as a function of
the system parameters, the misalignment parameters, and the input ray
position and direction.  A crucial diagnostic is the <i>aperture-averaged</i>
OPD variation.  The physical principles involved are quite
simple, since AESOP takes a classical geometric optics approach.  At a
given reflecting surface, all that is required is to calculate the
reflected ray direction and the accumulated optical path up to that
intersection point.  Similarly, at a refracting surface we use Snell's
law to calculate the refracted ray direction.  If a holographic
optical element (HOE) is encountered, it is a similarly simple process
to calculate the output ray direction and the change in optical phase
across the element (<a href="about_AESOP.html#refs">Murison and Noecker, 1993</a>).  
The POINTS optical
subsystems involve all three types of optical surfaces.
AESOP currently handles reflecting and holographic optical elements.
Refracting surfaces will be easy to add, due to the extensible
structure of AESOP.
<p>
As simple as the physics is, such a ray tracing process is impossible to
do analytically by hand (especially the aperture-averaged effects).  The
inhibiting factor is the rapidly increasing (with
each successive optical surface) complexity of the
intermediate expressions that must be algebraically manipulated.  This
kind of repetitive manipulation of unwieldy objects is precisely what
computers can do well.  Hence, a programmable computer algebra system like
Maple is well suited in principle to analyzing misaligned optical
systems, at least simple ones involving relatively few focussing
optical surfaces.

<p>
An overview of the ray tracing process using AESOP is as follows.
<p>
(1) In a Maple procedure that the user writes, the user first defines
the various optical elements comprising the optical system.  These
surfaces are assembled into a Maple list which AESOP routines will
make use of.  Perturbations (misalignments) are applied in the form of
rotations and/or translations of specified optical elements.  AESOP
provides object rotation and translation procedures to make this a 
simple process.
<p>
(2) The user then defines the input ray, which is subsequently
launched into the optical system by calling the AESOP procedure
<b>raytrace()</b>.  AESOP then
automatically traces the ray to each successive optical element,
performing series expansions on the perturbation parameter(s) as
necessary and simplifying the cumbersome expressions as as much as
possible, until finally an output ray is produced at the detector.
Progress during this process is communicated via informational
messages and key intermediate expressions to the monitor screen.  If
nothing else, there is plenty of stuff the user can peruse while
waiting for the ray trace to finish, since AESOP is intentionally a
bit chatty.
<p>
(3) The OPD is then calculated from the output ray expressions,
followed by calculation of the aperture-averaged OPD.
<p>

<img src="graphics/WavefrontExample.gif" align=right width=300 height=256 border=1>

(4) Optionally, the Zernike components of the OPD are determined next,
either at the Maple prompt or from within the user's driver procedure.
The resulting Zernike coefficients may then be combined to produce
wavefront aberration plots.  The aberrated wavefronts are represented
by 3D Maple surface plots.  Maple procedures are supplied for making
the wavefront plots in the Maple worksheet.
<p>
Two illustrative examples of this entire process for a simple beam
compressor are shown 
<img src="graphics/PDFsmall.gif" alt="PDF logo" width=15 height=16 border=0>
<a href="Examples/BeamCompExample.pdf">here</a> 
and 
<img src="graphics/PDFsmall.gif" alt="PDF logo" width=15 height=16 border=0>
<a href="Papers/MTN/AESOP_article.pdf">here</a>.
<p>
In practice, the essential step for useful analytical ray
tracing is to make series expansions at each intersection of a ray
with an optical surface.  (The original insight for this trick is due
to R.D. Reasenberg.)  This reduces the "equation bloat" considerably.
Even so, it is still rather easy to cause the intermediate expressions
to mushroom in size so that they overwhelm the available machine
resources.  The equation bloat seems to go as some power of the number of
focussing optical elements in a system.  Flat surfaces certainly
contribute to increasing equation complexity, but at a rate that pales
in comparison to that of focussing surfaces.
<p>
Since we are interested in analyzing optical systems whose elements
are slightly misaligned, the small parameters to perform the series
expansion on are naturally the misalignment perturbations.  Hence,
AESOP is not meant to analyze the very interesting properties of
ideal, perfectly aligned optical systems.  It requires at least one
misalignment or other perturbation parameter.
<p>
For a given optical system, a certain amount (sometimes a great
amount) of tinkering on the part of the user is required to hit upon
the best ways of simplifying the cumbersome expressions so that their
size is managable.  Great care has been made in the types of
simplification taking place in the AESOP ray tracing routines.
However, they are no doubt optimized for the particular systems the
author has analyzed and will therefore perhaps be less than
optimum for other kinds of optical systems.  Hence, AESOP is
nowhere near the "black box" stage, where a user can provide necessary
input, crank the handle, and magically produce an answer without
caring overmuch about the internals of the black box.  Nonetheless,
AESOP can be quite useful and represents a significant
advance in capability for analyzing perturbed optical systems and
performing misalignment sensitivity studies.  It also serves as an
invaluable check on numerical programs as well as an essential aid to
developing reliable insight into the arcane and beautiful world of
high-precision optics.
