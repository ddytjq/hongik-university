      of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, Blumberg posed a challenge
      to the scientific community.<BR>
<BR>
      &quot;The mission is to look for life without any specifications.
      Nothing in the mission would preclude looking for rather strange
      and unusual life forms that we can't even imagine right now,&quot;
      said Blumberg.</P>

      <P>NASA Administrator Dan Goldin concurred, stating, &quot;We're
      looking for any form of biological life. Single-cell (organisms)
      would be a grand slam.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
      In order to effectively search for life on other planets, we
      first have to come to an understanding about what life IS. One
      way to do this is to study the forms that life can take.

    <!--/NOEDIT-->In his 1917 work, &quot;On Growth and Form,&quot;
      D'Arcy Thompson altered mathematical functions in order to visualize
      how species changed shape over time. <BR>
<BR>
      NASA scientists are using Thompson's biomathematical studies
      of life forms on Earth to postulate about life forms throughout
      the universe. There are certain universal conditions that will
      always affect the shape of a life form, wherever that life may

      of matter, and it is in obedience to the laws of physics that
      their particles have been moved, moulded and conformed.&quot;<BR>

      <P>But before we can conduct a comprehensive search for unknown
      extraterrestrial forms of life, there needs to be an extensive
      classification of known life forms on Earth. The history of life
      on Earth provides us with a good model for how life can evolve
      in the universe. Fossils, even microbial fossils, can tell us
      a great deal about all the different life forms that have at
      one time or another shown their face on our planet.<BR>
<BR>
      &quot;Some fossils in the ancient Burgess shale are so alien
      we can't determine which end of the creatures are up, and yet
      these monsters evolved right here on Earth from the same origins
      that we did,&quot; wrote Johan Forsberg, a Swedish psychologist.</P>

      <P>By becoming forensic scientists, researchers at the Space
      Sciences Laboratory at the Marshall Space Flight Center can develop
      an encyclopedia of microbial life forms that have developed on
      Earth. Because so many life forms need to be catalogued, the
      scientists are working to develop a &quot;D'Arcy Machine&quot;
      to help them create a comprehensive &quot;Book of Life.&quot;

      <P>This Book of Life project has three phases. Phase 1 - compiling
      a beginning database of microbial life forms - has already been
      completed. This image database is composed of 10,000 examples
      and distinguishes the basic microbial shapes such as rods, spheres,
      filaments, clusters that look like grapes (<IMG SRC="images/BOL/bacteria.gif"
      WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="133" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">cocci),
      and spirochete (spirals). A computer neural network has been
      trained to recognize and classify these microbial life forms
      with 90 percent accuracy.<BR>

      <P>Phase 2 of the project will expand the basic database by using
      a more powerful neural network. Funds from the NASA Advanced
      Concepts Office provided Marshall scientists with a Beowulf-class
      parallel computer. NASA developed the Beowulf Project to address
      scientific problems associated with large data sets. <BR>

      Scientists at Marshall have named the new parallel computer &quot;Leibniz,&quot;
      after the German mathematician whose lifelong goal was to organize
      all human knowledge. This computer system will expand the image
      database by acquiring and classifying new and ambiguous images.
      To discriminate organic life forms from inorganic shapes, microbiologists
      often use the vague criteria, &quot;Does it look alive to you?&quot;
      A parallel computer using pattern recognition can make this task
      easier and more exact by breaking the starting image down into
      identifiable parts.</P>

      <P>&quot;Human judgement is still very much depended upon for
      identifying microbial life forms,&quot; says Dr. David Noever
      of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. &quot;Automated filters
      would be much like the filters commonly used to sort out useful
      e-mails from useless ones. The user of the neural network would
      get a morning menu of microbial candidates for further detective
      work.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
      Although the trained human eye is better at recognizing microbial
      life forms, using a computer &quot;filter&quot; to check for
      life-like patterns could help cut the immense scale of the Book
      of Life project down to a more manageable size. <BR>

            to a skeleton representation, the basic templates for classifying
            microbial shapes can still discriminate enough to give identifications.
            These images were included in the paper, &quot;Microbial Morphometry:

      By Phase 3 of the project, the neural network will be so advanced
      in its learning that it will be able to acquire and classify
      new images with minimal human supervision. This network would
      then be equipped for future search scenarios, including the examination
      of meteorites found on Earth and samples retrieved from lunar
      or interplanetary space missions. This advanced neural network
      will be a fast and efficient classifier of the vast amount of
      microbial images that will need to catalogued.

      This speed and efficiency are extremely important due to the
      detail with which the samples must be analyzed. Not only are
      there a lot of samples to study, but there are multiple dimensions
      to consider. D'Arcy Thompson used mostly linear and quadratic
      maps to compare different life forms. Linear maps between two
      shapes require four coefficient variables, while quadratic maps
      use 10 variables.<BR>
<BR>
      Thompson wrote in &quot;On Growth and Form,&quot; &quot;I know
      that in the study of material things number, order, and position
      are the threefold clue to exact knowledge: and that these three,
      in the mathematician's hands, furnish the first outlines for
      a sketch of the Universe.&quot;<BR>

      <P>While Thompson and other biomathematicians used almost exclusively
      linear and quadratic distortions to study how life forms change
      over time, it is unlikely that complex life forms throughout
      the universe will be confined to these narrow statistical relationships.
      In a paper presented last September at the 50th anniversary D'Arcy
      Thompson conference in Dundee, Scotland, Noever asked, &quot;What
      if D'Arcy had had a computer?&quot;</P>

      <P>When D'Arcy Thompson introduced the idea of studying organisms
      by their geometric shapes, he could only draw figures by hand.
      The computers of today can take Thompson's research much further.
      By repeatedly comparing and contrasting learnable imagery, a
      D'Arcy machine would expand the chapters of the Book of Life
      Project and give us an interplanetary version of D'Arcy Thompson's
      classic &quot;On Growth and Form.&quot;<IMG SRC="images/BOL/Astronaut.jpg"
      WIDTH="114" HEIGHT="300" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

      <P>Computers with artificial intelligence using neural networks
      provide more opportunities to answer complex astrobiology imaging
      questions. The non-linear evolution of artificial intelligence
      is customized to handle the learning of multiple patterns or
      images. Computers with artificial intelligence could accommodate
      various influencing variables (such as gravity) that change over
      scales much larger than a linear variance can include. Changes
      in the effects of gravity on a body can occur, for instance,
      when humans go into outer space. Astronauts often experience
      fluid retention, excessive bone loss and muscle wasting due to
      the effects of microgravity.<BR>

      Linneham works out to combat the effects of microgravity onboard

      <P>The neural network at Marshall will be able to rapidly process
      the complex computations necessary for mathematically analyzing
      the shapes of life (morphometrics). If someone continuously used
      a hand calculator to tabulate just linear connections, at a rate
      of one calculation per second it would take forty years to finish
      a billion calculations. The Linux-based computer at Marshall
      speeds up this process dramatically, processing over a billion
      connections per second.

      </TABLE>Life is not an easy thing to define. Even now, we're
      finding life forms on Earth that we never before thought possible.
      Extremeophiles (bacteria that live in extreme environments) have
      recently been found living in hydrothermal vents and in high
      salt environments - areas once thought to be completely inhospitable
      to life. In 1997, Stephen Zinder of Cornell University discovered
      the existence of bacteria that thrive in the harsh solvents perchloroethylene
      and trichloroethylene that are used to clean machine parts. An
      acid-loving bacteria, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, can live under
      conditions that would dissolve human skin in seconds.</P>
