        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="3">
        Deamidation of asparagine residues is one of the most common post-translational
          modifications occurring in therapeutic proteins produced using
          recombinant DNA technology.&nbsp; A reduction/loss of in vitro or in vivo biological activity has been
          reported for a variety of proteins including recombinant human DNAse (Cacia
          et al., J. Chromatogr. 1993, 634:229-239) and recombinant soluble CD4
          (Teshima et al., Biochemistry 1991, 30:3916-3922) while others appear
          unaffected (recombinant human growth hormone; hGH); Becker et al.,
          Biotech. Appl. Biochem, 1988, 10:326-337).&nbsp; It is therefore important to establish methods for characterizing the
          sites of deamidation as well as for evaluating the effect on
          biological activity and antigenicity.</font></p>

        <h3>What is deamidation?</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Deamidation is a common post-translational modification resulting in
          the conversion of an asparagine residue to a mixture of isoaspartate
          and aspartate.&nbsp; Deamidation of glutamine residues can occur but does so at a much
          lower rate.</p>

          protein degradation thereby regulating intracellular levels.</p>

        <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <h4>Neutral pH (Beta-aspartyl shift mechanism)</h4>
        <p>The non-enzymatic modification of asparagine and aspartate residues
        at physiological pH occurs primarily through intramolecular
        rearrangement as shown in <a href="deamidation.htm" target="_blank">Figure
        1</a>.</p>
        <p>Step 1</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The peptide bond nitrogen (reactive anion) of the N + 1 amino acid
          attacks the carbonyl carbon of the asparagine or aspartate side chain
          forming a five-membered ring structure referred to as a succinimide or
          cyclic imide.</p>
        </blockquote>
          <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
        <p>Step 2</p>
        </font>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="3">The succinimide is then rapidly hydrolyzed at either the alpha or
          beta carbonyl group to yield iso-aspartate (beta-aspartate) and
          aspartate in a ratio of approximately 3:1.</font></p>

        Acidic pH

          <p><font size="3">At low pH (&lt;2), direct hydrolysis of the side chain amide
          generates aspartate as the sole product.</font></p>

        Sequence considerations

          <blockquote>
            <p>Highest frequency in proteins with Asn-Gly sequences</p>
            <p>For proteins in which deamidation has been established and the
            site characterized, <u>glycine </u>has far and away been the most
            common (N + 1) neighboring residue.</p>
          <p>Intermediate frequency in Asn residues followed by a polar amino
          acid with a relatively small side chain (i.e. Ser, Thr, Asp).&nbsp;
          Low frequency in Asn residues followed by a hydrophobic amino acid
          with a bulky side chain.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><b>Explanation for different rates of reactivity</b></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Steric hindrance by the bulky side chain of the N + 1 amino acid
            may limit accessibility of the reactive nitrogen anion to the
            asparagine side chain amide thereby reducing the rate of reactivity.</p>

        <h4><font SIZE="3">
        Conformational effects
        </font></h4>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The asparagine and flanking regions must be solvent accessible and
          reside within a conformationally flexible region of the molecule.&nbsp;
          Crystal structure data, if available,
          allows the most complete assessment of local conformational
          flexibility and exposure of amino acid residues and used in
          conjunction with primary sequence information should provide the most
          accurate prediction of deamidation.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h4>Exposure to alkaline pH</h4>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Exposure to alkaline pH results in an increased rate of succinimide
          formation due to greater deprotonation of the peptide bond nitrogen at
          higher pH values.</p>

          detect, incubation of protein samples in slightly alkaline buffer
          (i.e. 20mM sodium phosphate, pH ~ 8) or at elevated temperature (i.e.

          <h4>Correlation with location relative to binding site</h4>
        <blockquote>
          <p>There appears to be a relationship between the location of the
          deamidation site relative to the receptor binding region as it affects
          biological activity for hGH and CD4.&nbsp; Deamidation
          at Asn52-Asp53 of CD4 reduced the in vitro biological activity while
          deamidation at Asn149-Ser150 of hGH had no apparent effect.&nbsp; These results are consistent with the
          location of the sites of deamidation in relation to the binding
          region(s).&nbsp; In the case of
          CD4, Asn52 is located in a region of the molecule involved in binding
          to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), while for hGH, Asn149
          resides outside the two receptor binding regions.</p>

          <p>
        While knowledge of the binding sites can be useful in predicting
          the effect of deamidation on biological activity at a particular site,
          the final determination must be made from the results of human
          clinical trials.
