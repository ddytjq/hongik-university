Until a few hundred years ago, the Solar System and the Universe were
equivalent in the minds of scientists, so the discovery that the Earth
is <A HREF="./solar_system.html">not the center</A> of the Solar System
was an important step in the development of cosmology.
Early in the 20th century Shapley established that the Solar System is
<A HREF="./milkyway.html">far from the center</A> of the Milky Way.
So by the 1920's, the stage was set for the critical observational
discoveries that led to the Big Bang model of the Universe.

In 1929
<A HREF="http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Hubble.html">
Hubble </A>
[<A HREF="http://www.stsci.edu/proof/edwin.html">1</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.time.com/time/time100/scientist/profile/hubble.html">2</A>,
<A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/diamond_jubilee/d_1996/hubble_nas.html">
3</A>]
published a
<A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/diamond_jubilee/d_1996/hub_1929.html">
claim</A> that the <EM>radial velocities</EM> of
galaxies are proportional to their distance.  The redshift of a galaxy is a
measure of its radial velocity, and it can be measured using a spectrograph
to determine the <A HREF="./doppler.htm">Doppler shift</A>.
The plot below shows Hubble's 1929 data:
<BR><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="./hub_1929.gif" WIDTH=486 HEIGHT=471 ALT="Hubble's data">
</CENTER><BR>
The slope of the fitted line is 464 km/sec/Mpc, and is now known 
as the Hubble constant, H<SUB>o</SUB>.  [Sometimes I will use "TeX" mode,
so A_x means
that x is a subscript, A<SUB>x</SUB>,
while A^x means that x is a superscript, A<SUP>x</SUP>.]
Since both kilometers and Megaparsecs (1 Mpc = 3.086E24 cm
[the "E24" means multiply the 3.086 by 10 to the 24th power]) are
units of distance, the simplified units of H<SUB>o</SUB> are 1/time,
and the conversion is given by
<PRE>
1/H<SUB>o</SUB> = (978 Gyr)/(H<SUB>o</SUB> in km/sec/Mpc)
</PRE>
Thus Hubble's value is equivalent to approximately 2
<A HREF="./glossary.html#Gyr">Gyr</A>.  Since
this should be close to the <A HREF="./age.html">age of the Universe</A>, 
and we know
(and it was known in 1929) that the age of the Earth is larger
than 2 billion years, Hubble's value for H<SUB>o</SUB> led to considerable
skepticism about cosmological models, and motivated the
<A HREF="./stdystat.htm">Steady State</A> model.  
However, later work found
that Hubble had confused two different kinds of Cepheid variable
stars used for calibrating 
<A HREF="./distance.htm">distances,</A> and also that what Hubble
thought were bright stars in distant galaxies were actually
H II regions.  Correcting for these errors has led to a lowering
of the value of the Hubble constant: there are now primarily
two groups using Cepheids: the 
<A HREF="http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/H0kp/">
HST Distance Scale Key Project</A>
team (Freedman, Kennicutt, Mould etal) which gets 68 to 78
km/sec/Mpc, while the Sandage team, also using HST observations
of Cepheids to calibrate Type Ia supernovae, gets 57+/-4 km/sec/Mpc.
Other methods to determine the distance scale include the
time delay in gravitational lenses and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich
effect in distant clusters: both are independent of the Cepheid
calibration and give values consistent with the average of the
two HST groups: 65+/-8 km/sec/Mpc.  With this value for H<SUB>o</SUB>,
the "age" 1/H<SUB>o</SUB> is 15 Gyr.
</P>

<P>
Hubble's data in 1929 is actually quite poor, since individual
galaxies have peculiar velocities of several hundred km/sec,
and Hubble's data only went out to 1200 km/sec.  This has led
some people to propose
<A HREF="segal_errors.html">quadratic redshift-distance laws</A>,
but the data shown below on Type Ia SNe from 
Riess, Press and Kirshner (1996)
<BR><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="./rpk_sn1a.gif" WIDTH=505 HEIGHT=469 ALT="RPK 1996 data">
</CENTER><BR>
extend beyond 30,000 km/sec and provide a dramatic confirmation of
the Hubble law,
<PRE>
v = dD/dt = H*D
</PRE>
The fitted line in this graph has a slope of 64 km/sec/Mpc.
Since we measure the radial velocity using the Doppler shift, it
is often called the <EM>redshift</EM>.  The redshift z is defined
such that:
<PRE>
1 + z = lambda(observed)/lambda(emitted)
</PRE>
where lambda is the wavelength of a line or feature in the spectrum
of an object.  We know from <A HREF="./relatvty.htm">relativity</A>
that the redshift is given by
<PRE>
1 + z = sqrt((1+v/c)/(1-v/c))      so     v = cz + ...
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
The subscript "o" in H<SUB>o</SUB> (pronounced "aitch naught") indicates the
current value of a time variable quantity.  Since the 1/H<SUB>o</SUB> is
approximately the age of the Universe, the value of H depends on
time.  Another quantity with a naught is t<SUB>o</SUB>, the age of the
Universe.
</P>

<P>
The linear distance-redshift law found by Hubble is compatible with
a Copernican view of the Universe:  our position is not a special one.  
First note that the recession velocity is symmetric: if A sees B receding,
then B sees that A is receding, as shown in this diagram:
<BR><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="./receding.gif" WIDTH=638 HEIGHT=189 ALT="mutual recession diagram">
</CENTER><BR>
which is based on a sketch by Bob Kirshner.
Then consider the following 
<A HREF="./st_diags.htm">space-time diagram</A> showing 
several nearby galaxies moving away from us
from our point of view (galaxy A, the blue worldline)
on the top and from galaxy B's (the green worldline) point of view on
the bottom.
<BR><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="./linshift.gif" WIDTH=570 HEIGHT=178 ALT="shift for linear law">
</CENTER><BR>
The diagrams from the two different points of view are identical except
for the names of the galaxies.
The v(sq) = D<SUP>2</SUP> quadratic law, on the other hand,
transforms into an anisotropic non-quadratic law when changing points of
view, as shown below.
<BR><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="./quadshft.gif" WIDTH=568 HEIGHT=172 ALT="shift for square law">
</CENTER><BR>
Thus if we saw a quadratic velocity vs. distance law, then an
observer in a different galaxy would see a different law -- 
and one that would be different in different directions.
Thus if we saw v(sq), then B would see much higher radial velocities
in the "plus" direction than in the "minus" direction.
This effect would allow one to locate the "center of Universe"
by finding the one place where the redshift-distance law was
the same in all directions.  Since we actually see the same
redshift-distance law in all directions, either the
redshift-distance law is linear or else we are at the
center which is anti-Copernican.
</P>

<P>
The Hubble law generates a
<A HREF="distort.html">homologous expansion</A>
which does not change the shapes of objects,
while other possible velocity-distance relations lead to distortions
during expansion.
</P>

<P>
The Hubble law defines a special frame of reference at any
point in the Universe.  An observer with a large motion with 
respect to the Hubble flow would measure blueshifts in front
and large redshifts behind, instead of the same redshifts 
proportional to distance in all directions.  
Thus we can measure our motion relative to the Hubble flow,
which is also our motion relative to the observable
Universe.  A <EM>comoving</EM>
observer is at rest in this special frame of reference.  Our
Solar System is not quite comoving: we have a velocity of 370
km/sec relative to the observable Universe.  The Local Group
of galaxies, which includes the Milky Way, appears to be moving
at 600 km/sec relative to the observable Universe.
</P>

<P>
Hubble also measured the number of galaxies in different directions
and at different brightness in the sky.  He found approximately
the same number of faint galaxies in all directions, even though
there is a large excess of bright galaxies in the Northern part of
the sky.  When a distribution is the same in all directions,
it is <EM>isotropic</EM>.
And when he looked for galaxies with fluxes brighter
than F/4 he saw approximately 8 times more galaxies than he
counted which were brighter than F.  Since a flux 4 times smaller
implies a doubled distance, and hence a detection volume that
is 8 times larger, this indicated that the Universe is close
to <EM>homogeneous</EM> (having uniform density) on large scales.
<BR><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="./homo_iso.gif" WIDTH=480 HEIGHT=238 
ALT="Homogeneous but not isotropic and vice-versa">
</CENTER><BR>
The figure above shows a homogeneous but not isotropic pattern on the
left
and an isotropic but not homogeneous pattern on the right.  If
a figure is isotropic from more than 1 (2 if spherical) points, then
it must also be homogeneous.
</P>

<P>
Of course the Universe is not really homogeneous and isotropic,
because it contains dense regions like the Earth.  But it can still
be statistically homogeneous and isotropic, like this 
<A HREF="./deepgal.gif">24 kB simulated galaxy field</A>, which is
homogeneous and isotropic after smoothing out small scale details.
<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9311057">
Peacock and Dodds (1994, MNRAS, 267, 1020)</A> have looked at the
fractional density fluctuations in the nearby Universe as a function of
the radius of a top-hat smoothing filter, and find:
<BR><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="./deltarho.gif" WIDTH=414 HEIGHT=344
ALT="delta(rho)/rho versus top-hat radius, H=65">
</CENTER><BR>
Thus for 100 Mpc regions the Universe is smooth to within several percent.
<A HREF="./lcrs.html">Redshift surveys</A> of very large regions confirm
this tendency toward smoothness on the largest scales, even though
<A HREF="./nearby_galaxies.html">nearby galaxies</A> show large
inhomogeneities like the Virgo Cluster and the supergalactic plane.
</P>

<P>
The case for an isotropic and homogeneous Universe became much stronger
after Penzias and Wilson announced the discovery of the Cosmic Microwave
Background in 1965.  They observed an excess flux at 7.5 cm wavelength
equivalent to the radiation from a blackbody with a temperature of
3.7+/-1 degrees Kelvin.  [The Kelvin temperature scale has degrees of the
same size as the Celsius scale, but it is referenced at absolute zero,
so the freezing point of water is 273.15 K.]  
A blackbody radiator is an object that absorbs any radiation that hits it,
and has a constant temperature.
Many groups have measured
the intensity of the CMB at different wavelengths.  Currently the best
information on the spectrum of the CMB comes from the FIRAS instrument
on the 
<A HREF="http://space.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/cobe/cobe_home.html">COBE</A>
satellite, and it is shown below:
<BR><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="./spectrum.gif" WIDTH=550 HEIGHT=459 ALT="FIRAS CMB spectrum">
</CENTER><BR>
The x axis variable is the wavenumber or 1/[wavelength in cm].  
The y axis variable is the power per unit area per unit frequency per
unit solid angle in MegaJanskies per steradian.  1
<A HREF="http://www.gb.nrao.edu/~fghigo/fgdocs/jansky/jansky.html">Jansky</A>
is 10<SUP>-26</SUP> Watts per square meter per Hertz.
The error
bars have been multiplied by 400 so they can be seen, but the data points
are consistent with the radiation from a blackbody with 
T<SUB>o</SUB> = 2.725 K.
</P>

<P>
The temperature of the CMB is almost the same all over the sky.
The figure below shows a map of the temperature on a scale where
0 K is black and 3 K is white.
<BR><CENTER>
<IMG SRC="./locntrst.gif" WIDTH=511 HEIGHT=268

Thus the microwave sky is extremely isotropic.
These observations are combined into the Cosmological Principle:
</P>

<A NAME="CP">
<H2>The Universe is Homogeneous and Isotropic</H2>
</A>

<P>
Another piece of evidence in favor of the Big Bang is the abundance of
the light elements, like hydrogen, deuterium (heavy hydrogen), helium
and lithium.  As the Universe expands, the photons of the CMB lose
energy due to the redshift and the CMB becomes cooler.  That means that
the CMB temperature was higher in the past.  When the Universe was 
only a few minutes old, the temperature was high enough to make the
light elements by nuclear fusion.  The theory of
<A HREF="http://astron.berkeley.edu/~mwhite/darkmatter/bbn.html">
Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</A> predicts that about 1/4 of the mass of the
Universe should be helium, which is very close to what is observed.
The abundance of deuterium is inversely related to the density of
<A HREF="./glossary.html#nucleon">
nucleons</A> in the Universe, and the observed value of the deuterium
abundance suggests that there is one nucleon for every 4 to 7 cubic
meters of space in the the Universe.
