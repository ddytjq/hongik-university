<li> The <b>Trends in Biotechnology</b> cover
June 1990, Volume 8 No.6 shows
an SEM image of a left-handed DNA with the words
"Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy of Biomolecules".
In the article itself ("Scanning tunnelling
Microscopy in Biotechnology", P. G. Arscott and V. A. Bloomfield,
page 153), fig 2 shows a left-handed DNA with a figure legend
stating that it is "in the left-handed Z form".

| Dear Smithsonian:
| 
| 1. I came across your web page:

| 
| and have added it to my web page about left handed DNA that was just cited in
| the latest Science:
| 
|    http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/LeftHanded.DNA.html
| 
| I am pointing to your web page.
| 
| May I have permission to include this gif on my page?
| 
| 
| 2. Also, further up that same page at
| 
|    http://www.sil.si.edu/exhibits/artistsbook/bioc.htm#27
| 
| the image:
| 
|    http://www.sil.si.edu/exhibits/artistsbook/95-20526.jpg
| 
| is internally inconsistant.  The original paper covers pages
| 737 to 738, but the image has it as 736-37 at the bottom.
| 
| 
| 3.  May I have permission to keep a copy of
| 
|    http://www.sil.si.edu/exhibits/artistsbook/95-20526.jpg
| 
| on my web site?
| 
| 
| 4.  Finally, Will you be keeping this exhibit available eternally?  I hope
| so!!
| 
| Thanks!

| Dear Tom,
| 
| Thanks for the communication.  We are looking into the internal inconsisten=
| cy. Thanks for the alert.
| 
| Can you use one of our images on your web site? My understanding of images =
| on the web is that they are available to interested parties since there is =
| no practical way to protect their re-use in an open web environment =
| (though there are provisions to protect and/or sell on some sites, this is =
| not the case for this online exhibition).  So the answer to your question =
| is, you do not need SIL's permission to use these imgees on your own home =
| page. Naturally we would appreciate it is you would credit both the =
| Smithsonian Institution Libraries and this show in particular.    I will =
| be consulting the Smithsonian's legal office soon on another matter, and =
| will raise this, just to check.
| 
| Do we plan to keep this up for eternity? Sure, why not?   We mounted it as =
| a permanent exhibition.  The only change I foresee is not to the script =
| and images, but perhaps to the online design of the show. And that's not =
| on our agenda right now.
| 
| Thanks for your interest. nm 11/24/98

<b> C. K. Mathews and K. E. van Holde</b>,
The Benjamin / Cummings Publishing Company, Inc.
Redwood City, California, ISBN 0-8053-5015-2, 1990.
Page 923 shows RNA polymerases working on left
handed DNA that somehow manages to switch over
to right handed DNA elsewhere on a circular plasmid.
This is a pretty clear example of an
artist flipping a drawing over.
This textbook drawing was meant
to show
how transcription can cause supercoiling.
It shows two polymerases transcribing
towards each other, but with opposite
DNA twists.
A student could become rather confused:
the DNA as drawn would not become supercoiled
by the transcription!

For your first visit to the
<a href = "http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/LeftHanded.DNA.html">Left Handed
Hall of Fame</a>
 page I suggest that you follow the story
over <a href = Leftwhole.html>all of the years</a>.
After that you can look at each year individually
from the table below.
Note:  just because a year has gone by does not mean
we haven't found more examples for that year!

<h1>1997 and 1998 were bumper crop years<br>
and 1999 beat them more than 2 fold.
2000 was a record year, thanks to help from
friends around the world
(60 of the 97 cases, 63%!).
2001 will exceed even that record!
