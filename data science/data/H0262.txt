<li> <a name = "absolute_coordinate">
<b>absolute coordinate</b>:  A number (usually integer)
that describes a specific position on a nucleic acid or protein sequence.
An example of using two absolute coordinates in
<a href = "#delila_instructions">Delila instructions</a> is:
"<b>get from 1 to 6;</b>"  The numerals

<li> <a name = "acceptor_splice_site">
<b>acceptor splice site</b>:
Usually the binding site of the spliceosome
on the 3' side of an intron and the 5' side of an exon.
This term is preferred over "3' site" because there can
be multiple acceptor sites, in which case "3' site" is
ambiguous.
Also, one would have to refer to the 3' site on the 5' side
of an exon, which is confusing.
Mechanistically, an acceptor site defines the beginning of the exon, 
not the other way around.
See
<ul>
<li> Example 1:
There are two acceptor sites at
the 3' end of
<a href =

the normal site (12.7
<a href = "#bit">bit</a>)
and
a strong (8.9
<a href = "#bit">bit</a>)
cryptic acceptor site
Calling both of these `$3'$ sites' would be confusing.

A good criterion for finding an alignment is to

</ul>

<li> <a name = "binding_site_symmetry">
<b>binding site symmetry</b>:
<a href = "#binding_site" >binding sites</a>
on nucleic acids have three kinds
of asymmetry and symmetry:
<ul>
<li><strong>asymmetric</strong> - All sites on RNA and probably
most if not all sites on DNA bound by a single polypeptide will
be asymmetric.
Example:
      RNA: <a href =
      "http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/sequencelogo.html#splice" 
      target = "reference"
      >splice sites</a>;
      DNA: <a href =
      "http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/sequencelogo.html#tata" 
      target = "reference"
      >Yeast TATA</a>.
<li>
<strong>symmetric</strong> -
Sites on DNA bound by a dimeric
protein <i>usually</i> (there are exceptions!) have a two-fold dyad
axis of symmetry.  This means that there is a line passing through
the DNA, perpendicular to its long axis, about which a 180 degree rotation
will bring the DNA helix phosphates back into register with their
original positions.  There are two places that the dyad axis can be
set:
  <ul>
  <li><strong>odd symmetric</strong> - The axis is on a single base,
      so that the site contains an odd number of bases.
      Examples:
      <a href =
      "http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/sequencelogo.html#helixrepa" 
      target = "reference"
      >gallery of 8 logos</a>:
      lambda cI and cro and Lambda O.
  <li><strong>even symmetric</strong> - The axis is between two bases,
      so that the site contains an even number of bases.
      Examples:
      <a href =
      "http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/sequencelogo.html#helixrepa" 
      target = "reference"
      >gallery of 8 logos</a>:
      434 cI and cro,
      ArgR,
      CRP,
      TrpR,
      FNR,
      LexA.
  </ul>
</ul>
<strong>Placement of zero coordinate</strong>:
For consistency,
one can place the
<a href = "#zero_coordinate">zero coordinate</a>
on a binding site according to its symmetry
and some simple rules.
<ul>
<li> Asymmetric sites:
at a position of high sequence conservation
or the start of transcription or translation
<li>Odd symmetry site: at the center of the site
<li> Even symmetry site:
for simplicity,
the suggested convention is to place the
<a href = "#zero_base">zero base</a>
on the 5' side of the axis so that the bases 0 and 1 surround the axis.
</ul>
Within the  
<a href = "#delila">Delila</a>
system, the
<a href = "http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/delila/instshift.html"
target = "reference">instshift</a>
program makes readjusting the zero coordinate easy.
<br>
<strong>The Symmetry Paradox</strong>:
Note that specific individual sites may not be symmetrical
(<i>i.e.</i> completely self-complementary)
even though
the set of all sites are bound symmetrically.
This raises an odd experimental problem.  How do we know that
a site is symmetric when bound by a dimeric protein if each individual
site has variation on the two sides?
If we assume that the site is symmetrical,
then we would write
<a href = "#delila_instructions">Delila instructions</a>
for both the sequence and its complement.
The resulting
<a href = "#sequence_logo">sequence logo</a>
will, <i>by definition</i> be symmetrical.
If, on the other hand, we write the instructions so as to take only
one orientation from each sequence, perhaps arbitrarily,
then
<i>by definition</i> the logo will be asymmetrical.
That is, one gets the output of what one puts in.
This is a serious philosophical and practical problem for creating
good models of binding sites.
One solution would be to use a model that has the maximum 
<a href = "#information">information</a>
content
although this may be difficult to determine in many cases because of
small sample sizes.

<li> <a name = "bit">
<b>bit</b>:
A binary digit, or
the amount of
<a href = "#information">information</a>
required to distinguish between two equally likely possibilities or choices.
If I tell you that a coin
is "heads" then you learn one bit of information.
It's like a knife slice between the possibilities:
<table>
<tr><td><img src = "icons/tail.gif" height = 50 width = 50></td>
    <td><img src = "icons/head.gif" height = 50 width = 50></td>
</table>
Likewise, if a protein picks one of the 4 bases,
then it makes a two bit choice.

For 8 things it takes <a href =
"http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/paper/nano2/latex/paper.html#fig.box"
target = "reference">3
bits</a>.
In simple cases the number of bits is the log base 2
of the number of choices or
<a href = "#message">messages</a>
<i>M</i>:
bits = log<sub><i>2</i></sub><i>M</i>.
<a href = "#Shannon">Claude Shannon</a>
figured out how to compute the average information
when the choices are not equally likely.
<font color = "blue">
The reason for using this measure
is that when
two communication systems are independent,
the number of bits is additive.
</font>
The log is the only mathematical measure that has this property!
Both of the properties of averaging and additivity
are important for
<a href = "#sequence_logo">sequence logos</a>
and
<a href = "#sequence_walker">sequence walkers</a>.
Even in the early days of computers and information theory
people recognized that there were already two definitions
of <i>bit</i> and that nothing could be done about it.
The most common definition is 'binary digit',
usually a 0 or a 1 in a computer.
This definition allows only for two integer values.
The definition that Shannon came up with is an
average number of bits that describes an
entire communication
<a href = "#message">message</a>
(or, in molecular biology,
a set of aligned protein sequences
or nucleic-acid
<a href = "#binding_site">binding sites</a>).
This latter definition allows for real numbers.
Fortunately the two definitions can be distinguished
by context.

that the "box" is an artifact.

The maximum information, in bits per second, that a communications

<img src = "icons/capacity.gif" ALT="C = W log 2(P/N + 1) bits/second"><br>
where
<i>W</i> is the bandwidth (cycles per second = hertz),
<i>P</i> is the received power (joules per second)
and
<i>N</i> is the
<a href = "#noise">noise</a>

<a href = "#Shannon">Shannon</a>
derived this formula by realizing that
the received
<a href = "#message">message</a>
can be represented as a sphere in a high dimensional space.
The maximum number of messages is determined by
the diameter of these spheres
and the available space.
The diameter of the spheres is determined by the
<a href = "#noise">noise</a>
and the available space is a sphere determined by the total power
and the noise.
Shannon realized that by dividing the volume of the larger
sphere by the volume of the smaller message spheres,
one would obtain the maximum number of messages.
The logarithm (base 2) of this number is the channel capacity.
In the formula, the
<a href = "#signal-to-noise_ratio">signal-to-noise ratio</a>
is P/N.
Shannon's channel capacity theorem states that if one attempts
to transmit information at a rate <i>R</i> greater than <i>C</i> only
at best <i>C</i> will be received.
On the other hand if <i>R</i> is less than or equal to <i>C</i>
then one may have as few errors as desired,
so long as the channel is properly <a href = "#code">coded</a>.
As a consequence of this theorem, many methods of coding
have been derived, and as a result we now have
satellite communications,
the internet,

The simplest form of a consensus sequence
is created by picking 
the most frequent base 
at some position in a set of
aligned
DNA, RNA or protein
sequences such as 
<a href = "#binding_site">binding sites</a>.
The process of creating a consensus destroys the
frequency information and leads to many errors in interpreting
sequences.
It is one of the worst
<a href = "http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/pitfalls.html"

>pitfalls</a>
in molecular biology.
Suppose a position in a binding site had 75% A.  The consensus
would be A.  Later, after having forgotten
the origin of the consensus while trying to make a prediction,
one would be wrong 25% of the
time.  If this is done over all the positions of a binding site,
<i>most</i> predicted sites can be wrong!
For example,

Coordinate

It is a language for extracting DNA fragments from a large collection of
sequences, invented around 1980
(T. D. Schneider,
 G. D. Stormo,
 J. S. Haemer,
 and L. Gold",
A design for computer nucleic-acid sequence storage, retrieval and
manipulation,
Nucl. Acids Res.,
10:
3013-3024,
1982).
The idea is that there is a large database containing all the sequences
one would like, which we call a `library'.
(It is amusing and appropriate that
<a href = "http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/Genbank/GenbankOverview.html"
target = "reference">GenBank</a>
now resides at the
<a href = "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"
target = "reference">National Library of Medicine</a>!)
One would like a particular subset of these sequences, so one writes
up some instructions and gives them to the librarian, Delila,
which returns a
`<a href = "#book">book</a>'
containing just the sequences
one wants for a particular analysis.
So `Delila' also stands for the program that does the extraction
(<a href =
"http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/delila/delila.html"
target = "reference">delila.p</a>).
Since it is easier to manipulate Delila instructions than to
edit DNA sequences, one makes fewer mistakes
in generating one's data set for analysis,
and they are trivial to correct.
Also, a number of programs create instructions, which provides
a powerful means of sequence manipulation. 
One of Delila's strengths is that it can handle any continuous
<a href = "#coordinate_system">coordinate system</a>.
The `Delila system' refers to
<a href = "http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/delila.html"
target = "reference">a set of programs</a>
that use these sequence subsets for
<a href = "#molecular_information_theory">molecular information theory</a>
analysis of
<a href = "#binding_site">binding sites</a>
and proteins.
In the spring of 1999 Delila became capable of making sequence mutations,
which can be displayed graphically along with

on a <a href = "#lister_map">lister map</a>.

Supposedly living creatures feed on `negentropy' from the sun.
However it is impossible for entropy to be negative, so `negentropy' is
always a negative quantity.
The easiest way to see this is to consider the statistical-mechanics
(Boltzmann) form of the
<a href = "#entropy">entropy</a>
equation:<br>
<img border=0 align = left
src = "http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/icons/boltzmannentropy.gif">
<br clear = all>
where <i>k<sub>b</sub></i> is Boltzmann's constant,
<img border=0
src = "http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/icons/omega.gif">
is the number of microstates of the system
and
<i>P<sub>i</sub></i>
is the probability of microstate <i>i</i>.
Unless one wishes to consider imaginary probabilities (!)
it can be proven that S is positive or zero.
Rather than saying `negentropy' or `negative entropy',
it is more clear to note that when a system
dissipates energy to its surroundings, its entropy decreases.
So it is better to refer to
-delta S (a negative <i>change</i> in entropy).
<font color = green>Recommendation</font>:
replace this concept with
`<a href = "#entropy">decrease in entropy</a>'.

John Maddox
says
"Maxwell's demon ...
must be a device for creating negative entropy".
The Demon is required to create <i>decreases</i> in entropy, not
the impossible `negentropy'.

<li> <a name = "nit">
<b>nit</b>:
Natural units for information or uncertainty.
If there are M

then ln(M) nits are required to select one of them,
where ln is the natural logarithm with base e
(=2.71828...).
Natural units are used in thermodynamics where
they simplify the mathematics.
However nits are awkward to use
because results are almost never integers.
In contrast the bit unit is easy to use because
many results are integer (<i>e.g.</i> log<sub>2</sub> 32 = 5)
and these are easy to memorize.
Using
the relationship
ln x / ln 2 = log<sub>2</sub> x
allows one to present all results in bits.

<li> <a name = "parameter_file">
<b>parameter file</b>:
Many

files.
These are always simple text files, which is a robust 
method that will work on any computer system. 
Details on how to create the parameter file are always given on the 
manual page for the program.
It is usually easiest to start from an example 
(also given on the manual page) and modify it.   
Parameters are given on individual text lines.
If the entire line is not a parameter,
then any text 
after the parameter is ignored and serves as a comment. 
For example,
the program
<a href =

`<a href =

automatically.

<!-- A coding method a bit in word of  -->
A parity bit determines a 
<a href = "#code">code</a>
in which one data
<a href = "#bit">bit</a>
is set to either 0 or 1 so as to always
make a transmitted binary word contain an even or odd number of 1s.
The receiver can then count the number of 1's
to determine if there was a single error.
This code can only be used to detect an odd number of errors but
cannot be used to correct any error.
Unfortunately for molecular biologists,
the now-universal method for coding characters,
7 bit ASCII words,
assigns to the symbols for the nucleotide bases
A, C and G
only a one bit difference between A and C
and a one bit difference between C and G: <br>

G: 107<sub>8</sub> = 1000111<sub>2</sub> <br>
T: 124<sub>8</sub> = 1010100<sub>2</sub> <br>

this choice could cause errors
during transmission of DNA sequences to the

the situation is improved and more

It is the latter which is usually meant.
If one does not use correct units, one will not get correct
results.
<font color = green>Recommendation</font>:
if you are making computations from symbols,
<i>always</i> use the term
<a href =
"#uncertainty"
>uncertainty</a>, with recommended units of
<a href =
"#bit"
>bits</a> per symbol.
If you mean the entropy of a physical system, then
use the term
<a href =
"#entropy"
>entropy</a>, which has units of joules per kelvin
(energy per temperature).

The story is paraphrased from 
M. Tribus and E. C. McIrvine,
"Energy and Information",
Sci. Am.,
225,
(Note: the table of contents in this volume incorrectly lists this as volume 224),

September,
1971.

<li> <a name = "Shannon_sphere">
<b>Shannon sphere</b>:
A sphere in a high dimensional space which represents either
a single
<a href = "#message">message</a>
of a communications system
(<a href = "#after_sphere">after sphere</a>)
or the volume that contains all possible messages
(<a href = "#before_sphere">before sphere</a>)
could be called a Shannon sphere, in honor of Claude
<a href = "#Shannon">Shannon</a>
who recognized its importance in
<a href = "#information_theory">information_theory</a>.
The radius of the smaller <i>after</i> spheres is determined
by the ambient <a href = "#thermal_noise">thermal noise</a>,
while that of the larger
<i>before</i> sphere is determined
by both the
<a href = "#thermal_noise">thermal noise</a> and the signal power
(<a href = "#signal-to-noise_ratio">signal-to-noise ratio</a>),
measured at the receiver.
The log of the number of 
small spheres that can fit into the larger sphere
determines the
<a href = "#channel_capacity">channel capacity</a>
(See: <a href = "#Shannon1949">Shannon1949</a>).
</a>
The high-dimensional packing of the spheres 
is the <a href = "#coding">coding</a> of the system. 
There are two ways to understand how the spheres come to be.
Consider a digital <a href = "#message">message</a>
consisting of independent voltage pulses.
The independent voltage values specify a point in a high dimensional space
since independence is represented by coordinate axes set at right
angles to each other.  Thus three voltage pulses correspond to a point
in a 3 dimensional space and 100 pulses correspond to a point
in a 100 dimensional space.
The first `non-Cartesian' way to understand the spheres is to note that
<a href = "#thermal_noise">thermal noise</a> interferes with the initial
message during transmission of the information such that the received
point is dislocated from the initial point.
Since noisy distortion can be in any direction, the set of all possible
dislocations is a sphere.
The second `Cartesian' method is to note that the
sum of many small dislocations to
each pulse, caused by thermal noise, gives a Gaussian distribution
at the receiver.
The probability that a received pulse is disturbed a
distance <i>x</i> from the initial voltage is
of the form
<i>p(x) &asymp; e<sup>-x<sup>2</sup></sup></i>.
Disturbance of a second pulse will have the same form,
<i>p(y) &asymp; e<sup>-y<sup>2</sup></sup></i>.
Since these are independent,
the probability of both distortions
is multiplied:
<i>p(x,y) = p(x) p(y)</i>.
Combining equations,
<i>p(x,y) &asymp; e<sup>-(x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>)</sup>
= e<sup>-r<sup>2</sup></sup></i>, where <i>r</i> is the radial
distance.  If <i>p(x,y)</i> is a constant, the locus of all points enscribed
by <i>r</i> is a circle.  With more pulses the same argument holds, giving
spheres in high dimensional space.
<a href = "#Shannon">Shannon</a> used this construction in his
<a href = "#channel_capacity">channel capacity</a>
theorem.
For a
<a href = "#molecular_machine">molecular machine</a>
containing <i>n</i> atoms there can be as many as
<i>3n-6</i> independent components (degrees of freedom)
so there can be
<i>3n-6</i> dimensions.
The velocity of these components corresponds to the voltage
in a communication system and they are disturbed by thermal
noise.  Thus the state of a molecular machine can also
be described by a sphere in a high dimensional velocity space.

In molecular biology, the equivalent is the energy dissipated
divided by the thermal noise.

<li> <a name = "specificity">
<b>specificity</b>:
<font color = red>Poor Terminology!</font>
The term is ill defined.  It has been used to
refer to livers (tissue specificity), energy, binding
patterns and other mutually inconsistent concepts.
<font color = green>Recommendation</font>:
use the appropriate precise term (energy, bits, information etc.) instead.

<li> <a name = "surprisal">
<b>surprisal</b>:
How surprised one would be by a single symbol in a stream of symbols.
It is computed
from the probability of the <i>i<sup>th</sup></i> symbol,
<i>P<sub>i</sub></i>,
as
<i>u<sub>i</sub> = - log<sub>2</sub>P<sub>i</sub></i>.
For example, late at night as I write this,
the phone rarely rings so the probability
of silence is close to 1 and the surprisal for silence is near zero.
(If the probability of silence is 99% then
<i>u<sub>silence</sub> = - log<sub>2</sub>0.99 = 0.01</i>
bits per second, where the phone can ring only once per second.)
On the other hand a ring is rare so the surprisal
for ringing is very high.
(For example,
if the probability of ringing is 1% per second then
<i>u<sub>ring</sub> = - log<sub>2</sub>0.01 = 6.64</i> bits per second.)
The average of all surprisals over the entire signal
is the <a href = "#uncertainty">uncertainty</a>.
(<i>0.99 * 0.01 + 0.01 * 6.64 = 0.08</i>
bits per second in this "phone"y example. ;-)
The term comes from Myron Tribus' book
"Thermostatics and Thermodynamics"
(D. van Nostrand Company, Inc.,
Princeton, N. J.,
1961).

<li> <a name = "thermal_noise">

Since the third law of thermodynamics prevents one from extracting

In 1928 Nyquist worked out the thermodynamics of noise
in electrical systems and in a back-to-back paper
Johnson demonstrated that the theory was correct.
