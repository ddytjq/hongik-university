      <p><b>*Re: Mississippi Winter Classic</b></p>
      <p><b><br>
      To Open 2002 Columbus Speedway Season<br>
      Columbus, Mississippi-Columbus Speedway will kick off the 2002 racing
      season<br>
      with the second annual Mississippi Winter Classic presented by Jay Dickens<br>
      Racing Engines of Aberdeen, Mississippi. The main event will be a 45-lap<br>
      Super Late Model feature paying $5,000 to win for the one day show. Many
      of<br>
      the finest drivers in the South are expected to be on hand vying for the
      win<br>
      in the 2002 Mississippi Racing season.<br>
      The inaugural event last year saw 52 Super Late Models christen the new
      high<br>
      banked configuration on the now popular 3/10's mile red clay oval. The<br>
      victor last year was Chunky, Mississippi's James Dean who went flag to
      flag<br>
      in dominating fashion. Another strong field of participants should be on<br>
      hand for one of the highest paying one day events in the history of the<br>
      track.<br>
      All exciting local divisions will be in action at the Winter Classic as
      many<br>
      drivers will debut new machines for the 2002 season while others will move<br>
      up the ladder to take new challenges in different divisions. Classes in<br>
      action include the fast growing Mississippi (IMCA Type) Modified division<br>
      along with the Pro Streets, popular Street Stocks, Mini Stocks, Pro 4's,
      and<br>
      wild and crazy two-person Cruiser class which has quickly become a fan<br>
      favorite among the Columbus locals. All classes will run under the<br>
      guidelines of 2002 Columbus Speedway rules which can be found on the<br>
      Columbus Speedway homepage hosted at <a href="http://www.MidSouthRacing.com">www.MidSouthRacing.com</a>
      .<br>
      The mantra of continuous improvement still reigns at Columbus Speedway for<br>
      2002. Track manager Johnny Stokes continues to improve accommodations for<br>
      the swelling number of competitors who have flocked to the track in record<br>
      numbers, by adding increased pit parking to hold an additional 50 racecars<br>
      as participant records are expected to continue to be set in 2002.<br>
      Additional grandstand and pit seating will also be in place by March with<br>
      the cooperation of the weather. The added room is in preparation for the<br>
      upcoming season as Columbus Speedway is providing fans and drivers one of<br>
      the most ambitious special event schedules in the nation along with<br>
      presenting the extremely popular weekly racing program.</b></p>
      <p><b><br>
      The Jay Dicken's Mississippi Winter Classic will get underway on January<br>
      25th with a special Friday afternoon test and tune session from 2pm until<br>
      5pm. The session is open to all competitors and there will be free<br>
      grandstand admission for the fans. Pit gates will open at 11am.<br>
      Action will then heat up on Saturday the 26th as racing action gets
      underway<br>
      with the big money on the line. The line up will consist of Super Late
      Model<br>
      Pole Qualifying and local division qualifying races. The Super Late Models<br>
      will then run either two or three B-Main's to fill out the remainder of
      the<br>
      24-car starting field. Main events in all divisions will conclude the<br>
      afternoon highlighted by the $5,000 to win 45-lap Jay Dickens Racing
      Engines<br>
      Super Late Model Winter Championship. Gates will open at 8am with Hot Laps<br>
