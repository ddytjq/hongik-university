<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Immediately after HIV infects a cell, the virion RNA is copied
into DNA and the proviral genome is transported to the nucleus and
integrated into the host cell genome. Once integrated into the host
chromosome, the HIV becomes subject to regulation by cellular
transcription factors, as well as its own regulatory proteins. HIV
transcription is controlled primarily by the <I>trans</I>-activator
protein (Tat). Tat provides the first example of the regulation of
viral gene expression through control of elongation by RNA polymerase
II. In the absence of Tat, initiation from the LTR is efficient but
transcription is impaired because the promoter engages poorly
processive polymerases that disengage from the DNA template
prematurely.</P>

<P><B>Regulatory circuits controlling HIV transcription</B></P>

<P>The ability of the HIV LTR to act as an inducible promoter was
first described by Sodroski <I>et al</I>. (1985) who noted that the
synthesis of reporter genes placed under the control of the viral
long terminal repeat (LTR) was stimulated 200- to 300-fold in cells
which had been previously infected by HIV. They reasoned that the
induction, or "transactivation", of transcription was due to the
presence of a novel <I>trans-</I>activating factor, which they named
Tat.</P>

<P>The majority of investigators assumed initially that Tat interacts
directly with the promoter to stimulate initiation because most of
the known regulatory proteins that control gene expression are
DNA-binding proteins that work at the level of transcription
initiation (Sharp &amp; Marciniak, 1989). However, the pattern of
transcription from the HIV LTR suggested that Tat does not stimulate
initiation. When cells are transfected by plasmids carrying the HIV
LTR characteristically produce two populations of transcripts, a set
of short non-polyadenylated RNAs that terminate near the promoter,
and a set of full-length polyadenylated mRNAs (Kao <I>et al</I>.,
1987). In the absence of Tat, the short transcripts predominate,
whereas in the presence of Tat there is a dramatic increase in the
levels of long transcripts (Kao <I>et al</I>., 1987; Kessler &amp;
Mathews, 1992; Ratnasabapathy <I>et al</I>., 1990; Toohey &amp;
Jones, 1989). Thus, Tat participates in a positive feedback mechanism
that ensures high levels of HIV transcription following the
activation of cells carrying HIV proviruses. Furthermore, the shift
from short to long transcripts observed in these experiments strongly
implies that Tat actives transcription elongation.</P>

<P><B>The Tat/TAR RNA interaction</B></P>

<P>Deletion analysis of the viral LTR showed that the genetic element
responsible for Tat activity, the transactivation-responsive region
(TAR), is located downstream of the initiation site for transcription
nucleotides +1 and +59 (Figure 1). The location of TAR in a
transcribed region was surprising, since it suggested that TAR could
function as an RNA sequence rather than as a DNA element (Muesing
<I>et al</I>., 1987). The idea that TAR functions as an RNA
regulatory signal gained further support from the observation that
the TAR RNA sequence forms a highly stable, nuclease-resistant,
stem-loop structure. Mutations that destabilise the TAR stem by
disrupting base-pairing abolish Tat-stimulated transcription (Selby
<I>et al</I>., 1989).</P>

<P>The simplest explanation for the ability of Tat to stimulate
transcription from viral LTRs that carry TAR elements is that Tat
binds directly to TAR RNA. After purification of recombinant Tat by
an improved method we were able demonstrate that Tat is able to
specially recognize TAR RNA (Dingwall <I>et al</I>., 1989).
Subsequently, it was noted by Weeks <I>et al</I>. (1990) that
synthetic peptides carrying the basic domain of Tat are also able to
bind directly to TAR RNA.</P>

<P>Tat recognition of TAR requires the presence of a U-rich bulge
near the apex of the TAR RNA stem and the G26:C39 base pair
immediately above the bulge. TAR RNA mutations that affect the
structure of the U-rich bulge abolish Tat binding. However, so long
as Watson-Crick base pairing is maintained, the identity of most of
the base pairs throughout the TAR stem does not appear to be an
important requirement for Tat recognition.<BR>

<H6><B><I>Figure 1</I></B><I>. Structure of the HIV genome (top), the
viral promoter (bottom right) and TAR RNA (bottom left). The Tat gene
is encoded by two exons that are highlighted on the HIV genome map.
The viral promoter has a structure typical of promoters activated by
RNA polymerase II. Immediately upstream of the TATA box are two
tandem NF-kB binding sites and three tandem SP-1 binding sites.
Immediately downstream of the start of transcription is the
transactivation response region (TAR). TAR encodes an RNA that can
fold into the stem-loop structure shown at left. Tat is able to bind
directly to the highlighted region near to the apex of the stem
containing a UCU bulge. Critical residues for Tat binding are shown
in bold. In addition to acting as the binding site for Tat, TAR acts
as the recognition signal for a cellular co-factor interacting with
its apical loop sequence ("loop factor") (From (Karn,
1999)).</I></H6>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Surprisingly, Tat recognition of TAR requires conformational
changes in the RNA structure. NMR studies have shown that when Tat
binds to TAR RNA the first residue in the bulge (U23) is displaced by
one of the arginine side chains present in the basic binding domain
of the Tat protein. The displaced U23 residue then forms an arginine
binding pocket together with the critical G26:C39 base pair
(Aboul-ela <I>et al</I>., 1995; Aboul-ela <I>et al</I>., 1996;
Brodsky &amp; Williamson, 1997; Puglisi <I>et al</I>., 1992). This
conformational change also repositions critical phosphates on the TAR
RNA backbone so that they then can be contacted by other basic
residues found in the TAR RNA binding region and thereby ensure high
affinity binding of Tat (Pritchard <I>et al</I>., 1994).</P>

<P>Although <I>in vitro</I> studies showed that Tat was a highly
specific RNA binding protein, these studies did not by themselves
prove that Tat recognition of TAR RNA occurred in the cellular
context. In order demonstrate that this was actually the mechanism,
it was necessary to correlate the in vitro binding of Tat to TAR with
transactivation <I>in vivo</I>. The results showed that all the
mutations that reduced the ability of TAR RNA to bind to Tat also
blocked transactivation (Dingwall <I>et al</I>., 1990). Of particular
significance was the observation that mutations that produced a
partial reduction in Tat binding also produced a partial reduction in
Tat response.</P>

<P><B><I>In vitro</I> genetics</B></P>

<P>The first rigorous proof that Tat acts a general elongation factor
became possible with the development of cell-free transcription
systems that respond efficiently to Tat (Marciniak <I>et al</I>.,
1990). Activation of transcription by Tat in the cell free system
provides a remarkably accurate mimic of the <I>in vivo</I> mechanism.
Studies using an extensive series of templates carrying mutations in
TAR and the HIV promoter have shown that Tat-dependent
transactivation in vitro has the same sequence requirements seen
<I>in vivo</I> (Churcher <I>et al</I>., 1995; Rittner <I>et al</I>.,
1995).</P>

<P>One of the most important results to emerge from studies using the
cell free systems is the conclusive demonstration that Tat acts
exclusively at the level of elongation. For example, Marciniak &amp;
Sharp (1991) reported that the distribution of RNA polymerases
downstream of the viral LTR in the absence of Tat follows the pattern
expected for a generalised elongation factor that uniformly reduces
the probability of termination at each nucleotide along the template.
A further experimental demonstration that exposure to Tat alters RNA
polymerase processivity came from plasmids carrying artificial
terminator sequences (Graeble <I>et al</I>., 1993). Finally, 'chase'
experiments using elongation complexes paused during transcription by
the<I> lac </I>repressor protein provided a formal demonstration that
Tat constitutively activates the RNA polymerase (Keen <I>et al</I>.,
1997). Transcription complexes that have transcribed through TAR in
the presence of Tat showed high processivity, but complexes that were
prepared in the absence of Tat or which had transcribed through
mutant TAR elements showed defects in elongation.</P>

<P><B>The kinase connection</B></P>

<P>The constitutive modification of the transcription complex
following exposure to Tat could be due to the recruitment of a
transcription factor, or to the post-synthetic modification of the
RNA polymerase, or a combination of both events. One likely
modification of the RNA polymerase would be phosphorylation of the
carboxyl terminal domain (CTD), since modification of the CTD is
associated with promoter clearance (Laybourn &amp; Dahmus, 1990;
Marshall <I>et al</I>., 1996; O'Brien <I>et al</I>., 1994).</P>

<P>Rice and his colleagues (Herrmann <I>et al</I>., 1996; Herrmann
&amp; Rice, 1993; Herrmann &amp; Rice, 1995) were the first to
demonstrate that a protein kinase complex, which they called TAK
(Tat-associated kinase) binds tightly and specifically to Tat.
Cloning of the kinase subunit of TAK, the CDK9 kinase, by Zhu <I>et
al</I>. (1997) revealed a homology between TAK and pTEFb, a positive
acting elongation factor from Drosophila (Marshall <I>et al</I>.,
1996; Marshall &amp; Price, 1992; Marshall &amp; Price, 1995). pTEFb
is known to be present in early elongation complexes and required for
elongation after promoter clearance.</P>

<P>Genetic and biochemical arguments have provided impressive
evidence that TAK plays a critical role in the transactivation
mechanism. First, it was shown that Tat-dependent transcription can
be inhibited by protein kinase inhibitors such as DRB (Marciniak
&amp; Sharp, 1991) and a set of novel protein kinase inhibitors
isolated from screens of drugs that inhibit HIV replication (Mancebo
<I>et al</I>., 1997). Similarly, over-expression of CDK9 mutants
<I>in trans</I> results in inhibition of TAK activity and the
concomitant inhibition of Tat-dependent transcription (Gold <I>et
al</I>., 1998; Mancebo <I>et al</I>., 1997; West &amp; Karn, 1999).
Finally, immunodepletion of the HeLa nuclear extracts using
antibodies directed against CDK9 produced extracts that were unable
to respond to Tat, but transactivation could be restored by addition
of purified TAK (Mancebo <I>et al</I>., 1997; Zhu <I>et al</I>.,
1997).</P>

<P>Since none of these experiments provided direct evidence that CDK9
is specifically activated by Tat during transcription the possibility
remained that TAK simply plays an essential role in basal
transcription. However, in recent experiments using the cell free
system, we were able to show that Tat is able to stimulate additional
CTD phosphorylation in elongation complexes and create a novel form
of the RNA polymerase that we have called RNA polymerase
II<SUB>o</SUB>* (Isel &amp; Karn, 1999). This phosphorylation event
results in specific modifications of serine-5 in the CTD repeat (Zhou
<I>et al</I>., 2000).</P>

<P><B>Regulation of CDK9 by cyclin T1 and TAR</B></P>

<P>In addition to carrying the kinase subunit CDK9, TAK also contains
a cyclin subunit called cyclin T1 (Wei <I>et al</I>., 1998). Cyclin
T1 is required for CDK9 kinase activity and promotes
auto-phosphorylation of the C-terminus of CDK9 (Fong &amp; Zhou,
2000; Garber <I>et al</I>., 2000; Garber <I>et al</I>., 1998a).
Remarkably, in addition to regulating CDK9 activity, cyclin T1 is
able to mediate Tat association with TAR RNA (Figure 2).<BR>

</P>

<H6><B><I>Figure 2</I></B><I>. Recognition of TAR RNA by Tat and TAK.
Tat recognition primarily requires interactions with the bulge region
of TAR. In the presence of cyclin T1, conformational rearrangements
in Tat permit interactions with the apical loop sequences. Part of
the interface between Tat and cyclin T1 is believed to involve
cysteine residues from each protein that participate in zinc binding
(From Karn, 1999). </I></H6>

<P>It has been known for many years that sequences in the apical loop
of TAR RNA are not required for Tat binding even though this region
of the RNA is essential for efficient <I>trans-</I>activation (Feng
&amp; Holland, 1988; Selby <I>et al</I>., 1989). The genetics implied
that the loop acts as a binding site for cellular co-factors of Tat,
however the identity of the loop factor remained mysterious and
controversal for many years. The first unimpeachable evidence
identifying the cellular co-factor required for loop recognition was
obtained by Wei <I>et al</I>. (1998) who reported that cyclin T1, can
form a stable ternary complex with Tat and TAR RNA that could be
detected by gel electrophoresis. Ternary complex formation requires
both the Tat binding site on TAR as well as the loop sequence.
Similarly, Tat proteins carrying inactivating mutations, including
truncations of the N-terminus, also failed to form the ternary
complexes.</P>

<P>Genetic arguments were quickly assembled to confirm the
identification of cyclin T1 as the "loop factor". Tat is mostly
inactive in rodent cells even though initiation of transcription from
the HIV LTR is efficient. This suggested that a critical cellular
cofactor for Tat is dysfunctional in rodent cells. In keeping with
this hypothesis, analysis of the cyclin T1 sequence found in murine
cells showed that a critical cysteine residue found in the human
cyclin T1 is replaced by a tyrosine (Bieniasz <I>et al</I>., 1998;
Chen <I>et al</I>., 1999; Fujinaga <I>et al</I>., 1999; Garber <I>et
al</I>., 1998b; Ivanov <I>et al</I>., 1999; Kwak <I>et al</I>.,
1999). When the cysteine to tyrosine mutation is introduced into
human cyclin T1, its ability to form a ternary complex with Tat and
TAR RNA or to support HIV transactivation in transfected cells is
blocked (Fujinaga <I>et al</I>., 1999; Garber <I>et al</I>., 1998b;
Ivanov <I>et al</I>., 1999; Kwak <I>et al</I>., 1999). Thus, the
mutation in cyclin T1 provides a molecular explanation for why rodent
cells fail to support Tat-mediated transactivation even though
initiation from the HIV LTR is efficient in these cells.</P>

<P><B>Structure of the Tat protein and its cofactors</B></P>

<P>Despite extensive efforts, the crystals of HIV-1 Tat have not been
obtained. The best information about the three-dimensional structure
of Tat is based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) performed by
(Bayer <I>et al</I>., 1995; Klostermeier <I>et al</I>., 1997; Metzger
<I>et al</I>., 1997). These studies show that the Tat protein in
isolation is largely unfolded.</P>

<P>The Tat sequence has been subdivided into several distinct regions
on the basis of its amino acid composition: a N-terminal activation
region (amino acids 1&endash;19), a cysteine-rich role domain (amino
acids 20&endash;31), a core region (amino acids 32&endash;47), a
basic region (amino acids 48-57) and a glutamine-rich region (amino
acids 60&endash;76). Each of these regions is essential for Tat
function. The role of the cysteine-rich domain is unclear, although
it is believed to be involved in metal ion binding. The core, basic
and glutamine rich region are all involved in RNA binding. In
addition the basic region acts as a nuclear localisation signal. The
most ordered parts of Tat in the NMR structure are composed of the
core and glutamine-rich portions.</P>

<P>The structural basis for cyclin T1 interaction with Tat and TAR is
still unclear. The most recent models suggest that Cyclin T1 does not
bind to TAR directly, but it can alter the conformation of Tat to
permit it to recognize the apical loop sequence of TAR RNA in the
ternary complex. Cyclin T1 is believed to interact with Tat through
metal ions stabilized by essential cysteine residues found in both
proteins (Bieniasz <I>et al</I>., 1998; Garber <I>et al</I>., 1998b).
Since the cysteine-rich and basic regions of the free Tat protein are
highly flexible, it seems likely that they undergo conformational
rearrangements during assembly of the ternary complex with cyclin T1
and TAR RNA. High resolution structures for the CDK9 kinase are also
unavailable, however since CDK9 is highly homologous to the known
CDK2 kinase structure it is possible to build a reasonably accurate
model of the kinase domain. Clearly, a co-crystal structure of the
Tat/TAK/TAR complex is badly needed!</P>

<P><B>The HIV LTR is a "defective" promoter</B></P>

<P>Although most studies of the HIV-1 transactivation mechanism have
emphasised the role of Tat in stimulating transcription elongation, a
key, but poorly understood, feature of this novel regulatory system
is the ability of HIV-1 LTR to establish only non-processive (basal)
transcription in the absence of Tat.<BR>
Does TAR act as an attenuator sequence? Alternatively, are there
special features in the viral long terminal repeat that permit
initiation by defective transcription complexes?</P>

<P>Surprisingly, extensive mutagenesis of the HIV-1 LTR has failed to
identify any DNA elements that restrict elongation. If such an
element existed, it would have been possible to delete this element
and constitutively activate the HIV-1 LTR, however, all known
mutations in the HIV-1 LTR simply reduce transcription initiation
(Berkhout <I>et al</I>., 1990; Perkins <I>et al</I>., 1993; Rittner
<I>et al</I>., 1995). Furthermore, there is no evidence that TAR, or
any other downstream element acts as a specific attenuator sequence.
If this were the case, then deletion of TAR would be expected to
result in constitutively high expression of transcripts. Instead, TAR
can be entirely deleted without changing the pattern of HIV
transcription, provided that the normal transcription start site is
left intact (Rittner <I>et al</I>., 1995). Thus, the defect in
elongation appears to be an intrinsic feature of the promoter itself
rather than due to a specific negative regulatory element.</P>

<P>Although elongation from the HIV LTR is defective, the promoter is
able to initiate transcription very efficiently. In fact, the HIV LTR
is able to support higher levels of transcription in HeLa cell
extracts than either the adenovirus major late promoter or the CMV
immediate early promoter. One reason why the HIV LTR is so efficient
is that the core promoter, which includes all the elements required
for transcription in the cell free systems, is optimally designed for
cooperative binding by cellular transcription factors. The minimal
functional HIV promoter requires only three tandem SP1 binding sites
(Harrich <I>et al</I>., 1990; Jones <I>et al</I>., 1986), a TATA
element (Garcia <I>et al</I>., 1989; Jones <I>et al</I>., 1988; Olsen
&amp; Rosen, 1992) and an initiator sequence (Zenzie-Gregory <I>et
al</I>., 1993). Each of the core promoter elements participates in
the co-operative binding of the initiation factor TFIID, a
multi-subunit complex which contains the TATA binding protein, TBP,
and co-factors called TAFs (Verrijzer <I>et al</I>., 1994). The TAFs
can make direct contact with acidic activator proteins such as SP1
and the INR, while TBP recognises the TATA box.</P>

<P>The HIV-1 LTR can therefore be considered to be a "defective"
promoter that lacks essential elements found in cellular promoters
that promote elongation. Good candidates for this role are the
enhancer elements. To test this hypothesis, we introduced the IgH
enhancer into the HIV-1 LTR and showed that it is capable of
constitutively activating a high level of Tat-independent
transcription from the HIV-1 LTR in B-cells (West &amp; Karn, 1999).
In these experiments initiation levels in the presence or absence of
the IgH enhancer were equivalent but only the transcription complexes
that initiated in the presence of the enhancer were able to elongate
efficiently (West &amp; Karn, 1999). These results are consistent
with those of Berkhout <I>et al</I>., (1990) and Chang <I>et al</I>.,
(1993), who showed that the addition of either the SV40 or the CMV
enhancer to the HIV-1 LTR led to an increase in basal transcription
and a reduced Tat response.</P>

<P><B>Transactivation mechanism</B></P>

<P>As we have seen, Tat permits activation of an unstable RNA
polymerase that is engaged by the HIV core promoter. Because of its
intrinsic instability, the polymerase either pauses or falls off the
template soon after transcription through TAR unless Tat is present
in the cell. Our current understanding of the molecular basis for the
transactivation mechanism, based on the studies described above, is
outlined in Figure 3.</P>

<P>During transactivation the RNA polymerase CTD is phosphorylated
progressively by distinct enzymes. The kinase responsible for the
phosphorylation in the pre-initiation complex has been identified as
CDK7, which is a component of the TFIID initiation factor. Thus, in
common with many other promoters (Laybourn &amp; Dahmus, 1990;
Marshall <I>et al</I>., 1996; O'Brien <I>et al</I>., 1994), CTD
phosphorylation at the HIV LTR is an early rate-limiting step
associated with the clearance of the promoter that takes place prior
to the acquisition of Tat by the elongating polymerase.</P>

<P>Following clearance of the promoter, the phosphorylated polymerase
is then able to transcribe through the TAR region. During the
transcription of the TAR region, the TAR RNA stem-loop structure is
synthesized, and this creates a signal for Tat recruitment to the
transcription complex. The interaction between Tat and TAR not only
involves the binding of Tat to TAR RNA but also its association with
the protein kinase complex, TAK.</P>

<P>In the presence of Tat, the CDK9 kinase present in TAK becomes
constitutively activated. Since the loop region of TAR is required
for the formation of a ternary complex between Tat, TAR RNA and
cyclin T1, it seems likely that conformational changes in TAR RNA and
cyclin T1 which are associated with Tat binding, alter the
conformation of CDK9 and thereby activate the enzyme. Activation of
the CDK9 kinase, in turn leads to CTD hyperphosphorylation and the
creation of the II<SUB>o</SUB>* form of the RNA polymerase (Isel
&amp; Karn, 1999).</P>

<P>Modification of the transcription complex by Tat and TAK to make
it more processive may also require other protein phosphorylation
events in addition to the modification of the RNA polymerase CTD.
Purified TAK is able to auto-phosphorylate resulting in the
modification of both CDK9 and cyclin T1 (Mancebo <I>et al</I>., 1997;
Wei <I>et al</I>., 1998; Zhu <I>et al</I>., 1997). The
phosphorylation reaction also promotes the interactions between Tat,
TAK and TAR RNA (Fong &amp; Zhou, 2000; Garber <I>et al</I>., 2000;
Ivanov <I>et al</I>., 1999; Zhang <I>et al</I>., 2000). In addition,
Wada <I>et al</I>. (1998) have shown that TAK can be used to
reverse<BR>

<P>an early negative effect on transcription by the DRB-sensitivity
inducing factor (DSIF), which is composed of the transcription
factors Spt4 and Spt5. Spt5 is also an essential cofactor for
Tat-activated transcription (Ivanov <I>et al</I>., 2000; Wu-Baer
<I>et al</I>., 1998). Very recent studies have shown that Spt5 is
also a substrate of Tat-activated CDK9 (Kim &amp; Sharp, 2001; Ping
&amp; Rana, 2001). How all these phosphorylation events are
coordinated during transcription is the subject of much current
research.</P>

<P><B>Control of latency</B></P>

<P>In rapidly replicating cells HIV is transcribed almost
immediately. However, some infected T-cells subsequently enter
quiescence, with the result that the integrated proviral genome
enters a latent state where it can remain transcriptionally silent
until the cell receives a mitogenic signal. The ability to infect
cells latently helps HIV to establish persistent infections despite
strong immune responses against the viral proteins. When T-cells
residing in lymphoid tissues are activated, the latent proviruses
that they harbor can efficiently infect adjacent cells through
cell-to-cell transfer of virions (Grossman <I>et al</I>., 1998;
Pantaleo <I>et al</I>., 1993). It is extremely difficult for
antibodies to block this type of virus spread since free virus
particles, which can be efficiently targeted are not released.</P>

<P>A second consequence of latency during the development of HIV
disease is that the latent proviruses create a large and stable
reservoir of genetic variants from which strains carrying resistance
to immune responses and therapeutic drugs can be selected (Wei <I>et
al</I>., 1995). Although most studies of the HIV-1 transactivation
mechanism have emphasized the role of Tat in stimulating
transcription elongation, a key, but poorly understood, feature of
HIV growth is its ability to establish a latent infection where the
promoter is entirely shut down, and then reactivate transcription,
even in the absence of Tat.</P>

<P>What are there special features of the viral long terminal repeat
that permit promoter shutdown and reactivation? In addition to the
core promoter elements, described above, the HIV promoter contains
two NF-kB binding sites located near the transcription start site.
Studies using viral LTRs linked to reporter genes demonstrated that
the transcription factor NF-kB plays a central role in the proviral
activation pathway (Nabel &amp; Baltimore, 1987). In resting T-cells
and most established T cell lines, NF-kB is sequestered in the
cytoplasm by the inhibitor protein IkBa(for reviews, see Baeuerle
&amp; Henkel, 1994 and Baldwin, 1996). Following exposure of T-cells
to antigen, or treatment of the cells by mitogens such as phorbol
myristyl acetate (PMA) and phytohaemaglutinin (PHA), NF-kB is
unmasked due to the sequential phosphorylation, ubiquitination and
degredation of IkBa. Free NF-kB then translocates to the nucleus
where it can activate transcription from a wide variety of promoters,
including the HIV LTR (Nabel &amp; Baltimore, 1987; Perkins <I>et
al</I>., 1993).</P>

<P>Although the critical role played by NF-kB during the activation
of HIV transcription is well established, the precise molecular
mechanisms underlying its activity are still largely unknown. Most
models of HIV activation assume that the increased levels of NF-kB
exclusively stimulate initiation rates from the viral LTR. According
to these models, Tat is produced initially simply because the
promoter is "leaky" and a small fraction of the transcription
complexes are able to fortuitously produce full-length transcripts
(Marciniak &amp; Sharp, 1991). However, it seems more likely that
rather than relying on a stochastic process, specialized mechanisms
exist that ensure early Tat production.</P>

<P>Recent evidence from our laboratory (M. West and J. Karn,
unpublished) suggests that NF-kB acts to stimulate both transcription
initiation and, to a lesser degree, elongation (Figure 4). Following
integration into the host chromosome, the HIV-1 provirus is assembled
into chromatin, with nucleosomes that are positioned at precise
locations around the viral promoter (Sheridan <I>et al</I>., 1997;
Van Lint <I>et al</I>., 1996). The first nucleosome downstream of the
start site (Nuc-1) impedes transcription by occluding the initiation
site. There is strong evidence that Nuc-1 is disrupted following the
activation of HIV-1 transcription by TNF-a and PMA in transfected
T-cells and latently infected cell lines (Van Lint <I>et al</I>.,
1996). This modulation of the chromatin structure appears to be
mediated by recruitment of histone acetylases to the HIV LTR by
NF-kB. Consistent with this idea, the histone deacetylase inhibitor
Trichostatin A (TSA) can promote the hyperacetylation of histones and
activate HIV-1 transcription initiation (Sheridan <I>et al</I>.,
1997; Van Lint <I>et al</I>., 1996). </P>

<H6><B><I>Figure 4</I></B><I>. Activation of latent proviruses by
NF-kB and Tat during T-cell activation. (1) In unstimulated T-cells
cells the HIV-1 proviral DNA is assembled into chromatin with
precisely positioned nucleosomes surrounding the transcription start
site. (2) After stimulation of T-cells by mitogens, NF-kB binds to
its recognition sites in the LTR. NF-kB associates with a coactivator
complex containing histone acetylases. These chromatin remodelling
factors, leads to the disruption of Nuc-1 and the stimulation of
transcription initiation. In addition, NF-kB stimulates the activity
of a CTD kinase which catalyses the phosphorylation of the CTD of RNA
polymerase II at the promoter. This results in the stimulation of
transcriptional elongation. (3) Transcription from the activated LTR
leads an initial round of Tat synthesis. (4) Tat binds to the TAR RNA
element and further activates transcription by stimulating
elongation. </I></H6>

<P>Our new observation is that NF-kB can also influence transcription
elongation. RNase protection studies showed that the proportion of
total transcripts extending to distal regions of the template was
disproporationately increased following NF-kB expression. This
demonstrates that DNA elements present in the LTR can regulate
elongation and is consistent with our earlier observation that the
insertion of a cellular enhancer into the LTR led to the recruitment
of processive polymerases to this promoter and alleviated the
requirement for Tat (West &amp; Karn, 1999). One molecular mechanism
consistent with the ability of NF-kB to stimulate elongation is its
ability to stimulate phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase CTD at
certain promoters. Nissen &amp; Yamamoto, (2000) have shown that
NF-kB can stimulate the phosphorylation of the CTD of the RNA
polymerase II complexes assembled at the promoters of the IL-8 and
ICAM-1 promoters.</P>

<P>The synergistic activities of NF-kB and Tat to stimulate HIV
transcription acts as a "molecular switch" that allows HIV to make
the transition from a latent state to lytic growth. In HIV-2 and SIV
where only one NF-kB site is unusually present, additional regulatory
proteins with enhancer like activities are probably used to augment
early transcription. These cellular DNA-binding transcription factors
can act as rate limiting steps for initiation of transcription, but
ultimately, the rate of virus growth is moderated by the regulatory
proteins. If the LTR activity is too weak to allow the production of
necessary levels of Tat, or there are insufficient Tat levels to
allow the threshold production of the viral proteins, virus
replication will be aborted.</P>

<P><B>Extracellular Tat</B></P>

<P>In addition to playing its critical role as a transcription factor
there is a growing body of evidence that Tat might contribute to HIV
disease as an extracellular protein. Several groups have shown that
Tat can be secreted by infected cells (Ensoli <I>et al</I>., 1994;
Goldstein, 1996). Furthermore, extracellular Tat is readily taken up
by cells through interactions with heparin sulfate proteoglycans
displayed on the cell surface (Frankel &amp; Pabo, 1988; Tyagi <I>et
al</I>., 2001). Subsequently, Tat can reach their nucleus and then
activate a variety of cellular genes including cytokines such as
interlukin 6 (IL-6), IL-2 and tumor necrosis factor a (Ambrosino
<I>et al</I>., 1997; Nath <I>et al</I>., 1999) and the CXCR4 and CCR5
cytokine coreceptors for HIV infection (Huang <I>et al</I>., 1998).
Another potentially important target for exogenous Tat is the
vascular endothelium where it is able to induce angiogensis and
inflammation (Mitola <I>et al</I>., 2000; Rubartelli <I>et al</I>.,
1998). Thus, there are many opportunities for Tat to act as a
contributor to HIV pathogenesis in an autocrine or paracrine
fashion.</P>

<P>Most of the effects of extracellular Tat have been observed in
tissue culture cells exposed to recombinant Tat. Unfortunately, it is
still not clear whether enough Tat is released during HIV infections
to produce analogous effects <I>in vivo</I>. Some years ago, we
tested a series of T-cell lines that constitutively expressed Tat
introduced via a retroviral vector. Although these cells expressed
many times the level of Tat that was required for transactivation,
Tat was not released into the medium unless there was apoptosis.
Until direct evidence from studies using animal models becomes
available, it will remain uncertain whether extracellular Tat plays
an important role in the development of HIV disease.</P>

<P><B>Novel targets for drug discovery</B></P>

<P>Current anti-viral treatment for HIV infections is restricted to
inhibitors of reverse transcriptase and/or the viral protease.
Although the available drugs effectively reduce the levels of rapidly
replicating virus, the benefit is only short-term because of clinical
side effects and the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Most
resistance mutants that are detected in clinical trials pre-exist in
HIV infected individuals, but because these mutations reduce virus
growth rates, they will only emerge as dominant strains during drug
treatment. Although multiple-drug combination therapy leads to the
virtual removal of virus from the peripheral circulation, its
efficiency in preventing resistance over long periods of treatment
remains to be proven. A second problem in current HIV chemotherapy
this that even when most viral replication is inhibited, the
population of latently infected cells remains unaffected. Stimulation
of these cells by cytokines produces viruses that rapidly repopulate
the body once therapy is interrupted (Embretson <I>et al</I>., 1993;
Ho <I>et al</I>., 1995; Pantaleo <I>et al</I>., 1993; Temin &amp;
Bolognesi, 1993; Wei <I>et al</I>., 1995).</P>

<P>The complex mechanism regulating transcription of the HIV genome
provide particularly attractive targets for anti-viral development
since regulated transcription of HIV is required not only during the
exponential growth of the virus, but also critically, during the
activation of the integrated proviral genomes that give rise to the
drug-resistant strains. Now that molecular studies of the activation
of transcription by Tat and its cellular co-factors are nearing
completion, there is renewed interest in finding drugs that
selectively inhibit these processes. The search for drugs that can
block transactivation started several years ago using a variety of
cellular and in vitro screens.</P>

<P>The best known HIV transcription antagonists were a pair of
benzyldiazepine discovered at Roche, called Ro5-3335 and Ro24-7429
(Cupelli &amp; Hsu, 1995; Hsu <I>et al</I>., 1991). Detailed analysis
of HIV-1 transcription using nuclear run on assays has shown that
these compounds inhibit the initiation of HIV transcription but do
not specifically interfere with Tat (Cupelli &amp; Hsu, 1995).
Ro24-7429 is the only transcription inhibitor to have progressed into
Phase I clinical trials. Unfortunately, these trials were abandoned
due to side effects of the drug on the central nervous system before
antiviral activity in patients could be demonstrated. One
contributing factor to the lack of antiviral activity may have been
extensive binding of the drug to human plasma proteins (Cupelli &amp;
Hsu, 1995).</P>

<P>Several protein kinase C inhibitors have been shown to inhibit HIV
LTR-driven gene expression by reducing NF-kB availability (Jakobovits
<I>et al</I>., 1990). One of the most potent of these compounds is
pentoxifylline (PTX) (Mhashilkar <I>et al</I>., 1997). Unfortunately,
pentoxifylline inhibition of HIV is restricted to certain cell types
and in clinical trials there is was no evidence found that the viral
loads in patients treated with pentoxifylline were reduced (Dezube
&amp; Lederman, 1995).</P>

<P>The most selective inhibitors of HIV replication currently known
are the fluoroquinolones such as K12 and K37 (Baba <I>et al</I>.,
1998; Baba <I>et al</I>., 1997; Witvrouw <I>et al</I>., 1998). Unlike
the Roche compounds, the fluoroquinolones appear to directly target a
step in transactivation and are potent inhibitors of Tat-activated
transcription under conditions where CMV transcription and basal
transcription from the HIV LTR are unaffected. Unfortunately,
although these compounds inhibit a broad range of viruses they are
also cytotoxic and exhibit a narrow selectivity index. Until the
molecular targets for these interesting drugs is identified, and the
selectivity index improved, it is difficult to see how they can be
progressed further.</P>

<P>A more selective approach is to identify protein kinases
inhibitors that selectively inhibit CDK9 (TAK). It has been known for
many years that protein kinase inhibitors such as DRB can selectively
inhibit Tat-mediated transcription elongation (Marciniak &amp; Sharp,
1991). The first successful screen for inhibitors of TAK was reported
by Mancebo <I>et al</I>. who have used a screen of over 100,000
compounds in a Tat-dependent in vitro transcription assay to discover
a diverse set of protein kinase inhibitors (Mancebo <I>et al</I>.,
1997). Although TAK kinase inhibitors can effectively block HIV
replication, it should be borne in mind that each of these compounds
is also cytotoxic because TAK is also required for cellular
transcriptional control (Chao <I>et al</I>., 2000; Flores <I>et
al</I>., 1999). Once again, until the potency and selectivity indexes
of these compounds are increased it is unlikely that these types of
inhibitors can progress to development.</P>

<P>Finally, it may be possible to select small molecules that inhibit
the Tat/TAR interaction. Using a combinatorial approach (Hamy <I>et
al</I>., 1997) were able to identify a peptidic compound, CGP64222,
that is able to effectively compete with Tat binding for TAR RNA and
inhibit HIV replication. NMR analysis shows that CGP64222 binds
directly to TAR RNA at the Tat binding site. Thus, CGP64222 is the
first example of an antiviral compound that selectively inhibits a
RNA-protein interaction. In later developments some promising
non-peptidic inhibitors of the Tat-TAR interaction were also
uncovered (Hamy <I>et al</I>., 1998; Mei <I>et al</I>., 1997).</P>

<P><B>Conclusions</B></P>

<P>The central role played by Tat in HIV replication has made it a
focus of attention ever since its discovery in 1985. Tat provides the
first example of a protein that regulates transcriptional elongation
in eukaryotic cells, and until Tat was discovered, elongation control
was a relatively neglected area of transcription regulation. Although
there is still a great deal of ignorance about the mode of action of
the key elongation factors, the identification of CDK9, cyclin T1 and
Spt5 as critical components of the Tat-dependent elongation mechanism
has also revealed their importance in the normal cellular
transcription.</P>

<P>Studies of the interactions of Tat with TAR RNA have also provided
new insights into the chemistry of nucleic acid recognition. There
are many examples of RNA binding proteins that recognise bases
displayed in apical loop and distorted bulge structures. Studies of
the Tat-TAR interaction have revealed that the binding reaction
involves both a conformational changes in RNA structure that provides
much of selectivity for molecular recognition.</P>

<P>Finally, studies of HIV transactivation are providing a strong
molecular basis for drug discovery. Several groups have identified
promising "hits" that inhibit HIV replication by interfering with
Tat, TAR and cellular cofactors required for HIV transcription. As
structural data on these molecular targets becomes available, further
development of these compounds will become possible using modern
structure-based design. I am optimistic that these existing early
leads can be developed into drugs that will make a useful
contribution to the treatment of AIDS.</P>
