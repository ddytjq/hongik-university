<p><font face="Times New Roman">The Vredestein-Gazelle Team has arrived in Beijing, China. The flight was
o.k.and on the airport the Organization Committee of the Tour de China was
waiting&nbsp; to welcome us. First there was a problem to get our bicycles
through customs, but showing some important looking faxes convinced the
officials that there was no problem.
After putting our bicycles together, we trained for 4 hours through the city
of Beijing. We made a little criterium race in the Tianamin, the famous square
in the middle of Beijing, with just 5 participants. Nathan Dahlberg will arrive in two
days.
Today we trained for 6 hours, went out of town and tested our legs on the
hills northwest of Beijing. Most of the guys look strong and are in
top-shape so we look forward to the start of the Tour de China. We make sure we
are out riding a lot, so that we are tired in the evenening and everybody sleeps
well. The intensity of the training is low, we start training shorter and more
intensive towards the race. This turned out the best way for us to get used to
the time difference (6 hours), when we have only few days before the race. This
may not be the mainstream theory though...<br>
The opening ceremony on Sunday will be on the Tianamen, wich is the center
of the town, it will be impressive to be the middle point of Beijing for
a while.<br>
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Dennis Hammink: <i>&quot;The traffic is a total
chaos; cars, busses, riksja's, pedestrians and of course thousands of bicycles,
everything going criss-cross. And we slalom around everything, because we are
faster then the other traffic. On the main roads we can catch the draft from
cars and busses. Perfect training for the speed.&quot;&nbsp;</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Anno Pedersen: <i>&quot;Beijing is a huge city. We
need over 1,5 hour by bicycle only to get out of the city. But after that it is
great training in the mountains, good roads and almost no traffic.&quot;</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Joost Legtenberg: <i>&quot;During a training,
still in the city we saw a beautiful arch with big sculptures and we stopped to
make a photo. Immediatly three security men showed up who sent us away. Later we
found out that this was the working place of the president of China.&quot;</i></font></p>
<p><b>September 2nd:</b></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">We're in the middle of the organised chaos of leaving for the opening
ceremony. This will be a gigantic event on the Tiananmen Square. The
organisation expacts a lot of people watching, they have 1500 policement to
close the roads!! There will be a demonstration race, which does not count for
the Tour, but we want to win the first cycling event on Tiananmen Square!!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">
Remko Kramer: <i>&quot;Before the caravan with busses for the riders, trucks and
teamcars left the hotel everything looked like a complete chaos. But after
leaving it turned out to be perfectly organized. The 2nd ringroad and the main
road to the Tiananmen were completely empty, normally there are traffic jams on
these roads. All traffic was shut down for the Tour de China. At that moment you
get great respect for the organization of this event.&quot;</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Atmosphere in the team is perfect and motivation
strong. Nathan had a cold,
but feels good again, 6 hours on the bike yesterday.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The openingceremonie on the Tiananmen was overwhelming, thousands of people by the side of the roads
and also thousands of policemen to shut down the roads and clear the inner ring
of Beijing (!).&nbsp;</font></p>

The VIP's behind tables in front of a huge building. Lots of fotographers and
some camera teams were walking around. Later we saw ourselves in the news and in

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Roger van der Borgh: <i>&quot;After the
openingceremonie everybody took part in a openingrace. One lap around Tiananmen,
without warming-up, that is no problem for me. The chinese went from the gun, we
were going over 50 kph all the time. In the last turn I went with Joost
Legtenberg to the outside, the road is 8 lanes wide, Nobody caught us before the
line. Great to become the winner of the first cycling race on the Tiananmen.&quot;</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">After the opening of the event we were transported to
Changping. The ringroad and Badaling Expressway were closed for all other
traffic, thousands of policemen controlled the traffic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Criterium: vd Borgh superstrong again attacking and
controlling. Legtenberg
wins the point-sprints. With 35 km to go, Dahlberg attacks with Lavrenko (Kaz).
Vredestein-Gazelle controls the field and by the finish of the race Lavrenko and
Dahlberg gained 1.01 minute. Lavrenko wins the stage (decided by photo-finish)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Dennis crashed, but did a good race, became 6th, Joost 7th.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Dennis Hammink: <i>&quot;For the pointsprint I
did a lead out for Joost and sprinted and won points myself as well. So I really
went deep, I looked around to check the peloton and hit the rearwheel of the
rider in front of me. I crashed going 50 kph, my but was rasped, but the race
goes on. So I went back on my bicycle and caught back on.&quot;</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Remko Kramer: <i>&quot;With 3 k to go a Kazach
attacked. Roger had to go maximal to catch him back. After that he took the lead,
but we had one less to pull the sprint. Then we were surprised on the left side
by a fast group coming through.&quot;</i></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman">In the
last stage of the Tour de China, Nathan Dahlberg lost his second place in the GC.
He had bad luck in this 211 km stage, with a lot of climbing, a number of times
from sea-level to 800 meters. As promised below, it became a though day, but
Dahlberg flatted on a crucial moment and had to do with a third place overall.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman">Because
we were still in the running for different prizes, we had to play it clever on
the last day. Remko and Roger would attack in the first, flat, 80 kilometers, to
make sure that the Kazachs had to work from the beginning. Roger attacked
from the gun, started pushing the 12 within 500 meters and went up the ‘false
flat’ with 50 km/hour. Later in the race, he did get over 5 minutes, together
with a Mongol rider and the Kazach team had to work.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Roger van der Borgh: <i>&quot;Today
it was my job to exhaust the Kazachs before the mountains. I did what I could.
First they were using lots of energy to react on my attacks. When they had
enough of that I could get away with a Mongolian rider. We gained over 5 minutes,
the Kazachs had to work to catch us back. When they caught me I was done.&quot;</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><font face="Times New Roman">Joost,
Dennis, Anno and finally Nathan had to finish the Kazach team. But it turned out
to be different… The Kazachs were superstrong in the mountains (with
spectacular views, for instance over the Chinese wall). Joost tried to attack,
but he had no chance. After a points sprint on a 12 km climb, the Kazachstans
attacked with three riders at once. Dahlberg had participated in the sprint and
couldn’t react straight away. Four Vredestein-Gazelle riders were with him
still and they started chasing the Kazachstans. When the difference went back to
less than half a minute, everything seemed to be under control again, but that
was the moment that Dahlberg flatted. When he came back, the difference was
almost three minutes and Vredestein-Gazelle riders had to work like crazy to
keep Dahlberg with the first three in the GC! It was a pity that the team had to
hammer until the finish because Hammink had great legs today and Legtenberg
recovered very well. Otherwise they could have tried for a stage result.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Nathan Dahlberg: <i>&quot;On
the second big climb there was a points sprint half-way. I sprinted and won some
points. We had a gap to the rest of the field, I saw 4 Kazachs around me. Three
of them attacked and I could not go with them. With the other guys of the team
we started chasing and then I flatted, that's cycling, anything can
happen.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></font></p>

results. It became really fun when the Mongol wodka with horse milk !? was brought
in… With riders and staff from Kazachstan, Mongolia, Hong Kong, Japan and
China of course, it became a great evening.</span></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">After the event we stayed for a couple of days
in Beijing. To recover from the hard race. The first days of the race were hot (around
30 degrees celsius) and very humid. Later it was cooler (around 25 degrees) with
sunshine and a clear sky. From the city we could even see the mountains.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Remko Kramer: <i>&quot;China is a very
impressive country with an interesting culture. Everything is so different from
what we are used to. It is great to experience this country by bicycle.&quot;&nbsp;</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">We did some easy training and visited tourist
sights, like the Forbidden city and the Tiantan park with the temple of heaven.
On markets we bought souvenirs to bring home. We tasted the famous Beijing Duck
in a restaurant. September 10th a part of the team flew back to Holland. The
others will fly to Japan on the 13th to participate in the <a href="hokkaido2000.htm"><font color="#0000FF">Tour
