          A. Yes! It is the stated mission of Biology Education Online &quot;to 
          publish to the World Wide Web new, interactive, participatory resources 
          that exemplify the multimedia capabilities inherent in the Internet 
          for the advancement of teaching and learning science.&quot;...We are 
          hoping that our users will submit some! We would be delighted include 
          quality, scientifically accurate, multi-media resources like the one 
          suggested.<br>

        <li><b>Q. <a name="ftp"></a>I would have submitted an activity I wrote, 
          but I cannot use the ftp thing, how can I submit my activity to you?</b><br>
          A. Please <a href="mailto:%20beon@accessexcellence.org">contact us</a> 
          at beon@accessexcellence.org and we will make other arrangements for 
          uploading your work. (For example, you can email it to us or we can 
          work with you so you can do the upload yourself.)<br>

          them for Phase One and then don't choose to edit them according to any 
          of the suggestions or peer review responses?</b><br>
          A. If you choose not to edit your material so that it meets the standards 
          set for inclusion in BEoN, the material will be removed from BEoN. However, 
          you may choose to submit it for publication in the Activities-to-Go 
          section forum of Access Excellence or to be included it in the &quot;Linked 
          Lessons&quot; section of this web site. <br>

        <li><b>Q. <a name="anon"></a>Why do you post materials in Phase One and 
          Phase Two without the author's name?</b><br>
          A. We post materials and reviews anonymously so that the material will 
          be reviewed on its merits without distractions and modifications based 
          on the name or credentials of the author(s). The BEoN rubric publicly 
          states the qualities by which submissions will be rated. BEoN is one 
          of the very few portals to the National Science Digital Library for 
          educators who are not affiliated with professional scientific organizations. 
          We welcome all quality submissions. <br>

          anonymously, how can I be sure that someone won't copy them and submit 
          them to another journal or publication as their own material?</b><br>
          A. Copyright law says that you own your work and that others need permission 
          to use it. BEoN Phase One and Phase Two submissions are now framed with 
          a BEoN logo and copyright policy statements to better protect you. (You 
          retain the copyright until your work is accepted for publication in 
          BEoN, at that time, like all professional journals, the journal becomes 
          the copyright owner.) <br>

        <li><b>Q. <a name="rubric"></a>Can we use the rubric in our professional 
          development workshops at our high school? How was the rubric developed?</b><br>
          A. We encourage the use of our online rubric for pre-service and in-service 
          professional development. The interactive, online rubric was developed 
          with input from K-16 educators, members of NABT, and members of the 
          Access Excellence community. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>

        <li><b>Q. <a name="p2reviewers"></a>Who are the&quot;invited experts&quot;, 
          cited as Phase Two reviewers? </b><br>
          A. Phase Two reviewers are 'invited' because of their expertise in the 
          subject matter of the material and the pedagogy of the grade level for 
          which the material was written. Many of the expert reviewers are from 
          NABT. Other reviewers are research science volunteers. Still other reviewers 
          are educators who indicated their willingness to review when we were 
          developing the rubric and subsequently sent along their &quot;bona fides&quot; 
          to be added to the Phase Two Review Panels. Would you like to volunteer? 
          Send an email to beon@accessexcellence.org with the subject: Phase 2 
          Reviewer :) Thank you. <br>

        <li><b>Q. <a name="k16"></a>Your e-journal says that it's for K-16 educators.....where 
          are the K-3 and 12-16 materials?</b><br>
          A. We are actively soliciting materials from all levels. If you have, 
          or know someone who has, original, quality, life science or biology 
          education resources, please consider submitting to BEoN for review. 
          <br>

        </li>
        <li><b>Q. <a name="looks"></a>Why do the materials submitted in Phase 
          One look so &quot;unprofessional&quot;.</b><br>
          A.We have encouraged educators and other subject matter developers to 
          submit materials that they have created in the hopes that their 'peers' 
          would use the rubric to review them and to make comments that would 
          help to make the materials more useful for all educators. While we have 
          specifically labeled Phase I submissions &quot;drafts&quot;, submissions 
          should be more developed than &quot;rough drafts&quot;. Quality formatting 
          can (and will) be part of preparation for the invited review and for 
          publication in BEoN. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          <a href="#top"><font size="-2">back to top</font></a> <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Q. <a name="formats"></a>Why are there so many different formats? 
          How can we tell what Standards are met by an activity? How do we know 
          what materials we need and where to get them?</b><br>
          A. Although BEoN is not requiring a standard format, this information 
          is included in the submission, where appropriate. As the National Science 
          Digital Library makes decisions regarding format, we will include that 
          in our protocols. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>

        </li>
        <li><b>Q. <a name="browse"></a>Why does 'Browse' send me back to the Phase 
          One Review page?</b><br>
          A. As the BEoN collection grows, the Browse feature will take you to 
          an index of submissions. Until that time, we are sending visitors interested 
          in browsing to the Phase One Review page because it is there that you 
          can (at this time) browse all BEoN submissions. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          <a href="#top"><font size="-2">back to top</font></a> <br>

        </li>
        <li><b>Q. <a name="linkedlessons"></a>What if I have some materials on 
          my own web site that I want to share, but I don't want to go through 
          the review process or be considered for publication in BEoN. All I want 
          to do is share my URL.</b><br>
          A, Our &quot;Linked Lessons&quot; has been set up for this purpose. 
          However, for longevity and credibility purposes, we would encourage 
          you to submit these items for publication in BEoN. People change servers, 
          links get broken and teachers retire. BEoN is a way for your work to 
          be acknowledged and for you to receive the credit for what you have 
          accomplished in a much more permanent way. <br>
