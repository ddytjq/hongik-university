    the track surface is upgraded proved an entertaining day for those who braved the
    changeable winter weather. Three local young stallions were paraded during the day. These
    were the recently retired Happy Giggle who will stand at Lakewood Stud, Devaraja who has
    his first 2yos racing and winning during the current season and Akhadan with the latter
    two standing at Oakside Park. Today also marked the retirement of local jockey Peter
    Shepherd who had his last race ride in Race 7 aboard Tapalinga.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>

    at an earlier fence moved to second with Voodoo Sunset next then Ryazan and See Reason
    with a break to Paisano. Over the jump at the 800m Prince Keystone kicked clear from
    Voodoo Sunset as Paisano moved to third from See Reason. On straightening Paisano hit the
    front from Prince Keystone with Voodoo Sunset between them and a gap to the others. Coming
    to the last Paisano ran out then started to drift in after the jump at Prince Keystone
    with Voodoo Sunset raising another effort behind them. Prince Keystone fought back on the
    rails to grab the lead inside the final 70m and continued his run to win by a half length
