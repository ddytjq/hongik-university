<H1>Neutrinos as Dark Matter</H1>

<P>
Neutrinos are very weakly interacting, electrically neutral particles
that are involved in nuclear interactions where protons and changed
into neutrons or vice versa, and in other reactions as well.  
An example of a weak nuclear interaction involving a neutrino is
the free neutron decay
<PRE>
neutron --> proton + electron + anti-neutrino
</PRE>
This decay has a mean life of 887 seconds or a half life of 10.25 minutes.
The cross
section for a typical interaction involving a neutrino is
5*10<SUP>-44</SUP> (E/[1 MeV])<SUP>2</SUP> cm<SUP>2</SUP>
which is very small when compared to the Thomson scattering cross section
of 7*10<SUP>-25</SUP> cm<SUP>2</SUP>.
Thus a 1 MeV neutrino could travel through about 35 light years of water
before interacting.
Even with this very small probability of interactions, neutrinos have
been detected coming from nuclear reactors, the Sun, and from supernova
1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud.
Experiments show that the neutrinos produced in muon interactions are 
different from the neutrinos involved in interactions with electrons.
A third kind of particle, the tau, appears to be a heavier version of
the muon which is itself a heavier version of the electron.  It is assumed
to have its own kind of neutrino as well.  Thus there are 3 kinds of
neutrinos: the electron neutrino, the muon neutrino, and the tau neutrino.
Each kind has an anti-particle as well.  The electron neutrino is known
to have a mass at least 50,000 times smaller than the mass of the
electron, and neutrinos are often assumed to be massless - which means
zero rest mass.
</P>

<P>
Because the Universe was once so hot and dense that even neutrinos interacted
many times during the Hubble time 1/H, there once was a thermal background
of neutrinos in equilibrium with the thermal background of photons that is
the CMBR.  But since neutrino interactions are so weak, this thermal 
equilibrium only survived until 1 second after the Big Bang.
But the neutrino background is still present today, with about
56 electron neutrinos, 56 electron anti-neutrinos, 56 muon neutrinos,
etc., per cubic centimeter, for a total of 337 neutrinos per cubic
centimeter in the Universe.  The photons of the CMBR are slightly more
numerous with 411 photons/cc.

<A NAME="mass">

<H2>Measuring the Neutrino Mass</H2>

<P>
Because the number of neutrinos in the Universe is so large, even a very
small neutrino mass can have drastic consequences for cosmology.  So
experiments to measure the neutrino mass are obviously very significant.
There are three ways to detect a neutrino mass:
<UL>
<LI>The energy spectrum of the observable electrons in a radioactive
beta decay is modified if the electron neutrino has a non-zero mass.
The unseen neutrinos are emitted uniformly in momentum, but for a
massive neutrino the change in energy for momenta up to about 0.5*m*c
is small, so a relatively large number of electrons are emitted at close to 
the maximum energy.  
This leads to a large number of electrons being emitted at just below
the maximum possible energy, and thus an abrupt decline to zero at the
maximum possible energy.
For zero rest mass, the number of electrons per unit
energy declines at a constant slope to zero at the maximum energy.
What is actually seen is a smooth transition from zero to a constant
slope instead of the "cliff" expected for non-zero mass, so only an upper
limit of several eV is obtained for the mass of the electron neutrino.
Radioactive decays producing muon and tau neutrinos are very hard to
observe, so this method gives very weak limits on their masses.

<LI>Time-of-flight data can be used to detect the fact that massive
neutrinos travel slightly slower than the speed of light.
The speed is given by
<PRE>
v/c = sqrt[1-(mc<SUP>2</SUP>/E)<SUP>2</SUP>] = 1 - 0.5*(mc<SUP>2</SUP>/E)<SUP>2</SUP> + ...
</PRE>
which leads to an arrival time difference of
<PRE>
Dt = (L/c)*0.5*(mc<SUP>2</SUP>/E)<SUP>2</SUP>
</PRE>
Since Dt &lt; 10 seconds with (L/c) = 5*10<SUP>12</SUP> seconds for
10 MeV neutrinos from SN1987A in the LMC, the mass is less than 20 eV.
All the detected neutrinos from SN1987A were electron neutrinos, so this
limit only applies to one of the three types.  The 
<A HREF="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca">Sudbury Neutrino
Observatory (SNO)</A> will be able to detect all three types of neutrinos,
and if we are lucky enough to have a nearby supernova SNO may be able to
improve the limits on the muon and tau neutrinos.

<LI>Neutrino oscillations: quantum mechanics says that the wavefunction
for any particle oscillates at a frequency of mc<SUP>2</SUP>/h cycles
per second, <EM>in the rest frame of the particle.</EM>  Relativity says
that a particle sees a time interval in its rest frame that is
smaller by the factor (mc<SUP>2</SUP>/E) than the
lab frame time interval due to time dilation.  Thus the effective lab
frame oscillation frequency of a particle is
[mc<SUP>2</SUP>]<SUP>2</SUP>/[Eh]
and the <EM>beat frequency</EM> between two particles of different
masses is 
<PRE>
Df = [c<SUP>4</SUP>/Eh]*[m<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>2</SUP>-m<SUB>1</SUB><SUP>2</SUP>]
</PRE>
which is 2.7 kHz for m<SUB>1</SUB> = 0, m<SUB>2</SUB>c<SUP>2</SUP> = 0.1
eV, and E = 1 GeV.  Since it takes 40 msec for neutrinos to
travel through the Earth, many cycles of the beat frequency can occur
and the neutrinos become a mixture of types when traveling through the
Earth.
</UL>
The cosmological effects of the neutrino mass would be obvious if the
sum of the masses of the three types were larger than 40 eV, so this
gives a limit on all three types.

<H2>Technical Discussion of the Neutrino Background</H2>

<P>
At the time of weak decoupling, about 1 second after the Big Bang,
the neutrinos and the photon-electron-positron plasma had the
same temperature, which I will call T<SUB>n</SUB>.  All these particles
were relativistic since k*T<SUB>n</SUB> &gt; 1 MeV, where k is the Boltzmann
constant.  The energy of a relativistic plasma occupying a
volume a<SUP>3</SUP> ("a" will be the scale factor of the Universe) is
<PRE>
Q = (2\sigma/c)(g<SUB>b</SUB>+(7/8)g<SUB>f</SUB>)a<SUP>3</SUP> T<SUP>4</SUP>
</PRE>
where \sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, c is the speed of
light, and g<SUB>b</SUB> and g<SUB>f</SUB>
are the number of spin degrees of freedom
for bosons (integral spin particles) and fermions (half-integral
spin particles).  For photons g<SUB>b</SUB> = 2, since even though the
spin is 1, there are only 2 spin states instead of 2*Spin+1,
because the longitudinal EM mode doesn't propagate.  For 
neutrinos g<SUB>f</SUB> = 1, even though the spin is 1/2, because one
of the helicity states doesn't exist.  Finally for electrons
with spin of 1/2, g<SUB>f</SUB> is 2 and for positrons g<SUB>f</SUB> is 2.
</P>

<P>
Thus the photon-electron-positron plasma has
<PRE>
Q = (4\sigma/c)(1 + 7/4) a<SUP>3</SUP> T<SUP>4</SUP>
</PRE>
As the Universe expands and cools adiabatically the
entropy in the volume a<SUP>3</SUP> is conserved.  Since the
photon-electron-positron plasma has decoupled from
the neutrinos its entropy is separately conserved.
The entropy can be found by a thought experiment of
heating the volume from 0 to T and using
<PRE>
dS = dQ/T
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
S = (4\sigma/c)(1 + 7/4) a<SUP>3</SUP> \int 4 T<SUP>2</SUP> dT
</PRE>
giving
<PRE>
S = (4/3)(4\sigma/c)(1 + 7/4) a<SUP>3</SUP> T<SUP>3</SUP>
</PRE>
In the absence of annihilation conservation of entropy
gives aT = constant.
</P>

<P>
During the period from 1 second after the Big Bang until 
3 minutes after the Big Bang the temperature falls to 
well below the rest mass of the electron.  Thus the
electron-positron plasma annihilates and transfers
its energy and entropy to the photons.  This leaves
the photons with a temperature T<SUB>p</SUB> that is larger
than the neutrino temperature T<SUB>n</SUB>.  Energy is
not conserved in an adiabatically expanding gas
because the pressure of the gas does external work, 
but the entropy is conserved.  Thus the entropy
before from photons and electron-positron pairs,
<PRE>
(4/3)(4\sigma/c)(1 + 7/4) a<SUP>3</SUP> T<SUB>n</SUB><SUP>3</SUP>,
</PRE>
 is equal to the entropy afterward just from photons, 
<PRE>
(4/3)(4\sigma/c) a<SUP>3</SUP> T<SUB>p</SUB><SUP>3</SUP>,
</PRE>
so 
<PRE>
T<SUB>n</SUB>/T<SUB>p</SUB> = (4/11)<SUP>1/3</SUP>.
</PRE>
The photon temperature now is T<SUB>p</SUB> = 2.728 K and the neutrino
temperature now is 1.947 K.
</P>

<P>
If neutrinos are massless then we can compute their
equivalent mass density using
<PRE>
rho = [Q/a<SUP>3</SUP>]/c<SUP>2</SUP> = N<SUB>n</SUB> (2\sigma/c)(7/8)g<SUB>f</SUB> T<SUB>n</SUB><SUP>4</SUP>
</PRE>
where N<SUB>n</SUB> is the number of neutrino species: N<SUB>n</SUB> = 6 for
3 types of neutrinos and 3 types of anti-neutrinos.
This density works out to be very small compared to the
critical density.  It is 0.5*[N<SUB>n</SUB>*7/8](4/11)<SUP>4/3</SUP> = 0.68
times the equivalent mass density of the photons and 
only 3*10<SUP>-34</SUP> grams per cubic centimeter.
</P>

<P>
Even though this density is negligible now, it was significant during the
time that helium was formed during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.  The increased
density due to the neutrino background during helium synthesis caused the
universe to expand faster, and this reduced the time required for the
temperature to fall to the point where deuterium could survive.  As a result
the helium abundance is a few percent larger than it would have been without
the neutrino background.
</P>

<P>
If the neutrinos are not massless, then they could have
a larger mass density now consisting of their number
density times their rest mass.  Each neutrino species
has a number density of
<PRE>
n = (3/4)(4\pi)\Gamma(3)\zeta(3) (kT<SUB>n</SUB>/hc)<SUP>3</SUP>
</PRE>
where \Gamma is the gamma function (\Gamma(n+1) = n!
so \Gamma(3) = 2), \zeta is the zeta function 
<PRE>
\zeta(s) = 1 + 1/2<SUP>s</SUP> + 1/3<SUP>s</SUP> + ... and \zeta(3) = 1.202...
</PRE>
With T<SUB>n</SUB> = 1.947 K now the number density of each neutrino
species is 56 per cubic cm.  This is just (3/22) times the
number density of photons at T<SUB>p</SUB>.  With N<SUB>n</SUB> = 6 species the
total number density of neutrinos is 336 per cc.  The
mass density for massive neutrinos is then
<PRE>
rho = 112*(m<SUB>n-e</SUB> + m<SUB>n-mu</SUB> + m<SUB>n-tau</SUB>)
</PRE>
where m<SUB>n-e</SUB> is the mass of the electron neutrino (and electron
anti-neutrino since anti-particles have the same mass as the
corresponding particle), m<SUB>n-mu</SUB> is mass of the muon neutrino, and
m<SUB>n-tau</SUB> is the mass of the tau neutrino.  For masses in electron
Volts this is
<PRE>
rho = 2*10<SUP>-31</SUP>(m<SUB>n-e</SUB> + m<SUB>n-mu</SUB> + m<SUB>n-tau</SUB>) gm/cc
</PRE>
compared to the critical density of 8*10<SUP>-30</SUP> gm/cc for
H<SUB>o</SUB> = 65.
</P>

<P>
Thus a neutrino rest mass of 40 eV for one type would give
the critical density in neutrinos, and a rest mass of 10 eV
for one type or a sum of rest masses of 10 eV would be a
significant factor in the formation of large scale structures
in the Universe such as clusters and superclusters of galaxies.
</P>

<P>
For these masses the neutrinos are traveling slowly now but
their thermal velocities were large in the past.  The typical
momentum of a relativistic particle in a thermal distribution
is p = 3kT/c, and the product of the scale factor and the
momentum, ap, is a constant.  Thus neutrinos with rest mass m will
be moving at redshift z with a typical velocity
<PRE>
v = pc/sqrt[p<SUP>2</SUP> + (mc)<SUP>2</SUP>] = 3(1+z)k(1.947 K)/mc - ...
</PRE>
and the distance traveled, measured now (the comoving distance), is
<PRE>
D = \int (1+z) v dt = 2(c/H<SUB>o</SUB>) sqrt(3*k*(1.947 K))/mc<SUP>2</SUP>) + ...
</PRE>
which gives D = 100 Mpc for mc<SUP>2</SUP> = 5 eV in a critical density
model with H<SUB>o</SUB> = 65.  Thus neutrinos can free
stream out of the perturbations that make galaxies and cluster of galaxies,
but will remain in the perturbations that make superclusters.  Because
this behavior is caused by the thermal velocity of the neutrinos, this
form of dark matter is called <EM>Hot Dark Matter</EM>.
