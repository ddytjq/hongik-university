  THE ACCOUNT<br></b></font>
  The Falcon 120 account has been designed to offer higher rates of interest to savers with lump sums, but with the flexibility of gaining access to your savings should the need arise. Penalty free withdrawals are possible and the account is structured to offer tiered interest levels. Falcon 120 also offers an attractive monthly income option for those wishing to take a regular income from their savings.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>AVAILABILITY</b></font>
  <br>
  This account is available to all UK residents.
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>HOW TO OPEN YOUR ACCOUNT</b></font>
  <br>
  Your Falcon 120 account can be opened at any Society Branch or Agency. If you are a new investor with the Society you will be asked to provide one form of peronal identification and another for address verification. A list of the acceptable items is displayed in all Branches and Agencies and a copy will be made available on request. All requests for identification are standard and conform to regulations which protect you as the Customer and guard against fraudulent transactions.
  <br><br>
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>MINIMUM INITAL INVESTMENT</b></font>
  <br>
  The minimum initial investment required to open a Falcon 120 account where annual interest would be required is £5,000. Where the monthly income option is required the minimum amount rises to £10,000. In both cases there is a maximum holding of £1,000,000.
  <br><br>
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>ADDING TO YOUR INVESTMENT</b></font>
  <br>
  You can add to your account at any time and the current rate of interest will be applied immediately. The Falcon 120 account offers tiered levels at £25,000, £50,000 and £100,000 and there is a significant rise in the rate of interest at each one.
  <br><br>
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>ACCESS TO YOUR INVESTMENT</b></font>
  <br>
  Should you wish to make a withdrawal from your Falcon 120 account you may do so in two ways which will not incur penalties. Any withdrawal which leaves the account balance over £50,000 is penalty free, as is a withdrawal from your account where 120 days written notice is offered. However, should you need access to your savings immediately, you may do so but with the loss of 120 days interest. Withdrawals can be made at any Society Branch or Agency.
  <br><br>
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>INTEREST PAYMENTS</b></font>
  <br>
  Annual Option - Interest is paid annually on the 31st December. This payment can be credited directly to the account or transferred to another suitable account with the Society.
  <br><br>
  Monthly Income Option - Should you choose the option of taking a monthly income from your investment, interest wll be paid on the last working day of every month, either by transferto a suitable Society account or direct to your bank account.
  <br><br>
  Current interest rates will be supplied to you on request and are on display at all Branch and Agency offices.
  <br><br>
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>INCOME TAX</b></font>
  <br>
  Interest will be paid after deduction of income tax at the lower rate or, subject to the required certification, gross. Registration forms are available from any of the Society's Branches or Agencies, or direct from the Inland Revenue. If you have <a class=s5 href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readermain.html" target=_blank>Adobe Acrobat Reader</a> click <a class=s5 href="http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/pdfs/r85.pdf" target=_blank>here to download the R85 form</a>. If you are a non-taxpayer you will be able to claim repayment of this tax directly from the Inland Revenue. You can also claim a repayment of tax, if your taxable income falls within the starting rate band and you are eligible to pay less tax than the amount deducted from your interest. Individuals who are liable at the higher rate of income tax will have to pay additional tax on the interest to cover the difference between the tax deducted and the higher rate tax due.
  <br><br>
  The Society is required to supply the Inland Revenue with details of all interest paid or credited to investors each year.
  <br><br>
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>FALCON 120
  <br>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ISSUE</b></font>
  <ol>
    <li>INVESTMENTS: Each account is subject to a minimum investment of £5,000 (Annual Interest Option) or £10,000 (Monthly Interest Option - see note 6 below). Additional sums of any amount may be invested at any time up to the Society's maximum of £1,000,000.
        <br><br>
    <li>COOLING OFF PERIOD: If, after careful consideration, you decide that you are not happy with your choice of savings or investment account(s) and you bring this to our attention within 14 days of your initial receipt, we will help you to either switch accounts or return your money with any interest earned over that period*. We will ignore any notice periods and additional charges in these cases.
        <br><br>*Please note: Cheques paid in within the 14 day period will have to clear before a refund can be given. 
        <br>
    <li>WITHDRAWALS: These are available with 120 days written notice where interest is paid in full, or payable on demand without notice, with the loss of 120 days interest on the amount withdrawn. For notice withdrawals, a period of 7 days' grace is allowed at the end of the notice period, after which notice will have to be resubmitted if penalty interest is to be avoided.
        <br><br>
        Immediate penalty free withdrawals are available provided that a balance of at least £50,000, or more, remains in the account after withdrawal. Immediate withdrawals which take the account balance below £50,000 will be split and charged as follows:-
        <br><br>
        <ul>
        <li>The portion of the withdrawal between the existing balance and £50,000, will be penalty free, with the remainder of the withdrawal taking the balance below £50,0000, incurring 120 day's loss of interest at the prevailing interest rate.
        </ul>
        <br>
        In practice the Society allows withdrawals up to £500 in cash or up to the account balance by cheque, to be available immediately at any Branch Office. Withdrawals are also available at the Society's Agencies - up to £300 in cash and up to the account balance by cheque, but prior notice may be required.
        <br><br>
        If the balance on a Falcon 120 Annual Income account drops below £5,000, the account will be closed and the balance transferred to a Falcon Instant Access account, with the loss of 120 days interest on the closing balance.
        <br><br>
    <li>INTEREST: This is calculated on a daily basis, including the day of receipt but excluding the day of withdrawal, and paid on the 31st December each year (Except for monthly income accounts - see note 6 below).
        <br><br>
        Annual Option: Interest may be credited to the account or transferred to another suitable account with the Society.
        <br><br>
        Monthly Option: Interest may be transferred to another suitable account with the Society, paid direct to your bank account or credited to the account.
        <br><br>
        Additional interest becomes payable when an account balance reaches £25,000, £50,000 and £100,000 respectively. Conversely, when an account balance falls below these levels, the interest rate payable will be reduced accordingly.
        <br><br>
        Penalty interest is debited to the account, calculated on the amount withdrawn at the prevailing interest rates applicable to the tiered levels. The Society reserves the right to deduct any outstanding penalty/debit interest from the capital balance at the next interest date or at the date of closure. Penalty/debit interest arises when the amount of penalty/debit charged exceeds the amount of credit interest earned.
        <br><br>
    <li>INTEREST RATES: We reserve the rightt to amend interest rates at our discretion using one or more of the following methods:
    <ol>
      <li>Advertisements in the Yorkshire Post and Derbyshire Times Newspapers
      <li>Notice in Branch and Agency offices
      <li>Individual notification to investors
      <li>Internet - Society Website
    </ol>
        <br>
    <li>MONTHLY INCOME OPTION: This is available on accounts with £10,000 balances and interest will be paid on the last working day of each month, either to a suitable account with the Society or direct to a bank account. Accounts will receive the first interest payment on the last working day of the same month, unless they are opened within the last 5 working days of a month, in which case the initial interest payment will cover the period from the date the account was opened to the end of the following month. Thereafter, the amount of each monthly payment will be based on the number of days in the month.
        <br><br>
        If the balance of a Falcon 120 Monthly Income account falls below £10,000, monthly payments will be stopped and the balance transferred, without penalty, to a Falcon 120 account paying annual interest. However if requested by the investor, the account may be transferred to another suitable account, but with the loss of 120 days' interest on the closing balance.
        <br><br>
    <li>AMENDMENTS: We reserve the right to amend Terms and Conditions of Issue at our discretion. Should the change be to your disadvantage, we will tell you about it personally at least 30 days before we make the change.
