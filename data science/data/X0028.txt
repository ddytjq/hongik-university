<h3>Coaching Youth Basketball</h3>
<p>by Ed Riley</p>
<p>
<h3>CHAPTER 21 Here's a butt, there's a butt, everywhere a butt,
butt</h3>

<p>Now we come to the brutal side of the sport. Basketball is not a you
touch me = you fouled me! Watch a college game and you'll see what I mean.
Watch the forwards and centers close to the basket battling for position. Every
time the ball goes down the court you'll see bodies jockeying for
position. </p>

<p>Basketball can be a hard physical, contact sport. My team of
8th grade girls has been playing for 5 years. In those 5 years, my players
have had 1 broken arm, 8 broken fingers, a concussion, a broken wrist, and
about 4-6 bruises and cuts per girl, per game. But these are girls you say,
they are supposed to be sugar and spice and all things nice. Yeah right!!!!
There's more physical contact and more trash talking amongst the girls than
between the boys. </p>

<p>Ok, you caught me, I strayed and went on a
tangent. So what does hard physical play have to do with butts? And the
answer is REBOUNDING!! Alright, so you know peanut butter and jelly go
together, but butts and rebounding?? </p>

<p>I could be wrong, but I believe it
was UCLA's John Wooden who taught his players that once someone
shoots:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't watch the ball in the beginning, LOOK TO SEE WHERE YOU
SHOULD BE POSITIONED AROUND THE BASKET AND GET TO THAT POSITION.</li>
<li>Then move anyone out,  who is in the way</li>
<li>Then rebound</li></ol>

<p>Now I believe I am right that this is Coach Wooden's general philosphy. If I am
wrong, I sincerely apologize.  I still believe the principles are
correct. So how do you move someone out of a desired position? If you use
your hands or arms or shoulders to move them, then you have just fouled
them, and fouls against you are not good things. But if you place your butt
against them and slowly but strongly push them out of the way, you normally
won't receive a foul. What you can't do is wind up and quickly hit them with
your butt and  send them flying. This is a foul for sure.</p>

<p>So here's a little drill for your next LS. </p>

<p><b>THE BUTT DRILL</b></p>
<p>There is a circle in the center of your basketball court and it's drawn on the floor. Place a
ball in the middle of the circle on the floor. Place player A  just inside
the circle, facing the ball. Place player B behind player A, again facing
the ball.  A must be able to feel B behind them at the start of this drill.
When you blow the whistle player A's job is to keep player B from getting
the ball for at least 5 seconds. And player A is not allowed to turn around
to see where player B is. B must try to get around A to get the ball. When
you first teach them this drill, the kids may feel awkward about butting up
to someone. After they learn how to do it, this will become one of their
favorites.</p>

<p>This drill teaches them how to keep someone from getting
position for a rebound. To get a rebound you have to finally look to see
where the ball is going in order to catch it. That's why you don't let them
look to see where their opposing player is in the butt drill. They have to
do it by feel.</p>

<p>Once they get good at the butt drill, then you move on to
actual rebounding. Have 6 kids in a semi-circle around the basket. You shoot
and they must fight for position to get the rebound. It will get aggressive
and you may have to calm them down at times. Having to calm them down is a
good thing. You want aggressive players, but not overly aggressive.
Remember, fouls are not a good thing!</p>

<p>Rebounding is the hardest thing
on the court because rebounding is nothing more than technique and desire.
Even if you are positioned, you stiil have to have the desire to fight for
that ball. Other players are going to try to move you out, steal it from
you, and jump on your back to get that rebound. You have to want it more
than they do, it's just that simple. I WOULD GIVE OUT MORE REWARDS AND
POSITIVE PRAISE FOR REBOUNDING, THAN FOR ANYTHING ELSE YOU DO!!</p>

<p>Here's a quote from a friend of mine, Coach MPH,  that he posted on
Chalk Talk, my favorite website. "Defense wins games, AND REBOUNDING WINS
CHAMPIONSHIPS !" Guess that tells you how important he thinks rebounding
is.</p>

<p>Sbay Coach, another friend of mine, posted this quote for me from a
book by the late Ricky Birdsong, "THERE IS NO GLORY IN REBOUNDING, JUST
VICTORIES!!"</p>

<p>Are you starting to see the big picture? Your kids have been
trained to think that the 3-point shot is the cool thing. They've been
taught that ESPN will show hi-lights of a great dunk. When was the last time
tv showed someone get great positioning and fight for an outstanding
rebound? How about never!!! You have to praise these kids and reward them
with tootsie rolls, ice cream, whatever it takes, if you want to get your
share of rebounds.</p>

<p>Here's another way to get them to rebound, tell them
that a rebound is nothing more than a pass to them. Their job is to get that
pass. Do whatever it takes, but make rebounding the exciting thing. In your
next scrimmage, don't count points from only baskets. Here's a new way to
count, 2 points for a basket and one point to the team that gets the
rebound.  Make rebounding fun and 20 years from now your kids will say that
you were a great teacher of the game.</p>

<p>And remember to come back to this website because chapter 22 is due very soon.</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF">Chapter 22 - Did you pack your socks, your toothbrush, your
...........</font></h3>

<p>Let me explain something about my lack of organization, then
you will understand this chapter. I started out thinking I would do an
internet posting on Chalk Talk. It was titled, The Never Ending Story. This
was meant to be a continual listing of ideas for new coaches by a variety of
experienced coaches. For some reason, it didn't take off, it flat out
flopped.</p><p>I had a bunch of different ideas I had already written down, so
I started to put it together as an article. Problem was, it  never seemed to
end. (I guess I like the sound of my own keyboard.) Finally, I decided to
put it together as Coaching Youth Basketball blah-blah-blah.</p><p>So where am
I going with this? The way I started this has definitely controlled the way
it's organized, or disorganized. So last night I'm reviewing what's posted
so far. It's kind of like going on vacation. My wife, Jennifer, always asks
the same questions: Did you pack your socks, toothbrush, dental floss, Billy
Bob Teeth, 10 cartoons of cigarettes, etc. She knows me real well because I
always forget something. The same is true with me posting this for you
folks. I have totally left out a few minor details that I need to correct.
I'm being sarcastic when I call them minor.</p><p>As you can tell, this is
taking a while to get this all posted when I do it one chapter at a time.
Some of you may have already started your league play, and are a little
lost. So here's where I pray you haven't had your first game yet, because if
you have, I let you down, and for that I am sorry. Let's make up for it
here.</p>

<h3>Preparations Before Your First Game</h3>
<ol>
<li>In every one of your
LS's you have given your kids water breaks. They're not camels, so they need
them, right? Now the same is true during a real game, they need water.
During every time out, 1/2 time, and even when they are just sitting on the
bench, your players are going to lose their focus on the game and focus in
on Fort Knox, the water fountain!!! They would give up chocolate dipped
cones for a month for just one good slug off of that
fountain.<br><br>There's a major downside to this, water first, everything
else second. They could care less about the game unless they get those
precious body fluids. This is not a good thing, it's a bad thing. So how do
you solve this? Team Rule # 5 = Everyone brings a water jug to the game.
This will solve your problem. By the way, for those of you who are anal
retentive, you are correct - you haven't been given Riley's Rules
yet.</li>

<li>Uniforms - Normally your school will refer you to a company
they use. Some leagues distribute their own. If none of this applies to you,
go to your yellow pages and look under sporting goods stores. You'll find
some this way.</li>

<li>$$$$$ - Make sure you don't pay for everything. Let
your players and PARENTS know that they are responsible for any expenses
incurred. Tell them there will be league fees, uniform costs, tournaments ,
and other misc. expenses. As you find out what the costs will be, collect
your money from them up front. <br><br>I have always thought I was a pretty
shrewd businessman. When I was 17 I had over $50,000 in the bank, and I had
earned every penny. I knew all about money, until I started coaching. In the
summer of "99" I started an AAU basketball club. I had 238 kids play ball
for me. It cost me over $11,000 out of my pocket, that's how savvy I
was.<br><br>Trust this ole dawg, collect the $$$$ up front.</li>

<li>GENERATE ENTHUSIASM - Enthusiasm is a good thing. During every competitive team drill
in your LS's *** MAKE THE KIDS YELL, SCREAM, AND CHEER FOR THEIR TEAMMATES
*** If a team doesn't cheer enough, they do 2 laps. This will teach them to
cheer and be enthusiastic. It will carry over into your games, especially
when you tell them to do it as loud as they can in a game.</li>

<li>PICKING THE RIGHT PLAYERS FOR THE RIGHT POSITIONS - This is where I may deviate from
most youth coaches. Don't stereotype your kids! Here's what most people do,
the short kids are guards and the tall kids are forwards.
WWWWRRRROOOONNNNGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!! <br><br>You should have a good feel for
what your kids strengths and weaknesses are. Take your best ball handlers
and they are your guards. Your worst dribblers should be your forwards. The
last thing you need to worry about is height. You have to get the ball down
the court and if your tallest player is your best ball handler, they are a
guard.</li></ol>

<h3>RILEY'S RULES</h3>

<ol>
<li>Every player must be there at least 20
minutes before game time. If they don't, then they sit on the bench for the
first half. I don't care what useless excuses the parents come up with, the
rules apply to everyone unless they call you in advance. You don't want to
be worried about where your team is 5 minutes before game time, that's not a
fun thing.</li>

<li>Make sure you have a good enough ball that can be used
for a game ball, most leagues require this.</li>

<li>Make sure you bring 
a bag of balls that your team can use during warm ups. It's kind of
embarrassing when you have to borrow a ball from another team. The end
result is that you have 8-12 players trying to warm up with one ball, and
that's not cool.</li>

<li>Make sure you are dressed semi-cool, no geek look.
Leave the leisure suits at home. It's very important to your kids that they
not be embarrassed by their coach's appearance. Don't ask me, it's one of
those un-written laws of kid land.</li>

<li>This is the water jug rule.</li>

<li>Everyone gets equal playing time. You are just flat out stupid
if you don't follow this rule in the beginning. Some kids don't shine until
it's show time. This means they suck in practice, but are one of your best in
a game. The reverse can be true as well.  Even if you plan on breaking this
rule because you go to the dark side and worry about winning your 3rd grade
league, it's too early to be able to tell who will end up being your best.
Given time, you will be able to tell, but not at this stage in the season.
<br><br>Another angle is that today's best, may not be tomorrow's. Don't lose
your future Michaels because of today's yearning for a win. Play your kids
equally, at least for a while.</li>

<li>SUBSTITUTIONS - If you don't
control this, you will dream about these words, "When do I get to play?"
"When do I get to go in?" "Is it time yet?" You pant leg will be tugged to
death. Your shirt will be half ripped off because of tiny little hands
tugging at you. You will promise yourself, never again!<br><br>Here's how to
control it, K.I.S.S. = KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID!! You will find that your
games will consist of 3-6 minute quarters, or 6-12 minute halves. At the
older ages, the length of a game is longer. Tell your kids that you are
going to substitute every 3 minutes and that they all get to play equally.
During the game, show them where the clock on the wall is, and tell them to
stand up when 3 minutes are up. This way you can watch the game, yet when
they stand up you know it's time to sub. Your players just became your sub
clock. SIMPLE IS GOOD !!<br><br>I was so frustrated when I started coaching
because of all the nagging about PT, or playing time,  that I finally talked
my wife into video taping the games just so I could watch the game at home.
And with this in mind, let me give you a Kodak moment. Tape your first game,
years later you'll enjoy it more than anything else you own.</li>

<li>At the beginning of the game tell them that you know they are going to make
mistakes, and that's ok. The most important thing is to play as hard as they
can, AND TO HAVE AS MUCH FUN AS THEY CAN. THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS TOO MUCH
FUN!!</li>

<li>Yell nothing but encouraging things to your kids, no
negatives. Directions are ok to yell out, but watch the tone in your voice .
Remember, they signed up to play a game, and games are supposed to have
fun.</li>

<li>At the end of the game, win or lose, line your players up to
congratulate the other team on a great game. Then have a quick team meeting.
Tell them how proud you are of each and every one of them, and mean it.
These kids just played their hearts out for you, appreciate it. If you can't
mean it, find someone else to coach the team, because you need to quit.
These aren't NBA players, they are kids. Remember, COACH = TEACHER AND ROLE
MODEL. This is your turn to be the role model, a fun one.</li></ol>

<p>I AM SORRY THAT THIS IS SO DISJOINTED, BUT I NEEDED TO GET YOU THIS MISCELLANEOUS INFO,
HOPEFULLY BEFORE YOU PLAYED YOUR FIRST GAME.  If you like this book, please
visit this website again because there are more chapters to come.</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF">Chapter 23 - No Weak Sisters Allowed!</font></h3>

<p>Posting this a chapter at a 
time is a blessing in disguise at times. I got an e-mail from a woman who is 
taking over her daughter's 5th grade team. She's been reading this book on 
the web and e-mails me. Her e-mail reminds me of just how stupid I am for 
overlooking some real basic things that are essential for beginning coaches 
. Because I am posting this a chapter at a time, I can correct this 
stupidity just by adding a chapter here or there. The cool thing is that 
you, the reader, will never know this chapter wasn't in the original grand 
design. So I won't tell anyone if you don't!!!</p>

<p>Anyhow, Julie is taking 
over her daughter's team and has decided that teaching them is going to be 
her #1 priority. She is going to write them an introductory letter giving 
the players and parents some info on LS times and stuff. She e-mails asking 
me if she should announce her intentions to teach the kids rather than worry 
about winning? From the way this was written, I think that she had a hard 
time deciding whether to leave in the part in about winning.</p>

<p>On the 
surface this is such a logical question that I'm sure a lot of you beginning 
coaches would have asked it yourselves. So why am I stupid? I blame it all 
on my - - all kidding aside, I need to clarify a major point here. Yes, I 
have been preaching teaching over winning at the youth level, but this is 
where we've got to play "I've Got a Secret!" NEVER EVER TELL ANYONE YOU 
DON'T CARE ABOUT WINNING.  Everyone loves a winner. The whole world loves a 
winner. No one wants to be on a losing team. </p>

<p>If you are a woman 
coaching  a team, you have just entered a predominately male arena. The last 
thing you need to appear is WEAK. No bleeding heart liberals are allowed on 
the court, is the motto of most coaches. Remember that lovable but untrue 
statement, "No pain, no gain?" A guy thought that up.  Most male coaches, 
not all but most, should have been born before women got the vote. At least 
they act this way. They will say nice things to you, and gut you when you 
turn your back to them. If your team beats their team, you just became a 
candidate for bitch of the year. This is the arena you have entered. My job 
is to help you avoid excess grief and make your life simpler.</p>

<p>Now if you 
are a guy who espouses the "Let's not worry about winning" attitude, your 
sexual preferences will be questioned, to say the least. </p><p>Whether you are 
male or female, you can't tell anyone you don't care about winning. Your 
players won't try as hard, and their parents won't support you. Even your 
own child will cop an attitude on you. So here's an example of AN 
INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT  YOU CAN MAKE.</p>

<p>This year we are going to be 
changing our priorities a bit. My job as your coach is going to be to TEACH 
MY PLAYERS ENOUGH TO WIN. My #2 priority is to teach them the morals and 
values that sports and good sportsmanlike conduct provide, morals and values 
they will be able to use for the rest of their lives.  </p>

<p>My players 
priorities are to learn enough to win, and still have as much fun as they 
can, IN A STRUCTURED SETTING..</p>

<p>The parents job is to support their 
CHILD,  the team, and the coach in all of their endeavors. In order 
to accomplish this, we need to change the way we think and changing our 
vocabulary will help accomplish this. We will not have practices, we will 
have Learning Sessions. I prefer not to be called Mr. Riley, or even Coach, 
I would prefer it if the kids called me Teach, a nickname for teacher.etc. 
etc. etc.</p>

<p>Do you get the big picture? You have just proclaimed to the 
world that your mission in life is to teach these kids how to play 
basketball. A derivative from the Field of Dreams is "If you teach them, 
they will win!" So there is absolutely no reason to announce that your 
priority is to teach, rather than to win.</p>

<p>As a coach you must be 
confident, but not cocky. You must be strong, but understanding. Fun loving, 
yet focused. The one thing you need to know is that over the doorway of 
every gym is an invisible sign. This universal, yet invisible sign reads, 
"NO WEAK SISTERS ALLOWED!!" You can be a teacher and still honor the sign, 
this I promise you.</p>

<p>Julie, I want to publicly thank you for opening my 
eyes to some things I would normally have overlooked. Thank-you!!</p>

<h3>C<font color="#0000FF">hapter 24 - RUN, FORREST, RUN!</font></h3>

<p>I've gone into philosophy, technique, 
drills, defenses, offenses, and lots more. Now let's talk about the nature 
of the game. The nature of basketball is running.  If I catch one of my kids 
walking on a basketball court, it's extra laps or suicides. 
</p>

<p>Basketball is a running game. There is never a moment that the clock is 
running that you shouldn't be running. Defense is running. Offense is 
running. The only time you don't run is during a free throw,  or when the 
ball is out of bounds, or during a halftime or timeout. Guess what?  The 
clock is stopped during all of these exceptions. So when the clock is 
running, your players should be running.</p>

<p>So how do you incorporate 
getting into shape with your LS? Here is an example of what I personally 
will never do. I hated my basketball practices in jr. high and high school 
when I was a kid. Every practice, and it was never a learning session, 
started with 10 laps. Then we had to run up and down the stairs for another 
10 minutes. Every practice started out negatively, I WAS HATIN' LIFE! Of 
course, my coach never got the best out of me because I started every 
practice using language that would put George Carlin to shame.</p>

<p>Now let's 
see how you are conducting your LS's. I have you doing 2 ball suicide 
competitive drills, that's running. You have your players doing lots of 
other competitive drills with laps for the losers, that's running. You are 
getting your team into shape by the use of competitive drills. Competitive 
drills are fun, teach a skill, and promote aggressive competitiveness.  Do 
your kids hate you? NO! Are you a slave driver having them do mindless lap 
after lap? NO! You are making them run, and normally they ask for more. Is 
this simple, or what? AND SIMPLE IS GOOD. (I had to throw that in because I 
hadn't said it in a while.)</p>

<p>The real question is are you getting them 
in good enough shape? For your first several games, the answer is yes. If 
you sub every 3 to 4 minutes, if you let everyone get equal playing time, 
then the answer is yes. But as the season progresses, your kids will need to 
be in even better shape. As the kids in your league gain more experience and 
get a little better, the games will become faster and faster. 
</p>

<p>There's a term that a friend of mine, Rob Ellis, uses that I have 
adopted. He doesn't talk about getting his kids into shape, he tells his 
kids that they need to get their "BASKETBALL LEGS!" No one wants to hear 
they are fat, lazy, and out of shape. If you use the term "Basketball Legs" 
with your kids, they will look at you and ask what that means. Here's what I 
tell them, "It takes special legs to become a good basketball player, it 
takes Basketball Legs. We just need to play a little harder in our LS's and 
do a few more of our faster drills, and you'll get those special legs." From 
then on, compliment someone on using their Basketball Legs when someone is 
busting their tush running. Running will become contagious.</p>

<p>The main 
way to go to the next level is so simple, it's ridiculous. With each LS give 
out fewer and fewer tootsie roll pops, and make the losers do laps or 
suicides instead. The way to do this without creating a lot of attitude, is 
let your kids choose what the losers of a competitive drill have to do, 2 
laps or a suicide. They get to choose, and you get off the hook. You are not 
the evil ogre who makes them run laps, they are!</p>

<p>Here's another way 
to get them in better shape and learn how to improve their dribbling at the 
same time, invite them to your 1st dribbling contest. Make this a big deal 
where the 3 winners get Baskin-Robbins. Pick a time when you don't have the 
gym, you don't want to eat up your LS gymtime with this. Tell them what day 
and time to meet you at your high school football stadium. </p>

<p>Once they are at the stadium, have them stretch and warm up. Next have them do a practice 
run, they have to dribble a ball up the steps of the football stadium. Make 
sure you have someone video tape this because you'll win a prize with this 
tape, maybe a Nobel. </p>

<p>You are going to see a gajillion balls flying down 
those steps and a loose kid running after every ball. If this doesn't get 
them their Basketball Legs, nothing will. All they will be doing is running 
up and down the steps the whole time. They are having a blast, and you are a 
hero. </p>

<p>After a while they will learn that if they can keep their dribble 
close to the ground and control their ball, they can make it to the top of 
the stadium without having to run back down, chasing their ball. The first 
3  to make it to the top, dribbling the whole way without stopping, wins. If 
no one wins, tell them that you will do this another day so they get another 
chance for the ice cream. Or give them one last chance and the 3 who make it 
the furthest before losing their ball win.</p>

<p>The next time you do this 
LS at the football stadium, they will get better and thus, run less. When 
this occurs, have them dribble the ball down the steps. Even more balls will 
fly down the steps than before. When do you quit doing this? Never! My 8th 
grade girls team now does it dribble 2 balls at a time.</p>

<p>Remember, basketball is nothing but a running sport. The older your kids get, the more 
they have to run. The following is a saying I got out of a Nike Basketball 
Camp manual, author unknown.</p>

<p>"Every morning in Africa a gazelle wakes up</p>
<p>It knows it must run faster than the fastest lion, or it will be eaten.</p>
<p>Every morning a lion wakes up,</p>
<p>and it knows it must outrun the fastest gazelle, or it will starve to death.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you are a gazelle or a lion:</p>
<p>WHEN THE SUN COMES UP</p>
<p>YOU HAD BETTER BE RUNNING !!!!! "</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF">Chapter 25 - Follow the Bouncing Ball</font></h3>
<p>For those of you who are old 
enough, remember the old cartoons that would give you the words to some ole 
folks song, and tell you to "Follow the bouncing ball?"  Was that the 
beginning of karioke? (I hope I spelled that right.)</p><p>Anyway, this is 
all about playing your position and not playing herd ball. What is herd 
ball? If you have to ask this question, it's obvious you have never been to 
a first grade soccer game. With 1st graders, no one plays their position, 
everyone runs after the ball. What you have is a bunch of the cutest tykes 
in the world running around with shorts on that almost come down to their 
ankles. Wherever the ball is, there you will find about 10 little uns 
kicking the wee-wads out of each other trying to get to the ball. It 
sometimes takes 2 minutes to get the ball to move as little as 10 feet 
because of the herd of kids.</p><p>So how does this apply to basketball? In 
the beginning your players may try to follow the follow the ball, rather 
than play their position. This is not a good thing. Here are some examples 
of following the ball on defense and offense.</p><p><b>DEFENSE</b></p><p> Let's 
say that you are playing a m-2-m defense. you will find that there are at 
least 1 or more of your players who won't guard their man because they are 
too busy following the player with the ball. This always leaves someone 
unguarded on the other team. Someone will inevitably pass the ball to the 
open player. The funny thing is that this player may not have scored a point 
all year long, but I promise you they will score against you this time, 
Murphy's Law.</p><p>Let's say you are playing a zone defense. You will have 
players leave their area and begin to follow the ball. Again, this leaves a 
wide open area unguarded. This  is a bbbaaadddd thing!!!!</p><p>Here's the 
hard part, let's say your player follows the ball, leaving their man or area 
unguarded. Let's also assume that they actually steal the ball from the 
other team, takes it the length of the court and makes a lay-up. Everyone is 
up and cheering. Your initial response is to tell that player "Great job!" 
WRONG!!! By doing this you are telling them it's ok not to play their 
position. This will cost you more points then you will ever gain.</p><p>I had a 
player like this in 4th grade. She was my best natural athlete on the team. 
She could home in on the ball and steal it at least 1/2 the time. This 
worked in 4th and 5th grade. In 6th grade the other teams were now smart 
enough that they just passed the ball to her unguarded player and score at 
will. It took a while for what was happening to sink in, but once she 
realized what was happening, she dedicated herself to playing proper defense 
and became a great defensive player.</p><p>The hard part about this is that 
these players can have some success stealing the ball at the younger ages. 
This reinforces the idea that this is a cool thing to do. The sad part is, 
my player who made the transition from following the ball to playing great 
defense, is the exception. Most players can't change their habit of 
following that stupid bouncing ball, and so by 9th grade they aren't good 
enough to make a team.</p><p><b>OFFENSE</b></p><p>Now let's see how following the 
ball affects you on offense. The key to any offense is to be able to get a 
player open to take a good shot. This doesn't happen in herd ball. In your 
first year of coaching you will have some kids who stay within 5 feet of 
your player who has the ball.  No one gets open this way, no one. Here are 
some examples of what happens this way.</p><p>When my daughter, Crash, was in 
5th grade she was 5'4" and 125 pounds. She was one big, strong kid. I had 
taught my team to only make bounce passes. Well, when she had the ball, 
there would always be  2 of our players playing herd ball. They would be so 
close to her that when she bounce passed the ball to them, it would bounce 
off of their feet, shins, or knees. I have always preached never to make a 
weak pass, so she would pass it so hard that she would knock her teammates 
over. If they they weren't knocked over, they would still fall down rubbing
their shin or knee, where Crash had creamed them.</p><p>Let me explain how 
powerful an urge it is to follow the ball. Crash is slightly anal retentive, 
so she never quit making strong  hard passes. Here comes that powerful urge 
to follow the ball. Even after Crash had creamed a teammate 3 times in the 
same game, even after I had told this kid to quit following the ball, Crash 
still got the opportunity to cream the kid a 4th and 5th time. "No pain, No 
gain" sure didn't apply here, now did it? These same kids would walk off the 
court after every game with bruised shins and knees, they just couldn't 
resist the urge to follow the ball.</p><p>Another example of how following the 
ball is a bad thing is what it allows the other team to do. If you have 3 
offensive players in a 5 foot circle, then it only takes one of their 
defensive players to cover 3 of your offensive players effectively. Your 
other 2 players won't be able to get open because now the other team has 4 
defensive players covering your 2 players who aren't playing herd ball. So 
the net result is your offense is at a standstill. </p><p>Something I have 
forgotten to tell you is the 5 second rule. If your player has the ball and 
stands in one spot without dribbling for 5 seconds, and the other team has a 
defensive player within 3 feet of your player, then you will hear the ref's 
whistle. If they don't move within 5 seconds, the other team gets the ball. 
When you play herd ball, you will hear this whistle a lot. Whistles are not 
good things.</p><p><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></p><p>Yes, there are other chapters 
coming, but  you might learn something from these acknowledgements. ...  I 
would like to take a few moments  to thank a few folks who are making this 
possible. I will start with Norm at Chalk Talk. Chalk Talk is quite possibly 
the best basketball discussion board on the net. I started posting my book 
on Chalk Talk and Norm owns Chalk Talk. Thanks for all of your space and 
help. If you have questions that you want a lot of different viewpoints on 
from experienced coaches, then go to Chalk Talk at <A 
href="http://www.worldofsports.com">www.worldofsports.com</A> and then look for 
the current month of Chalk Talk, it's well worth your time. Norm, thank-you 
for everything, especially for putting up with a crusty ole fart like 
me.</p><p>Next I would like to thank Steve Jordan, aka Alaska Coach. He allowed 
me to continue posting this book on his site. Alaska has also been one of my 
main inspirations, without him I don't know if this book would have ever 
happened. His website has everything from AA-ZZZ. His site is one of 2 that 
I call my Basketball Encarta. To get there go to <A 
href="http://www.alaskalife.net/sjordan">www.alaskalife.net/sjordan</A>  Let 
100% of the site come up, then go to coach's notebook. You will be like a 
kid at Disneyworld.</p><p>I can't forget about Coach Larry Dean Jackson. LD 
let me post on his site, again, without which this book would never have 
happened. If you ever want to find offensive or defensive plays, this guy 
has more plays on his site than Jimmy Carter had peanuts. This site is the 
other part of my Basketball Encarta.</p><p>Norm, Alaska, and LD, I thank 
you from the bottom of my heart. If we can keep one future youth coach from 
becoming a tyrannical, screaming egotistical idiot who ruins the game for 
the kids, then we have achieved a lot. If thanks aren't enough, then I guess 
I will have to buy you a brewski if you ever come to St. Louis.</p><p>Next 
to last, but not least, there are the regulars on Chalk Talk who have 
influenced me and my coaching style, or lack of. Coaches Bonifield, Country 
Coach, Coach Sbay, Coach Mackinney, Phil G., Coach Keith, (even if you are 
tired of the book,) Coach K,( even when you diss me, we both still learn,) 
and all of the others I haven't named, thank you for helping to bring out 
the parts of me that I like.</p><p>And finally I would like to thank my 
wife, Jennifer, for all of her patience. I know my sitting at a stupid 
keyboard frustrates you, so thank you. You are still my best friend in the 
whole world. And the adventure continues...</p><p>And Crash, for teaching me 
how to be a father and a coach. Here is a lesson for all of you coaches who 
have kids that play for you. In 4th grade I never screamed at my kids, 
except Crash. Every time she screwed up, which was a lot, I jumped all over 
her with both feet. Finally, she sat me down and explained that I needed to 
treat her like every other kid on the team. I shouldn't put any more 
pressure on her than I did anyone else on the team, because that wasn't fair 
to her. She was right! The moment I quit riding her, she became a better 
player. More importantly, I became a better coach and a better 
father.</p><p>If you can find that you can use even one idea from this book, 
then e-mail Alaska, Ld, and Norm. Let them know that they have done 
something good. I have not made one penny from this, and neither have they. 
Every once in a while people need a pat on the back. In fact, if you see any 
of these guys on the street, give them a hug. (God, I've watched too many 
movies. The hug part came from Holy Man with Eddie Murphy.)</p><p>Stay 
tuned to this website, more chapters to come.......</p>

<H3><font color="#0000FF">Chapter 26 - "Stack em up - Move em out!"</font></H3>
<P>OK folks, it's game time or your first game is rapidly approaching, so I 
guess it's time philosophize a little less and give you some meat and potatoes. 
We're going to talk about in-bounding the ball. That's where your team gets the 
ball and has to throw it inbounds. I'm going to start where you get the ball out 
of bounds under your own basket.
<P>Before I give you the plays, we need to revisit SIMPLE IS GOOD! I am not 
concerned with giving you inbounds plays that give you quick baskets. I am more 
concerned with your being able to just get the ball inbounds. Here's a rule you 
need to know. Once the referee, ref, gives the ball to your player to throw it 
in, you have 5 seconds to throw it in or the other team gets the ball. With that 
said, here's a couple of plays that are so stupid, they work.
<P>THE HUDDLE
<P>This is the most fun inbounds play I know of for younger kids. As they get 
older, they will feel retarded doing it. As this is for the younger kids, don't 
worry about looking cool.
<ol>
<li>The ref will hand the ball to your player either slightly to the right of 
your basket, or slightly to the left. What ever side the ref picks is the side 
you have your kids do the huddle on.</li>
<li>Get a piece of paper and draw half of a basketball court, including the 
paint. Now put a circle out of bounds to the right or left of the basket. This 
represents your player who is going to throw the ball inbounds.</li>
<li>An inch or 2 from your "O" put 4 X's in a tight diamond shape, directly in 
front of your O. This represents your other 4 players who are about 8' inbounds 
directly in front your O, or your player throwing the ball in.
<P>...................O<BR>................x<BR>.............x...x<BR>...............x</li>

<li>Once they are in this formation, have them form a huddle, just like a 
football team does. Have everyone wrap their arms around the shoulders of the 
players who are next to them. This is a huddle.</li>

<li>Let's assume that everyone is to the right of your basket. Once "O" gets 
the ball, they yell "Break." Make the player in the huddle who is furthest to 
the right of the basket, your shortest player. They sneak through the middle of 
the huddle, go under their teammates arms, and run to the basket looking for a 
pass.</li>

<li>Once the shortest player is through, everyone else turns, faces the player in-bounding
  the ball, and moves backward, looking for a pass. It looks like a 
flower that opens all of it's petals at once.</li>
</ol>
<P>Now the more experienced coaches out there are reading this and laughing 
their collective butts off. That's ok! Once you have this perfected, it works 
like a charm. In the beginning, you will find that your player who sneaks out of 
the huddle will get some easy lay-ups. Once the other team catches on to this, 
you will find that your other players are now open. You see, the other team 
concentrates so much on your sneak attack, they forget about your other 3 
players.
<P>Does this look totally retarded to the older players? You bet it does! The 
reality is that the younger players think it's cool, AND THAT'S WHO THIS IS 
DESIGNED FOR. The major benefit to the huddle is that it works. My girls used it 
for 4 years, from 4th grade - 7th grade, and only failed to get the ball 
inbounds less that a half dozen times. Approach it with a fun attitude and watch 
it work.
<P>THE DIAMOND
<P>This inbounds play starts off the same way as the huddle, except your players 
face your inbounder this time, and they don't put their arms around each other.
<ol>
<li>Your players form a diamond about 3 feet apart from one another.</li>
<li>The player closest to your inbounder goes directly to the sideline, 
parallel to the baseline, away from the basket.</li>
<li>The player on the side of your diamond away from the basket, runs backward 
about 15 feet away from your inbounder, toward the other basket. This player 
should be your last resort, or your safety valve. They only get passed to if no 
one else gets open. Also, they are your only player to stop a fast break, should 
the other team steal the ball.</li>
<li>The player furthest away from your inbounder should break to the basket, 
looking for a pass.</li>
<li>Your last player is on the side of your diamond, closest to the basket. 
They don't move at all. A lot of times, because they don't move, the other team 
forgets about them. This leaves them open for a pass from the inbounder, and a 6 
foot shot to the basket.</li>
</ol>
<P>The diamond works and it's not too complicated. I could give you The Stack, 
The Box, and any number of inbounds plays with blase descriptive names, but 
instead you have the Huddle and the Diamond. Most teams will learn the Stack and 
Box, so the other teams already know what they are going to do before they do 
it. I guarantee you, most people have never heard of your inbounds plays. The 
cool thing is that they are simple to learn, and SIMPLE IS GOOD.
<P>THE STACK
<P>I guess you better know this, so here it is. Have all 4 of your players line 
up about 8' in front of your inbounder, and about a only a foot or so of space 
between the 4 of them. They look like soldiers marching in a straight line. Once 
the inbounder gets the ball, every other player runs to the right, the others 
run to the left.
<P>Another variation is the first in line go right, the next 2 left, and the 
last one right. You can vary this anyway you want to, but the principle is to 
move to get open. This is the most commonly used inbounds play in the history of 
youth basketball. I never use it because everyone else knows what you are going 
to do, but that's just me.
<P>____________O__________________________
<P>................................X<BR>...................X<BR>...................X<BR>...................X
<P>THE BOX
<P>This is where you have your 4 players that form a box in front of your 
inbounder. They stand about 10-12 feet apart. When they hear "Break," the 
players on the right run over and screen for the players on the left. The 
players on the left then move to get open. You can do this where right screens 
left, or left screens right, or front players screen for the rear players, or 
the rear players screen for the front players.
<P>REVERSE STACK
<P>I didn't know what to call this, so reverse stack sounded good.
<P>1. Have your players line up parallel to the baseline, about 8' from the 
baseline. Have them all face the basket.
<P>______________O________________________
<BR>..........................................BASKET
<BR>...................x...x..x..x
<P>2. Now have your 2 players closest to the basket form a tight screen for your 
player furthest from the basket.
<P>_____________O___________________________
<P>...............x..x...x
<BR>................x
<P>3. The player furthest from the basket runs around the screen and is 
hopefully open for the pass. Once the screen is set, everyone moves to get open.
<P>You can vary any of these lineups and have fun with them. There is no one 
perfect way to inbound the ball. Your main goal is to inbound the ball within 5 
seconds and not let the other team steal the ball. Any play works as long as 
people are moving to get open. Again your players have to move to get open.
<P>in-bounding THE BALL UNDER THEIR BASKET
<P>I'm going to make life real simple. In your first year, let your players know 
that everyone has to help get the ball down the court whenever the other team 
plays full court defense. AND, if you have them scrimmage without dribbling in 
your LS's, at this age you won't need inbound plays. Just have them pass it down 
the court.
<P>If you find you can't get the ball inbounds at all. Then use the Huddle, 
Diamond, Stack, or any of them to get the ball in.
<P>Stay tuned to this website for I've more chapters to post. As always, if you 
have any questions you can e-mail me at firepow55@aol.com If you find this 
useful, then e-mail the site you are on now and thank them for allowing me the

<h3><font color="#0000FF">Chapter 27 - Showtime</font></h3>
<p>And now, it's showtime. The ref throws the ball up and the game has begun. 
The ball is tipped and 2 players from the other team and one of your players 
end up in a tug of war, with all three holding on to the ball for dear life. 
The whistle blows, and the ref calls jump ball. Whoever did not get the tip, 
gets the ball out of bounds. In this case, no one got control of the ball so 
they literally call for another jump ball.</p><p>This time the other teams 
gets the tip and the ball, and your kids are scrambling to find the player 
they are covering. You watch the ensuing confusion and just want to puke. 
Three of your players are guarding the same player on the other team. This 
leaves two of their players undefended and wide open for a pass.  
</p><p>You've all heard of Murphy's Law, well here's Riley's Law: YOUR WORST 
NIGHTMARE BECOMES REALITY ON A BASKETBALL  COURT. So let's see how Riley's 
Law applies here.</p><p>Two of their players are wide open because 3 of 
your players are all guarding the same player. The ball gets passed to one 
of their open guards. This player happens to be the best shot on their team, 
so naturally they pivot, shoot, and score. There's Riley's Law in 
action.</p><p>Here's another example, same scenario. The ball gets passed to a 
player who can't shoot and has never made a basket, even in practice. This 
player catches the ball, pivots, shoots, and nothing but net, they've scored 
their first basket. </p><p>The game goes on one minute and the score is 
2-0, your team is losing. Sixty seconds into the game, one of your players 
asks, "Hey coach, when can I go in?" Now you remember to tell the kids to 
stand up after 3 minutes, so you'll be reminded to substitute them into the 
game. You now tell the kids when to stand up.</p><p>After 2 minutes your 
players on the court are still having a hard time trying to figure out who 
to guard. All you want to do is scream at the top of your lungs, "How hard 
is it to remember you are guarding # 20, and you are guarding #4?"  You have 
this irresistible urge to grab them and shake some sense into 
them.</p><p>You have now encountered your first crisis as a bench coach. You 
can't thrash them or scream at them because they're littler then you. You 
have an unfair advantage, you're big and they're small. So what do you do? 
Call time out.</p><p>You are only allowed 3 or 4 timeouts per game, depending 
upon your league or tournament rules. You have just used your first. You 
call the kids over and in your best Mr. Roger's voice you say, "Why are 3 of 
you covering the same player?" No one responds. All you get are 3 blank 
faces with baby doe eyes. You begin to wonder if it's deer season 
yet.</p><p>"All right, here's what we are going to do." And you point out who 
each kid is supposed to guard, and their uniform number. You mentally pat 
yourself on the back for handling this like a big person, and the game 
resumes. You sit down in your chair, as smug as a bug in a rug.</p><p>You 
jump up suddenly, in near hysteria. Three of your players aren't guarding 
anyone. They are standing in the middle of the court, looking like a 3 year 
old who's lost their parents. The reason being, the other team substituted 
and with new players in the game, your players don't know who to 
guard.</p><p>At this point in time, you are glad you never paid for this book. 
In fact, you wish I had written something that had made you give up this 
wonderful idea you had of coaching your child's team. </p><p>Here's the 
solution, communication. Your players have to talk and whenever the other 
team substitutes, they have to start yelling, "I've got 15!" " Well then 
I've got 10," another yells. This is one of those times when you can coach. 
You should be helping out by yelling for Johnny to cover this person, or 
Suzie should be covering that person. Communication solves most of the 
problems of the world.</p><p>Play continues on the opposite side of the 
court, away from you. You think you have a pretty good long distance view, 
when the ref calls a foul on one of your players. It's just like the times 
you sit in your easy chair at home watching a game, you scream out, "No way 
ref, you need glasses." The ref looks at you and you suddenly remember where 
you are and what you are doing there. You quietly sit down on the bench. 
Every eye in the whole gym is on you, and you could hear a needle drop. 
</p><p>This last scenario is not a good one. Your players and their parents are 
now going to take your lead and start giving every ref grief over every call 
they make, good or bad. You will become known as the whiners, sore losers, 
bad winners, and not fun to be around. </p><p>In all my years of coaching, 
I have never seen a ref reverse a call, never. So as a coach you need to 
act, not react. Don't yell over a call. If you need to make a point with a 
ref, use this as an example. "Hey ref, please watch #23 on the other team. 
My players are bruised to death because of the elbows that are flying under 
the basket. " You always get more with honey than vinegar. </p>
<p>"Now coach?" you hear 5 voices ask in 
unison. "It's been 3 minutes, can we go in now?" You say yes and tell them 
to go kneel by the scorer's table. You are now making your first 
substitution. The ref waives them in and your starting 5 come to the bench. 
These 5 are just a buzz with what happened so far in the game. You ignore 
them, and watch your players who are playing. </p><p>The game goes on and your 
child is now in the game. You watch as your kid screws up on defense and the 
other team scores, Riley's Law strikes again. You jump off the bench yelling 
at your own child to get it right. The problem is the tone in your voice, 
it's nasty. </p><p>Let's stop here for a moment. It is natural for you to 
expect more out of your child. You see, you know you are perfect and so any 
child of yours has to be perfect as well. This is a well known fact, 
right???? WRONG!!!! Your kid is just that, a kid. Don't expect any more or 
less than you would out of any other kid!! Burn out is a common disease 
amongst coach's kids. </p><p>Let me tell you a little story about coach's kids. 
Last weekend I coached a team in a tourney made up of just coach's kids.  It 
started because a bunch of the coaches were talking about how their kids 
were a pain in the butt and how they wished someone else would coach their 
own kid. After a few brewski's, the idea came up of putting together a team 
of nothing but coach's daughters, and playing in tournament. Everyone 
thought it would be fun to sit on the bench and be a parent for a change. As 
you can tell, I ended up coaching the team. </p><p>I held a grand total of 
two practices, not LS's, for this team. Guess what we did for four hours? 
Scrimmaged without dribbling. Why? Because I wanted these girls to depend on 
each other. Also, coach's kids are famous for being ball hogs, and there are 
no ball hogs when you can't dribble. </p><p>Wanna know the outcome?? These 
girls had more fun than they had had in a long time. They didn't have their 
father's screaming at them from the bench. In fact, their parents didn't 
scream AT them from the bleachers either. Why?? Because my deal with the 
other coaches was that I would coach and they would be quiet in the stands. 
The moment one of them broke this agreement, they got to coach the team, and 
everyone else was then allowed to criticize them. Needless to say, everyone 
was on their best behavior. </p><p>How much fun did the girls have?? One girl, 
who was a center and never allowed to shoot a long distance shot, made a 3 
pointer. This was the first 3 pointer she had ever made in 5 years of 
playing. When she came off the court, she had a smile wrapped around both 
ears. Three of the girls secretly asked me if they could be on my team. The 
were really tired of being yelled at by their parent. Learn a lesson from 
this, TREAT YOUR OWN CHILD THE SAME AS EVERYONE ELSE ON THE TEAM. By the 
way, we lost all 3 games, and the girls still had fun. </p><p>Back to the 
game. It's now half time and you are losing by 2 points. The score is 4 to 
2.  One of your players says, "They can't dribble or pass the ball very 
good, can they?" Suddenly you realize that they're right. Your team was much 
better handling the ball. You may be losing the game, but right now you just 
don't care. Your team has been doing what you taught them. You are now a 
basketball teacher, Coach = Teacher. </p><p>You tell them to dribble with their 
heads up and starting looking for an open player to pass to. You tell them 
to make sure to talk and everyone will know who to guard that way. And you 
tell them to have fun. </p><p>The second half is a breeze. Every 3 minutes your 
bench players stand up to substitute in. Your team is out-dribbling and out-passing the other team. You don't even get too upset when one of your 
players steals the ball and goes down the wrong end of the court and shoots 
at the wrong goal. (This is going to happen because at halftime, the teams 
switch ends of the court. If they were shooting to your right the first 
half, then they shoot to your left the second half. This confuses a lot of 
kids.) None of this bothers you too much because they are dribbling with 
their heads up, making good passes, getting a lot of rebounds and doing a 
lot of things right. All this is happening because you have LS's, not 
practices. Because you don't talk in a monotone to the kids. AND BECAUSE YOU 
HAVE HELPED TO MAKE BASKETBALL A FUN GAME!!!! </p><p>Who won the game? How 
should I know, it's your game!!! </p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF">CHAPTER 28 - UUUUGGGGGHHHH !!!!!!!!!</font></h3>

<p>This is the chapter I have avoided 
writing for the longggggggggest time. I know that not all of you are in 
agreement with my Coach =Teacher and winning comes in second place. Sports 
are competitive and competition means there is a winner and a loser. When 
you lose a game and look at those sad little faces, you'll want to win the 
next one, just for the kids. I do understand all of this. I may be ignorant, 
but I'm not totally stupid. The one thing you need to know is that 1 hour 
after a loss, these kids aren't worrying about who won or lost. The only 
people who worry about a game an hour later are the coaches and parents. An 
hour after a game the kids are wondering what can they do next to keep from 
being bored.</p>

<p>So why do I dread this chapter, because I am going to give 
you a few tips on how to win a game at this age level. With one sweep of the 
pen, I am negating all of the good things I have tried to teach you. I am 
going to talk about winning. I am going to start off with good thing to 
learn, and end up with the not-so-good things.</p>

<p><b>TURNOVERS</b></p>
<p>A turnover is where your team has the ball, and you lose it to the other team. 
A turnover can come in the form of a stolen pass, a pass that you throw out 
of bounds, it can be where they steal the ball away from your dribbler, it 
can be where you have a player stand in the paint for over three seconds, 
etc., etc, etc.</p>

<p>If you can reduce the number of turnovers, you greatly increase your chance of winning. 
Here's several great ways to accomplish this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bounce pass whenever possible. It's harder to steal 
a bounce pass.</li>
<li>When receiving a pass, step toward the passer when you go to catch it.</li>
<li>Teach your kids never to dribble the ball higher than their waist. </li>
<li>Only yell "ball" when you are really open.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>free throws</b></p>

<p>It doesn't matter if it's 4th grade , or high 
school, or college, or even NBA teams who are playing, most games are won or 
lost on the free throw line. You will find that you will get 8-20 free throws a game. If you make 50% of them at the younger ages, you will rarely lose a 
game.</p>

<p>My team just played in a tournament in Illinois. I have an 8th 
grade team, and the team we were playing was a 7th grade team. This 7th 
grade team had never lost a game, not ever. At the end of the game, the 
score was 40 - 38 and we won. Here's the interesting point. The other team 
only scored 2 baskets against my girls tough m-2-m defense. But they made 34 free throws, we only made 6. They almost won, even though they only scored 2 
real baskets the whole game. And yes, at the end of the game, 5 of my 
players had fouled out.</p>

<p>The lesson to be learned is that you now need to 
incorporate shooting free throws into your LS's. </p>

<p><b>STEALER - CHASER DEFENSE </b></p>

<p>I hate to give you this one. If you are coaching a 3-5th grade 
team, think twice before you use this defense. Two of your players are going 
to work real hard, and the other 3 can become lazy. Lazy is not a good 
thing!</p>

<p>Place a forward on the block on each side of the basket. Next, 
place a forward halfway between the basket and the free throw line. These 
three forwards play a, ugh, zone. Their job is to make sure that no one gets 
a good shot off when inside their designated area. The other part of their 
job is to make sure they are in position to get every rebound. This will 
clog up your middle and in order to score, the team is going to have to 
shoot from outside. At this age, very few teams have good outside 
shooters.</p>

<p>This still leaves you two other players. Let's make one of them 
the Chaser. Take your fastest and best defensive player and place them about 
6' from the half court line. This is your Chaser. Their job is to play m-2-m 
defense against the person with the ball. </p>

<p>Let's call your remaining 
guard the Stealer. This needs to be your second best defensive player. They 
are stationed around the top of the key. As the Chaser chases the person 
with the ball, the Stealer is watching to see who the dribbler is going to 
pass to. As soon as the dribbler stops dribbling and starts to pass, the 
Stealer moves to intercept the pass. If they don't steal the pass, then they 
usually end up closer to the person who now has the ball. When this occurs, 
they yell out, "Chaser!" And the person who was the Chaser, now yells out, 
"Stealer!" What they are doing is communicating to each other their new 
positions. The Stealer becomes the Chaser, and the Chaser becomes the 
Stealer. They have to communicate or this defense will not work. </p>

<p>Some people call this a 1-1-3 defense, I just call it chaser - stealer. It's a 
great learning experience for the chaser and stealer, but your 3 forwards 
learn very little. This is why I don't like this defense for younger 
players. Once players know how to play great m-2-m defense, then this is a 
viable defense. Until then, it does nothing to help your forwards get 
better. It will win games for you, but at what price?</p>

<p><b>FAST BREAKS OR THE BLITZ</b></p>

<p>A fast break is where your team gets the ball and has to travel 
the length of the court to shoot. I love fast breaks. Many a team makes a 
living off of fast breaks, including my team. The idea is to get the ball 
down the court quickly before the other team can set up it's defense. Done 
properly, you will get a lot of lay-ups from this.</p>

<p>The problem is that 
at the younger ages, a team that can fast break on a regular basis will 
cream most of the other teams. But this is a good thing, you say. Yes, and 
no. Yes, you score a lot of points. No? The no is that you learn no other 
offensive skills. Once you come up against a team that can handle your fast break, then they own you. You learn all about
fast breaks, but the rest 
of your half court offensive game goes down the toilet.</p>

<p>Here's a simple drill for fast breaks.  Have 5 players circle the basket. You shoot from the
free throw line. Tell the kids you plan on missing because it's part of the 
drill. Why tell them this? So you don't look like an idiot when you miss a free throw. Here's the progression from there:</p>

<ol>
<li>Whoever rebounds yells "Blitz"</li>
<li>1 forward runs towards the out of bounds line on the side. 
Once there, they run down the sideline toward the opposite basket yelling, 
"Lane, lane, lane!!"</li>

<li>When this player reaches halfway between the half court line and the far free throw
  line, they run directly toward the basket. The whole time they are 
looking for a pass.</li>

<li>Another player does the exact same thing as 
this last player, but they do it on the opposite side of the court. So now 
you have the player who rebounded holding the ball, and you have a player 
running down each sideline toward the far basket.</li>

<li>This leaves you 2 free players. Both of these players run toward the half court
  line, one 
about 6' to the right of center court, one about 6' to the left. Both yell 
"outlet, outlet, outlet!"<br><br>

</div> 

<li>The rebounder passes to one of the open outlet players.</li>

<li>The outlet player passes to a lane player who is breaking to the basket, and makes a
  lay-up. Notice that in this drill, I never used the word dribble. The ball 
should never hit the floor unless there's a bounce pass. The key to this is 
communication. That's why you teach them to yell outlet and lane, so they 
know who has what position. The other important thing is that the lane 
players have to get down the court as fast as they can, or this doesn't work.
  Here's a neat little twist that I wouldn't teach them till 5th 
grade. If the rebounder can throw a baseball pass with an arch, meaning no 
line drives, then the rebounder skips throwing to the outlet player, and 
baseballs it to the lane player. This will catch the defense off guard for a 
while at least.</li></ol>

<p><b>SPEED WINS</b></p>

<p>This little tip works at all ages, but 
works especially well at the younger ages. Here's a typical 3rd-5th games scenario. The other team shoots, misses, and you get the rebound. The other 
team will normally turn and jog back down the court to play defense. If your 
team brings the ball down the court as fast as they can, every time they get 
the ball, they will have the opportunity to shoot many a lay-up. lay-ups are 
good things.Another aspect of this, is that you will wear the other team 
down. When you see a player bent over, leaning on their knees, they are 
tired. When you see a player tugging at their shorts, they are tired. 
Anytime you see an opposing player show the "tired symptoms," get your team 
to go even faster. Speed will win you a lot of games.</p>

<p><b>THE BEST KEPT SECRET ON HOW TO WIN</b></p>

<p>COACH = TEACHER Teach them enough, and they will win.</p>

<p>COACH = TEACHER AND ROLE MODEL</p>
<p>Coaching always boils down to 
priorities. You should be far enough along that when you re-read the opening 
chapter about priorities, you ought to have a clue about what you want to 
accomplish. I want my kids to be winners in life. I want to be a positive 
influence in their lives. I can teach my kids how to win games, that's 
too easy. All I have to do is teach them a couple of the basics, a lot of 
tricks, and enter them into very weak leagues and let them play against 
teams that suck. They will win every game. The Parents From Hell will be 
happy, and the players will have a false sense of "Oh yeah, I'm good." But 
what will you have accomplished? Absolutely nothing! The kids don't learn a 
thing and by 6th grade they will start losing more than they'll 
win.</p>

<p>I want my kids to look back 30 years from now, as this experience 
being one of the best memories they have. I want them to remember how much 
fun they had. I want them to become better individuals because they learned 
that they can work hard, learn the meaning of teamwork, and good 
sportsmanship, and still have fun doing it. This is a chapter about how to 
win, right? I would rather see them win in the game of life and lose a 
basketball game, than win the basketball game but teach them the wrong 
things about life.  What are your kids going to remember 30 years from 
now? They won't remember a single game at this age. What they will 
remember is how you treated them, and was it fun. What is it that your 
players are going to remember about you?</P>

<h3><font color="#0000FF">Chapter 29 - Mirror, Mirror on the Wall - Who's the Most Confused of Them All?</font> </h3>

<p>I know some of you have been scratching your head because I 
left out a word here. I misspelled a word there. Diagrams are wrong, and 
lots of other mistakes. Here's the deal. Whether I originally typed out or 
hand wrote every chapter, the chapters of this Book of Babble are typed out 
to Alaska's, Jackson's, or Powerbasketball's e-mail address by me. (I'm a 2 
finger typist and prone to hitting the wrong key, A LOT!) This would be ok, 
but I usually type these e-mails when I am at work. So I don't normally have 
a lot of time to review or correct the typing errors. It couldn't be that I 
can't spell well, because I just won the spelling bee at my local pub, 
(hiccup.) </p>

<p>Enough excuses, here's another neat thing about this being a 
work in process, I get about 50 e-mails a day asking questions. This let's 
me see what I missed teaching you. So, this is a question - answer chapter 
for some of the more commonly asked questions. Let's see how many misspelled 
words, wrong punctuation errors, and the like you can find. The person with 
the most wins a tootsie roll pop. </p>

<p><b>QUESTION: </b>  "I like your philosophy 
of not teaching them too many offensive plays, but after seeing our opponent 
last night with 3 or 4 good plays, (working to perfection,) I'm wondering if 
we shouldn't be injecting a set offense or at least 1 or 2 plays?" This was 
asked by James who coaches 4th'5th grade boys. </p><p><b>ANSWER:</b> I have been 
asked this question a hundred times in various shapes, forms, and sizes. In 
my iddy biddy bwain, (misspelled on purpose,) it depends on your priorities 
and what stage your team is at. </p><p>Priorities - if they are to win at all 
costs, go to Jackson's site and he's got a bajillion plays you can download. 
If you are there to teach, then make sure <B><U>YOUR WHOLE TEAM</B></U> is 
past the beginners stage and ready for plays. If they aren't, then stay with 
the basics. </p><p>I used my own team as an example. My 8th grade girls team 
still doesn't have a set offensive play. We pick and roll, pass and cut, 
and get a lot of points off of our aggressive m-2-m defense. AND - we 
definitely win more than we lose. Should we have some set plays, probably, 
but my team still learns, wins, and has a lot of fun. It's still a game to 
them. </p>

<p><b>QUESTION:</b> "I am a female asst. coach for my son's 4th grade 
basketball team. The head coach is an ex-high school player who thinks he 
knows it all. He talks for 20 minutes and then expects the boys to know how 
to do everything he has told them, and they don't. Then he starts yelling at 
them. I have read all of your book and I agree that we need to learn the 
fundamentals before we starting piling a lot of plays on them. When I 
mention something to the coach, he just ignores me. I need some help." This 
was sent to me by Laura. </p>
<p><b>ANSWER:</b>  I've gotten over 20 of these types of 
e-mails. This is a major problem with no easy solution. First let me explain 
a fact of kid's land, if I talk to my girls for more than 5 minutes, I lose 
their attention, and they are in 8th grade. 4th graders probably have a 2 
minute attention span. Riley's Rule # 28 = When you see your player's 
eyeballs rolling in their heads, quit talking! </p><p>1.  I would 1st try 
the honey vs. vinegar approach. I.E. "You know, you have some wonderful 
plays that the boys need to learn. Why don't we split up the practices, he 
won't know what a LS is, and I'll work with them on some basic skills like 
ball handling, lay-ups, and stuff like that. You take the 2nd half of 
practice and teach them the more exciting and advanced things, like plays." 
</p><p>Make teaching the basics out to be dull, dreary, and something he would 
probably hate doing. Make his stage of the teaching seem more exciting. 
Maybe he'll go for it. </p><p>2.  If #1 doesn't work, get gym time for a 
second practice and you teach them the basics. Print my book off of the net, 
hand it to him, and tell him the kids need to learn the basics. </p><p>3. 
 If #'s 1 & 2 don't work, remember the invisible sign over every gym door, 
NO WEAK SISTERS ALLOWED. Sooooooo -take control and FIRE HIM! </p><p>Two 
summers ago I started an AAU club. I had 238 girls play ball for me. My wife 
coached a team of girls that no one wanted. They were cut by all the other 
teams. Another parent agreed to co-coach with her. After the second LS, she 
called him up and fired him. He had just as much authority as she did, but 
she took control and fired his screaming butt. It wasn't easy and it took a 
lot of guts, but 3 of her players now play for my advanced team and are 
great players. The end result was worth it. </p><p>Get together with enough 
parents, on the side, and explain to them that you believe that the kids 
need to be taught the fundamentals and you plan on firing the head coach. 
Get some people behind you, then just do it. One of three things will 
happen. He will quit and take his kid with him. Or, he will quit but leave 
his kid on the team. Or, he won't quit and the parents don't back you 
publicly, so you may have to quit and find another team for your son to play 
on. There are too many teams out there to put up with a bunch of nonsense. 
</p><p>Ok, this seems a little drastic, right? Wrong!!!! Coaches can make or 
break a child. I would rather my daughter not play for a season than hook up 
with the wrong coach. I know, I had one in jr. high that affected me for 
years. Remember, you have just entered the wonderful world of macholand. NO 
WEAK SISTERS ALLOWED. </p><p><b>QUESTION: </b>  I can't get the drill Ring Of Fire 
to work. What am I missing? </p><p><b>ANSWER: </b>  Draw a pie on a piece of paper. Now 
draw lines and divide the pie into 6 pieces, and number the pieces 1-6. In 
the center of the pie draw a small circle. The small circle is the player in 
the middle who catches and passes. Let's call this player M, for middle. 
Start  with M holding a ball and #1 holding a ball. Here's the sequence. 
</p><p>M passes to #2.  #1 passes to M. M catches and passes to #3, as #2 
passes to M. M catches #2's pass and passes to #4, as #3 passes to M. etc. etc.
etc. </p><p><b>QUESTION:</b>  One thing I want to improve on is making quicker 
passes. How can I improve their reaction time? </p><p><b>ANSWER: </b>  Two drills. 
One is Ring Of Fire. The other is 4 Passes and Score Drill.  For this drill 
get 2 kids standing on the baseline about 12' apart. They must go the length 
of the court by passing it to each other without dribbling. They must go the 
entire length of the court and are only allowed to pass the ball to each 
other 4 times. Then they are allowed one dribble for a lay-up and must SCORE. 
Also, they are not allowed to travel, or walk with the ball. </p><p>Now let 
me take a moment to explain the difference between shooting and SCORING. 
Shooting is where you take a shot. Scoring is where the involved players 
keep on rebounding and shooting till they score. No one on my team is 
allowed to move on to the next drill until they score. If they take a shot, 
they must follow it up and keep on rebounding and shooting until they do 
score. This improves their rebounding, following up their own shot, and 
shooting skills. It's a drill, without being a drill. </p><p><b>QUESTION: </b>  I 
have 2 players that if I turn them loose could win every game for me. Should 
I let them play their game? </p><p><b>ANSWER: </b>  If you do, then take a seat in the 
stands because you have just given up your coach's scepter. Ok, so you have 
2 wonderfully gifted natural athletes, big deal. I've seen 100's of Jimmy 
and Johnny shows. They pass to each other, are extremely gifted and win 
games for you. So what?? If they were of varsity age I'd say, "That's cool." 
These are younger kids. Do they personally learn anything that will make 
them even better? No! </p><p>Here's an even bigger point, what about the other 
6-8 kids on your team. They will never get to touch the ball. What are you 
teaching them? Are they learning the game? And as a role model what are you 
teaching them? Are you teaching them teamwork and good sportsmanship? And 
what happens when you come up against a team that plays as a team? I'll tell 
you what happens, you're screwed. You lose by 40 points. </p>
<p>COACH = TEACHER  Take these naturally gifted kids and turn them into real players 
along with the rest of your team. They will thank you in the long run. 
</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:</b>  I have a parent who is constantly telling me his kid needs 
more PT, playing time. His child is a good player and I am tempted to give 
in. What should I do?? </p>
<p><b>ANSWER:</b>  It depends upon your priorities. If 
winning is your #1 goal, play the kid more. If your goal is to be a teacher 
of the game, remind the parent of your equal playing time policy and thank 
them for their concern. THEN WALK AWAY. Don't have a long drawn out 
conversation. Let them talk to the back of your head as you walk away. Do 
not get into a debate with the parent, you'll lose every time.</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF">CHAPTER 30 - I'VE GOT THE M-2-M BLUES</font> </h3>

<p>Your season must 
be in full swing because I've received at least 100 e-mails about m-2-m 
defense. It seems that most of the teams you play are using a zone defense, 
and you are losing your games because of it. The common thread appears to 
be, why can't I switch to a zone defense? Let me tell you a story and see if 
this helps. </p><p>I have a friend that I coach against , named Pat. For the 
last 2 years he has taken his team to the city-county finals of the catholic 
league. Let me put this into perspective. This league has at least six 
districts, and 3 to four divisions in each district, and this is per grade. 
So there are about 180 teams playing in each age group. He has been the 
second best team out of 180 teams for the last 2 years in a row. So, let's 
just say he has a very nice team. </p><p>My team plays his about 3 times a 
year, and every game is a barn burner and we take turns winning. FYI, I'm 
not in that league. We played his team 2 weeks ago and his team played worse 
than I could ever have imagined. It was obvious within the first few minutes 
that my team was going to win. The next day I  called and asked him what 
happened to his team. He laughed and explained what he was doing. 
</p><p>Every year he had his team playing a 1-3-1 or a 2-3 zone defense. His 
girls were great at it and you really had to be on top of your game just to 
compete with him. This year he was teaching his girls m-2-m defense. He 
waited until they were in 8th grade, to teach them man-2-man. I have watched 
2 more of his games since then, and he lost both of those. </p><p>So why 
not revert back to his winning ways? He says because if his girls ever want 
to make a high school team, they have to learn man-2-man defense. Imagine 
how these girls, who have the reputation for winning, are having to swallow 
their pride now. I honestly feel sorry for them. I will give them credit, 
they are handling it very well. </p><p>I don't respect a single win he has had 
in the past, compared to how much I respect him for putting his girls 
basketball futures ahead of his own ego. If you think it's hard for you to 
see your team lose at their age, how much harder would it be for you to try 
to explain to your players, and their "Parents from hell," why they should 
learn m-2-m after they had been one of the best non-select teams in the city 
for 5 years in a row?   </p><p>Very few coaches would do what Pat is now doing 
because they are in search of the almighty win. Riley's Rule # 00 = Most 
youth coaches start out coaching for the right reason, then become 
egotistical power mongers. We all start out coaching for the kids. Most 
coaches end up coaching because of their own secret agenda, their own ego. 
</p><p>How do I look at Pat? PAT IS MY HERO! Here is a person who is standing 
up, taking a bunch of crap, simply because he realizes that he should have 
started off teaching m-2-m defense and didn't. Instead of hiding from that 
fact, he is now trying to help his girls the best he can, by teaching them 
m-2-m now. Is it too late for some of his girls, yep. It's hard to teach an 
old dog new tricks. But it's not too late for all them. Wanna know something 
else, <B>IT'S NOT TOO LATE FOR YOU!!!!</B> </p><p>I know you are frustrated 
and maybe even taking some heat from the parents. By the way, pretty soon 
you will understand why I call them the "Parents From Hell." The point is 
you need to stick to your game plan. </p><p>Think of it this way. A man is 
walking down the street in front of you. No one else is on this street. No 
one else sees you or him. He drops a bag without realizing it. You pick it 
up and there are 100 dollar bills falling out of it. Do you do the right 
thing and run after him and give it back? We all say we would, but we never 
know until we are in that position. What if you were behind on your mortgage 
and in trouble at work, now would you give it back? Doing the right thing 
isn't always easy. </p><p>When you learned to ride a bike you probably fell off 
of it a dozen times and hurt yourself. Why didn't you quit trying to a ride 
a bike after all of those falls? Normally, it's because your parents 
wouldn't let you quit trying. Now you can ride a bike. You wouldn't trade 
all of the pleasure you had when you were young riding your bike, for 
anything. As a coach you are like your own parent who wouldn't let you quit 
trying. If you do the right thing, these kids will thank you in their later 
years. Do the right thing. </p><p>I don't know how to make a more passionate 
plea. There are people in life who walk toward the light. Then there are 
people who go over to the dark side. Want to know how they get started toward 
the dark side? By taking the first step. </p><p>That first step toward the dark
side in basketball seems harmless. "My teams not winning, so I'll teach 
them a little zone defense. After we win a game or two, I'll go back to 
teaching them m-2-m."  The sad thing is that 99% of the coaches in the world 
don't have Pat's courage or love for his players. 99% of the coaches never 
teach their players good solid m-2-m defense because it stands in the way of 
them winning their next game. We are a right now society, and that's not a 
good thing. </p><p>One last thing, I want to thank all of the folks at 
www.powerbasketball.com for letting me share this book with you. They are 
the most recent site to post it for you. Remember, please e-mail the site 
where you found this and thank them for their time, energy, space, and 
patience for putting up with me. </p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF">CHAPTER 31 = WHO YA GONNA CALL?  ZONE BUSTERS!</font></h3>
<p>So you're down in 
the dumps just a little bit. You can handle the fact that your dog hates 
you, your boss hates you, and the horse you bet on came in 4th. What you 
can't handle, is watching your team suffer against these coaches who think 
they are Super Coach. They are great because their team plays a zone and 
they win their games.</p>
<p>Now before I go into the next part, I want you to 
do something for me. Sit straight up in your chair. Come on, you can do it. 
No slouching! Now stick out your chest very exaggeratedly. Head up! Come on 
now, humor me. Now keep this posture while you read the next section. 
Remember, it's the Christmas season, and I have Santa's twin brother here. 
His name is St. Mortimer and he can tell if you are following the 
directions. So sit straight, head up, and chest out. When you read this, 
read it out loud like a tv announcer would, in a low distinquished voice. 
And do not read this in a monotone voice, put some juice and excitement into 
it.  Ready?</p>
<p>It's not the players who win these games, it's HIM/HER, 
it's .... Super Coach. Super Coach is king of all he/she surveys. See the 
kids play their hearts out? They play for him, Super Coach. If one of his 
players mess up in a game, Super Coach knows what to do. Super Coach jerks 
the kid out of the game and benches them. Super Coach then looks at the 
player that is going into the game. </p>
<p>"If you make the same mistake as 
this unlucky soul," Super Coach yells to the sub as he points to the kid 
that just came out of the game. "Then you will suffer the same horrible fate 
as this dweeb."</p>
<p>Super Coach knows what to do and how to motivate 
children. Super coach makes his players fear him. Who  is able to jump off 
the bench faster than a speeding bullet? Whose lungs are more powerful than 
a locomotive? Able to leap  tall buildings in a single bound to make sure 
you do everything he screams at you to do? IT'S SUPER COACH !!</p>
<p>And 
who are we? Why we are meek and mild mannered Clark Kent. Every week, we 
Clark Kents have to go into the gladiator's arena and play against Super 
Coach. Everyweek we come out of that arena with our tail between our legs 
and what is Super Coach doing? Gloating! "See how MY GREAT ZONE DEFENSE beat 
you, Clark Kent! No one beats Super Coach!!!!!</p><p>Now sing along to the 
tune of Ghost Busters.</p>

<p>When there's something wrong - </p>
<p>in your neighborhood - </p>
<p>who ya gonna call? </p>
<p>ZONE BUSTERS!!!!</p>

<p>There 
are lots of complicated plays that will bust up a zone, but you, Clark Kent, 
coach younger kids with a 2 minute attention span. Complicated is a bad 
thing! Simple is a Good Thing! So here is your kryptonite so you have a 
chance against Super Coach. </p>
<p>Here's a secret. Hopefully this comes 
out in a small font like I am typing it, because secrets should be in 
smaller type. Coaches hide their weakest defensive players on the left side 
of the basket. </p>
<p>There, now you know something about Super Coach. 
Knowledge is Power. Now you hold your 1st piece of kryptonite. The first 
thing you do against a zone is attack the left side. I guarantee you that if 
Super Coach's zone has a weakness this is it. </p>
<p>Want another piece of 
kryptonite? OK! Overload his left side! You've heard of overweight, overfed, 
and overtaxed, but you aren't familiar with overload? This is where you have 
3 of your offensive players on the left side of the basket. Have these 
players constantly move to get open and make sure they don't stand in the 
paint for over 3 seconds. When one of them finally gets passed to, the other 
2 players in that area screen the defensive player or players. At this age, 
you should be able to get a clear shot from within 10' of the basket about 
70% of the time. Overload is a Good Thing! Overload can beat Super 
Coach.</p><p>Want another piece of kryptonite? Let's try passing around the 
zone. Here's a simple little drill. </p>

<ol><li>Keep a forward  close to 
the basket where they are running from one side of the paint to the other. 
They look for a pass, or for the rebound if another player 
shoots.</li>
<li>Keep a forward at the freethrow line running from one end of 
the freethrow line to the other. They receive passes and look for a cutter 
or an open shot.</li>
<li>Your other 3 players play pass and cut just 
outside of their zone. They can also pass to the player on the freethhrow 
line and then cut to the basket. The whole time you are doing this, your 
players are having fun, and Super Coach's players are running their tails 
off to catch up with yiour passes. If your players can be patient, someone 
will end up wide open for a layup. The secret is the person with the ball 
has to keep their head up and look for the pass.</li></ol>
<p>These are 2 simple 
Zone Busters. If you will teach your players these 2 simple ideas or plays, 
you can then become ZONE BUSTER. And Super Coach doesn't have a chance 
against ZONE BUSTER!! You will be King of all you survey - but - you never 
deserted your m-2-m defense. You have now become a TEACHER OF THE 
GAME!!!!!</p>
<p>I hope I gave you enough so you can TEACH YOUR KIDS HOW TO WIN 
THEIR NEXT GAME.</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF">CHAPTER 32 - Is there life after the regular season?</font> </h3>
<p>So there are a few of you that I didn't scare off with my last chapter. 
I admit I was OUT THERE with my Super Coach approach. The thing is I bored 
myself with the previous several chapters, so I know I had to have bored 
you. Sometimes you just have to say what the heck, it's time to have some 
fun. Chapter 30 was fun for me. Thanks for staying with me.   </p>
<p>In all 
honesty, I have given you everything you need for your first year. Some of 
it will work for you, some of it won't. I started out trying to make it so 
you didn't seem like a pocket protector toting dweeb. I wanted you to have 
enough confidence that you could actually teach your kids the fundamentals, 
without stuttering or becoming an alcoholic. I have tried to give you enough 
info so that you could become a teacher. </p>
<p>I have never hidden my second 
agenda, I have tried to influence your present and future definition of 
coach. COACH = TEACHER AND ROLE MODEL. With all my heart I believe that this 
is the perfect definition of a coach. I have tried to instill my belief 
system. Whether I have succeeded, only time will tell. I believe that this 
is a game for the kids and should always remain FOR THE KIDS. They don't 
sign up to be yelled at or picked on. Kids sign up to play a game, and games 
are supposed to be fun. </p>
<p>So what is left for me to teach you - HOW TO 
AVOID THE POST-SEASON BLUES! Yes, Susan, there is a Santa Claus! And there 
is basketball life after the regular season ends.  This section is 
definitely not for everyone. At the end of your regular season, you may get 
down on your knees, face Mecca, and be thankful that it's over. But there 
are some of you that will be sad. Your will visit your local shrink at 
O'Rileys Pub, and cry in your beer. Some of you will want it to go on, and 
on, and on, and ..... You will be living proof that I am not the only sick 
puppy in the world. </p>
<p>After the regular season ends, you need to find out 
about the post season local leagues and tournaments. Here's how you find 
your info: </p>

<ol>
<li>Check your local and city newspapers</li>
<li>Ask the league coordinator of the league you just played in</li>
<li>Throughout your regular season, make friends with the coaches you play against and ask them if they know of any. </li>
<li>Network - get the name and phone # of every coach and player you can</li> 
<li>Ask you high schools Athletic Director and coaches if they know of any </li>
</ol>

<p>These will get you started. A lot of them require 
you to do some homework throughout your regular season. Oh well, no rest for 
the weary. Just keep asking everyone you meet, if they know of any spring,
summer, and fall leagues. Sooner or later, you'll find some games. 
</p>
<p>Then there's AAU. AAU is a set of national and regional tourneys. It is 
not a way to play a lot more games. You play a 2 or 3 game qualifying 
tournament, and if you don't qualify, the AAU is over for you. The exception 
to this is the older  AAU traveling road teams. These teams play in tourneys 
all over the country. At the 3-8th grade levels, it's just not worth the 
money to travel. </p>
<p>Once you find a place to play, then you need to 
figure out who you want to play for you. Do you want your regular school 
team? Do you want to put a select team together of the better players from 
different teams? Do you want to keep part of your team and just fill in the 
holes with other players? This is all up to you.  I won't tell you what to 
do, this is 100% whatever you want to do. </p>
<p>The hardest part about off 
season is finding gym time for your LS's. Go back to the beginning of this 
book to the chapter that dealt with finding gym time. Re-read this chapter 
and then hit the phones. </p>
<p>Who is the off season for? It's for the kids 
who want to play. It's for the kids who want to get better. It's for the 
kids who want to play ball in high school. BASKETBALL PLAYERS ARE MADE IN 
THE SUMMER. TEAMS ARE MADE IN THE WINTER! </p>
<p>My girls started in 5th 
grade and have played ball 11 months a year ever since. At times this seems 
like it's going to overwhelm me and the girls, but I wouldn't trade these 
times and memories for anything. I have spent quality time with my own 
daughter, that I probably wouldn't have spent with her otherwise. Is the off 
season for everyone, no! The off season is only for those brave souls who 
have already had their lobotomy. Before you commit to the off season, make 
sure you are not prone to alcoholism. AND - make sure your marriage is on a 
firm foundation because this will sorely test you and your marriage. 
</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF">CHAPTER 33 - All Presents should be neatly wrapped with a bow.</font></h3>

<p>Basketball Encarta, that's what I call Alaska 
Coach's and Coach Larry Dean Jackson's websites. Only problem is that Coach 
Jackson's site on tripod went down. After listening to them tell him he 
never had a site on tripod, he switched servers. His new address is: 
</p>

<p>www.geocities.com/ljacksonesc5/acoach.html</p><p>When I go there I 
don't use capitalized letters, but it probably doesn't matter. LD's site has 
more plays than any site I've seen. He's my X's and O's library. When he 
lost his site on tripod, he lost his audience but now you know how to get 
there. Try it, you'll like it. </p>

<p>It's early in the morning on Dec. 24th, 
2000. My wife and daughter are a sleep and it's almost X-mas. This is my 
quiet time when I can look back over the year and  think, "Man am I glad 
this one is over!" I've done a lot of things wrong this year. I haven't gone 
home to Lexington, Kentucky to see my mom, sisters,  nieces, and their kids 
enough. Between working 60 hours a week and basketball the rest of my waking 
hours, I haven't spent enough quality time with my own family.  Ok, 
sometimes I can be a true s**t. Yes, I'm allowed to swear because it's my 
book! (sorry, not on this site - grin - Steve)</p>

<p>The biggest event this year was my father dying in Feb. Talk about 
a wake up call. This made me think a lot about those idiotic cliches like 
"Why am I here?"  and "If I were to die right now, what difference would my 
life have made?" </p>

<p>Now you are saying to yourself, "This guy has lost 
it. He is even further out in left field, than he was when he did the Super 
Coach chapter." No, I'm still with you. </p>
<p>My point is  that 16 years 
ago I met Jennifer and got married. My getting married to my best friend 
doesn't change the world. But this was a part of something that made a 
difference, my wife and I had Crash, our daughter. In some way, this changes 
the world. She will be something that I helped make a difference with. 
</p>

<p>Next, there's my extended family, the girls who play for me. I have 
tried very hard to let sports teach them teamwork and the value of good 
sportsmanship. I believe this can make a difference in the world. 
</p>

<p>And last, there's my Christmas present to you folks, and that is this 
book. If this book helps you, to  believe in your heart and soul that COACH 
= TEACHER AND ROLE MODEL, then I will have made a difference. Riley's Kudo = 
we are only vertical for so long, then we are horizontal forever. We should 
have as much fun as the law allows, and still be able to make a positive 
difference in another's life. IF YOU CAN'T HAVE FUN, YOU ARE IN THE WRONG 
PLACE! Basketball can be a state of mind where you can have fun and bring 
others into your playland with you. If you teach and have fun, so will 
everyone else. Ok, I'm rambling, so here's a silly X-mas present for you. 
</p>

<h3>ODE OF A X-MAS KID</h3> 

<p>TWAS THE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS <br>
TOURNAMENT CHAMPIONSHIP DAY <br>
MY TEAM HAD PREPARED <br>
AND WERE READY TO PLAY <br>
MY 4TH GRADE KIDS <br>
HAD PRACTICED SO HARD <br>
THEY'D RUN THEIR LEGS OFF <br>
THESE FORWARDS AND GUARDS </p>

<p>THEY'D PRACTICED AND LEARNED <br>
THE GIVE AND THE GO <br>
THE PASS AND CUT <br>
AND EVEN FREETHROWS <br>
THEY'D STOOP AND THEY'D CROUCH <br>
TO LEARN TRIPLE THREATS <br>
MY KIDS WORKED HARDER <br>
THAN A MAN WITH HUGE DEBTS </p>

<p>MY TEAM WAS PREPARED <br>
AND READY TO PLAY <br>
THIS WAS THEIR MOMENT <br>
THIS WAS THEIR DAY <br>
WE GOT TO THE GYM <br>
A LITTLE BIT EARLY <br>
BECAUSE THE WEATHER FORECAST <br>
WAS CALLING FOR FLURRIES </p>


<p>WITH 5 MINUTES TO GO <br>
BEFORE THE GAME STARTED <br>
THE SKIES OPENED UP <br>
WITH SNOWFLAKES THAT DARTED <br>
THE GYM WAS BRAND NEW <br>
WITH REAL BIG GLASS DOORS <br>
WITH PLENTY OF WINDOWS <br>
YOU COULD SEE FROM THE FLOOR </p>


<p>THE REF TOSSED THE BALL <br>
AND WE GOT THE TIP <br>
I FELT COZY AND WARM <br>
LIKE A FLORIDA TRIP <br>
THE GAME WAS FAST PACED <br>
BACK AND FORTH THE SCORE WENT <br>
AT HALF YOU COULD SEE <br>
THAT BOTH TEAMS WERE SPENT </p>


<p>THE REF STARED AT THE DOORS <br>
WHILE WEARING A FROWN <br>
HE WINCED AS HE STARED <br>
AT THE SNOW COMING DOWN <br>
SECOND HALF STARTED <br>
AS FAST AS THE FIRST <br>
EACH TEAM WAS SCORING <br>
IN OPPOSITE BURSTS</p>


<p>WE SCORED OUR TWO <br>
THEN THEY GOT THEIR FOUR <br>
THEN THEY GOT TWO <br>
WHILE WE GOT FOUR MORE <br>
BOTH TEAMS PLAYED WELL <br>
BACK AND FORTH THE LEAD WENT <br>
FREETHROWS AND LAYUPS <br>
WERE LIKE MONEY SPENT </p>


<p>NOW WE HAD THE LEAD <br>
NOW THEY TOOK IT BACK <br>
LIKE A SEESAW THAT HELD <br>
TWO EQUAL SACKS <br>
MEANWHILE THE SNOW FELL <br>
WITH NO RHYTHM OR STYLE <br>
EXCEPT TO CREATE <br>
SOME HUMONGOUS PILES </p>


<p>THE REFS MISSED SOME CALLS <br>
THEY'D NORMALLY HAVE MADE <br>
AS THEY  STARED AT THE DOORS <br>
INSTEAD OF WHO PLAYED <br>
ONE QUARTER TO GO <br>
JUST SEVEN MINUTES MORE <br>
NO ONE WAS AHEAD <br>
TWAS A DEAD EVEN SCORE </p>


<p>THE OPPOSING COACH AND I PACED <br>
IN OUR OWN SEPERATE BOX <br>
I COULD FEEL MYSELF SWEAT <br>
EVEN DOWN TO MY SOCKS <br>
THIS WAS TOURNAMENT DAY <br>
THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME <br>
EVERYTHING ELSE <br>
SEEMED FAIRLY LAME </p>


<p>THE REF LOOKED AT ME <br>
AND OLE WHAT'S HIS NAME <br>
THEN  -  HE BLEW HIS WHISTLE <br>
AND CALLED IT A GAME <br>
I FELL TO THE FLOOR <br>
NOT BELIEVING MY EARS <br>
WE'D PRACTICED SO HARD <br>
FOR WHAT SEEMED LIKE A YEAR </p>


<p>20 TO 20 <br>
THAT'S HOW THE SCORE READ <br>
20 TO 20 <br>
BEAT IN MY HEAD <br>
BOTH TEAMS HAD PRACTICED <br>
SO HARD AND SO LONG <br>
TO END IN A TIE <br>
SURELY SEEMED WRONG </p>



<p>BOTH TEAMS HAD BATTLED <br>
AS IF THEY WERE CHAMPS <br>
TO END IT LIKE THIS <br>
WAS LIKE TIGHTENING THE CLAMPS <br>
THE KIDS WERE ALL SMILING <br>
INSTEAD OF DOWNCAST <br>
CAUSE THEY KNEW THE GAME <br>
WAS A THING OF THE PAST </p>



<p>THEY KEPT LAUGHING AND POINTING <br>
AS THE SNOW HIT THE GROUND <br>
BIG HEAVY SNOWFLAKES <br>
THAT FORMED INTO MOUNDS <br>
VISIONS OF SLEDDING AND SNOWFIGHTS <br>
IS ALL THAT THEY SAW <br>
SNOWFORTS AND SNOWMEN <br>
AND MAKING SNOWBALLS </p>


<p>WHO CARED ABOUT BASKETBALL<br>
AND WHO WON THE GAME <br>
SNOW WAS THE BUZZWORD <br>
ALL ELSE SEEMED SO TAME <br>
THE SCORE WAS TIED UP <br>
THE REF CALLED IT QUITS <br>
BOTH TEAMS WERE WINNERS <br>
AND MAYBE THAT FITS </p>


<p>IF I WERE A KID <br>
CHOOSING FREETHROWS OR SNOW <br>
THERE'S CERTAINLY NO DOUBT <br>
WHICH WAY I'D GO <br>
GIVE ME A FORT <br>
A SNOWBALL IN MY HAND <br>
THE SNOW COMING DOWN <br>
I'M KING OF THE LAND </p>


<p>IT'S COACHES WHO LOOK <br>
FOR THEIR PLACE IN THE SUN <br>
BUT KIDS ARE JUST KIDS <br>
THEY'RE JUST LOOKING FOR FUN <br>
I TURNED TO THE REF <br>
BUT HE WASN'T THERE <br>
SOMEONE SAID <br>
HE'S CHANGING DOWNSTAIRS </p>


<p>I WENT DOWN THE STAIRS <br>
TO SAY THANKS FOR IT ALL <br>
WHEN I FOUND HIM I NOTICED <br>
HE WASN'T VERY TALL <br>
A CUTE LITTLE GUY <br>
WITH A BIG BULBOUS NOSE <br>
WORE WIRE-RIMMED GLASSES <br>
AND WORE ALL RED CLOTHES </p>


<p>SHINY BLACK BOOTS <br>
AND A REAL BIG WIDE BELT <br>
A TINY WHITE BEARD <br>
A RED COAT MADE OF FELT <br>
I TURNED BEFORE HE SAW ME <br>
AND GOT OUT OF SIGHT <br>
I JUST COULDN'T BOTHER HIM <br>
ON HIS GRANDEST OF NIGHTS </p>


<p>I FOUND SOMETHING THAT NIGHT <br>
ABOUT THE ALMIGHT WIN <br>
HOW YOU GET IT <br>
JUST MIGHT BE A SIN <br>
IF YOUR KIDS RAN THEIR HEARTS OUT <br>
AND GAVE IT THEIR ALL <br>
THEY ALL COME UP WINNERS <br>
IN THE GAME OF ROUND BALL </p>


<p>AS A COACH YOU CAN STAND <br>
IN THE DARK OR THE LIGHT, <br>
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL <br>
AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT !!! </p>

<h2>Chapter 34 = Parsley May Make It Look Better, But Who Would Eat It ???? </h2>  <P>

Jennifer and I take Crash to a restaurant on The Hill, here in St. Louis.  
For those of you who aren't from here, The Hill is a district that has some 
of the finest restaurants in the state. My wife and I order veal oscar. The 
presentation is excellent. (Notice, I'm using 50 cent words that apply to the 
restaurant business, just simply amazing!) It's a thin slice of veal with 
crab on top, topped with a sauce. Asparagus adorns the plate. It looks great! 
Crash orders a hamburger, medium rare, with american cheese. <P>

What does this have to do with basketball, you ask. As adults, my wife and I 
have more "cultivated" tastes and enjoy the appearance of the food. My 13 
year old daughter's tastes are simple and uncomplicated =  gimme a burger and 
fries and 86 the rest of the garden stuff.  As coaches we can learn a lot 
from this analogy. <P>

Coaches want their teams to appear well trained with sophisticated and 
complicated plays. Kids just want to play a game. The secret to coaching is 
to be able to teach the kids the game, while still keeping it a game. And 
remember, games are supposed to be fun. <P>

Even as we speak, I am hosting my own tournament, both 5-on-5 and full court 
3-on-3 for 8th grade girls. There are 16 teams who are playing. When a coach 
is waiting for their next game, they will huddle together with the other 
coaches, and compare notes. I sat in while some of the coaches compared notes 
about their flex offense, and their motion offense, and their 1-3-1 offense, 
and the ole what's it's name offense. This is like the veal oscar and it's 
presentation. To listen to these folks, you would thing it was a convention 
of college coaches. They were totally impressive with how they talked about 
the various offenses. <P>

Now in reality, I'm a meat and potatoes kind of guy.  My coaching is the same 
way. As I've told you before, my team does not have any set offense. We don't 
run patterns, we don't have specific plays that we learn. So you can imagine 
that I was somewhat impressed by the coach's conversation. There was one 
coach who was extremely vocal about the fact that his team had three 
different offenses that they used to keep the other teams off balance. My 
next game was against this coach. Let's call this coach Bob. <P>

I did not change my gameplan for this game at all. I told my girls to play a 
hard physical game, play man-2-man defense, and I'd like to see a little more 
passing than the last game. Bob had 3 different offenses alright. When the 
first one failed, he went to the second offense, and when that one failed he 
went to his third one. His girls knew their offenses, but when they went up 
against a hard m-2-m defense, it took them out of their rhythm. His girls 
ended up in the wrong spot, or were 2 seconds too late in getting to their 
spot. You've heard of common sense? Well, his girls had no basketball sense. 
They didn't know what to do if their offense was out of sync. They couldn't 
think on their feet. <P>

At half time the score was 27 -2, we were winning. Three different 
complicated offenses and yet they couldn't score. That team's problem was 
that his kids knew a lot about those offenses, and very little about the 
fundamentals of the game. I don't believe in running up a score, so I held my 
girls back the second half and we won 45 to 20. <P>

Here's the funny part. After the game, Bob came up to me and asked me what 
the name of our offense was. He had no clue !  He should have asked us what 
our defense was because I'm sure he thought that it was some new hi-folluting 
laboratory designed defense with a 50 cent word for a name. I told him not to 
tell anyone, but we had just learned the new P-C offense, mixed with the P-R 
offense. He nodded his head up and down judicitiously as if he had heard of 
it. By the way P-C stands for pass and cut, and P-R stands for pick and roll. <P>

Bob is the veal oscar. He tried to introduce adult tastes and appearances 
before his kid's taste buds were ready for it. My kids were the burger and 
fries, uncomplicated and knew the game. <P>

So that brings me to the next point, YOU FOLKS! I have tried to teach you how 
to make your LS's fun. I have given you enough simple drills for younger kids 
to learn. Don't be the veal oscar. If you can teach your kids to handle a 
basketball, how to pass to a target,  how to make layups, the correct 
shooting form, m-2-m defense, proper footwork, how to communicate on the 
floor, how to keep their head up when they dribble, how to set a good screen 
that seals, how to block out and rebound, and if you can teach them this all 
in the first year, you are a better teacher than I am Charlie Brown. <P>

You have enough info to drown an elephant, you just don't know it. Don't keep 
looking for that magic wand, you are the magic wand. It's not the neat 
offenses and defenses that win games at this age, it's man-2-man defense and 
teaching the basics of the game. Don't be the veal oscar. It may look good 
with that sprig of parsley on top, but who eats parsley?<P> 



I really need to clarify a point here. I am not advocating that you never 
need to learn a set offense, plays, X's and O's, or whatever. There is a time 
and place for patterned offenses, I just don't happen to believe that 3rd - 
5th grade happens to be the time or the place. As you have probably learned 
by now, gym time is your most treasured resource. I believe that whatever 
little gym time you have, should be spent teaching your kids the basics, not 
wasted on learning set offenses that won't help them grow as an individual. <P>

Let me change the timing here, slightly. You  should start learning set 
offenses and zone defenses when: <P>

1.   Your team can make 7 out of ten layups, natural hand, at full speed <P>

2.   When they can make 5 out of 10 layups with their opposite hand <P>

3.   When they can play a full court pressing m-2-m defense, and not lose 
their player <P>

4.   When every member of your team can lead the fast break and make it 7 out 
of 10 times <P>

5.   When every member of your team can dribble with their head up <P>

6.   When your team can shoot with their shoulders squared to the basket, and 
use the correct shooting form <P>

7.   When your team uses the proper footwork and spacing on their m-2-m 
defense <P>

8.   When you have finally decided that the kids are not going to take this 
sport seriously and you have lost too many games by 30 points or more <P>

You wanna know something, I just looked over this list and I missed one . How 
about when the cows come home???? My team plays about 80-100 games a year, 
and we have probably played over 150 different teams. Not one of these teams 
could meet the qualifiers I just gave you. So, ok, I'll revise it. When 70% 
of your team can do the above, then it's time for a set offense and defense. 
See, I can be a reasonable type of fellow. <P>

Please understand that what I am about to say puts me in the minority. In 
fact, there's probably only 3 people in the whole world who will agree with 
this, and that's me, myself, and I. I really don't know of a single coach who 
would agree with what I am about to say, so here's from the "For what it's 
worth 
department!" <P>

I honestly don't know that as long as teaching is your number one goal, you 
should ever use a set offense or defense more than 15% of the time. Once the 
kids hit 9th grade, then let their freshman coach teach them his offense and 
defense. Until then, I personally would not use them unless needed. <P>

I know that LD and Alaska and some of my other buddies are shaking their 
heads about now. Why? Because every once in a while in a moment of weakness, 
I will ask them about what offenses and defenses I should teach my kids. We 
all have our moments where we wish we had that magic wand. I have to remind 
myself that when my team is off of their game, I need to go back to the 
basics. Basics wins games, and teaches the kids at the same time. It all goes 
back to what I talked about in the beginning, what are your priorities? <P>

Let me tell you a little story. I told you in the beginning I don't have a 
long list of credentials. In fact I was honest about not even having a 
resume. But here's what teaching the basics can do. Plus there are a few 
other lessons to be learned from this story. <P>

Every summer, Nike has basketball camps at various places around the country. 
Crash and one her buddies went to the one in Chicago this past summer. They 
spent 5 days at a college campus doing b-ball from 9 am till 9 pm. They 
learn, they have individual contests, team contests, and get to eat that 
wonderful glop, known as college cafeteria food. (Doesn't that just tittilate 
your taste buds?) <P>

Remember, these are 12 year olds getting ready to go into 8th grade. (Both 
kids are young for their grade.) Crash wins the 1-on-1 contest for the 12-14 
year olds. This means that out of between 70 to 100 real basketball players 
of the same age, Crash was the best on that given day. <P>

Emily, Crash's buddy and team mate, was good enough that they moved her up to 
play varsity with the 16-18 year olds. And she helped her team win the 3-on-3 
championship against varsity girls. This was a 12 year old playing against 16 
& 17 year old kids. 
<P>
How were they able to achieve this? They knew and could execute the basics. 
Forget about fancy smancy, teach your kids the basics and you will never ever 
regret it. <P>

I told you there were other lessons to be learned from this. Here's another 
one. A little background first. College coaches run these camps, with the 
help of some very good high school coaches. The kids who attend these camps 
are normally very good players. What parent would spend close to $800 to send 
their child to a camp, if the kid didn't have the desire and some ability? <P>

Now for the lesson. They let the girls play the game. Basketball is a very 
physical sport, and these college coaches let the kids play. The camp started 
out with one trainer to look after the wounded. I believe they ended up with 
3 before it was all over. When I got there to pick up Crash, the place looked 
like a mash unit. There were more girls with band-aids, knee wraps, taped 
fingers, ankle and knee braces, and more. One girl broke her ankle, another 
her wrist, and Crash broke 2 fingers. A kid would get hurt, run to the 
trainer and say "Tape me!"  They didn't whine or complain, they just wanted 
to go back out onto to the court and play some more. <P>

For those of you who are in leagues where the refs wear a sign that says, "If 
you touch, you foul," this is not basketball. Basketball is taking your butt 
and moving someone out of position. Basketball is a bunch of bodies battling 
for the rebound. Basketball is a hard physical game. <P>

Let's get back to the basics vs. set offenses and defenses. I believe I was 
advocating my philosophy of not going too heavily into X's and O's until 9th 
grade, right? <P>

So why am I going into the basics as much as I am? Because if the average 
coach has ten steps to success, and in order 1-10, they always want to skip 
steps 2-6 and get to step 7 too soon. The average coach will introduce 
themselves and then say, "Now let's learn some plays." What's wrong with this 
picture? How can you execute a play effectively if you skip the fundamentals? 
Trust me, this type of coaching goes on everyday. <P>

Ok, this is for you doubting Thomas's of the world who are only interested in 
the win. You want to win more games? Follow this line of thought. My team 
played one of the best teams in St. Louis yeaterday in my tournament. We have 
played this team at least 10 times before, and never gotten within 7 points 
of them. They are really, really good.  This team played a flex offense. 
Defensively they played m-2-m and also a 1-1-2-1 trapping zone defense. So 
much for their gameplan. <P>

We played 100% m-2-m defense and no set offense. They never could figure out 
our offense, because there was no pattern and we scored because of good ole 
fashioned basketball sense. My team fought through their screens and stayed 
with their girl on our m-2-m defense and we won by two. This was the first 
time we had ever beaten them. You want the almighty win? How can a team stop 
you if they can't figure out what you're doing? <P>

Is this type of play for everyone? Nope, nope, nope! It's not even for most 
teams. But if you teach your kids enough, it can be for you.<P> 

Let's hit one more subject. I've spent an aweful lot of time on priorities, 
coaching style, and having fun. Why do you think that is? Am I into the save 
a whale, save a tree, or save a kid crusade? I don't think so. <P>

Being successful at whatever you do is comprised of only two parts, learning 
how to do something, and doing it with the right attitude. Attitudes win 
games. If the best player in the world has their head up their patooty, they 
will have a bad game. If an average player has his head on right, he will 
play better than average that day. Scream at a younger kid and watch what 
type of attitude you get. Next, watch how they play, because they will suck. 
Encourage a kid, praise them when they do something right, and they keep on 
TRYING to to it right. Bad attitudes = a bad game ! Kids are rebellious at 
this age anyway, don't add to it. <P>

I have given you all you need to know for year one. You have some basic 
drills that will help you teach your kids the game. I have tried to brainwash 
you into having what I consider to be the right priorities. I could go into 
oodles more, but you have more than enough on your plate at this time. 
Remember this is your and your players first year. SIMPLE IS GOOD! <P>

There's only one more chapter and this will be a fun one. I asked a bunch of 
my buddies at Chalk Talk to give me a basketball cliche or saying. I have 
compiled a list of them for you. These will be quotes you can use and impress 
the wee-wads out of other coaches and parents with. There will also be a lot 
you can learn from these quotes. I know, because I learned a bunch from them. 
Remember, COACH = TEACHER AND ROLE MODEL !!!! <P>

Have any questions or need any help, e-mail me at firepow55@aol.com  In case 
any of you are interested, my e-mail address comes from my team's name, Team 
Firepower. Someone else had firepower so I could only use firepow. The  55 
comes from the old speed limit of 55 mph. Why 55, because it's a constant 
reminder to myself not to speed with my team. When you speed, you skip steps! <P>

<h2>CHAPTER 35 - How to Impress Your Fellow Coaches - or, I can talk the talk!</h2> <P>
Behind every cliche, platitude, or country saying, there is a kernel of truth or more. Here is a collection of sayings from my buddies at Chalk Talk. Most of these sayings have more than a kernel of truth. These are also sayings you can use at basketball frat or sorority parties. You can use these on Super Coach! Or, as my buddies have done, you can use them to help teach your kids. Some of these need no explanation. When I need to jump in and explain one, I will, but it will be rare. Here's the format: author, then the saying. Most of the authors use e-mail names, so sorry if I don't have real names for some of them.<P>

Sbay Coach: If the clock is running, then why are you standing still?<P>

Alaska Coach: Learn to do the simple things perfectly<P>

Coach MacKinney: Practice makes habit. Perfect practice makes perfect!<P>

Alaska Coach: Nobody ever drowned in sweat! (God, I love this one!)<P>

Sbay Coach: Don't spectate, participate<P>

Coach Mark Bonifield: Defensive position is like the new Dodge, wider is better!<P>

Coach MacKinney: If you want to get open, set a good screen (to get your teammate open)<P>

Coach MacKinney: Win the old fashioned way - outwork your opponent<P>

Andrew Haysom: No stance - no chance!  (on offense, if your shooting form is wrong, odds of you making a shot are slim. On defense, if your footwork and positioning is off, you are easy to score against!)<P>

Sbay Coach with a Ricky Birdsong quote: There is no glory in rebounding, JUST VICTORY<P>

coach mph: Scoring a lot of points may impress your girlfriend or boyfriend, but defense wins games, and rebounding wins championships! <P>

Sbay Coach: To win, you must defend!<P>

Alaska Coach: Behold! The power of possession! (Offense isn't just the best defense, it's the perfect defense. Teach the kids the power of possession. The other team can not score, if you have the ball.)<P>

Sbay Coach: Maximum effort, all of the time!<P>

aussie coach: A winner finds reasons, a loser makes excuses! <P>

Coach Mark Bonifield: If you want to Be like Mike," take a hike! I will have no 360 double pump from behind the back board, tongue hanging out, windmill finger roll lay ups on my team. When you make the pros, go for it. BUT NOT IN THIS PROGRAM!<P>

aussie coach: a successful team is like an iceberg, everyone sees the star, but  underneath it all is that big, wide, strong base: the rest of the team. Without that base, the star sinks too.<P>

Sbay Coach with a Michael Jordan quote: Always focus on what you want to achieve<P>

Sbay Coach with a Bill Walton quote: Winning is about having the whole team on the same page.<P>

b-ball ed: COACH: TEACHER AND ROLE MODEL!!!!<P>

b-ball ed: Simple is good!!!!!!<P>

Sbay Coach: when you get to the end of your rope...tie a knot and hold on!!!<P>

Country Coach: There will come a time when winter will ask, "What have you done all summer?" (Basketball players are made in the summer!)<P>

Anon.: Basketball players are made in the summer, teams are made in the winter!<P>

Anon: Your players won't remember the score of a game 20 years from now. But they will remember if they sat the bench rather than played. And, they will remember how you treated them!<P>

b-ball ed: You are always teaching your players something. When you scream at them, what are you teaching them? Before every practice or game, you need to decide, "WHAT WILL YOU TEACH YOUR KIDS TODAY, AND HOW WILL YOU TEACH IT?"<P>

You want to know what to teach your players? Every one of these sayings could make an extremely valid LS. There is a lesson to be taught in all of them. I thought this would be the last chapter, but after all of the e-mails I have received, there will be one more question - answer session. This will be a meat and potatoes session.<P>

I have debated about doing something for the 2nd and 3rd year coaches. If this appeals to you, let me know at firepow55@aol.com <P>

PS, please let the site that you found this on know that you do appreciate them posting this for you. If I can believe my e-mails, there are at least a 1,000 beginning coaches using this as a guide. Without Coach Jackson, Alaska Coach, Chalk Talk, and Power Basketball, these coaches would never have found this book. Just drop them a line and say thanks.<P>



<h2>Chapter 36 = YOU ARE ONLY VERTICAL FOR SO LONG, THEN ..........</h2> <P>

I have always had this attitude that you are only vertical for so long, then
you are horizontal forever. Just like life, all good things must come to an
end.  So it should come as no surprise that this is the last chapter in the
book. I am going to give you a Readers Digest version of some of the e-mails
I have received, asking specific questions. Then, I will give you my most
"unworthy opinion" on how to fix the leaking facets. The first one proves
that I can be a real jerk sometimes. Once you've read it all, I hope you
understand why!<P>

Q:  I have a 5th grade girls team that does the basics pretty well. We have
won all of our games by over 30 points, but I want to find a new offense that
will let me win by even more. Defensively we play a 1-3-1 zone and with my
teams heigth, it's really hard to score against us. The area we need to
improve on is our offense. We play a flex and a wheel offense. I would
appreciate any ideas for new plays so we can win by an even greater margin?<P>

A:  This book is for beginning coaches who teach the fundamentals. Secondly,
to play a 1-3-1 zone, at the 5th grade level, is only ok if your team is
extemely solid in a m-2-m defense.  I doubt that they could even spell m-2-m,
let alone be proficient at it. To ask me this, makes me seriously doubt if
you have even read my book. You are one of these coaches that I preach
against. To ask how to beat other 5th grade teams by 50 points, means you
shouldn't be allowed the priviledge of coaching kids. Once you are up by 20
points or so, basketball courtesy says you don't run up the score. This is
especially true for the younger kids. AND 5TH GRADERS ARE YOUNGER KIDS !!<P>

To you, the readers of this book, I hope you understand my anger with jerks
like this.
I guarantee you that his kids know his zone defense and zero m-2-m. By 7th
grade the other teams will catch up to his team, and then start beating them
soundly, as long as they have coaches that teach. This guy is coaching for
his own ego, and not for the benifit of his players.<P>

Q:  While I support your beliefs about teaching the fundamentals and m-2-m
defense, my team is being beat by the 2-1-2 zones that the other teams play.
Do you have any ideas that could help us win at least one game?<P>

A:  Please re-read chapter 31, that's the one about Zone Busters. At this
level there are only 3 things that I can think of to solve this problem.<P>

1.   Shoot over the zone. Get your best long range shooters to square their
shoulders to the basket, and start shooting. One thing to remember about
this. LONG DISTANCE SHOOTS USUALLY MEAN LONG DISTNCE REBOUNDS. If your
players try to stay within 2 feet of the basket, THEY WILL WATCH the rebounds
soar over their heads. Long distaqnce shots mean long distance rebounds.<P>

2.   Pass the ball around the zone quicker than their players can react and
cover the ball. Someon will end up open for a shot.<P>

3.   Overload their zone. This is explained in chapt. 31.<P>

Q:  The referees aren't calling enough fouls and someone is bound to get
hurt. Should I point this out to them or what should I do?<P>

A:   I've never seen jumping a ref work. If you want to pull them aside at
the half and ask them to watch a specific player because of their swinging
elbows, that might work. Basketball is a hard physical sport. Remember, NO
WEAK SISTERS ALLOWED! Now let's add to this puzzle. Most referees for youth
leagues lack a solid knowledge of the rules and the game. Most receive $6-$8
per game. You get what you pay for. Thes folks usually take every comment you
make personally and negatively. This puts your team on their bad side.
Unfortunately my advice is - Grin and bear it! Watch the college coaches.
They don't believe you can get quality refs, even at the college level.<P>

Q:   My 4th grade players have a hard enough time getting the ball to the
basket with 2 hands. I understand that I should be teaching the proper
techniques, but what do I do when they aren't strong enough to do it one
handed?<P>

A:   Getting it to the basket one handed is a matter of learning and the
right mental attitude. Start them shooting one handed about 3 feet away from
the basket. As they get comfortable at this distance, slowly go to 4 feet,
then 5', and so on. Next, in 7th grade, I had a 5'6" girl who weighed 150
pounds and couldn't shoot a freethrow and get the ball there, unless she did
it 2 handed. At the same time, my best 3 point shooter was 4'10" tall. My
short player thought she could, so she could. My bigger player didn't believe
she could, and she was right! Kids will find a way to get something done,
when they want to. <P>

Q:   I coach 5th grade boys. I have read your book and it is working great on
defense, but I need some help on offense. We are getting open shots but they
just won't go in. We played a team last night that we should have beaten. We
outshot them by two to one, but ours just wouldn't go in. Help!<P>

A:   First look at their shooting form. If this is ok, then just get them to
shoot more in your LS's, and on their own. You might start every LS with what
I call the 30-30-30-30. This is 30 shots, from 6 feet out, 30 from the right,
30 from the middle, 30 from the left sides, and then 30 freethrows. Depending
upon how many baskets your gym has, this normally takes about 10 minutes.
Then at the end of your LS, give them homework. They are to shoot 300 shots
on their own at home. You will see your shooting %'s increase dramatically.
Now if your shooting form isn't ok, then spend alot more time in your LS's on
the proper form.<P>

Q:   I am having problems with my defense. I did as you suggested and we are
playing strictly m-2-m defense. Our 1st game we lost by 30. The next game was
by 18. The next was 12 and our last game we lost by 6. Everyone keeps telling
me to go to a zone. What do you think?<P>

A:   Your losses are by a slimmer margin every time. It would appear that
your kids are getting better at m-2-m. I wouldn't switch to a zone when your
team is showing major improvement. It sounds like you need to work on your
offense more, not your defense. Next time you scrimmage or play a game, watch
your kids shooting form, watch their screens, are they rebounding the missed
shots and putting them back up and in, and the shot selection. If they are
making 25% or more of their shots, then look at your defense. If you are only
making 10-20% of your shots, then it's not your defense.<P>

Q:   I am coaching my son's 1st grade team. Any ideas would be appreciated.<P>

A:   I am not a big believer in 1st or 2nd grade teams. I haven't ever
coached that young a team, so I may be speaking out of ignorance. My best
guess is to concentrate more on passing and dribbling contests. Make sure
everything you do is fun. At this age the kids are just looking to have fun.
If you can make learning fun, you will have succeeded big time!<P>

Q:   I coach a 4th grade girls team. Our next opponent has a guard that
scores about 20 points a game. Any ideas?<P>

A:   A guard that scores 20 points at the 4th grade level probably makes a
lot of their points from layups. Also, they probably score almost all of
their teams points. 4th grade scores are normally 15 to 10, 20 - 8, etc. Two
ideas come to mind. When your team has the ball, always make sure that you
leave a guard around the top of the key. Your guard is there to keep the
other team from making a fast break every time they get the ball. Next,
figure out who the other teams weakest player is, and don't guard them.
Double team the 20 point player, and make their weakest player beat you.<P>

Q:   In our league, I don't have a choice who is on my team, and I can't kick
anyone off of the team. I have a boy who has the worst attitude. He verbally
picks on the other players and keeps everyone upset. The other players are
good kids, but I'm losing them because of my trouble maker. Help!<P>

A:   Every team will have at least one player that is a source of cancer. Me
personally, I would give him a warning, verbal and written, in front of his
parents. If it occurred again, adios amigo. You can't do that, so here is an
alternative. Give the verbal/written warning in front of his parents. The
next offense will be dealt with in practice with suicides. Every offense
there after will result in reduced playing time. Finally you will get to a
point where there is no playing time. Make the kid quit. Everything you do
will need to be in writing and given to the parents. Also make copies and
send to  your league co-ordinator and bring a copy to each game where you
plan on benching this player. This way you are justified in what you are
doing and it shouldn't be able to backfire on you. ALWAYS COVER YOUR TUSH!!!<P>

Q:   I want to give a friend of mine a copy of oyur book, so could I have
your permission to do so?<P>

A:   As long as it is not for reprint in any media form, or for the intent of
making money. As long as it is for your personal use, or theirs, copy away my
friend. These websites and I are putting this 1st book on the web for free.
It was written with the sole purpose of trying to help that 1st year coach.
It was never intended to make anyone a profit.<P>

Q:  My 6th grade team just got beat 40-6. The other team put a full court
press on us the whole game and we couldn't get the ball across the half court
line. What can I do?<P>

A:   First let me say I don't believe in full court presses in rec. leagues.
I totally believe in full court presses for everything else. My team has full
court pressed every minute of every game since 6th grade. When we are up by
20, we stop pressing. But we are not a rec. team. That said, how do you beat
it? Unless you have one fantastic dribbler, you beat a press by passing. Here
are a few of the basic rules:<P>

1.   You try to keep the ball toward the middle of the court. Basketball is
just the opposite of soccer. In soccer, you take the ball down the sidelines
and pass into the middle, close to the goal. In basketball, it's just the
opposite. You bring the ball down the middle of the court, and dish off to
the wings, close to the basket. If you bring it down the sidelines, it's too
easy for the other team to trap you against the sideline.<P>

2.   Unless you are making a long pass over the opposing player, try to make
all of your passes bounce passes, they are harder to steal.<P>

3.   Take fewer dribbles and pass it down the court.<P>

Whenever my team has a problem bringing it down the court, I make them play
like it's a  no dribble scrimmage. Even though we are in the middle of a
game, I will not allow them to dribble the ball. This forces everyone to move
to get open. We have never had a problem bringing it down the court this way.<P>
