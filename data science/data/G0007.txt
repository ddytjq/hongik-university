<dt><font color="#ffff00">Abell catalog</font></dt>
  <dd>A catalog of 2712 <font color="#ccffcc">rich clusters of galaxies</font> produced by 
  George Abell in 1958 from careful examination of the Palomar Sky Survey plates.  It was 
  extended in 1989 by George Abell, Harold Corwin and Ron Olowin to include an extra 1364 
  rich clusters in the far southern hemisphere not covered by the original Palomar Sky Survey.  
  It contains most of the richest clusters of galaxies within 3 billion 
  <font color="#ccffcc">light years</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Abell cluster</font></dt>
  <dd>See <font color="#ccffcc">Rich cluster of galaxies</font>,
  <font color="#ccffcc">Abell catalog</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Absolute magnitude</font></dt>
  <dd>The <font color="#ccffcc">apparent magnitude</font> an object would have if placed at
  a distance of exactly 10 <font color="#ccffcc">parsecs</font> (=32.6 
  <font color="#ccffcc">light years</font>).  A <font color="#ccffcc">supergiant star</font> 
  might have an absolute magnitude of -8 whereas a dim <font color="#ccffcc">red dwarf</font> 
  might have an absolute magnitude of +16.  The Sun has an absolute magnitude of +4.8 - 
  about half way between the two extremes.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Angular Size</font></dt>
  <dd>The apparent size of an object expressed as an angle.  It is measured in degrees,
  minutes and seconds.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Apparent magnitude</font></dt>
  <dd>The system used to give the brightness of stars in the sky.  Brighter stars have
  lower numbers and dimmer stars have higher numbers.  The dimmest objects visible with
  giant telescopes have a magnitude of +30.  A good portable telescope might see down to
  magnitude +15.  Binoculars can see down to magnitude +9 and the faintest naked eye stars
  have a magnitude of +6.  Very bright objects have a negative magnitude, the brightest star
  has a magnitude of -1.4, the full Moon has a magnitude of -12.7 and the noon Sun has a 
  magnitude of -26.8.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Arcminute</font></dt>
  <dd>A measure for small angles.  1 arcminute = 1/60 degree.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Arcsecond</font></dt>
  <dd>A measure for very small angles. 1 arcsecond = 1/60 arcminute = 1/3600 degree.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Association</font></dt>
  <dd>See <font color="#ccffcc">OB association</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Astronomical Unit</font></dt>
  <dd>The average distance between the Earth and the Sun.  It is equal to 149&nbsp;597&nbsp;871 km.
  It is often used for distances in a solar system or for distances between companion 
  stars.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Barnard catalog</font></dt>
  <dd>A catalog of 349 dark nebulae north of declination -35∞ produced by E Barnard in 1927.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Barred Galaxy</font></dt>
  <dd>A <font color="#ccffcc">galaxy</font> with a bright central bar of stars.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Bayer name</font></dt>
  <dd>The combination of a Greek letter and the name of a <font color="#ccffcc">constellation</font>
  (Alpha Centauri, Epsilon Orionis etc.) used to identify bright stars.  The system was 
  first used by Johann Bayer in 1603.  Brighter stars in a <font color="#ccffcc">constellation</font> 
  usually have a letter near the beginning of the alphabet, and dimmer stars usually have 
  a letter nearer the end of the alphabet.  A few faint stars were given lower-case Roman 
  letters from a to z or upper-case Roman letters from A to Q (p Eridani, N Velorum etc.)  
  See also <font color="#ccffcc">Flamsteed number</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Black hole</font></dt>
  <dd>The ultimate cosmic plughole formed when a high mass <font color="#ccffcc">supergiant star</font>
  explodes in a <font color="#ccffcc">supernova</font> explosion at the end of its life 
  creating a super-dense point in space where nothing can escape the gravitational pull.  
  A star probably has to have a mass of more that 40 solar masses to create a black hole 
  which typically have a mass of about 3 solar masses.  Black holes can be detected by the 
  disrupting effects they have on neighbouring stars.  The centres of most galaxies 
  including our own are believed to have super-massive black holes which have sucked in 
  thousands of stars.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Bonner Durchmusterung catalog</font></dt>
  <dd>A star catalog of 325&nbsp;037 northern stars produced between 1859 and 1862 with a supplement of
  134&nbsp;833 southern stars produced in 1886.  Later came two more large southern star catalogs: the
  Cordoba Durchmusterung (613&nbsp;959 stars) produced between 1892 and 1932, and the Cape Photographic
  Durchmusterung (454&nbsp;877 stars) produced between 1895 and 1900.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Bright Star catalog</font></dt>
  <dd>A star catalog of nearly all the stars brighter than <font color="#ccffcc">magnitude</font>
  +6.5 published by the Yale University Observatory.  The original version was published 
  in 1908 as the Harvard Revised Photometry Catalog.  The current version is the fifth 
  edition and contains 9096 stars.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Brown dwarf star</font></dt>
  <dd>A failed star that was too small at its birth for nuclear reactions to occur in its 
  core.  They may be very common, but because they only glow very dimly they are very hard
  to detect.  Brown dwarfs are <u>not</u> brown, they begin their lives by glowing a dull 
  red and then fade.  Brown dwarfs are more massive than planets, and range in mass from 10 to 
  80 times the mass of Jupiter (or 0.01 to 0.08 times the mass of the Sun).  There are two 
  main types of brown dwarfs   - the hotter ones (1500K to 2500K) are type L; the cooler 
  ones (200K to 1500K) are type T.  The hottest brown dwarfs are sometimes classified as 
  very cool type M <font color="#ccffcc">red dwarf stars</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Cluster of galaxies</font></dt>
  <dd>A concentration of <font color="#ccffcc">galaxies</font> bound together by gravity.  
  The term 'cluster' usually refers to a large collection of many tens or hundreds of 
  <font color="#ccffcc">galaxies</font> and the term 'group' is used for a much smaller 
  grouping.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Constellation</font></dt>
  <dd>Random patterns of stars in the night sky produced by the chance alignment of stars of 
  different luminosities and distances.  There are 88 constellations - 48 were listed by
  the ancient Greeks, and another 40 were added after 1600.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Dark matter</font></dt>
  <dd>The visible stars and nebulae make up only a small fraction of all the matter in 
  the universe.  The rest is in a form that is not easy to detect, but clearly exists 
  because of the effect it has on the motion of stars in <font color="#ccffcc">galaxies</font>
  and the motion of <font color="#ccffcc">galaxies</font> in <font color="#ccffcc">clusters</font>.
  Dark matter probably consists of various types of subatomic particles.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Declination</font></dt>
  <dd>See <font color="#ccffcc">Equatorial coordinates</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Dwarf galaxy</font></dt>
  <dd>A small <font color="#ccffcc">galaxy</font> usually containing any number of stars 
  between a million and several billion.  There is no official size below which a 
  <font color="#ccffcc">galaxy</font> is designated a dwarf but any 
  <font color="#ccffcc">galaxy</font> with a diameter below 40000 <font color="#ccffcc">light years</font>
  can be considered a dwarf.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Dwarf star</font></dt>
  <dd>A normal <font color="#ccffcc">main sequence star</font> like the Sun that is 
  burning hydrogen in nuclear reactions in its core.  The brightest dwarf stars can be 
  much larger than the Sun.  See also <font color="#ccffcc">Giant star</font>, 
  <font color="#ccffcc">Supergiant star</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Elliptical galaxy</font></dt>
  <dd>A <font color="#ccffcc">galaxy</font> with a smooth circular or oval shape. 
  They are classified as type E and range in shape from type E0 - circular, to
  type E7 - highly elliptical.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Equatorial coordinates</font></dt>
  <dd>The most common coordinate system used by astronomers.  It is the equivalent of the 
  Earth's latitude and longitude projected onto the sky except that longitude is called 
  Right Ascension and latitude is called Declination.  For historical reasons, Right 
  Ascension is not measured in degrees but in 'hours' - 24 hours being equivalent to 
  360 degrees.  Another complication is that this coordinate system is very slowly 
  moving with time - star positions for 1950 are slightly different to those for the 
  year 2000 for example.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Flamsteed number</font></dt>
  <dd>The combination of a number and the name of a <font color="#ccffcc">constellation</font>
  (61 Cygni, 36 Ophiuchi etc.) used to identify naked-eye stars.  The numbers were 
  applied to John Flamsteed's star catalog published in 1725.  Not all naked-eye stars 
  have a Flamsteed number and most stars in the far southern hemisphere do not have one.
  See also <font color="#ccffcc">Bayer name</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Galactic coordinates</font></dt>
  <dd>A coordinate system based on the plane of the <font color="#ccffcc">Galaxy</font>, 
  it is centred on the Sun with the zero point of longitude and latitude pointing 
  directly at the galactic centre.  The symbols used for galactic coordinates are 
  l (longitude) and b (latitude).  The zero point of Galactic latitude and longitude is
  at RA=17h45m37s Dec=-28∞56'10&quot;, and the Galactic north pole is at RA=12h51m26s 
  Dec=+27∞07'42&quot;, (epoch 2000 coordinates).</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Galactocentric coordinates</font></dt>
  <dd>The same coordinate system as <font color="#ccffcc">galactic coordinates</font> 
  except that this system is centred on the centre of the <font color="#ccffcc">Galaxy</font>.
  The small uncertainty in the distance to the galactic centre prevents this system 
  from being widely used.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Galaxy</font></dt>
  <dd>A vast concentration of millions or billions of stars.  There are four main types
  of galaxies: <font color="#ccffcc">Elliptical Galaxies</font>, 
  <font color="#ccffcc">Lenticular galaxies</font>, <font color="#ccffcc">Spiral Galaxies</font> 
  and <font color="#ccffcc">Irregular galaxies</font>.  Our galaxy contains 200 billion 
  stars, but the largest galaxies contain many trillions.  See also 
  <font color="#ccffcc">Dwarf Galaxy</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Giant star</font></dt>
  <dd>A star the size of the Sun will end its life after several billion years by expanding
  greatly because of changing energy balances at the core of the star.  The surface
  temperature drops and the star becomes redder, this lasts several million years before
  the star throws off its outer layers and becomes a <font color="#ccffcc">white dwarf</font>.
  See also <font color="#ccffcc">Dwarf star</font>, <font color="#ccffcc">Supergiant star</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Giclas catalog</font></dt>
  <dd>The usual name given to the Lowell Proper Motion Survey catalog produced in the 1970's
  containing 11&nbsp;747 stars with a high <font color="#ccffcc">proper motion</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Gliese catalog</font></dt>
  <dd>The usual name given to three catalogs of nearby stars compiled by W Gliese (and 
  later by H Jahreiﬂ) in 1957, 1969 and 1993.  The third catalog which listed 3803 stars 
  within 25 <font color="#ccffcc">parsecs</font> was only released in a preliminary form, 
  and despite hints of a new 4th catalog, there are no signs of one appearing.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Globular star cluster</font></dt>
  <dd>A spherical cluster of many thousands of stars.  Globular clusters usually have a 
  size of 50 to 150 <font color="#ccffcc">light years</font> and are found scattered in a 
  spherical halo surrounding <font color="#ccffcc">galaxies</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Group of galaxies</font></dt>
  <dd>A concentration of <font color="#ccffcc">galaxies</font> bound together by gravity. 
  The term 'group' usually refers to a small collection of a few tens of 
  <font color="#ccffcc">galaxies</font> and the term 'cluster' is used for a much larger 
  grouping.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Harvard Revised catalog</font></dt>
  <dd>See <font color="#ccffcc">Bright Star catalog</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Henry-Draper catalog</font></dt>
  <dd>A catalog of the <font color="#ccffcc">spectral classes</font> of 272&nbsp;150 stars 
  produced between 1918 and 1924.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Hipparcos catalog</font></dt>
  <dd>A catalog of 118&nbsp;218 stars surveyed by the Hipparcos satellite launched in 1989.  It 
  collected the <font color="#ccffcc">parallaxes</font> of these stars providing accurate 
  distances to tens of thousands of stars within 1000 <font color="#ccffcc">light years</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Hubble constant</font></dt>
  <dd>The value which describes the rate at which the universe expands with time.  The 
  Hubble constant helps to determine the size and age of the universe, and is also used 
  to convert the <font color="#ccffcc">redshift</font> of a <font color="#ccffcc">galaxy</font>
  into a distance estimate.  The Hubble constant is not known precisely but it is 
  somewhere in the range of 55 to 80 km/s/Mpc.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">IC catalog</font></dt>
  <dd>The Index Catalog.  A supplement to the <font color="#ccffcc">NGC catalog</font> 
  listing an extra 5386 <font color="#ccffcc">star clusters</font>, <font color="#ccffcc">nebulae</font>
  and <font color="#ccffcc">galaxies</font>.  It is actually a combination of two catalogs,
  the first published in 1895 and the second in 1908.  See also 
  <font color="#ccffcc">NGC catalog</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Irregular galaxy</font></dt>
  <dd>A <font color="#ccffcc">galaxy</font> with a very irregular shape and no
  obvious elliptical or spiral structure.  They are classfied as type Irr.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Large Galaxy</font></dt>
  <dd>See <font color="#ccffcc">Galaxy</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Lenticular galaxy</font></dt>
  <dd>A <font color="#ccffcc">galaxy</font> that is shaped like a lens.  They are of
  an intermediate type between an <font color="#ccffcc">elliptical galaxy</font> and 
  a <font color="#ccffcc">spiral galaxy</font>.  They are classified as type S0.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Light year</font></dt>
  <dd>The distance light travels in a year.  It is equal to 0.3066 <font color="#ccffcc">parsecs</font>.  
  It is 9461 billion km or 63&nbsp;240 <font color="#ccffcc">astronomical units</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Luyten, Willem</font></dt>
  <dd>An astronomer who from the 1930's to the 1980's found thousands of nearby stars in
  several huge surveys including the Bruce Proper Motion Survey in 1944 and the 
  Luyten-Palomar survey conducted in the 1970's.  He produced many 
  <font color="#ccffcc">proper motion</font> catalogs including the Luyten catalog (L), 
  the Luyten-Palomar catalog (LP), the Luyten Two-Tenths Arcsecond catalog (LTT), the 
  Luyten Four-Tenths Arcsecond catalog (LFT), and the Luyten Half-Second catalog (LHS).</dd>

  <dd>See <font color="#ccffcc">Apparent magnitude</font>, 
  <font color="#ccffcc">Absolute magnitude</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Main sequence star</font></dt>
  <dd>A normal star like the Sun that is burning hydrogen in nuclear reactions to 
  produce its energy.  Other types of stars include: <font color="#ccffcc">giant stars</font>,
  <font color="#ccffcc">supergiant stars</font> and <font color="#ccffcc">white dwarfs</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Minute</font></dt>
  <dd>See <font color="#ccffcc">Arcminute</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Nebula</font></dt>             
  <dd>A cloud of interstellar gas and dust.  Bright nebulae glow with light emitted by the
  gas of which they are composed (emission nebulae) or by reflected starlight (reflection
  nebulae) or both. Dark nebulae consist of clouds of gas and dust that are not 
  illuminated.  <font color="#ccffcc">Planetary nebulae</font> are shells of gas ejected 
  by stars.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Neutron star</font></dt>
  <dd>The core of a <font color="#ccffcc">supergiant star</font> which has collapsed during
  a <font color="#ccffcc">supernova</font> explosion so much that it consists entirely of
  neutrons.  Most stars between 8 and 60 solar masses end their lives like this usually 
  producing a neutron star with a mass of about 1.4 solar masses.  Neutron stars are only 
  10 kilometres across and have an incredible density - a teaspoon of neutron star 
  material would have a mass of hundreds of millions of tonnes.  See also 
  <font color="#ccffcc">Black hole</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">NGC catalog</font></dt>
  <dd>The New General Catalog.  A catalog of 7840 of the brightest 
  <font color="#ccffcc">star clusters</font>, <font color="#ccffcc">nebulae</font> 
  and <font color="#ccffcc">galaxies</font> published by J Dreyer in 1888.  See also 
  <font color="#ccffcc">IC catalog</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">OB association</font></dt>
  <dd>A loose group of tens or hundreds of very bright stars scattered over several 
  hundred <font color="#ccffcc">light years</font> of space.  The stars in an OB 
  association were formed in the same star-forming region and are slowly moving apart.  
  They are usually found in the spiral arms of <font color="#ccffcc">galaxies</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Open star cluster</font></dt>
  <dd>A cluster of stars usually containing several hundred members packed into a region 
  usually less than 20 <font color="#ccffcc">light years</font> in size.  They are normally 
  found near regions of star formation in the spiral arms of <font color="#ccffcc">galaxies</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Orange dwarf star</font></dt>
  <dd>Stars with a luminosity inbetween the Sun-like <font color="#ccffcc">yellow</font> stars 
  and <font color="#ccffcc">red dwarfs</font>.  They are classified as type K stars.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Parallax</font></dt>
  <dd>The tiny periodic shift of the apparent positions of nearby stars due to the changing
  position of the Earth as it orbits the Sun.  The nearer the star is, the larger the
  shift.  The distance to stars in <font color="#ccffcc">parsecs</font> is simply 1/parallax, 
  (or in <font color="#ccffcc">light years</font> it is 3.2616/parallax) where the 
  parallax is in <font color="#ccffcc">arcseconds</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Parsec</font></dt>
  <dd>The distance a star has to be to have a <font color="#ccffcc">parallax</font> shift 
  of 1 <font color="#ccffcc">arcsecond</font>.  (No star is actually this close).  
  1 parsec = 3.2616 <font color="#ccffcc">light years</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Planetary nebula</font></dt>
  <dd>An expanding envelope of gas surrounding a hot <font color="#ccffcc">white dwarf</font>.
  It is formed at the end of a <font color="#ccffcc">giant star's</font> life when the 
  core contracts ejecting the outer atmosphere of the star creating both the 
  <font color="#ccffcc">white dwarf</font> and the <font color="#ccffcc">nebula</font>.  
  The intense radiation from the central <font color="#ccffcc">white dwarf</font> makes 
  the <font color="#ccffcc">nebula</font> glow.  Planetary nebulae disperse within 50&nbsp;000 
  years.  They are called planetary nebulae because to early astronomers they looked a 
  bit like planets.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Proper Motion</font></dt>
  <dd>The slow steady shift of the apparent positions of nearby stars over many years 
  because of their independent motion within the <font color="#ccffcc">Galaxy</font>.  
  Even the nearest and fastest stars require centuries to move a degree or more.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Quasar</font></dt>
  <dd>A <font color="#ccffcc">galaxy</font> with an extremely luminous nucleus outshining 
  the parent <font color="#ccffcc">galaxy</font> by several hundred times.  They lie 
  billions of <font color="#ccffcc">light years</font> away and were a feature of the 
  early universe.  The energy source of a quasar is probably matter falling into a 
  supermassive <font color="#ccffcc">black hole</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Radial Velocity</font></dt>
  <dd>The speed of an object in the direction towards or away from the observer.  In an
  expanding universe a <font color="#ccffcc">galaxy</font> with a larger radial velocity 
  generally lies further from the observer than one with a smaller radial velocity.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Red dwarf star</font></dt>
  <dd>The smallest and dimmest stars.  About 80% of all stars are red dwarfs although none are
  visible from Earth with the naked eye.  Because they shine with less than 1% of the Sun's
  output they live a long time - the smallest are likely to last thousands of billions of
  years.  They are classified as type M stars.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Redshift</font></dt>
  <dd>An increase in the wavelength of light caused by the movement of the source of the
  light in a direction away from the observer.  Faster speeds produce a larger redshift
  and thus provide a measure of the <font color="#ccffcc">radial velocity</font> of the 
  source.  In an expanding universe <font color="#ccffcc">galaxies</font> with large 
  redshifts lie at greater distances than <font color="#ccffcc">galaxies</font> with 
  small redshifts.  Redshifts can also be produce by light climbing out of a strong 
  gravitational field such as a <font color="#ccffcc">black hole</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Rich cluster of galaxies</font></dt>
  <dd>A <font color="#ccffcc">cluster of galaxies</font> containing hundreds of large 
  <font color="#ccffcc">galaxies</font>.  The nearest rich cluster is the Virgo cluster. 
  The richest clusters can contain thousands of large <font color="#ccffcc">galaxies</font>.
  Most of the richest clusters in the nearby universe are listed in the

  <dd>A star together with the planets, moons, asteroids, comets and dust which orbit
  it.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Spectral Classification</font></dt>
  <dd>The system used to classify stars.  Stars fall into seven main catagories:
  O, B, A, F, G, K and M ranging from hot blue-white stars to cooler red stars.  A number
  (0 to 9) is usually added to denote a sub-class.  A roman numeral is sometimes added to
  denote the size of the star.  <font color="#ccffcc">Supergiant stars</font> are class I, 
  <font color="#ccffcc">Giant stars</font> are class III, and ordinary 
  <font color="#ccffcc">main sequence</font> stars are class V.  (Types II and IV are 
  inbetween types).  The Sun is type G2V, whereas Arcturus - an orange 
  <font color="#ccffcc">giant star</font> - is type K2III.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Spiral galaxy</font></dt>
  <dd>A <font color="#ccffcc">galaxy</font> with spiral arms.  There are two main
  types, those with central bar - SB, and those without - S (or SA).  Spiral galaxies are
  also subdivided into types a, b, c (and sometimes d), depending on how tightly wound the 
  spiral arms are.</dd>

  surrounding large voids in which very few <font color="#ccffcc">galaxies</font> exist.  
  Superclusters formed in the early universe when matter clumped together under the 
  influence of gravity.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Supergalactic coordinates</font></dt>
  <dd>A coordinate system based on the approximate plane of the Virgo 
  <font color="#ccffcc">Supercluster</font>.  The supergalactic plane passes through the 
  Sun and the middle of the Virgo cluster.  Several nearby <font color="#ccffcc">superclusters</font> 
  also lie close to this plane.  The symbols used for supergalactic coordinates are 
  L (longitude) and B (latitude).  The zero point of Supergalactic latitude and longitude
  is at RA=02h49m14s Dec=+59∞31'42&quot;, and the Supergalactic north pole is at RA=18h55m01s 
  Dec=+15∞42'32&quot;, (epoch 2000 coordinates).</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Supergiant star</font></dt>
  <dd>A star bigger than about 10 solar masses will become a supergiant star at the end of its
  life as hydrogen burning ceases causing the stars outer layers to expand.  Supergiant stars
  are the largest and brightest of all stars and they usually end up exploding in a
  <font color="#ccffcc">supernova</font> explosion and creating a 
  <font color="#ccffcc">neutron star</font> or a <font color="#ccffcc">black hole</font>.
  See also <font color="#ccffcc">Dwarf star</font>, <font color="#ccffcc">Giant star</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Supernova</font></dt>
  <dd>A catastrophic stellar explosion that can briefly outshine an entire 
  <font color="#ccffcc">galaxy</font> of billions of stars.  It can occur when a 
  <font color="#ccffcc">supergiant star</font> exhausts all its nuclear fuel causing 
  the core of the star to collapse releasing a vast amount of energy which blasts away 
  the outer parts of the star and leaves behind a <font color="#ccffcc">neutron star</font> 
  or in extreme cases a <font color="#ccffcc">black hole</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Supernova remnant</font></dt>
  <dd>The remains of a star visible as an expanding <font color="#ccffcc">nebula</font> 
  of gas that have been ejected at high speed by a <font color="#ccffcc">supernova</font> 
  explosion.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Temperature</font></dt>
  <dd>In astronomy temperature is measured with the Kelvin scale (symbol K) which is equal
  to ∞C + 273∞.  Thus a midday Earth temperature of 20∞C is equal to 293K and the Sun's 
  surface temperature of 5500∞C is about 5770K.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Variable star</font></dt>
  <dd>A star that varies in brightness.  There are many types, some stars can change in brightness
  in a matter of minutes whereas others change slowly over many months.  The first 334 variable
  stars discovered in a constellation are given a one or two letter code such as R Scuti or
  UV Ceti.  Other variable stars are designated V335, V336, etc.  Proxima Centauri for
  example is known to variable star astronomers as V645 Centauri.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Visual magnitude</font></dt>
  <dd>See <font color="#ccffcc">Apparent magnitude</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">White dwarf star</font></dt>
  <dd>The dying remnant of a <font color="#ccffcc">giant star</font> that has blown 
  away its outer layers to reveal an intensely hot core.  Only the youngest white dwarfs
  are actually white, over billions of years they slowly cool and change colour to yellow
  or orange (although the coolest white dwarfs are bluer than expected because the compressed 
  atmosphere of hydrogen filters out the red light).  They eventually become a dead black
  dwarf, although because the universe is less than 15 billion years old none have yet 
  cooled this much.  They are classified as type D stars.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Wolf, Max</font></dt>
  <dd>An astronomer who searched for high <font color="#ccffcc">proper motion</font> 
  stars between 1919 and 1931, producing a list of 1566 nearby stars.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Yale catalog</font></dt>
  <dd>See <font color="#ccffcc">Bright Star catalog</font>.</dd>
<dt><font color="#ffff00">Yellow dwarf star</font></dt>
  <dd>Any small yellow star like the Sun.  They are classified as type G stars.</dd>
