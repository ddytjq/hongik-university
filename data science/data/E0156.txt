strftime-Format a time string

Synopsis

        #include &#060;time.h&#062;

        ret = strftime(s, maxsize, format, timeptr);

        size_t ret;                  /* number of characters in            */
                                  /*   formatted string             */
        char *s;                  /* string to place characters in  */
        size_t maxsize;           /* maximum string size            */
        const char *format;          /* format instructions for string */
        const struct tm *timeptr; /* broken-down time information   */

Description

        This function is similar to the <a href="sprintf().html"> sprintf </a> function but has its own
        formatting instructions for printing out time information.

        This function places characters into the array pointed to by the
        argument s in the format specified by the string pointed to by the
        argument format.  The format argument consists of zero or more
        conversion specifiers and ordinary characters.        All ordinary
        characters, including the terminating NULL character, are copied
        unchanged into the array, but the conversion specifiers are
        replaced by the appropriate characters. A conversion specifier
        consists of a percent (%) character followed by a character. The
        following list describes the characters with which each conversion
        specifier is replaced.

        Conversion
        Specifier   Replaced with . . .
        ----------  -------------------
           %a            the locale's abbreviated weekday name
           %A            the locale's full weekday name
           %b            the locale's abbreviated month name
           %B            the locale's full month name
           %c            the locale's appropriate date and time
representation
           %d            the day of the month as a decimal number (01-31)
           %H            the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (00-23)
           %I            the hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (00-12)
           %j            the day of the year as a decimal number (001-366)
           %m            the month as a decimal number (01-12)
           %M            the minute as a decimal number (00-59)
           %p            the locale's equivalent of the AM and PM
designations
                    associated with a 12-hour clock
           %S            the second as a decimal number (00-61)
           %U            the week number of the year (the first Sunday as the
                    first day of week 1) as a decimal number (00-53)
           %w            the weekday as a decimal number (0-6), where Sunday
is 0
           %W            the week number of the year (the first Monday as the
                    first day of week 1) as a decimal number (00-53)
           %x            the locale's appropriate date representation
           %X            the locale's appropriate time representation
           %y            the year without the century as a decimal number
(00-99)
           %Y            the year with the century as a decimal number
           %Z            the time zone name or abbreviation; no characters
                    indicates the time zone is not determinable
           %%            a percent sign.

        No more than maxsize characters are placed into the array.  The
        appropriate characters are determined by the LC_TIME category of
        the current locale and by the values contained in the structure
        pointed to by the argument timeptr.  If copying takes place
        between objects that overlap or if the conversion specifier is not
        one of those listed above, the behavior is undefined.


Returns

        This function returns the number of characters placed into the
        string pointed to by the argument s, not including the terminating
        NULL character.  Otherwise, the strftime function returns a 0, and
        the contents of the s argument are indeterminate.
