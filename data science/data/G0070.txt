<P>
20 Jul 2000 - Today's <A HREF="http://www.nature.com/nature/">Nature</A>
has an article reporting on "superluminal" propagation, but
it is just <A HREF="./anomalous-dispersion.html">anomalous dispersion</A>.
The media are fooled again!

9 May 2000 - <A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0005123">Hanany
<EM>et al.</EM></A> announce results of the August 98 flight of the MAXIMA
experiment which are generally in agreement with the BOOMERanG results below,
but without any tendency to favor a slightly closed Universe.
My <A HREF="./CMB-DT.html">CMB angular power spectrum graphs</A> have
been updated to include MAXIMA.
</P>

<P>
27 Apr 2000 - Today's <A HREF="http://www.nature.com/nature/">Nature</A>
has an article reporting the results from the 10 day long duration
balloon flight of the <A
HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9911461">BOOMERanG</A> project.
These measurements of very small CMB temperature fluctuations over 1%
of the sky with a beam size 40 times smaller than <A
HREF="http://space.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/cobe/cobe_home.html">COBE's</A>
7<SUP>o</SUP> beam confirm earlier <A
HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9906421">work</A> by a group at
Penn &amp; Princeton and data from BOOMERanG's test flight, but provide
3 to 4 times more accuracy.  Based on
this data, de Bernardis <EM>et al.</EM> (2000, Nature, 404, 955)
conclude that the Universe is <A HREF="./cosmo_03.htm#SC">flat</A>.
</P>

<P>
The angular size of the characteristics spots on the sky, about 1<SUP>o</SUP>,
shows that the Universe is flat, or that the total energy density is
equal to the critical density.  
This confirms a prediction of the
<A HREF="./cosmo_04.htm#INF">inflationary scenario</A>.
The amplitude of the characteristics spots,
about 69 microK, indicates the ratio of ordinary matter
(<A HREF="./glossary.html#baryon">baryonic</A> matter) to 
<A HREF="./glossary.html#DM">dark matter</A>.
Detailed studies of the harmonics or overtones of the fundamental oscillations
that lead to these spots will provide much more information about the
Universe.  Stay tuned.

the noisy spectrum of the extremely faint z=6.68 object.
Notice the very strong and wide Lyman alpha

21 Aug 99 - The <A

PSS 1537+1227,
found on the <A

<A HREF="./glossary.html#QSO">quasar</A> (BAL QSO)

</P>

<P>
But the most amazing part of this story is that the 
<A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com">NY Times</A> published
a spectrum in the 17 Aug 99 print edition - a clear violation of the 
<A HREF="./cosmo_02.htm#5WNOZ">
"5 W's but no Z" </A> rule that I think
must be taught in science journalism schools.
The graph at right is a plot of the <A HREF="./glossary.html#flux">flux</A>

wavelength of the light in <A HREF="./glossary.html#micron">nanometers</A>.
</P>
<P>
Since 
<A HREF="./fluxplot.html">spectroscopy</A> is the tool most used 
by astronomers today,
this article in the NY times was very significant.
Spectra tell astronomers what elements are in distant stars and
galaxies, how hot and dense these objects are, and how rapidly they are
moving towards us or away from us.

Super-Kamiokande experiment</A> released a
<A HREF="http://www.phys.hawaii.edu:80/~jgl/sk_release.html">press
release</A> tied to a presentation at the Neutrino'98 meeting, which
announced that Super-K had confirmed that muon 
<A HREF="./neutrinos.html">neutrinos</A> produced
in the Earth's atmosphere by cosmic rays were changing 
(<A HREF="http://www.phys.hawaii.edu/~jgl/neutrino_news.html">"oscillating"</A>)
into a different kind of neutrino during their passage through the
Earth.  It is an interesting commentary on science journalism that this
press release generated front page headlines, while an article in the
29 May 98 Science by Joel Primack (v 280, pp 1398-1400), 
which states exactly the same properties of neutrinos based on 
<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ex/9803007">preprints</A> available at 
<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov">xxx.lanl.gov</A>, did not.
</P>

<P>
The oscillation data do not determine the 
<A HREF="./neutrinos.html#mass">
masses of neutrinos</A>, but
rather the difference between the squared masses of two neutrino types.
The atmospheric muon data gives <EM>m<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>2</SUP> -
m<SUB>1</SUB><SUP>2</SUP> = 0.001 to 0.01 eV<SUP>2</SUP></EM>.
Since the sum of the three neutrino masses has to be 5 to 7 eV to be
cosmologically interesting, this result from Super-K is a mixed blessing
for Mixed Dark Matter models, since is shows that
<UL>
<LI>neutrinos have non-zero mass,
<LI>but the mass is probably too small.
</UL>
One way out of this difficulty is to introduce a fourth neutrino type,
a sterile neutrino.  But this abandons one of the best aspects as
neutrinos as dark matter: that the particles have actually been seen.

<A HREF="./glossary.html#Omega">Omega<SUB>M</SUB></A> - 0.863*lambda = 
-0.40 +/- 0.15(stat) +/- 0.81(sys)

A <A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9812133">more detailed write-up</A>

0.28<SUP>+0.09</SUP><SUB>-0.08</SUB>

The potential systematic
errors could be large, but this is good evidence for a non-zero lambda
(<A HREF="./glossary.html#CC">cosmological constant</A>).
[The High-z SN Team results (see 4 Mar 98 above) can be written as
Omega<SUB>M</SUB> - 0.823*lambda = -0.31 +/- 0.14 and
0.823*Omega<SUB>M</SUB> + lambda = 0.95 +/- 1.92 which are remarkably

This FIRB is <EM>very small</EM>: if you put an IR detector in your
<EM>refrigerator</EM>, and closed the door so the light went out, the detector
would still see 7 billion times more power than the far IR background.<BR>
Five papers:

Previously posted or published papers by

Fixsen <EM>et al.</EM> give 14 nW/m<SUP>2</SUP>/sr for the total
intensity longer than 125 microns.
These values are 1-2% of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
radiation (the 2.725&nbsp;K blackbody).
In the S<SUB>10</SUB> notation often used for sky brightness,

13 May 97 - <A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap970513.html">
GRB970508</A> has an associated optical transient source that shows
absorption lines with a redshift of z = 0.835.  From the absence of the
Lyman alpha forest it is likely that the object itself is at z < 2.1,
and it must have z > 0.835.  Somehow the
<A HREF="http://www.latimes.com">LA Times</A> 15 May 1997 story
converted these redshifts
into distances between 2 and 7 billion light years.  They must have been
using Hubble's original value for H<SUB>o</SUB>.

So we welcome a new class
of objects to the field of cosmology.  And we still don't know how to
radiate 10<SUP>51</SUP> ergs of gamma rays in a few seconds.  This
energy is all the energy the Sun will radiate in its entire 10 billion

<H3>Does the Universe Have an Axis? -</H3><H2> NO!</H2>
<P> 18 Apr 97 - <A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9704196">Nodland 
and Ralston</A> claim an intrinsic rotation rate for polarized light 
that varies with the cosine of the angle relative to a preferred axis.  
But <A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9704247">
Eisenstein and Bunn</A>
point out statistical flaws in Nodland and Ralston's work.
I have found that
using Eisenstein and Bunn's null hypothesis increases the probability of
producing Nodland and Ralston's result by pure chance by more than a
factor of 100(!) for the case where the axis is specified, and a factor of
60 when the axis is found from the data.  As a result, the probability
of getting the Nodland and Ralston work by chance is 30
percent, which means that their result is not statistically significant.
<A HREF="http://itp.ucsb.edu/~carroll/aniso.html">Carroll and Field</A>
have done similar calculations and also find that there is no detectable
intrinsic rotation.
<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9704285">Leahy</A> has made
detailed studies of sources where the polarization angle can be
predicted accurately, and finds that any rotation is at least 30 times
smaller than that predicted by Nodland and Ralston.
Even though the effect is clearly not present, Professor J. W. Moffat
and net-kooks <A HREF="./tomes.txt">Ray Tomes</A> 
and Archimedes Plutonium have each announced
that the anisotropic rotation supports their theories.

1969 - Conklin (1969, Nature, 222, 971) discovers the dipole anisotropy

before the first flight of the U-2 experiment, so it is clear that
