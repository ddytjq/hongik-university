        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">In determining the elemental
        composition for an unknown compound from an exact mass measurement&nbsp;
        it helps to know as much as possible about
        the molecule being studied.&nbsp; Even if the molecule is a true unknown
        it is never truly unknown. We can easily ask, &quot;Is it a
        protein?&quot;, &quot;Is it a small molecule?&quot;, &quot;If it is a
        small molecule what are the functional groups?&quot;&nbsp; Use UV, IR, NMR, chemical modification, enzyme
        digest, or N-terminal protein sequencing to try and answer a few of
        these questions.&nbsp; A
        little bit of knowledge about the molecule can help you restrict the number of returns obtained from an elemental
        calculator.&nbsp; Determining elemental composition from an exact mass
        measurement for a molecule which is essentially entirely unknown becomes
        difficult. In this case for the purpose of elemental composition determination
        usually exact mass measurements are performed on molecules&nbsp; below 500 amu with a required mass accuracy
        at or better than 5 mmu.&nbsp; With increasing mass the number of elemental combinations
        increases exponentially.&nbsp; One way to combat the large number of
        possibilities is to reduce the size of the unknown portion of the
        molecule.&nbsp; As mentioned above if the unknown is a protein, an enzyme digest may help
        reduce the size of the unknown portion of the compound, also if functional groups
        can be identified these masses can be subtracted from the measured mass to help
        reduce the number of returns.&nbsp; It is difficult to determine the
        elemental composition of&nbsp; larger entirely unknown molecules.&nbsp; This is not to say that exact mass of larger
        molecules is useless.&nbsp; This information can be used in conjunction
        with other analytical analyses and in this case it becomes a valuable
        tool.&nbsp; Exact mass is especially useful when a large part of the
        molecule is known and a minor unknown change needs to be
        characterized.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000080">Exact mass traditionally has been obtained by&nbsp;

        quadrupole time of flight type instruments.&nbsp;
        Some scientists attempt to push their <a href="http://www.rmsb.u-bordeaux2.fr/rmsb/ms/quadrupo.html" target="_blank"> quadrupole</a> mass spectrometers to
        obtain exact mass measurements.&nbsp; We have heard multiple report of
        scientists using their quradrupole instruments to obtain exact mass, and
        while we believe their reports, in our experience we have been unwilling to claim better than 100 mmu accuracy for
        several of the most popular triple quadrupole instruments that we have worked with.&nbsp;
        As stated previously a mass spectrometer can never be too accurate or
        possess too much resolving power. As a side note, some higher end
        MALDI instruments are capable of routinely delivering mass accuracy for
        peptides to 40 mmu without an internal standard and to 5-10 mmu with an
        internal standard. In our experience the better MALDI instruments have
        beat the standard quadrupole or triple quadrupole instrument for
        consistent mass accuracy for peptide mass measurement, especially for peptides
        below 2000 amu.&nbsp;</font></p>

        information from the A+1 and A+2 peaks. Look at the A+1 peak to estimate the
        number of carbon atoms, see the spectrum below.&nbsp; The number of carbon atoms should
        be 1.1 times the abundance of the A+1 peak.&nbsp; To estimate the number
        of carbons in this compound&nbsp; we would multiply 21.7 by 1.1 and our
        estimate for the number a carbons is 24.&nbsp; Since the abundance of
        the A+1 peak is&nbsp; a measured quantity it might be wise allow a range
        in this estimate of the carbon content of ~10% depending on the mass
        spectrometers accuracy.&nbsp; If your instrument is capable of a more stringent
        measurement of the A+1 peak abundance this will help out enormously.&nbsp; By inspecting the
        spectrum below no
        unusual &quot;A+2&quot; type elements were identified, the peak looks to

        2.&nbsp; At this point we can apply the nitrogen rule, the reader
        is referred to Fred McLafferty's book, <u> Interpretation of Mass
        Spectra</u>.&nbsp; The nitrogen rule states that if the molecular ion is odd
        then the compound will have an odd number of nitrogens.&nbsp; Since we
        are dealing with protonated species in electrospray and not molecular
        ions we can adapt the rule and restate it as, &quot;If the protonated
        pseudo molecular ion gives an odd mass then the number of nitrogens&nbsp;
        is even.&quot;&nbsp; Since our mass is odd the number of nitrogens is
        even and we can eliminate the top return and therefore the protonated
        elemental composition of our unknown is C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>43</sub>N<sub>8</sub>O<sub>9</sub>.</font></td>

        you get from an exact mass measurement must be reliable or it is not
        worth performing the experiment.&nbsp; One must be entirely confident of
        the instrument one is using and be aware of&nbsp; it's
        limitations.&nbsp; One good way to know your instrument is to measure
        test compounds of known composition.&nbsp; Another caution is <u>not</u>
        to limit any characterization just to an exact mass measurement. We
        advise you to learn as much about your molecule as possible.&nbsp; Here
        are just a few suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Much can be learned from
        chemical modification of the unknown followed by mass measurement.&nbsp;
        If you believe that the unknown molecule contains the amino acid residue
        cysteine try performing an alkylation.&nbsp; If you believe that the
        unknown contains primary amines try an acetylation.&nbsp; To discover
        unknown carboxyl groups (COOH) try a methylation.&nbsp; For example if
        one is able to identify two carboxyl groups by the addition of two
        methyl groups then 2(COOH), 89.9953 amu can be subtracted from the
        overall exact mass result.&nbsp; The new smaller number will return
        fewer hits from an elemental calculator.&nbsp; If enough material is
        available, usually mg amounts, NMR with exact mass is normally enough to
        give the elemental composition and in many cases solve the structure of
        the unknown.&nbsp; Another recommendation is to validate the results
        from any elemental calculator, the best calculators will allow user
        modification of the isotopic masses to bring them into agreement with
        the most current IUPAC values.</font></td>
