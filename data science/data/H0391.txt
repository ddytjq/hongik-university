Since the genetic code is redundant, multiple nucleotide sequences can encode the same peptide sequence. To be sure that the actual nucleotide sequence is present in a probe oligonucleotide, the oligonucleotide is synthesized incorporating, where needed, multiple nucleotides. The product is called a <strong>degenerate</strong> oligonucleotide. <a href="#Facts">Top</a>			<li><a name="ScreenE"></a><img src="i4151.gif" align="right">Antisera can be used to recognize clones of an <a href="MG416.html">expression library</a> that are synthesizing the cognate antigen.
