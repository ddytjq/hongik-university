<h1>Grattan Raceway Park</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Grattan Raceway is a 2.2-mile road course located northeast of Grand Rapids,
in southwestern lower Michigan.
Grattan sees widespread use for racing and is popular for testing (the TWR
Jaguar team preferred it to all other courses for testing their IMSA cars).
The track is in use most weekends from May through October; in addition to
<a href="/Organizations/SCCA/">SCCA</a>
sports car races, other automobiles and motorcycles are raced here, and Solo,
vintage, and marque club events are also frequently scheduled.
Motorcycle races at this track are sometimes televised.

This track map is one of the poorer ones, it grossly exaggerates the track
width and distorts the actual track configuration, and does not show all of
the access roads or any of the buildings and facilities.
But, it's the best one I've been able to find.

<h2><a name="GettingThere">
Getting to Grattan Raceway</a></h2>

The track is about 20 miles northeast of downtown Grand Rapids MI, on Lessiter
Road north of Grattan, a small town just off Route M-44 (Belding Road).
>From downtown Grand Rapids, there are two general ways to the track.

<h3><a name="RteI">I</a>: To go past motels and shopping:</h3>

>From I-96, take Exit 33 onto Plainfield Avenue northeast and proceed until
Plainfield ends at Route M-44.
Turn left (north) onto Route M-44 and cross the river.
There are motels, restaurants, fast-food outlets, filling stations, grocery
stores, department stores, and other shopping along Plainfield Avenue and Route
M-44 from I-96 all the way to the river.

<h3>II: The faster way to the track:</h3>

To bypass most non-expressway urban roads, take US-131 north to the West
River Drive interchange (Exit 93), and turn left onto West River Drive
eastbound.
Proceed east to Route M-44 (Northland NE) and turn left (north).

<h3>Then:</h3>

Continue on Route M-44 for 2.2 miles, up a fairly steep hill, and follow Route
M-44 where it turns right at the Belding Road traffic light.
Continue east on M-44 about 9 miles to Grattan, on a loop off to the left.
(The Grattan General Store, in the middle of town, is open 9-7 every day and
has a good selection at reasonable prices.)
Proceed east through town about half a mile to Lessiter Road, at an acute left;
this road is not clearly visible until you are nearly upon it.
Turn left and proceed north not quite a mile to the track on the west side of
the road.
Registration is in the two-story building on the right-hand side of the access
road.

A Racer's Guide to Grattan Raceway</a></h2>

<h3>The Paddock</h3>

Paddock space at Grattan is severely limited; most is inside the course,
where you must cross the track to enter and leave it.
Inside are two areas, the extra-cost paved Upper Paddock at the top of the
hill along the pits, and the Lower Paddock -- grass with some paved access
roads -- downhill south and east of the Upper Paddock.
At well-attended events, the flat grassy area north of the access road and
west of the registration building is also used as the Outer Paddock for high
ground-clearance cars (such as Showroom Stock and IT classes); generally,
impound and tech for these cars will be held in that paddock area.
Paved paddock costs $10 per space for the weekend; the spaces are small and two
or three are nearly always required, but worth it.
If you plan to stay on the paved paddock at well-attended events, it's
essential to arrive early on the preceding test day since these spaces are not
reserved and fill up rapidly.
Do not spill oil or gasoline onto, nor poke holes into, the paved surface
if you end up in the Upper Paddock.
<p>
Tech and Impound for the two inner paddock areas are on the south side of the
paved paddock, across from the garages.
Inside-the-track registration, hospitality, and driver's information are
located in the annex at the rear (south) of the tech building.
<p>
The competitor's facilities at Grattan are good.
There are flush toilets, running water, hot showers both in the paddock
concession building and in the registration building, and a swimming pool near
the registration building (usually an extra cost option).
Porta-Potties are scattered throughout the Lower and Outer Paddocks.
There is a food concession in the paddock with generally good food.
Air and water are available at the east end of the garages, leaded and
unleaded racing gasoline is available at the bottom of the hill at the east
end of the Upper Paddock.
The Hoosier tire distributor usually works out of the eastmost garage in the
Upper Paddock.
A few garages at the northeast corner of the Upper Paddock are available for
rent, and the track is usually available for rental for testing.
Test days before major events, organized by the track owners, provide
EMS services and corner staff.
Current prices and availability of garages and test days can be determined by
contacting the track management.

<h3>The Track</h3>

Grattan is a 2.2-mile track, with 11 flag stations and 13 or 14 turns (depending
on how fast you are going).
There is significant elevation change.
Every turn is blind, or off-camber, or changes direction abruptly at the
exit, or has a significant elevation or camber change in the turn or in the
braking area immediately before, or must be taken off the 'normal' line to
set up for the following corner.
<p>
Or exhibits two of these conditions.
<p>
Or more.
<p>
Some competitors claim that Grattan was designed by an individual who had a
clear understanding of the limits of racing cars and a pathological hatred of
racing car drivers.
<p>
There is some confusion about turn numbering at Grattan.
Track maps of different vintages show different numbers for some of the turns,
some maps show no numbers at all.
The turn numbering in this description is taken from the most recent track map
which shows turn numbers, one found on a 1995 race entry blank.
<p>
You work hard at Grattan; the main straight is really the only place where you
can relax for a moment, since the turns through the back of the track are so
close together.
Sight lines are problematical; you are busy at the exit of a very high-speed
corner when you should be looking at your pit area, and some of the corner
stations -- notably the one at Turn 7 -- are outside your normal view and
require you to take your eyes off the track.
The track surface is generally smooth, particularly where it has been recently
repaved; in fact parts have been seal-coated and can be extremely slippery on
hot days if the oil has not been washed off recently.
<p>
The false grid is on an access road south of the front straight and east of
the starter's stand; this road joins the track on the outside of Turn 3 -- you
will not see the condition of the track on the front straight and through
Turns 1 and 2 on the pace lap, and should be prepared for first-lap surprises
in those areas (unless there are two pace laps).
Passage between the paddock and the track for testing is non-obvious;
first-timers need to have it explained in detail (even then it's not always
obvious).
Grattan is a higher-speed course than it at first appears; CSR cars using all
five gears in a five-speed gearbox can exceed 135 MPH on the front straight and
take the slowest corner at about 65 MPH.
The ground off the edge of the track is smooth in most places, but is generally
rough and rutted from Turn 5 around through 7, and swampy near Turn 8.
<p>
What follows is a generic description of the track, describing its features
without defining speeds, gears, or shift points -- all of which will vary
widely from car type to car type.
<p>
Many of the turns at Grattan are sufficiently well separated by straights
that they may be treated as isolated turns, but there are three sets of
clustered turns (where your line through or out of a turn must be modified to
accomodate the requirements of the next turn or the one after it).
Turns 3 and 4 are a cluster, as are Turns 5 through 7, and Turns 8 through 10.
<p>
The starter's stand is about a third of the way down the front straight, and
is not visible beyond about the tenth row of the grid, but the front straight
(once part of a dragstrip) is wide enough that there are seldom difficulties
from a waved-off start -- and the Turn 10 flag station is visible up to the
last second, if they don't drop the yellow flag, it's not a start.
<p>
The track has been recently repaved from Turn 7 all the way around through
Turn 2, and all repaved areas except the front straight were widened
substantially.
The front straight is essentially flat, but rises gently in the braking area
before Turn 1.
There is a seam in the new paving in the braking area at the end of the front
straight just about a car-width off the left-hand edge of the pavement, if you
put a wheel on this seam your car will become very unstable under hard braking.
The banking at the end of the straight and into Turn 1 has been moved away
from the track surface, and a straight-ahead gravel-trap runoff area added;
this and the recent widening and repaving here have greatly reduced the
probability that you will hit the banking.
Turn 1 is a fast partially-blind right-hand 120-degree turn in which the
track rises sharply at the exit, allowing you to make a fairly early apex
because you can turn harder in the uphill section.
The turn starts out very wide but narrows at the exit to two cars wide.
Following a short uphill straight, Turn 2 is a partially-blind slow flat
90-degree right-hand turn; for many cars the apex comes into view about the
time you reach your turn-in point at the end of the uphill straight, drivers
of cars with high ground clearance and/or upright seating position will see
the turn-in point earlier.
<p>
You must get back to or near the right-hand side of the track during the
following short straight for the upcoming left-hand Turn 3, a most complex
piece of road.
Turn 3 is a 120-degree left-hand turn, and the entry is completely blind.
The track slopes sharply down just at the turn-in point for most cars, the
middle part of the turn is off camber, and the exit is off camber and uphill.
There is no real consensus on how to take Turn 3 except that you need to stay
as far to the left as you can throughout -- you cannot afford to be too far
toward the right edge of the track in the middle of the turn because the
surface is more steeply off-camber there, and you cannot be too far toward
the right at the exit because you must get back to the left on the following
uphill straight to enter Turn 4 properly.
You may be under full power from the apex of Turn 3 all the way through Turn
4, or you may need to lift slightly at the entry to 4 -- if you do not
normally lift when coming into Turn 4 after taking Turn 3 correctly, then
blowing Turn 3 will affect your speed all the way down into the esses.
Turn 3 is the site of many first-lap spins and agricultural excursions; be
extra watchful until the traffic opens out a little.
<p>
Turn 4, a fast downhill 95-degree right-hand turn, is an important turn and
must be taken correctly to assure high speed down the following back straight.
The track has been widened slightly at the exit of the turn.
Sound measurements are made on the outside of the track at the exit of Turn 4.
(Don't forget that Central Division tracks enforce a 105 dBA sound limit.)
Try to avoid going off at the exit of 4, there are trees uncomfortably close by
even though some runoff areas and barriers have been added.
<p>
The following somewhat bumpy straight (it's not exactly straight but close
enough) goes downhill and flattens out, then crests a small hill or hump just
before the right-hand Turn 5, the first turn of the Esses.
You must experiment with your braking into Turn 5; the track takes a slight
kink to the left just at the hump, and is then level for only a very short
distance before the turn.
You
<b>may</b>
be able to delay your braking until you have stabilized the car on the downhill
side of the hump; if you are forced to do part of your braking on the uphill
side, be very smooth so you don't lock the brakes as you come unstuck at the
top and downhill side.
You should place your car a few feet from the left edge of the track surface
as you come up to the hump, and make your slight kink to the left
<b>before</b>
the hump so that you will be pointed dead straight at your turn-in point as you
go over the top and complete your braking.
A certain amount of experimentation and practice are required here; a test day
the first time you come to Grattan is a good idea.
<p>
The first two turns in the Esses, Turns 5 and an unnumbered Turn (5A) are 
fairly slow 70- or 80-degree turns that move towards and begin to climb up the
side of the hill.
The straights between these turns are short (shorter between 5A and 6), but
long enough that you will speed up and slow down again between each turn (if
you find yourself shifting up and down between the turns you're geared wrong).
Turn 6, the third turn in the Esses, is a slower 90-degree uphill right-hand
turn that leaves you at the crest of the hill.
The Esses don't look like much from the paddock at the top of the hill, but
that view is very deceptive!!
<p>
The critical point about the Esses is that you
<b>must</b>
exit Turn 6 close to the right edge of the track; this in turn means that you
must exit Turn 5A close to the left edge, and must exit Turn 5 somewhere on
the right half of the surface and be able to get back to the right edge before
entering Turn 5A.
If you do not take these Esses properly, you will go off uphill on the right
entering Turn 6 (the ground is badly torn up here where lots of cars have done
just that), or you will be set up entirely wrong for the following difficult
Turn 7.
<p>
At the exit of Turn 6 is a very short straight leading into Turn 7, another
diabolical piece of road.
Turn 7 is a short-radius steeply-banked 135-degree left-hand turn that you
enter downhill and exit uphill directly into a high-speed climbing slightly
off-camber right-hand turn.
This turn is known as the 'Teacup', the 'Sugar Bowl', or the 'Toilet Bowl',
depending largely on how badly you get through it (it's just at the west end
of the Upper Paddock, and is the most popular spectator area at the track, of
course).
Each type of car has a different best (actually, least bad) line through Turn
7; in general you have to complete your braking before entering it (you're
going to get a little light as you go downhill into the turn) and take a very
late apex on the uphill right-hand turn at the exit.
The road is widened slightly at the turn-in point.
<p>
Trying to pass on the inside coming into the Toilet Bowl is very dicey -- if
you make an early apex you will be in some difficulty at the exit; and if your
intended passee doesn't cooperate but stays with and outside of you through
the Bowl, you will be in a great deal of difficulty at the exit.
<p>
High exit speed and proper track position at the exit are of utmost importance
at Turn 7 because it leads into a high-speed portion of the course, a series
of uphill and downhill fast right-hand kinks and short straights that change
direction through a total of about 120 degrees.
Be extremely careful when you come up out of the Toilet Bowl that you do not
miss the turn-in point for the first right-hand kink at the top of the hill.
Your car will be a little light here and the kink is partially blind and
slightly off camber, and if you miss it you're likely to slide down a grassy
slope into a recently-installed and unprotected two-high Armco fence (hitting
it is little better than hitting the trees, which you may do anyway if you
become airborne down the slope).
The safety staff have a lurid little tale to tell about each stump and
broken-off tree.
<p>
You should treat the fast right-trending downhill section past the Bowl as a
straight with occasional kinks, and
<b>try</b>
to take the entire section flat out, although since widening and repaving it's
a lot faster and you will likely have to lift for the last kink and possibly
some of the earlier ones.
Again, some experimentation will be required, and a test day the first time you
go to Grattan is a good idea.
<p>
If you take the last kink properly, you will be positioned at the proper
braking point on the downhill entrance into Turn 8.
Don't leave the track surface near Turn 8 or you'll find out why it's called
the Swamp turn; it's a wide but tight and slow 110-degree off-camber
right-hand turn followed immediately by a tight 20-degree kink back to the
left.
If you follow a normal line through the first (right-hand) portion, the
second (left-hand) kink will force you towards the right edge of the track
and you may have to struggle to get through traffic back over to the left
edge for Turn 9.
Alternately, you might try treating the right-hand portion as being just a
slightly tighter 90-degree right-hand turn, and exit a little slower but
along the left edge of the sharply uphill straight section and positioned
correctly -- although on the outside -- for Turn 9.
<p>
Turn 9 is a wide blind-entry slightly uphill fast 60-degree right-hand turn
followed by a short straight and an unnumbered partially-blind very wide and
very fast 60-degree left-hand turn out onto the front straight (I'm going to
call it Turn 10).
If you have taken Turn 9 properly, you will be able to make what looks like
a slightly early apex in Turn 10 and sweep wide across the track under full
power.
If you take Turns 9 and 10 properly, you should be under power (maybe not full
power) all the way from the exit of Turn 8 to the end of the front straight.
<p>
The pit entrance is reached by keeping well to the right at the exit of Turn 9
and proceeding directly across the front straight, then turning hard left.
The Upper Paddock, and Tech and Impound, are reached from the east end of the
pit lane by making a tight U-turn to the right and proceeding steeply uphill.

Camping is permitted at the track for a nominal charge (no electrical plugins
or RV hookups), but most motels are a considerable distance away.
This list was last updated in August 1996, using information from the AAA Tour
Book, race entry forms, various motel chain accomodation guides, local
telephone directories, Internet search resources, and personal observation.
Prices where shown are per night in a two-person two-bed room; an 'AAA'
indicates that discounts are available to AAA members; 'FS&S' or 'F&S' indicate
that special weekend rates are available; a 'P indicates that pets are
permitted, sometimes at a small charge ('$P') and an 'NP' indicates that pets
are not permitted.
This list is in order generally by increasing distance from the track;
accomodations in the smaller towns east and north of the track are reached
primarily on open secondary roads, while roads to those in and around Grand
Rapids proper are generally more congested.
