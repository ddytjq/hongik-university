A Note from Jimmy Summers</h2>
  
      <h4> Vice President of the <a href="http://www.ichl.org/">Intercollegiate
Hockey League</a>
, Coach of the Texas A&amp;M Ice Hockey Team, and Division III Western Region
Coordinator for the <a href="http://www.achahockey.org/">American Collegiate
Hockey Association</a>
      </h4>
 In the league I have placed a emphasis on control and responsibility for 
one's actions on and off the ice, and the development of skills. Physical 
and skilled hockey is great and our games, like most college hockey games, 
are checking games, played by NCAA rules, but you can play a physical game 
and still have a highly skilled one too. I emphasize to my team and stress 
to others in the league that we want skilled hockey games that are played 
well. I want games that are enjoyable for players and fans, and want the players
to be able to continue to play for many years to come without severe injuries.&nbsp; 
      <p>I have talked to many hockey players who have played in college
and at the semi-pro level, and they think my idea and direction is a good
one. The amount of support for this idea that I have received is wonderful. 
I am hoping to be an instigator of change in the sport to show that it can
be played well, with a emphasis on skills development, and be exciting without
resorting to violence or cheap shots. That may be a lofty goal, but I hope
to be part of making it happen. </p>

      <p><b>Ice hockey.</b> The absolute number of ice hockey injuries is
low, but the fatality and catastrophic injury rates per 100,000 participants 
are higher than in many other sports. Catastrophic injuries in ice hockey 
usually occur when an athlete is struck from behind or falls and hits the 
crown of his or her head on the boards, resulting in fractured cervical vertebrae
and paralysis. </p>
      <p>Tator et al (5), who did an extensive survey on catastrophic injuries 
in Canadian ice hockey, recommended the following: </p>
      <ul>
 <li> Enforce current rules and consider new rules against pushing or checking 
from behind;</li>
  <li> Develop conditioning programs to help players strengthen their neck
muscles;</li>
  <li> Teach players about the risk of neck injury; and</li>
  <li> Continue epidemiologic research.</li>
 
      </ul>

masks resurfaces</a>
      </h1>
  
      <h3> Mike Chambers, Special to The Denver Post</h3>
 Pick your poison. When it comes to the safety of its hockey players, the 
NCAA has done just that with its mandatory face mask rule. Most college hockey
coaches and officials have seen enough cross checks to the head and kamikaze
checks into the boards to understand that a virus is spreading. The definition
of this toxin: Too much equipment--particularly face masks--have turned the
game into a violent sport between frustrated gladiators. Those opposed to
the face mask rule suggest an exposed face would add respect for one's opponent,
as well as provide better peripheral vision, more regard from the professional
ranks and improved identification with the fans.&nbsp;

      <h2> Introduction</h2>
 While those who consider themselves part of the hockey community embrace 
The Game, hockey is a minority sport, particularly college hockey within the
world of college athletics. This increases the importance of a sense of community
among those who play, coach, work, and follow college hockey. 
      <p>To establish and maintain a sense of community, we can not ignore
the way the game itself is played. The stability of our hockey community
is based on how everyone within the community carries out his or her responsibilities 
related to The Game.&nbsp;</p>
