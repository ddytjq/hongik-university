 If you're having problems getting java to be 
found at different 
directories try modifiying the .java_wrapper file, like this.  I replaced 
each of the java, javac, javah, etc soft-linked files with the .java_wrapper
file with the first two lines modified so that it referred specifically 
to the executable.

So java used to point to .java_wrapper.  Now it has its own shell script
with the first two lines replaced.
<hr>
<b>OLD:</b><br>


PRG=`which $0` >/dev/null 2>&1<br>
J_HOME=`dirname $PRG`/.<br>

<b>NEW:</b><br>

PRG=/usr/local/java/bin/java<br>
J_HOME=/usr/local/java<br>
<hr>

Each of the executables, javac, javah, etc. has a similar file.  I know its
redundant, but it works.

Regarding trapping keystrokes, I was able to do that--I didn't try
keyDown because I have learned to distrust all but the handleEvent
procedure, but they do make it until there.
<p>
Tip of the day: Put a statement<p><b>

if (evt.id != Event.MOUSE_MOVE)
<br> System.out.println(evt);</b>
<p>
into every handleEvent function.
<p>
Tip 2. NEVER return false from an event handler. It propagates the
event to the parent in the containment hierarchy before the parent in
the inheritance hierarchy (i.e. Component) has a chance to distribute
the event to the mouse/keyboard/action functions Instead reissue the
handler on super.

Paul Cole writes in comp.lang.java about how to extend the Linux Beta1:<p>

Try grabbing the win95 distribution and steal the TextArea.java from
the src/java/awt/TextArea.java, javac that sucker, keep an original of
your classes/awt/TextArea.class and copy the resulting class from your
compile into it.  Unless there's somethign that 1.0beta2 TextArea.java
wants to do that java 1.0beta1 can't compile. it should work.  You
might have to recompile more than one of the classes if the new
TextArea.java uses an extended interface of TextAreaPeer or
TextComponent etc, but I do not think that is the case. 
<i><br>
 </i><br>
<hr>
 Cay Horstmann writes in comp.lang.java about printing doubles:<p>
The easiest way (i.e. least keystrokes) is
<p>
        double x = 3.14;
<br>        String s = ""+x;
<p>
Sure, the purists will tell you to use fromDouble or valueOf or some
such function that you can't remember for five minutes after you
looked it up. The ""+ trick works fine and is only marginally less
efficient.
<i><br>

<hr>Comment to first hint.

There are more simlier and elegant way to do this:

You may replace:

PRG=`which ...............`

with

PRG=$0

  PLEASE, please !!Please!! don't use K&R indentation style!! It is
  CONFUSING, and highly unmaintainable! K&R looks like:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
class HelloWorld { <-- see this brace? it should be on the next line,
                       at the same "tab stop" as its closing brace.

  public static void main (String args[]) { <-- Same thing. This is K&R.

    System.out.println("Hello World!");

  }
  
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>
  In my (not so) humble opinion, open braces should _always_ be at the same
  "tab stop" as their matching close brace.
</p>
<p>
  The above should look like this:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
class HelloWorld 
{
  public static void main (String args[]) 
  {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>
  By extension, this:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
if(...) {
    what.ever();
} else {
    what.ever.else{};
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>
  Should look more like this:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
if(...) 
{
    what.ever();
} 
else 
{
    what.ever.else{};
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>
  You want your programs to be EASY to read, which K&R style is not.

CLASS2HTML - Another HTML wrapper for Java Class Applets (accomodates Linux's JAVA Binary support)..
	     I took the original idea from "wraphtml", which appears on this
             page, and made some more modifications and additions. 
	     This Perl program will create an HTML file which will allow you
             to view your Java Applet in either the appletviewer or Netscape.
	     It accomodates Linux's Java Binary support. Please check it out 
	     at <a
href="http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~dsd75511/class2html.pl">CLASS2HTML.PL</a>.

JAC - This Perl script can be used as a common interface to
      compile JAVA source files with any one of the following 
      JAVA compilers:

		1) javac
		2) guavac
		3) kaffe
		4) netscape

      Assuming, of course, that you have one or all of 
      these JAVA compilers installed on your system.
      It will prompt the user for the compiler to use.
      It accomodates Linux's Java Binary support. 
      You must modify (within the script itself) the path 
      to each of the compilers and the $CLASSFILE path 
      to suit your own system's configuration.
      Please check it out at <a

Comment to Jim Lynch's comment.

Jim, I don't agree with you about the old K&R indentation style. In fact, I've
been using it for more than ten years, and I will explain you why!.
It happened to me seven years ago, while I was writting a boring accounting
program. At that time I used the PASCAL style indentation (the one you propose),
cause I learnt PASCAL before C. I was enjoying C, because I didn't have to think
about the final ";" anymore (as in PASCAL I used to do). In C, every sentence ends
with the ";", was my "thumb rule". But, look what happend to me:

	for(i=0; i<100; i++);
	{
		*pointer_array[i] = NULL;
	}

Have you seen the ";" after the for sentence?. I didn't. And the compiler didn't
too. In fact this is not a nonsense in C, but a set of one sentence
(a no-body for) and one block of sentences.

Two weeks later I discovered this hidden fault, and that day I promised myself
not to use anymore this PASCAL indentation style. So this sentences became:

	for(i=0; i<100; i++) {
		*pointer_array[i] = NULL;
	}

And one ending ";" at the first line was quickly detected by the compiler as an
error.

So, PLEASE, learn through my experience!<i><br>

<hr>In java you have a built in class called Object class. This class is at the
root of java class heirarchy. So you can define an Object type reference variable
to have the reference of any class instance. In other words you have got the
universal type reference variable.
e.g.
Object refVariable = new AnyClassConstructor(); 
Also if you want to subclass Object class you can omit the "extends" clause 
because the compiler will automatically include it. <i><br>

<hr>Mark Wutka sent me this email about how to zip classes and create
cab files for Java archiving.  
<p>
You can zip classes into a single .zip file using a zip archiver like 
Info-Zip from:<br>
<a href="http://quest.jpl.nasa.gov/Info-ZIP">http://quest.jpl.nasa.gov/Info-ZIP</a>
<p>

PKZIP usually doesn't work because it doesn't support long filenames.
Also, you have to create the .zip file with no compression.  If you
had all your class files in a single directory, you could zip them
into a file called SesameStreet.zip this way:<br>
zip -0 SesameStreet.zip *.class<br>
The -0 (that's a zero) turns off compression. Although the data is
not compressed, this still improves download times dramatically,
because many classes are so small that you spend the bulk of the
download time actually making the net connection, while with a
.zip file, there is only one connection.
<p>
The .zip files can only be used for Netscape. For Internet Explorer,
it's even better, because their class archive format, called the Cabinet,
supports compression, too. You can get the Cabinet development kit for
free from Microsoft at<br>

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/java/cab-f.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/java/cab-f.htm</a><br>
<p>
You could create SesameStreet.cab from the same directory you
create SesameStreet.zip like this:<br>
cabarc -r -p n SesameStreet.cab *.class
<p>
The neat thing is that you can supply either a .zip file, a .cab file,
or the original .class files from a single .html file, meaning you
can give your users whatever they can handle.  You specify a .zip
file as the archive parameter in the applet tag, while you specify
the .cab file as a PARAM tag. For example:
<p>

applet archive="SesameStreet.zip" code="LoadManager.class" width=2
height=2<br>
param name="cabbase" value="SesameStreet.cab"

Not a hint per se, rather an observation for C++ programmers
making the conversion to Java.  Don't bemoan the lack of
templates in Java - you do NOT need them. IMHO, Templates
in C++ fulfill the role of allowing container classes to be
generic without an object-rooted class hierarchy. Java comes
with a standard class hierarchy that lets you put any object
into a container, or to easily constrain a container to a
particular type. (Beware the principles of co- and contra-
variance when doing so, creating a new container class that
has more specific formal in-parms <b>and</b> out-parms creates
a class that loses the ISA nature of class inheritance. But
this is not a factor in C++ anyway :-)<i><br>

<hr>Hello I'm running the Redhat Linux distribution for the last few months and I
just downloaded the Linux JDK from the blackdown.org mirror list.

Everything is running okay, except that I'm having something really wierd
happen when I start up an applet. I'll do:

appletviewer Scum.html &

The applet will start in the upper left hand corner of the screen, and start
running, but a split second after it starts it shifts its window position
about 20 pixels or so to the left and about 20 pixels up.  This means that I 
can't even drag the window around or anything because the title bar is off
screen.  The applet then runs just like normal.

Anyone have ideas why this could be happening?

If so, please e-mail me. jstanley@up.edu
Thanks in advance.

In regards to the K&R style of coding, and the desperate plea
not to use it....Foo Bar!  Real programmers don't do that.
Before speaking up about something you have little experience
with, do a little research.  I can't even understand a person
who uses pascal style braces.  Duh. 
<i><br>
marc Silicon Valley, Oregon</i><br>
<hr>Just to further my point about the idiot flaming K&R style coding.
Why don't you take a look at the source code for jave (since that
is what this list is about), and explain how sun(tm) has managed
to maintain their code by *using* K&R style coding.  Hmmmm,
peculiar...idiot

--flame off--<i><br>
marc (again) </i><br>
<hr>I agree with mark.  PASCAL style takes up too much vertical space, and makes the
code unreadable.  With your white space, you should ONLY be enphasising the 
important code.

K&R style is only used because the orininal C books for non-code reasons.
Obviously, matching braces help guide the eye to blocks of code; K&R style is
from the old days when we had to save lines on the screen becayse they only 
had 20 lines and scrolling was painful.  C'mon, enter the modern age.

I have a comment on this "war" over K&R style vs. Pascal style.  I personally
prefer the Pascal style because it is what I'm used to writing, and therefore,
I find it easier to read. However, saying that one style is better than another
is vanity.  They both get the job done, they both can be clear or unclear.  
Programmers as a whole (watch out, here comes a generalization) believe that 
whatever they do is the best, and everything else is crap.  While this confidence
is, at times, nice, it's also counterproductive in many cases.  Arguing over who's style 
of code writing is the best is ridiculous.  I work with people who code in both
styles, and I have to read both on a regular basis.  For me to force someone
to write in a style they aren't comfortable with, just so it's easier for me
to read is stupid.  If the job gets done quicker and with less bugs when they 
use their style than everyone wins.  

As far as our friend in Spain, Eduardo.  I'm glad you shared your 
experience in debugging with us, but it's foolish of you to think that just
because you had difficulty solving the problem of a "no body for" statement
(a problem that every first year Computer Science student SHOULD learn to 
avoid and look for while debugging), that changing to the K&R style will 
solve that problem for everyone. It is interesting to note, however, that had 
you written your problem code using the style Jim suggested, rather than a 
one line style, you should also have been able to avoid such a problem.  
But, if K&R style now works for you, and helps you avoid the problem again,
fantastic, code in good health.

Now a comment to our angry friend Marc.  Sir, you seem to find this topic to 
be a personal attack.  I understand you have a preference but you reveal a 
great deal of your immaturity with your vengeful comments.  How does one 
person's preference affect you so greatly?  And while the programmers at Sun may 
have indeed used the K&R style, this doesn't make it the ONLY right way.
Bill Gates may code in Japanese, that doesn't mean we all have to, nor would 
we want to. And who is to say that REAL programmers only code in one way.  
Apparently they don't, or else we would have gotten this far to begin with.   

So, my programming friends, I beg of you to put an end to this pointless
arguing over who's way is better.  Share your experiences and solutions as 
Eduardo did, and as others here do.  But don't attack someone because they 
did or would do it differently. It's our differences in the way we program 
that keeps our profession exciting. Variety IS the spice of life. 

I apologize for taking up so much room, but I felt it had to be said.

<hr>Hia' Jim, I've come to comment on your comment here :)

Don't listen to people that say:
"PLEASE, please !!Please!! don't use K&R indentation style!! It is CONFUSING, and highly unmaintainable!"

Just tell them to get a formatter.

If you want one, try Artistic Style at:
http://gene.md.huji.ac.il/~tald/astyle/
or JStyle at:
http://gene.md.huji.ac.il/~tald/jstyle/

For those who like your code one way, and work with someone writing in another style, Don't get on their case, it just makes you annoying, and is not productive. The code is the code, where ever you like your braces.

Personally, I like my lines of code close together, it lets you see more of it, and reads like a story. Also, it makes it clear where a method is, rather than just another line of code. (One where you might put a ";").

So, K&R to your harts content... the other guy can re-format it... and it will only take him/her a second to do...

Commenting on the K&R indentation style:  I'm a first year Computer Science student at Auckland University and we are learning the K&R way.  I don't see what all the big fuss is about.  Whichever way you indent doesn't matter.  You the programer should indent the way you feel most comfortable reading and writing.  The Professors tell us that programing is not a sort of set thing.  Everyone has there own sort of styles etc.  Just get over it.<i><br>
Richard Hutchinson New Zealand</i><br>

<hr>An extension of what Mike suggested in source styling

for(...)
{
   ...
}

I do a 

for(...)
   {
   ...
   }

While this admittedly takes vertical space, character-wise it is not a 
large burden as in ASCII, CR is same as SPC. What this achieves is
making a block out of a nested group of statements. Furthermore,
by indenting the { and }, all statements in one level of the flow
appear separately as in

for(...)
   {
   ...
   }
if (...)
   {
   ...
   }

Here, the for and if are at one level and stand out as such almost as if they
are bulletted. Since I pay a lot of attention to styling, I have written
progs as above out of the logic (it is quite catching), and then done it
the K&R way so that others could read it easily. Also, though I learnt
Pascal before C, I started using this only after I learnt C. Anyone with
the psychoanalysis of it?

<hr>Regarding the indentation style argument: Hasn't anyone read Steve McConnell's 
book <em>Code Complete</em>? If not, you owe it to yourself to read it cover 
to cover. Any programmer should, no matter what level you're at. Anyway, 
it has the best analysis of several different 
styles of indentation, and basically comes to the conclusion that K&R is best, 
but is sure to emphasis that it's not worth a holy war to try to convert 
someone.

<hr>This may be getting out of hand, but I would like to add my .02 on the K&R vs. Pascal
indentation debate. I find K&R to be the best, because it allows me to see the
maximum number of lines on the screen at once. Some claim that it is unreadable
because one can't tell as easily where a piece of bracketed code begins and ends.
But I can't imagine why this is a problem - wasn't this why the code itself was
indented in the first place? Giving the bracket a line to itself is unnecessary,
IMNSHO. It's nothing I'd start a flamewar about, but I prefer to code this way.<i><br>

Regarding coding style, I use both.  Functions are always Pascal formatted, this allows me to find the beginning and end of classes and functions quickly.  However if/else/for and while statements use K&R.  This is because the braces are not mandatory! But when I want them to be, I explicity put them at the end of the statement.  Also an indication of when a statment block is too long is when you find it hard to match braces.  Then break it up into functions or rethink the logic.  It works for me.<i><br>

Someone can call/insert JavaScript methods from/to Java applets by importing
Netscape's JavaScript package[*]. This could be a good thing for many reasons.
Since u use cross scripting issues things should work both in ie (ugh really)
and Nav (except Nav4.6 which has a LiveConnect bug in it). For instance the
following applet opens a new browser window, then puts some text onto it by
calling JavaScript methods:

import java.applet.*;
import netscape.javascript.*;

public class toJavascript extends Applet
{
   // decalring JavaScript wrapper:
   JSObject window;

   public void init()
   {
      try
      {
         // wrapping the js window object into java object:
         window  = JSObject.getWindow(this);

         // calling the eval method of the object to open new window:
         window.eval("winNew=open('','','toolbar=no')");

         // wrapping the new window object via the opener:
         JSObject winNew = (JSObject) window.getMember("winNew");

         // put some text onto it:
         winNew.eval("document.open();document.write('hello form second window');document.close();");
      }
      catch (Exception e)
      {
         java.lang.System.out.println (e + " caught.");
      }
    }
}

Flogging the K&R horse: for those who aren't about to drop the cash on <TITLE>Code Complete</TITLE>, here is the gist of why to use this over the "Pascal" method. See, I used to use that, until I was converted by this explanation; suddenly, with understanding, the confusion of opening braces at the ends of lines was lifted. </P>

In Ada, which is the most thoroughly engineered language around, every control construct use the same format, called "pure blocks":<CODE>
if condition then
    statement1;
    statement2;
end if;
case variable of
    when constant1 =>
        statement1;
        statement2;
    when constant2 =>
        statement3;
        statement4;
end case
</CODE>
So what you have to see is that, in Java and C, the opening brace is really taking the place of <CODE>then</CODE> or <CODE>of</CODE> and the closing brace takes the place of the <CODE>end</CODE> terminator. So to code an if block as<CODE>
if (condition)
{
    statement1;
    statement2;
}
</CODE>
would be equivalent to<CODE>
if condition
then
    statement1;
    statement2;
end if;
</CODE>
which I think you'll agree looks asinine. While I also agree that the whole issue is nothing for anyone to get their panties in a bunch over, I must reiterate that, once I understood the reasoning, this looked far better. Perhaps coincidentally, my coding improved in general, and I have an easier time spotting deeply indented sections that should be removed to a separate method.</P>
Also, for those who find it difficult to see how things line up without the brackets lining up, a few suggestions: As someone else mentioned, get a programming tool such as Programemr's File Editor (PFE, which is freeware) and stop coding in a flat text editor - let it work for you. PFE in particular will handle indentation and brace matching automatically. Including more whitespace will make reading easier overall, and serve to group related code. If you have so much code in your method that you can't keep track of the braces fairly easily, it is a safe bet that you haven't abstracted enough, and are in danger of writing spaghetti code or worse.</P>
And one final thing on another topic that hasn't been mentioned here: Java will most quickly access the first 3 variables assigned in a given method, plus <CODE>this</CODE>. Parameters are counted first, then locals. So if you have a method with, say, two parms and five locals, and one parm and one of the locals are going to get hammered while the others are only used once each, it's a good idea to<CODE>
void method(int hammeredParm, int rareParm) {
    int hammered1;
    /* other local defs, code, etc. */
    ...
}
</CODE>
This way, it only takes a single bytecode to reference <CODE>this, hammeredParm, rareParm, hammered1</CODE> each. Of course, you won't see a difference unless the method itself is intensely complex or run <STRONG>very</STRONG> frequently, but in that case it can make a difference (and I have the benchmarks to prove it).<i><br>

My apologies - I thought this would recognize the &;lt;code&gt; tag, but it didn't. Here's the code again with &;lt;pre&gt; tags instead:

Ada:
<PRE>
if condition then
    statement1;
    statement2;
end if;
case variable of
    when constant1 =>
        statement1;
        statement2;
    when constant2 =>
        statement3;
        statement4;
end case
</PRE>
"Bad" Java:
<PRE>
if (condition)
{
    statement1;
    statement2;
}
</PRE>
would be equivalent to
<PRE>
if condition
then
    statement1;
    statement2;
end if;
</PRE>
which I think you'll agree looks asinine.</P>
I won't bother with the last example - it should be clear enough.<i><br>

<hr>Regarding indentation style:

K&R indentation style is used through the Sun code, and as such should be
considered "the standard" for Java (in the same way that thisKindOfVariableName
is standard, rather than this_kind_of_variable_name).  This is laid out in
"Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language" as published by Sun
(see http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html).<i><br>
William Webber Melbourne, Victoria, Australia</i><br>
<hr>
Don't waste time arguing about indentation styles.  There are ways to
automagically convert between them.  Learn good programming habits instead.
Check for ALL return values from system functions, program for environments
that are independent of byte sex and word size.  Use LOTS of comments.
