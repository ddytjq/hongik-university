<H1>ASTRONOMERS DISCOVER AN INFRARED BACKGROUND GLOW IN THE UNIVERSE </H1>

<P>Astronomers have assembled the first definitive detection of a background
infrared glow across the sky produced by dust warmed by all the stars that
have existed since the beginning of time.</P>

<P>For scientists, the discovery of this &quot;fossil radiation&quot; is
akin to turning out all the lights in a bedroom only to find the walls,
floor and ceiling aglow with an eerie luminescence.</P>

<P>The telltale infrared radiation puts a limit on the total amount of
energy released by all the stars in the universe. Astronomers say this
will greatly improve development of models explaining how stars and galaxies
were born and evolved after the Big Bang.</P>

<P>The discovery reveals a surprisingly large amount of starlight in the
universe cannot be seen directly by today's optical telescopes, perhaps
due to stars being hidden in dust, or being too faint or far away to be
seen. </P>

<P>The discovery culminates several years of meticulous data analysis from
the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment aboard NASA's <A HREF="http://space.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/cobe">Cosmic
Background Explorer (COBE)</A>, which was launched in 1989. The difficulty
in making the discovery is analogous to listening for a faint background
hum in a shopping mall full of people talking, music playing, and other
noises.</P>

<P>&quot;This is another big step in bringing cosmology to a science based
on observation as well as theory,&quot; said Michael Hauser of the Space
Telescope Science Institute, Baltimore, MD, principal investigator on the
Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment. </P>

<P>Reporting the results at the meeting of the American Astronomical Society
in Washington, DC, Hauser added: &quot;We set out to do this 23 years ago,
and these results show it was worth it. Our discovery fulfills the third
and final cosmology objective of the Cosmic Background Explorer mission.&quot;</P>

<P>LOST STARLIGHT</P>

<P>The unexpected preponderance of far infrared light implies that many
stars have &quot;fallen between the cracks&quot; in ultra- sensitive visible
light probes of the distant corners of the universe, such as the Hubble
Deep Field.</P>

<P>One possible explanation is that the universe is very dusty, with many
stars hidden in blankets of dust. Alternatively, many stars may have been
born in a flurry of activity in the very early universe but faded away
at earlier times than yet reached with large telescopes.</P>

<P>In either scenario, the existence of hidden stars is revealed by telltale
dust which absorbs and re-radiates their light at infrared wavelengths,
and so a permanent record of their existence is encoded in the infrared
background.</P>

<P>UNCOVERING THE INFRARED BACKGROUND</P>

<P>Data from two other instruments on the Cosmic Background Explorer have
already yielded the precise spectrum and a detailed map of another cosmological
fossil (first discovered in the 1960s), the microwave background radiation
from the Big Bang.</P>

<P>But finding the infrared background was not easy. Unlike the <A HREF="http://map/html/cbr.html">cosmic
microwave background</A>, which at millimeter wavelengths outshines everything
else in the universe, the infrared background is masked by infrared light
from nearby dust in our solar system, stars and interstellar dust in the
Milky Way Galaxy, and, for ground-based instruments, emission from the
Earth's atmosphere and from the instrument itself. The COBE mission overcame
the last two problems by observing from space using a small telescope and
instrument cooled to within a few degrees of absolute zero.</P>

<P>The COBE science team began by using the Diffuse Infrared Background
Experiment to scan half the entire sky once a week, over a 10-month period
from Dec. 1989 to Sept. 1990. Astronomers then modeled and subtracted the
infrared glow from foreground objects in our solar system, our galaxy's
stars, and vast clouds of cold dust between the stars of our Milky Way.</P>

<P>Solar system dust was fairly easy to identify in the data because its
brightness changes from week to week as Earth orbits the Sun. The interstellar
dust of our Galaxy was identified in the data because it has structure,
and so looks different across the sky. Light from stars was removed using
a detailed model based on counts of the many types of stars in the various
parts of the Galaxy.</P>

<P>When infrared light from these sources was subtracted from the all-sky
maps, the astronomers found a smooth background of residual infrared light
in the 240 and 140 micrometer wavelength bands in &quot;windows&quot; near
the north and south poles of the Milky Way, which provided a relatively
clear view across billions of light years.</P>

<P>Astronomers next plan to probe the early formation of stars and galaxies
using infrared telescopes on new space missions such as the Space Telescope
Infrared Facility, Wide Field Infrared Explorer, Next Generation Space
Telescope and the Far Infrared Space Telescope, and hope some day to make
more infrared background measurements using instruments launched deep into
the solar system to escape the interplanetary dust.</P>
