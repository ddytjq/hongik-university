The "Spirit of the Game" was and isthe most exalted of all the GUTS traditions. And if two teams couldnot decide a call, there was a re-throw. With the result of there-throw generating the adage, "Frisbee never Lies."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">During the early growth of disc sports, themost honorable and spirited players were the ones who were mostrespected. Early players like Goldy Norton, the Healy Brothers, andSky King Richardson played the game with truth, honor and spirit.They were great examples. Then as the game of GUTS grew, with teamspracticing year round and more and more prize money being offered,the "Spirit of the Game" started to be challenged.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">The option of using observers was given toteams. Observers were other GUTS players who were selected to observea match and were only called in when both teams could not reach adecision. This prevents long arguments which disrupts the momentum ofthe match, but leaves the game in the hands of the players. Despitethe option to use observers, most GUTS matches are still playedwithout them. They are usually only used when rivals play each other.Most matches are still played under the "Spirit of the Game."  Whereeach team makes its own call and if it can&#130;t be settled, thereis a re-throw.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">	The "Spirit of the Game" of GUTS isdifferent then Ultimate. They both have the same characteristics ofhonor and "call what you see," but differ in the way they areapplied. Because of the high intensity and psych needed to catch adisc going 80 mph, GUTS players have to be fired up and try tointimidate their opponent. But it is not personal. It's all part ofthe game of GUTS. So the antics you see after a player making a cleancatch or throwing an 80 mph rocket, is all just a piece of theexcitement of the game. GUTS players are warriors on the field andbest friends off . So do not be dismayed when you see what appears tobe a breach of the "Spirit of the Game," it's only GUTS playersshowing their side of the "Spirit of the Game." Remember the "FRISBEENEVER LIES."</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">------</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><B>GUTS TERMS</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">ACE: A legal throw which is untouched bythe defensive team.

Two,five person teams, line up 45 feet (14 m.) apart, facing each other.The game is played to 21 points. The object of the game is to try andthrow the disc through the opposing team without them making a cleancatch. If the throw is successful, the offensive team receives onepoint. A successful throw must be within reach of any one player onthe defensive team. If a throw is wide, short or high, the defensiveteam receives one point. The defensive team must attempt to make aclean catch. A clean catch is one that is 1.) Not trapped against thebody 2.) Not touched with two hands or two parts of the body. 3.) Youmay tip or deflect the disc to a teammate. A clean catch results inno point for the throwing team.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">	If a point is scored, the 1st player whotouches the disc must return the throw. If there is a catch, theplayer who made the catch returns the throw. If there is a bad throw,the offensive team may choose any player to return the throw. Ifthere is an ace(no player touches the disc), the throwing team mayselect a player whom they want to return the throw. If a throw isvertical (over 90 degrees), it is a bad throw and the defensive teamreceives a point. A foot fault (stepping on the line) violationresults in loss of throw for the offensive team. If there is adispute over a throw, the two teams will try and decide the call. Ifa call cannot be made, there will be a re-throw. If disputescontinue, the captains may select two observers to officiate thegame.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">-----</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><B>TOURNAMENT SCHEDULE</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><B>WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 19, 1998</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">9:00-10:30 am	Registration/IDPhotos/Players' Packet</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">10:30-11:00 am	Meeting for All GutsPlayers</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">11:00-11:30 am	Team Captains'Meeting</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><B>COMPETITION (ROUND ROBIN FORMAT)</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">1st Round:	12:00 noon </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">2nd Round:	2:00 pm </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">3rd Round:	4:00 pm</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Extra Round:	6:00 pm (ifnecessary)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><B>THURSDAY, AUGUST 20, 1998</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><B>COMPETITION (ROUND ROBIN FORMAT)</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">4th Round:	10:00 am </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">5th Round:	12:00 noon </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">6th Round:	2:00 pm </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Extra Round:	4:00 pm (ifnecessary)</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><B>FRIDAY, AUGUST 21, 1998 </B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><B>COMPETITION (ROUND ROBIN FORMAT)</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">7th Round:	10:00 am </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><B>SEMI-FINALS BEGIN (DOUBLE ELIMINATION)</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">Semi-Finals:	12:00-6:00 pm </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><B>FINALS BEGIN: (2 OUT OF 3 GAMES)</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">FINALS:	6:00 pm </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">-----</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><B>HISTORY</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">	The granddaddy of all the disc sports,GUTS started in 1958 at the 1st Frisbee tournament ever, the IFT(International Frisbee Tournament). Originating in the UpperPeninsula of Michigan, very little is known on how this game gotstarted. The 5 Healy brothers, at a 4th of July picnic, introducedGUTS at the 1st IFT. But it is not clear who invented the game. Onething we are sure of, is that it's name comes from the intestinalfortitude you need to play the game.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">	During the 1950's &amp; 1960's the HealyBrothers dominated the sport until 1968 when a California team wonthe IFT. That started a boom in the sport. In the 1970's, 3-time IFTchampions Highland Avenue Aces, were the 1st team ever to practicefor a tournament. And from there the sport of GUTS took off. With 64teams and 10,000 screaming fans the IFT became the most attendedFrisbee tournament of its time. In 1969, the IFT was highlighted bythe attendance of Julius T. Nachazel, a professor at MichiganTechnological University. The coveted Nachazel Trophy has always beenpresented to the winner of the IFT and been a symbol of GUTSsupremacy.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">	In the 1970's and 1980's GUTS continued toflourish. Teams like the Library Bar, Motor City, Paul's Bar, AirAces, Cupola Bandits, and the Queen City Flyers dominated the GUTSscene. </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">	Then in the 1980's GUTS was introduced atthe WFDF Championships and the game went international. The USAcaptured the inagural tourney, with Sweden dominating the rest of the80's. In the 1990's the current WFDF GUTS Champions are from Republicof China-Taiwan. And other countries such as Japan, Germany, andEngland field strong GUTS teams.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">-----</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><B>PAST WFDF GUTS CHAMPIONSHIP RESULTS</B></FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><B>YEAR	<I>LOCATION</I>	CHAMPION</B></FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">1984	<I>Luzern, Switzerland</I>	USA(Windy City) </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">1986	<I>Colchester, England</I>	Sweden</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">1988	<I>Leuven, Belgium</I>	Sweden</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">1990	<I>Oslo, Norway</I>	USA </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">1992	<I>Utsunimoya, Japan</I>	USA</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">1994	<I>Colchester, England</I>	Republicof China </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">1996	<I>Gothernberg, Sweden</I>	Republicof China</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">1998	<I>Blaine, Minn USA</I>	Republic ofChina</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">-----</FONT></P><P><A HREF="http://www.sas.it.mtu.edu/~dkwalika/frisbee/one.htm"><FONT FACE="Helvetica">World'sday by day page</FONT></A></P><P><A HREF="http://www.sas.it.mtu.edu/~dkwalika/frisbee/"><FONT FACE="Helvetica">GUTSHome Page</FONT></A></P></BODY></HTML>
