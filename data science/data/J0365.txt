    series.</font></i> <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">Oh yea, we've all had
    bad days. But then there are bad days .....and there are BAD DAYS!!&nbsp; The Lads tales
    of gloom are always worth a grin and you might be forgiven for thinking 'well it could
    only happen to them', but despite the apparent years of practice, nothing could have
    prepared us for the havoc that reigned the other week.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial"><b><u>The Plot. <br>
    </u></b>The odds were always against us. For some strange reason, Fois was determined to
    do the ATS Coracle in mid Wales, the latest round of the Colway Formula Junior Challenge.
    The LRT van was missing it's gearbox after our recent Belgian disaster and was currently
    in the hands of Avanti Motorsport for it's 'birfday'. 'H' was in Greece and Big Kev was in
    Yorkshire. No van, no Service Crew. &nbsp; Incredibly, Fois managed to twist the arm of
    current BTRDA leader Steve French and duly hired not only his services for the day, but
    his van and trailer to boot!</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">Workloads meant that we all had to be back
    for Sunday, but as Fois kept pointing out, the compact rally programme meant a finish
    around 3.30pm and he promised that we'd be home for early evening. Against these stupid
    odds....we were off rallying.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial"><b><u>The Omen<br>
    </u></b>4.00am isn't a particularly pleasant time to get up, but with our 'new boy' at the
    wheel the crew could at least get some kip!&nbsp; Just ten miles into our journey,
    something happened that would change the course of the world. The Lads splattered a black
    Raven across the front of the van, blood dripping in true Hammer horror style. Damien
    wouldn't be pleased. </font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial"><b><u>The Rally<br>
    </u></b>Having just returned from Belgium and a gruelling 120 stage miles, we began to
    question the logic of travelling this far for five little tests totalling 28 miles, but
    here we were. Early morning rain gave way for the start but the forest stages were covered
    in cloud, visibility being reduced to only a few yards. Lack of vision and slippery tracks
    slowed the Lads to what seemed like walking pace, and we were therefore surprised to be
    holding 8th after the opening two stages. Others weren't quite so fortunate, Paul smith
    having rolled heavily, while Nipples Burton disappeared over the edge of stage 2 never to
    reappear!.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">Being a round of the Colway Championship,
    the Lads were obliged to suffer the Colway remoulds. At the midway service, the sidewalls
    of one rear tyre were distorted beyond belief having covered a mere 11 miles. On the spot
    Colway tyre man Hewey Lewis gave us the bad news, refusing to accept that there was a
    problem with his tyres and offered no replacement. Foisy let him know exactly what we
    thought, describing Colways in just four letters starting with 'w' and ending in 'ank'.
    LRT's resident tyre fitter Peter Collier at CG Tyres would have at least exchanged it, but
    for some strange reason this series is out of bounds for Mr Mophead and his crew. Now
    totally disillusioned, the Lads skipped the Colways and refitted their trusty Yokohama's
    for the remaining 3 stages, ending a so far uneventful day 6th overall. By 4.00pm we were
    on our way home....or so we thought!</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial"><b><u>The Minor Disaster<br>
    </u></b>A mere 10 miles out of Llandovery and approaching the wilds of the Brecon Beacons,
    the usually reliable French Motorsport Bedford CF coughed, spluttered, missed a bit, then
    died completely. Up above there were ravens circling.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">At least we had Frenchy with us. After a
    prod and a poke, Frenchy was sure the fault lay with the electronic ignition, which just
    happens to be integral with the distributor on his Rover V8 transplant. &nbsp; Where do
    you get a rover dizzy at 5.00pm on a Saturday, in the Black Mountains? With little option,
    Foisy and Le Nutter unloaded the rally car and went in search of who knows what. A few
    miles later they came across signs of a settlement comprising of two houses, a disused
    petrol station and an abandoned Range Rover. A Range Rover?...yep, they couldn't believe
    it either. Desperate situations call for desperate measures. Within moments the bonnet had
    been forced up, but before the offending item could be removed, the Lads had been spotted.
    It transpired that the owner wasn't in at the moment, and no he didn't want to sell it,
    and no he wouldn't be back for a while....he was currently in prison!. Anything petty we
    enquired?...no, two counts of murder!!&nbsp; Perhaps we didn't want his dizzy after all. </font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">We did come away with one top tip
    however...'you'd best go see Eik'.!! We didn't stay to ask whether Eik was a Mr, Mrs or
    what.&nbsp; Eik it turned out lived, like the rest of the population who weren't Soldiers,
    on a small farm miles from anywhere. After persuading him that we weren't Council Tax
    Inspectors, Eik suggested that &quot; you'd best go see Coldwell&quot; We'd just thought
    that we had the measure of the Locals, but nothing could have prepared us for the sight at
    Coldwells.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">Clearly not expecting visitors, Coldwell
    was unsuccessfully trying to shield from view, the remains of a mkIV Cortina gas axed in
    half, the upholstery still ablaze. Frenchy explained the story so far and that we were
    desperate for a Rover distributor. With a side step of no more than five feet, Coldwell
    produced the exact item complete with leads and pronounced &quot; you be meaning one of
    these then?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">Unbelievable but true, we now had what we
    wanted, but how much would we be prepared to pay? This was surely a sellers market, it was
    now 6.00pm we were stranded in the middle of the Brecons, and we were getting desperate.
    Coldwell considered carefully before pitching his offer.....&quot;give us a couple of quid
    then&quot;!! Frenchy and Fois fell about laughing before handing over a tenner, suggesting
    that he kept the change. A real business man was Coldwell.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">The new dizzy got fitted and an albeit
    weak spark was restored, but something was still mysteriously wrong. For another two hours
    the great man fiddled without success. Another 12 volt supply was connected to the coil
    and eventually the engine did fire, but only just. It was now 8.30 pm as we loaded up once
    more, ready to roll.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial"><b><u>The Slightly More Major Disaster.<br>
    </u></b>We'd gone another four miles when the miss fire got so bad, the engine finally
    stopped. We coasted the last hundred yards into a garage forecourt, we were going no
    further.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">Cellular telephone service hasn't reached
    this part of the world yet and despite having two hand portable white elephants with us,
    we hadn't spoken to anyone about our plight since Friday night. Our garage refuge was just
    about to close, but the only pub was open and so the Lads retired for a few pints and some
    desperate phone calls. Sennybridge did have one thing going for it, as well as a pub and a
    closed garage, there was a B&amp;B. It did have beds and a bathroom and, we discovered
    later, a brothel!</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">By 11.00pm we knew where we stood. Nobody
    was coming to get us, and if we couldn't sort something out, Sennybridge would be our new
    home! </font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial"><b><u>Day Two<br>
    </u></b>Frenchy explained to our patron, Madame Cyn, that we would have another go at
    fixing the van this morning. Unaware of his technical knowledge when it came to cars, she
    probed Steve deeper and deeper for the root cause of our breakdown. Finally, when she
    asked &quot; well is it missing or overheating then?&quot; we decided that it was time to
    leave. Another two hours of pointless prodding took place before making a team decision.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">We loaded everything that we could fit,
    plus three people, into the rally car and headed east. Van and trailer had been dumped at
    the scene and Frenchy would need to call in a few markers. </font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial"><b><u>Part II The Final Conflict.<br>
    </u></b>The Lads made it back to their Oxfordshire HQ late afternoon after dumping Frenchy
    on the M4 to rendezvous with the Essex contingent. What was to happen over the next two
    days would be enough to write a book.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">A 'mate' of Frenchy offered the use of a
    breakdown lorry big enough to handle the job, but on hearing that the trailer needed
    collecting too, would need to come along too since he had the HGV licence. Rather than
    waste another day, they would leave that night!. It was now 10.30pm on Sunday. Wales is
    298 miles from Essex.&nbsp; With Frenchy driving while his 'assistant' slept, they arrived
    at the scene at 3.00am. With only drug smugglers and microlites for company, they loaded
    up and left.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial"><b><u>Then the problems started.<br>
    </u></b>Firstly our professional recovery expert 'didn't feel well' and had to stop for an
    hour. </font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">Then they had a blowout! With no spare,
    another two hours were wasted while the National Tyres van was called out. It was now
    9.00am on Monday.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">They did eventually reach Essex at 2.00pm
    but it doesn't end there. After unloading the van and trailer, the truck suffers another
    blow out...whilst stationary!</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial"><b><u>The Epilogue.<br>
    </u></b>Two days later, Frenchy received a bill from his 'mate'.....£300 plus VAT.&nbsp;
    If the Lads ask YOU for a favour, don't be embarrassed, just say NO. We only wanted to
    borrow a van for the day, &quot; we'll be back by early evening &quot; This tale spanned
    three days and cost £800 excluding loss of earnings. That equates roughly to £28 per
    stage mile. Next year the Lads are going into Formula One. We reckon it might work out
    cheaper!</font><br>

    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">Flares, tie dye shirts, stackheel boots
    and the Rubettes. No....not another UK. 70's revival,....the Lads have just returned from
    Belgium! Stuck in a timewarp they may be but one thing that the phlegm's do know
    about.....and that's how to Rally!</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">LRT made their now annual pilgrimage to
    the tumbleweed town of Braine-le-Comte, which every year opens up it's Bars and hosts the
    latest round of the Belgian National Championship. Mixing it with the likes of Robert
    Droogmans, Marc Soulet and Jean-Marc Gaban were a dozen fellow Brits including Steve 'le
    nutter' French, Mick Hands and John Davie complete with his misfits.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">Stuart Turner at Allways Ferries does the
    deals and most of the legwork, duly booking the much favoured 11.30am Thursday
    Ramsgate-Dunkirk Sally Line crossing. We arrived at Ramsgate four up in the LRT Ducato
    with car and trailer in tow only to find us booked in as two people with a Ford Transit!</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">Fois turned on the charm, told the
    obligatory 'Mark Stanley/Herald of Free Enterprise' gag and we were on our way.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">After the mini heatwave at home the Lads
    were set to top up their tans and with Boddingtons at 98p a pint and Big Kev blowing some
    coin in the boats Casino, it looked like turning into one of those elusive good days. The
    only drawback we've found with the Dunkirk crossing is that the boat stops 100yards out
    and we all had to walk off with our suitcases over our heads!</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">Most of the Brits book into the same hotel
    at Nivelles-Sud, just off the motorway and only 12km from Braine-le-Comte, and has all the
    frills that you expect on the UK. events such as swimming pool, restaurants, shop and of
    course the bar! If your looking for a deal you can try the family rooms which sleep 4, if
    a couple of you don't mind a double. Ours worked out at £10.50 a night. Brekky was extra,
    but £5.00 for a jambon roll we figured was a little strong and so opted for a coffee down
    the town.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">Friday and Saturday are allocated for
    practice, the main action taking place all day Sunday. Last years recce proved to be tough
    on brakes even though we did take a Mazda 4x4 Turbo. Le Nutter had to cut short his
    practice last year when the brakes on his Datsun Pickup cried enough! This year we decided
    to thrash somebody else's car and duly hollered 'Eurodollar'. £92.00 was enough to secure
    a Fiesta CL for the duration, including collision damage, although as Big Kev pointed out
    later, it wasn't compulsory to claim on it!</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">Friday, 9.00am and crews assembled at Cafe
    Moderne in B-L-C High street to collect their roadbooks and copious stickers with which to
    transform any car into 'street racer'</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">In an attempt to reduce last years
    problems of speeding whilst practising, the organisers resorted to supplying crews with
    mini numbers to be displayed in the rear windows. Ours might have had 99 on it but we
    figured the Belgian plates made us look like locals! This years route was similar to last
    year, three loops of six stages between 6 and 12 km, all in all, about 110 stage miles all
    on closed public 'yellows'. </font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">With official practice ending about
    6.00pm, the evenings entertainment consisted of avoiding JD and the misfits, recollecting
    how the K-left tightened, who had what 90 right as 'cut', interspersed with plenty of
    &quot; huit bierre s'il vous plait &quot; Mick Hands and his knuckle heads soon proved
    themselves as professional drinkers, even donning square ended shoes to enable them to get
    nearer the bar, whilst their service crew mascot and Charlie Drake look-a-like, captured
    everything on Vid!!</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">In the last seven years that this event
    has been run, it's never rained.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">Friday and Saturday were both showery and
    words like 'wet' and 'mud' appearing on the pace notes made them look more like stages
    from the RAC. As ever, the Lads were prepared for the worst. We took ten tyres, 6 slicks,
    4 worn intermediates. We had factor 6 sunscreen, we had the aftersun. We had no wets. With
    little option, we scrutineered the car on inters and dumped it in the overnight parc ferme
    hoping for a bit of sun. Needless to say, Sunday dawned rainy but the signs of better
    weather were breaking as we left the Town Square to the million watts of music continually
    pumped out by Radio Contact, Begians answer to Hospital Radio.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">Being International timing, the road
    sections are timed from the start of one stage to the start of the next. It dosen't take
    you too long to realise that the quicker you go on the road, the more service time you
    get! We were a tad miffed to exit stage one and find that the usually reliable Big Kev
    &amp; 'H' were nowhere to be seen. We duly headed into SS2 only for the arrival control
    Marshall to explain, amid much arm-waving that our 'assistance' was 'mort'.&nbsp; Such is
    Foisy's confidence in our boys that his first comment was &quot; what the **** have they
    hit now? &quot; It transpired that the Ducato was firmly stuck in reverse and going
    nowhere, whilst we would have to spend the whole day without service crew, fuel or spares.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">After the first group of stages we located
    the van....exactly where we left it, in B-L-C High Street. At least we now had a central
    service point.&nbsp; Meanwhile, results were being thrust through the window in thick and
    fast fast. Rally organisers at home should really take note. All the start and finish
    controls are linked to the event H.Q., most have faxes and photocopiers. The results are
    so up to date that they had our times for the next two stages!! One thing that was
    becoming clear....Frenchy was cooking!.&nbsp; The dirt box escort was holding third
    overall ahead of Gabans 911 street dragster.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">The pace was now hotting up but the Lads
    progress was slowed on the first stage of the second loop with a puncture that cost us
    almost three minutes, no doubt caused by a clipped hole/kerb in an effort to cut the ever
    widening corners. Another puncture on the third stage forced us to run the rest of the
    stage on the rim, detouring though the town to our fixed point service, and take on three
    new slicks.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">The last stage of the second loop saw the
    demise of Steve French and co-pilot Blue Watch Baines. The escort had slid off on a not
    too tricky K right, Frenchy apparently losing it after a puncture 500 yards previously! So
    far the Nutter has yet to Finish overseas, when he does the Lads money is on a top three
    place.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">Our third loop proceeded without incident
    until the third stage, when the Uno suffered total electrical failure when in the arrival
    control queue. Suspicions were immediately drawn to the cut off switch but failure to
    bring improvement finally led us to the a broken earth strap but not before losing 20
    minutes of our lateness.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">Now running as tail end charlies, the Lads
    charged through the remaining three stages catching the same two cars on each stage. Such
    is Euro timing, you can't restart ahead of a car that started the previous stage before
    you!! Sussed it?? Fois couldn't!.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">Back in parc ferme the Lads had no time to
    dwell on their 100% record and an award for first in class R9. there was a small problem
    about getting the van mended. Whilst the rest partied the night away the lads were under
    the van, in the street, taking out the gearbox in the remote hope that something had
    simply jammed. If somebody dumped a transit outside your house and proceeded to litter the
    pavement with various bits of crap, you'd probably think of enough reasons to at least
    start a punch up. Such was the hospitality of our host, she even offered us a lead light,
    coffee and cakes and somewhere to stay the night!! The box finally dropped on the floor at
    11.30pm and we all returned to the hotel, 4-up in the Uno, hoping that the box might fix
    itself overnight. To cut a long story short, the box was un jammed and reassembled, albeit
    without 5th and reverse, our freindly neighbour offered to clean the gearbox oil off the
    road and we did make it back to the UK. early Thursday morning.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">History was made that weekend. For the
    first time ever, the lads won some prize money! Such are the big stakes on Internationals,
    even a class win can make you rich beyond your wildest dreams.....yep, two whole
    grand!!.....in phlegm francs!!!.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="+0" COLOR="#FF00FF" FACE="Arial">After deducting commission, taking into
    account the current exchange rate, we could probably buy....er....a packet of fags?</font></p>
