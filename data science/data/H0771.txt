Some scientists		disagree with 1., and assert that the mind is a direct product		of the biochemistry of the brain, but Berwick cannot be among		them: he himself takes a computational approach to language and		mind.<FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="#1">1</A></FONT> Others disagree with 2., and assert that there is a generic neural		network learning algorithm which the brain uses for every mental		process. But Berwick cannot be among them, either: he works in		a Chomskyan framework in which language is treated as a specialized		module, and presumably he does not believe that language is the		brain's <I>only</I> specialized module. As for 3., evolution, Berwick cannot be opposed		in principle to examining the phylogenetic basis of mental faculties,		since he himself has recently done just that for language.<FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="#2">2</A></FONT>		<P>There remains an issue of which mental processes are functional		adaptations, as opposed to by-products of adaptations or the result		of chance. It is unlikely that Ahouse and Berwick would deny that		one can <I>ever</I> say that some part of the mind is an adaptation; the idea that		stereo vision, fear, and sexual desire are adaptations to see		in depth, avoid danger, and beget children are as indispensible		and uncontroversial as the idea that the heart is an adaptation		to pump blood or the kidneys are adaptations to filter it. There		may be disagreements over whether <I>particular</I> mental faculties (such as probabilistic reasoning, grief, or		humor) are adaptations, and if so, what they are for, but such		arguments do not appear in Ahouse and Berwick's review.</P>		<P>The review becomes a bit less mysterious when we recognize that		their accusations are taken, often wording and all, from Richard		Lewontin. The review is the latest example of a conventional genre		in modern intellectual life: the all-out attack by Lewontin or		his collaborators (including Steven Rose, Stephen Jay Gould, and		Philip Kitcher) on attempts to connect psychology with standard		evolutionary biology. Since 1975, when Lewontin and others published		their &quot;Against Sociobiology&quot; manifesto claiming that such attempts		were politically reactionary and encouraged eugenics and Nazism,		the attacks have recycled the same accusations and tactics: fuzzy		scare words (&quot;atomism,&quot; &quot;reductionism,&quot; &quot;determinism&quot;), misreportings		and doctored quotations, shameless straw-manning, empty name-calling		(&quot;vulgar,&quot; &quot;pop&quot;), political smears, personal innuendo, and most		of all, the scientific snow job: seemingly damaging technical		findings that general readers are unlikely to know about and hence		unlikely to recognize as red herrings.<FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="#3">3</A> </FONT>		<P><I>How the Mind Works</I> (<I>HTMW)</I> tried to preempt this kind of attack by patiently raising and		refuting all the standard criticisms, both political and scientific.		But Ahouse and Berwick (hereafter A&amp;B) seem determined to discredit		the book by any means necessary, and so rather than engaging its		arguments, they have redoubled the use of shoddy tactics. As an		example of their standards of fairness, here is an excerpt in		which they try to show that I am ignorant of basic evolutionary		biology: </P>		<UL>			<P>Pinker asks, &quot;Why don't women give virgin birth?&quot; Certainly the			correct answer will not make particular reference to humans. Mammals,			including humans, just do not have this as a developmental option.			Put otherwise, it would take more than just a shift in selection			regimes to make humans start reproducing asexually. For these			reasons it is hollow bluster to talk about the selective advantage			of sex <I>in humans</I> if the traits we are discussing evolved and became established			long before the human lineage branched.</P>		</UL>		<P>This guy Pinker sure does sound naive! Unfortunately for the readers		of <I>Boston Review</I>, the &quot;hollow bluster&quot; is a sentence fragment that A&amp;B chopped		out of context:</P>		<UL>			<P>Why is there sex to begin with? . . . Biologically speaking, the			costs are damnable indeed, so why do almost all complex organisms			reproduce sexually? Why don't women give virgin birth to daughters			who are clones of themselves instead of wasting half their pregnancies			on sons who lack the machinery to make grandchildren and are nothing			but sperm donors? Why do people and other organisms swap out half			their genes for the genes of another member of the species, generating			variety in their offspring for variety's sake? (pp. 461-62). </P>		</UL>		<P>The discussion that follows also makes it clear that sex is puzzle		for all organisms; humans are presented just as an example.</P>		<P>This is not the first time that Berwick has been caught doctoring		a quotation in these pages; he also did it in his dismissive review		of Richard Dawkins's fine book <I>Climbing Mount Improbable</I>.<FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="#4">4</A></FONT> Nor is it the last time. As we shall see, A&amp;B repeatedly fabricate		the content of <I>HTMW</I> and misinform their readers about the technical results they		marshal to criticize it.</P>		<P><I>Distortion 1: I uncritically believe that all traits are adaptations.</I> </P>		<P>Let's compare the accusations with what I wrote: </P>		<UL>			<P>A&amp;B: &quot;In evolutionary terms, every trait we examine is an admixture			of physical constraints, natural selection and chance with history.			These features are constitutive, not optional. Pinker presents			a mutually exclusive conception pitting these factors against			each other.&quot;</P>			<P><I>HTMW:</I> &quot;Natural selection should not be pitted against developmental,			genetic, or phylogenetic constraints, as if the more important			one of them is, the less important the others are&quot; (p. 169). &quot;Organisms			can be understood only as interactions among adaptations, by-products			of adaptations, and noise&quot; (p. 174). </P>			<P>A&amp;B: &quot;All traits do not lead to a selective advantage, the origin			of traits and their maintenance do not demand the same selectionist			account. Pinker never embraces this distinction as a vivid part			of his adaptationism.&quot; </P>			<P><I>HTMW</I> on all traits leading to selective advantage: &quot;The mind is an			adaptation designed by natural selection, but that does not mean			that everything we think, feel, and do is biologically adaptive			(p. 23).&quot; &quot;The major faculties of the mind . . . show the handiwork			of selection. That does not mean that every aspect of the mind			is adaptive&quot; (p. 174). &quot;Some readers may be surprised to learn			that after seven chapters of reverse-engineering the major parts			of the mind, I will conclude by arguing that some of the activities			we consider most profound are nonadaptive by-products&quot; (p. 525).			</P>			<P><I>HTMW</I> on origin versus maintenance: &quot;Many organs that we see today			have maintained their original function. . . . Others changed			their function. . . . [Sometimes] before an organ was selected			to assume its current form, it was adapted for something else&quot;			(p. 170). </P>		</UL>		<P><I>Distortion 2: I am an atomist and a genetic reductionist, reducing		every behavior to a simple trait, and then, in a straight line,		to a single gene.</I> </P>		<P>This is exactly backwards. Behavior reduced to a single trait?</P>		<UL>			<P>[The generator of behavior is] the package of information-processing			and goal-pursuing mechanisms called the mind.[ . . . ]Any particular			deed done today is the effect of dozens of causes. Behavior is			the outcome of an internal struggle among many mental modules,			and it is played out on the chessboard of opportunities and constraints			defined by other people's behavior. (p. 42)</P>			<P>The on-board computers of social organisms, especially of humans,			should run sophisticated programs that assess the opportunities			and risks at hand and compete or cooperate accordingly. (p. 429)			<BR>			</P>		</UL>		<P>Behavioral traits reduced to single genes? </P>		<UL>			<P>The organization of our mental modules comes from our genetic			program, but that does not mean that there is a gene for every			trait (p. 23). </P>			<P>An emphasis on innate design should not, by the way, be confused			with the search for &quot;a gene for&quot; this or that mental organ. [			. . . ]Complex mental organs, like complex physical organs, surely			are built by complex genetic recipes, with many genes cooperating			in as yet unfathomable ways (pp. 34-35).</P>			<P>Neither adultery nor any other behavior can be in our genes (p.			42). </P>		</UL>		<P>A&amp;B's specific charges are equally backwards. They charge, &quot;A		behavior like 'incest avoidance' gets boiled down to a simple		heritable trait.&quot; I wrote the opposite: &quot;Incest avoidance showcases		the complicated software engineering behind our emotions for other		people&quot; (p. 456). A particularly blatant caricature comes in an		attempt to educate us on birth order: </P>		<UL>			<P>Birth order is a clear example of environment, not inheritance,			as a prime mover (later-born children could <I>not</I> be expected on average to receive more gullibility genes from			their parents). With the wind of adaptationism filling his sails,			Pinker must claim that the whole behavioral repertoire response			[sic] of first-borns or the inverse behavior of later-borns is			all selected for. </P>		</UL>		<P><I>Must</I> claim? Here is what I do claim:</P>		<UL>			<P>[Children] should calculate how to make the best of the hand that			nature dealt them and of the dynamics of the poker game they were			born into. The historian Frank Sulloway has argued that the elusive			nongenetic component of personality is a set of strategies to			compete with siblings for parental investment, and that is why			children in the same family are so different. Each child develops			in a different family ecology and forms a different plan for getting			out of childhood alive. (p. 453)</P>		</UL>		<P>All children being equipped with strategies for competing with		siblings is very different from parents' directing gullibility		genes to later-borns. </P>		<P>Oddly enough, A&amp;B write as if they themselves believe that genetic		atomism and determinism are required by the theory of evolution:		</P>		<UL>			<P>If genes are to serve as accurate bookkeeping chits for maximizing			fitness, all the way to love's blushes, then the dotted lines			from genes to behaviors <I>must</I> run straight and true. Any deviation, any non-determinism or			interaction between and among the stepping-stones, and our explanatory			hold slips .[emphasis added] (p. 38)</P>		</UL>		<P>Again, must? It is a commonplace of evolutionary biology that		genes are selected because of their <I>probabilistic</I> effects: a gene &quot;for&quot; a trait is a gene that, in comparison with		rival alleles, and averaged over environments and over the other		genes it appears with, increases the probability that the trait		will appear. As A&amp;B acknowledge later in the review, &quot;Biologists		have long said a lot about evolution without any detailed knowledge		of the steps from genotype to phenotype. All you need are statistical		<I>correlations</I> to move from gene to phenotype without a full causal story.&quot;		Indeed they have. But A&amp;B have just refuted their own claim that		&quot;the dotted lines from gene to behavior must run straight and		true&quot;! </P>		<P><I>Distortion 3: HTMW is just story-telling, and presents no basis		for evaluating its hypotheses about the biological function of		mental faculties.</I> </P>		<UL>			<P>A&amp;B: Pinker knows that we can always replace one adaptive story			by another or add more useful modules as required, but offers			us no way to reasonably refrain from doing so.</P>		</UL>		<P>In fact I &quot;know&quot; no such thing, do &quot;offer us&quot; a way, and do &quot;refrain		from doing so&quot; myself.</P>		<P>First, I present standard criteria in biology for evaluating hypotheses		about adaptive function. Obviously such criteria must exist. As		Ernst Mayr, one of the century's seminal evolutionary biologists,		has noted, &quot;The adaptationist question, 'What is the function		of a given structure or organ?' has been for centuries the basis		of every advance in physiology. If it had not been for the adaptationist		program, we probably would still not yet know the functions of		thymus, spleen, pituitary, and pineal. Harvey's question 'Why		are there valves in the veins?' was a major stepping stone in		his discovery of the circulation of blood.&quot;</P>		<P>I detail these criteria right from the first chapter (pp. 36-40;		also 155-74, 524-26). A good adaptationist explanation specifies		a goal relevant to survival or reproduction, the causal structure		of the organism's environment, and the engineering designs suited		to attain that goal in that environment. It then requires empirical		data showing that the trait in question uncannily meets the engineering		specs, showing signs of complexity, effectiveness, and specialization		in solving the assigned problem, especially in comparison with		alternative designs that are biologically possible for that kind		of organism.</P>		<P>These criteria are applied throughout. Frequent comparisons with		other primates and mammals show that alternatives to what we find		in humans, such as lacking language, living in solitude, or mating		indiscriminately, are developmentally possible (thus A&amp;B's logical		possibility in which genetic variation for such traits is &quot;meager&quot;		can be dismissed). And <I>HTMW</I> cites close to 300 empirical reports or literature reviews in		evaluating specific hypotheses.</P>		<P>A&amp;B conceal this from the reader. For example, they write, &quot;Are		wicked step-parents and parent-child conflict the natural outcome		of genetic-payoff investment calculations? <I>HTMW</I> relies on readers' willingness to supply examples from their		own lives . . .&quot; No, <I>HTMW</I> relies on cross-cultural and ethnographic surveys, studies of		of stepparents in the United States, and national statistics on		child abuse and filicide (pp. 433-34). </P>		<P>Here is a particularly unfortunate example: </P>		<UL>			<P>A&amp;B: &quot;There are many stories we tell ourselves. <I>HTMW</I> presents one that allows Pinker to . . . rationalize his particular			view of relationships. Read as autobiography this may provide			some insight, but as storytelling there are certainly more interesting			organizing myths.&quot; </P>		</UL>		<P>A&amp;B do not explain my personal views of relationships, my autobiographical		history, or how they claim to know them; their innuendo is another		attempt to hide the empirical content of <I>HTMW</I>. The &quot;story&quot; in question is the theory of sexual selection and		parental investment, and it is a clear counterexample to the claim		that adaptationist hypotheses are sterile and unfalsifiable post		hoc stories. Darwin first noticed an asymmetry in mating in much		of the animal kingdom: males compete, females choose. In the 1960s		and 1970s George Williams, John Maynard Smith, and Robert Trivers		provided an elegant explanation in terms of parental investment:		whichever sex invests more in offspring becomes a limiting resource		for the other, and so the less-investing sex competes, the greater-investing		sex chooses. In 1979 Donald Symons amassed a vast set of data		on human sexuality that supported this theory, refuted competing		adaptationist hypotheses, and made many new predictions about		promiscuity, jealousy, mate selection, and physical attractiveness.		In the 1980s and 1990s these predictions were tested in laboratory		experiments, sociological data, <I>in vivo</I> field studies, surveys of the ethnographic literature, and cross-cultural		surveys involving tens of thousands of people in thirty-seven		cultures<I>-</I>and largely confirmed (pp. 460-93). A&amp;B make no mention of these		empirical tests, preferring snide, <I>ad hominem</I> remarks.</P>		<P>Finally, <I>HTMW</I> refutes A&amp;B's cliche that &quot;in adaptationist history/fictions		that Pinker fancies there is no end to plausible story telling		. . . we can always replace one adaptive story by another or add		more modules as required, but [Pinker] offers us no way to reasonably		refrain from doing so.&quot; A&amp;B do not mention that a major conclusion		of <I>HTMW</I> is that many of the most momentous human activities do <I>not</I> meet the criteria for adaptations, including written language,		dreams, science, mathematics, music, art, religion, philosophy,		and most narrative (pp. 174, 302-06, 340-42, and all of Chapter		8).<FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="#5">5</A></FONT>		<P><B><FONT FACE="Helvetica,arial" SIZE="2">Technical Issues</FONT></B></P>		<P><I><FONT FACE="Helvetica,arial" SIZE="2">1. Vision</FONT><ONT SIZE="2">. </FONT>In the chapter on vision, I suggest that the visual system uses		a local, topographic, viewer-centered representation of visible		surfaces and their depths, which David Marr called a &quot;2H-D sketch&quot;		and which contemporary researchers have modified into what they		call a &quot;visual surface representation&quot; (pp. 256-61). A&amp;B claim		that &quot;practically no one&quot; believes in it anymore. That is false.		Recent overviews by leading perception psychologists such as Berkeley's		Stephen Palmer and Harvard's Ken Nakayama rely on a modified 2H-D		sketch; <I>HTMW</I>'s discussion was based on a 1995 synthesis by Nakayama whose		title tells a story: &quot;Visual surface representation: A critical		link between lower-level and higher-level vision.&quot; A&amp;B cite &quot;scientists		at MIT&quot; as disproving the visual-surface representation; when		I showed two of them A&amp;B's claim, the responses were: &quot;To say		'no one believes in it' sounds overly strong. My sense is that		surfaces of this sort remain quite popular, both in computer vision		and in human vision,&quot; and &quot;The claim you cite below is very misleading		and exaggerated!&quot;<FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="#6">6</A></FONT>		<P><I><FONT SIZE="2">2. Behavioral Genetics</FONT><ONT SIZE="2">.</FONT> I report a near-consensus among human behavioral geneticists:		that &quot;much of the variation in personality<I>-</I>about fifty percent<I>-</I>has genetic causes.&quot; A&amp;B assert that this naively confuses causation		with correlation. I agree that A&amp;B's definition of heritability<I>-</I>&quot;the tendency of offspring to resemble their parents&quot;<I>-</I>does not show that a trait is genetically influenced. But A&amp;B		have caricatured an entire field. The claim that variation in		adult personality has substantial genetic causes is based on far		more than that: that identical twins are more similar than fraternal		twins, that biological siblings are more similar than adopted		siblings, that these correlations are much the same whether the		siblings are reared together or apart, that they remain even after		one statistically controls for every possible contaminating factor		ever proposed (including shared placentas), that these findings		replicate across labs, decades, and countries, and that in several		recent studies the variation has been tied to identifiable genes		for neurotransmitters or their receptors or transpoters.<FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="#7">7</A></FONT>		<P>Perhaps fearful that they cannot make the charge stick, A&amp;B turn		to other tactics. First, guilt-by-association: they triumphantly		refute a silly nine-year-old quotation about IQ from a newspaper		reporter. Second, misreporting: they write that I &quot;evidently&quot;		rely on Thomas Bouchard's studies of &quot;25&quot; monozygotic twins. In		fact Bouchard and his collaborators have studied over <I>1200</I> monozygotic twins (112 of them raised apart), and I cite reviews		of converging studies of thousands of twins and adoptees conducted		by independent teams in half a dozen countries. And finally, the		political card: &quot;Pinker's assertion is simply the authority of		modern science pressed into the service of speculative fictions<I>-</I>truly biology as ideology.&quot; The latter is another trope from Lewontin,		summarizing his theory that the current attention to DNA by molecular		biologists is an attempt to root social problems in individual		failings and thus preserve the status quo.<FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="#8">8 </A></FONT>		<P><I>3. Population genetics</I>. A&amp;B claim that <I>HTMW</I> falters by not presenting calculations from population genetics,		the mathematical modeling of genetic change in evolution:</P>		<UL>			<P><I>HTMW</I> contains nothing--literally not one thing<I>- </I>resembling either evolutionary modeling, explicit fitness calculations,			or the basics of population or behavioral genetics.</P>		</UL>		<P>This is false. <I>HTMW</I> was written for a wide audience and does not present equations		or proofs, but I explain many results from the explicit modeling		of evolution. These include the fundamental theorem of population		genetics (p. 163), models of the rate of evolution (pp. 163-64,		205), reconstruction of phylogeny through DNA comparisons (pp.		202-05), Hamilton's models of kin selection (pp. 398-401, 429-30),		Trivers's formulation of reciprocal altruism (pp. 402-03, 502-04),		Trivers's calculations on parental investment (pp. 440-42, 463-64),		models of the genetic costs of incest (pp. 456-58), Grafen's modeling		of sexual selection (pp. 500-01), Maynard Smith &amp; Price's game-theoretic		analysis of conflict (pp. 494-95), the game-theoretic analyses		of bargains, threats, and promises by Schelling, Frank, and Hirshleifer		(pp. 409-12), Rogers's calculations of age- and sex-specific discounting		of the future (p. 498), Tooby &amp; Cosmides's calculations on coalitional		aggression (p. 514), and computer simulations of the evolution		of neural networks (pp. 177-79), eyes (p. 164), and strategies		of cooperation (pp. 503-04). Data on fitness are cited in discussions		of children's age-specific value to parents (p. 452), incest (p.		456), male parental investment (p. 469), dominance (p. 495), and		aggression (p. 510), among others. Behavioral genetics is discussed		in pages 20-21, 448-449, and elsewhere.</P>		<P>It is true that I do not back up every hypothesis with mathematical		models of changing gene frequencies, but then neither do biologists		when they study the evolutionary function of the stomach or the		eye. Pointedly, neither does Berwick himself in his own foray		into evolutionary psychology, in which he confidently states that		Chomsky's latest grammatical theory supports a saltationist account		of the evolution of language.<FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="#9">9</A></FONT>		<P>A&amp;B claim to know of specific results from population genetics		that undermine <I>HTMW</I>. First they say that population genetics casts strong doubt on		whether adaptations can easily evolve: if genes combine in complex		ways to determine phenotypes, then the fittest phenotype may not		evolve. Of course, fit phenotypes <I>do</I> evolve. Living things have improbable, intricately engineered		parts: eyes and wings and lungs and immune systems and leaves		and DNA repair and the other complex machinery that lets plants		and animals stay alive. So the fact that some combinations of		genes don't evolve into adapted phenotypes simply shows that organisms		are not restricted to those combinations of genes over the evolutionary		long run. A&amp;B concede the point late in their review: </P>		<UL>			<P>In recent conversation, James Crow, our foremost population geneticist,			has insisted to us that if there were not <I>some</I> trait independence, evolution would grind to a halt, because			any change would change all the traits in an organism and so nothing			of lasting substance could be built. There is surely something			to this. </P>		</UL>		<P>There surely is, but they did not have to go to &quot;our foremost		population geneticist&quot; to learn it. They could have asked me<I>-</I>or any biologist who treats population genetics as a tool to be		applied with care and common sense, rather than as a weapon with		which to beat opponents. </P>		<P>A&amp;B's specific charge is that I am unaware of a seldom-cited twenty-year-old		paper reporting a mathematical model in which &quot;the entire kin-selection-		maximize fitness [sic] edifice collapses.&quot; Since kin selection<I>-</I>the evolution of traits that benefit relatives because of their		shared genes<I>-</I>is a cornerstone of the modern evolutionary analysis of social		relations, this would appear to be a major flaw. But A&amp;B's reporting		is highly distorted.<FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="#10">10</A></FONT>< HREF="#10"> </A></P>		<P>First of all, A&amp;B are incorrect in saying that &quot;Hamilton's original		calculation was done only for <I>haploid-diploid</I> organisms where sisters have only half the usual number of chromosomes;		this makes the bookkeeping easy, allowing us to conflate <I>genes</I> and <I>genotypes</I>.&quot; Or as Berwick put it in his other review of <I>HTMW</I> in the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>, the &quot;cost-benefit arithmetic doesn't balance the genetic books		properly, unless you assume people are either ants or bees.&quot; In		fact Hamilton published his results in two classic papers: the		first analyzed the standard diploid case, the second extended		it to the haplodiploid social insects.</P>		<P>Second, the paper by Feldman and Cavalli-Sforza does <I>not</I> say that in their interpretation, the entire edifice of kin selection		&quot;collapses.&quot; It says only that Hamilton's original results are		&quot;model-dependent&quot;<I>-</I>a very different claim. Apparently A&amp;B are unaware that in the		ensuing two decades many mathematical biologists have developed		plausible models in which kin-directed altruism can be proven		to evolve, and without the bizarre parameter values that Feldman		&amp; Cavalli-Sforza deduced.<FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="#11">11</A></FONT>		<P>There is a more general error in A&amp;B's referring to population		genetics as &quot;the auto mechanics of evolution&quot; and their implication		that those who do not use it at every step are courting elementary		errors. Models in population genetics are, by necessity, grossly		simplified thought experiments about evolution over the short		term. A typical model might posit two genes (compared to our 75,000),		each coming in two or three alleles (compared to the astronomical		numbers possible over the long term), with their interactions		fixed (though the interactions themselves may change over the		long term), and model the entire environment and entire phenotype		as a single coefficient. As in economics, sophisticated mathematical		models may be restricted to artificial toy worlds and have little		connection to reality. One reformed population geneticist, a collaborator		of Feldman's, has recently written: </P>		<P>It seems, thus, that the repeated failure to apply empirically		the results of population genetic models to non-trivial evolutionary		problems<FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="#12">12</A></FONT>< HREF="#12"> </A>stems from an attempt to predict one process (say, long-term evolution)		on the basis of a model, corresponding to another process (say,		short-term evolution). This long-persisting attempt was based		on the postulate, tacitly accepted by most in the field (the author		of this note included), that at least qualitatively, the behaviour		of the long-term process can be fully understood by extrapolation		of the analytically well-defined short-term process. We see that		this postulate is mathematically wrong.<FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="#13">13</A></FONT>		<P>No doubt there is much to criticize in <I>HTMW</I>. But bystanders have a right to an accurate characterization		of the book's content and of the relevant technical results. Readers		of Ahouse and Berwick's review and of similar attacks on evolutionary		psychology should ask: if the approach were really that empty,		would these critics need to resort to so many misreportings, caricatures,		and other questionable tactics?</P>		<P><FONT SIZE="1">		<HR NOSHADE SIZE="1">		</FONT>		<P><FONT SIZE="1"><A NAME="1"></A>1</FONT> Robert C.
