<h1>Microbial Genomes: An Information Base for 21st Century Microbiology</h1>


Scientists, beginning to appreciate the role of microbial life in global climate processes, can expect insights about both the biological underpinnings of climate change and the microbial role in the overall "metabolism" of earth. The implications are immense for basic science and for near-term applications.
<P> 
These are extraordinary times for microbiology and biological science in general. For a growing set of microorganisms, microbiology can now proceed from a complete knowledge of an organism's genomic blueprint to its consequent activities and behaviors. Such a breakthrough requires, at a minimum, new thinking about how to ask questions regarding the relationship of genomic information and biological properties and behaviors. From a long and very successful history of "reductionist" science exploiting ever more powerful ways of dissecting cells and systems into their more and more fundamental components, we have reached the limit. We can now look at how the "parts" come together in ways that challenge basic science and offer concrete applications in a range of issues affecting, for example, water quality, environmental remediation, and medicine.
<P> A complete genome is the ultimate "parts list" for an organism. Until now, 
  no alternative existed but to dissect an organism, its systems, and its component 
  parts to the simplest elements. With all these parts in hand as a result of 
  complete genome sequencing, we now have no alternative but to reverse direction. 
  Already, nearly 3 dozen complete microbial genomes have been sequenced, 11 of 
  them supported by the Microbial Genome Program (MGP) of the U.S. Department 
  of Energy (DOE). More than 2 dozen have been published in the last 4 years, 
  and the rate of reported new genomes is increasing rapidly. [For a current listing, 
  see <a href="http://www.tigr.org/tdb/mdb/mdb.html">http://www.tigr.org/tdb/mdb/mdb.html</a>] 
  Perhaps as many as 50 genomes will be completed by the end of this century. 
<P>
Today, the MGP is generating complete genomic sequence information on a phylogenetically diverse set of microbes, enabling scientists to make side-by-side sequence comparisons of microorganisms with similar physiological attributes and varying degrees of evolutionary relatedness. The information is stored, documented, shared, and reexamined through a series of database and communication technologies, rendering this an international collaborative effort. The MGP's most profound impact may be nothing less than the reversal of the traditional paradigm of biological science, which has relied on observations of behavior and inheritance to make deductions about a single organism's genetic controls.
<P>
The possible implications and uses of this information are staggering. Microbes are thought to make up more than 60% of the earth's biomass (and some estimates are higher still).<sup>1</sup> They have survived and evolved on earth for over 3.7 billion years and have been found in every environment, thriving in extremes of heat, cold, radiation, pressure, salt, acidity, and darkness, often where no other forms of life are found and where nutrients come only from inorganic matter.<sup>2</sup> Less than 1% of all microbial species have been described<sup>3,4</sup> because they are difficult to grow in the lab. (Most are not responsible for diseases in humans, animals, or plants, which makes them functionally invisible to investigations.) 
<P>
The diversity and range of environmental adaptations means that microbes long ago "solved" many problems for which scientists are still actively seeking solutions. By studying and understanding a diverse group of microbes on the genomic level, investigators are nearing solutions for challenges in medicine, agriculture, industrial processes, energy production and use, and environmental and waste cleanup. Moreover, scientists are beginning to appreciate the role of microbial life in global climate processes and are expecting insights into both the biological underpinnings of climate change and the microbial role in the overall "metabolism" of earth. These capabilities soon can be added to long-known uses of microbes in the brewing, baking, dairy, and other industries. 
<P>
<B>Microbial Candidates for Sequencing</B><BR>

The MGP is a spin-off of the Human Genome Project, initiated by the Department of Energy (DOE) in 1986 and now coordinated by DOE and the NIH National Human Genome Research Institute. Since DOE's microbial program originated in 1994, it has focused on sequencing the entire genomes of nonpathogenic microbes of potential use to DOE. These include microbes of environmental or energy relevance, phylogenetic relevance, and potential commercial importance and application. The microbes chosen for genomic sequencing have been selected with broad input from the scientific community. DOE has convened a series of small workshops of experts from the fields of sequencing, microbiology, and environmental sciences to suggest and prioritize candidates for microbial sequencing. The most recent of these workshops was held November 1, 1999, to discuss cellulose-degrading microbes.
<P>
The cellulose-degrading microbes could be of considerable use to DOE in addressing the large biomass-utilization problems it faces. These challenges are rooted in the fact that cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer on earth, is used in virtually every form of plant life. Most animals do not possess the necessary enzymes to break down cellulose (enzymes are frequently "borrowed," along with the bacteria that supply them, e.g., the rumen of a cow's stomach and the hindgut of termites).      
<P>
To date, many more suitable microbial species have been suggested for sequencing than could be undertaken. The broad criteria for selecting microbes to be sequenced under MGP's aegis have included:
<ul>
    <LI>nonpathogenicity to humans;
     
    <LI>environmental relevance, i.e., energy production, waste remediation, biotechnological interest, or industrial processes;
      
    <LI>reasonably small genome (as a practical matter, less than 10 million base pairs, although this is expanding as sequencing technologies improve);
      
    <LI>genetic tractability, so that opportunities for genetic engineering to address DOE challenges can be exploited;
      
    <LI>scientific interest, such as phylogenetic position in evolutionary trees; and
      
    <LI>culturability, so that ample and pure genomic DNA can be readily obtained.
      </ul>
<B>Early Microbial Sequencing</b>

The DOE MGP funded four peer-reviewed projects from its first solicitation in 1995. Following the demonstration by The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) that a complete bacterial genome could be sequenced (<I>Haemophilus influenzae</i>, 1995<sup>5</sup>), TIGR, together with the University of Illinois, was awarded a 3-year cooperative agreement (since renewed) to fully sequence the genomes of <I>Methanococcus jannaschii</i> and other appropriate microorganisms. 
    
<I>M. jannaschii</i> is an extreme thermophile (i.e., an organism that grows at a high temperature) that was isolated at the base of a thermal vent at a depth of 8000 feet off the coast of Baja California. It possesses a small (1.66 million base-pair) genome, is barophilic (lives at high pressures), and produces methane. Its optimum growth temperature is 90 C (about 190 F), and it is strictly anaerobic and autotrophic. (That is, it existed in an oxygen-free environment and required only carbon dioxide or carbonates as a source of carbon and a simple inorganic nitrogen compound for metabolic synthesis.) Astonishingly, when its entire DNA sequence was determined, it was found that about 65% of its putative genes were unrelated to any genes previously discovered, representing an exciting area for future investigation.<sup>6</sup> 
<P>
Cooperative agreements also were signed with Genome Therapeutics Corporation to sequence the DNA of <I>Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum</i>; with the University of Utah to sequence the DNA of Pyrococcus furiosus; and with Recombinant BioCatalysis, Inc. (now Diversa Corporation) to sequence the DNA of <I>Aquifex aeolicus VF5</i>. All of these are very high temperature archaea, the microbes thought to be the oldest on earth.
<P>
<I>A. aeolicus VF5</i> is a hyperthermophilic marine bacterium that represents the deepest-branching extant bacterial lineage. Its DNA sequence has been completed.<sup>7</sup> <I>P. furiosus</i> is a marine heterotrophic hyperthermophile with an optimum growth temperature of 100<sup> </sup>C and a 2 million base-pair genome. Since its discovery in the mid-1980s, <I>P. furiosus</i> has become the research model for hyperthermophily. Its DNA sequence also is now complete. <I>M. thermoautotrophicum</i>, found in sewage sludge, grows optimally at 65<sup> </sup>C (about 150<sup> </sup>F) and has a genome size of about 1.7 million base pairs. Much of the biochemistry of the bioconversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to CH<sub>4</sub> is based on this anaerobic autotrophic archaeon. It provides a model for methanogenesis, the biological production of methane, itself a product of the decomposition of organic matter and carbonization of coal as well as the flammable component of natural gas. The complete sequence of <I>M. thermoautotrophicum</i> was published at the end of 1997.<sup>8</sup> 
   <P>
A second genome completed by Genome Therapeutics Corp is that of <I>Clostridium acetobutylicum</i>, which is capable of making and secreting the solvent acetone. <I>C. actobutylicum</i> also played a part in recent history; it is the microbe that Chaim Weizmann used to furnish acetone (critical at that time to the manufacture of artillery ammunition) to the British war effort in World War I. In recognition and gratitude for his contributions, the British government inquired of Weizmann what title or reward they could bestow. Weizmann wasn't interested in any personal recognition but did ask for help with the establishment of a homeland for the Jewish people in Palestine. The result was the Balfour Declaration of 1917, formally committing Britain to such a homeland, which eventually became the State of Israel in 1948 (with Weizmann as its first president).<sup>9</sup> 
    <P>
Although DOE did not intend at first to focus the MGP on archaea, when the early opportunity arose to sequence the genomes of three high-temperature archaea, the decision was an easy one. Sequencing the DNA of these microbes would enable searches for genetic commonality among the three thermophiles and with methanogens from divergent branches on the phylogenetic tree. A fortuitous by-product of these initial sequencing projects was the confirmation that the "tree of life" indeed had three branches, a hypothesis first advanced nearly 20 years ago by Carl Woese of the University of Illinois.<sup>10,11</sup> Although this hypothesis was not given much credence at first, <I>M. jannaschii</i>'s definitive sequence confirmed its independent location on the tree consistent with three branches (rather than the previously believed five branches).  
<P>
The complete DNA sequence of <I>M. jannaschii</i> was determined by TIGR in December 1995. At about the same time, TIGR completed the sequence of <I>Mycoplasma genitalium</i>, a eubacterium thought to have the smallest genome (580,000 base pairs) of any free-living bacterium, making it a model for a minimal set of genes sufficient for free-living existence.<sup>12</sup> 
<P>
<B>Sequencing Other Microbes</b>
<BR>
TIGR also has sequenced <I>Archaeoglobus fulgidis</i>, a microbe isolated from an oil well where it was spoiling the crude by adding sulfur, thus making the crude harder to purify for commercial use.<sup>13</sup> The most recent microbial sequence completed by TIGR (with DOE support) is the genome of <I>Deinococcus radiodurans</i>, an amazing microbe that can survive 1.5 million rads of radiation, 3000 times the lethal dose to humans.<sup>14</sup> Additionally, Michael Daly at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland, has (in collaboration with TIGR) genetically engineered <I>D. radiodurans</i> to partially degrade toluene<sup>15</sup> and to transform divalent mercury (Hg[II]) to a less toxic form. This achievement has established both the ability to engineer additional functions into the microbe and the persistence of added functionality when the host organism is exposed to radiation.<sup>16</sup> The astonishing DNA repair capacities of this organism, as well as the feasibility of genetically modifying it, are of obvious interest to DOE in the context of cleaning up radioactive wastes. 
<P> The target date is 2003 for completing the 3.5 billion base-pair human sequence, 
  with a useful working draft expected by the spring of 2000. In contrast to this 
  huge undertaking, the genomes of many, much-smaller microbes can be completely 
  sequenced in only months using current technology. This rate will surely increase 
  with newer technologies. Only a few years ago, most scientists could not have 
  imagined gaining access to the complete genetic sequence of more than a few 
  microbes. Today, the complete genomic sequences of 24 microbes (<a href="http://www.tigr.org/tdb/tdb.html">http://www.tigr.org/tdb/tdb.html</a>), 
  in addition to those of a yeast and many viruses, are available in public databases 
  and are being used by academic, medical, and industrial scientists. By the end 
  of 1999, an additional 12 or so microbial genomes will add to the number of 
  complete microbial sequences available for unrestricted scientific investigation. 
<P>
All DNA sequence data generated in the DOE MGP is made publicly available as expeditiously as possible, an essential characteristic of both the MGP and the Human Genome Project. These data add a new dimension to the understanding and exploitation of microbial diversity and give scientists new insights into the origins of life on earth and the genetic basis for cell structure and function in various environments.
<P>
The private sector also has begun to explore sequencing of microbial genomes as a tool to more rapidly identify target genes for commercialization as enzymes or, in the case of some human pathogens, as therapeutic drug targets. Unfortunately, these sequences are not always made public.
<P>
As the complete genomic sequences of microbes are determined, their DNA sequences also are analyzed or annotated to identify all the potential genes encoded in their DNA and to get clues about their potential functions. This annotation of the microbial genomes is a critical and fascinating part of the MGP. Repeatedly, investigators are finding that about 35% of predicted genes identified in newly sequenced microbial genomes are unrelated to any genes that have previously been discovered, including those in the genomes of very recently sequenced microbes. Such new genes represent exciting opportunities for future basic research and potential sources of biological resources to be examined for future use. A source of consternation at the moment is that, despite the increasing number of complete sequences available, this 35% number for previously unknown genes is not decreasing. This fact may underscore how little we really know about microbial genomes and their adaptive "skills."
<P>
<B>Early Sequencing Results</b><br>

One of the surprises emerging from a number of microbial sequences is the presence of genetic segments, not just single genes but entire blocks of genes that appear to have been acquired during microbial evolution from other microbes in very distant parts of the Woese "tree of life." Remarkably, the complete genome sequence of <I>Thermotoga maritima</i>, a hyperthermophilic bacterium isolated from a volcanic island off Sicily, seems to have acquired a quarter of its genome from an archaeon ostensibly separated by about a billion years of evolution.<sup>17</sup> This and other examples of "lateral gene transfer" present an exciting challenge to our understanding of microbial evolution. At present, we do not know how prevalent or how extensive lateral gene exchange is in the microbial world, but its "footprints" are clear in many of the microbial genomes sequenced to date.<sup>18</sup> For example, while transfer of antibiotic resistance via plasmids in bacteria today is well known, those plasmid-encoded genes rarely, if ever, become part of the host genome.
<P>
Results coming from microbial sequences present a plethora of stimulating challenges to the information scientist as well. Some already have been mentioned, such as previously unknown genes and lateral gene transfers. There are, however, more challenges. Microbial genes comprise the precursors to many genes possessed by more recently evolved organisms such as humans. In the several billion years of evolution that separate microbes from humans, many of those genes have diverged and assumed other, newer functions that are vital to more complex, multicellular creatures. Nonetheless, sequence similarities often allow human or animal genes to be traced to their microbial origins, thus permitting the reconstruction of evolutionary pathways. This is not always simple, since reconstructions can vary depending on which genes are looked at. 
<P> Having complete genomes to examine also permits investigations into genome 
  organization. Microbes can respond to environmental cues, and complete genomes 
  promise better understanding of response regulation. This, in turn, may have 
  considerable importance for many potential microbial applications in remediation 
  and waste cleanup. Many microbes normally are benign but can become pathogenic 
  under circumstances of host immune suppression (e.g., <i>Pneumocystis carinii</i> 
  and AIDS). We have tended to look at the microbes that are easiest to study 
  or cause disease, and we have looked less extensively at those that usually 
  don't cause disease. Consequently, the operational nature of their pathogenicity 
  is largely unexplored. Perhaps most obscure to us are the interactions among 
  different microbes in their environments. Many microbes live in consortia with 
  other species, and we know virtually nothing about community interactions. Challenges 
  abound. 
<P>
<B>Future Plans</b><BR>

The major focus of the DOE MGP will continue to be on the genomic sequencing of microbes relevant to DOE needs. These needs cut across several DOE program areas, including energy use and production; bioremediation, especially the Natural and Accelerated Bioremediation Research (NABIR) Program of the Office of Biological and Environmental Research (OBER); and, most recently, the Climate Change Technology Initiative. A new challenge that DOE is addressing is global climate change due to atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases. As part of its role in this new initiative, OBER will expand MGP's focus to include the genomic sequencing of microbes that consume CO2 or produce alternate fuel sources such as methane or hydrogen. From this, we hope to identify and understand more fully how organisms and their enzymes regulate these important gases. 
<P>
The MGP also is expanding its emphases to include the development of novel strategies to cost-effectively determine the DNA sequence of microbes closely related to others for which the complete sequence is already known, i.e., to determine the sequence without having to start from scratch. Additionally, the MGP is developing novel strategies and tools for characterizing, manipulating, and modeling entire reaction pathways or regulatory networks; for the first time, this involves studying entire groups of genes that work together to produce specific products or determine specific behaviors. This aim, often called "functional genomics," will merit increasing emphasis as more genomes become available and comparative studies more revealing. Bioinformatics, the computational analysis of microbial sequences to identify genes and biologically meaningful features, remains an important aim as well. 
    <P>
These are dramatic and exciting times for microbiology as, standing on the verge of a new millennium, whole-genome sequencing is radically changing the way that microbiology can be done. We have become more appreciative of the microbial world's reach on earth, realizing how little we know about it and wondering at its potential benefits if only we are wise enough to discover them. We might be excused, then, if those well-known words of the fictional Captains Kirk and Picard of the Starships <I>Enterprise</i> come to mind: "To seek out new life... to boldly go where no one has gone before." For microbiology today, they fit remarkably well.
