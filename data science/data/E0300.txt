<h2>18.9 How to hook hardware interrupts</h2>

<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: How do I register my DJGPP function as a hardware interrupt handler?</em>

<br><p>
<p><strong>A</strong>:  The optimal setup depends on the interrupt frequency and on the
amount of processing it requires.  Therefore, only some basic
considerations and techniques are listed below.  What combination of these
is best for your application is up to you to decide.

<p>First, some background.  Hardware interrupts can occur when the
processor is either in real mode (like when your program calls some DOS
service) or in protected mode.  When your program runs under a DPMI
host, hardware interrupts are caught by the DPMI host and passed to
protected mode first; only if unhandled, they are then reflected to real
mode.  Therefore, in DPMI mode you can get away with installing only a
protected-mode handler.  However, if the interrupts happen at a high
frequency (say, more than 10 KHz), and if your program spends lots of
time calling real-mode DOS/BIOS functions, then the overhead of the
interrupt reflection from real to protected mode might be too painful,
and you should consider installing a real-mode interrupt handler in
addition to the protected-mode one.  Such a real-mode handler will be
called <em>before</em> the interrupt gets to the DPMI host, and handle the
interrupt entirely in real mode, so it must be written in assembly and
located in conventional memory (below the 1MB mark).  If you need to
hook an interrupt with both PM and RM handlers, you must hook the PM
interrupt first, then the RM one (because hooking the PM interrupt
modifies the RM one).  Also, you should know that some DPMI hosts don't
allow you to hook the RM interrupt (CWSDPMI does), and some call both
handlers, no matter in what mode the interrupt arrived (CWSDPMI will
only call one of them); the only way to be sure is to try.

<p>To install a protected-mode interrupt handler, you do this:

<ul>
<li>In general, your handler should be written in assembly to be
bullet-proof.  You should lock<a rel=footnote href="faq25.html"><sup>35</sup></a> all the
memory (code, data and stack) that could be touched by your handler
during interrupt processing (this is virtually impossible if the handler
is written in C), explicitly issue the `STI' instruction before `IRET',
and perform all the other chores described in the DPMI spec (see <a href="faq22_6.html">DOS Protected Mode Interface Specification</a>).  To install an assembly handler, you should do this:

<ul>
<li>Call <code>__dpmi_get_protected_mode_interrupt_vector</code> and save the
structure it returns (to restore the previous handler address before your
program exits).

<li>Lock all the memory your handler touches, the code of the handler
itself, and any function it calls, with a series of calls to
<code>__dpmi_lock_linear_region</code>.  Failure to lock memory accessed
during the interrupt handling will cause your program to crash. 
Alternatively, you could set the <code>_CRT0_FLAG_LOCK_MEMORY</code> bit in
the <code>_crt0_startup_flags</code> variable, like this:

<pre>#include &lt;crt0.h&gt;

int _crt0_startup_flags = _CRT0_FLAG_LOCK_MEMORY;
</pre>

<p>Another possibility is to disable virtual memory by using CWSDPR0 as
your DPMI server.

</p><li>Finally, call <code>__dpmi_set_protected_mode_interrupt_vector</code> and pass
it a pointer to a <code>__dpmi_paddr</code> structure filled with the value
returned by <code>_my_cs()</code> in the <code>selector</code> field and the address
of your function in the <code>offset32</code> field. 
</ul>

<li>If your handler function is written in C, you should generally call the
<code>_go32_dpmi_XXX</code> functions instead of the bare-bones API wrappers
whose names start with <code>__dpmi_.</code>  Specifically:

<ul>
<li>Call <code>_go32_dpmi_get_protected_mode_interrupt_vector.</code>  This
function puts the selector and offset of the specified interrupt vector
into the <code>pm_selector</code> and <code>pm_offset</code> fields of the structure
pointed to by its second argument.  This data should be saved and later
passed to <code>_go32_dpmi_set_protected_mode_interrupt_vector</code> to
restore the vector on exit.

<li>Call <code>_go32_dpmi_allocate_iret_wrapper,</code> passing it the address of
your function in the <code>pm_offset</code> field and the value returned by
<code>_my_cs()</code> in the <code>pm_selector</code> field.  The <code>pm_offset</code>
field will get replaced with the address of the wrapper function which
is a small assembler function that handles everything an interrupt
handler should do on entry and before exit (and what the code GCC
generates for an ordinary C function doesn't include); the effect is
similar to using the <code>interrupt</code> or <code>_interrupt</code> keyword in
other DOS-based compilers.

<li>You then call <code>_go32_dpmi_set_protected_mode_interrupt_vector</code> with
the address of the <code>_go32_dpmi_seginfo</code> structure you got from
<code>_go32_dpmi_allocate_iret_wrapper</code>.

<li>If you want your handler to chain to the previous handler, call
<code>_go32_dpmi_chain_protected_mode_interrupt_vector.</code>  This will set
up a wrapper function which, when called, will call your handler, then
jump to the previous handler after your handler returns.  Put the
address of your handler into the <code>pm_offset</code> field and the value of
<code>_my_cs</code> into the <code>pm_selector</code> field of the
<code>_go32_dpmi_seginfo</code> structure and pass a pointer to it to this
function.  <code>_go32_dpmi_chain_protected_mode_interrupt_vector</code>
allocates the wrapper internally, and also arranges for the interrupt to
call your handler, so you need not call
<code>_go32_dpmi_allocate_iret_wrapper</code> and
<code>_go32_dpmi_set_protected_mode_interrupt_vector</code> functions
yourself.  Also note that currently,
<code>_go32_dpmi_chain_protected_mode_interrupt_vector</code> doesn't return
to you the address of the wrapper it allocates, so that wrapper cannot
be freed by your program.  It will be freed by the DJGPP exit code,
though, so this issue is only of concern to programs that allocate and
free lots of wrappers. 
</ul>

<p>The problem with writing handlers in C as above is that in practice you
can't lock all of memory the handler itself uses, because there's no
standard way of finding the size of the code of a C function, or the
addresses on the stack used by C code.  Thus, this approach is generally
unsuitable for production-quality software and should be used only when
the program is known not to page (i.e., if only the physical memory is
used).  You might consider disabling virtual memory to make sure your
program doesn't page.  To accomplish this, either set the
<code>_CRT0_FLAG_LOCK_MEMORY</code> bit in the <code>_crt0_startup_flags</code>
variable, or use CWSDPR0 or PMODE/DJ as your DPMI host.  In fact, using
one of these methods is the recommended way of debugging the first
versions of a program that hooks hardware interrupts; only after you are
sure that your basic machinery works should you move to testing it in a
setup when paging might happen.

<p>Additional considerations apply if your interrupt handler is a C<tt>++</tt>
class member function.  First, you need to remember that member
functions expect a hidden extra first parameter--this is important if
you use member functions as callbacks.  Second, if the function is
virtual, you will need to lock the class's virtual table.  Third, you
need to lock the object itself, not only the method you call on it.

<p>Note that <code>_CRT0_FLAG_LOCK_MEMORY</code> is only recommended for small
programs that run on a machine where enough physical memory is always
available, because the startup code currently doesn't test if memory is
indeed locked, and if there's not enough physical memory installed to
page in all of the memory your program needs, you can end up with
unlocked or partially unlocked memory, which will crash your program. 
If you want to make sure all memory is locked, use a DPMI server which
disables paging.

<p>Buffers in conventional memory (allocated via the
<code>__dpmi_allocate_dos_memory</code> function and its equivalents)
generally need not be locked, since most DPMI servers lock DOS memory by
default.  For safer code, you could try to lock them, and if the call to
<code>__dpmi_lock_linear_region</code> returns a failure indication, it means
that the buffer is already locked.

<p>It is possible to lock only the code and data segments of your program,
but leave everything else unlocked.  The following code snippet shows
how:

<pre> #include &lt;crt0.h&gt;

 int _crt0_startup_flags =
   _CRT0_FLAG_LOCK_MEMORY | _CRT_FLAG_NONMOVE_SBRK;

 int (main (void)
 {
   _crt0_startup_flags &amp;= ~_CRT0_FLAG_LOCK_MEMORY;
   ...
 }
</pre>

<p>This locks the <code>.data</code>, <code>.bss</code>, and <code>.text</code> segments of
the program, and its stack, but doesn't lock the heap allocated after
<code>main</code> is called. 
</ul>

<p>To install a real-mode interrupt handler, you do this:

<ul>
<li>Call <code>__dpmi_get_real_mode_interrupt_vector</code> and save the structure
it returns (to restore the previous handler address before your program
exits).

<li>Allocate some conventional memory with <code>__dpmi_allocate_dos_memory</code>
and put the code of your handler there with the <code>dosmemput</code> function. 
(You could also call one of the functions which allocate a real-mode
call-back, but these will cause a mode switch on every interrupt, which you
want to avoid; otherwise there is no point in installing a real-mode
handler, right?)

<li>Put the address which <code>__dpmi_allocate_dos_memory</code> returned into a
<code>__dpmi_raddr</code> structure (the lower 4 bits into <code>offset16</code>
field, the rest into <code>segment</code> field), then call
<code>__dpmi_set_real_mode_interrupt_vector.</code>
</ul>

<p>Note that Windows 9X is reported to call both the RM and PM handlers if
both are installed, at least for some interrupts (CWSDPMI only invokes
one of them).  So, if you want to play safe, you will need some kind of
a semaphore variable that the two handlers could use so that only one of
them actually handles the interrupt in any given case.

<p>The DPMI spec says that 3 <em>software</em> interrupts are special, in
that they also get reflected to a protected-mode handler.  These
interrupts are: 1Ch (the timer tick interrupt), 23h (Keyboard Break
interrupt), and 24h (Critical Error interrupt).  This means that, to
catch these interrupts, you need to install a protected-mode handler
only.  Unlike hardware interrupts, it doesn't make sense to install dual
RM and PM handlers for these software interrupts.  In particular,
Windows will call both RM and PM handlers if you install both, so you
effectively wind up handling the same interrupt twice.

<p>For examples of installing and using hardware interrupt handlers, see
the sources of the Allegro library, the sample code written by
<a href="mailto:bill@tanihwa.org">Bill Currie</a>, the Sound Blaster
interrupt-driven functions, the <code>mkkbd</code> package, and the
<code>libhw</code> library, described under <a href="faq22_4.html">sample DJGPP packages</a>. 
<a href="mailto:alaric@abwillms.demon.co.uk">Alaric B. Williams</a> has written a
<a href="http://www.abwillms.demon.co.uk/prog/djints.txt">tutorial on interrupt handling</a>.

<p>The DJGPP User's Guide includes a <a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/ug/interrupts/hwirqs.html">chapter on hardware interrupts</a>, written by Peter
Marinov, which includes sample code for hooking hardware interrupts.

<p>The file <code>src/libc/go32/dpmiexcp.c</code> in the DJGPP library sources,
<code>djlsrNNN.zip</code>, is one example of the subtleties involved with
installing a real-mode interrupt handler.  The handlers themselves are
in the file <code>src/libc/go32/exceptn.S</code>.
