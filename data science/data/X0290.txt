        Visits Kings Lodge<br>
        in New Brunswick</font></h2>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Spring is an exciting time of year. The turkeys begin to gobble, the 
        trees start sprouting their green foliage and the black bears awaken from 
        their long winter hibernation. Spring black bear hunting in New Brunswick, 
        Canada would be the focus for both Kirk Fox and myself on this trip. The 
        Kings Lodge is located in the south central region of New Brunswick only 
        a few miles outside of Fredericton. The 2002 spring bear season in New 
        Brunswick opened on April 15th and continues through June 29th. Kirk and 
        I decided to hunt in mid May, hoping to avoid the mosquitoes and black 
        flies. </p>
      <p>Wallace Gilbert, who prefers to go by the name Wally, is the owner and 
        licensed guide at Kings Lodge. Before this story goes any further, let 
        me tell you that the experience of meeting Wally is something you will 
        not soon forget. He is an honest, hard working individual who has spent 
        most of his life making a living in the lumber industry. His comical personality 
        and quick wit will keep you entertained throughout the entire stay. </p>
      <p>Wally owns or has access to over 6200 acres of land, which holds not 
        only bear, but also deer, moose, rabbits, grouse and ducks. As mentioned 
        on the Kings Lodge web site, his land is adjacent to the Acadia Game refuge, 
        which is approximately 20 square miles. Wally limits his hunts to only 
        6 hunters per week on spring bear hunts. During the week that we hunted, 
        Wally had 9 different bait stations available, although he indicated that 
        he plans to have up to 16 stations. Most of the stations had permanent 
        tree stands, with a few that had to be hunted from a ground blind or a 
        portable stand. </p>
      <p><img src="images/images_articles/kingslodge_forest.jpg" width="250" height="188" align="left">Kirk 
        and I decided to make the fourteen-hour drive over night, hoping to avoid 
        traffic and arrive early Monday morning. We crossed the border at St Croix, 
        New Brunswick stopping at both the US customs checkpoint and the Canadian 
        Customs checkpoint. Remember, when traveling to Canada with a firearm, 
        you must register your firearm on both sides. There is no charge on the 
        US side, however, in Canada you must pay a $50.00(Canadian) fee. The Canadian 
        registration is good for one year, so if you return to Canada with a firearm 
        on another trip and it's within a year, you do not need to pay the fee 
        again. Just remember to bring your prior registration along with you. 
      </p>
      <p>The lodge, named after Wally's grandfather, is located approximately 
        4 miles off highway 10. Exact directions to the lodge can be found on 
        the Kings Lodge web site. Although the lodge has running water, including 
        a hot shower, and electricity via a gas powered generator, you should 
        arrive expecting a very rustic experience. While the lodge itself was 
        adequate for the hunt, do not arrive expecting four star accommodations. 
        There are two main bedrooms, each having three beds. While it is possible 
        to drive a car on the dirt road leading to the lodge, I would recommend 
        a truck or SUV, as rain or snow could make it difficult to drive on the 
        muddy roads. After arriving at the lodge and meeting Wally, we were treated 
        to a nice hot breakfast consisting of eggs, bacon and toast. After breakfast, 
        we drove into Fredericton to purchase our licenses.</p>
      <p>In New Brunswick, all non-residents are required to hunt with a licensed 
        guide. Even though New Brunswick has a draw system for black bear tags, 
        if you hunt with Kings Lodge, you do not need to enter the draw. Since 
        Wally is a licensed guide, he can purchase the bear tags directly from 
        the Fish and Wildlife office when you arrive for your hunt. The cost of 
        a bear license, which is good for either spring or fall, is $80.50(Canadian). 
        Hunters must be at least 16 years of age to hunt black bear. Also keep 
        in mind, all hunters born on or after January 1, 1981 must show proof 
        of a Firearms Safety / Hunter Education course. Hunters born previous 
        to 1981 may show a previous hunting license from your home state as proof 
        of hunting experience. </p>
      <p>After purchasing our licenses, we returned to the lodge to prepare for 
        our week of hunting. As much as I hate to say it once again, the weather 
        seemed to be a major factor throughout our 5-day hunt. Most of the week 
        we dealt with overcast skies, light rain and cold temperatures. </p>
      <p>A typical day of hunting spring black bear usually begins in early afternoon. 
        Although we had the option to hunt all day long, we decided to mostly 
        hunt the afternoon and evenings. Wally would take us to the stand one 
        at a time starting around 2:00 PM in the afternoon. He utilized a large 
        two seat 4-wheel drive four-wheeler to take us to our stands. Remember, 
        be sure to bring a gun case along on your trip. You must keep the gun 
        cased while being transported to your hunting stand. After arriving at 
        the stand, you settle in for about a six-hour wait, watching and listening 
        for sign of a bear to approach. The surroundings consist of thick trees 
        with a shooting lane cut to the bait station. Be prepared with waterproof 
        footwear, as there are lots of small streams and muddy bogs you may need 
        to walk through. It's usually a half-hour after dark when Wally returns 
        to pick you up. Kirk and I hunted five evenings and one morning, but it 
        wasn't until the last evening that we finally had some luck.</p>
      <p><img src="images/images_articles/kingslodge_kirk1.jpg" width="256" height="225" align="right" alt="Kirk with his bear">Kirk 
        entered his tree stand around 3:30 PM. After being in the stand for about 
        an hour, he heard a branch break off to his left. With the forest being 
        so thick, except for his shooting lane to the bait station, he couldn't 
        determine what made the noise. After 10 minutes, he was startled by something 
        shaking the ladder at the base of the tree stand. He peeked over the edge 
        of his tree stand and saw the tops of a bear's ear. As you can imagine, 
        Kirk's heart began to race. What do you do when a bear decides to crawl 
        up into the tree stand with you? Kirk remained calm. The bear gave out 
        a whoof and trotted a few yards away from the back of the stand. Kirk 
        caught glimpses of the bear as it circled the stand in the thick timber. 
        Finally, after 15 minutes of meandering, the bear approached the bait. 
        It took one well-placed shot from his 300 Winchester magnum rifle to drop 
        the bear in its tracks. </p>
      <p>Saturday morning was spent registering the bear at the ranger station 
        in Fredericton, and having the bear processed for our trip home. Wally 
        made all the arrangements to have the necessary paperwork completed in 
        order to process and transport the bear home. Just a reminder, make sure 
        you have the proper export papers from the fish and wildlife division 
        if you plan to bring the hide or meat back to the United States. While 
        at the check station, the game warden confirmed our suspicions that the 
        cold and rainy weather seemed to be affecting bear movement. They had 
        recorded a lower than normal harvest at that point in the season. In addition, 
        the meat processing shop where we took the bear to be skinned also commented 
        on the low number of bear that had been harvested to date. Many outfitters 
        in the area were having a tough season.</p>
      <p>If you plan to make a spring bear hunting trip, take the following items 
        into consideration. Be sure to bring some type of bug protection, to prevent 
        the mosquitoes and black flies from biting. In the event of bug bites, 
        make sure you have some type of bite antiseptic to treat the itch. Make 
        certain you bring some sort of padded seating, as you will be spending 
        six to twelve hours in the tree stand each day. Finally, you may want 
        to take a camera along in the tree stand to capture any unexpected moments. 
      </p>

      <p>Overall, our experience with Kings Lodge will be a memorable one. It 
        was nice to return from an evening hunt and have a hot meal on the table 
        waiting. Our meals consisted of beef tips, spaghetti, beef and vegetable 
        stew, barbecue chicken and pork chops. Lunch consisted of hot dogs and 
        hamburgers on the grill. If there was anything we needed, we simply had 
        to ask Wally and he would get it for us. </p>
      <p>In addition to bear hunting, Kings Lodge also offers moose and deer hunts. 
        Moose tags for non-residents are selected by a draw system, with 100 tags 
        available. Keep in mind, applications for the non-resident moose draw 
        must be submitted between January 1 and April 30th. For more information 
        on moose hunting regulations, see <a href="http://www.gnb.ca/0078/fw/index_fw.asp" target="_blank">http://www.gnb.ca/0078/fw/index_fw.asp</a>. 
        Buck licenses can be purchased over the counter. </p>
      <p>If you're interested in fishing while at Kings Lodge, you have several 
        options available. Right behind the lodge is a stream, which holds small 
        brook trout. Nearby, Wally can take you to several lakes, which hold trout, 
        yellow perch and pickerel. If you're interested in catching some nice 
        size trout, and don't mind paying a small fee, Wally can take you to nearby 
        pond where you're guaranteed to catch several nice size fish. </p>
      <p>The price for a spring bear hunt at Kings Lodge is reasonable. At the 
        time of this article, a six-day hunt for either spring or fall bear is 
        $800.00. This price includes meals, lodging, guide services and skinning. 
        In addition, Wally offers some nice specials. If two or more hunters book 
        a hunt, Wally will drop the price to $700.00 per hunter. For families, 
        one parent pays full price and the son, daughter or spouse pays half price. 
        If you have any questions about pricing or want more information on a 
        hunt at King's Lodge, check out the Kings Lodge web site.</p>
