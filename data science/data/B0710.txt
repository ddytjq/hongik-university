      important information which will assist you in making the right choice for 
      your own particular circumstances and will help you understand the 
      products available from Kensington Mortgage Company. You should read all 
      contract documentation carefully and obtain independent legal or other 
      advice (for example, from a Citizens Advice Bureau or Money Advice Centre 
      or Law Centre) before entering into any agreement.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>You and your 
      intermediary<br></strong>Loans provided by Kensington Mortgage Company may 
      be negotiated through a mortgage intermediary, eg a mortgage broker, 
      financial adviser, solicitor, estate agent or accountant. The intermediary 
      may charge you a fee as part of that arrangement. This fee is not a 
      condition of a Kensington Mortgage Company loan.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We only recognise 
      intermediaries registered under the Mortgage Code Register of 
      Intermediaries.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We will usually pay 
      commission to your mortgage intermediary. Your intermediary will discuss 
      this with you when discussing your mortgage application and will tell you 
      in writing the amount of any payment received from us, the purpose of the 
      payment, the basis of calculation and when and how it will be 
      payable.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Repayment 
      methods</strong></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>With 
      most of our products we offer two different ways to repay the loan:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Capital 
      repayment</strong> - monthly payments cover interest and capital and by 
      the end of the term, provided all payments are made on time, the loan will 
      be repaid.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Interest 
      only</strong> &#150; If you have an
      interest-only mortgage it is your responsibility to ensure that an
      appropriate repayment vehicle is in place and to check regularly that it
      is on target to repay the amount of your mortgage. You must also ensure
      that payments for endowment or pension policies and other investment
      plans, such as individual savings accounts, are kept up to date and
      continue to provide you with the level of cover required.</font><font face="Verdana"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
      </font></span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you have an
      endowment policy, the Association of British Insurers and its members have
      agreed a Code of Practice to ensure formal reviews of endowment mortgage
      policies are carried out regularly. Under the ABI Code, insurers will tell
      you if a shortfall is likely to arise where the life policy was bought
      with the intention of paying off all or part of the mortgage.</font></p>
      <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If
      you have a mortgage and/or repayment vehicle which will continue beyond
      your retirement date, it is important that you ensure that you will be
      able to continue to meet your regular payments.</font></span></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Loan term</strong> - 
      Repayment periods range from 5 to 30 years. There is no maximum age 
      provided you can make your payments each month.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Variable and fixed 
      interest rates</strong><br> Interest rates are <strong>either</strong> 
      variable or fixed for a period of time (the rate at which and the period 
      for which it is fixed will be set out in the offer letter). When a fixed 
      rate term expires the interest rate is variable.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Variable interest 
      rates</strong>           
                 
                
                 
                  
                
               &#150; Our variable 
      interest rates are based either on LIBOR (the 3 month London Inter-bank
      Offered Rate) plus an additional percentage depending on the product (for
      loans in Scotland), or on the Kensington&nbsp;Variable Rate, which is linked to LIBOR
      plus an additional percentage depending on the
      product. The offer 
      letter will state which rate applies.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">LIBOR changes daily with 
      market movements. In order to combine the advantage of a mortgage 
      rate that closely follows movements in market rates with the necessary 
      stability for financial planning, we will normally vary the Kensington 
      Variable Rate every 3 months. We do, however, reserve the 
      right to change this more often if we choose.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Part Capital 
      Repayments</strong></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>If 
      you repay part of the loan early, the interest charged on your account is 
      adjusted with immediate effect and your payment reduced on the next 
      payment date.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Buildings 
      insurance</strong> - Properties must be insured for their full reinstatement 
      value. Cover can be arranged through our block policy. If you 
      wish, the policy can also protect your contents. Information is contained 
      in the application form and a quote with further details will be included
      with the offer letter.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Life insurance</strong> &#150; We recommend that you ensure that you have adequate 
      life insurance cover to protect your family.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Accident,
      sickness 
      and unemployment insurance</strong> &#150; We recommend that you ensure your 
      mortgage payments are protected by accident, sickness and unemployment 
      insurance. Cover can be arranged through our block policy. Information is 
      contained in the application form and a quote with further details will be 
      included with the offer letter.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong><font size="3">Other 
      fees and charges</font></strong></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Application
      fee</strong> - An application fee to cover the valuation fee and the cost 
      of processing your application is payable by you when you apply for a 
      loan. Your mortgage intermediary will advise you of the amount of the 
      fee.
      Arrangement 
      fee - An arrangement fee is payable when we complete the loan. 
      The amount of the fee will be included in any 
      illustration. Solicitor's 
      costs &#150; We will also instruct your solicitor to act for us 
      provided the firm has two or more partners. If this is not the case, we 
      will instruct our own solicitors to act for us. In either case the 
      solicitor&#146;s costs will be payable by you.Early Redemption 
      Fees - If you repay your loan within the first three years we will charge interest to 
      the end of the month in which the loan is repaid and an additional sum 
      equivalent to a percentage of the amount redeemed depending on the type of 
      loan and how long it has been in existence. Full details of the charge 
      applicable to your loan will be set out in the offer 
      letter. If you repay your loan after three years we will charge interest
      to the end of the month in which the loan is repaid.Other 
      charges - A full list of all other charges covering the operation 
      and repayment of your mortgage account will be sent to you with
      the offer letter.</font></p>
