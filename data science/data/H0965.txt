<p>Measles is a serious disease trying to make a comeback.  Starting in July 1996, an ongoing program will be implemented to protect Canadians against measles.</p>
<p>Experience has proven that it takes two doses of the measles vaccine to protect everyone, so an inoculation program has begun to make sure young Canadians get that second dose.</p>
<p>The following information should help you better understand the disease and the steps necessary to prevent it.</p>
<p><text="red"><strong><font SIZE="+3">Q</font></strong> . What is measles?</p>
<p><text="000000"><strong><font SIZE="+3">A</font></strong> . Measles is easily caught.  It's a serious disease, one that can cause pneumonia, ear infections, brain damage and, sometimes, death.  Canada has had large outbreaks of measles in the recent past, and four out of every five cases are school children.</p>
<p><strong><font SIZE="+3">Q</font></strong> . How often do the most serious cases of measles occur?</p>
<p><strong><font SIZE="+3">A</font></strong> . Measles causes death in one out of every 3,000 cases.  It causes brain damage in one out of every 1,000 cases.  Pneumonia happens in 10 to 50 of every 1,000 cases of measles, and ear infections happen in 10 of every 1,000 cases.</p>
<img Align="right" SRC="measl2.gif" WIDTH="489" HEIGHT="350">
<p><strong><font SIZE="+3">Q</font></strong> . Why are outbreaks still occurring?</p>
<p><strong><font SIZE="+3">A</font></strong> . Most children are vaccinated against measles just after their first birthday.  But that single dose doesn't work for 5 to 10 of each 100 children.  A second dose will protect all children.</p>
<p><strong><font SIZE="+3">Q</font></strong> .  Are there other places where children receive two doses?</p>
<p><strong><font SIZE="+3">A</font></strong> . Absolutely.  Encouraged by the World Health Organization, many countries in Europe and the Americas (including the USA) now give two doses of measles vaccine and have prevented measles outbreaks.</p>
<center><img SRC="mslfact3.gif" ALT="Canada is the last country in the western hemisphere to implement a second dose measles immunization program." WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="147"></center>
<p><strong><font SIZE="+3">Q</font></strong> . Could there be any reactions to the vaccine?</p>
<p><strong><font SIZE="+3">A</font></strong> . The vaccine has been used in Canada for over 25 years.  It is safe and takes effect in 10 to 14 days.</p>
<p>Most children, especially those who have been vaccinated before, will not have any reaction.  A very few may have a mild rash, fever, and feel unwell 6 to 10 days after the needle is given.  This reaction will last for 1 to 3 days.  </p>
<p>If your child has a high fever, or any other serious symptom after vaccination, call your doctor.  As with any injection, there may be some redness or swelling at the injection site.</p>
<p><strong><font SIZE="+3">Q</font></strong> . If there is a possibility of reaction, why are you vaccinating children?</p>
<p><strong><font SIZE="+3">A</font></strong> . The possibility of a bad reaction to the vaccine is 1,000 times less than the chance of a child being hospitalized or dying from measles.  These reactions usually occur only in children who are susceptible (at risk of getting measles).</p>
<p><strong><font SIZE="+3">Q</font></strong> . Is there anyone who should not have the MMR vaccine?</p>
<p><strong><font SIZE="+3">A</font></strong> . Yes.  Some people should not have the vaccination, including those who:
<ul>
<li>have a disease that lowers the body's ability to fight infection.
<li>have a fever or illness more serious than a cold on the day of the vaccination.
<li>are taking medication that lower the body's ability to fight infection.
<li>have a SEVERE allergy to any component of the vaccine (gelatin, neomycin, lactalbumin hydrolysate, sorbitol or lactose)
<li>have had an anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of a measles, mumps or rubella containing vaccine.
</ul>
<p>If you think that any of the conditions apply, please check with your local public health unit, health department or your doctor.</p>
<center><img SRC="mslfact1.gif" ALT="Without this change to the immunization program, a measle outbreak could occur in Alberta in the next few years." WIDTH="335" HEIGHT="147"></center>
<p><strong><font SIZE="+3">Q</font></strong> . Why is the rubella vaccine included in the second dose?</p>
<p><strong><font SIZE="+3">A</font></strong> . Rubella (German measles) is usually a mild disease in children.  </p>
<p>However, if a mother gets rubella during the first three months of pregnancy, it can harm her unborn baby, causing blindness, deafness, heart defects, brain damage or even a miscarriage.</p>
<p>It is now known that one of every 20 pregnant women in Alberta is not protected from the virus.  A second dose of rubella vaccine in children will decrease the number of cases and the risk of exposure for pregnant women.</p>

<p><strong><font SIZE="+3">Q</font></strong> . Where do children receive their second vaccination?</p>
<p><strong><font SIZE="+3">A</font></strong> . Children at school entry age (4 to 6 years of age) will receive the vaccine at the regular clinics organized by your local public health unit.</p>
