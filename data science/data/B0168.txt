      <p><span class="results">OVERVIEW</span></p>
      <p>2001 was yet another year of outstanding achievement for Newcastle Building 
        Society. Our success was once again built on the values which have served 
        us so well in the past and which we will continue to keep to in the future. 
        Putting our customers first, providing excellent customer service, developing 
        our staff, investing in new technologies and supporting good causes - 
        these are our priorities, and guiding principles.</p>
      <p class="results">MUTUALITY </p>
      <p>We strongly believe in, and aim to maintain our mutual status. This is 
        a principle which gives all our members an equal say in how we are run. 
        It also gives us the flexibility to act in a way which would not be possible 
        if we were a limited company. </p>
      <p>We do not attempt to maximise profits but operate a policy of profit 
        sufficiency under which our profit grows at a rate that will maintain 
        our strong capital ratios and allows us to invest in the infrastructure 
        of our business. </p>
      <p>The Board's aim is to concentrate on achieving this level of profit whilst 
        serving the best interests of our customers, our employees and the communities 
        we work in. Of course, we cannot offer the very best rate of interest 
        on each of our accounts - no bank or building society ever could. Clearly 
        we have to balance the interests of our borrowers and our savers, particularly 
        in an environment where there is a lot of uncertainty. However, with companies 
        that are household names getting into serious financial difficulty, it 
        is vital that we provide our customers not only with a safe place for 
        their money, but also one which they can rely on to provide solid returns. 
      </p>
      <p>Communicating with our members is important to us and we continue to 
        do this in a number of different ways. </p>
      <p>Last year, we held 'Meet The Chief Executive' roadshows in Newcastle, 
        Glasgow, York, Nottingham and Berwick. The roadshows gave our members 
        the opportunity to question Chief Executive, Robert Hollinshead, and senior 
        members of his team on any aspect of the Society's business. Feedback 
        from roadshows is always very useful and often leads to us introducing 
        new initiatives. We have launched products on the strength of what members 
        have told us at previous roadshows and, at one of the most recent events, 
        a customer from York suggested a new way of involving members raising 
        money for charity. We also regularly publish NE1, our magazine for members. 
        The magazine, which features details of new products and services, our 
        activities in the community and general lifestyle topics, has proved extremely 
        popular with readers and, again, we always welcome comment and feedback 
        on its content. </p>
      <p class="results">MORTGAGES </p>
      <p>2001 was a record year for the Society with new mortgage lending of £496 
        million. This is some £133 million more than that achieved in 2000. 2001 
        also saw a change to the way in which we calculate the interest on our 
        mortgage products. From December 1, we offered new and existing borrowers 
        the opportunity to have their mortgage payments calculated on a daily 
        interest basis. Under the new system, every payment a borrower makes immediately 
        reduces the balance on which we calculate interest. As the balance of 
        the loan reduces, so too will the amount of interest charged on it. </p>
      <p>The Society's mortgage portfolio is of excellent quality and at the end 
        of 2001 mortgage arrears were at their lowest level for many years. </p>
      <p class="results">RETAIL SAVINGS </p>
      <p>The net retail savings inflow in 2001 was £230 million, an increase of 
        57% when compared to 2000. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee 
        announced seven separate cuts in interest rates in 2001. This took the 
        base rate from 6% in January to 4% by the end of December. This reduction 
        in interest rates, combined with problems on the stock market, resulted 
        in a very difficult year for savers.</p>
      <p> In response to these uncertain economic conditions, we launched several 
        issues of a Guaranteed Equity Bond. This product offers unlimited growth 
        potential as the interest rate payable on it is linked to the performance 
        of three leading international Stock Market indices. At the same time, 
        the product provided investors with the peace of mind of knowing that 
        all of their capital investment was safe and would be returned in full 
        at the end of the five year term, regardless of how the markets performed. 
      </p>

      <p class="results">INNOVATION AND NEW TECHNOLOGY</p>
      <p> The Newcastle believes it can claim a competitive edge through its commitment 
        to innovation and the exploitation of new technology. These efforts were 
        recognised in 2001 when the Newcastle picked up two prestigious awards 
        for innovation. The Society won the Financial Sector Technology Award 
        for "Best Use of New Media in a Customer Facing Environment" and later 
        in the year we were named "Innovator of the Year" at the Mortgage Finance 
        Gazette Awards. </p>
      <p>Last year we spent over £1 million on a new workflow and document image 
        processing system. This allows incoming correspondence to be electronically 
        scanned and placed onto our computer network, which can then be accessed 
        and actioned by staff based in any of our offices. It has already facilitated 
        a more efficient distribution of departmental workloads and will result 
        in the introduction of more flexible working practices. We have launched 
        a pilot exercise to distribute work electronically to home workers and 
        to branches and this will be extended during 2002. </p>
      <p>We have also set up a 'virtual call centre' to back up the work carried 
        out by our call centre. At busy times, incoming calls can be directed 
        to skilled staff in the branch network. The success of the virtual call 
        centre has resulted in a decision to invest over £500,000 in a new telephone 
        system that will enable this operation to be extended further. </p>
      <p>The first phase of this new technology is due to be introduced in April 
        2002.</p>
      <p>We are using technology to allow our branches to offer a wider range 
        of services to our customers. Last year, we started a programme to install 
        Internet terminals into each of our 53 branches. This project, which will 
        be completed in 2002, will allow customers who visit any of our branches 
        to use the Internet and with the help of a member of staff, to search 
        for insurance quotes or browse through more than 30,000 products which 
        are available from our on-line shopping service. Workflow, the virtual 
        call centre and Internet in branches all demonstrate our long-held commitment 
        to embrace technology wherever it can improve our business. </p>
      <hr size="1">
      <p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
      <p class="results">THIRD PARTY SERVICES </p>
      <p>The skills and experience at the Newcastle are now also benefiting other 
        building societies. Through Newton Facilities Management Limited (75% 
        of which is owned by Newcastle Building Society, and 25% by the Melton 
        Mowbray Building Society) we are now providing fully managed information 
        technology services and support to the Stafford Railway Building Society.</p>
      <p> The contract includes providing software, hardware products and associated 
        IT support services. Our experts have trained Stafford Railway staff on 
        the new systems and our software is now used through-out the Stafford 
        Railway's business. </p>
      <p>Through Newcastle Direct we have been awarded contracts to provide administration 
        and call centre facilities for two major banks during the year. These 
        banks pass enquiries for sub-prime mortgages to the Newcastle which we 
        then process before placing the loans with our partner, Kensington Mortgage 
        Company. </p>
      <p>The further development of the provision of third party services is vitally 
        important to the Society as it enables the cost base to be spread over 
        a larger volume of work. </p>
      <hr size="1">
      <p align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
      <p class="results">STAFF </p>
      <p>At 31st December 2001, the Society employed 637 people. We recognise 
        the importance of our staff and the need to support and encourage them.</p>
      <p> We understand that for some people commitments outside work, such as 
        having to care for children, make holding down a regular nine to five 
        job almost impossible. Thanks to our new technology, an increasing number 
        of our staff will be able to choose their hours of work to suit their 
        circumstances. A home working pilot has commenced and we expect it to 
        be extended during the course of 2002. This means that our business will 
        be able to retain a group of skilled and experienced employees. </p>
      <p class="results">COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT </p>
      <p>We firmly believe we have a responsibility to the communities in which 
        we have a presence. It is a responsibility we discharge in two ways - 
        firstly by making our services available in those areas that are not well 
        served by financial institutions and secondly, by investing in local charities 
        and community groups. For a building society of our size, we have, at 
        53, a large number of branches and some are inevitably busier and more 
        profitable than others. So much so, if we were a PLC with profit as our 
        principal driver, we might find some of our branches were economically 
        unviable and the case for closing them would be too strong to resist. 
      </p>
      <p>Fortunately, we are not a PLC and we do not have to focus on maximising 
        returns to shareholders. As a mutual society, we are able to consider 
        the bigger picture, to act in the interests of the wider community. </p>
      <p>The other way in which we support our communities is through our programme 
        of charitable giving. In 2001, the Newcastle Building Society Community 
        Fund donated £80,000 to 85 local charities and voluntary groups. These 
        donations varied in size and were spread throughout the communities where 
        we have a branch presence. Our fund, which last year celebrated its 10th 
        anniversary, has three main objectives: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>to promote training and learning opportunities for people of all ages;</li>
        <li> to nurture and encourage new talent and </li>
        <li>to improve the quality of life in local communities. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="results">LOOKING FORWARD </p>
      <p>2001 was another excellent year for us. 2002 will, no doubt, present 
        its own challenges, but we are confident that we can meet and overcome 
        every one of them, and grasp new opportunities as they arise. </p>
      <p>We will continue to succeed by firmly keeping to our mutual values and 
        responsibilities to all our customers, and making the best possible use 
        of technology to allow us to unleash the full potential of our greatest 
        asset, our staff. </p>

      <p class="results">RESTATEMENT OF 2000 COMPARATIVES</p>
      <p> Following the introduction of UITF Abstract 29: "Website Development 
        Costs", the prior period balances have been restated to reflect the criteria 
        established in this Abstract for the capitalisation of such costs i.e. 
        that they are capitalised only to the extent that they create an enduring 
        asset or there are reasonable grounds for supposing that the website will 
        generate future economic benefits in excess of the amounts capitalised. 
        As a result of adopting this Abstract, £364,000 of website development 
        costs capitalised in the year ended 31 December 2000 have now been expensed 
        in that year. In addition, £49,000 of depreciation charged in the year 
        ended 31 December 2000 has also been treated as an administrative expense 
        to be consistent with the treatment of such costs. As a result of this 
        prior year adjustment, the net book value of both Group and Society tangible 
        fixed assets at 31 December 2000 has been decreased by £315,000, with 
        a corresponding decrease in the general reserve. </p>
      <p class="results">GROSS CAPITAL AS A PERCENTAGE OF SHARES AND BORROWINGS</p>
      <p>Gross capital represents reserves plus subscribed capital. The purpose 
        of capital is to provide a buffer against any losses arising from a society's 
        activities, thereby protecting investors' funds. The gross capital ratio 
        measures the extent to which a society's activities are funded by capital, 
        compared to shares and borrowings. The higher this ratio is, the greater 
        the protection for investors. </p>
      <p class="results">LIQUID ASSETS AS A PERCENTAGE OF SHARES AND BORROWINGS</p>
      <p>Liquid assets are assets held by a society which are in the form of cash 
        or assets which are readily convertible into cash. Newcastle Building 
        Society has a ratio of liquid assets to shares and borrowings which is 
        at a similar level to other societies. The ratio is maintained at a level 
        which the directors consider appropriate for the activities of the Society. 
      </p>
      <p class="results">PROFIT FOR THE YEAR AS A PERCENTAGE OF MEAN TOTAL ASSETS</p>
      <p>A society needs to make a reasonable level of profit each year in order 
        to maintain and strengthen its gross capital ratio. The Newcastle Building 
        Society operates a policy of profit sufficiency and one of the most appropriate 
        measures of profitability is to express profit as percentage of mean total 
        assets. Our ratio of profit to mean total assets is similar to that achieved 
        by other large and medium-sized societies. </p>
      <p class="results">MANAGEMENT EXPENSES FOR THE YEAR AS A PERCENTAGE OF MEAN 
        TOTAL ASSETS</p>
      <p>Management expenses are the costs of running the Society and comprise 
        administrative expenses, depreciation and amortisation. The lower this 
        ratio is, the greater a society's efficiency. The Society's management 
        expenses ratio has fallen for the last seven years and its level is similar 
        to or lower than that achieved by other societies of comparable asset 
        size. </p>
