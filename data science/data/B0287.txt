        </span></STRONG>Individual Savings Accounts (ISA) were introduced by the Government 
        on 6th April 1999. </p>
      <p>They offer a tax free savings scheme to replace TESSAs and PEPs (although 
        they will not affect any investments in TESSAs and PEPs in operation before 
        6th April 1999).</p>
      <p>ISAs are classified into two categories, Maxi and Mini:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> The Maxi ISA offers up to three types (components) of investment: 
          Cash, Stocks and Shares and Life Assurance. </li>
        <li>The Mini ISA can offer just one of these components.</li>
        <li><STRONG>Maxi ISA</STRONG> - may be one, two or all three of the ISA investment 
          options. All of these elements are combined in one ISA with the same 
          company or ISA Manager.</li>
        <li><STRONG>Mini ISA</STRONG> - may be any one of the three ISA investment options 
          but, unlike a Maxi ISA, the separate elements may be held with different 
          companies or ISA managers. However, you cannot hold a Maxi ISA and a 
          Mini ISA in the same tax year and you cannot subscribe to more than 
          one Mini ISA of each type in the same tax year. </li>

        If you choose to add to your existing Chelsea Mini Cash ISA (2nd Issue) 
        in subsequent tax years, you can benefit from our tiered interest rates. 
        As your balance in this account reaches the next level, the higher rate 
        is automatically applied to the whole balance for the time it remains 
        within that level. </p>
      <p>Under the current ISA Regulations, you can invest a maximum of &pound;3,000 
        per tax year. To achieve the higher rate for balances of &pound;6,000 
        and over, you will need to add to your ISA over two or more consecutive 
        tax years. Following any tax year in which you do not add to this ISA, 
        you will need to complete a new application form before we can accept 
        further investments. <br>
