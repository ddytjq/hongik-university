<H2>How do cosmic strings evolve?</H2>

<P>The evolution of cosmic string network is the relatively complicated
result of only three rather simple and fundamental processes:&nbsp;<A HREF="#expansion">cosmological
expansion</A>, <A HREF="#intercom">intercommuting &amp; loop production</A>,
and <A HREF="#radiation">radiation.</A> We describe each one of them below...<BR>
<BR>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="expansion"></A>Cosmological expansion</H3>

<P><BR>
The <A HREF="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/bb_pillars.html">overall
expansion</A> of the universe will `stretch' the strings, just like any
other object that is not gravitationally bound. You can easily undertand
this through the well-known analogy of the expanding balloon. If you draw
a line of the surface of the balloon and then blow it up, you will see
that the length of your `string' will grow at the same rate as the radius
of the balloon.</P>

<H3><BR>
<A NAME="intercom"></A>Intercommuting &amp;&nbsp;loop production</H3>

<P><BR>
Whenever two long strings cross each other, they exchange ends, or `intercommute'
(case (a)&nbsp;in the figure below). We had already encountered this apparently
strange fact when we discussed the strings in the context of <A HREF="cs_top.html#condmat">nematic
liquid crystals</A>. In particular, a long string can intercommute with
itself, in which case a loop will be produced (this is case (b) below).<BR>

<P><BR>
Belowyou can see two movies providing numerical evidence for the intercommuting
process. The first one shows a full three-dimensional simulation of the
intercommuting of two cosmic strings....</P>

<BR>
</P></CENTER>

<H3><BR>
<A NAME="radiation"></A>Radiation</H3>

<P><BR>
Both long cosmic strings and small loops will emit radiation. In most cosmological
scenarios this will be <B>gravitational radiation</B>, but electromagnetic
radiation or axions can also be emitted in some cases (for some specific
phase transitions). Here is a single, oscillating piece of string...</P>

<CENTER><P><A HREF="movies/cs_osc.mpg"><IMG SRC="images/cs_osc.gif" SGI_SETWIDTH SGI_SETHEIGHT SGI_FULLPATH="/local/euterpe/epss/public_html/cosmology/images/cs_osc.gif" HEIGHT=295 WIDTH=422></A></P></CENTER>

<H5 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Three-dimensional simulation of an oscillating cosmic
string (actually a global string). The motion of the string which is held
at either end is periodic, but the amplitude slowly decays because of radiation
as shown below (R. Battye &amp; E. P. Shellard).</I></H5>

<P><BR>
... and here you can see the radiation that is being emitted. Note that
this is a cross section through the string, that is, in this movie the
string is perpendicular to the screen.</P>

<CENTER><P><A HREF="movies/cs_osc_rad.mpg"><IMG SRC="images/cs_osc_rad.gif" SGI_SETWIDTH SGI_SETHEIGHT SGI_FULLPATH="/local/euterpe/epss/public_html/cosmology/images/cs_osc_rad.gif" HEIGHT=304 WIDTH=305></A></P></CENTER>

<H5 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Radiation fields from the oscillating shown above.
A transverse cross-section of the fields has been made at the point of
maximum amplitude. Notice the four lobes of the radiation (a quadrupole
pattern) which is characteristic of all cosmic string radiation (R. Battye
&amp; E. P. Shellard)</I></H5>

<P>The effect of radiation is much more dramatic for loops, since they
lose all their energy this way, and eventually disappear. Here you can
see what happens in the case of two interlocked loops. This configuration
is unlikely to happen in a cosmological setting, but it is nevertheless
quite enlightening. Notice the succession of compicated dynamic processes
before the loop finally disappears!</P>

<H5 ALIGN=CENTER><I>The intersection, unification and decay of two interlocked
loops . Note that when the united loop finally collapses to a point and
annhilates, there is sufficient energy available to create a `transient'
new loop, just as in the long-string intercommuting case above (R. Battye
&amp; E. P. Shellard)</I></H5>

<P>If you are not able to see the movie, here are some selected snapshots...</P>

<H5 ALIGN=CENTER><I>Snapshots from the two loop decay process.</I></H5>

<P><BR>
</P>

<H2>So, what's the overall effect?</H2>

<P>After formation, an initially high density string network begins to
chop itself up by producing small loops. These loops oscillate rapidly
(relativistically) and decay away into gravitational waves. <I>The net
result is that the strings become more and more dilute with time as the
universe expands.</I> From an enormous density at formation, mathematical
modelling suggests that today there would only be about 10 long strings
stretching across the observed universe, together with about a thousand
small loops!</P>

<P>In fact the network dynamics is such that the string density will eventually
stabilize at an exactly constant level relative to the rest of the radiation
and matter energy density in the universe. Thus the string evolution is
described as <B>`scaling' </B>or scale-invariant, that is, the properties
of the network look the same at any particular time<I> t </I>if they are
scaled (or multiplied) by the change in the time. This is schematically
represented below:</P>

<CENTER><P><A NAME="scaling"></A><IMG SRC="images/cs_scaling.gif" SGI_SETWIDTH SGI_SETHEIGHT SGI_FULLPATH="/local/euterpe/epss/public_html/cosmology/images/cs_scaling.gif" HEIGHT=301 WIDTH=539></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>Scale-invariant evolution of a cosmic string
network. The network looks exactly the same (in a statistical sense) if
it is re-scaled relative to the horizon (which grows in proportion to the
time t multiplied by the speed of light c).</FONT></I></B></P></CENTER>

<P>In order to obtain a more detailed description of the evolution, however,
it is necessary to use <A HREF="cs_evol.html">high -resolution numerical
simulations</A>.</P>
