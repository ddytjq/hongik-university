Assumptions</A>

<P>
<DIV><A NAME="assumption.n"><B>Assumption  1</B></A> &nbsp; 
Only some of the atoms in a molecular machine are involved in an operation.

For example, if the flip of a tyrosine ring
in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor
has no function [<A
 HREF="node24.html#Karplus1986">Karplus &amp; McCammon, 1986</A>]
or effect on sphere sharpness or placement
then <I>d</I><SUB><I>space</I></SUB> is effectively less than 3<I>n</I> - 6.
In this paper <I>d</I><SUB><I>space</I></SUB> is taken to refer only to
the number of spatial degrees of freedom involved in the operation.
Even with the restriction of equation (<A HREF="node4.html#eqn.ds.real">2</A>),
<I>d</I><SUB><I>space</I></SUB> can still be large in a typical
macromolecule, so (<A HREF="node16.html#eqn.Cy">38</A>) still applies.

<P>
Most protein dynamics are well modeled
with just the locations of the nuclei, and quantum corrections
are small at 300<IMG

If quantum effects were used in a machine operation,
<I>d</I><SUB><I>space</I></SUB> would be given by the number of
independent parameters that are required to describe the system.

<P>
Two independent ``pins'' need not have the same importance to the organism.
If we use information content as a measure of ``importance'',
we can see that the ``importance'' of various bases in a binding
site is strongly dependent on the position in the site
[<A
 HREF="node24.html#Schneider1986">Schneider <EM>et al.</EM>, 1986</A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#Schneider1988">Schneider, 1988</A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#Schneider.Stephens1990">Schneider &amp; Stephens, 1990</A>].
Likewise, one pin in a lock could have more ``importance''
than other pins if it used more distinct levels than the others.

<P>
</DIV><P></P>

<P>
<P>
<DIV><A NAME="assumption.independence"><B>Assumption  2</B></A> &nbsp; 
The important parts of the molecular machine move independently. 
In the lock-and-key analogy, this assumption is that
the pins of the lock move independently of one another.
However, it is possible for one part of a molecular machine to
affect the motions of its neighbors.
In communications there are similar phenomena [<A
 HREF="node24.html#Shannon1949">Shannon, 1949</A>].
Regions of a television picture are correlated to one another, and
each frame is often similar to the next.
Shannon pointed out that this simply reduces the number of independent
parameters.
So correlations between parts of the machine effectively reduce the
dimensionality by confining the machine to surfaces in <I>Y</I> space.
If the dimensionality is reduced, then
<I>C</I><SUB><I>y</I></SUB> remains the upper bound, as can be seen from equations (<A HREF="node16.html#eqn.Mz">37</A>)
and (<A HREF="node16.html#eqn.Cy">38</A>).

<P>
This assumption has a biological rational.  It asserts that the components of a
molecular machine can become independent through natural selection.  For
example, where it is important that two successive amino acids
in the chain of a protein move independently
to satisfy the protein's function, mutational insertions in the
gene for the protein
will confer a selective advantage.  Eventually a flexible segment may evolve
that allows the amino acids to move nearly independently.

<P>
The linear structure of binding sites on nucleic acids
suggests that parts of the binding site recognizers
could operate independently in the same sense that lock pins are
independent.
Three lines of evidence support this idea.
First, it is possible to train a linear perceptron to
identify ribosome binding sites and splice junctions
[<A
 HREF="node24.html#StormoPerceptron1982">Stormo <EM>et al.</EM>, 1982</A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#Nakata1985">Nakata <EM>et al.</EM>, 1985</A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#Brunak1990">Brunak <EM>et al.</EM>, 1990</A>].
Second, it is possible to predict the amount of
translational initiation using a linear model of the 12 bases preceding
and including the first base of
the initiation codon of ribosome binding sites
[<A
 HREF="node24.html#Childs1985">Childs <EM>et al.</EM>, 1985</A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#Stormo1986">Stormo <EM>et al.</EM>, 1986</A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#Barrick.ribosomes1994">Barrick <EM>et al.</EM>, 1994</A>].
There are similar data for the Cro, <IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img96.gif"
 ALT="$\lambda$">
and <EM>lac</EM>
repressor binding sites

 HREF="node24.html#Lehming1990">Lehming <EM>et al.</EM>, 1990</A>].
Third, the contribution of individual amino acids to the
total association free energy between proteins has been found
to be additive in a number of cases [<A
 HREF="node24.html#Horovitz1987">Horovitz, 1987</A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#Horovitz1985">Horovitz &amp; Rigbi, 1985</A>].
The success of these approaches suggests that at least some parts of molecular
machines exhibit independence and that further experimental work may allow us
to map the locations of the ``pins''.

<P>
It is possible that a transformation of the descriptive variables is
required to reveal independence.  For example,
if the transformation involved in
harmonic analysis 
provides a good model for a particular molecular machine

then the modes are guaranteed to be independent, and the
equipartition theorem [<A
 HREF="node24.html#Waldram1985">Waldram, 1985</A>] guarantees that the energy
is evenly distributed over all 3<I>n</I>-6 modes [<A
 HREF="node24.html#Tidor1983">Tidor <EM>et al.</EM>, 1983</A>].
A molecular machine need not use all of these modes.

<P>
The independence assumption has a curious consequence.
Since its components are independent, the machine is modeled as
an <EM>ideal gas</EM> in <I>Y</I> space and a machine operation is represented by the
collapse of this gas.
The entropy decrease is simply the log of the ratio of
the volumes (equation (<A HREF="node16.html#eqn.Mz">37</A>)), as in classical thermodynamics
[<A
 HREF="node24.html#Castellan1971">Castellan, 1971</A>].  
The decrease in entropy of the molecular machine is proportional
to the information it gains.

<DIV><A NAME="assumption.Boltzmann"><B>Assumption  3</B></A> &nbsp; 
The energetics of molecular machine components (``pins'')
are described by a Boltzmann distribution

band-limited white Gaussian noise

in which the velocity of a particle is the sum of many small impacts.
Atomic fluctuations in proteins are well characterized by
Gaussian distributions [<A
 HREF="node24.html#Ichiye1987">Ichiye &amp; Karplus, 1987</A>].

<P>
Shannon considered the case of the channel capacity with an arbitrary
type of noise [<A
 HREF="node24.html#Shannon1949">Shannon, 1949</A>].
He pointed out that white Gaussian noise is the worst possible noise,
and that other kinds of noise exist.
As Shannon noted for communications systems,
the ensemble states of molecular machines are not spherical
when the noise is not white Gaussian.  This is equivalent to changing
the energy function of the ``pins''.
For example, suppose that the energies were
related to the maximum velocities

This may or may not be physically realizable,
but we can use it to illustrate the possible properties of non-Gaussian noise.
The case of <I>m</I> = 2 produces a circle, as in Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="node5.html#fig.fco">3</A>.
This represents Gaussian noise.
If <I>m</I> = 1 then the formula reduces to a line segment in the positive quadrant.
This is reflected around the origin by the absolute value functions,
to produce a ``diamond'' shape, as shown in
Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="node17.html#fig.circlesquare">9</A>.

is a square!
These shapes exceed the area of a circle with the same total energy.
Now consider how these objects could be packed together.
Circles could be packed into a hexagonal array.
In contrast,
the same hexagonal packing of the rounded squares would cause them to overlap,
so circles produce a higher channel capacity.
Since a molecular machine could obtain circles by evolving springs that
move by simple harmonic motion, the <I>m</I> &gt; 2 case could be avoided.
This is why white Gaussian noise, where <I>m</I> = 2, is the worst possible noise.
When <I>m</I> &lt; 2 the area is less than that of a circle.
At <I>m</I> = 1, the shape becomes a diamond and below this the shape is concave
and has cusps.
Since these spiky shapes can be packed more closely than circles,
the capacity can be reduced in the absence of Gaussian noise.
Similar effects occur in higher dimensions and with other force functions.

and the upper bound exceeds the bound given by equation (<A HREF="node16.html#eqn.Cy">38</A>)
[<A
 HREF="node24.html#Shannon1949">Shannon, 1949</A>].
We can see this geometrically from the example given above.
If the shape of the <EM>before</EM> state
is spherical (i.e. the radius is 
<!-- MATH: $\sqrt{P_y+N_y}$ -->

then we obtain the
upper bound of (<A HREF="node17.html#eqn.C.N1">42</A>).

<P>
In this paper we have defined a classical physics
benchmark against which we may examine real systems to see how
well they do.  Can a biological system use quantum effects to circumvent
white Gaussian noise?  By experimentally investigating the capacity of
real molecular machines, it may be possible to answer this question.

<P>
</DIV><P></P>

<P>
<P>
<DIV><A NAME="assumption.equilibrium"><B>Assumption  4</B></A> &nbsp; 
The before state is in equilibrium. 
The shape of the machine ensemble is spherical in the <EM>after</EM> state
because the machine has reached equilibrium with its surroundings
and the ``pins'' have a Boltzmann distribution
(<B>Assumption <A HREF="node17.html#assumption.Boltzmann">3</A></B>).
In some cases
the <EM>before</EM> state is also in equilibrium
because the machine is a ``frustrated'' physical system
[<A
 HREF="node24.html#Shakhnovich1989">Shakhnovich &amp; Gutin, 1989</A>].
For example,
on a time scale far shorter than it takes to find a binding site,
a molecule of
<EM>Eco</EM>RI should come to equilibrium with the surrounding solution.
In contrast, if rhodopsin does not have a ``frustrated'' state,
then one vibrational mode of rhodopsin
might absorb more energy from a photon than the other modes,
so that the ensemble would become an ellipsoid in <I>Y</I> space.
However, of all possible ellipsoids,
a sphere contains the largest possible volume given the constraint
that the energy is constant.
(For an ellipse,

<!-- MATH: ${\left( \frac{x}{a} \right) }^2 + {\left( \frac{y}{b} \right)}^2  = r^2$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="52" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

 ALT="${\left( \frac{x}{a} \right) }^2 + {\left( \frac{y}{b} \right)}^2 = r^2$">,
the area, <IMG
 WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img106.gif"
 ALT="$\pi ab$">,
is maximized when <I>a</I> = <I>b</I>.)
So if the energies are
unequally distributed in the <EM>before</EM> state,
the volume will be smaller
than that given by equations (<A HREF="node14.html#eqn.rbefore">36</A>) and (<A HREF="node9.html#eqn.V">26</A>),
<I>M</I><SUB><I>y</I></SUB> will be decreased (equation (<A HREF="node16.html#eqn.Mz">37</A>)),
and hence the information gain, <I>R</I>,
will be below <I>C</I><SUB><I>y</I></SUB> (equation (<A HREF="node16.html#eqn.Cy">38</A>)).
Thus <I>C</I><SUB><I>y</I></SUB> remains the upper bound.
We call this argument ``The Ellipsoidal Defense''.

<P>
It is advantageous for a molecular machine, such as rhodopsin
or actomyosin, to operate as close
to its capacity as possible, because then it would gain as much information
as possible for a given energy dissipation.
To operate near capacity, the machine must have,
or equilibrate to,
a spherical <EM>before</EM> state.
In other words, the entropy of the
<EM>before</EM> state will tend to be maximized by
evolution,
and the Ellipsoidal Defense is an argument that it is
advantageous to the organism to allow the entropy of the <EM>before</EM>
state to be maximized [<A
 HREF="node24.html#Schneider1986">Schneider <EM>et al.</EM>, 1986</A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#Schneider1988">Schneider, 1988</A>].
Indeed, there is evidence for
``complete thermal relaxation'' in the <EM>before</EM> state
of rhodopsin [<A
 HREF="node24.html#Hurley1977">Hurley <EM>et al.</EM>, 1977</A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#Birge1980">Birge &amp; Hubbard, 1980</A>].
Complete thermal relaxation could easily be obtained by rhodopsin if it enters
a ``frustrated'' state when excited by a photon.
It is possible that this relaxation improves rhodopsin's
capacity to detect light.</DIV><P></P>

<DIV><A NAME="assumption.waste"><B>Assumption  5</B></A> &nbsp; 
None of the power is wasted. 
If only part of <I>P</I><SUB><I>y</I></SUB> is used by the machine to make selections,
while the rest is dissipated directly,
then the rate that the machine gains information, <I>R</I>(bits per operation), would
be lower than the right hand side of equation (<A HREF="node16.html#eqn.Cy">38</A>), and
<I>C</I><SUB><I>y</I></SUB> would remain the upper bound.</DIV><P></P>

<P>
<P>
<DIV><A NAME="assumption.packing"><B>Assumption  6</B></A> &nbsp; 
The after spheres are perfectly packed and do not overlap. 
The <EM>after</EM> spheres could overlap.  This effectively reduces
the number of distinct <EM>after</EM> states <I>M</I><SUB><I>y</I></SUB>, and lowers the
capacity according to equation (<A HREF="node16.html#eqn.Cy">38</A>).
Thus <I>C</I><SUB><I>y</I></SUB> remains the upper bound.

<P>
Sphere overlaps
represent transitions or isomerizations between semi-distinct states of the
machine [<A
 HREF="node24.html#Campbell1985">Campbell <EM>et al.</EM>, 1985</A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#Ichiye1987">Ichiye &amp; Karplus, 1987</A>,<A
 HREF="node24.html#Frauenfelder1988">Frauenfelder <EM>et al.</EM>, 1988</A>].
To see this, consider two <EM>after</EM> spheres that are
so close together that they overlap.
A point which is in the overlap region between the spheres
could be considered to be part of either sphere.
Now recall that each point in <I>Y</I> space represents
a velocity configuration of the machine.
A moment later the machine has moved, and this corresponds
to
a point somewhere else on the sphere.
If the machine starts out on one of the spheres, and is in the
overlap region next, it could easily end up on the other sphere.
Since the other sphere represents a different <EM>after</EM>
state of the machine,
the machine would have two states but they would not be distinct
because the machine would keep switching between them.
The rate that the machine switches states depends
on the volume of the overlap region relative to the size of the spheres.

<P>
These conformational substates may exist in either the <EM>before</EM> or
the <EM>after</EM> machine states.
If the <EM>before</EM> state is broken into several connected conformational
substates,
one can find a machine with a higher capacity by <EM>joining</EM> the substates,
since this increases the volume of the <EM>before</EM> state.
In contrast, if an <EM>after</EM> state is broken into several conformational
substates, a better machine can be found
by <EM>separating</EM> the substates, since
this would increase the number of distinct <EM>after</EM> states and
so increase the capacity of the machine.

<P>
As an example, suppose that an RNA polymerase inserts the four bases at
<I>W</I><SUB><I>s</I></SUB>= 200 operations per second [<A
 HREF="node24.html#Golomb1974">Golomb &amp; Chamberlin, 1974</A>].
Since it performs 
<!-- MATH: $R = \log_2 4 = 2$ -->
<IMG

 ALT="$R = \log_2 4 = 2$">
bits per operation,
it operates at 
<!-- MATH: $W_sR = 400$ -->
<I>W</I><SUB><I>s</I></SUB><I>R</I> = 400bits per second, which we will take to be its capacity.
(See Appendix <A HREF="node23.html#appendix.theory">23</A> for a discussion of various forms of the capacity.)
Now suppose that the temperature is raised,
increasing the thermal noise
and swelling the <EM>after</EM> spheres so that they overlap
(equation (<A HREF="node11.html#eqn.ry.T">32</A>)).
Suppose that A and G become indistinguishable, 
that C becomes indistinguishable from U,
but that the operating rate is not increased significantly by the
temperature increase.
Then the machine performs only 1 bit per operation at a rate of 200
bits per second.
This shows how blurring the distinction between
<EM>after</EM> states decreases the machine's rate of
operation below the machine capacity.
