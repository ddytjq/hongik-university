<H1>Dr. Marten's League (Southern League)</H1>
<H2>Founded: 1894</H2>
<P>Professional football in the South was slow to take hold. Most teams
preferred to remain true to the Amateur principle and local county FAs would not
countenance professionalism in any case. Attempts in 1892 by Woolwich Arsenal
(the first Southern club to turn professional) to interest clubs in a Southern
League floundered due to fears of incurring the wrath of the London FA.
Eventually the Southern League was established in 1894 on the initiative of
Millwall Athletic.</P>
<H3>Founder Members</H3>
<P>Division One: Chatham, Clapton, Ilford, Luton Town, Millwall Athletic,
Reading, Royal Ordnance Factories, 2nd Scots Guards and Swindon Town.
Southampton St. Mary's replaced 2nd Scots Guards who withdrew before the
competion commenced.</P>
<P>Division Two: Bromley, Chesham, Maidenhead, New Brompton, Old St. Stephen's,
Sheppey United and Uxbridge.</P>
<H2>Area Covered</H2>
<P>The Dr. Marten's League covers the South and Midlands. The boundary to the
North is roughly between Stoke and Stafford in the West and Boston and King's
Lynn in the East. Clubs in and around the Greater London area play in the
<A HREF="isth.html">Ryman League</A> in general. Where possible clubs relegated
from the Conference are placed in the league of their choice which is normally
the one in which they previously played.</P>
<H2>Structure</H2>
<P>3 divisions, 66 clubs<BR><A HREF="#dmlp">Premier Division</A> (22 clubs)<BR><A
HREF="#dmlm">Midland &amp; West Division</A> (22 clubs) and <A HREF="#dmls">Southern
&amp; East Division</A> (22 clubs)</P>
<P>Until 1920 the Football League consisted predominantly of clubs from the
Midlands and the North with only a handful of the very strongest Southern clubs.
All the other major Southern clubs played in the Southern League and the
standard of the league was roughly equivalent to the Second Division of the
Football League. The standard of the league was most amply demonstrated in 1901
when Tottenham Hotspur became the first, and to date only, club from outside the
Football League/FA Premier League to win the FA Cup. Merger with the Football
League was discussed on several occassions and was eventually agreed upon in
1920 when the First Division clubs of the Southern League were admitted en masse
to the Football League. The Southern League continued in two sections with the
reserve teams of the former First Division clubs forming the bulk of the
members. The number of reserve teams gradually reduced in the years leading up
to the Second World War as they dropped out and were replaced by the first teams
of ambitious non-league clubs. When football  restarted after the war the
Southern League reformd as a single division of mainly first teams, initially of
18 clubs quickly rising to 24 before settling at 22 for most of the '50s. A
large influx of new members in 1958 led to the creation of two equal divisions,
this arrangement only lasted for a season after which the top 11 clubs from each
division formed a new Premier Division and the remainder were placed in Division
One. When the
<A HREF="conf.html">Alliance Premier League</A> was formed in 1979 the Southern
League provided 13 of the founder members. Several clubs were also transferred
to the <A HREF="unibond.html">Northern Premier League</A> to compensate for
that league's loss of clubs to the APL. The remaining Premier Division and First
Division clubs formed two new regional divisions, a Southern Division of 24
clubs and a Midland Division of 22 clubs. The winners of each section were both
eligible for promotion to the APL (subject to having suitable facilities) and
played off against each other for the Southern League championship. There was a
further change in 1982 when one of the promotion places to the APL was given to
the <A HREF="isth.html">Isthmian League</A> and the Premier Division was
re-instated with 20 clubs. Later this was increased to 22 clubs. From 1999-2000
the boundaries of the two regional divisions have been re-aligned and they have
been renamed 'Midland &amp; West' and
'Southern &amp; East'.</P>

<P>It is assumed that having resigned from the League, Hastings Town will be
removed from the Premier Division in accordance with League rules. Since they
later rescinded their resignation, they are likely to be offered a place in the
Southern Division at the League's AGM on June 12th. The latest rumours (early
June) is of a takeover by St. Leonard's Stamcroft.</P>
