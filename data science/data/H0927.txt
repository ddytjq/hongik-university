                <hr><h4><i>Transformation and degradation processes differ; but the fate of many
                contaminants, from petroleum hydrocarbons to radionuclides, is influenced by
                microbial activity.</i></h4><hr>
                Over the past two decades, it has become widely accepted that microorganisms, and
                to a lesser extent plants, have the ability to transform and degrade many types of
                contaminants.  Transformation and degradation processes differ depending on
                physical environment, microbial communities, and contaminants; but the fate of
                many contaminants, from petroleum hydrocarbons to radionuclides, is influenced by
                microbial activity.  These processes form the foundation for bioremediation both
                natural bioremediation, which relies on intrinsic rates and processes, and accelerated
                bioremediation, which seeks to enhance desirable processes through the addition of
                amendments.<p>
                Microorganisms degrade or transform contaminants by a variety of mechanisms. 
                Petroleum hydrocarbons, for example, are converted to carbon dioxide and water or
                are used in generating new cells by aerobic bacteria.  In this case, microorganisms
                use the petroleum hydrocarbons as a primary food source.  Chlorinated
                hydrocarbons can be degraded, but the degradation takes place as a
                secondary or co-metabolic process.  Enzymes created during aerobic
                utilization of carbon sources such as methane fortuitously degrade the
                chlorinated solvents.  Under anaerobic conditions, chlorinated solvents
                such as trichloroethylene (TCE) are degraded through a sequence of
                steps, where some of the intermediary by-products may be more
                hazardous than the parent compound (e.g., vinyl chloride).  Inorganic
                contaminants such as nitrate can also be degraded by microbial activity
                and plants.  Depending on environmental conditions, nitrate can be
                converted to nitrogen gas or used as a nutrient to support cell
                production.<p>
                While metals and radionuclides cannot be degraded by biological
                activity, they can be transformed from one chemical form to another or
                transported from soils to above- and below-ground plant tissues.  Fungi,
                for example, can convert dissolved arsenic and selenium to gaseous
                forms through methylation.  Bacteria similarly have been shown to
                reduce mercury to its volatile elemental form.  Bacteria have been shown
                to change the oxidation state of some heavy metals (e.g., chromium,
                selenium, and mercury) and radionuclides (e.g., uranium) by using them
                as electron donors or acceptors.  In some cases, the solubility of the
                altered species will increase and consequently the altered species will
                more easily be flushed from the geologic host material.  In other cases,
                the opposite will occur, and the contaminant will be immobilized <i>in
                situ</i>.  The immobilization (or sequestration) of chemical and
                radioactive contaminants through <i>in situ</i> biological processes
                can make an important contribution to site remediation.<p>
                <hr><h4><i>Because of the impressive capabilities of microorganisms
                to degrade and transform contaminants, systematic attempts to
                understand and harness these capabilities will provide tremendous
                benefits.</i></h4><hr>
                In light of the impressive capabilities of microorganisms and plants to
                degrade and transform contaminants, systematic attempts to understand
                and harness these abilities should provide tremendous benefits.  In fact,
                these remediation ideas are not new: they have provided the foundation
                for many <i>ex situ</i> waste treatment processes (including sewage
                treatment) and a host of <i>in situ</i> bioremediation methods that are
                in practice today  (Hinchee et al., 1994).  For example, bioremediation
                technologies such as bioventing and land farming have become accepted
                practice for remediating petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soils and sediments
                (CISB, 1993).  In addition, several projects, including one at DOE's Savannah River
                Site, have demonstrated that TCE can be co-metabolically degraded <i>in situ</i> 
                by providing methane as a carbon source.  Explosives and polychlorinated biphenyls
                (PCBs) have been biodegraded in field-scale experiments (Harkness et al., 1993). 
                Bacterial transformation and immobilization of trace metals such as selenium also
                have been implemented on a limited basis (Benson et al., 1993).  Technologies to
                promote volatilization and dissipation of selenium have been demonstrated in
                surface water and soils (Frankenberger and Benson, 1994).<p>  
                Over the last decade, progress has been made in expanding the number and type of
                contaminants to which bioremediation can be applied. Significant progress has also
                been made in the number of practical methods for implementing <i>in situ</i>
                bioremediation.  For example, alternative strategies have been developed for
                delivering chemical additives, such as oxygen.  Chemical additives for increasing the
                bioavailability of recalcitrant organics have been identified.  Techniques such as
                hydrofracturing have been developed for improved delivery of nutrients or
                microorganisms in low-permeability geologic media.  In addition, methods have
                been developed for creating passive treatment systems such as biofilters (Taylor et
                al., 1993).  Novel concepts for using microbially produced biopolymers as <i>in
                situ</i> plugging agents have also been explored (Li et al., 1994).  These advances
                are important steps towards establishing bioremediation as one of the viable
                solutions for <i>in situ</i> remediation of contaminant mixtures in a wide range
                of complex environments.  And of great importance, data are now available that can
                                demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of bioremediation in comparison to physical and chemical
                remediation methods (Saaty and Booth, 1994; Wijesinghe et al., 1992; Atlas,
                1995).<p>

                NABIR will build on all recent activities and advances in bioremediation and will
                focus on filling existing knowledge gaps. As described in the next section,
                significant work must be done to build a more robust scientific foundation to
                support widespread application of bioremediation, especially of contaminant
                mixtures, metals, and radionuclides.  In addition, NABIR will identify the ethical,
                legal, and social impacts that must be addressed before natural and accelerated
                bioremediation at DOE facilities is acceptable to both the public and the regulatory
                authorities.<p>
