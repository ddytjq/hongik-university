      <h1 align="center"><a name="About Itana">About Itana</a></h1>
      <p align="left">Itana is a multiplayer only 2D space shooter. In some ways 
        the game is like Star Control 2 Melee, in the way that you control a single 
        ship, and ships have special abilities. Some people have said the game 
        reminds them of Subspace, a game that is free now -- but I've never played 
        it.</p>
      <h2 align="center">Features</h2>
      <p align="center">800x600 16bit graphics<br>
        Internet/LAN multiplayer<br>
        Windows and Linux support<br>
        Open-join client/server network (like Quake/Half-Life)<br>
        And as usual, sound effects and graphics eye candy.</p>
      <h1 align="center"><a name="Storyline">Storyline</a></h1>
      <p align="left">Four alien races fight for domination 
        over a newly discovered planet in a distant solar system, which has the 
        highest quantities of bollium ever discovered. Bollium is the main material 
        used to fuel the space fold engines for their ships.</p>
      <p align="left">The zylex discovered the planet first, 
        but the humans just a few days later discovered the planet before a zylex 
        mining colony could be set up. A week later a human colonization ship 
        folded into the system to find out that a zylex colony ship was in orbit 
        already surveying possible landing locations!!!</p>
      <p align="left">For the last 20 years the four known 
        races: humans, zylex, ornons, and alsetti have been at a cautious peace, 
        in the aftermath of a huge war, in which the races were all so evenly 
        matched that no one gained a real foothold on any of the others. The human 
        central government, the United Planets, did not want to start another 
        war. A galactic meeting was called on the UP headquarters starbase orbiting 
        the human homeworld, Earth.</p>
      <p align="left">The four races decided that they did 
        not want to start another war, after coercing the warlike ornons, who 
        as usual wanted to stupidly blast away any thing, ship or asteroid or 
        whatnot in their path and wanted to start a new war. The wise alsetti 
        proposed that all races could share the planet and an interspecies colony 
        would be set up there. The arrogant humans and the warlike ornons refused 
        to share the planet. Instead, the zylex proposed that all races send a 
        transforming ship to the new, still unnamed solar system. Upon defolding, 
        the ship would transform into a fully automated base of operations, and 
        launch a single piloted fighter, which would engage the other races. The 
        winner would have undisputed control of the planet. The ornons were eager 
        to fight and so agreed. The humans were convinced that they could win 
        this fight and so agreed. The zylex thought their superior technology 
        would come out on top of this battle and so agreed. The alsetti, who did 
        not wish to fight almost declined to the idea and thought about letting 
        the other races have the planet but decided that they badly needed the 
        fuel and so reluctantly agreed.</p>
      <p align="left">At the end of the galactic conference 
        the races brought up the point that the planet had not been named yet. 
        They discussed this topic and it was a matter of irony that the planet 
        was named after the Alsetti's delegate's daughter, being as modest as 
        they are. The races then agreed on a month to prepare for the battle that 
        was ahead of them.</p>
      <p align="left">After a month the four races defolded 
        in the new star system and chose their orbits around the planet. As was 
        decided a single piloted ship came out of the new base. Each race chose 
        its best fighter design and its best pilot. The zylex and humans decided 
        to risk the battle with new designs that were quickly put together. The 
        designs were untested but used state of the art technology. The alsetti 
        used their traditional, proven design. The ornons used the only ship design 
        that was intelligently built enough to face the other fighters one-for-one 
        (although some doubt the design is actually the ornons' but instead designed 
        by a human firm, which was heavily paid in secret by the ornons. This 
        is only a rumor, however).</p>
      <p align="left">Each race was very wary of this battle. 
        The wise alsetti commander was especially wary of the battle. She thought, 
        given the events in the past, would each race REALLY stick to their pact? 
        Would the other races simply let this simple battle decide everything 
        and then allow the one race sole control over the largest known deposit 
        of bollium in the galaxy?! She decided to prepare their fleets and increase 
        military production just in case. Can the others be trusted? Only time 
        will tell.</p>
      <h1 align="center"><a name="The Races">The Races</a></h1>
      <h2 align="center">Humans</h2>
      <p align="center"><img
src="ships/humship.gif" width="32" height="32"><img
src="ships/humbase.gif" width="96" height="96"></p>
      <p align="left">The humans always think they can survive and win the fight. 
        To some extent their arrogant belief has some truth to it. The well-balanced 
        and adaptable humans, although somewhat weak in comparison to the other 
        races have found ways to survive situations that the other races thought 
        were impossible to survive in.</p>
      <p align="left">The human ship uses an ultra-high speed machinegun array 
        as its primary weapon. The human ship can cloak, appearing translucent 
        while it is firing and completely dissapears when doing nothing. Other 
        players can see the thrust comming out of the cloaked ship.</p>
      <h2 align="center">Zylex</h2>
      <p align="center"><img
src="ships/zylship.gif" width="32" height="32"><img
src="ships/zylbase.gif" width="96" height="96"></p>
      <p align="left">The zylex are the most ingenious and technological known 
        race in the galaxy. They were the first ones to discover that by folding 
        space-time they could travel huge distances in just a matter of days. 
        Their ships have the best propulsion systems but their military prowess 
        is much less glamorous.</p>
      <p align="left">The zylex make the fastest ships in the galaxy. A laser 
        serves as the primary weapon of this ship, and as a special ability they 
        can travel through asteroids without injury, a system that was developed 
        when it was discovered that Zylex pilots flew so fast they could not avoid 
        many obstacles.</p>
      <h2 align="center">Alsetti</h2>
      <p align="center"><img
src="ships/alsship.gif" width="32" height="32"><img
src="ships/alsbase.gif" width="96" height="96"></p>
      <p align="left">The alsetti are considered by the other races to be the 
        wisest and the most conservative, and although they stick strongly to 
        tradition, their tradition is much more open, flexible, and less discriminatory 
        than the other races'. For example they do not discriminate based on gender 
        (women roughly equal men in the armed forces). They are usually withdrawn 
        and shy, and would rather have peace than fight. But even they know that 
        sometimes fighting is inevitable and have developed a strong military 
        capable of keeping intruders out although not as capable of invading.</p>
      <p align="left">The alsetti ship has the infamous alsetti blaster as its 
        main weapon. Its secondary weapon is the parabolt that paralizes an enemy 
        ship for a short time.</p>
      <h2 align="center">Ornons</h2>
      <p align="center"><img
src="ships/ornship.gif" width="48" height="48"><img
src="ships/ornbase.gif" width="96" height="96"></p>
      <p align="left">The ornons are the most belligerent of the races, and also 
        the stupidest. Their solution to everything is to destroy it, and the 
        other races have a hard time of convincing the ornons of anything else. 
        They have the strongest firepower in the universe, but being as stupid 
        as they are their only tactic of a frontal assault makes them extremely 
        predictable and even easier to destroy.</p>
      <p align="left">Because their ship is so slow they mounted four guns in 
        four different directions on this ship. At the front of the ship the ornons 
        have mounted a plasma bolt cannon, the most devastating weapon in the 
        known universe.</p>
      <h1 align="center"><a name="Gameplay">Gameplay</a></h1>
      <p align="left">The game starts with 2 or more stations in orbit around 
        the planet at random distances. The stations will orbit around the planet 
        at different speeds according to their distance. This will encourage the 
        players to change who they fight against when two stations come close.</p>
      <p align="left">The fighters that launch have the capability to fight and 
        survive totally on their own, however when they fight they take a large 
        amount of energy, faster than their small bollium reactor can usually 
        supply. Each fighter starts will a large pool of energy, which will slowly 
        regenerate after time, about as fast as the engines can burn it, so a 
        ship will not gain much extra energy while moving (and therefore would 
        have to stop to regenerate at any significant rate). When a fighter gets 
        low on energy it can dock with the automated station which will &quot;refuel/reenergize&quot; 
        the ship.</p>
      <p align="left">The shields, engines, energy weapons, and afterburners all 
        use energy. Engines, weapons, and afterburners draw from the main battery, 
        but the shields use a separate battery, to which the pilot can move energy 
        freely between the batteries. All ships also have armor which does not 
        regenerate (although the humans have the special ability to mend their 
        ship outside of base using nanotechnology).</p>
      <p align="left">The goal of the game is to destroy the other fighters, gaining 
        points when players kill other players. The fighter will always resurrect 
        at the base.</p>
      <p align="left">Orbiting asteroids and the planet will be obstacles for 
        the ships. Gravity in the asteroid fields are insignificant, but if a 
        fighter gets close to the planet it will need to be careful as not to 
        enter the atmosphere and burn up. Asteroids are unfortunately too big 
        and strong to be destroyed by the fighters (otherwise a multiplayer game 
        would run out of asteroids really fast).</p>

      <h1 align="center"><a name="System Requirements">System 
        Requirements</a></h1>
      <p align="center">Itana will not require much computing power compared to 
        today's standards. It does try to use hardware acceleration where possible, 
        although most systems are capable of reaching 100fps without use of acceleration.</p>
      <p align="center">Reccomended CPU 200mhz or higher.<br>
        Video card capable of 16 bit (hicolor) mode in 800x600 resolution.</p>
      <p align="center">Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2k or Linux is required --<br>
        The Windows version requires DirectX to run, which comes with Win 98/ME/2k 
        already installed.</p>
      <p align="center">The Linux version can use fbcon, X windows, DGA1/2, svgalib.</p>
      <p align="center">Network play will require a 28k modem or higher. Note 
        that Itana is multiplayer only. Bots may be added in the future but will 
        not be immediately supported.</p>
      <h1 align="center"><a name="Current Progress">Current Progress</a></h1>
      <p align="center">All 4 of the race's ships and special abilities are in 
        the game. The races have not been gameplay balanced yet and still need 
        some major stat tweaking. If you can help test, or have comments, please 
        <a
href="../contact.htm">let me know</a>.</p>
      <p align="center">The game works over the internet, but only well for those 
        with a ISDN connection or better at the moment.</p>
      <p align="center">All of the core features of the game besides this are 
        in the game and working well (radar, scoring system, physics/damage engine 
        etc)!</p>
      <p align="center">I need testers to make sure the network code is working 
        well since I haven't been able to test this widely yet.</p>
      <h1 align="center"><a name="Future Releases">Future Releases</a></h1>
      <p align="center">Next up is optimizing the network code. This will probably 
        require a rewrite -- not surprising since this was my first try. Now with 
        the knowledge I have learned I will design the network system properly. 
        I will be working on the rewrite as a stand-alone library for others to 
        use.</p>
      <p align="center">But let me make this clear -- I am not creating another 
        vaporware like PV2143 or JetFight. This project WILL be finished and it 
        WILL be worked on more or less exclusively until completion.</p>
      <h1 align="center"><a name="Download">Download</a></h1>
      <p align="center">This new version includes a lot more features... Some 
        include: Customizable key controls, options menu, improved particle effects 
        and explosions, all four races, ships, and special abilities playable, 
        lessened graphics requirement to 800x600x16, and all new graphics for 
        ships, bases and weapons (thanks Vivienne!).</p>

      <p align="center">What is interesting here? Some highlights of the source 
        code:</p>
      <p align="center">The snowball algorithm for blending dirty rectanges together 
        to reduce flicker when clearing the screen. You can read about it <a href="snowball.txt">here</a>.<br>
        A Video class to abstract the game from Allegro drawing (mostly) and to 
        handle the dirty rectangles outside of game logic.<br>
        A Sound class doing basically the same thing as the Video class, but obviously 
        for sounds ;).<br>
        A network engine using classes as packets -- might be removable.<br>
        Some easily removable classes encapsulating libnet's drivers<br>
        Easily removable porting code when you don't need everything Allegro offers 
        (ItanaPort.cpp)<br>
        Might be able to copy some code from the GUIs to make your own.</p>
      <p align="center">Check <a href="classes.htm">this document</a> for a simple 
        cursory glance over the class hierarchy in Itana (does not include the 
        networking component).</p>

      <p align="center">All dependances are portable to DOS, Windows, and UNIX, 
        therefore my game will run in these environments. Allegro works also under 
        BeOS and Mac (in developement) and only libnet should give you problems 
        in those environments -- but I've not tried it out, though ;).</p>
