                Research directly or indirectly related to bioremediation is funded by several
                programs in the DOE.  While a small fraction of this work is focused on developing
                the scientific foundations for bioremediation, the vast majority is directed towards
                developing new applications for biotechnology.  The total annual budget currently
                expended in DOE on bioremediation and related research is about $40M.  These
                research programs are described briefly below.  An ongoing dialogue will be
                maintained with all of these programs to ensure coordination and timely transfer of
                scientific knowledge among the researchers involved in these efforts.<p>

<hr>
The research programs funded by the Office of Energy Research seek to
develop the scientific foundations underpinning a host of chemical,
physical, and biological processes.  Some of these research programs,
such as OHER's Subsurface Science Program, are directly relevant to
bioremediation.  Others, such as use of computer modeling to design
molecules known as crown ethers to bind to highly radioactive pollutants
such as cesium and strontium, contribute less directly, but nevertheless
provide important scientific knowledge in specific research areas. 
Examples of indirectly related programs include research on degradation
of biopolymers and physiological mechanisms in extreme environments,
as well as the microbial genome project.<p>
<hr><h4><i>While there is significant effort focused toward
bioremediation in DOE, many research needs are not being addressed by
the current programs.</i></h4><hr>

                <b>Subsurface Science Program:
                Heterogeneity</b><p>
                                This research deals with one of the fundamental problems in implementing
                bioremediation, the variability in microbial populations and environmental
                conditions in the subsurface.  At arid Western sites and at humid Eastern sites, field-oriented research is being directed toward characterization of microbial
                heterogeneity and the relationship of microbial heterogeneity to geochemical and
                physical heterogeneity.  A second stage is examining how this underlying
                heterogeneity affects stimulation of the microbial populations in bioremediation.<p>
                <b>Subsurface Science Program: Bacterial Transport
                </b> <p>
                                This research focuses on basic research applicable to the bioaugmentation approach
                to bioremediation. Basic processes controlling bacterial transport are being
                investigated in the laboratory and in ongoing field experiments at an uncontaminated
                field site where natural physical and chemical heterogeneity are reasonably well
                understood. The coarse-grained, sandy sediments at the site have stringers of high
                iron content, and the hypothesis for the field experiment deals with the effect of the
                iron on bacterial transport.  Microbial characteristics and microbial interactions
                controlling transport are key questions being addressed.<p>
                <b>Subsurface Science Program: Co-Contaminant
                Chemistry </b> <p>
                                This research deals most directly with bioremediation-related issues by addressing
                the increased mobility of radionuclides in the subsurface due to chelation with
                organic matter.  This mobility may be reduced to prevent movement of the
                radionuclides by degradation of the organic chelator or displacement of the
                radionuclides from the chelator.  Issues such as sorption of the radionuclides,
                chelators, and the complex are being addressed.<p>
                <b>Subsurface Science Program: Deep Microbiology
                </b> <p>
                                This research focuses on the deep biosphere, including deep aquifers, sediments and
                lithologies, where <I>in situ </I> bioremediation may be the only feasible
                remediation option.  Emphasis is being given to deep microbial ecology and to the
                origins of microbiota found at depths of hundreds of meters or more.  For origins
                research, the two main hypotheses are the <I>in situ </I> hypothesis that the
                origin of the microorganism is associated with the original depositional
                environment and the transport hypothesis that microorganisms have been
                transported into the current geological environment from elsewhere.  Aspects related
                to bioremediation include survival characteristics of bacteria in the subsurface, long-term and long-distance transport of bacteria, acquisition of microorganisms with
                new degradative and survival capabilities, and enhanced understanding of the
                unusual environmental factors that control the presence and distribution of deep
                microbial populations.<p>
                <b>Basic Energy Sciences: Geosciences Program </b>
                <p>
                                The BES Geosciences Program supports a wide variety of fundamental research in
                geophysics, geochemistry, geomechanics, and subsurface flow and transport.  Many
                of the projects are developing knowledge relevant to bioremediation, including
                subsurface imaging, thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of complex mixtures of
                chemicals, and transport of reactive chemicals in heterogeneous environments.<p>
                <b>Basic Energy Sciences: Chemical Sciences
                Program </b><p>
                                The BES Chemical Sciences Program supports a wide variety of fundamental
                research in combustion, solar photoconversion, catalysis, separation and analysis,
                and fundamental research to support environmental restoration and waste
                management.  Many of these projects may be indirectly related to bioremediation,
                especially those investigating radiochemistry, advanced analytical and spectroscopic
                methods, and major R&D facilities.<p>
                <b>Basic Energy Sciences: Material Sciences
                </b><p>
                                The BES Material Sciences Program supports a wide variety of fundamental
                research in the chemistry of materials, including the chemical and crystalline
                structure of liquids and solids; polymers and organic materials, including
                superconductors, magnetic materials, semiconductors, and conductors; and surfaces,
                interfaces, and surface chemistry.  They also support research in solid-state physics,
                including the mechanical and acoustic properties of liquids and solids, phase
                transition and thermodynamics, and thin films.  Many of these projects are indirectly
                related to bioremediation, especially those involving interfaces and surface chemistry
                and new methods for characterizing materials.<p>
                <b>Basic Energy Sciences: Energy Biosciences
                </b><p>
                                The BES Energy Biosciences Program supports research in energy-related
                microbiology, metabolic diversity, photosynthesis, and plant cell walls.  Many of
                these programs are indirectly related to bioremediation, especially those applicable
                to phytoremediation.<p>
                <h3>ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT</h3>
                
<hr>
Bioremediation-related technology development programs in Environmental
Management are focused on developing or adapting bioremediation technologies for
solving site-specific remediation problems at DOE facilities.  Specific projects
currently under way or recently completed include the following.<p>
                <b>Adsorption/Desorption Processes and
                Bioavailability </b> <p>
                                Research in this area focuses on developing the technology necessary to accelerate
                rates of <I>in situ</I> biological remediation of sorbed contaminants.  Two
                approaches are to use surfactants/biosurfactants to enhance the bioavailability of
                contaminants, and to isolate adhesion-deficient bacteria as a biocatalyst for
                trichloroethylene (TCE) degradation.<p>
                <b>Biomass Remediation </b><p>
                                The goal of this research project is to demonstrate the feasibility of using terrestrial
                and aquatic plants to remediate soils, sediments, and surface waters contaminated
                by heavy metals and radionuclides.  Feasibility is evaluated by investigating the
                accumulation of contaminants in plants grown on contaminated soils relative to the
                concentration of the contaminant in the soil, and by using the Ukrainian
                fractionation separation technology (FST) to establish the distribution of the
                contaminants in the plant biomass.<p>
                <b>PCB Bioremediation </b><p>
                                This research deals with developing and demonstrating a bioremediation technology
                for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contaminated soil and sludge.  General Electric
                Company (GE) has provided a microbial culture that is known to degrade PCBs. 
                The development of new ways to stimulate PCB degradation by this microbial
                culture will ultimately result in complete mineralization of the PCBs.<p>
                <b>Biosorption of Uranium </b> <p>
                                The focus of this research is to develop a biosorbent technology (sorptive biomass)
                that selectively removes uranium or other selected metals present at low
                concentrations in surface or groundwater.  Biosorbents immobilized in permeable
                beads are used in flow-through bioreactors to achieve waste fixation and volume
                reduction (ppm levels reduced to ppb levels).<p>
                <b>Co-Metabolic Techniques for Biodegradation of
                TCE </b> <p>
                                The co-metabolic bioremediation of mixed organics at DOE sites is the focus of this
                research.  Field-scale bioreactors are used to demonstrate degradation of compounds
                not used as a carbon or energy source by microorganisms.  Microorganisms used
                include methanotrophs and pseudomonads which degrade toluene.<p>
                <b><I>In Situ </I> Microbial Filters </b> <p>
                                The goal of this research is to develop and evaluate an <I>in situ </I> microbial
                filter of methanotrophic bacteria to remediate contaminated plumes at their
                expanding boundaries.  Contaminated groundwater that flows through the microbial
                filter will be decontaminated to regulatory limits by the microorganisms, and clean
                water will be produced.<p>
                <b>Vadose Zone Bioremediation of Chlorinated
                Solvents </b><p>
                                The objective of this research is to develop and evaluate the
                effectiveness of various classes of microorganisms to degrade
                chlorinated solvents in groundwater and to test methods to control the
                metabolic activity of multiple populations of microorganisms in the
                subsurface.<p>
                <hr><h4><i>An ongoing dialogue will be maintained with all of these
                programs to ensure coordination and timely transfer of scientific
                knowledge among the researchers involved in these
                efforts.</i></h4><hr>
                <b>Optimization Strategies for <I>In
                Situ </I> Remediation </b><P>
                                The goal of this work is to recommend effective designs of chemical
                delivery, mixing schemes, and strategies for improving <I>in situ </I>
                bioremediation.  This will be accomplished by conducting laboratory
                work, evaluating field data, and investigating processes of solute
                transport and fate.<p>
                                <b>Field Demonstration of <I>In Situ </I>
                Biodegradation of TCE and PCE Using
                Methane </b><p>
                                This project has three approaches to the degradation of TCE and PCE
                using methane.  One approach is to use horizontal wells to inject air or
                an air/methane mixture into soil, which stimulates indigenous
                microorganisms to degrade the TCE and PCE.  Another approach is to
                pump contaminated groundwater through a fermenter containing
                methane.  The indigenous methanotrophic bacteria in the groundwater
                are thus stimulated to degrade the contaminants.  The third approach is
                to use microorganisms already present in the roots of trees and plants
                (rhizospheres containing methanotrophs) to degrade TCE and PCE.<p>
                <b>Biodegradation of Carbon
                Tetrachloride at Hanford </b><p>
                                Studies are being conducted to identify optimal strategies for co-metabolic degradation of carbon tetrachloride, including evaluation of
                acetate, glycerol, methanol, and ethanol as agents for
                biostimulation.<p>
                <b>Bioremoval of Metals with Algae </b><p>
                                Studies are being conducted on the ability of algae to remove metals from water
                while embedded in polyurethane foam.  This bioremoval technology could be used
                to remediate groundwater and surface water impoundments contaminated with heavy
                metals.<p>
                <b>Bioremediation of Petroleum-Contaminated Soil
                in a Prepared Bed </b><p>
                                This full-scale bioremediation system for petroleum-contaminated soil consists of
                a cement trough 400 ft long by 40 ft wide with four cells.  Each cell is being used to
                test different nutrient amendments for stimulating indigenous microbes to degrade
                petroleum contaminants.<p>
                <b><I>In Situ </I> Bioremediation of Groundwater at
                a Sanitary Landfill </b> <p>
                                Air and gaseous nutrient injection to accelerate bioremediation are being
                demonstrated at two sites in a large sanitary landfill.  The groundwater is
                contaminated with chlorobenzenes, vinyl chloride, and trichloroethylene.<p>
                <b>Passive Bioventing of Petroleum-Contaminated
                Vadose Zones </b><p>
                                Demonstrations of barometric pumping (passive gas flow) are being done for vadose
                zones contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons or chlorinated solvents.<p>
                <b>Active Bioventing/Biosparging of Petroleum-Contaminated Vadose Zones </b> <p>
                                Air is being extracted and injected at several sites to demonstrate bioremediation of
                petroleum hydrocarbons in vadose zones.<p>
                <h3>FOSSIL ENERGY</h3>
                
<hr>
DOE's Fossil Energy Program, in concert with the Petroleum Environmental
Research Fund (PERF), has a new program related to bioremediation of
environmental problems associated with the petroleum industry.  Current research
is focused on three areas intrinsic bioremediation, toxicity testing, and bio-barriers.  The intrinsic bioremediation effort is documenting how naturally available
bacteria change soil quality over time in various types of soils and contaminants. 
Toxicity researchers are attempting to assess toxicity of contaminated soils from a
physiological perspective, e.g., considering digestive rather than purely chemical
extraction of toxins from soil, and conducting <I>in vitro </I> testing with human
cells.  Bio-barriers research focuses on enhancing bioremediation by changing
conditions in the path of the contaminant plume, e.g., by creating impermeable
barriers.<p>
Other indirectly related programs include research in bioconversion of coal,
bioprocess engineering to develop new technologies for alcohol fuels and pollution
prevention technology for waste streams, methods of microbially enhancing recovery
from oil reservoirs, and microbial and enzymatic methods to remove sulfur from
petroleum.<p>
<h3>ENERGY EFFICIENCY</H3>

<HR>
DOE's Energy Efficiency Program sponsors two large biotechnology research
programs geared towards pollution prevention and biomass conversion.  The
Alternative Feedstocks Program seeks to identify new feedstocks for biofuels,
including agricultural crop residues, forest products, and municipal solid waste
streams.  The Biofuels Program seeks to develop effective and low-cost methods to
convert cellulose to ethanol, methanol, and biodiesel.<p>
<H3>OFFICE OF CIVILIAN RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT</H3>


<HR>
The Office of Civilian and Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) Yucca
Mountain program has recently initiated investigations to evaluate the influence of
microbial activity on the fate and transport of radionuclides in the geologic
formations surrounding the potential repository horizon.
