As a result of the Internet, people can learn far more than theycould before, and they can learn it much faster. If you are interested in issues thatbear on public policy&#8212;environmental quality, wages over time, motorvehicle safety&#8212;you can find what you need to know in a matter of seconds. If you aresuspicious of the mass media, and want to discuss issues with like-minded people, youcan do that, transcending the limitations of geography in ways that could barely beimagined even a decade ago. And if you want to get information to a wide range ofpeople, you can do that via email and websites; this is another sense in whichthe Internet is a great boon for democracy.</p><p>But in the midst of the celebration, I want to raise a note ofcaution. I do so by emphasizing one of the most striking powers provided by emergingtechnologies: the growing power of consumers to "filter" what they see. As a result ofthe Internet and other technological developments, many people are increasinglyengaged in a process of "personalization" that limits their exposure to topics andpoints of view of their own choosing. They filter in, and they also filter out,with unprecedented powers of precision. Consider just a few examples:</p><p>1. Broadcast.com has "compiled hundreds of thousands of programs soyou can find the one that suits your fancy&#8230;. For example, if you want to seeall the latest fashions from France 24 hours of the day you can get them. If you'refrom Baltimore living in Dallas and you want to listen to WBAL, your hometown station,you can hear it."</p><p>2. Sonicnet.com allows you to create your own musical universe,consisting of what it calls "Me Music." Me Music is "A place where you can listen tothe music you love on the radio station YOU create&#8230;. A place where you canwatch videos of your favorite artists and new artists."</p><p>3. Zatso.net allows users to produce "a personal newscast." Itsintention is to create a place "where you decide what's news." Your task is to tell"what TV news stories you're interested in," and Zatso.net turns that informationinto a specifically designed newscast. From the main "This is the News I Want"menu, you can choose stories with particular words and phrases, or you can selecttopics, such as sports, weather, crime, health, government/politics, and muchmore.</p><p>4. Info Xtra offers "news and entertainment that's important to you,"and it allows you to find this "without hunting through newspapers, radio andwebsites." Personalized news, local weather, and "even your daily horoscope orwinning lottery number" will be delivered to you once you specify what you want and whenyou want it.</p><p>5. TiVo, a television recording system, is designed, in the words ofits website, to give "you the ultimate control over your TV viewing." It does this byputting "you at the center of your own TV network, so you'll always have accessto whatever you want, whenever you want." TiVo "will automatically find anddigitally record your favorite programs every time they air" and will help you create"your personal TV line-up." It will also learn your tastes, so that it can "suggestother shows that you may want to record and watch based on your preferences."</p><p>6. Intertainer, Inc. provides "home entertainment services ondemand," including television, music, movies, and shopping. Intertainer is intended forpeople who want "total control" and "personalized experiences." It is "a new way toget whatever movies, music, and television you want anytime you want on your PC orTV."</p><p>7. George Bell, the chief executive officer of the search engineExcite, exclaims, "We are looking for ways to be able to lift chunks of content off otherareas of our service and paste them onto your personal page so you can constantlyrefresh and update that 'newspaper of me.' About 43 percent of our entire userdata base has personalized their experience on Excite."</p><p>Of course, these developments make life much more convenient and insome ways much better: we all seek to reduce our exposure to uninvited noise. Butfrom the standpoint of democracy, filtering is a mixed blessing. An understandingof the mix will permit us to obtain a better sense of what makes for awell-functioning system of free expression. In a heterogeneous society, such a systemrequires something other than free, or publicly unrestricted, individual choices. On thecontrary, it imposes two distinctive requirements. First, people should be exposedto materials that they would not have chosen in advance. <i>Unanticipatedencounters</i>, involving topics and points of view that people have not sought out and perhapsfind irritating, are central to democracy and even to freedom itself. Second, many ormost citizens should have a range of <i>common experiences</i>. Without sharedexperiences, a heterogeneous society will have a more difficult time addressing socialproblems and understanding one another.</p><p><B>Individual Design</B><BR>Consider a thought experiment&#8212;an apparently utopian dream, that ofcomplete individuation, in which consumers can entirely personalize (or"customize") their communications universe.</p><p>Imagine, that is, a system of communications in which each person hasunlimited power of individual design. If some people want to watch news all thetime, they would be entirely free to do exactly that. If they dislike news, andwant to watch football in the morning and situation comedies at night, that would befine too. If people care only about America, and want to avoid internationalissues entirely, that would be very simple; so too if they care only about New York orChicago or California. If people want to restrict themselves to certain points ofview, by limiting themselves to conservatives, moderates, liberals, vegetarians,or Nazis, that would be entirely feasible with a simple point-and-click. If peoplewant to isolate themselves, and speak only with like-minded others, that isfeasible too.</p><p>At least as a matter of technological feasibility, our communicationsmarket is moving rapidly toward this apparently utopian picture. A number ofnewspapers' websites allow readers to create filtered versions, containing exactlywhat they want, and no more. If you are interested in getting help with the designof an entirely individual paper, you can consult a number of sites, includingIndividual.com and Crayon.net. To be sure, the Internet greatly increases people's abilityto expand their horizons, as millions of people are now doing; but many people areusing it to produce narrowness, not breadth. Thus MIT professor NicholasNegroponte refers to the emergence of the "Daily Me"&#8212;a communications package thatis personally designed, with components fully chosen in advance.</p><p>Of course, this is not entirely different from what has come before.People who read newspapers do not read the same newspaper; some people do not readany newspaper at all. People make choices among magazines based on their tastes andtheir points of view. But in the emerging situation, there is a difference of degreeif not of kind. What <i>is</i> different is a dramatic increase in individualcontrol over content, and a corresponding decrease in the power of general interestintermediaries, including newspapers, magazines, and broadcasters. For all theirproblems, and their unmistakable limitations and biases, these intermediaries have performedsome important democratic functions.</p><p>People who rely on such intermediaries have a range of chanceencounters, involving shared experience with diverse others and exposure to material that theydid not specifically choose. You might, for example, read the city newspaper andin the process come across a range of stories that you would not have selectedif you had the power to control what you see. Your eyes may come across a storyabout Germany, or crime in Los Angeles, or innovative business practices in Tokyo, andyou may read those stories although you would hardly have placed them in your"Daily Me." You might watch a particular television channel&#8212;perhaps you preferChannel 4&#8212;and when your favorite program ends, you might see the beginningof another show, one that you would not have chosen in advance. Reading <i>Time</i>magazine, you might come across a discussion of endangered species in Madagascar,and this discussion might interest you, even affect your behavior, although youwould not have sought it out in the first instance. A system in which you lackcontrol over the particular content that you see has a great deal in common with apublic street, where you might encounter not only friends, but a heterogeneous varietyof people engaged in a wide array of activities (including, perhaps, politicalprotests and begging).</p><p>In fact, a risk with a system of perfect individual control is thatit can reduce the importance of the "public sphere" and of common spaces in general.One of the important features of such spaces is that they tend to ensure thatpeople will encounter materials on important issues, whether or not they have specificallychosen the encounter. When people see materials that they have not chosen, theirinterests and their views might change as a result. At the very least, they willknow a bit more about what their fellow citizens are thinking. As it happens, thispoint is closely connected with an important, and somewhat exotic, constitutionalprinciple.</p><p><B>Public (and Private) Forums</B><BR>In the popular understanding, the free speech principle forbidsgovernment from "censoring" speech of which it disapproves. In the standard cases, thegovernment attempts to impose penalties, whether civil or criminal, on politicaldissent, and on speech that it considers dangerous, libelous, or sexually explicit.The question is whether the government has a legitimate and sufficiently weightybasis for restricting the speech that it seeks to control.</p><p>But a central part of free speech law, with large implications forthinking about the Internet, takes a quite different form. The Supreme Court has alsoheld that streets and parks must be kept open to the public for expressiveactivity.<sup><A HREF=#1>1</A></sup> Governments are obliged to allow speech to occur freely on publicstreets and in public parks&#8212;even if many citizens would prefer to have peace andquiet, and even if it seems irritating to come across protesters and dissidentswhom one would like to avoid. To be sure, the government is allowed to imposerestrictions on the "time, place, and manner" of speech in public places. No one has a rightto use fireworks and loudspeakers on the public streets at midnight. But time,place, and manner restrictions must be both reasonable and limited, and governmentis essentially obliged to allow speakers, whatever their views, to use public propertyto convey messages of their choosing.</p><p>The public forum doctrine serves three importantfunctions.<sup><A HREF=#2>2</A></sup> First, it ensures that speakers can have access to a wide array of people. Ifyou want to claim that taxes are too high, or that police brutality againstAfrican Americans is common, you can press this argument on many people who mightotherwise fail to hear the message. Those who use the streets and parks are likely tolearn something about your argument; they might also learn the nature and intensity ofviews held by one of their fellow citizens. Perhaps their views will be changed;perhaps they will become curious, enough to investigate the question on theirown.</p><p>Second, the public forum doctrine allows speakers not only to havegeneral access to heterogeneous people, but also to specific people, and specificinstitutions, with whom they have a complaint. Suppose, for example, that you believethat the state legislature has behaved irresponsibly with respect to crime orhealth care for children. The public forum ensures that you can make your viewsheard by legislators simply by protesting in front of the state legislature building.</p><p>Third, the public forum doctrine increases the likelihood that peoplegenerally will be exposed to a wide variety of people and views. When you go towork, or visit a park, it is possible that you will have a range of unexpectedencounters, however fleeting or seemingly inconsequential. You cannot easily wall yourselfoff from contentions or conditions that you would not have sought out in advance,or that you would have chosen to avoid if you could. Here, too, the public forumdoctrine tends to ensure a range of experiences that are widelyshared&#8212;streets and parks are public property&#8212;and also a set of exposures to diversecircumstances. In a pluralistic democracy, an important shared experience is in factthe very experience of society's diversity. These exposures help promote understanding andperhaps, in that sense, freedom. And all of these points are closely connected todemocratic ideals.</p><p>Of course, there is a limit to how much can be done on streets and inparks. Even in the largest cities, streets and parks are insistently<i>local</i>. But many of the social functions of streets and parks as public forums areperformed by other institutions, too. In fact, society's general interestintermediaries&#8212;newspapers, magazines, television broadcasters&#8212;can be understood as publicforums of an especially important sort, perhaps above all because they expose peopleto new, unanticipated topics and points of view.</p><p>When you read a city newspaper or a national magazine, your eyes willcome across a number of articles that you might not have selected in advance, and ifyou are like most people, you will read some of those articles. Perhaps you didnot know that you might have an interest in minimum wage legislation, or Somalia,or the latest developments in the Middle East. But a story might catch yourattention. And what is true for topics of interest is also true for points of view.You might think that you have nothing to learn from someone whose view you abhor;but once you come across the editorial pages, you might  read what they have tosay, and you might benefit from the experience. Perhaps you will be persuaded onone point or another. At the same time, the front-page headline or the cover storyin <i>Newsweek</i> is likely to have a high degree of salience for a wide range ofpeople.</p><p>Television broadcasters have similar functions. Most important inthis regard is what has become an institution: the evening news. If you tune intothe evening news, you will learn about a number of topics that you would not havechosen in advance. Because of their speech and immediacy, television broadcastsperform these public forum-type functions more than general interest intermediaries inthe print media. The "lead story" on the networks is likely to have a great dealof public salience; it helps to define central issues and creates a kind of sharedfocus of attention for millions of people. And what happens after the leadstory&#8212;dealing with a menu of topics both domestically andinternationally&#8212;creates something like a speakers' corner beyond anything imagined in Hyde Park. As aresult, people's interest is sometimes piqued, and they might well become curious andfollow up, perhaps changing their perspective in the process.</p><p>None of these claims depends on a judgment that general interestintermediaries are unbiased, or always do an excellent job, or deserve a monopoly overthe world of communications. The Internet is a boon partly because it breaks thatmonopoly. So too for the proliferation of television and radio shows, and evenchannels, that have some specialized identity. (Consider the rise of Fox News, whichappeals to a more conservative audience.) All that I am claiming is that generalinterest intermediaries expose people to a wide range of topics and views and at the same timeprovide shared experiences for a heterogeneous public. Indeed, intermediaries of thissort have large advantages over streets and parks precisely because they tend tobe national, even international. Typically they expose people to questions andproblems in other areas, even other countries.</p><p><B>Specialization and Fragmentation</B><BR>In a system with public forums and general interest intermediaries,people will frequently come across materials that they would not have chosen inadvance&#8212;and in a diverse society, this provides something like a common frameworkfor social experience. A fragmented communications market will change thingssignificantly.</p><p>Consider some simple facts. If you take the ten most highly ratedtelevision programs for whites, and then take the ten most highly rated programsfor African Americans, you will find little overlap between them. Indeed, more thanhalf of the ten most highly rated programs for African Americans rank among theten <i>least</i> popular programs for whites. With respect to race, similar divisions canbe found on the Internet. Not surprisingly, many people tend to chooselike-minded sites and like-minded discussion groups. Many of those with committed views ona topic&#8212;gun control, abortion, affirmative action&#8212;speak mostly with eachother. It is exceedingly rare for a site with an identifiable point of view toprovide links to sites with opposing views; but it is very common for such a site toprovide links to like-minded sites.</p><p>With a dramatic increase in options, and a greater power tocustomize, comes an increase in the range of actual choices. Those choices are likely, inmany cases, to mean that people will try to find material that makes them feelcomfortable, or that is created by and for people like themselves. This is what theDaily Me is all about. Of course, many people seek out new topics and ideas. Andto the extent that people do, the increase in options is hardly bad on balance; itwill, among other things, increase variety, the aggregate amount of information, andthe entertainment value of actual choices. But there are serious risks as well. If diversegroups are seeing and hearing different points of view, or focusing ondifferent topics, mutual understanding might be difficult, and it might be hard for peopleto solve problems that society faces together. If millions of people are mostlylistening to Rush Limbaugh and others are listening to Fox News, problems willarise if millions of other people are mostly or only listening to people and stations withan altogether different point of view.</p><p>We can sharpen our understanding of this problem if we attend to thephenomenon of<i> group polarization</i>. The idea is that after deliberating withone another, people are likely to move toward a more extreme point in the directionto which they were previously inclined, as indicated by the median of theirpredeliberation judgments. With respect to the Internet, the implication is that groupsof people, especially if they are like-minded, will end up thinking the same thingthat they thought before&#8212;but in more extreme form.</p><p>Consider some examples of this basic phenomenon, which has been foundin over a dozen nations.<sup><A HREF=#3>3</A></sup> (a) After discussion, citizens of Francebecome more critical of the United States and its intentions with respect toeconomic aid. (b) After discussion, whites predisposed to show racial prejudice offer morenegative responses to questions about whether white racism is responsible forconditions faced by African Americans in American cities. (c) After discussion,whites predisposed not to show racial prejudice offer more positive responses to the samequestion. (d) A group of moderately profeminist women will become more stronglyprofeminist after discussion. It follows that, for example, after discussion withone another, those inclined to think that President Clinton was a crook will be quiteconvinced of this point; that those inclined to favor more aggressive affirmativeaction programs will become more extreme on the issue if they talk among one another;that those who believe that tax rates are too high will, after talking together,come to think that large, immediate tax reductions are an extremely good idea.</p><p>The phenomenon of group polarization has conspicuous importance tothe current communications market, where groups with distinctive identitiesincreasingly engage in within-group discussion. If the public is balkanized, and ifdifferent groups design their own preferred communications packages, the consequence willbe further balkanization, as group members move one another toward more extremepoints in line with their initial tendencies. At the same time, different deliberatinggroups, each consisting of like-minded people, will be driven increasingly farapart, simply because most of their discussions are with one another.</p><p>Why does group polarization occur? There have been two mainexplanations, both of which have been extensively investigated and are strongly supportedby the data.</p><p>The first explanation emphasizes the role of persuasive arguments,and of what is and is not heard within a group of like-minded people. It is based ona common sense intuition: any individual's position on any issue is(fortunately!) a function, at least in part, of which arguments seem convincing. If your positionis going to move as a result of group discussion, it is likely to move in thedirection of the most persuasive position defended within the group, taken as acollectivity. Of course&#8212;and this is the key point&#8212;a group whose membersare already inclined in a certain direction will offer a disproportionately largenumber of arguments supporting that same direction, and a disproportionately smallnumber of arguments going the other way. The result of discussion willtherefore be to move the group, taken as a collectivity, further in the direction oftheir initial inclinations. To be sure, individuals with the most extreme views willsometimes move toward a more moderate position. But the group as a whole moves, asa statistical regularity, to a more extreme position consistent with itspredeliberation leanings.</p><p>The second mechanism, which involves social comparison, begins withthe claim that people want to be perceived favorably by other group members (andto perceive themselves favorably). Once they hear what others believe, they adjusttheir positions in the direction of the dominant position. People may wish, for example,not to seem too enthusiastic, or too restrained, in their enthusiasm foraffirmative action, feminism, or an increase in national defense. Hence their views mayshift when they see what other people and in particular what other group membersthink.</p><p>Group polarization is a human regularity, but social context candecrease, increase, or even eliminate it. For present purposes, the most important point isthat group polarization will significantly increase if people think of themselves,antecedently or otherwise, as part of a group having a shared identity and a degreeof solidarity. If, for example, a group of people in an Internet discussion group thinkof themselves as opponents of high taxes, or advocates of animal rights, theirdiscussions are likely to move toward extreme positions. As this happens to manydifferent groups, polarization is both more likely and more extreme. Hence significantmovements should be expected for those who listen to a radio show known to beconservative, or a television program dedicated to traditional religious values or toexposing white racism.</p><p>This should not be surprising. If ordinary findings of grouppolarization are a product of limited argument pools and social influences, it stands toreason that when group members think of one another as similar along a salientdimension, or if some external factor (politics, geography, race, sex) unites them,group polarization will be heightened.</p><p>Group polarization is occurring every day on the Internet. Indeed, itis clear that the Internet is serving, for many, as a breeding ground forextremism, precisely because like-minded people are deliberating with one another, withouthearing contrary views. Hate groups are the most obvious example. Consider one extremistgroup, the so-called Unorganized Militia, the armed wing of the Patriot movement,"which believes that the federal government is becoming increasingly dictatorial withits regulatory power over taxes, guns and land use." A crucial factor behind the growthof the Unorganized Militia "has been the use of computer networks," allowingmembers "to make contact quickly and easily with like-minded individuals to tradeinformation, discuss current conspiracy theories, and organize events."<sup><A HREF=#4>4</A></sup>The Unorganized Militia has a large number of websites, and those sites frequently offerlinks to related sites. It is clear that websites are being used to recruit newmembers and to allow like-minded people to speak with one another and to reinforceor strengthen existing convictions. It is also clear that the Internet is playing acrucial role in permitting people who would otherwise feel isolated and move on tosomething else to band together and spread rumors, many of them paranoid andhateful.</p><p>There are numerous other examples along similar lines. A groupcalling itself the "White Racial Loyalists" calls on all "White Racial Loyalists to goto chat rooms and debate and recruit with NEW people, post our URL everywhere,as soon as possible." Another site announces that "Our multi-ethnic United Statesis run by Jews, a 2% minority, who were run out of every country in Europe&#8230;.Jews control the U.S. media, they hold top positions in the Clinton administration&#8230; and now these Jews are in control&#8212;they used lies spread by the mediathey run and committed genocide in our name." To the extent that people are drawntogether because they think of each other as like-minded, and as having a sharedidentity, group polarization is all the more likely.</p><p>Of course we cannot say, from the mere fact of polarization, thatthere has been a movement in the <i>wrong</i> direction. Perhaps the more extremetendency is better; indeed, group polarization is likely to have fueled many movements ofgreat value, including the movement for civil rights, the antislavery movement, themovement for sex equality. All of these movements were extreme in their time, andwithin-group discussion bred greater extremism; but extremism need not be a word ofopprobrium. If greater communications choices produce greater extremism, societymay, in many cases, be better off as a result.</p><p>But when group discussion tends to lead people to more strongly heldversions of the same view with which they began, and if social influences andlimited argument pools are responsible, there is legitimate reason for concern. Considerdiscussions among hate groups on the Internet and elsewhere. If the underlying viewsare unreasonable, it makes sense to fear that these discussions may fuel increasing hatredand a socially corrosive form of extremism. This does not mean that the discussions canor should be regulated. But it does raise questions about the idea that "morespeech" is necessarily an adequate remedy&#8212;especially if people are increasingly able towall themselves off from competing views.</p><p>The basic issue here is whether something like a "public sphere,"with a wide range of voices, might not have significant advantages over a system inwhich isolated consumer choices produce a highly fragmented speech market. The mostreasonable conclusion is that it is extremely important to ensure that people areexposed to views other than those with which they currently agree, that doing soprotects against the harmful effects of group polarization on individual thinking and onsocial cohesion. This does not mean that the government should jail or fine people whorefuse to listen to others. Nor is what I have said inconsistent with approval ofdeliberating "enclaves," on the Internet or elsewhere, designed to ensure thatpositions that would otherwise be silenced or squelched have a chance to develop.Readers will be able to think of their own preferred illustrations. Consider,perhaps, the views of people with disabilities. The great benefit of such enclaves is thatpositions may emerge that otherwise would not and that deserve to play a largerole in the heterogeneous public. Properly understood, the case of "enclaves," ormore simply discussion groups of like-minded people, is that they will improvesocial deliberation, democratic and otherwise. For these improvements to occur, members mustnot insulate themselves from competing positions, or at least any such attempts atinsulation must not be a prolonged affair.</p><p>Consider in this light the ideal of "consumer sovereignty," whichunderlies much of contemporary enthusiasm for the Internet. Consumer sovereignty meansthat people can choose to purchase, or to obtain, whatever they want. For manypurposes this is a worthy ideal. But the adverse effects of group polarization showthat, with respect to communications, consumer sovereignty is likely to produceserious problems for individuals and society at large&#8212;and these problems will occurby a kind of iron logic of social interactions.</p><p>The phenomenon of group polarization is closely related to thewidespread phenomenon of "social cascades." Cascade effects are common on the Internet, and wecannot understand the relationship between democracy and the Internet withouthaving a sense of how cascades work.</p><p>It is obvious that many social groups, both large and small, seem tomove both rapidly and dramatically in the direction of one or another set ofbeliefs or actions.<sup><A HREF=#5>5</A></sup> These sorts of "cascades" often involve the spread of information; infact they are driven by information. If you lack a great deal of privateinformation, you may well rely on information provided by the statements or actions ofothers. A stylized example: If Joan is unaware whether abandoned toxic waste dumpsare in fact hazardous, she may be moved in the direction of fear if Mary seemsto think that fear is justified. If Joan and Mary both believe that fear isjustified, Carl may end up thinking so too, at least if he lacks reliable independentinformation to the contrary. If Joan, Mary, and Carl believe that abandoned toxicwaste dumps are hazardous, Don will have to have a good deal of confidence to rejecttheir shared conclusion.</p><p>The example shows how information travels, and often becomes quiteentrenched, even if it is entirely wrong. The view, widespread in someAfrican-American communities, that white doctors are responsible for the spread of AIDS among AfricanAmericans is a recent illustration. Often cascades of this kind are local, andtake different form in different communities. Hence one group may end up believingsomething and another group the exact opposite, and the reason is the rapidtransmission of one piece of information within one group and a different piece ofinformation in the other. In a balkanized speech market, this danger takes a particularform: different groups may be lead to quite different perspectives, as local cascadeslead people in dramatically different directions. The Internet dramaticallyincreases the likelihood of rapid cascades, based on false information. Of course, low-costInternet communication also makes it possible for truth, and corrections, to spread quickly aswell. But sometimes this happens much too late. In that event, balkanization isextremely likely. As a result of the Internet, cascade effects are more commonthan they have ever been before.</p><p>As an especially troublesome example, consider widespread doubts inSouth Africa, where about 20 percent of the adult population is infected by the AIDSvirus, about the connection between HIV and AIDS. South African President Thabo Mbekiis a well-known Internet surfer, and he learned the views of the "denialists" afterstumbling across one of their websites. The views of the "denialists" are notscientifically respectable&#8212;but to a nonspecialist, many of the claims on their (many) sites seem quiteplausible. At least for a period, Mbeki both fell victim to a cybercascade andthrough his public statements, helped to accelerate one, to the point where manySouth Africans at serious risk are not convinced by an association between HIV andAIDS. It seems clear that this cascade effect has turned out to be deadly.</p><p>I hope that I have shown enough to demonstrate that for citizens of aheterogeneous democracy, a fragmented communications market creates considerabledangers. There are dangers for each of us as individuals; constant exposure to one setof views is likely to lead to errors and confusions, or to unthinking conformity(emphasized by John Stuart Mill). And to the extent that the process makes peopleless able to work cooperatively on shared problems, by turning collections ofpeople into non-communicating confessional groups, there are dangers for society asa whole.</p><p><B>Common Experiences</B><BR>In a heterogeneous society, it is extremely important for diverse peopleto have a set of common experiences.<sup><A HREF=#6>6</A></sup> Many of our practices reflect ajudgment to this effect. National holidays, for example, help constitute a nation, byencouraging citizens to think, all at once, about events of shared importance. Andthey do much more than this. They enable people, in all their diversity, to havecertain memories and attitudes in common. At least this is true in nations where nationalholidays have a vivid and concrete meaning. In the United States, many nationalholidays have become mere days-off-from-work, and the precipitatingoccasion&#8212;President's Day, Memorial Day, Labor Day&#8212;has come to be nearly invisible. Thisis a serious loss. With the possible exception of the Fourth of July, Martin LutherKing Day is probably the closest thing to a genuinely substantive nationalholiday, largely because that celebration involves something that can be treated asconcrete and meaningful&#8212;in other words, it is <i>about</i> something.</p><p>Communications and the media are, of course, exceptionally importanthere. Sometimes millions of people follow the presidential election, or the Super Bowl,or the coronation of a new monarch; many of them do so because of the simultaneous actionsof others. The point very much bears on the historic role of both public forums andgeneral interest intermediaries. Public parks are places where diverse peoplecan congregate and see one another. general interest intermediaries, if they areoperating properly, give a simultaneous sense of problems and tasks.</p><p>Why are these shared experiences so desirable? There are threeprincipal reasons:</p><p>1. Simple enjoyment is probably the least of it, but it is far fromirrelevant. People like many experiences more simply because they are being shared.Consider a popular movie, the Super Bowl, or a presidential debate. For many ofus, these are goods that are worth less, and possibly worthless, if many othersare not enjoying or purchasing them too. Hence a presidential debate may be worthy ofindividual attention, for many people, simply because so many other people considerit worthy of individual attention.</p><p>2. Sometimes shared experiences ease social interactions, permittingpeople to speak with one another, and to congregate around a common issue, task,or concern, whether or not they have much in common with one another. In this sensethey provide a form of social glue. They help make it possible for diverse people tobelieve that they live in the same culture. Indeed they help constitute thatshared culture, simply by creating common memories and experiences, and a sense ofcommon tasks.</p><p>3. A fortunate consequence of shared experiences&#8212;many of themproduced by the media&#8212;is that people who would otherwise see one another asunfamiliar can come to regard one another as fellow citizens, with shared hopes,goals, and concerns. This is a subjective good for those directly involved. But itcan be objectively good as well, especially if it leads to cooperative projects of variouskinds. When people learn about a disaster faced by fellow citizens, for example,they may respond with financial and other help. The point applies internationally as wellas domestically; massive relief efforts are often made possible by virtue of the factthat millions of people learn, all at once, about the relevant need.</p><p>How does this bear on the Internet? An increasingly fragmentedcommunications universe will reduce the level of shared experiences having salience toa diverse group of Americans. This is a simple matter of numbers. When there werethree television networks, much of what appeared would have the quality of a genuinelycommon experience. The lead story on the evening news, for example, would provide a commonreference point for many millions of people. To the extent that choicesproliferate, it is inevitable that diverse individuals, and diverse groups, will have fewershared experiences and fewer common reference points. It is possible, forexample, that some events that are highly salient to some people will barely registeron others' viewscreens. And it is possible that some views and perspectives thatseem obvious for many people will, for others, seem barely intelligible.</p><p>This is hardly a suggestion that everyone should be required to watchthe same thing. A degree of plurality, with respect to both topics and points ofview, is highly desirable. Moreover, talk about "requirements" misses the point.My only claim is that a common set of frameworks and experiences is valuable fora heterogeneous society, and that a system with limitless options, making for diversechoices, could compromise the underlying values.</p><p><B>Changing Filters</B><BR>My goal here has been to understand what makes for a well-functioningsystem of free expression, and to show how consumer sovereignty, in a world oflimitless options, could undermine that system. The point is that awell-functioning system includes a kind of public sphere, one that fosters common experiences,in which people hear messages that challenge their prior convictions, and inwhich citizens can present their views to a broad audience. I do not intend to offer acomprehensive set of policy reforms or any kind of blueprint for the future. In fact,this may be one domain in which a problem exists for which there is no usefulcure: the genie might simply be out of the bottle. But it will be useful to offer a fewideas, if only by way of introduction to questions that are likely to engagepublic attention in coming years.</p><p>In thinking about reforms, it is important to have a sense of theproblems we aim to address, and some possible ways of addressing them. If thediscussion thus far is correct, there are three fundamental concerns from the democraticpoint of view. These include:</p><p>(a) the need to promote exposure to materials, topics, and positionsthat people would not have chosen in advance, or at least enough exposure to producea degree of understanding and curiosity;</p><p>(b) the value of a range of common experiences;</p><p>(c) the need for exposure to substantive questions of policy andprinciple, combined with a range of positions on such questions.</p><p>Of course it would be ideal if citizens were demanding, and privateinformation providers were creating, a range of initiatives designed to alleviatethe underlying concerns. Perhaps they will; there is some evidence to this effect. Newtechnology can expose people to diverse points of view and creates opportunitiesfor shared experiences. People may, through private choices, take advantage ofthese possibilities. But, to the extent that they fail to do so, it is worthwhile to considerprivate and public initiatives designed to pick up the slack.</p><p>Drawing on recent developments in regulation generally, we can seethe potential appeal of five simple alternatives. Of course, different proposals wouldwork better for some communications outlets than others. I will speak here of bothprivate and public responses, but the former should be favored: they are lessintrusive, and in general they are likely to be more effective as well.</p><p><i>Disclosure</i>: Producers of communications might discloseimportant information on their own, about the extent to which they are promoting democraticgoals. To the extent that they do not, they might be subject to disclosurerequirements (though not to regulation). In the environmental area, this strategy hasproduced excellent results. The mere fact that polluters have been asked to disclose toxicreleases has produced voluntary, low-cost reductions. Apparently fearful ofpublic opprobrium, companies have been spurred to reduce toxic emissions on their own. Thesame strategy has been used in the context of both movies and television, with ratingssystems designed partly to increase parental control over what children see. Onthe Internet, many sites disclose that their site is inappropriate for children.</p><p>The same idea could be used far more broadly. Television broadcastersmight, for example, be asked to disclose their public interest activities. On aquarterly basis, they might say whether and to what extent they have providededucational programming for children, free air time for candidates, and closedcaptioning for the hearing impaired. They might also be asked whether they have coveredissues of concern to the local community and allowed opposing views a chance tospeak. The Federal Communications Commission has already taken steps in thisdirection; it could do a lot more. Of course, disclosure is unlikely to be a fullsolution to the problems that I have discussed here. But modest steps in thisdirection are likely to do little harm and at least some good.</p><p><i>Self-Regulation</i>: Producers of communications might engagein<i> voluntary self-regulation</i>. Some of the difficulties in the current speechmarket stem from relentless competition for viewers and listeners, competition thatleads to a situation that many broadcast journalists abhor about theirprofession, and from which society does not benefit. The competition might be reduced via a"code" of appropriate conduct, agreed upon by various companies, and encouragedbut not imposed by government. In fact, the National Association of Broadcastersmaintained such a code for several decades, and there is growing interest in voluntaryself-regulation for both television and the Internet. The case for this approach is thatit avoids government regulation while at the same time reducing some of theharmful effects of market pressures. Any such code could, for example, call for anopportunity for opposing views to speak, or for avoiding unnecessary sensationalism, orfor offering arguments rather than quick soundbites whenever feasible. On television,as distinct from the Internet, the idea seems quite feasible. But perhaps Internetsites could also enter into informal, voluntary arrangements, agreeing to createlinks, an idea to which I will shortly turn.</p><p><i>Subsidy</i>:<b> </b>The government might <i>subsidize speech</i>,as, for example, through publicly subsidized programming or publicly subsidizedwebsites. This is, of course, the idea that motivates the Public BroadcastingSystem. But it is reasonable to ask whether the PBS model is not outmoded. Otherapproaches, similarly designed to promote educational, cultural, and democraticgoals, might well be ventured. Perhaps government could subsidize a "Public.net"designed to promote debate on public issues among diverse citizens&#8212;and tocreate a right of access to speakers of various sorts.<sup><A HREF=#7>7</A></sup></p><p><i>Links</i>:<b> </b>Websites might use links and hyperlinks toensure that viewers learn about sites containing opposing views. A liberal magazine'swebsite might, for example, provide a link to a conservative magazine's website, andthe conservative magazine might do the same. The idea would be to decrease the likelihoodthat people will simply hear echoes of their own voices. Of course many people wouldnot click on the icons of sites whose views seem objectionable; but some peoplewould, and in that sense the system would not operate so differently from generalinterest intermediaries and public forums. Here, too, the ideal situation wouldbe voluntary action. But if this proves impossible, it is worth considering bothsubsidies and regulatory alternatives.</p><p><i>Public Sidewalk</i>: If the problem consists in the failure toattend to public issues, the most popular websites in any given period might offer linksand hyperlinks, designed to ensure more exposure to substantive questions. Under such asystem, viewers of especially popular sites would see an icon for sites thatdeal with substantive issues in a serious way. It is well established that whenever there is alink to a particular webpage from a major site, such as MSNBC, the traffic ishuge. Nothing here imposes any requirements on viewers. People would not be requiredto click on links and hyperlinks. But it is reasonable to expect that manyviewers would do so, if only to satisfy their curiosity. The result would be to createa kind of Internet "sidewalk" that promotes some of the purposes of the publicforum doctrine. Ideally, those who create websites might move in this direction on theirown. To those who believe that this step would do no good, it is worth recallingthat advertisers are willing to spend a great deal of money to obtain brief access topeople's eyeballs. This strategy might be used to create something like a public sphere aswell.</p><p>These are brief thoughts on some complex subjects. My goal has notbeen to evaluate any proposal in detail, but to give a flavor of some possibilities forthose concerned to promote democratic goals in a dramatically changed mediaenvironment.<sup><A HREF=#8>8</A></sup> The basic question is whether it might be possible to create spaces that have someof the functions of public forums and general interest intermediaries in theage of the Internet. It seems clear that government's power to regulate effectivelyis diminished as the number of options expands. I am not sure that any response wouldbe worthwhile, all things considered. But I am sure that if new technologies diminishthe number of common spaces, and reduce, for many, the number of unanticipated,unchosen exposures, something important will have been lost. The most important point is tohave a sense of what a well-functioning democratic order requires.</p><p><B>Beyond Anticensorship</B><BR>My principal claim here has been that a well-functioning democracydepends on far more than restraints on official censorship of controversial ideasand opinions. It also depends on some kind of public sphere, in which a wide range ofspeakers have access to a diverse public&#8212;and also to particularinstitutions, and practices, against which they seek to launch objections.</p><p>Emerging technologies, including the Internet, are hardly an enemyhere. They hold out far more promise than risk, especially because they allowpeople to widen their horizons. But to the extent that they weaken the power of generalinterest intermediaries and increase people's ability to wall themselves off fromtopics and opinions that they would prefer to avoid, they create seriousdangers. And if we believe that a system of free expression calls for unrestrictedchoices by individual consumers, we will not even understand the dangers as such. Whether suchdangers will materialize will ultimately depend on the aspirations, for freedomand democracy alike, by whose light we evaluate our practices. What I have sought toestablish here is that in a free republic, citizens aspire to a system thatprovides a wide range of experiences&#8212;with people, topics, and ideas&#8212;thatwould not have been selected in advance. &#8226;</p><!-----AUTHOR ID------><p><B>Cass R.
