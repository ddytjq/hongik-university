<P><I><BLINK>(Note: Clicking on some of the following images will allow
you to view some nice movies put together from computer simulations, or
better-quality images. Some of these files are very large.)</BLINK></I></P>

<DL>
<DT><FONT SIZE=+2>Why do we need numerical simulations?</FONT></DT>

<P>Because strings are extremely complex non-linear objects. The only rigorous
way to study their evolution and cosmological consequences is therefore
to simulate in on the computer. However, these are very difficult to perform,
and in order to be accurate enough they require extremely long CPU&nbsp;times,
even in computers as powerful as <A HREF="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/cosmos/Public/index.html">COSMOS</A>.
Indeed, there are only two research groups in the world which have accurate
string codes!</P>

<P>Therefore, one of the aims of performing numerical simulations of the
evolution of cosmic string networks is to subsequently use the resulting
information as an input to build (relatively) simpler <B><A HREF="#model">analytic
models</A></B> that reproduce (in an averaged sense) the crucial properties
of these objects.</P>
</DL>

<DL>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>What does the string code do?</FONT></P>

<P>The code we use was originally developed by Bruce Allen and Paul Shellard,
and has recently been upgraded. <I>It has over 20000 lines of C code.</I>
It starts by generating and initial `box of stings' (see below), containing
a configuration of strings such as one would expect to find after a <A HREF="cs_phase.html">phase
transition</A> in the early universe. Then it evolves this initial box,
by using the laws of motion of the strings to determine how it should look
like a bit later (such an interval is called a `timestep').</P>

<P><I>Notice that in this and all other pictures and movies below long
strings are shown in yellow, while small loops have a color code going
from yellow to red according to their size (red loops being the smallest).</I></P>

the displayed box is only a fraction of the total simulation box. (C. Martins
&amp;&nbsp;E. P. Shellard)</FONT></I></B></P></CENTER>

<P>This is then repeated for a very large number of timesteps. The code
then outputs information about the configuration of strings in the box
at each timestep. Additional code and standard software tools are then
used to convert this into a `<I>frame</I>'. Finally, all the frames are
put together in a movie. We have one frame per timestep, but in the <A HREF="#movies">movies</A>
shown below only one of every 10 is used.</P>

<P>At each timestep the code can also calculate and output a very large
number of relevant statistical properties of the network. These are then
put through additional data analysis software, in order to extract information
that is relevant for the subsequent process of analytic <A HREF="#model">model
building</A>.</P>

<P><A NAME="radmat"></A>The code is prepared to run in a number of different
cosmological scenarios. For example, one expects the properties of the
string networks to be quantitatively different at very <A HREF="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/bb_history.html">early
times</A> when the universe was dominated by radiation and relativistic
particles (this is known as the <B>radiation era</B>)...</P>

<CENTER><P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>Stnapshot of a string network in the matter
era (Click for a larger view.) Compare with the radiation case above. Notice
the lower density of both long strings and loops, as well as the lower
`wiggliness' of the former. The box size is again about 2ct. (B. Allen
&amp;&nbsp;E. P. Shellard)</FONT></I></B></P></CENTER>

<P>It is possible to simulate both of these regimes, as well as the transition
between them.We will wxplain the differences between them below. We can
also perform simulations with or without the expansion of the universe,
in order to learn what its effect is on the properties of the strings.</P>

<DT><FONT SIZE=+2>Why do the two boxes above look different?</FONT></DT>

<P>Because the rate at which the universe is expanding is different. At
very early times the energy density of the universe is dominated by <B>radiation
</B>(and relativistic matter) . In this case the universe expands <I>relatively</I>
slowly. On the onther hand, in the later stages, non-relativistic (slowly-moving)
<B>matter</B> dominates the universe. In this case the expansion is relatively
fast. This transition between the two different epochs happens between
1,000 and 10,000 years after the Big Bang.</P>

<P>The change in this rate of expansion does not affect the qualitative
<A HREF="cs_interact.html#scaling">`scaling'</A> evolutionof a string network
that we described <A HREF="cs_interact.html#scaling">previously</A>. However,
it does change the detailed properties of the network. In order to maintain
scaling, a network needs to be diluted at a sufficient rate, and this is
done by the <A HREF="cs_interact.html">three effects</A> we discussed previously:
<A HREF="cs_interact.html#expansion">expansion</A>, <A HREF="cs_interact.html#intercom">intercommutation</A>
and<A HREF="cs_interact.html#radiation"> radiation.</A></P>

<P>In the <B>radiation</B> era the universe expands<I><B> </B>relatively
</I>slowly and the string network is not stretched a great deal. In order
to be diluted at a sufficient rate to maintain `scaling', the network must
chop off a large number of small loops. The poor string stretching and
the extra reconnections required to form loops also result the strings
becoming <B>`wiggly'</B> that is, the strings possess a large amount of
small-scale structures. This has important consequences for string dynamics.
A detailed description of these effects is important if we are to make
<A HREF="#model">quantitative predictions</A> about the <A HREF="cs_lss.html">cosmological
implications</A> of cosmic strings.</P>

<P>In the <B>matter </B>era, the expansion rate is comparatively faster.
The string network is, therefore, considerably stretched, so it is already
`half-way' to maintaining `scaling' . Thus a much smaller loop production
rate is required, and this with its correlation length also growing. The
remainder of the dilution required is achieved through the formation of
small loops (coloured red in the picture below). Understanding string evolution
during the matter epoch from a few thousand years through to the present
day is important for predicting their potential role in <A HREF="cs_lss.html">galaxy
formation</A>.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>How long does the code run for?</FONT></P>

<P>In the past 15 months, we have performed about 90000 CPU hours of cosmic
string network evolution runs on the <A HREF="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/cosmos/Public/index.html">COSMOS</A>&nbsp;supercomputer.
<I>This is about 10 years of real time!</I> A single run typically contains
around ten million points and runs for about 10 weeks of real time using
8 processors.</P>

<P>Each run can have up to ten thousand timesteps, and at each one of them
the code outputs up to about 100Mb of `useful' data. this does not include
other files that are used for checkpointing. <B>These are the largest and
most accurate cosmic string simulations performed to date.</B></P>

<P><A NAME="movies"></A><BLINK><FONT SIZE=+2>And now for the movies!...</FONT></BLINK></P>

<P>Below you can find movies of the evolution of cosmic string networks
in oth the radiation and matter eras. <I>(Note that these files are quite
big!)</I> For each of the two cosmological epochs, there are two movies.
In the first one, <B>the displayed box has a fixed size</B>, so as the
movie proceeds you will see progressively less strings. This is due to
the fact that the universe is <A HREF="cs_interact.html#expansion">expanding</A>,
whereas the box is not.</P>

<P>On the other hand, in the second one <B>the box expands with the comoving
horizon</B>. In this case you will see the strings progressively `falling
into' the box. Nevertheless, you should notice that the number of long
strings in the box remains roughly constant, in agreement with the <A HREF="cs_interact.html#scaling">scaling
hypothesis</A>. This is because the additional length in strings is quickly
<A HREF="cs_interact.html#intercom">converted</A> into small loops.</P>

<P>You should also notice the differences in the network properties in
the radiation and matter eras, as discussed <A HREF="#radmat">above</A>.</P>

<P>&nbsp; <A NAME="model"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>Why are the simulations useful?</FONT></P>

<P>Although the movies are in some sense a nice by-product of the simulation,
they can provide extremely useful insights into the detailed dynamics of
the strings. For example, if you look carefully you will notice that the
formation of loops is actually a <B>two-stage process.</B> First, a long
string produces a relatively large `mother-loop', and then this loop decays
into a number of much smaller `daughter-loops'. This can be seen through
careful analysis of the time evolution of the statistical properties of
the network, but it becomes obvious when one sees a movie of it. <B><BLINK>Question:&nbsp;Can
you estimate how many `daughter-loops' are typically produced by each `mother-loop'?</BLINK></B></P>

<P>When one wants to build an analytic model for cosmic string evolution,
the main goal is to be able to predict how a number of averaged proprerties
of the network evolve in time. Simple examples of such properties are the
<B>number of long strings </B>in a given volume, the <B>average string
velocity</B>, the typical <B>distance between two long strings</B>, and
the <B>number and size of the loops</B> produced by the long strings. Slightly
less obvious ones are the <B>correlation length</B> (the typical distance
over which a long string is roughly straight, before bending into a different
direction), as well as quantities measuring the amount of <B>`wiggles'</B>
that each string has.</P>

<P>Obviously, all this information can be extracted (after some additonal
data processing work) from a simulation. In this way, one can test for
the accuracy of one's favourite analytic model, and obtain valuable clues
about how successful modelling should proceed.</P>

<P>Once one is confident that an adequate analytic model of string evolution
is available, one can use it as a poweful tool to analyse the detailed
cosmological consequences of cosmic strings.</P>
