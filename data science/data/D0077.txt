<h1><center>What is Java?</center></h1>

<h4>&quot;Java is a simple, object-oriented, multi-threaded,
garbage-collected, secure, robust, architecture-neutral,
portable, high-performance, dynamic programming language.&quot;
-- This quote is from Arthur van Hoff, author of the Java
compiler.</h4>

<p>Now, what does he really mean by all that? Java is an exciting
new language that solves some interesting problems that plague
distributed computing environments. Java has the potential to
transform the Internet from an information delivery medium to an
interactive computing environment. </p>

    </tr>

<ul>
    <li><i>Cross Platform:</i> Java is a cross platform language.
        The Java compiler compiles Java source code into
        &quot;bytecodes&quot;. These bytecodes are then
        interpreted by a Java &quot;virtual machine&quot; that is
        written for the processor architecture the program is
        running on. This means that your Java Applet will run on
        any platform that has a Java interpreter. This kind of
        platform independece is essential for a heterogeneous
        platform like the Internet or even corporate Intranets.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
    <li><i>Software Distribution:</i> In the case of applets, the
        Java bytecodes are downloaded at run-time, so the user is
        always getting the most current code. This solves all
        sorts of software distribution nightmares that
        enterprises have traditionally had to contend with.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
    <li><i>Moves processing to the client, and off the server:</i>
        Today, any user interaction with Web pages is done by CGI
        (Common Gateway Interface) scripting, which requires
        resources on the server. Many feel that this method is
        not robust enough to handle very large number of users as
        Web pages get more and more interactive. Java promises to
        move this processing to the client (user's) machine,
        which will free up resources on the server.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
    <li><i>Security:</i> Java was designed to verify and execute
        binary programs in a controlled environment. This
        protects the end-user's computer from viruses and
        security violations. Whenever a Java applet is
        transferred to the user's browser, it is subject to
        byte-code verification. This means that if the packet's
        size is changed along the way, the program will be
        aborted. This checking guards against Trojan horses and
        viruses being added to the Java bytecodes.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
    <li><i>Easier to program than C++, and just as powerful!</i>
        Here are some of the advantages of Java over C++: </li>
    <li><ul>
            <li>No pointers: The Java language passes all arrays
                and objects by reference but does not have an
                explicit pointer type. This prevents the
                programmer from constructing a reference to
                anonymous memory. </li>
            <li>Automatic garbage collection - The Java
                interpreter manages the memory, it is not the
                programmer's responsibility. </li>
            <li>C++ style Exceptions are automatically generated
                when dereferencing a NULL pointer, accessing
                outside the bounds of an array, or running out of
                memory. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><i>Network protocol handlers:</i> Support for HTTP, FTP,
        NNTP, MIME, and Sockets make it sort of a &quot;network
        programming language.&quot;</li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
    <li><i>JavaScript:</i> Netscape wanted a scripting language
        that could give more power to HTML documents. So they
        teamed up with Sun to create <a
        href="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_2.0/script/index.html"
        target="_top">JavaScript</a>. It will run on any browser
        with a Java interpreter.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"
bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
    <tr>
        <td bgcolor="#E0E0E0"><font size="5"><b><i>Java Pros</i></b></font></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<ul>
    <li>Java allows HTML writers the ability to take their pages
        from static information to interactive applications.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Java has broad industry support. It has been licensed by:
        Netscape, Spyglass, Wollongong, Microsoft, Oracle,
        Novell, Borland, Symantec, et. al.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Java runs on many platforms. Sun will distribute versions
        of the compiler and interpreter for the Mac, Solaris,
        Windows 95 and NT. IBM is working on versions for OS/2
        and Windows 3.1. Ports of the interpreter are underway
        for the Amiga, HP, Linux, NeXTStep, MIPS, and Silicon
        Graphics systems by third party developers. </li>
</ul>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"
bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
    <tr>
        <td bgcolor="#E0E0E0"><font size="5"><b><i>Java Cons</i></b></font></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<ul>
    <li>Currently, Java lacks 'persistent' objects. Let's say you
        go to a Web site with a great Java applet and wait for
        several minutes for your browser to download it. The next
        time you visit the site, you need to wait all over again
        (unless the applet is still in your browser's cache).
        Persistence would allow you to store the applet on your
        PC the first time you download it, and only download it
        again if the applet has changed. This doesn't make much
        difference with some of the small applets out there now,
        but it will when Web sites start using Java applets to do
        more complex tasks.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Even though Java was designed to take some of the
        complexities out of coding in a language like C++, it did
        evolve from C++ and is similar in some ways. Programmers
        that don't want to learn C++ may not expend the time and
        energy to learn to code in Java.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>There are no usage metering capabilites. For example:
        once everyone has Java Applets on their Web pages, and
        anyone can run them, how do you charge people for your
        software? Many believe hooks for this kind of processing
        needs to be built into the Java language.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Other areas of Java that need to be improved: </li>
    <li><ul>
            <li>Lacks multimedia objects. </li>
            <li>Lacks a Visual Development Environment like
                Visual Basic or Delphi - although many vendors
                are working on this right now, including Borland,
                Symantec, Powersoft, IBM, Sunsoft, and many
                others. </li>
            <li>No Font support or support for resources like
                icons, menus, etc. </li>
            <li>No imaging support. </li>
            <li>Only supports Sun's audio format. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>In the meantime, take a look at Mike Loukides' article <a
href="http://www.ora.de/gnn/info/java/louk.html">&quot;Java: Not
Just Another Pretty Face&quot;</a> In my opinion, this short
article is a very realistic discussion of the capabilites and
potential of Java. It's well worth reading. </p>
