 <P> <H1>Quantum Cosmology</H1> 
The physical laws that govern the universe prescribe how an initial
state evolves with time. In classical physics, if the initial state of
a system is specified exactly then the subsequent motion will be
completely predictable. In quantum physics, specifying the initial
state of a system allows one to calculate the probability that it will
be found in any other state at a later time. Cosmology attempts to
describe the behaviour of the entire universe using these physical
laws. In applying these laws to the universe one immediately encounters a
problem. What is the initial state that the laws should be applied to? 
In practice, cosmologists tend to work backwards by using the observed
properties of the universe now to understand what it was like at
earlier times. This approach has proved very successful. However it
has led cosmologists back to the question of the initial conditions.
 <P> <A HREF="inf_home.html">Inflation</A> (a period of accelerating
expansion in the very early universe) is now accepted as the standard
explanation of several cosmological problems. In order for inflation
to have occurred, the universe must have been formed containing some
matter in a highly excited state. Inflationary theory does not address
the question of why this matter was in such an excited
state. Answering this demands a theory of the pre-inflationary initial
conditions. There are two serious candidates for such a theory. The
first, proposed by Andrei Linde of Stanford University, is called
chaotic inflation.  According to chaotic inflation, the universe
starts off in a completely random state. In some regions matter will
be more energetic than in others and inflation could ensue, producing
the observable universe.
 <P>

The second contender for a theory of initial conditions is quantum
cosmology, the application of quantum theory to the entire universe. 
At first this sounds absurd because typically large systems 
(such as the universe) obey classical, not quantum, laws. Einstein's theory
of general relativity is a classical theory that accurately 
describes the evolution of the universe
from the first fraction of a second of its existence to now. However it
is known that general relativity is inconsistent with the principles of
quantum theory and is therefore not an appropriate description of physical
processes that occur at very small length scales or over very short times.
To describe such processes one requires a theory of quantum gravity. 
 <P>

In non-gravitational physics the approach to quantum theory that has
proved most successful involves mathematical objects known as path integrals.
Path integrals were introduced by the Nobel prizewinner Richard Feynman, of
CalTech. In the path integral approach, the probability that a system
in an initial state A will evolve to a final state B is given by adding up
a contribution from every possible history of the system that starts in A
and ends in B. For this reason a path integral is often referred to as a
`sum over histories'. For large systems, contributions from similar
histories cancel each other in the sum and only one history is important.
This history is the history that classical physics would predict.
 <P>

For mathematical reasons, path integrals are formulated in a background
with four spatial dimensions rather than three spatial dimensions and one
time dimension. There is a procedure known as `analytic continuation'
which can be used to convert results expressed in terms of four spatial
dimensions into results expressed in terms of three spatial dimensions
and one time dimension. This effectively converts one of the spatial
dimensions into the time dimension. This spatial dimension is sometimes
referred to as `imaginary' time because it involves the use of so-called
imaginary numbers, which are well defined mathematical objects used every
day by electrical engineers.
 <P>

The success of path integrals in describing non-gravitational physics
naturally led to attempts to describe gravity using path integrals. Gravity
is rather different from the other physical forces, whose classical
description involves fields (e.g. electric or magnetic fields) propagating
in spacetime. The classical description of gravity is given by general
relativity, which says that the gravitational force is related to the
curvature of spacetime itself
i.e. to its geometry. Unlike for non-gravitational physics, spacetime
is not just the arena in which physical processes take place but it is
a dynamical field. Therefore a sum over histories
of the gravitational field in quantum gravity
is really a sum over possible geometries for
spacetime.
 <P>

The gravitational field at a fixed time can be described by the geometry
of the three spatial dimensions at that time. The history of the
gravitational field is described by the four dimensional spacetime that
these three spatial dimensions sweep out in time. Therefore the path
integral is a sum over all four dimensional spacetime geometries that
interpolate between the initial and final three dimensional geometries.
In other words it is a sum over all four dimensional spacetimes with two
three dimensional boundaries which match the initial and final conditions.
Once again, mathematical subtleties require that the path integral be
formulated in four spatial dimensions rather than three spatial dimensions
and one time dimension. 
 <P>

The path integral formulation of quantum gravity has many mathematical 
problems. It is also not clear how it relates to more modern attempts at
constructing a theory of quantum gravity such as <A HREF="qg_ss.html">string/M-theory</A>.
However it can be used to correctly calculate quantities that can be
calculated independently in other ways e.g. black hole temperatures
and entropies.
 <P>

We can now return to cosmology. At any moment, the universe is described by
the geometry of the three spatial dimensions as well as by any matter fields
that may be present. Given this data one can, in principle, use the path
integral to calculate the probability of evolving to any other prescribed
state at a later time. However this still requires a knowledge of the initial
state, it does not explain it.
 <P>

Quantum cosmology is a possible solution to this problem. In 1983, Stephen
Hawking and James Hartle developed a theory of quantum cosmology which has
become known as the `No Boundary Proposal'. Recall that the path integral
involves a sum over four dimensional geometries that have boundaries
matching onto the initial and final three geometries. The Hartle-Hawking
proposal is
to simply do away with the initial three geometry i.e. to only include
four dimensional geometries that match onto the final three geometry. The
path integral is interpreted as giving the probability of a universe with
certain properties (i.e. those of the boundary three geometry) being created
from nothing.
 <P>

In practice, calculating probabilities in quantum cosmology using the full
path integral is formidably difficult and an approximation has to be used.
This is known as the semiclassical approximation because its validity lies
somewhere between that of classical and quantum physics. In the semiclassical
approximation one argues that most of the four dimensional geometries occuring
in the path integral will give very small contributions to the path integral
and hence these can be neglected. The path integral can be calculated by just
considering a few geometries that give a particularly large contribution. These
are known as instantons. Instantons don't exist for all choices of boundary
three geometry; however those three geometries that do admit the existence of
instantons are more probable than those that don't. Therefore attention is
usually restricted to three geometries close to these. 
 <P>

Remember that the path integral is a sum over geometries with four spatial
dimensions. Therefore an instanton has four spatial dimensions and a boundary
that matches the three geometry whose probability we wish to compute. 
Typical instantons resemble (four dimensional) surfaces of spheres with
the three geometry slicing the sphere in half.
They can be used to calculate the quantum process of universe 
creation, which cannot be described using classical general relativity.
They only usually exist for
small three geometries, corresponding to the creation of a small universe.
Note that the concept of time does not arise in this process. Universe
creation is not something that takes place inside some bigger spacetime
arena - the instanton describes the spontaneous appearance of a universe from
literally nothing. Once the universe exists, quantum cosmology can be
approximated by general relativity so time appears. 
 <P>

People have found different types of instantons that can provide the
initial conditions for realistic universes. The first attempt to find
an instanton that describes the creation of a universe within the
context of the `no boundary' proposal was made by Stephen Hawking and
Ian Moss. The Hawking-Moss instanton describes the creation of an
eternally inflating universe with `closed' spatial three-geometries.
<P>


It is presently an unsolved question whether our universe contains closed, 
flat or open spatial three-geometries.
In a flat universe, the large-scale spatial geometry looks like
the ordinary three-dimensional space we experience around us.
In contrast to this, the spatial sections of
a realistic closed universe would look like
three-dimensional (surfaces of) spheres with a very large but finite radius. 
An open geometry would look like an infinite hyperboloid.
Only a closed universe would therefore be finite.
There is, however, nowadays strong evidence from cosmological observations
in favour of an infinite open universe.
It is therefore an important question whether there exist instantons that
describe the creation of open universes.
 <P>

The idea behind the Coleman-De Luccia instanton, discovered in 1987,
is that the matter in the early universe is initially in a state known
as a false vacuum. A false vacuum is a classically stable excited
state which is quantum mechanically unstable.  In the quantum theory,
matter which is in a false vacuum may `tunnel' to its true vacuum
state.  The quantum tunnelling of the matter in the early universe was
described by Coleman and De Luccia. They showed that false vacuum
decay proceeds via the nucleation of bubbles in the false
vacuum. Inside each bubble the matter has tunnelled. Surprisingly, the
interior of such a bubble is an infinite open universe in which
inflation may occur. The cosmological instanton describing the
creation of an open universe via this bubble nucleation is known as a
Coleman-De Luccia instanton. <P>

<IMG SRC="images/colemandel.gif"> <P> <STRONG>The Coleman-De Luccia Instanton</STRONG>
</center> <P>

Remember that this scenario requires the existence of a false vacuum
for the matter in the early universe. Moreover, the condition for
inflation to occur once the universe has been created
strongly constrains the way the matter decays to its true
vacuum. Therefore the creation of open inflating universes appears to be 
rather contrived in the absence of any explanation of these specific
pre-inflationary initial conditions.
 <P>

Recently, Stephen Hawking and Neil Turok have proposed a bold solution
to this problem. They constructed a class of instantons that give rise
to open universes in a similar way to the instantons of Coleman and De
Luccia.  However, they did not require the existence of a false vacuum
or other very specific properties of the excited matter state.  The
price they pay for this is that their instantons have singularities:
places where the curvature becomes infinite.  Since singularities are
usually regarded as places where the theory breaks down and must be
replaced by a more fundamental theory, this is a quite controversial
feature of their work. <P>

The question of course arises which of these instantons describes 
correctly the creation of our own universe. The way one might
hope to distinguish between different theories of quantum cosmology is by 
considering quantum fluctuations about these instantons.  
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics implies that vacuum 
fluctuations are present in every quantum theory. In the full quantum picture 
therefore, an instanton provides us just with a background geometry in the 
path integral with respect to which quantum fluctuations need to be
considered.   <P>

During inflation, these quantum mechanical vacuum fluctuations are amplified 
and due to the accelerating expansion of the universe they are stretched to 
macroscopic length scales. Later on, when the universe has cooled, 
they seed the growth of large scale structures (e.g. galaxies)
like those we see today. One sees the imprint of these primordial fluctuations 
as small temperature perturbations in the <A HREF="cmbr_home.html">cosmic microwave background 
radiation</A>.

 <P>
Since different types of instantons predict slightly different fluctuation 
spectra, the temperature perturbations in the cosmic microwave background 
radiation will depend on the instanton from which the universe was created.
In the next decade the satellites MAP and PLANCK will be launched to
measure the temperature of the microwave background radiation in different 
directions on the sky to a very high accuracy. The observations will
not only provide us with a very important test of inflation itself but
may also be the first possibility to observationally distinguish between
different theories for quantum cosmology. <P>


The observations made by MAP and PLANCK will therefore turn the `no boundary' 
proposal and instanton cosmology into real testable science!
