<H2><I>Groups and clusters of galaxies</I></H2>
<P>Galaxies are preferentially found in groups or larger agglomerations called
clusters. The Local Group consists of our own galaxy, the larger spiral 
galaxy Andromeda (M31) and
several smaller satellites, including the Large and Small Magellenic Clouds. </P>
<CENTER><P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/gal_fornax.gif" WIDTH="269" HEIGHT="242" SGI_FULLPATH="/local/euterpe/epss/public_html/cosmology/images/gal_fornax.gif"></P>
</CENTER><CENTER><H5 ALIGN="CENTER"><I>Fornax is a small cluster of spiral and elliptical galaxies near our Local
group. </I></H5>
</CENTER><P><B>Regular clusters</B> have a concentrated central core and 
a well-defined spherical structure.
These are subdivided according to their richness, that is, the number of
galaxies within 1.5 Mpc of the centre (known as the Abell radius). Typically, 
they have a size in the
range 1-10Mpc and a mass M ~ 10^15 solar masses (one followed by 15 zeros, that is,
a million billion suns). The Coma cluster shown here is a very
rich cluster with thousands of ellipticals inside the Abell radius. </P>

This is one of the densest known regions on this scale in the universe.</I></H5>
</CENTER><P><B>Irregular clusters</B> have no well-defined centre, a similar range of sizes, but they are generally
poorer with a mass 10^12 - 10^14 solar masses (i.e. a thousand to a hundred 
thousand million suns). An example is the nearby Virgo cluster. </P>

</CENTER><CENTER><H5 ALIGN="CENTER"><I>Virgo, an irregular cluster, is the nearest large cluster of galaxies.</I></H5>
</CENTER><H2><I> Large-scale structures</I></H2>
<P><B>Superclusters:</B> These usually consist of chains of about a dozen clusters which have a
mass of about 10^16 solar masses (ten million billion suns). 
Our own Local Supercluster is centred on
Virgo and is relatively poor having a size of 15Mpc. The largest superclusters,
like that associated with Coma, are up to 100Mpc in extent. The
system of superclusters forms a network permeating throughout space, on
which about 90% of galaxies are located. </P>
<P></P>
<P><B>The Great Attractor:</B> Measurements of peculiar velocities---deviations away from the Hubble flow
- are achieved by comparing redshifts and galactic distance indicators.
These have revealed enormous coherent motions on scales in excess of 60Mpc.
Consistent with these flows, our own galaxy is moving at about 600km/s towards
a distant object dubbed the `Great Attractor'. This lies at a distance of
45Mpc and has a mass approaching 5x10^16 solar masses. </P>
<P></P>
<P><B>Voids, sheets &amp; filaments:</B> Deep redshift surveys reveal a very bubbly structure to the universe with
galaxies primarily confined to sheets and filaments. Voids are the dominant
feature and have a typical diameter of about 25Mpc. They fill about 90\%
of space and the largest observed, Bootes void, has a diameter of about
124Mpc. Other features that have been observed are the `Great Wall', an
apparent sheet of galaxies 100Mpc long at a distance of about 100Mpc. </P>

</CENTER><H2><I>Deep field surveys</I></H2>
<P>A particularly exciting recent development in the study of large-scale structure
has been the advent of very deep galaxy surveys, notably those currently
being made by the Hubble Space Telescope. These images (below) show galaxies
just a couple of billions years after the Big Bang. One of the remarkable
puzzles presented by this work is that galaxies appear to form earlier than
predicted in most theoretical models. </P>
