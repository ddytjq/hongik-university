 Antievolutionists mistake, or pretend to mistake, these disagreements as 
 indications of dubiousness of the entire doctrine of evolution. Their favorite 
 sport is stringing together quotations, carefully and sometimes expertly taken 
 out of context, to show that nothing is really established or agreed upon

  of the favorite tactics of evolution deniers and other
  pseudoscientists is to use numerous quotations
  to make their case.  For many people the use of
  quote after quote makes a very persuasive argument.
  However, the antievolutionist
  use of quotes is invalid and does not in any way provide
  evidence for creationism or against evolution.  The reasons
	for this
  fall into several major categories: the use of quotations often
  is a fallacy of "argument from authority," 
	selective quotation may be occurring,
	the quotations are
	often out-of-date, the quoted authorities are often not
	appropriate authorities, evolution deniers are sometimes not
	honest in representing who the people they quote are,
	and many of the quotations are misquotations.
 </p>
 <h3><a name="s1-1"></a>
  The fallacy of the argument from authority
 </h3> 
 <p>
	When someone -- no matter 
	what kinds of degrees, qualifications, prestige, or honors 
	he has -- is quoted to support a proposition, it does
	not imply that the proposition is true.
	To imply otherwise is a common fallacy
  called the "argument from authority."
  What should matter
  is not who agrees with  one of your points but rather
  what evidence you can provide that supports it.  
 </p><p>
	A scientific argument is not like
	an elementary school book that says "authoritatively"
	that Albany is the capital of New York, nor is it
	a high school or college textbook that functions to
	summarize current theory and practice of a field.
	The works of antievolutionists are not  merely trying to
	summarize existing mainstream scientific
	knowledge, but are rather trying to argue that
	large parts of it are completely wrong.  The
	young-earth creationists in particular are arguing that <i>most</i>
	of mainstream science is wrong.  A few of them
	<a href="http://www.commonsensescience.org">propose</a>
	that is it very close to all being
	<a href="http://www.oophda.com/cemetary.png">wrong</a>,
	including most of physics and chemistry.  
  Can one really accomplish a complete overturning of mainstream
	scientific thinking and establish creationism as scientific
	knowledge with a list of quotes?
	The idea is na&iuml;ve at best.
 </p><p>
	Some evolution deniers
  will undoubtedly state that
  the <i>overwhelming</i> support of evolution by qualified scientists
  does not by itself prove evolution.  They are correct in saying this. Most
  scientists do not just assert that evolution is correct,
  but rather provide overwhelming
  <a href="/faqs/comdesc/">
	evidence from many fields</a>. If antievolutionists want to say that they 
	are
  opposed to the "argument from authority," they cannot reject
  its use for evolution while simultaneously using it to make 
  their own points.  
  For example,
  if a paleontologist argues that something is a transitional fossil
  and points to various features of the fossil as evidence, then
  merely quoting some other authority saying it is not transitional
	is not an
  adequate response.  The evolution denier <i>must</i> point to specific
  evidence to argue that it is not transitional.  
 </p><p>
	Sometimes there is need of some sort of authority.  Most people
	couldn't make heads or tails out of a fossil since they lack
	the knowledge and practical hands-on experience that a
	professional paleontologist has, just as a paleontologist
	probably could not make sense of the accounting books of a 
	large multi-national corporation.  There is nothing
	wrong with going to appropriate experts when the
	need arises.  However, when one uses an authority, it is
	of vital importance that one not merely quote that authority's
	opinion.  It is not merely the authority's opinion that should
	be used, but rather the authority's evidence, interpretations
	of evidence, and lines of reasoning that should be used.  Furthermore,
	one cannot ignore the evidence and lines of reasoning of authorities
	with different views.
	In science it is the
  evidence, and not who says it, that <i>should</i> count.  If
	quotes are to be used at all, they should used in an argument
	and not as an argument.
 </p><p>
  Real scientific argumentation only rarely involves the use
	of quotes as anyone who has ever looked at scientific papers or
	publications knows.  When an argument is based on evidence
	there is little need for frequent quotations.  Citations and references in
	technical papers tend to be for things like where data came from, 
	where an idea was proposed, where methodology was described, where a line
	of argumentation was made, where a fossil was formally described,
	and other things along those lines.  If the reader doubts that
	papers only rarely use quotes or wants to see for themselves how
	how scientists use the work of other scientists there is a simple
	solution.

  In advertisements for movies, it is usually

	One cannot just pick the expert whose opinion is

  This is especially the case when the quoted authority
  is in the minority among his fellow experts.  There might be
  a very good reason why the authority's views are in the
  minority.  If a writer argues by hand-picking only the

	Was <i>Archaeopteryx</i> a feathered dinosaur? Dr. Alan Feduccia,

	and an evolutionist himself, said: "Paleontologists have tried to turn

	<!-- Text of the article in case it is changed or deleted
	     Accessed online Thursday, January 31, 2002:
	
	Is Archaeopteryx a 'missing link'?
Quick-read this article:
On present evidence, the fossilized creature known as Archaeopteryx should be 
treated as an unusual bird, not as a transitional stage between reptiles and 
birds.

Archaeopteryx is the name given to a creature known only from fossils 
(see Archaeopteryx picture at right). The first Archaeopteryx fossil was 
discovered in 1861 in the Solenhofen Limestone Formation in Bavaria. Because 
it seemed to show a blend of both bird and reptile characters, some people 
have hailed Archaeopteryx as an evolutionary "missing link" between reptiles 
and birds.

But is Archaeopteryx really a "missing link" - some sort of intermediate stage 
between reptiles and birds?

Features of birds and dinosaurs There is no doubt that Archaeopteryx is unique.
It has been classified as a bird because of its feathers, opposable big toe 
(hallux), wishbone (furcula), and pubis. But except for the hallux and solid 
feathers, all the other features are not unique to birds. Archaeopteryx also 
had many dinosaur characters that are not found in modern birds. 

Feathered dinosaurs?
There has been discussion in recent years about the so-called "feathered" 
dinosaurs found as fossils in China. These dinosaurs appear to have had down - 
the soft, furry stuff that birds get before their feathers fully develop. But 
this does not provide evidence that dinosaurs evolved into birds. There is a 
lot more to being a bird than just having feathers (see our article Birds and 
flight were created).

Was Archaeopteryx a feathered dinosaur? Dr. Alan Feduccia, a world authority 
on birds at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and an evolutionist 
himself, said: "Paleontologists have tried to turn Archaeopteryx into an 
earth-bound, feathered dinosaur. But it's not. It is a bird, a perching bird. 
And no amount of 'paleobabble' is going to change that."1

Sharing characters does not prove evolution. Despite having features in common 
with some dinosaurs, the evidence of the feathers and opposable hallux indicates
that Archaeopteryx was an unusual bird (in the same way that the platypus is an
unusual mammal). 

The fact that it had some features in common with reptiles means simply that it
had some features in common with reptiles - not that it evolved. The evidence is
certainly not strong enough to conclude that Archaeopteryx was a "missing link,"
or part of a series of creatures that evolved from dinosaurs into birds.

  Notice the
	author is citing Feduccia's conclusion, and not his evidence.  There
	is no mention that that his opinion is a minority opinion.  Feduccia's
	peers in the field of bird evolution are "authorities" too.
	In short this creationist is saying that Feduccia is an authority and
	that he says that birds are not descended from dinosaurs, therefore
	birds are not descended from dinosaurs.  It is a classic "argument from
	authority."  It is also very inconsistent. 
	Feduccia also says that evolution occurs, so if this argument is to
	be followed to its logical conclusion, this creationist must
	accept the evolution of birds from non-birds!  One could also
	cite many more authorities that say birds are descended from
	theropod dinosaurs.  This is why one should not pick and choose
	authorities.  If Feduccia does turn out to be correct and his views become
	established within the scientific community, then the evolution deniers
	will probably become fond of quoting what
	<a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/people/padian/webintro.html">
	 Kevin Padian</a> and other proponents of birds being descended from
	 dinosaurs had to say about Feduccia's views.

	Feduccia<sup><a href="#r2">2</a></sup> had to say in a chapter
	he called 
	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/books/0300078617/reader/3/nationalcenter02">
	 "Feathered Reptiles"</a>:
 <blockquote>
  ...The creature thus memorialized was <i>Archaeopteryx 
	lithographica</i>, and, though indisputably birdlike, it
	could with equal truth be called reptilian....
	The <i>Archaeopteryx</i> fossil is, in fact, the most superb
	example of a specimen perfectly intermediate between two
	higher groups of living organisms--what has come to be called
	a "missing link," a Rosetta stone of evolution....
 </blockquote><p>
  In all fairness to the antievolutionist, this was probably not a
  deliberate attempt at deception.  Selective quotations
	can be the result of poor scholarship.  His citation
	reveals that he got the quote from a news item in the journal
	<i>Science</i> and not from Feduccia's own writings. This is not
	saying that one cannot quote news articles, but only that it is
	not a substitute for finding out what the expert actually
	thinks from his own writings.  If you want to use someone's
	opinion, it is your responsibility to find out what his opinion
	really is.
 </p><p>
  Thus from one quote we see a whole range of problems that
	resulted from an attempt to "prove" a point with a quotation.
	The moral is that quoting someone is not a substitute
	for researching details and providing details to the
	reader.  Without those details, it is simply saying
	that it is so because so-and-so said so.  Without those
	details it becomes an "argument from authority."

  Evolution deniers often use out-of-date quotes
 </h3>
 <p>
  One must ask whether a quote reflects current
  knowledge or whether it is out-of-date.  
	Antievolutionists often use
  quotations that are decades old.  A lot of progress
  has happened in the last several decades.  What the quoted
  person thought was an unsolved problem may have been solved.
  What the quoted person said has little evidence might now
  have lots of evidence.

 <p>
  The person being quoted might not be
  competent or even knowledgeable about the subject he is
  being quoted on.  Antievolutionists often quote non-biologists,
  who have little knowledge about the field of evolution, as if they
  were "authorities" in the field.  
  If the reader would be unimpressed by a biologist's opinion 
  of astronomical issues, then he should be equally unimpressed 
  by an astronomer's opinion of biological issues.
  Chemists, physicists, mathematicians, 
  or astronomers are almost always laymen when
  they discuss biology.

	Of course there is nothing

 </li><li><a name="Woodmorappe"></a>
	Another
  example is the prominent evolution denier that goes by the
  pseudonym 
	<a href="http://www.rae.org/johnw.htm">"John Woodmorappe"</a>
	whose real
  name is Jan Peczkis. This is easily documented by
  the fact that Woodmorappe's address listed in an article of his in the
  <a href="http://www.creationresearch.org/crsq.html">
	<i>Creation Research Society Quarterly</i></a>
	is identical to
  the listing for Jan Peczkis, that
  Peczkis has the same geology degree as Woodmorappe,
  and that Woodmorappe claims to be a teacher
	while Peczkis is a teacher. The

	 reports</a>
	that Peczkis threatened him with legal action for making this claim online.
	Why bring this up and why would anyone care who Woodmorappe really is?
	Because in an 
	<a href="http://www.rae.org/nihilism.html">online article</a>
	Woodmorappe<sup><a href="#r5">5</a></sup>
	quotes a Peczkis article from the <i>Science Teacher</i> without any
	mention that they are the same person.  Writing something under one name so
	that it can be quoted and given positive notice using a different name is not 
	honest. It is also worth mentioning that Woodmorappe/Peczkis has a well-deserved 
	reputation for
	<a href="http://home.austarnet.com.au/stear/hiding_the_numbers_woody_henke.htm">
	dishonest quoting</a> as well as for 
	<a href="/faqs/woodgeo/wood1.html">

	<a href="http://members.cox.net/ardipithecus/evol/lies/lie027.html">
	incompetent arguments</a>.
 </li></ul><p>
  Of course, like everyone else, a scientist may sometimes say dumb things or 
	be careless with his
  wordings.   Also be careful of  statements by authorities
  that might be exaggerations or self-promotion.  Statements
  in the press that a new discovery changes everything
  that we thought we knew about something are frequently
  exaggerations or self-promotion. 
 </p><p>
  Thus even without the use of
  misquotations, one can "prove" pretty much anything
  by the use of quotations.  Argumentation via quote after quote
  is dubious at best for deciding scientific disputes.  This is
  one reason why scientific papers only rarely use quotes to
  make their case.

 <p>
  Antievolutionists have consistently used misquotations. This document
  will give some of the many examples.    
 </p>
 <h4><a name="s1-6-1"></a>
  Why misquotes happen 
 </h4>
 <p>
  There are many reasons why misquotations occur.
 </p><ul><li>
  Some misquotations
  are honest mistakes. It would be hard not to make some
  misquotations when one's argumentation consists largely
  of quotations, as is the case for many antievolutionary works.
  What makes this problem worse in antievolutionist literature is
  that many creationist writers do not actually read what they
  are quoting in the original but copy it from another
  writer, usually (but not necessarily) another evolution denier
  who himself might have copied it from yet another antievolutionist.
  This is often revealed by multiple evolution deniers having
  the same error in the quote or citation.  Thus if a single
  evolution denier is dishonest, sloppy, or incompetent in his quotation
  then the error becomes widespread.  Antievolutionists (and for that matter
  anyone else) can help avoid this by checking any quote in the
  original if at all possible.  If a quoter has not read the
  original work he should not cite the original as if he did 
  but rather
  indicate in his citation that the quote was taken from
  a secondary source.  <br /><br />
 </li><li>
  Another source of misquotation by antievolutionists is how they
  use quotations and the scientific literature.  Daisie and
  Michael Radner in their <i>Science and Unreason</i> explain
  this rather well.  One of the things they include as  
  "marks of pseudoscience" is
  "Research by Exegesis." They elucidate:
  <sup><a href="#r6">6</a></sup>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   In literary art or in religion, the field of study is the 
   totality of existing writings.  Any piece by Shakespeare or
   any part of a sacred book is fair game for interpretation.  
   The scientist does not approach the literature of his or her
   field in the same way.  Only the historian of science is
   concerned with the whole body of scientific writings.  For 
   the practicing scientist, written reports merely serve to
   communicate the results of research -- data collected,
   theories proposed, arguments and counterarguments.  Insofar
   as a piece of scientific writing fails to communicate well or
   to argue cogently, it is ineffective.  Such work is largely
   ignored in the scientific discipline.
  </p><p>
   Pseudoscientists often reveal themselves by their handling
   of the scientific literature.  Their idea of doing scientific
   research is simply to read the scientific periodicals and
   monographs.  They focus on the words, not on the
   underlying facts and reasoning.  They take science to be
   <i>all statements by scientists</i>.  Science degenerates into
   a secular substitute for sacred literature.  Any statement
   by any scientist can be cited against any other statement.
   Every statement counts and every statement is open to 
   interpretation.
  </p>
 </blockquote></li><li>
  Finally, an evolution denier may indeed not be quoting honestly.
  Many cases of misquotations by antievolutionists are so
  blatant and obvious when compared to the original that it
  is hard to imagine that the original quoter was not being
  intentionally dishonest.  The quotes by Keith Davies
  from the astronomical literature of supernova remnants
  that are discussed below are examples of quotes that many 
  find hard to accept as anything other than the result of 
  deliberate deception.

  <b>FAMOUS EVOLUTIONIST OF THE MONTH QUOTE:</b><br />
  "Paleontologists cannot operate this way. There is simply no way simply to

	The Rethinking of Darwinian Evolution and the Theory of Punctuated 
	Equilibria", pp. 51, 52, (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1985)
 </blockquote>
  When one looks at what Eldredge<sup><a href="#r8">8</a></sup> wrote,
  there is a <i>huge</i> omission that is not marked by ellipses.
	The first two quoted sentences start one paragraph in the original,
	while "And this poses something of a problem..." is in the middle of
	the next paragraph.  Here is the first paragraph with what the creationist
	newsletter quoted in <span class="green">green</span>:
 <blockquote>
  <span class="green">
  Paleontologists cannot operate this way. There is simply no way simply to 
	look at a fossil and say how old it is unless you know the age of the rocks 
	it comes from.
	</span>
	Sometimes igneous rocks, rocks we can date chemically, intrude into 
	sedimentary rocks, and in such a fashion some hard-core "absolute" 
	dates--expressed in terms of millions of years--are available for all 
	subdivisions of geologic time....
 </blockquote>
  Radiometric dating usually cannot be used on the layers of sedimentary rocks with
	fossils, but rather is employed on volcanic layers above and/or below
	the fossiliferous rocks.  If the fossil is in between two datable 
	volcanic tuffs, its date will be dated to being in between the dates of the
	tuffs.   In the work that Eldredge was doing there was often no
	volcanic layer since he was doing work on isolated outcrops, roadcuts, etc.
	So how could he tell time?
	Skipping to the next paragraph Eldredge continues:
 <blockquote>
  But none of that helps in a cow pasture in upstate New York. 
	Long before radioactivity was known to physicists, paleontologists had 
	another way to tell time. Fossils occur in the same vertical sequence 
	thoughout the geologic column. The same, or closely similar fossils 
	frequently occur in many far-flung localities; some are even found worldwide. 
	This repetitive pattern of occurrence allows geological minded paleontologists 
	to correlate: rocks are mapped, and frequently certain distinctive horizons, 
	such as volcanic ashfalls, can be traced over great distances. But rocks in 
	isolated quarries can be matched up according to the nature of the fossils 
	they contain.
	<span class="green">
	 And this poses something of a problem: if we date the rocks by 
	 their fossils, how can we then turn around and talk about the patterns of 
	 evolutionary time in the fossil record?
	</span>...
 </blockquote>
	Kent Hovind has used the same quote without ellipses in the transcript
	for his creation seminar.  It was no longer online
	at the time this paragraph was written.
	In a

	there is "no problem of circularity."

  Even if the words
  are quoted accurately, this does not guarantee that it is
  not a misquotation.

 </li><li>
  Putting text in brackets to make clear to the reader what the
	quoted material means or to note changes made to the text
	can be part of proper quoting.  However sometimes the use
	of brackets can result in giving readers a false impression
	of the meaning or content of the quoted material.
	An example of this is documented
	in <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/7306_pr87_11292001__doubting_dar_11_29_2001.asp">
	"Doubting Darwinism through Creative License."</a><br /><br />
 </li><li>
  Another way of misquotation
  is the result of the readers of the quoter and the readers of the
  quoted having different vocabularies, making different
  assumptions, and interpreting things in different ways. 
  In science, words are often used in different ways
  than what they would mean to a general
  audience. And of course a word might mean different things in
  a different field or can mean  different things depending on
  the context. If an evolution denier's readers don't realize
  this then they are vulnerable to being fooled by a misquotation.
 <ul class="l2"><li>
  Many evolution deniers quote 
	<a href="http://www.freethought-web.org/ctrl/news/stephen_gould.html">
	Stephen Jay Gould</a> and other 
  <a href="/faqs/punc-eq.html">
   punctuated equilibria
  </a> 
  proponents as saying that transitional forms are
  very rare.  Most non-specialists get ideas of "missing
  links" between higher taxa of animals when they hear
  about transitional forms.  Gould has been very clear that
  these are common and yet he has been quoted many times that
  transitional forms are rare.  What is going on here?  In
  the context of punctuated equilibria, a transitional form
  is between immediately related species (say two species of
  squirrels, species of similar Devonian trilobites, etc.),
  and is <i>not</i> referring to a transition between human and 
  non-human,
  whales and primitive land mammals, etc.  Indeed the transitions
  Gould and other punctuated equilibria proponents are arguing
  about would be generally be dismissed  as
  "microevolution" by many evolution deniers.  Thus 
  antievolutionists arguing against the existence of transitions between
  larger taxa are very likely guilty of misquotation 
  if they quote Gould's writings on punctuated equilibria.
	For more details on this see 
	Gould's<sup><a href="#r10">10</a></sup>
	classic essay

	"Evolution as Fact and Theory"</a> where he explains
	his position on the fossil record as well as demonstrates
	young-earth creationist misrepresentations of his views.<br /><br />
 </li><li>
  Another case of a
  word that different people use differently is 
  "Darwinism."
  Some authors use that term very broadly and some use it
  in an extremely narrow sense. <br /><br />
 </li><li>
  Most laymen do not understand that the word "theory" means
	a very 
	<a href="/faqs/evolution-fact.html">
	 different thing</a> in science than it does in
	the vernacular. <br /><br />
 </li><li><a name="topdown"></a>
  <a href="http://www.antievolution.org/people/wells_j/">
	 Jonathan Wells</a><sup><a href="#r11">11</a></sup>
	in the "Darwin's Tree of Life" chapter of his 
	<a href="http://www.iconsofevolution.com/">
	 <i>Icons of Evolution</i></a> tells us:
 <blockquote>
  Some biologists have described this [the Cambrian explosion]
	in terms of "bottom-up" versus "top-down" evolution.  Darwinian
	evolution is "bottom-up," referring to its prediction that lower
	levels in the biological hierarchy should emerge before higher
	ones.  But the Cambrian explosion shows the opposite.  In the
	words of Valentine and his colleagues, the Cambrian pattern
	"creates the impression that [animal] evolution has by and
	large proceeded from the 'top down'." [First bracket is mine and
	the second is by Wells.]
 </blockquote>
  Since Wells is saying that evolution predicts the exact opposite
	of what it actually does it might seem puzzling that Wells could find
	a quote to support his claim.  That is until a visit to the library stacks
	reveals a problem with the context.  Notice that Wells is saying that
	"top-down" means that the higher Linnean hierarchies like phyla
	and classes appear before lower Linnean hierarchies like orders and
	families.  This is actually something that <i>must</i> be true if
	evolution is true.  But that is not how the term was used by the
	authors that Wells quoted as is clear if one reads the sentence
	before the quoted material.  Here is what a bit more of what
	Valentine <i>et al.</i><sup><a href="#r12">12</a></sup>
	had to say on the Cambrian explosion with what Wells
	quoted in <span class="green">green</span>:
 <blockquote>
  In general, for those taxonomic levels for which fossil data 
	seems adequate, higher levels reached their peak diversities
	earlier, and successively lower levels progressively later,
	in geologic time (Valentine, 1969).  This pattern
	<span class="green">
	 creates the impression that metazoan evolution has by and
	 large proceeded from the "top down</span>,<span class="green">"
	</span>
	that the body plans of the phyla originated presumably as
	adaptations that permitted the occupation of major adaptive
	zones, and then, according to the potentials and constraints
	provided and imposed by the body plans, they in turn branched
	to produce the major modifications that are ranked as classes,
	and so on to the ordinal [order] level and below....
 </blockquote>
  There is a great deal of difference between "emerge" 
	or "appear first" (a phrase Wells used in his next paragraph)
	and
	"reached their peak diversity."  Quoting someone and not
	informing the reader that the key term was used in the original in
	a completely different manner forms a 
	misquotation.  
	For those interested learning about some of the many
	distortions Dr. Wells is guilty of might look at the
	<a href="/faqs/wells/">
	 Icon of Obfuscation</a> FAQ.
 </li></ul>
  In general, any quote whose impact depends on what the reader
  does not know is probably out-of-context.

 "So it goes. One scientist after another receives the Creationist
 treatment.  Any qualifying comment, any deviation from orthodoxy

 to serve the Creationists' purpose, namely, to convince the
 uninitiated that Creationist theses are sometimes advanced by
 scientists in scientific debates.  But anyone can play the
 same game.  In conclusion, I cannot resist turning the weapon
 against the Creationist  who has used it to its greatest
 effect. Referring to the controversy about transitional forms,

  Classic example from <i>The Genesis Flood</i>
 </h3> 
 <p>
  A classic example of an antievolutionist misquotation
  comes from <i>The Genesis Flood</i>
  by John C. Whitcomb and 
	<a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/352.asp">
	 Henry M. Morris</a>.<sup><a href="#r14">14</a></sup>&nbsp;
  This book is
  arguably the most influential young-earth creationist
  book in the latter half of the twentieth century.  They
  quote C. P. Ross and Richard 
  Rezak.<sup><a href="#r15">15</a></sup>&nbsp;  
  The
  <span class="green">green</span> 
  text below is quoted by Whitcomb and Morris and black text is what
  they did not quote.
  The context of the quote is the young-earthers trying to debunk
  the existence of the 
  <a href="http://baby.indstate.edu/gga/pmag/crefaqs.htm#how">
   Lewis overthrust
  </a>
  by claiming some
  disturbed strata were little disturbed or undisturbed.
  Ross and Rezak wrote:
 </p><blockquote>
  Folds that originated at the time represented by plate 53B but that 
  have been accentuated and locally broken by the later pressures, are 
  visible in ridges, cliffs, and canyon walls both in the mountains south 
  of Glacier National Park and in the part of the Great Plains within some 
  20 miles of the mountain edge at the eastern border of the park. All the 
  sedimentary rocks that were present were squeezed and folded, but the Belt 
  series, being strong and buried under a blanket of other rocks, was deformed 
  the least. 
  <span class="green">
   Most visitors, especially those who stay on the roads, get
   the impression that the Belt of strata are undisturbed
   and lie almost as flat today as they did when deposited in the sea
   which vanished so many 
  </span>
  million
  <span class="green">
   years ago.
  </span>
  Actually they are folded, and in certain zones they are intensely 
  so. From points on and near the trails in the park
  it is possible to observe places where the beds of the Belt series, 
  as revealed in outcrops on ridges, cliffs, and
  canyon walls, are folded and crumpled almost as intricately as the
  soft younger strata in the mountains south of the
  park and in the Great Plains adjoining the park to the east.

 <h2><a name="s3"></a>Concluding thoughts</h2>
 
 <p>
  Brian and Sandra Alters<sup><a href="#r18">18</a></sup>
	give some good advice for classroom instructors that
	is just plain good advice for everyone else as well:
 </p><blockquote>
  When students read or hear the out-of-context quotes from
	such a book [<i>That Their Words May be Used Against Them</i>
	from the Institute for Creation Research], they quite often
	think that evolution must be a theory in crisis within the
	scientific community.  If creationist students suddenly quote
	respected evolutionary scientists and expect science instructors
	to respond instantly (without even knowing the context of the quotes)
	we recommend the following two actions: (1) instructors should explain
	to the students that they are cognizant of the scientists being
	quoted (if they are) and that the evidence compels these scientists
	to conclude that evolution is an accurate scientific theory, and
	(2) instructors request that the students bring in the <i>original
	sources</i> of the quotes of the quotes so that they can read in
	context.  Having the original source (not the quote book) will
	allow instructors to illustrate to students that there is an entire
	book or article surrounding the one quote and that the publication
	is not challenging the occurrence of evolution.  The goal of this
	exercise is not for students to find evolution compelling simply
	because experts find the data compelling; they should examine
	the evidence and come to their own conclusions.  However, when
	students quote these experts, they need to understand clearly
	the positions of the people they quoting and the contextual
	meaning of the quotes [footnote omitted].
 </blockquote><p>
  If you are a creationist who rejects evolution then before you use
	such quotes, do look them up in the original. 
	If you a supporter of evolution and find
	evolution deniers giving you quotations, demand that they personally
	look up their quotes in the original.  And always be wary any
	quote that seems  "too good" to be true.  If the quote makes
	you ask "how could this person accept evolution?" it is probably
	best to assume their is something wrong with the quotation until
	concrete evidence provided and independent verification is done.
	That is not dogma, but the voice of experience.  Antievolutionists
	have "cried wolf" far too many times.
 </p><p>
  To sum up, when evolution deniers provide quotations many
	questions need to be asked including:
 </p><ul class="out"><li>
  Is the quote itself accurate?
 </li><li>
  Do the preceding and following passages change the meaning of the quote?
 </li><li>
  Does the creationist use the key terms in the same way as the quoted person?
 </li><li>
  What is the quoted person's actual opinion on the point in question?
 </li><li>
  Who was the quoted person addressing?
 </li><li>
  Is the quote out-of-date?
 </li><li>
  Who is the quoted person?
 </li><li>
  Is the quoted person a relevant authority to the issue at hand?
 </li><li>
  What do other relevant authorities think?
 </li><li>
  Is the quote from a popular source or from the primary peer-reviewed
	literature?
 </li><li>
  Is the quoted person actually correct?
 </li></ul>
 <p>
  If a verifiable reference is not provided then consider the quote to be 
	hearsay.   Also remember that it very easy to find statements by
	qualified statements strongly supporting evolution and/or objecting
	to how they have been quoted by evolution deniers.
	This ends the essay portion of this document.  The next
	section gives online sources for the reader to continue exploring
	this issue.
