            disagreement can be difficult to solve but going to court if you 
            have to pay the legal costs can prove extremely expensive, not only 
            if you lost but often even if you win. The Direct Choice Legal 
            Protection Policy underwritten at Lloyd's provides comprehensive 
            cover and in addition offers a 24 hour domestic assistance service.</font></p>
