<P>Our host, Geocities, changed the code for the visitor counter just before Christmas, and since that time it behaved stangely for a while and then finally disappeared altogether recently. A few more fiddles with the code, however, seems to have done the trick, and the counter has now been revived and should keep ticking away as before. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="CENTURY GOTHIC,ARIAL"><CENTER> WELCOME TO 2001 </P>
</CENTER></FONT>

<P>For many people, year 2000 was a roller-coaster of highs and lows. </P>

On a personal note that was certainly the case.  A head on car-crash in early May that could have proved fatal, certainly curtailed production of this web site for longer than expected. Then came the success of the 2000 AMC, the Sydney <A HREF="mknews00.htm"><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="rallans.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT></A> Olympics and Paralympics, followed by the honour of the Australian Sports Awards (more of which later). Finally however, was the sad passing of a great mate to many motorkhana enthusiasts, Victorian Renault driver <B>Rob. Allan</B>, after a courageous 3 year battle with cancer.

<P>The coming year will hopefully only bring good news, and on the <B>Motorkhana WWW </B> front we are looking forward to some exciting improvements. The first and most important, of course, is more frequent updates. Feedback received shows that photos of individual competitors, and event results, are the most sought after features of this web site, so they will receive the most attention.  Changes at work and at home (including a laptop computer from Santa) should mean there will be more opportunity to add updates, and hopefully the support of many local and interstate contributors will continue, and increase. </P>

<P>Other changes planned include a general freshening-up of the website (some of which has occurred already), and some new additions such as a directory of venues, and hopefully some form of on-line motorkhana entry.</P>

<P>Finally, I would like to thank everyone for their support during 2000, and especially for the many good wishes following my accident, which really spurred me on to a speedy recovery.  Special thanks to the state contributors - <B>Dave & Sue Elliott (WA), David Beames (SA), Duncan Sides, Russ. Day, Di Saville & Peter Otzen (Vic), Peter Deck (Tas.), Andrew Collier & Bruce Moxon (NSW) and Scott Doyle & Alan Wheeley (Qld)</B>.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="CENTURY GOTHIC,ARIAL"><CENTER> MOTORKHANA WWWeb QUICK-FIND </P></CENTER></FONT>

<P>Anyone reading this page has obviously discovered the <B>Motorkhana WWWeb</B> site.  However, there are now easier methods to find the site, or to track down the address if it has been forgotten.</P>

<P>The original address 
<A HREF="www.geocities.com/MotorCity/4130/index.htm">
www.geocities.com/MotorCity/4130/index.htm </A> still works, but is not easy to remember, or even to write down.  A much easier address (only recently discovered) is <A HREF="www.geocities.com/vickhana">
www.geocities.com/vickhana </A> which works just as well. To bookmark that address now, just follow the link, then press 'Ctrl D' to add the new address to the end of your bookmark list. </P>

<P>Another quick access to the Motorkhana WWWeb site is to use one of the popular search engines.  On most of these, at least some Motorkhana WWWeb pages should feature in the first page of listings. Most successful currently is the Google search site.  Try it out at <A HREF="www.google.com">www.google.com </A>. Type in the word "motorkhana", and our Home Page should be at the top of the list after pressing the "Search" button , or better still, the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button should open the page directly, without even having to follow any links. Very impressive!</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="CENTURY GOTHIC,ARIAL"><CENTER> NAVIGATING THE MOTORKHANA WWWeb </P></CENTER></FONT>

<P>Some of the "off-season" revisions to the Motorkhana WWWeb site will be aimed at making it easier to use. First of these is to make it easier to get back to the Home Page. This can now be done by clicking on the <IMG SRC="mkwww06.gif" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=16>logo on the top of each page, as it is now an interactive link back to the Home Page. This change will be introduced progressively, firstly to the main pages linking off the Index, to all new pages and eventually to all pages. </P>

<P>Keeping the 'Coming Events' page up-to-date often proves difficult, so whenever there is no current information on that link, it will instead divert to the 'Calendar' page.  The Calendar page is designed to provide information on all events.  If there is any information about an event on the site (pre-event, results, photos, etc) there will be a link created to that information from the <A HREF="mkcal01.htm">Calendar </A> page. </P> 

<P><FONT SIZE=+2 COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="CENTURY GOTHIC,ARIAL"><CENTER> AUSTRALIAN SPORTS AWARDS - 2000 </P></CENTER></FONT>

<P>Quite a few motorkhana identities are amongst over 100 motorsport participants who have been honoured in the recently <IMG SRC="award1.gif" HSPACE=12 ALIGN=LEFT> announced 2000 Australian Sports Awards.  The awards are made to recognise sporting achievments, or to acknowledge long-term service to sport. </P>  

<P>Amongst the motorkhana fraternity, <B>Jim Newell (WA), David Beames (SA), Bill Mc Carthy, Peter Bready, John Rosengrave (Vic.), Wayne Griffiths (NSW), Alan Mc Connell and Alan Wheeley (Qld)</B> are believed to have received the award, which consists of a Certificate signed by the Prime Minister and Govenor-General, full-size and miniature medallions and ribbons, and a letter of recognition.  For most recipients the award was a total surprise, but is an acknowledgment of the role played by motorkhana participants in the development of motor sport. </P>
