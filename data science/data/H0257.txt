<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#800040"><font size=+2>The
Basics</font></font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b><font color="#800040">Cells</font></b>
are the fundamental working units of every living system. All the instructions
needed to direct their activities are contained within the chemical DNA
(deoxyribonucleic acid).</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b><font color="#800040">DNA</font></b>
from all organisms is made up of the same chemical and physical components.
The DNA sequence is the particular side-by-side arrangement of bases along
the DNA strand (e.g., ATTCCGGA). This order spells out the exact instructions
required to create a particular organism with its own unique traits.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The <b><font color="#800040">genome</font></b>
is an organism’s complete set of DNA. Genomes vary widely in size: the
smallest known genome for a free-living organism (a bacterium) contains
about 600,000 DNA base pairs, while human and mouse genomes have some 3
billion. Except for mature red blood cells, all human cells contain a complete
genome.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">DNA in the human genome is arranged into
24 distinct <b><font color="#800040">chromosomes</font></b>--physically
separate molecules that range in length from about 50 million to 250 million
base pairs. A few types of major chromosomal abnormalities, including missing
or extra copies or gross breaks and rejoinings (translocations), can be
detected by microscopic examination. Most changes in DNA, however, are
more subtle and require a closer analysis of the DNA molecule to find perhaps
single-base differences.</font><img SRC="molecularmachine.jpg" height=330 width=418 align=RIGHT>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Each chromosome contains many <b><font color="#800040">genes</font></b>,
the basic physical and functional units of heredity. Genes are specific
sequences of bases that encode instructions on how to make proteins. Genes
comprise only about 2% of the human genome; the remainder consists of noncoding
regions, whose functions may include providing chromosomal structural integrity
and regulating where, when, and in what quantity proteins are made. The
human genome is estimated to contain 30,000 to 40,000 genes.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although genes get a lot of attention,
it’s the <b><font color="#800040">proteins</font></b> that perform most
life functions and even make up the majority of cellular structures. Proteins
are large, complex molecules made up of smaller subunits called amino acids.
Chemical properties that distinguish the 20 different amino acids cause
the protein chains to fold up into specific three-dimensional structures
that define their particular functions in the cell.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The constellation of all proteins in a
cell is called its <b><font color="#800040">proteome</font></b>. Unlike
the relatively unchanging genome, the dynamic proteome changes from minute
to minute in response to tens of thousands of intra- and extracellular
environmental signals. A protein’s chemistry and behavior are specified
by the gene sequence and by the number and identities of other proteins
made in the same cell at the same time and with which it associates and
reacts. Studies to explore protein structure and activities, known as proteomics,
will be the focus of much research for decades to come and will help elucidate
the molecular basis of health and disease.</font>
