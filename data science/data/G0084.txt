<u>Einstein's General Theory of Relativity</u></font></a>
<p>
The General Theory of Relativity is an expansion of the Special Theory
to include gravity as a property of space.  Start with this

<u>The Equivalence Principle</u></font></a>
<p>
The Theory of 
<a href="http://www.sd68.nanaimo.bc.ca/schools/ndss/students/CMACMI6.html">
Special Relativity</a> has as its basic premise that light moves at a uniform 
speed, <i>c = 300,000 km/s</i>, in all frames of reference.  This results in
setting the speed of light as the absolute speed limit in the Universe and
also produced the famous relationship between mass and energy, 
<i>E = mc<sup>2</sup></i>.

The foundation of Einstein's <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/NumRel/GenRelativity.html">General Theory</a> is the
<a href="http://www.phy.syr.edu/courses/modules/LIGHTCONE/equivalence.html">
Equivalence Principle</a> which states the equivalence between 
<i>inertial mass</i> and <i>gravitational mass</i>.
<p>
Inertial Mass is the quantity that determines how difficult it is to alter the 
motion of an  object.  It is the mass in Newton's Second Law:
<font size=+2 color="red"><center>
F = ma
</center></font><p>

Gravitational mass is the mass which determines how strongly two objects 
attract each other by gravity, <i>e.g.</i> the attraction of the earth:
<center>
<img src="./images/physics/F_gravr.gif">
</center><p>

It is the apparent equivalence of these two types of mass which results in the 
uniformity of gravitational acceleration -- Galileo's result that all objects 
fall at the same rate independent of mass:<p>
<center>
<img src="./images/physics/a_gravr.gif">
</center><p>
Galileo and Newton accepted this as a happy coincidence, but Einstein turned 
it into a fundamental principle.  Another way of stating the equivalence 
principle is that gravitational acceleration is indistinguishable from 
other forms of acceleration.  According to this view a student in a closed 
room could not tell the difference between experiencing the gravitational pull 
of the earth at the earth's surface and being in a rocketship in space 
accelerating with a = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.
<center><img src="./images/physics/equiv_1.gif"></center>
<p>
nor could students in a similar room distinguish between free-fall under 
gravity and the weightlessness of space.

<a name="gr"><font size=+1 color="burgundy">
<u>Curved Spacetime</u></font></a>
<Table><TD><b>The second fundamental principle of General Relativity is that 
the presence of <i>matter curves space</i>.  In this view, gravity is not a 
force, as described by Newton, but a curvature in the fabric of space, and 
objects respond to gravity by following the curvature of space in the vicinity 
of a massive object.  The description of the curvature of space is the 
mathematically complicated part of general relativity involving "metrics", 
which describe the way that matter curves space, and tensor calculus.

The figure above represents a two-dimensional slice through three-dimensional
space showing the curvature of space produced by a spherical object, perhaps 
the sun.  Einstein's view is that the planets follow the curvature of space 
around the sun (and produce a tiny amount of curvature themselves).

<u>Predictions of General Relativity</u></font>
Einstein predicted several 
<a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/NumRel/EinsteinTest.html">
experimental effects</a> in which General Relativity differs from Newtonian
Gravity: <img align=right valign=top src="./images/lt_defl.gif">

<ol> 
<li><i><u>Deflection of Light by Gravity</u></i>:  A direct consequence of 
the equivalence principle is that <i>light should be deflected or bent by 
gravity.</i>  Einstein twice calculated the amount that light would be 
deflected passing by the sun, the largest "nearby" mass.  His first 
calculation used only the Equivalence Principle and the equivalent 
mass-energy of a visible photon.  In his second calculation, published in 
1916, he included the space-time metric, which describes the curvature of 
space and time caused by gravity and got an answer twice as large as his first 
calculation.  The second calculation predicts that light from a distant star 
passing by the limb of the sun would be deflected by 1.75 arcseconds (less 
than 1/2000th of a degree).  
<p>
The first opportunity to test Einstein's calculation came with the Solar 
Eclipse of 1919.  British Astrophysicist Sir Arthur Eddington mounted 
a pair of expeditions to West Africa and Brazil to observe the shift in 
position of the Hyades cluster stars behind the occulted sun.  Eddington's
measurements, though not perfectly precise clearly showed a deflection and
favored the larger value.  The result made Einstein world-famous.  The test 
can now be made with greater precision.  Every year the radio source 3C279
is occulted by the sun.  Because the sun is only a modest radio-emitter, 
Radio Astronomers do not need to wait for an eclipse.  Radio interferometry
of 3C279 as it passes behind the sun has confirmed Einstein's calculation
to better than 1%.
<p>
<a href="./images/EinsteinCross.jpg">
<img align=left src="./images/EinsteinCross_sm.jpg"></a>
An exciting and only very recently verified prediction of the bending of light 
by gravity is the existence of 
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/galaxies/gravlens.html">
gravitational lenses</a>;  an optical lens focuses light be refraction, 
bending of light due to the change of the speed of light as it passes through 
a refractive medium.  Because gravity can bend light, massive objects can act 
as lenses, focusing and amplifying images of distant objects.  Gravitational
lenses have rather different properties than "normal" lenses producing
multiple images such as the 
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap961215.html">Einstein Cross</a>, 
a case of a distant quasar imaged by a galaxy between us and the quasar, 
discovered by J. Huchra &amp; colleagues, shown to the left.  If the alignment 
between us, the lensing galaxy, and the distant object, an
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap980330.html">Einstein Ring</a> is
produced.  Distant <a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap980614.html">
galaxy clusters</a> may also act as gravitational lenses.  Astronomers are 
beginning to make use of the gravitational lensing phenomenon to study very 
distant galaxies and quasars.  More about this in Lecture #17.
<p>
<li><i><u>Gravitational Redshift</u>: Light loses energy escaping from a 
gravitational field.</i>  Because the energy of light is proportional to its 
frequency, a shift toward lower energy represents a shift to lower frequency 
and longer wavelength or a shift toward the red for visible light.  This 
gravitational redshift was first observed for the absorption features from
<a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/NumRel/BlackHoleFormation.html#WhiteDwarf">White Dwarf</a> stars, whose light is shifted by about 1&Aring;.  It 
was experimentally verified on earth using gamma-rays travelling from the 
basement to the top of the Jefferson Tower Physics Laboratories at Harvard.
<p>
<li><i><u>Gravitational Time Dilation</u>: Time slows down in a strong 
gravitational field.</i>  Newton's concept of time was an absolute quantity 
flowing uniformly through the Universe.  Einstein showed that the measurement 
of time is <i>relative</i>, depending on the reference frame of the person 
who is making the measurement.  The Special Theory demonstrated that 
timekeepers in motion with respect for each other will measure different 
times for events in each others reference frames:  a timekeeper "at rest" 
will find that an event occurring in a rapidly moving reference frame will 
take a longer time than a timekeeper moving along with the event.  A famous
example of Special Relativistic Time Dilation is the 
<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/twin_intro.html">
<i>Twin Paradox</i></a>:
<p>
Twins Bill and Jill, born within minutes of each other, take differing career 
paths.  Jill becomes an astronaut and Bill becomes a ground-based astronomer.
On their 21st birthday Jill sets out on a space mission to Aldebaran, 32 light 
years away.  Travelling at 99.5% of the speed of light, Jill measures a time of
3.2 years for her trip to Aldebaran and another 3.2 years for her return.
(Incideltally, while she is travelling near the speed of light she also sees
the distance to Aldebaran contracted to a mere 3.2 light years.)
Bill finds that it takes her 32 years and 2 months for each leg.  Upon Jill's 
return, she is 27 while her sibling is 85!  Bizarre as these effects appear to
us slow moving mortals, relativistic time dilation has been 
<a href="http://www.courses.has.vcu.edu/rgowdy/IntroPhy/mod/r41/xmp.htm#4">
repeatedly confirmed</a> in high energy particle accelerators, where particles 
travel near the speed of light, and by atomic clock on supersonic aircraft.
<p>
A similar process occurs in the presence of strong gravity; a timekeeper in 
a strong gravitational field will measure a slower time than one in the 
absence of gravity.  It is not just clocks, by the way, all physical processes:
clocks ticking (however they measure their ticks), hearts beating, aging, etc.,
must slow down, but the only one who notices is the distant timekeeper.
Everything seems "normal" to the person measuring the duration of events in 
his own frame of reference.  Light waves travelling past the sun are slowed 
down by this time dilation by a small but measurable amount.  In 197X the 
Viking Mars Lander performed the initial confirming experiment of 
<i>gravitational time dilation</i> by relaying radio signals back to earth 
from the Martian surface on the other side of the solar system.  Although 
the effects of the intervening solar wind complicate the experiment, NASA 
scientists demonstrated clearly that the radio signals took longer on their 
round trip by just the amount predicted by the predicted slowing of time.
<p>
<li><a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/NumRel/EinsteinTest.html#MercurySwift"><img align=right valign=top src="./images/mercury_sm.jpg">
<i>Precession of Mercury's Orbit</i></a>:  Kepler's first law states 
that planets travel around the sun in elliptical orbits and Newton verified 
this as a consequence of his law of gravity.  Even in Newtonian physics this 
law is not obeyed precisely, because the gravitational pull of the other 
planets perturbs the orbit in a small but detectable way;  It was by these 
small perturbations that the planets Neptune and Pluto were discovered.  It 
was known well before Einstein that these effects cause the axis of the orbit 
of Nercury to rotate slowly, so that its point of closest approach to the sun, 
the <i>perihelion</i>, moves or <i>precesses</i> from orbit to orbit, as shown 
in the figure to the right from NCSA's Relativity site.  The motion is very 
small - it takes a quarter of a million years for Mercury's perihelion to 
complete a full circle around the sun.  However, the effects of the known 
planets cannot account for all of Mercury's precession.  The only plausible 
explanation in Newton's gravity is another planet, even closer to the sun
than Mercury.  This planet, prematurely named Vulcan, was never found despite
exhaustive searches and the extra precession - about 1/100th of a degree per 
century - remained a mystery.  Einstein applied his General Theory to the 
motion of Mercury and found that the somewhat higher gravitational pull
as the planet approaches the sun in General Relativity causes Mercury to 
move a bit further around the sun each time it passes.  His calculation
found exactly the observed extra precession.  Because the precession of 
Mercury's orbit is a direct result of the full General Theory, not just the
Equivalence Principle, Einstein viewed it as the most critical test of his 
theory.

<li><i><u><a href="http://www.curtin.edu.au/curtin/dept/phys-sci/gravity/advanced/advance3.htm">Gravitational Radiation</u></i></a>:  Just as accelerating
charged particles produces disturbances in the electromagnetic field - 
<i>electromagnetic radiation</i> (light) - accelerating masses produce 
disturbances in the gravitational field - <i>gravitational radiation</i>.  In 
General Relativity gravity is viewed as a curvature of Spacetime so
<a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/NumRel/GravWaves.html">Gravitational 
Waves</a> are ripples in the fabric of space and time itself.  A 
gravitational wave alternately stretches and shrinks space as it passes
through, but on a very small scale (as little as a factor of 10<sup>-21</sup>
even for a very strong source).

collisions of neutron stars &amp; black holes</a>, or possibly material 
falling into the blavk hole which may reside in the Galactic Center.   
Gravitational waves have not yet been detected directly, but we believe that 
they have been detected indirectly by radio astronomers in the 
<a href="http://astrosun.tn.cornell.edu/courses/astro201/psr1913.htm">binary
pulsar system 1913+16</a>.  As the pulsar is accelerated around its companion, 
orbiting every 8 hours in this compact system, General Relativity predicts 
that gravitational waves should be produced.  Although these waves are far too 
faint to be detected directly, the binary pulsar system is losing energy 
through this radiation, and the pulsar/neutron star and its companion 
are predicted to be slowly spiralling together.  The rapid radio pulses 
permit precise timing of the pulsar orbit by doppler shifts of the pulse 
period as the pulsar moves toward or away from us.  Since the discovery of 
the binary pulsar in 1974, timing of the pulsar has shown that the stars are 
indeed spiralling together just as predicted.  In 300 million years the 
stars will coalesce - that should produce gravitational radiation that can be 
easily detected!
<p>
<a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/NumRel/LIGO.html">
Laser interferometer observatories</a> are being constructed that will be 
able to detect gravitational waves from possible sources potentially as far 
away as 100 million light years. A collaboration between Caltech and MIT is 
building <a href="http://www.ligo.caltech.edu">LIGO</a>, the Laser 
Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory, to begin observations in 2000
and there are at least five other projects among European, Australian, 
Japanese, and Space Physicist groups constructing other Gravitational-Wave 
Observatories.  Watch this space for News!

<p>
All of this amounts to pretty spectacular confirmation of General Relativity 
Theory.<p>
<font size=+2 color=red><i>So, Einstein was right and Newton was wrong!</font>
</i><p>
Well, that's not really the way science works and besides, Newton was not 
completely wrong and Einstein is not completely right.  Newton's Theory is 
perfectly fine for most calculations of gravity where the field is not too 
strong.  NASA scientists do not use General Relativity to calculate the 
paths of spacecraft that are sent to explore the solar system (not because it 
would be too complicated or difficult, but because it would be a waste of time
- Newton was right as far as most things in the Solar System are concerned).
Furthermore, General Relativity fails on very small scales when quantum 
mechanical effects become important.  Theoretical Physicists are working 
very hard on theories of "Quantum Gravity", but so far no one has succeeded 
in improving Einstein's Theory; no doubt the next better theory of gravity 
will still be an approximation of the "Truth".  Science works by: 
<ol>
<li>developing theories or hypotheses, 
<li>testing them repeatedly by experiment and observation, 
<li>using them where they are shown to be applicable, and 
<li>revising &amp; improving them when they are shown to disagree with 
experiment.
</ol>
This <i>Scientific Method</i> is a never ending cycle.

<u>Black Holes</u></font>
<p>
The French mathematician LaPlace first speculated about the existence of an 
object so compact that the 
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/guidry/violence/black5.html">
escape speed</a> would be greater than the speed of 
light.  The first relativistic calculation was performed by 
<a href="http://www.phy.syr.edu/courses/modules/LIGHTCONE/schwarzschild.html">
Karl Schwarzschild</a> (1916) shortly after Einstein published his theory.
Curiously, Schwarzschild's result is the same as that of LaPlace; an object
with mass M which has a size
<p>
<Table><TD><b>
<font size=+2 color="red"><center>

</center></font><p>
will have an <a href="http://www.curtin.edu.au/curtin/dept/phys-sci/gravity/advanced/advance1.htm">escape speed</a> equal to the speed of light.  We call 
such an object a 
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/blackhole/blackhole.html">
Black Hole</a>.  (Note that for the sun to be a black hole it would have to be compressed by a quarter of a million times down to a 
radius less than 3km.)  A black hole is an object so compact that nothing 
can escape its gravity, not even light.  Mathematically, a black hole is
an object of zero size and infinite density (but <i>finite mass</i>) - a 
singularity.  Schwarzschild's calculation shows that the <i>gravitational
radius</i>, also called the <i>Schwarzschild radius</i> or <i>event
horizon</i>, provides an effective size for a black hole because nothing
can escape from inside the gravitational radius and there can be no
communication from objects inside R<sub>grav</sub> and the outside world.

<p>
First, perhaps we should dispel a prime misapprehension about black holes: 
<i>Black holes are not gigantic vacuum cleaners sucking everything in the 
Universe into their darkness</i>. And you would have to be pretty foolish to 
get caught in the strong gravity of a black hole; hopefully our interstellar 
astronauts will get better training than the hapless space explorers in so 
many bad sci-fi stories.  This is because black holes have finite 
mass and because everything in the Universe is so far apart.  Black holes are 
produced by massive stars as a natural part of the stellar evolutionary 
process. A black hole from a collapsed 10M<sub>
<img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif"></sub> stellar core will have a mass 
of 10 solar masses.  It will produce gravitational effects on neighboring 
stars just like a normal 10M<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif">
</sub> star would.  You need to get close 
to black hole (<i>i.e.</i> near the gravitational radius) for its strong
gravity to "suck you in" or for General Relativistic effects to be important.
<p>
Similarly, if you were on a planet orbiting a star which became a black hole,
you would not be sucked in by the Black Hole's gravity.  If the star loses
no mass, you would feel no change in the gravity and would continue to stay in 
the same orbit.  (Lots of other bad things would happen, particularly if the 
star goes through a supernova explosion.  In that case, cosmic rays &amp; 
gamma rays would extinguish life on the planet and the mass lost in the 
explosion would <i>decrease</i> the gravitational pull of the remnant
causing your planet to fly off into space.)
<p>
<Table><td>
<img src="./images/bh_tid.gif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td><b>
Should you be unfortunate enough (and foolish enough) to be sucked into a 
black hole your demise would be nearly instantaneous <i> in your reference 
frame</i>.  You would first be pulled apart by intense tidal forces because 
the force on your feet would be much stronger than that on your head.  Then 
you would be crushed into infinite density as you become part of the 
singularity at the center of the black hole.
<P>
Things would appear very different to a distant observer due to the General 
Relativistic effects described above.  Time, as measured far away, would 
appear to get slower and slower as you approach the gravitational radius - 
the distant observer would be denied the thrill of actually seeing you 
disappear into the black hole because time "stops" at the gravitational 
radius.  Any signals that you send would be redshifted by increasing amounts
as you near the black hole.

<p>
<Table><TD><b>
We believe that we have found black holes in our galaxy in the form of
<a href="http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/users/public_html/white/xrb/xrb.html">
X-Ray Binary Stars</a>.  In these star systems material may be transferred 
from a main sequence or red giant companion onto the black hole.  (Remember 
that massive stars live fast &amp; die young.)  When a binary star system is 
formed, the more massive star will complete its life cycle first, becoming a 
black hole (or perhaps a neutron star).  When the lower mass companion begins 
to expand, evolving toward the red giant phase, material may be pulled toward 
the black hole.  Because of the angular momentum from the stars mutual orbits, 
the material cannot fall directly down the black hole, but spirals inward 
forming an <i>accretion disk</i>.  The release of gravitational energy as
material spirals into the black hole heats the accretion disk to millions of 
degrees so that it emits x-rays.

Neutron stars in binary star systems may also be x-ray binaries.  Material 
falling from a companion onto a compact neutron star may release just about as 
much gravitational energy as material falling into a black hole.  Neutron stars
will probably be pulsars in x-rays just like in the radio.  Here is a JAVA

an x-ray binary in Cygnus and one of the brightest x-ray sources in the sky.  
In 1972 Cygnus X-1 was identified with a 9th magnitude O supergiant,

orbital analysis indicates has a mass of about 
20M<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif"></sub>,
far too massive to be a neutron star or white dwarf.  Cygnus X-1 also has

Stellar black holes have masses in the range of a few times the mass of the 
sun, up to a few tens of solar masses, but other processes may produce very 
massive black holes.  There is increasing evidence that there may be a million 
solar mass black hole in the <A Href="./MW.html#gc">center of our Milky Way</A>
galaxy, and black holes with masses up to a billion times the sun's mass in 
the cores of other galaxies.  Many astronomers also believe that black holes 
power <A Href="./Quasars.html">quasars</A> and other active galaxies.

is challenging, but worth the effort.
