              of the significant pre-race hype surrounding the men's 1,500 meter 
              final at this year's USATF National Championships centered on 3:53 
              high school miler Alan Webb's presence in the race and how he would 
              fare against his more experienced competitors -- Gabe Jennings, 
              Bryan Berryhill, Seneca Lassiter and others. The hype was so great 
              that ESPN even interrupted Sportscenter to show the race live on 
              national television. When Andy Downin broke the finish tape in 3:37.63 
              to win his first national title, he left many fans scratching their 
              heads -- even the meet announcer misidentified him as he crossed 
              the finish line. Downin, however, has been a factor on the national 
              scene for several years -- taking 6th place twice ('96, '00) at 
              the Olympic Trials, owning a 3:38.36 personal best, finishing 2nd 
              in the 4k at the 2000 U.S. Cross Country Championships and 5th in 
              2001. Downin currently lives and trains in Madison, Wisconsin with 
              his brother <a href="mattdownin.html">Matt</a>, also an elite runner. 
              We caught up with Andy several hours before he headed off to Europe 
              in search of the World Championship 'A' standard. Despite winning 
              the national title, Downin must run 3:36.20 or faster by July 23 
              to earn his spot on the U.S. team.</i></font>

              Yeah, he took off yesterday, he's just doing two races, two 5ks. 
              He's just going over for experience. Hopefully he can pop a PR.</font>

              you both planned your trips to Europe before USATF Nationals?</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              We were both on the same schedule. We had a race set up on the fourth 
              (of July) in Arnhem, the Netherlands, we were in a good race in 
              Hechtel and then we had two races in Germany. We had set all that 
              stuff up by ourselves beforehand, with the outside shot that we'd 
              need to go over and get a standard or two, so we already had the 
              mindset that we were going over there.</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>What's 
              the first race you're doing in Europe?</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              Now? I'm racing on Sunday [July 1] in Scotland. It's just a mile 
              and it was a free trip over there (laughs). It was a much better 
              schedule than before. So I'm racing in Scotland and it will just 
              be a sit and kick type of race. We won't run any standards or anything 
              like that. They're having no rabbit. The first race over there (in 
              Europe) is a waste anyway. [Editor's Note: It turned out to be a 
              1,500, Downin finished 2nd to Seneca Lassiter, 3:50.78 to 3:51.06.]</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Because 
              you're adjusting?</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              Because you're adjusting, and rarely does anyone go over there and 
              just run one race [get the 'A' standard] and then come home. We 
              kind of knew that so we thought this would be perfect. We'll get 
              over there, and almost treat it like a workout.</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Has 
              the plan changed since Nationals in terms of which races you'll 
              do?</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              Yeah, the plan has changed pretty drastically. I'm going a whole 
              different route than my brother. I'm racing in Scotland, then I'm 
              racing in Lausanne (Switzerland) on the fourth (of July), and then 
              Madrid on the eighth -- it's supposed to be a 3:34 race there -- 
              and then to Hechtel<b> </b>again which is supposed to be another 
              3:34 race and that's on the 14th.</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>If 
              you get the 'A' standard early on in your trip, will you come home?</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              If I get it in Lausanne, what I'll do is maybe try and find a good 
              3k somewhere and do that. I probably won't run any more 15's, unless 
              I can find a mile or I can find a 3k. If I can't find that then 
              I'll probably just come home and train.</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Do 
              you have any more races planned in the U.S. this summer?</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              Nothing in the U.S., no. There wasn't going to be anything good 
              enough to get the standard.</font>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Yeah, 
              I guess you could try 10 times over here or you could go over to 
              Europe and try twice and get it.</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              Exactly. Plus, we already planned our trip to Europe and I kind 
              of just get excited about racing in Europe.</font>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Have 
              you raced on the track in Europe before?</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              Yes, in Sweden after the '96 Trials, I went over with the U.S. Developmental 
              Team and raced three or four times over there. I was kind of young 
              then and mentally I just wasn't there. At least now I'm a little 
              more mentally there.</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>And 
              at least you know what to expect this time.</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              I know what to expect, I'm really used to travelling to Europe -- 
              the time change and the long flight and missing a night's sleep 
              -- all the little things.</font>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>You 
              said after winning the 1,500 at Nationals that heading in, only 
              you, your family and your coach really thought you had a chance 
              to win. Were you pretty confident going in?</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              I was more confident than I ever have been in my life. We knew from 
              watching my workouts and the way I was racing. I don't race very 
              much, that's kind of just the way I like it. I don't like to over 
              race. If I go out and run 3:42 or 3:41, I'm pretty good at judging 
              how fit I am, how much faster I could race. Going into it, everything 
              started to click, two or three weeks before. Starting before the 
              adidas Oregon Track Classic, everything started to click, where 
              race pace just feels really easy in practice. So going into it, 
              yeah, I was feeling pretty confident. I was more nervous for the 
              rounds...</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Your 
              heat was pretty close.</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              The heat was close, I don't lead, I won't lead a race of that caliber. 
              When you go out so slow, anyone can come up and nip you. I mean, 
              I only beat Erik Nedeau by two tenths. I was only two tenths from 
              not even making the final (laughs), which is kind of scary.</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Did 
              it pump you up at all that the final was going to be on Sportscenter?</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              You know, I just blocked the whole [Alan] Webb thing out starting 
              about a month ago. I got back from a meet at home and I went on 
              the internet -- I was more looking to see how the Pyrahs and Lassiters 
              had run. I pulled up the results and I kind of couldn't believe 
              it for a second. You know, 3:53. From that point on, I completely 
              blocked it out. I blocked out all the Webb stuff. I considered him 
              a threat and I didn't want the hype of what surrounded him to clog 
              my head.</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">During 
              the heats on Thursday, I was just watching TV like two hours before 
              our race. I'm just watching Sportscenter and they had a five-minute 
              special on him and I'm like &quot;aaagh!&quot;</font>

              No. I would have, but I've been trying to get to sleep earlier so 
              I can slowly adjust (to European time). Was it good?</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Yeah, 
              he was good. He's very quick for a high school kid.</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              Yeah, he's a good kid. I talked to him after his race, he's got 
              a good head on his shoulders.</font>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>And

              You know, I just picture <i>me</i> and as far as track is concerned, 
              yeah, people know more about me than they did a week ago. But I 
              think of <i>him</i> and he's on Letterman, he's on all these shows 
              and this is just a month ago that he did all of this. This must 
              just be huge. But he's taking it all in stride and I'm sure in the 
              next few weeks or so everything will die down.</font>

              I haven't been spending too much time there recently. I worked there 
              the week before Nationals and stuff. It's a great buffer. I need 
              something to do during the day. My brother can sit around and do 
              nothing (laughs) -- I can't do that. I need something filling my

              Not really. Since I've been here, I've done probably 85-90% of the 
              workouts by myself. I like it like that. My roommate, Nate Uselding,<b> 
              </b> is a 4:01 miler. But unfortunately, with his college schedule, 
              we're always on different pages.</font>

              Yeah it's me, Matt, Nate Uselding who, like I said, is a 4:01 miler, 
              Nick Winkel<b> </b>who's a 29:20 10k guy. We have a nice little 
              house here.</font>

              (Reebok) Enclave at all?</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              I ran with the Enclave for two years. I got hurt in '98, I had surgery 
              on my calf for compartment syndrome. In 1997, I ran the U.S. Cross 
              Country Championships in Portland, and I ran terribly -- I was hurt 
              and I didn't know what was wrong with me. I didn't run a race from 
              then until Raleigh Relays in 1999 and I got hurt right after that.</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Did 
              you ever consider giving it up?</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              Oh yeah. Pretty much for about six months there -- the start of 
              1998, right after Portland, when I didn't know what was wrong with 
              me. I saw all sorts of doctors and nobody could give me an answer 
              about what was wrong with me. Then my coach was thinking that it 
              was just mental. Then I was thinking maybe it <i>is</i> mental, 
              maybe I just lost it.</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Were

              Yeah, I was being coached by Gags and working with Matt Centrowitz 
              who was out there too. I had a conversation with my brother one 
              day and I was like <i>Yeah, I'm thinking about moving to Madison</i>.</font>

              things aren't going well, you're in a rut. I felt like I was in 
              a rut in D.C.. I was going out too much, I was getting too used 
              to being hurt, too used to the way things were. I was considering 
              getting a full-time job...</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Oh

              (Laughs) Yeah, I didn't want to do that. I called up Jerry (Schumacher) 
              who was a friend of mine at the time and said, <i>Hey, how would 
              you feel about me moving to Madison,</i> and he said, <i>I think 
              it would be fabulous</i>. </font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Is 
              that when everything started coming together or did it take a while?</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              It took a while. I was pretty out of it, I mean I was pretty injured. 
              I came out here. We went on a really conservative plan when I was 
              running 10 minutes a day for a while. That was November of 1998 
              and I only ran one race [in the next] year. I had a few good cross 
              country races and then my big return was when I got second last 
              year [in the 4k at Cross Country Nationals]. But still, last year 
              outdoors I was nursing this really big hamstring knot that I couldn't 
              get out, and I suffered because I had an infected blister that almost 
              took me out for the year. My whole foot started turning purple. 
              It's just the craziest little things sometimes that just come up 
              and get me out of nowhere (laughs).</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Were 
              you encouraged by your 6th place at the 2000 Olympic Trials?</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              I was not <i>encouraged</i>, but it gave me a big shot in the arm. 
              I always take any disappointment like that and just feed on it. 
              I remember stuff like that. I still remember how it felt to be hurt 
              and sitting at home watching meets. Seeing people run fast and thinking 
              <i>What am </i>I<i> doing?</i> I still remember the summer of 1999 
              when I was staying with my girlfriend in D.C., just sitting there. 
              My brother was out in Eugene running at Nationals. I was in utter 
              pain watching races and seeing results. I feed off it. </font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I 
              didn't watch the Olympic Trials very much just because I knew that 
              I ran about the worst tactical race that I could ever run. I didn't 
              watch it again until just a few weeks ago when I wanted to see what 
              I did wrong (laughs) so I didn't do it again.</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Well 
              I guess it worked.</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              (Laughs) And then I started studying Jason Pyrah and the way he 
              made the last two Olympic teams. I watched him and said <i>He doesn't 
              waste energy. He's getting to 500 meters to go and we've used the 
              same amount of energy only he's with the leaders and I'm in the 
              butt, not even on TV.</i> That was my plan.</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Has 
              it ever been difficult having a brother who also runs at such a 
              high level? I'm sure there must be great parts but you mentioned 
              the difficulty of sitting at home while he was out competing at 
              Nationals in 1999.</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              No, that wasn't really difficult. It's been really, really fantastic 
              this last year because we've both been running well, which is probably 
              the first time in our lives. Anyone who goes back and watches the 
              progress of our careers sees that if one of us is running well, 
              the other is down in a slump. I don't see any problems with it at 
              all. I've always enjoyed running with Matt, doing the little things 
              with Matt. We understand each other without having to talk. We know 
              when we're stressed out that we'll just run together and won't have 
              to talk. I haven't been able to run with anyone for the last month 
              just because I've been getting ready for this race and this time 
              of the season. I just get a little bit on edge. I'll get very anal 
              about how I'll do my runs. You get very aware of how you feel, if 
              you feel like, <i>Oh, I'm a little tired</i>, you get mad if someone 
              comes out and tries to hammer you. We don't do that to each other. 
              We're not very competitive with each other, which is great.</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>And 
              you do run different events, for the most part.</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              We do run different events, yeah, and very, very rarely do we race. 
              People get very excited when we race. But I don't even look at it 
              like that. It's really rare that we'll race and you won't know who 
              will win. Like in the Fall Cross Country Nationals (in December, 
              2000), I pretty much knew he was going to beat me (laughs). I was 
              a miler, really undertrained and just doing basework at that point. 
              He was coming off running 28:45 and doing some major workouts.</font>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>However, 
              you are a very good cross country runner considering that you're 
              a miler -- have you ever considered moving up to the steeplechase 
              or the 5,000m?</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              I probably will run more steeples and fives next year. I did some 
              steeple work earlier this year and just never really had the opportunity 
              to practice going over barriers. </font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Have

            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>It 
              seems like a lot of people who do well in the 4k cross country race

              Yeah, I'm probably pretty suited to it. But again, I just didn't 
              have a good opportunity to practice it, so we didn't find any place 
              in my schedule that I could fit one in. I like the steeple work 
              and the barrier work, it just gives you so much core strength.</font>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>What 
              do you think you'll be running in 2004?</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              I have no idea. Either the 15, the 5 or the steeple. Definitely 
              not the 10 or the marathon (laughs). My brother says the minute 
              I move up to the 5, he won't run the 5 anymore. I'll probably run 
              a few 5s next year. I'll probably run very few 15s next year. My 
              training is based on 3,000 meter training so most of the work that 
              I do is basically 3,000 meter work. We're always ready if I need 
              to run a 5 or if I need to run a steeple.</font>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Can 
              you tell me a little about your high school running?</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              I didn't run until I got into high school. I ran 4:30 as a freshman, 
              4:19 and won the state meet as a sophomore. I went to Duxbury (Mass.) 
              High School. I ran the two-mile as a junior and won states and New 
              Englands in the two-mile and then my senior year, I fooled around 
              with the 800 and ran a little bit of everything. I won the two-mile 
              at the state meet again, ran like 1:53, 4:18 and 9:19.</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Those 
              were your high school PRs?</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              Yeah. I've always been a person who runs at the level of the competition. 
              I always joke with people when they ask, <i>Why have you never broken 
              four minutes for the mile? </i>Up until this year I'd never been 
              in a race that had gone sub-4:00 (laughs), so I've never had to 
              run sub-4:00. That's kind of how it was in high school too. Massachusetts 
              was a little weak at the time so we didn't have that many good milers.</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Did 
              you run cross country?</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              No, I played soccer. Soccer and cross country were both in the fall. 
              I was a three year starter on our soccer team and we won the state 
              championship when I was a sophomore and should have won it my junior 
              year but didn't. Then my senior year we were second in the state. 
              I was All State in soccer my senior year -- soccer was always my 
              first love, so I wasn't going to give it up. I ran a couple cross 
              country meets. As a senior, I won my class meet [which takes place 
              the week before the state meet in Massachusetts]. I was going to 
              run the state meet [my senior year], I qualified, but the state 
              finals [in soccer] were on the same day so I had to choose.</font> 
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>But 
              then you ran cross country at Georgetown?</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>

            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>So 
              that was a pretty big step up then?</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              It was a pretty big step up from no cross country to 8,000 meters 
              and 10k, yeah (laughs). But I always felt pretty good mentally that 
              I didn't run in high school so I didn't have any preconceived notions 
              -- 5k wasn't ingrained in my head.</font>

              I got there but my freshman year, (Steve) Holman and Rich Kenah 
              were seniors. In my class, we had Mark Sivieri who was a 3:40 guy, 
              Eric O'Brien who ran 3:39, Seth Wetzel who ran 4-flat... Sam Gebremarian

              big salary jump. But again, I'm not sure. These are just people's
