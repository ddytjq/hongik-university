<p>The Anthony Nolan Trust aims to maintain the UK's largest register of bone marrow

back-to-back garden at the RHS Flower Show at Tatton Park this year.  Up to 100,000
visitors are expected to visit the show, helping to raise money and awareness for
the charity.  The Cheshire is also committed to providing help in planting the charity
garden.  Volunteers will be sought to take part in building up the project and helping

disabled and disadvantaged children in the North West.  Many of their referrals come
from other children's charities.  This year the charity is celebrating its 10th anniversary,
at its Adventure Farm near Knutsford, by holding an open day in June.  They will be
inviting 3000 individuals/businesses in a bid to raise awareness for its long term

provide respite and terminal care for those children who, as a result of illness or
accident, have a life limiting condition.  The hospice is based in Stoke on Trent
but serves the South Cheshire area in terms of child care.  In 2002 the charity is
launching the start of its Community Nursing Team.  Two regional events are being
hosted by respective Lord Mayors at Crewe Town Hall and Congleton Town Hall to promote
the launch of this new venture.  This will enable the hospice to offer respite and
community care for terminally ill children and their families who would otherwise
have to travel many miles for hospice care.</p>

<p>In Cheshire and South Wirral the money raised by this charity is used to support
the Marie Curie Nursing Service.  The nurses offer practical nursing care and support
to people seriously ill with cancer in the comfort of their own home.  The service
is funded 50% by Marie Curie and 50% by the NHS.  The Masquerade Ball is a fundraising
event which will help to support the costs of providing nursing services in Cheshire.</p>

<p>The charity's vision is of a future where older people are highly valued and have
lives that are richer and voices that are heard.  Their purpose is to secure and uphold
the rights of older people everywhere, working with them to identify their needs and
champion the issues that help them lead better lives.  Help the Aged's strategy includes
ways to combat poverty, reduce isolation, defeat ageism and promote quality in care.
 The Cheshire Handy Van Scheme aims to secure the homes of vulnerable older people
living in Cheshire on low income, free of charge.  A trained fitter with a fully equipped
van visits people at home to assess their needs and implement safety and security
measures.  The Cheshire's donation will pay for all the materials and services for
over 110 jobs.  The service also brings peace of mind to a further five people connected
to the older person, thus reassuring friends, relatives, neighbours and carers.  The
scheme aims to reduce the fear of crime amongst the older population as well as benefiting
the community as a whole.  Home Office statistics show that older people are twice
as likely to be targeted by bogus callers than any other age group and with common
security devices this risk can be reduced by 72%.</p>

<p>The charity aims to offer visually impaired people the same access as sighted people
to traditional, and digital, library and information services.  It was established
in 1882.  The library is in great demand and feels that its services offer more than
just being able to read a book, it’s about literacy, dependence and to be able to
continue learning.  The library services rely on two old and unreliable computers
which is affecting the level of service.  The Cheshire's funding will pay to replace
these computers which store the address and information details for all library members.</p>
