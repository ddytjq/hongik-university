      <h2><a name="Latest News"></a>Latest News</h2>
      <p align="left"><strong>3/8</strong> -- The Windows port 
        of MUUDPIC using MSVC and MFC has been (nearly) completed. This version 
        works much better than the original DOS or Linux versions. Its only error 
        at the moment is that it allows duplicate filenames when it should not 
        and does not ping the clients from time to time to see if they are still 
        active. The Dos box under Windows version has been discontinued and removed 
        since it doesn't work nor ever will. The Linux version is also discontinued 
        and will not work with the Windows one since I updated the protocol to 
        make it more reliable and flexible.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>10/11</strong> -- The <a
href="#Linux">Linux port</a> of MUUDPIC has 
        been released. It would be totally completed except for some curses stuff. 
        Actually my opinion of ncurses is not too great right now, and if anyone 
        would please help, I would appreciate it. I spent 5 minutes (quite literally) 
        porting my logic to Linux, and I've spent over 10-15 hours+ porting only 
        50 lines of code! Curses seems impossible! For some reason, it doesn't 
        show right on VT100, crashes an xterm, corrupts the screen in ANSI, but 
        corrupts it just slightly less in ANSI.SYS mode. What a wonderful piece 
        of crap.</p>

      <h2><a name="What is MUUDPIC"></a>What is MUUDPIC?</h2>
      <p>MUUDPIC stands for Multi-User UDP Internet Chat. The purpose 
        of the project is to create an experimental networking method which will 
        be used in the multiplayer code for <a
href="../tank/index.htm">Project V2143: The Price of Justice</a>. 
        The server/client pair will act almost in an identical way in the chat 
        as they would in the game, and the server will be useable in the PV2143 
        code with only a few minor adjustments. More info is available in this 
        document, or in this <a href="muudpic.txt">readme</a>.</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="#TOC">Return to Top</a></p>
      <h2><a name="The TextGUI"></a>The TextGUI</h2>
      <p align="center">The windowing library which was used in 
        DOS/Linux MUUDPIC is available as a completely separate and usable package, 
        and includes the classes CWindow text window and the CWindow based CTextBox 
        input window designed for multitasking. This libraries work under any 
        operating system and in any compiler which can make DOS/console targets 
        and has a conio.h similar to DJGPP's. I would assume this works for Borland, 
        and possibly for VC++, but I am only supporting it offically for DJGPP.</p>
      <p align="center">The Windows are easy to use with just the 
        insertion operator. Commands are simple. Set up the window and use commands 
        like: MyWin &lt;&lt; &quot;The number &quot; &lt;&lt; 5.5 &lt;&lt; &quot; 
        was sent to the window\n&quot;; and it appears in the window. More detailed 
        information can be found in the <a href="textgui.txt">textgui 
        readme</a>, which is the library's documentation.</p>
      <p align="center">This library is &quot;bugless&quot; beta 
        meaning everything is working and has been working for awhile but has 
        not been hard-core tested so I'm not calling it <u>totally finished</u> 
        until the final MUUDPIC release.</p>
      <p align="center">You can download TextGUI in the <a
href="#Download TextGUI">download section</a>.</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="#TOC">Return to Top</a></p>
      <h2><a name="How it Works"></a>How it Works</h2>
      <p>The server will basically act as a &quot;broadcast station&quot; 
        for the clients, while of course optimizing the data to that only needs 
        to be sent. It will keep track of all of the clients and their current 
        data, espically their static data (like name) so it will not have to be 
        constantly retransmitted across the network. The server will also keep 
        track of client entry/exit/timeout, as well as having the responsability 
        of keeping them all in sync.</p>
      <p>The clients will first connect to the server through a 
        more reliable <a href="../info.htm#TCP">TCP</a>/<a
href="../info.htm#IP">IP</a> method which 
        is protected from packet loss. Then they will send the server their data, 
        in the chat program's case, their user name, and in turn recieve all other 
        users' data from the server. Then this TCP/IP socket will be closed, and 
        everything will go through a separate <a href="../info.htm#UDP">UDP</a> port.</p>
      <p>In a normal chat environment, all messages would be sent 
        using TCP/IP, a reliable protocol used typically in HTTP rather than UDP, 
        a protocol used typically in FTP. However MUUDPIC uses UDP during the 
        chat since the purpose of the program is to simulate the network needed 
        for the PV2143 game, where UDP is needed.</p>
      <p>Unlike TCP/IP packets, UDP packets may arrive late, out 
        of order, or never arrive at all, which may sound unbeneficial, but UDP 
        packets require much less overhead and more can be transmitted in a given 
        time. The more packets (and less data) that can be sent, the greater number 
        of network updates, and the lower the ping rates, resulting in smoother 
        network play. Out of order or late UDP packets can be recovered by setting 
        a &quot;delay&quot; in the game, which means an action takes place a set 
        time after you perform it -- real-time stratedgy games like Starcraft 
        use this method.</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="#TOC">Return to Top</a></p>
      <h2><a name="Current Bugs"></a>Current Bugs</h2>
      <p>MUUDPIC does not ping clients from time to time to check 
        to see if clients are still active and have not dropped.</p>
      <p>Exactly duplicate names are not handled correctly.</p>
      <p>The ncurses code (linux) for TextGUI works fine for the 
        server but there are glitches in the client.</p>
      <p>The linux version is no where near as robust as the Windows 
        and doesn't check the data for validity.</p>
