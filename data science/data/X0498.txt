      Total number in room at start is approx. 34<BR>
      Members 16th Annual WFDF Congress<BR>
      Attendees listed Separately</B></P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>1. CALL TO ORDER</B> - Opening Remarks - (President-
      Bill Wright)</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>Compliments to the Event and Mark Kendall. A great
      predecessor to The World Games. As hoped, the World Games are
      creating a trickle down effect of interest in another level of
      competition.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>Goals of the Congress:<BR>
      -To share visions of what WFDF should do for its members.<BR>
      -Direction we should take the organization in terms of marketing
      of the sport and implementing ideas from members.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>Announcement from Disc Golf Championships World
      Games qualifying countries Canada, USA, Sweden, Great Britain,
      Japan and New Zealand have qualified players to compete in the
      Disc Golf Championships.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>2. TREASURER'S REPORT</B> (Treasurer- Joey Gray)</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>Formal statement of appreciation to previous treasurer,
      Johan Lindgren of Sweden. One of the main objectives has been
      to set up a clear system to track which countries have paid and
      the history of payments for member countries. Presentation of
      a summary of profit and loss should covering the current years'
      and 1999 expenses and revenues. Biggest new contributor is WorldSport.Com.
      Exclusive to GAISF was the payment of $50,000 US dollars. Overall
      due to the amount contributed by GAISF and other disc sponsorships
      the financial well being of the WFDF is very good. See Treasury
      Report. Outreach program is what will help the growth of disc
      sports. What we don't have at this point is a budget for 2001,
      but we want to gather information from the members to determine
      the direction we should go beyond administrative expense.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>Jeroem Pouels questioned the P&amp;L report. Explained
      by Joey as software learning. Budget for 2000 unclear as to how
      to spend money. Outreach must be weighed against other expenditures
      to help with growth of the sport.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>3. GENERAL ORGANIZAION / BY-LAWS<BR>
      </B>Consideration of formal approval for new member status: (Action
      Memo #2)<BR>
      Ireland-Associate Member<BR>
      Russia- Provisional Member<BR>
      Hong Kong- Regular Member<BR>
      Latvia- Provisional Member<BR>
      Slovak Republic- Regular Member<BR>
      Spain- Associate Member<BR>
      Brazil and South Africa- Retroactive Associate Members (1999)</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>a) It was suggested that a representative of each
      aspiring nation say a word about their desire to be members of
      WFDF. Denmark questions if these new countries have true organizations
      or are loosely organized. In regards to GAISF and doping position,
      are they prepared to administer what they have to in regard to
      World Games and future competitions?</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>**New members Ireland would like to become a new
      member. Good participation<BR>
      **Russia 12 years. Teams in four cities. Participate in many
      events around Russia. 100 players active <BR>
      **Hong Kong no one in attendance<BR>
      **Latvia two clubs and 70 players. Tournaments in many parts
      of the region<BR>
      **Slovakia has many players few that are very serious. Some freestylers<BR>
      **Spain has no representatives. Barcelona is the hub. Canary
      islands.<BR>
      **Brazil has maybe 100 players mostly in Sau Paulo.<BR>
      It was decided that a single vote be taken as preliminary approval
      had been given by board members. A motion was presented by Wright
      and seconded to vote in new members or up-grade current members'
      status position. Vote to allow the above countries to become
      WFDF is unanimous. They pass as new members.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>b) A discussion about our paid Board position (Secretary
      General). The goal is to only have volunteers on the board. Goal
      is to have Dan Roddick, the current secretary move off the Board
      as paid consultant when his position is up 2001. He has indicated
      his willingness to make this change.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>It was determined that a paid Board position is
      acceptable by the current by-laws. Wright felt it necessary to
      inform the members and make them aware that the Board was using
      Roddick as a paid consultant. As well Roddick would maintain
      his position as Secretary General. Wright expressed that it is
      eventually the desire of the board to have paid personnel be
      separate from the board and we would work towards that in the
      future. Comments from the members were supportive and encouraged
      expansion of a paid position to support daily activities and
      specialized tasks.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>&nbsp;</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>1) WFDF Non-Profit Status<BR>
      It was brought to the members attentions that we were having
      our non-profit status reviewed by legal counsel Brian Murphy.
      To date no formal response had been issued.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>************<BR>
      Problem number one is about status of ROC and their members.
      There is a split between the disciplines. There is only one vote
      allowed but two people want to represent. The problem of conflict
      resolution is deferred to Dan Roddick with help for resolution.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>*************</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>4. ELECTIONS<BR>
      </B>- Election procedure amendment- (Action Memo Item #3)<BR>
      - Discussion about voting rights of Elected Board of Directors.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>Item Three is action item #3. Change the bylaws
      to have annual election each year rather than to elect board
      members at Congress. Ask for nominees at Congress but not to
      have an actual vote. Effort is to connect electronically if at
      all possible. Strike last sentence of Article III section 2.
      Action memo three passes amended bylaws allow for elections of
      new members to be elected in November rather than at the Congress.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>ORIGINAL ARTICLE III<BR>
      2. Election and Term of Directors. At each annual meeting of
      the Congress the members shall elect directors to hold office
      for the designated term of office. Each director shall hold office
      until the expiration of the term for which he or she was elected
      and until his or her successor has been elected and shall have
      qualified, or until his or her resignation or removal. Directors
      shall serve for two year terms, to be staggered as determined
      by the Congress.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>AMMEND ARTICLE III, SECTION 2 WILL NOW READ<BR>
      <I>2. An annual election will be held every second Tuesday of
      November to elect directors to hold office for the designated
      term of office. Each director shall hold office until the expiration
      of the term for which he or she was elected and until his or
      her successor has been elected and shall have qualified, or until
      his or her resignation or removal. Directors shall serve for
      two year terms, to be staggered as determined by the Congress.</I></P>

      &shy; (Memo Item #4)<BR>
      - Team Sport Committee (Mead)<BR>
      - Rules Committee (Roddick)<BR>
      - Working Committee<BR>
      - Individual Events Committee</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>Team Sport Committee Charlie Mead- Identify committee
      members. Issues being addressed. <BR>
      Ultimate Committee Objectives. <BR>
      - Standards for tournament play. <BR>
      - Consistent level of service for players at World Championships.
<BR>
      - Provide advice to tournament directors on various aspects of
      WFDF tournaments.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>How did we get here? Big Bang emphasis on Ultimate.
      Big Growth in the past two years. WFDF Board and Ultimate Committee.
      Today's Situation- Mix of good will, word of mouth and individual
      commitment. Some of the problems are: lack of consistency, variations
      in quality, and little formal basis for discussion. Some progress
      with bid proposal and contract have been made. Ongoing work to
      achieve objectives. A TD Manual has been developed to guide Tournament
      Directors in their production of major events. A contract with
      the Tournament Director and the organizing committee has been
      developed. Communication systems have been put in place to help
      the production of events. Of course, we are always looking for
      input from WFDF members and other sources to facilitate ultimate
      committee organization.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>Where next? All documentation is on going and will
      continue to be developed. Development of WFDF sanctioned events-WUICC,
      WSCC etc. Responsibility of WFDF Board and Ultimate Committee.
      . Identification of further action items is on going. An emphasis
      was made that we will return to the guidelines of the by-laws
      and structure our committee as they are described. Separate adhoc
      committees will be established as necessary. It was also indicated
      that committee chairs will also be voted in by members as are
      board positions. All this is not new, but needed to be reestablished.

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>7. SCHEDULING / BIDS REVIEW<BR>
      </B>- WUCC 2002 - Hawaii<BR>
      - GAISF / IWGA Schedule</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>Hawaii has bid for the next World Championships
      in 2002. The vote was unanimous, but under the conditions that
      they re-present the bid with a more detailed budget, costing
      and assurances about the transportation and accommodation issues.
      It is a solid bid as it stands and good enough to proceed.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>Newspaper article is discussed regarding the opening
      of the new Hawaii complex. Great detail was expressed. The cost
      to players will be approximately same as here $160.00 per player.
      Transit will be free. Grant Wise is believed to be a competent
      TD. Dates for next worlds in Hawaii are the 2nd week of August.
      Various questions regarding daylight, grass, fees, UPA responsibility
      and some other logistical questions.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>- Schedule Cycle Review (Rue)</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>Argument is being presented to go back to a two-year
      cycle instead of the four-year, which is currently in effect.
      This is by Rue Veitl. What do we want to do to develop the sport.
      Is it asking too much for a great event every two years? What
      do the Ultimate players want? Play more. Is it possible to have
      a compromise? Every three years. The point was made that some
      smaller countries might not be able to go to Hawaii, so they
      might not be able to get to a World Club Championship for eight
      years. They point was also made that the WFDF is lagging behind
      the growth of the sport. We need to start a bulletin board to
      have discussions for feedback. The representative nature of WFDF
      facilitates that one representative be the ear for many. This
      decision for a four-year cycle was decided by Congress. This
      issue is going to be a topic of ongoing discussion. Many points
      were presented.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>The four-year cycle was intended to make it easier
      for countries to travel by not having to go so far every year.
      The hope was that a regional event series would develop that
      allows countries the opportunity to compete in a major event
      closer to home. Regional event have yet to develop and so it
      is harder to see this as reality. It was also anticipated that
      these regional events would be WFDF sanctioned and therefore
      be a revenue source for the organization since the four year
      cycle actually makes less revenue because there will be less
      World Championships. Another concern that the four year cycle
      would help resolve was the fact that World Championships tournament
      directors were hard to come by and less need would help. The
      regional events would also provide a proving ground of sorts
      for the TD's to develop. The last point in favor of the four-year
      cycle was a &quot;prestige&quot; factor would enhance the World
      title each time it was held. Charlie explained that the decision
      was made after a long period of discussion that covered several
      years.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>The two or three year cycles as Rue has proposed
      goes back to what originally was so that countries have an opportunity
      each year to compete in major World Championships. Several countries
      have expressed that a World Championships actually helps them
      solicit their governments for funding as it helps them appear
      on a world stage. The overwhelming argument for having world
      titles more often is simply that the players want to play more.
      This move to a four-year cycle seems to eliminate event rather
      than create them and the point of WFDF should be to encourage
      and develop more play around the world. There was also concern
      by Rue that the decision was not a majority. His concern here
      is that the decision was made without adequate representation
      and dispersal of information prior to the vote that was taken.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>Of the 23 nations represented at Congress, Japan
      directly indicated they wanted a return to the previous cycle
      primarily because it helped them in funding causes. Gary Jarvis,
      New Zealand, indicated his desire to return to the original cycle
      of play because of the frequency. All other countries either
      wanted the change to stay or did not express an opinion. Several
      European representatives specifically wanted the new cycle so
      that they could develop European Championships. Support from
      Germany and Sweden, Finland, France and Italy was expressed for
      this reason.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>Primarily the smaller countries expressed a concern
      about funding travel each year and the idea of more regionalized
      WFDF sanctioned events sounds appealing. The item to remain open
      for discussion and it was promised to Rue that we would develop
      a discussion area on our web site to get more feedback. Rue had
      the impression that the individual player was not being represented
      by a single country vote in the WFDF system.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT><B>8. WORLD GAMES</B> (Morooka, Wright)<BR>
      - Review of qualifying procedures<BR>
      - Review of Schedule &amp; Site</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>There were several points of interest that Mr.
      Morooka has highlighted. As of the time of the meeting the Disc
      Golf country qualifies had been chosen. Canada, New Zealand,
      Japan, Sweden, United States and Great Britain are the countries
      qualified to participate in The World Games. It is now the responsibility
      of the member associations to pick the athlete representatives
      to play in Akita. A similar situation will arise with the qualifiers
      in ultimate.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>A Schedule is tentatively set and passed out by
      Moro as well as information regarding WFDF Officials and Sponsoring
      Organizations for World Games participants. The World Games comes
      with a variety of requirements that are not normal for flying
      disc events. A format for how officials would be selected was
      also presented by Mr. Morooka at the congress. There are still
      a few positions to be decided and there is a need for additional
      volunteers at the site of the games.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>There was some discussion about the format that
      has been set for some time for ultimate play. The 6 on 6 format
      with 3 men and 3 women met with some dissatisfied representatives.
      It was explained that these decision were not made without much
      consideration and the decision had to be made almost 2 years
      ago. With so many restrictions on the number of players, WFDF
      established the format based on input from national associations
      and the restrictions.</P>

      <P ALIGN=LEFT>A Promotional video was shown about the various
      new sports being featured in Akita in 2001. <BR>
