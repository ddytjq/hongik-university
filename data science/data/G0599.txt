#A2.1">Variable stars</a> have proven to be one of the most reliable types of 
"standard candles".  <i>Cepheid Variables</i> are giant stars which have
instabilities in their envelopes that cause them to pulsate in size, 
temperature and luminosity over timescales of a few days.  Below is the 
<i>light curve</i> (brightness as a function of time) for 
<img src="./images/greek/delta.gif"> Cephei, the variable star in the 
constellation Cepheus 
from which the stars derive their name.  This 
<a href="./images/anim/cepheid_var.mpg">Mpeg animation</a> shows the pulsation
of a cepheid.

(You can determine your own light curve from the
<a href="http://www.aavso.org/curvegenerator.stm">AAVSO</a>)</center>
<p>
The pulsations of Cepheids are very regular; 
<img src="./images/greek/delta.gif"> Cephei 
has a <i>period</i> of pulsation (time between maxima or minima) of 5.366341 
days.  Furthermore the <i>period</i> is directly related to the
luminosity of the star as shown from the <i>Period-Luminosity Relation</i>.
<p>
<center><img src="./images/cepheid.gif"></center>
<p>
This relationship was first discovered by 
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap981027.html">Henrietta Leavitt</a> 
at Harvard who 
noticed that Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds hae a relationship between 
apparent brightness and period in the sense that brighter Cepheids have longer
pulsation periods.  Since all the stars in the Magellanic clouds are about the 
same distance, this relationship must be a relationship between luminosity and
period as well.  Cepheids exemplify the desirable characteristics of 
<i>standard candles</i>:
<ul>
<li> Their luminosities may be determined from the P-L relationship which has 
	very little scatter.
<li> They are giant stars so they are pretty luminous and can be seen out to
	relatively large distances.  With HST Cepheids are being studied in 
	galaxies in the Virgo Cluster. about 50 million light-years away.
<li> The variability of Cepheids makes them easy to pick out.  Photographs
	(now digital images) are obtained of galaxies over several nights.
	When the images are compared, most stars don't change, but the 
	Cepheids blink brighter and fainter and are easily distinguished from
	the billions of other "normal" stars.
</ul>
One of the prime goals of the Hubble Space Telescope has been the detection of 
Cepheid variable stars in distant galaxies.  Before HST Cepheids had only been 
detected in very nearby galaxies, out to about 12 million ly.  A team led br 
Dr. Wendy Freedman of the Carnegie Observatories has detected the furthest 
Cepheids yet in the Virgo Cluster spiral

of about 50 million light-years.

Probably the most promising new distance determination technique involves the 
use of <i>Type Ia Supernovae</i> as "Standard Candles".  Type Ia Supernovae 
are white dwarf stars in binary systems in which mass is being transferred 
from an evolving companion onto the white dwarf.  If the amount of matter 
transferred is enough to push the white dwarf over the 
1.4 M<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif"></sub> "Chandrasekhar limit" 
for electron-degeneracy support, the white dwarf will begin to collapse
under gravity.  Unlike massive stars with iron cores, the white dwarf will 
have a C/O core which can undergo further nuclear reactions.  The collapse of 
the white dwarf liberates enough heat 
that nuclear reactions ignite and blow the remnant apart in a thermonuclear
deflagration.  These SNIa explosions have all the right characteristics for 
Standard Candles; they are:
<ul>
<li><i>extremely bright</i>, outshining the entire galaxy of stars in which 
they reside.
<li><i>easily detected</i>, but very <i>rare</I>, occurring only about once 
every 500 years in our galaxy.
<li><i>very uniform in brightness</i> at maximum light. 
</ul>

<u>Doppler Shift/Hubble Law</u></font></a>
<p>
The <a href="http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~soper/Light/doppler.html">doppler 
shift</a> is a shift in wavelength or frequency of a wave due to relative 
motion of the source and receiver.  If the source of waves is moving 
<i>toward</i> the receiver (or vice versa) each successive wavecrest is 
emitted a small distance closer to the receiver, the wavecrests will be 
closer together and the wave will be"squashed as shown below (shorter 
wavelengths &amp; higher frequency).  Similarly, if the source of waves is 
moving <i>away from</i> the receiver each successive wavecrest is emitted a 
small distance further away, the wavecrests will be further apart
and the wave will be"stretched" (longer wavelengths, lower frequency).  
This is the phenomenon that causes the apparent shift in pitch (from higher 
approaching to lower receding) as a train passes by sounding its whistle.

<p>
Because shorter wavelength is toward the blue and longer wavelengths are 
toward the red for visible light, approaching velocities are said to produce 
"blueshifts" and receding velocities produce redshifts.  for speeds small 
compared to the velocity of light the shift is given by:

From the work of Slipher in the early part of the 1900's astronomers knew that 
most of the spiral nebulae (galaxies) are receding from us. 
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap960217.html">Edwin Hubble</a>
demonstrated that there was a linear relationship between distance and 
velocity for galaxies.

The data from Hubble's original velocity-distance relationship.  Hubble's 
distance scale was in error by a factor of several, but his result was a most 
important one, demonstrating that the Universe is expanding and providing a 
means of estimating the distances to galaxies at the "edge of the Universe.
Hubble's "law" is
<p><center><font size=+2 color="red">
v = H x d
</center></font><p>
with the modern value of the slope, H, called the 
<a href="http://csep1.phy.ornl.gov/guidry/violence/hubble_constant.html">Hubble
Parameter</a> (sometimes called <i>Hubble Constant</i>, but as we shall see it 
is not constant):
<p><center><font size=+2 color="red">
H <img src="./images/doodads/apprx_r.gif"> 20 km/s/million l. y.
</center></font><p>
The precise value of the <i>Hubble Parameter</i> is a matter of very hot 
debate with different groups proposing values between 15  km/s/million l. y.
to 25  km/s/million l. y.
It is interesting to note that the units for the Hubble Parameter are 1/time
and the current estimate corresponds to a time of about 15 billion years.
What might this time correspont to?
