<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#800040"><font size=+2>Achivement
of a Draft Human Genome Sequence</font></font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">In February 2001,
HGP and Celera Genomics scientists published the long-awaited details of
the working-draft DNA sequence. Although the draft is filled with mysteries,
the first panoramic view of the human genetic landscape has revealed a
wealth of information and some early surprises. Papers describing research
observations in the journals <i>Nature</i> (Feb. 15, 2001) and <i>Science</i>
(Feb. 16, 2001) are <a href="http://www.ornl.gov/hgmis/project/journals/journals.html">freely
accessible</a>.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">Although clearly
not a Holy Grail or Rosetta Stone for deciphering all of biology--two early
metaphors commonly used to&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">describe the coveted
prize--the sequence is a magnificent and unprecedented resource that will
serve as a basis for research and discovery throughout this century and
beyond. It will have diverse practical applications and a profound impact
upon how we view ourselves and our place in the tapestry of life.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">One insight already
gleaned from the sequence is that, even on the molecular level, we are
more than the sum of our 35,000 or so genes. Surprisingly, this newly estimated
number of genes is only one-third as great as previously thought and only
twice as many as those of a tiny transparent worm, although the numbers
may be revised as more computational and experimental analyses are performed.
At once humbled and intrigued by this finding, scientists suggest that
the genetic key to human complexity lies not in the number of genes but
in how gene parts are used to build different products in a process called
alternative splicing. Other sources of added complexity are the thousands
of chemical modifications made to proteins and the repertoire of regulatory
mechanisms controlling these processes.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">The draft encompasses
90% of the human genome's euchromatic portion, which contains the most
genes. In constructing the working draft, the 16 genome sequencing centers
produced over 22.1 billion bases of raw sequence data, comprising overlapping
fragments totaling 3.9 billion bases and providing sevenfold coverage (sequenced
seven times) of the human genome. Over 30% is high-quality, finished sequence,
with eight- to tenfold coverage, 99.99% accuracy, and few gaps.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#800040"><font size=+1>High-Quality
Version Expected in 2003</font></font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">The entire working
draft will be finished to high quality by 2003. Coincidentally, that year
also will be the 50th anniversary of Watson and Crick's <a href="http://www.nature.com/genomics/human/watson-crick/">publication
of DNA structure</a> that launched the era of molecular genetics. Much
will remain to be deciphered even then. Some highlights follow from Nature,
Science, and The Wellcome Trust philanthropy (an HGP funder).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#800040"><font size=+1>By
the Numbers</font></font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The human genome contains 3164.7 million chemical
nucleotide bases (A, C, T, and G).</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The average gene consists of 3000 bases, but
sizes vary greatly, with the largest known human gene being dystrophin
at 2.4 million bases.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The total number of genes is estimated at
30,000 to 40,000, much lower than previous estimates of 80,000 to 140,000
that had been based on extrapolations from gene-rich areas as opposed to
a composite of gene-rich and gene-poor areas.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The order of almost all (99.9%) nucleotide
bases is exactly the same in all people.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The functions are unknown for more than 50%
of discovered genes.</font></li>
</ul>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#800040">The Wheat from the
Chaff</font></font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">About 2% of the genome encodes instructions
for the synthesis of proteins.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Repeated sequences that do not code for proteins
(&Ograve;junk DNA&Oacute;) make up at least 50% of the human genome.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Repetitive sequences are thought to have no
direct functions, but they shed light on chromosome structure and dynamics.
Over time, these repeats reshape the genome by rearranging it, thereby
creating entirely new genes or modifying and reshuffling existing genes.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">During the past 50 million years, a dramatic
decrease seems to have occurred in the rate of accumulation of these repeats.</font></li>
</ul>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#800040">How It's Arranged</font></font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The human genome’s gene-dense “urban centers”
are composed predominantly of the DNA building blocks G and C.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">In contrast, the gene-poor “deserts” are rich
in the DNA building blocks A and T. GC- and AT-rich regions usually can
be seen through a microscope as light and dark bands on the chromosomes.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Genes appear to be concentrated in random
areas along the genome, with vast expanses of noncoding DNA between.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Stretches of up to 30,000 C and G bases repeating
over and over often occur adjacent to gene-rich areas, forming a barrier
between the genes and the “junk DNA.” These CpG islands are believed to
help regulate gene activity.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Chromosome 1 has the most genes (2968), and
the Y chromosome has the fewest (231).</font></li>
</ul>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#800040">How the Human Genome
Compares with Those of Other Organisms</font></font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Unlike the human’s seemingly random distribution
of gene-rich areas, many other organisms’ genomes are more uniform, with
genes evenly spaced throughout.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Humans have on average three times as many
kinds of proteins as the fly or worm because of mRNA transcript “alternative
splicing” and chemical modifications to the proteins. This process can
yield different protein products from the same gene.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Humans share most of the same protein families
with worms, flies, and plants, but the number of gene family members has
expanded in humans, especially in proteins involved in development and
immunity.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The human genome has a much greater portion
(50%) of repeat sequences than the mustard weed (11%), the worm (7%), and
the fly (3%).</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although humans appear to have stopped accumulating
repetitive DNA over 50 million years ago, there seems to be no such decline
in rodents. This may account for some of the fundamental differences between
hominids and rodents, although estimates of gene numbers are similar in
both species. Scientists have proposed many theories to explain evolutionary
contrasts between humans and other organisms, including life span, litter
sizes, inbreeding, and genetic drift.</font></li>
</ul>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#800040">Variations and Mutations</font></font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Scientists have identified about 1.4 million
locations where single-base DNA differences (SNPs, see Goals Box: <a href="3.html">Sequence
Variation</a>) occur in humans. This information promises to revolutionize
the processes of finding chromosomal locations for disease-associated sequences
and tracing human history.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The ratio of germline (sperm or egg cell)
mutations is 2:1 in males vs females. Researchers point to several reasons
for the higher mutation rate in the male germline, including the greater
number of cell divisions required for sperm formation than for eggs.</font></li>
</ul>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#800040">Applications, Future
Challenges</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Deriving meaningful knowledge from the
DNA sequence will define research through the coming decades to inform
our understanding of biological systems. This enormous task will require
the expertise and creativity of tens of thousands of scientists from varied
disciplines in both the public and private sectors worldwide.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The draft sequence already is having an
impact on finding genes associated with disease. Genes have been pinpointed
and associated with numerous diseases and disorders including breast cancer,
muscle disease, deafness, and blindness. Additionally, finding the DNA
sequences underlying such common diseases as cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
arthritis, and cancers is being aided by the human SNP maps generated in
the HGP in cooperation with the private sector. These genes and SNPs provide
focused targets for the development of effective new therapies.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One of the greatest impacts of having the
sequence may well be in enabling an entirely new approach to biological
research. In the past, researchers studied one or a few genes at a time.
With whole-genome sequences and new automated, high-throughput technologies,
they can approach questions systematically and on a grand scale. They can
study all the genes in a genome, for example, or all the gene products
in a particular tissue or organ or tumor, or how tens of thousands of genes
and proteins work together in interconnected networks to orchestrate the
chemistry of life.</font>
