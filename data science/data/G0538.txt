<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>There may be two very subtle hints for a non-traditional universe<strong>:</strong> (1) we seem to have a "lite density" model and (2) "homogeneity", both of which may be easier to explain in Riemannian space than Friedmann
space. </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Quite honestly, I'm not sure the discussion here is convincing enough
to indicate that we have Riemannian space.   On the other hand, the <a href="hubhor3.html#theorem">

  <h4>
  <center>A "Lite Density" Universe - Is It a Hint for Riemannian Space?</center>
  </h4>
 </font> 
  <pre>
</pre>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The most popular variation of Friedmann space today is the inflationary
model, so named because for a split second after the expansion started space
expanded <em>faster</em> than the speed of light.   One of its predictions
is a "flat" Friedmann universe with <strong>critical density</strong>, whose
value is determined by: </p>
  <p> <font color="navy"> 
  <center><strong>&rho<sub>c</sub> = 3H<sup>2</sup>/(8 &pi G)</strong></center>
 </font> </p>
  <p> where &rho<sub>c</sub> = critical density,
H = Hubble's constant, and G = Newton's gravitational constant. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <blockquote> <font color="red">
[You get &pi to show up properly only if you separate it from the other terms.   This is why there's that awkward separation of the terms, which I tried to offset by enclosing them in parentheses.   For your convenience here is the same formula, using coding that should show up properly on the Internet Explorer browser:
<p>
<font color=navy>
<center>
<strong><font face=symbol>r</font><sub>c</sub> = 3H<sup>2</sup>/8<font face=symbol>p</font>G
</strong>
</center>
</font>
<p>
<a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/CosmoCalc.html">
Ned Wright's Javascript</a> referred to &Omega<sub>
m</sub> in Appendix 8.   If we suppose that the density of the universe we
actually <em>observe</em> is &rho<sub>m</sub>, then
    &Omega<sub>m</sub> =  &rho<sub>
m</sub>/&rho<sub>c</sub>.
<p>
The "theorists" usually split &rho<sub>m</sub> into two parts: 
<ol>
<li>&rho<sub>b</sub>, the baryonic density, which is the type of matter decribed in chemistry and nuclear physics (protons, electrons, neutrons, and the veritable zoo of other subatomic  particles).   The best guess is that the baryonic density is only about 3% to 5% of critical density.
<p>
<li>&rho<sub>cdm</sub>, this is the inferred "<strong>c</strong>old <strong>d</strong>ark <strong>m</strong>atter", supposedly matter that does not interact with baryonic matter (except via gravity).   It appears to be several times higher than the the baryonic density, high enough that the <em>sum of both</em> is about 30% of critical density (&rho<sub>c</sub>)
</ol>
<p>
Just a few decades ago,  everyone thought that the traditional baryonic matter was 100% of "all there is" in the universe.   Amazingly, today it is considered to be just 3% to 5% of "all there is"!
<p>
Incidentally,  for those of you on Internet Explorer, the Greek letter for capital omega is <font face=symbol>W</font>, obviously a rather odd letter.   Again, if you want to know the reason for these coding quirks, see <A HREF="App11.html">Appendix 11</A>.]
 </font>
 </blockquote>
      
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The problem is that the <em>visible</em> matter in the universe (mostly
stars in galaxies) comprises about 1% of critical density.   On the other
hand, astronomers have noticed that the outer arms of spiral galaxies rotate
nearly as fast as the inner arms.   The most logical inference for this effect
is a considerable amount of undetected matter - around 10 times as much as
the matter we actually see - far outside the spiral structure so obvious
on photographs.    </p>
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Researchers have been able to stretch the density up to around 30%
of expected critical density.   The other 70% is rather elusive and, if the
inflationary model with critical density is correct, it's fascinating to
realize that the overwhelming majority of "stuff" in the universe is in a
form we do not yet know.   The best guess is that at least some (all?) of
the balance of the expected critical density is the negative energy implied
in the cosmological constant.   </p>
    <p> </p>
    <blockquote> <font color="red">[If &rho<sub>m</sub>
 is the density of matter, we could say &rho<sub>
vac</sub> is the density of "non-matter" or the "repulsive energy". The cosmic
"gospel" continues to preach (or suspect) that the <em>total density</em>
 of everything in the universe still equals the critical density (so that
      &rho<sub>m</sub> + &rho<sub>
vac</sub> = &rho<sub>c</sub> above).
      <p>If we then  say that &Omega<sub>
vac</sub> = &rho<sub>vac</sub>/&rho<sub>c</sub>, we still get a "flat" universe if, and only if (using
Ned Wright's "lingo"), &Omega<sub>m</sub> +  &Omega<sub>vac</sub> = 1.   Today most astronomers assume that &Omega<sub>m</sub> = 0.3 and &Omega<sub>vac</sub>
 = 0.7, which still gives them a flat universe, since the sum equals one.   A few others believe that the latest evidence indicates a sum a little greater than one, which gives them a closed universe.]
</font> 
</p>
</blockquote>
        
      <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The physical composition of the estimated 70% of "non matter" or
"repulsive force" - that is, whatever causes <font face="symbol">W</font><sub>
vac</sub> to assume a non zero value - is without question one of the major
challenges in modern cosmology. </p>
      <p> 
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Or is it? </p>
      <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>There's an understandable tendency to look for the solution to
a challenging problem in terms of your own discipline.   Since most astronomers
come up through the ranks of physics, it's understandable that they look
for a solution in physics. </p>
      <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>But once you "look under the hood" you realize (from Essay #3)
there is at least one possibility for a "lite density"  universe in topology. 
      </p>
      <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The Hubble parameter H is determined in the above formula with
the implicit assumption that it occurs in "singly-connected space", that
is, the V<sup>3</sup> space in the (x,y,z,t) Friedmann models.   But if the
Hubble parameter occurs in a universe expanding in (x,y,z,w,t) with multiply-connected
space in S<sup>3</sup>, then, even if we succeed in determining the Hubble
parameter with remarkable precision, it's still too high,  because the <em>
actual, slower</em> rate of expansion relative to the singularity occurs
along a hidden radius we don't notice (for  <a href="hierarchy(1).html#expanding">
the reason</a> given in Essay #1). </p>
      <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>And if H is too high, then the above formula indicates that the
critical density is also too high, since it depends on H<sup>2</sup>. </p>
      <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>If we have a Riemannian hypersphere that shrinks to zero size when
we look around it exactly one time, <a href="App10.html">Appendix 10</a> shows
that the ratio of its curved circumference to the radius is <font face="symbol">
p</font>.   If we were interested in determining the true value of expansion
relative to the collapsed receding site, we would take the <em>observed</em>
 value of expansion along the S<sup>2</sup> "surface" and divide it by <font face="symbol">
p</font> </p>
      <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Should the universe <em>be</em> a four-space hypersphere (five-space,
with time), the well established range of H is inflated because what we observe
is occurring in multiply-connected space, that is, along the intrinsically
curved surface of the hypersphere.   A better approximation of the <em>true</em>
 value of H (along the radius) is to assume the <em>observed</em> expansion
rate in the current era is roughly <font face="symbol">p</font> too high.
  </p>
      <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>It's interesting to note that in round numbers the density seemed
to be understated by a factor of about ten for decades (the 1% visible matter
plus the inferred dark matter ten times that amount in galaxies), which is
 approximately <font face="symbol">p</font><sup>2</sup>.   Note that  <font face="symbol">
p</font> is a reasonable approximation for the difference between the expansion
of we would <em>observe</em> along the S<sup>3</sup> surface of a Riemannian
hypersphere and its radius in V<sup>4</sup>, provided we assume the hypersphere
collapses to zero size when we looked around it once. </p>
      <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>So is the Hubble parameter we observe occurring in singly-connected
V<sup>3</sup> space or does it happen in multiply-connected S<sup>3</sup>
 space?    </p>
      <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>If nothing else, this discussion indicates we should check our
assumptions and make real sure we have the geometry right!   If cosmologists
were looking for a solution that did not involve a cosmological constant
and had to explain what we see in what is obviously a "lite density" universe,
this idea might have been taken more seriously a few years ago. </p>
      <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>However, since the cosmic priesthood feels quite comfortable with the cosmic gospel at the moment, this  "S<sup>3</sup> deception" is probably nothing more than an idle curiosity.

      <h4>
      <center>The Remarkable Homogeneity - Is It Another Clue For Riemannian
Space?</center>
      </h4>
 </font> 
<pre>

</pre>     
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> One of the most remarkable things about the universe is something
we all take for granted<strong>:</strong> we see "stuff" at all ages of the
universe.   However, what we observe at various lookback times varies considerably.
  For example, galaxies are much more commmon than quasars in the current
era, but quasars are roughly 1,000 times more common at red shifts just 
beyond z = 2 than they are in more recent eras.   And the hydrogen clouds
- the "stuff" from which galaxies are made and  commonly called "absorbers"
- are increasing exponentially at high red shifts. </p>
      <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Even though what we observe changes markedly with different lookback
times (because of evolution), there's <em>something</em> to see at virtually
every epoch in the universe. </p>
      <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Considering there was a unique moment in time billions of years
ago that the universe started to expand, just exactly how do we explain the
fact that some objects seem closer to the singularity than others.   Why
does matter in the universe appear largely homogeneous?   What formal mechanism
in the early universe caused this apparently uniform distribution of matter?
  And which of the two topological choices under consideration - V<sup>3</sup>
 or S<sup>3</sup> - better explains the homogeneous distribution? </p>
      <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>As we have done before, let's suppose we're on an elastically expanding
surface whose rate of expansion is H, the Hubble parameter, so many km/sec/mpc.
  And, as usual, we'll assume that we inhabitants on its surface don't know
whether it is flat (x,y,t) or curved (x,y,z,t).    But regardless of what
the true geometry is, the Hubble parameter <em>alone</em> allows us to deduce
the following: </p>
      <p> </p>
      <ol>
 
        <li>The elastic surface has an "age" which is determined by how long
ago (= 1/H seconds) it started to expand,  </li>
        <li>We cannot avoid looking toward the collapsed receding site in
virtually every direction though this site will be just beyond our Hubble
horizon because it is receding at the speed of light, c, and </li>
        <li>If H = constant for 1/H seconds, then the distance to the collapsed
site is c/H. </li>
      </ol>
 Again, all these statements are true whether the surface is curved or not. 
      <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Next we'll add just one other characteristic<strong>:</strong>
the surface has a homogeneous distribution. </p>
      <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The actual universe has something like 100 billion galaxies.  
So we'll also assume this plane or spherical surface (whatever it turns out
to be) intersects enough of the 100 billion galaxies  so that the intersection
accurately reflects the global homogeneous behavior of the distribution through
space and time.   In other words, it's a statistically fair sample and a
legitimate cross section of the universe. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <blockquote> <font color="red"> [Note<strong>:</strong> the actual
distribution of galaxies in the universe is not quite homogeneous, as they
tend to occur in groupings at various red shifts, called "large-scale structures",
with huge voids in between.   While not ignoring such structures, I'm still
assuming a homogeneous distribution for the sake of illustration.] </font>
 </blockquote>
 
        <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>For the moment, let's assume that the very high number of galaxies
which intersect this surface all occupied virtually the same Euclidean point
at t = 0 and then started to move away from this position at right angles
        <em>to a spherical surface</em> once t &gt; 0, although no one on
this 3D spherical surface has figured that out yet.   At any given moment
in time, these galaxies are moving away from the central location at the
same speed, though that speed may change over time; it may either accelerate
or decelerate, and the change always occurs globally at any given time in
all directions. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <blockquote> <font color="red"> [So we are negating the initial assumption
that H = constant over time.] </font> </blockquote>
 
          <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>We're deposited on the surface sometime after the surface
has been expanding.   We don't know its true structure yet, although there
are several things we have figured out: (1) it's elastic, (2) it's expanding,
and (3) its distribution of galaxies is homogeneous.   Our initial assumption
is that the galaxies are moving along the two spatial dimensions that are
obvious in V<sup>2</sup> (because our first impression is that we occupy
a flat two-dimensional plane).   However, these galaxies are really moving
along a hidden dimension in V<sup>3</sup>, at right angles to the S<sup>2</sup>
 surface. </p>
          <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>If the surface were truly flat in (x,y,t) or V<sup>2</sup>,
we might wonder about the formal mechanism at t = 0 which apparently caused
some galaxies to expand faster than others.    </p>
          <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>On other hand, if we assume the galaxies were expanding on
a spherical surface defined in (x,y,z,t) then all of them can move away uniformly
in virtually every direction from the collapsed receding site at the same
rate (at right angles to the surface) and still be perfectly homogeneous,
no matter where we happen to be on the surface and no matter if the rate
of expansion changes at certain times. </p>
          <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>In order to feel comfortable with the Friedmann models we would
have to suppose that a cross section which resembles an expanding 2D trampoline
mat in (x,y,t) or V<sup>2</sup> is the best explanation for the homogeneous
distribution.    But I can't do that because, while openly conceding it is
primarily an intuitive feeling, it seems to me the better way to accommodate
the homogeneous distribution of the galaxies is to assume that a 3D spherical
surface in (x,y,z,t) or S<sup>2</sup> is more likely to be a "slice" of the
universe, rather than the 2D trampoline mat in (x,y,t). </p>
          <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Whichever cross section we prefer is projected to occur in
another dimension (via the analysis in <a href="App2.html">Appendix 2</a>
).   If you agree with the intuitive argument that the homogeneous distribution
is easier to explain by assuming it occurs on a surface expanding in (x,y,z,t)
or S<sup>2</sup>, then you should agree just as much that a homogeneous distribution
of matter is far easier to explain in a hyperspheric universe expanding in
(x,y,z,w,t) or S<sup>3</sup>, rather than spherical model expanding in (x,y,z,t)
or V<sup>3</sup>. </p>
          <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Again, whatever happens in S<sup>2</sup> happens in S<sup>3</sup>, and vice versa. </p>
          <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Carl Sagan once said: "An extraordinary claim requires extraordinary
proof!" </p>
          <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>To those who say "Prove it!" with respect to the existence
of a fourth spatial dimension, my reply is "Look around you!   The homogeneous
distribution of matter is much easier to explain by assuming that the fourth
spatial dimension is there!"    As a rule, the simplest explanation in nature
is usually the right one - it's called the Occam Razor solution - and I believe
that the homogeneous distribution of matter is easier to explain in a universe
expanding in (x,y,z,w,t) - that is, in S<sup>3</sup>/V<sup>4</sup> - than
it is in the conventional "flat" Friedmann model in (x,y,z,t) or V<sup>3</sup>
. </p>
          <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The next four essays examine briefly some of the observational
anomalies in deep space and see if they fit any of the unusual predictions
caused by an antipode that is supposed to be there in Riemannian space.  </p>
