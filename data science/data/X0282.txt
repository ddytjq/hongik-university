<h3> Taking the Lid Off the Basket - Challenging 
Conventional Shooting Wisdom!</h3>

<p><i>(Article #4 in a Series for The Basketball Highway:&nbsp; &quot;The 
Trouble with Shooting!&quot; by Tom Nordland, Shooting 
Coach)</i></p>

<p> <b> COACHES:&nbsp;</b> I would like to suggest you re-evaluate some 
shooting instruction &quot;rules&quot; that are in common use today.&nbsp; I feel a 
different approach to this coaching could result in dramatic improvement in 
your players' shooting skills.&nbsp; The purpose isn't necessarily to throw 
out ideas, but to encourage you to communicate more clearly the 
specific techniques and understandings that lead to better 
shooting.</p><p>In my experience researching and coaching shooting for the past 
10 years at all levels, from beginner to the NBA, I've been coming up against 
the coaching my students have been given over their basketball lives.&nbsp; 
Some of it has been beneficial, for example, &quot;Use more legs,&quot; &quot;Be 
in balance,&quot; or &quot;Hold the follow through.&quot;&nbsp; However, more often than 
not, the student has perceived (or misperceived) coaching in ways I 
think sabotage good shooting.</p>

<p>The three instructions I wish to focus on are:&nbsp; 
<ol>
<li>Squaring Up</li>
<li>Shooting at the Top of the Jump</li>
<li>Wrist Flipping.</li>
</ol>

<p>Dale Davis of the Indiana Pacers was able to make a major 
improvement in his shooting last season by adopting a different approach to 
these instructions.&nbsp; He was formerly standing almost square, shot at the 
top of his jump (or his down-up free throw motion), and threw the 
ball horizontally with upper body muscles.&nbsp; With my coaching, he's 
opened more his stance, shoots on the way up (for both free throws and 
jump shots), and now releases the ball with a simple, upward pushing 
action. The result was a 15% increase in free throw performance (from 46.5% 
to 61.8%) which resulted in more aggressive play and being left in the 
game at the end of close games.&nbsp; His confidence is beginning to soar, and 
we expect him to improve another 15% or more from the Line this 
season.</p>

<p>Let me make an argument for a different interpretation of 
these instructions.&nbsp; The arguments and results may persuade you to change 
the way you coach this critical skill.&nbsp; And I also believe this 
different approach to the coaching of shooting CAN be implemented during 
the season.&nbsp; See at the end for my explanation of why that's 
possible.</p>

<p><b>1)&nbsp; SQUARING UP</b></p>

<p>The first instruction I'd like to 
question is this one.&nbsp; This summer when I asked over 250 kids in Clinics I 
gave in Minnesota if they had been told to &quot;Square Up&quot; when they shoot, at 
least 80% said they had. When I asked them what was meant by that 
instruction, they told me they were told to have their lower and upper bodies 
oriented exactly facing the basket.</p><p>To &quot;Square Up&quot; literally means to 
have a line across your shoulders be perpendicular to a line from your chest 
to the basket.&nbsp; For free throws, it means lining up both feet at the line and 
keeping feet, knees, hips and shoulders in this &quot;square to the target&quot; 
position.&nbsp; You can see in John Stockton, All Star guard for the Utah Jazz, a 
squared-up stance. With free throws and jump shots, he orients directly at 
the basket. However, I'll guess he was also told to have a vertical forearm, 
so, rather than force his elbow in and have the ball over his head, 
he shoots with the ball off his right shoulder, thus satisfying 
both needs.&nbsp; However, the problem in shooting this way is that he has 
to calculate an angle from where his eyes are and where the center of 
the ball is (8-10&quot; to his right).&nbsp; He can't shoot directly at the 
basket from his visual perspective.&nbsp; He's become very good at this 
calculation and shoots amazingly well, but he is not as accurate or 
consistent as Jeff Hornacek, also of the Jazz, who turns his body approx. 45° 
and has his eyes directly under the ball.</p><p>If by Square Up you mean 
simply to generally &quot;Face the Basket&quot; as you go to shoot and stop any lateral 
and rotational movement as you begin the shot, then it can be an effective 
instruction.&nbsp; I think this is what most coaches conceive the instruction to 
mean.&nbsp; However, from what I've seen and heard, I think most students 
misperceive it and get the literal meaning and wind up physically Squaring 
Up.&nbsp; Perhaps this instruction needs to be changed to &quot;Face Up,&quot; or something 
like that.</p><p>From my experience, it's more natural to &quot;Open&quot; the body and 
rotate to the left for right handers, right for left-handers.&nbsp; This also 
makes the forearm of the shooting arm more vertical without tension, and 
allows the Shooting Arm to extend more easily toward the basket.&nbsp; The 
Guide Hand just moves aside and hangs back.</p><p>Try shooting both Squared 
Up and Open and see which feels more natural. Offer your players both options 
and observe which they adopt naturally. If you watch good shooters, most of 
them rotate at least a little naturally.</p><p>Squaring Up is probably an 
instruction from the old Two Handed Days. For two handed set shots and free 
throws, being square to the target is vital.&nbsp; But in today's One-Handed Shot 
game, most players want to turn. In video clips I've seen of Larry Bird, he, 
like Hornacek, turned about 45°.&nbsp; I believe any athlete who hasn't been 
forced to Square Up will turn naturally when told to shoot the ball with one 
hand/arm.</p><p><b>THE COMMON (MIS-) UNDERSTANDING:&nbsp; </b>That Squaring Up somehow gets 
you in better connection and alignment with the basket or helps with the 
shot motion.&nbsp; With this position, the elbow wants to be out to the side, 
like in a salute, and if you want your forearm to be sort-of-vertical 
and your palm facing the basket for an 
easy, straight-in-line-with-the-basket motion, you have to force the 
elbow in.&nbsp; This creates tension in the setup, and, if you try to keep 
your body in that relationship, that tension will be maintained in 
the Release.</p><p><b>MY APPROACH:</b>&nbsp; Let the body turn naturally and see what 
works best. Compare Squaring Up with turning 10°, 20°, 30°, 40° or more.&nbsp; I 
like the idea of being &quot;aligned&quot; when I shoot, with target, ball, hand, 
forearm, eyes, body and legs generally in alignment, and if you Open the 
stance, this seems to happen more easily.&nbsp; Test it out.&nbsp; See which stance 
gives your players the feeling of being more &quot;under and behind&quot; the 
ball. Which one creates less tension?&nbsp; There's no one right answer here.&nbsp; 
Each person needs to find what works for him or her.&nbsp; To me, everything 
seems to be naturally aligned if you're more Open.&nbsp; And if you're 
aligned, Accuracy is much more assured.</p><p> <b> 2)&nbsp; SHOOTING AT THE TOP OF 
THE JUMP</b></p><p>The second common instruction I'd like to question is the old 
&quot;Shoot at the top (or apex) of your jump.&quot;</p><p>This idea has been around a 
long time.&nbsp; I found a book in the San Jose library by one of the legends of 
the game, written in 1966, that stated very clearly you should NOT use any of 
the jumping motion in the shot. Rather, you should wait until the top of the 
jump and then shoot.&nbsp; When I asked the kids if they had been told this 
instruction, about the same number said &quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p>I think most coaches 
know that leg power is effective in powering and controlling a shot.&nbsp; This 
instruction is probably conceived to help players elevate them to shoot over 
an opponent.&nbsp; It may also be to try to make the leg drive consistent.&nbsp; 
However, if it is literally perceived by the students, they wait until there 
is no lower body power left and then shoot, thus sabotaging the 
shot.</p><p>This instruction is interesting in another way, because many of 
these same players tell me they've also been told to shoot higher.&nbsp; I'm 
sure their coaches explained that the basket is larger and more forgiving 
for a shot coming in at a high angle.&nbsp; (60% above horizontal is 
considered by many to be the most effective angle.)&nbsp; We know that upward 
action of the leg drive or leg lift ? what I call UpForceT ? creates a 
high arching shot.&nbsp; So, if you're told to wait and shoot at the top of 
the jump, then this upward power source is missed and all you've got left 
is arm, wrist, hand and finger power.&nbsp; And these latter power sources 
are mostly horizontal!</p><p>When I was at the Big Man Camp in Hawaii this 
summer, almost every one of the 24 NBA and ~30 College participants was 
shooting at the top of his jump.&nbsp; And the shooting percentages I observed of 
open, uncontested mid-range jumpers were very low for most of these great 
players (in the 25-30% range).&nbsp; I feel the instruction and the results are 
directly related.</p><p>The trajectory of a shot is important.&nbsp; In shooting 
a basketball, lower body muscles tend to create a vertical action and upper 
body muscles tend to create a horizontal action.&nbsp; If we agree that we want a 
high arching shot, then the former muscles are to be favored.&nbsp; Note that 
an arm straightening motion by itself can be horizontal or vertical as 
you choose, but without leg power, its force is limited.&nbsp; And if you 
bring the ball too far overhead, then the arm motion has to become a throw 
or sling, and the direction of the motion becomes mostly horizontal.&nbsp; 
Check it out.&nbsp; Bring a ball to a Set Point way overhead and notice what 
is required to launch a ball without leg power and what kind of arch 
is created.</p><p>Conversely, if you shoot on the way up, there is powerful, 
upward energy available to shoot from, and this creates the arch everyone 
wants ... naturally.&nbsp; Don't worry about making this power consistent.&nbsp; It's 
going to vary all over the place, depending on fatigue, adrenalin, 
the distance to the basket, the quickness of the shot, etc.&nbsp; Varying arch 
is how you manage that.&nbsp; And when shooting on the way up, the 
Release happens more quickly.</p><p>If you have to jump over people, as 
centers and power forwards sometimes have to do, then waiting until near the 
top of the jump can be effective.&nbsp; However, I suggest that even with these 
shots you shoot before you reach the top of the jump so you can still use 
some of the upward energy to stabilize the shot.&nbsp; If you shoot at the very 
top or, god forbid, on the way down, you greatly minimize your chances 
of success.</p><p>Adam Keefe of the Utah Jazz discovered the importance of 
shooting on the way up, shooting from what he's come to know as &quot;The Wave.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Though his stance was already open when he came to me, he discovered he 
was releasing the ball at the top of his jump and wrist flipping.&nbsp; From 
a shaky 69% in free throws the prior 3 years, he shot in the 
mid-80's through most of the '97-98 season until a foot injury destabilized 
his lower body action and he wound up making 81% for the year (still 
an impressive 12% increase in one season).&nbsp; This summer he has more 
deeply learned the distinction of shooting from the wave of energy the 
lower body provides, and free throws and jump shots are becoming easier 
and easier for him.&nbsp; He's poised for a terrific shooting year.</p><p>I don't 
think you have to jump high for most Jump Shots.&nbsp; The idea of jumping over 
people is left for a very few great athletes and for Centers and Power 
Forwards working in close.&nbsp; Most players get open for a moment and need to 
get the shot off quickly before the defender reacts or recovers.&nbsp; The height 
of the jump doesn't really matter that much.&nbsp; A quick Release and a high, 
soft ball flight are created by shooting on the way up.</p><p>Watch great 
shooters like Detlef Schrempf, now of the Portland Trailblazers, Hornacek of 
the Jazz, and Steve Kerr of the San Antonio Spurs.&nbsp; They shoot early in their 
jumping motions.&nbsp; Rik Smits of Indiana, 7'4&quot; and one of the better big men 
shooters, shoots very early in the jump, too.&nbsp; One of Stanford's best 
shooters ever is Ryan Mendez, from Texas (He averaged 38 pts/game in high 
school a few years ago). He's 6'7&quot; and he shoots as early in the jumping 
motion as possible. That, to me, is why he's such a great shooter.&nbsp; Every one 
I've seen who has learned to shoot earlier in the jumping motion improved 
shooting performance.</p><p><b>THE COMMON (MIS-) UNDERSTANDING:&nbsp; </b>I guess the 
idea here is that being higher in the air helps somehow in the shot, and 
also, if you isolate the shot to just the upper body, you employ fewer 
muscles.&nbsp; I don't think height above the ground makes any difference, but I 
think the higher you are the less you will think to aim &quot;upward&quot; to shoot.&nbsp; 
Tall players tend to shoot flat and short players shoot high because of 
this difference in perspective.&nbsp; And shorter players are usually 
better shooters.&nbsp; The better big men shooters shoot high, despite their 
height.</p><p>The problem is if you shoot literally at the top of your jumping 
(or free throw/set shot) motion, you will have expended all the 
upward energy of the legs.&nbsp; All you have left to shoot with are upper 
body muscles.&nbsp; Fewer muscles, yes, but these muscles (arm, wrist, hand 
and fingers) are very intricate and complex, designed for fine motor 
control and are more sensitive to slight adjustments.&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of 
shooting, they also create mostly horizontal energy.&nbsp; When you're wanting 
the fewest possible variables -- a repeatable motion -- these finer 
muscles are less reliable.&nbsp; Making them into a &quot;constant&quot; motion, just a 
simple pushing action with relaxed wrist and hand, gives you that ... and 
the corresponding control you want. Also, you miss the powerful, 
stabilizing force created by lower body power (legs, hips, pelvis, back), 
your strongest muscles.&nbsp; shooting at the top of the jump is like missing 
a Wave in surfing.</p><p><b>MY APPROACH:&nbsp;</b> Shoot on the way up.&nbsp; See what 
shooting earlier in the jumping motion does for you.&nbsp; Try earlier and earlier 
and see what happens.&nbsp; For most outside jump shots, I feel that you don't 
have to wait at all to shoot.&nbsp; Go for the maximum leg drive percentage 
available and see what happens.&nbsp; (And I don't mean jumping stronger; I just 
mean shooting earlier and quicker in whatever body/leg force you 
generate.)</p><p>You'll find your shots go higher, without trying for height, 
and you'll have a quicker Release and plenty of power.&nbsp; You'll start to 
experience the shot as &quot;effortless.&quot;&nbsp; As mentioned above, the UpForceT 
also stabilizes the shot with its powerful force field.&nbsp; If you're in 
very close and need to jump strongly to shoot over a defender, you can wait 
a bit (call it &quot;hangtime&quot;) before releasing the ball.&nbsp; But shoot 
always from at least some of the lower body energy for the advantages 
it offers.&nbsp; You can also raise your Set Point, if in close, so you 
can shoot more quickly and more &quot;full out.&quot;</p><p> <b> 3)&nbsp; WRIST FLIPPING THE 
BALL</b></p><p>And finally a large majority of the kids in my Clinics said they 
were told to &quot;flip their wrists&quot; to power the shot.&nbsp; Now, if you're 
shooting at the top of your jump and have missed the UpForceT wave, all you 
have left is arm, wrist and hand/finger power.&nbsp; In that case, flipping 
the wrist makes sense.&nbsp; You could also &quot;throw&quot; or &quot;sling&quot; the ball with 
the arm and even power the shot with the fingers.&nbsp; A fairly well 
known shooting coach taught powering the ball with the first two fingers.&nbsp; 
But these forces are less reliable and horizontal and results will 
be streaky at best.&nbsp; Wrist flipping or Throwing may give you more power 
and distance, but the negatives of the flatness of the shot, 
the variability, and the susceptibility to pressure negate any 
advantage.</p><p>A common image of the Follow Through in shooting is what's 
called &quot;Reaching the hand in the cookie jar.&quot;&nbsp; Another is the &quot;Goose 
neck.&quot; These images, especially the first one, imply doing something with 
the wrist and hand, like reaching into something.&nbsp;&nbsp; The wrist 
flipping instruction may come from this.&nbsp; The problem I see in fulfilling 
this image is that you're introducing unnecessary tension.</p><p>I coached a 
young assistant coach at a major basketball power on the West Coast a few 
years ago.&nbsp; I asked him to warm up first and observed him shoot about 15 
consecutive airballs.&nbsp; When I asked him what he was doing, he said, &quot;I'm 
trying to reach my hand in the cookie jar.&quot; Obviously he didn't know what he 
was doing; he misperceived the instruction and it interfered badly with his 
performance.</p><p>An alternative way to shoot is to keep the wrist, hand and 
finger muscles quiet, and power the shot instead with just an upward 
pushing action of the arm supported by a strong leg drive.&nbsp; From my 
perspective, if you make the arm action a constant -- just a straightening of 
the arm at the same speed and force every time (at about 75% of maximum, so 
you don't hurt yourself) -- it minimizes variables and gives you what I 
call &quot;Repeatability.&quot;&nbsp; I like to call this a &quot;Full Out&quot; Release.&nbsp; If 
your wrist and hand are relaxed, the hand will actually &quot;bounce&quot; when 
you Release the ball.&nbsp; The more it bounces, the more relaxed those 
muscles are.&nbsp; A relaxed wrist and hand look somewhat like reaching a hand 
into something, but there is no &quot;reach&quot; and no tension ? it's just the&nbsp; 
way the hand looks when the wrist is relaxed.&nbsp; I have a photo of me in 
1957 on my Website, home page.&nbsp; Notice how my hand is relaxed, just 
hanging there.</p><p>Dale Davis has come to understand the concept of 
Repeatability in shooting, as shown in his description of my coaching this 
fall:&nbsp; &quot;His [Tom's] technique is different from most shooting coaches.&nbsp; He 
does a combination of form and the art/science of&nbsp; repeatability.&nbsp; It 
really works!&quot;</p><p>The last variable, a pressure valve of sorts, becomes 
the arch or height of your shot.&nbsp; As you shoot, be ready to adjust the height 
every time, based on what you feel, how strong the jump is, how quickly 
you're shooting, etc.&nbsp; That way, you can always go &quot;Full Out&quot; with 
your Release, keeping it constant, but simply varying the angle of the 
push. Varying arch is one of the characteristics of most great 
shooting.</p><p>Great shooters have minimized the variables in their shot 
motions and developed a way to shoot over and over with basically the same 
motion. The fewer muscles involved, the more this becomes possible.&nbsp; This is 
the idea of &quot;Repeatability&quot; (or automated or programmed skills).&nbsp; 
Superior performers in all sports develop motions that can go on automatic.&nbsp; 
That permits them to move all their attention from mechanics to the 
target. And that makes a huge difference.</p><p><b>THE COMMON (MIS-)
        UNDERSTANDING:</b>&nbsp; The misconception or misperception is that using the wrist is 
an effective power source.&nbsp; It will give you extra power, that's true.&nbsp; But 
it's horizontal power and it's hard to control.&nbsp; The wrist, hand and fingers 
are the smallest muscles in the chain from your feet through your body up to 
and through your arms.&nbsp; It doesn't make sense to me to leave control of the 
flight of the ball, distance and direction, with the smallest muscles.&nbsp; The 
fine motor control they provide is subject to variation, especially under 
pressure.</p><p><b>MY APPROACH:</b>&nbsp; Make your upper body action a &quot;Pushing&quot; action of 
the arm (aimed upward) rather than any kind of Flipping or Throwing motion.&nbsp; 
And relax the wrist, hand and finger muscles.&nbsp; They don't have to do 
any powering, steering or guiding.&nbsp; They can just complete your 
connection with the ball and, by doing nothing more than that, ensure 
greater accuracy and consistency that comes from strong, stable lower body 
power and an arm motion aimed exactly where you want.&nbsp; The finger pads and 
the forward part of the palm are how you connect to the ball itself.&nbsp; 
A little pressure from the fingers ensures control of the ball, 
allowing it to roll off your fingers in a consistent way.&nbsp; Shooting this 
way you'll get the feeling of doing &quot;nothing&quot; with these smaller 
muscles, and the feeling of shooting becomes effortlessness when there's 
strong power from the lower body.&nbsp; And, surprise!!! ... you'll find you 
get perfect backspin!</p><p>One last thing about the Set Point:&nbsp; To do an 
upward pushing action with the arm to take advantage of the powerful leg 
drive, you cannot have taken the ball way over your head.&nbsp; Rather, it works 
best to have the back of the ball at approximately the front of the head or 
only very slightly behind the front of the head so you can push upward.&nbsp; This 
&quot;up front&quot; Set Point is also achieved more quickly and, with shooting 
from UpForceT, gives you a very quick Release.&nbsp; The bigger and stronger 
you are, the higher above your head you can establish the Set Point, 
thus making it more difficult to block.</p><p>As I said, don't just believe 
this or disbelieve it.&nbsp; Examine these three coaching instructions in this 
different light and let the results show you the most effective way to shoot 
and coach the skill of shooting.</p><p><b>A FINAL NOTE:&nbsp; CAN THIS BE INTRODUCED 
ONCE THE SEASON STARTS?</b></p><p>I say &quot;Yes, definitely,&quot; and I'll tell you why.&nbsp; 
I know many of you don't want to &quot;mess&quot; with your players' shots during the 
season.&nbsp; You feel that summer is the time for them to work on changes in 
their individual skills.</p><p>However, I feel when a change is not 
complicated and done in a spirit of &quot;awareness,&quot; rather than &quot;Do this,&quot; or 
&quot;Don't do that,&quot; change or learning can happen any time during a season!&nbsp; 
Humans are Learning Machines, we're born to learn, and we can learn new 
things quickly and easily, especially if they're simple and natural.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of 
course, you don't want to suggest a change the day before a crucial game, or 
in the timeout before a critical free throw.&nbsp; But in the many hours of a 
week and over a period of a few weeks, players can learn new things and 
learn to trust them.</p><p>I feel what I'm suggesting here can be just 
that:&nbsp; Simple and Natural. If your players become aware of how they stand and 
are given the option of &quot;Opening&quot; their stances, it becomes a &quot;Choice,&quot; not a 
rule.&nbsp; Choosing between different alternatives is how we learn.&nbsp; It's called 
making &quot;Distinctions,&quot; in this case, the Distinction of Stance.&nbsp; And once 
you have a Distinction, like balance on a bicycle, you never forget it.&nbsp; 
But if there's a lot of worry and doubt, &quot;trying&quot; hard to do 
something &quot;right,&quot; then learning becomes difficult.</p><p>If, for example, 
you just ask your players to note if they're shooting at the top of the jump 
or on the way up, you'll see instant learning. The rule &quot;Shoot at the top!&quot; 
can be replaced by &quot;See when you shoot and experiment with shooting earlier 
and later!&quot;&nbsp; What will happen is experimentation and discovery!&nbsp; They'll 
start to see that shooting earlier is more effective than later, and it 
creates a higher, more effortless shot.&nbsp; They'll start to see that shots 
become more stable and consistent.&nbsp; When they add the third notion ? of 
shooting with the whole arm, and not flipping with the wrist ? they'll 
discover a whole new way of shooting.</p><p>As the coach, it will be 
important to keep this atmosphere of learning and discovery going.&nbsp; Have team 
talks about shooting, what works and what doesn't work.&nbsp; When a player has a 
breakthrough, ask her or him to share it with the team with a demonstration 
and words.&nbsp; What was discovered and how?&nbsp; What does it feel like?&nbsp; Maybe that 
player's words will help others make similar discoveries.&nbsp; Ask the group to 
describe what they see.&nbsp; When players can see these simple principles in 
others, it will help seeing and feeling them in themselves.</p><p>In the 
end, remember that shooting is really very simple!&nbsp; If we complicate it, it 
becomes difficult for all but the few.&nbsp; And that's what we have in the game 
today, only a small percent of players can really control ball flight ... all 
the time!&nbsp; Sure, we have streaky shooters, and that's the best you can do 
when the shot motion is full of variables, flat and hot, a guess rather than 
a sure thing.&nbsp; Great shooters have a plan, a plan of controlled 
repeatability.&nbsp; The target has become their dominant focus, not mechanics or 
execution.&nbsp; They've learned to Let Go and Trust themselves in that &quot;golden 
moment of shooting,&quot; and in so doing they put the ball in or near dead 
center every time.&nbsp; And I believe the instructional ideas I've presented 
above can put your players on the path of becoming great shooters!</p><p>I 
invite your questions and would love to hear of your experiences 
with learning and coaching the great skill/art of shooting a basketball.</p>
