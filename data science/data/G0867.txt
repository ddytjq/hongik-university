<h1>
The COBE Far Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer (FIRAS)</h1>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>The objective of the FIRAS instrument is to measure precisely the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) spectrum and to observe the dust and line emission
from the Galaxy. It is a polarizing Michelson interferometer operated differentially
with an internal reference blackbody, and calibrated by an external blackbody
having an estimated emissivity of better than 0.9999 (Mather 1982, Opt.
Eng., 21, 769; <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1993SPIE%2E2019%2E%2E168M&db_key=INST">Mather,
Fixsen and Shafer 1993</a>; <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1994ApJ...420..457F">Fixsen
et al. 1994</a>; <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJ/v512n2/38652/38652.html">Mather
et al. 1999</a>).&nbsp; It covers the wavelength range from 0.1 to 10 mm
in two spectral channels separated at 0.5 mm and has approximately 5% spectral
resolution.&nbsp; A flared horn antenna aligned with the COBE spin axis
gives the FIRAS a 7 degree field of view.&nbsp; The instrument was cooled
to 1.5 K to reduce its thermal emission and enable the use of sensitive
bolometric detectors.&nbsp; The FIRAS ceased to operate when the COBE supply
of liquid helium was depleted on 21 September 1990, by which time it had
surveyed the sky 1.6 times.

<p>Original CMB measurement results were reported by <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1994ApJ...420..439M">Mather
et al. (1994)</a> using an early instrument calibration (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1994ApJ...420..457F">Fixsen
et al. 1994</a>), data from the most stable period of operation, and a
model of the Galaxy to subtract its effects. The resulting CMB temperature
was found to be 2.726 +/- 0.010 K over the wavelength range from 0.5 to
5 mm.&nbsp; Over this range the maximum deviation from the blackbody form
is less than 0.03%, with a weighted rms value of only 0.01%. Fits to the
dimensionless cosmic distortion parameters give 95% confidence limits of
|mu/kT| &lt; 3.3 x 10<sup>-4</sup> and |y| &lt; 2.5 x 10<sup>-5</sup> respectively.
The implications of these limits for cosmological models were summarized
by <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1994ApJ...420..450W">Wright
et al. (1993)</a>.
<p>The dipole anisotropy of the CMB, presumed due to our peculiar motion
relative to the Hubble flow, can be seen clearly in the FIRAS data (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1994ApJ...420..445F">Fixsen
et al. 1994</a>), which show for the first time that the spectrum of the
dipole is that expected from the Doppler shift acting on a blackbody spectrum.
<p>FIRAS results also include the first nearly all-sky, unbiased, far infrared
survey of the Galactic emission at wavelengths greater than 120 microns.&nbsp;
The total far infrared luminosity of the Galaxy is inferred to be 1.8 (+/-
0.6) x 10<sup>10</sup> L<sub>Sun</sub> (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1991ApJ...381..200W">Wright
et al. 1991</a>).
<p>Spectral lines from interstellar [C I], [C II], [N II], and CO were
detected, and the lines of [C II] at 158 microns and [N II] at 205.3 microns
were sufficiently strong to be mapped (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1991ApJ...381..200W">Wright
et al. 1991</a>; <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJ/v526n1/39372/39372.html">Fixsen
et al. 1999</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the first observation of the 205.3
micron line. The [C II] line is interpreted as coming from photodissociation
regions and the [N II] line as partially arising from a diffuse warm ionized
medium and partially arising from dense H II regions.
<p>The final FIRAS CMB spectrum measurements were reported by
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1996ApJ...473..576F&db_key=AST&high=38a04f853505208">Fixsen
et al. (1996)</a> and <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJ/v512n2/38652/38652.html">Mather
et al. (1999)</a>. Mather et al., using an improved understanding of the
FIRAS calibrator, give the definitive CMB temperature: 2.725&plusmn;0.002
K.
