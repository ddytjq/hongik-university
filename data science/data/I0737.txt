and<br>												<br>												To comply with IAAF published guidelines.<br>												</font></p>											</ul>											<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#231428">The EB Report (based upon an 80,000 Olympic capacity) was placed in the public domain by the Secretary of State prior to WNSL having the opportunity to evaluate the findings of that report or provide a considered response.<br>											<br>											This report provides WNSL's response and clearly demonstrates that the Secretary of State's conclusions are not consistent with WNSL's analysis.<br>											<br>											WNSL have studied the EB Report with their Design Team, and it is apparent it contains many errors and is very misleading. WNSL are able to systematically refute each of the claims within the EB Report, which suggest the stadium has major shortcomings for athletics.<br>											<br>											It is therefore WNSL's conclusion that the Secretary of State may have reached conclusions based on a flawed report.<br>											<br>											In relation to athletics WNSL are not specifically required within the Lottery Funding Agreement to comply with any IOC guidelines, nor to provide 80,000 seats for the Olympic Games. WNSL are required to deliver a stadium unencumbered by existing commercial rights in the event of the Olympic Games being secured.<br>											<br>											</font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#3e2447"><b>The EB Report is flawed in that:</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#231428"><br>											</font></p>											<ul>												<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#231428">It contains factual errors;<br>												It refers to non-existent requirements from regulating bodies;<br>												It is inconsistent; and<br>												It does not acknowledge common sporting practice.<br>												</font></p>											</ul>											<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#231428">The EB Report does not recognise that the current design is at an early stage in terms of definitive drawings and therefore many details have not been worked up.<br>											<br>											</font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#3e2447"><b>With regard to the particular issues included in the Secretary of State's statement to the House of Commons WNSL's responses are as follows:</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#231428"><br>											<br>											</font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#3e2447"><b>Sightlines:</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#231428"> The sightlines of the stadium have been designed to achieve an optimum balance and bring spectators as close to the action as possible for all three sports. The standards have been agreed with Sport England and UK Athletics and are similar to the Stade de France. In terms of WNSL's contractual obligations, the proposal does not provide unacceptable compromises between the three sports and it does provide unrestricted views as far as practically possible given the basic incompatibility between football and athletics.<br>											<br>											</font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#3e2447"><b>Partial Roof Coverage of the Track:</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#231428"> This issue has been fully explored with Sport England, UK Athletics and the IAAF and none of these bodies have raised an objection. It is not uncommon for stadia roofs to partially cover some lanes of the running track. This is the case at the Gottlieb-Daimler Stadium (Stuttgart), the Stade de France and the Malaysian National Stadium. The new Manchester Commonwealth Games Stadium will also have the stadium roof partly covering the track.<br>											<br>											</font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#3e2447"><b>Seating Space:</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#231428"> Individual seating space for general spectators will be well above the minimum standards set down in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds &quot;Green Guide&quot; and is not matched by any existing ground in the UK. Space for spectators will be more generous than both Twickenham and Stade de France and will be comparable to Stadium Australia.<br>											<br>											The EB Report states that there is an Olympic requirement in terms of seat sizes, this is not the case and the WNSL seat size proposals would be acceptable for an Olympic event.<br>											<br>											</font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#3e2447"><b>Athletics Deck Access:</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#231428"> The design makes full provision for allowing the necessary access to the athletics arena for athletes, officials and equipment by ramps from the lower level.<br>											<br>											</font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#3e2447"><b>Stadium Alignment:</b> </font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#231428">The norm for a football stadium is a north-south axis and this used to be necessary in pre-war grounds to prevent a low sun shining in the goalkeeper's eyes. The Wembley alignment has therefore always been unusual in terms of accepted standards and due to the height of the stand in practice has never proved to be a problem for football. In the new stadium there will continue to be no problem for football, as the stand will be twice as high.<br>											<br>											As the height of the seating bowl will shield athletes from the glare of a setting sun the IAAF has no objection to the proposed east-west alignment.<br>											<br>											An additional benefit of the east/west alignment is that it creates a fully lit pitch avoiding the shadow problems experienced at the Stade de France, which give rise to such poor TV coverage.<br>											<br>											</font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#3e2447"><b>Stadium Closure Time:</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#231428"> Stadium closure for athletics conversion is limited only to the time required for deck construction and dismantling, which each take 6 months or less. With the deck in place international standard football matches can be played inside the athletics track at deck level, apart from a few weeks immediately before or after an athletics event. This is exactly the same as in other stadia throughout the world, which have an athletics track surrounding the football pitch.<br>											<br>											WNSL is totally committed to building a world class stadium capable of hosting all three sports and is confident that the proposed design fully meets all needs for the staging of top level athletics, including the Olympics. The innovative design strategy, which uses the latest technology in pre-fabricated construction methods and materials, is an excellent solution for allowing major athletics on a once in a lifetime basis and which meanwhile ensures that the spectator experience for football/rugby will be second to none.<br>											<br>											Contained within the body of this report is a rebuttal of every point made in the EB Report, which clearly demonstrates that WNSL has honoured its contractual obligations and that the proposed stadium can host world class track and field events and the Olympics.<br>											<br>											WNSL are confident that when the Secretary of State reviews this report, it will be clear that the EB Report does not support the conclusions which have been drawn, nor the need for WNSL to refer the project back to the drawing board.<br>											<br>											</font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#3e2447"><b>Also available for download from this site are the full Ellerbe Becket and Select Committee Reports:<br>											</b></font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#231428"><br>											</font><a href="ellerbe_report.pdf"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#3e2447">Click here to view the Ellerbe Becket Report</font></a><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#3e2447"> (in PDF format)</font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#231428"><br>											</font><a href="select_committee.htm"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#3e2447">Click here to view the Select Committee Report</font></a><font size="2" color="#3e2447"><br>											</font></div>									</td>								</tr>								<tr>									<td width="180" align="left" valign="bottom">
