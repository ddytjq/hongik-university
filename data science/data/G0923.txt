<h1>Deep Sky collections and catalogs similar to Messier's</h1>
</center>

This list is also available in a slightly more 
<a href="catalogs.html">systematically organized format</a>
<p>

Besides the more comprehensive professional catalogs which came into use 
after <a href="../history/m-cat.html">Messier's list</a>, several similar 
lists have been compiled, first because Messier had not captured all 
showpieces even in the Northern skies (he simply cataloged what came into 
his field of view, more or less by chance, and what he could measure), 
and he never went to the Southern hemisphere (not even to latitudes south 
of Paris, which is at about 49 degrees Northern latitude).
This lack of completeness, connected with a certain arbitrariness, gave rise
to several people to fill in with similar object collections, although these
are not of the same importance in 
<a href="../history/CMessier.html">history</a>.
Some of these catalogs are available online and listed below:

<ul>
<li>Several <i>smaller</i> catalogs of historical importance are given in our 
  <a href="../history/deepskyd.html">History of Deep Sky Discovery</a> page;
  this includes <a href="halley.html"><i>Halley</i>'s 6-object catalog</a>.
  We also hold some of the other 
  <a href="histcat.html">historical catalogs</a>; 
  some of them may still be interesting for amateur workthrough.
<li><a href="../history/lacaille.html"><i>Lacaille</i>'s 
  "Catalogue of Nebulae of the Southern Sky"</a> 
  may be of special interest due to its historical relevance
  (also <a href="lacaille.txt">available as ascii file</a>).
  We also have a copy of the 
  <a href="../history/lac-cat.html">original Lacaille catalog</a>
  (as reprinted in an appendix of Messier's Catalog) online.
<li><a href="../histlist/histlist.html">Historical Deep Sky Objects</a>:
  List of all 152 Deep Sky Object discovered before William Herschel began 
  his extensive survey in September, 1782, in various formats
<li><a href="dunlop.html">James Dunlop's Catalog</a> of southern Deep Sky Objects,
  compiled 1823-27.
<li><a href="bennett.html">The <i>Jack Bennett</i> Catalog</a> 
  of Southern Deep-Sky Objects (also available 
  <a href="bennett.txt">as plain ascii file</a>), which was contributed by 
  <a href="mailto:auke@aztec.co.za">Auke Slotegraaf</a>; thanks ! 
<li>The Saguaro Astronomy Club (SAC) has compiled a 
  <a href="sac110bn.html">list of the 110 best NGC objects</a> 
  not in Messier's catalog. Also note the
  <a href="/pub/info/newsletters/sacnews/html/sac.110.best.ngc.list.html">
  original list</a> by <i>A.J. Crayon</i> and <i>Steve Coe</i>; it is also
  available as inexpensive booklet 
  (<a href="/pub/info/newsletters/sacnews/html/sac.110.best.ngc.html">info</a>).
  This list was contributed by 
  <a href="http://www.primenet.com/~dickson/"><i>Paul Dickson</i></a>,
  editor of the 
  <a href="http://www.primenet.com/~dickson/sacnews.html">

  (also available as <a href="mm_plus.txt">ascii file</a>):
  <i>Wally Brown</i> and <i>Bob Buckner</i> have compiled a list of 110
  Deep Sky objects (75 Messiers, 34 NGCs, 1 Brocchi) suitable for a 
  1-night marathon session around September each year, the Messier Plus
  Marathon. Messier Plus marathons have been held first by the Saguaro
  Astronomy Club of Phoenix, Arizona, in <a href="../marathon/sac81p.txt">
  1981</a> and <a href="../marathon/sac82.txt">1982</a>, the list was

  Herschel 400 list of the AL, Burnham (all objects with long description),
  A. Dyer's <i>110 "Finest" NGC objects</i> (Observers Handbook 1996), and
  objects discussed in <i>Sky &amp; Telescope</i>. For more detail, read

  famous <a href="../../m-ref.html#webbsoc">Deep-Sky Observer's Handbook</a>
  Vol. 2, 3, and 4, has provided a numbered catalog of 700 deep-sky objects
  (nebulae, star clusters, and galaxies). This catalog <i>excludes</i> the
  bright <a href="../../more/virgo.html">Virgo Cluster</a> galaxies, which
  are treated in their Vol. 5 (Clusters of Galaxies).
<li>Ronald J. Morales has published <a href="../../m-ref.html#morales">
  <i>The Amateur Astronomer's Catalog of 500 Deep-Sky Objects</i></a>

  <i>Visual Astronomy of the Deep Sky</i>, contains an atlas of 90 and a 
  catalog of 611 deep sky objects visible for better equipped amateurs.
<li>Some historic observing lists, mostly from the 19th century, which may 
  still be suited as observing lists, include
  <ul>
  <li><a href="../../m-ref.html#smyth">Admiral William H. Smyth</a>, 
    <i>The Bedford Catalogue: From A Cycle of Celestial Objects</i>, 1844.
    We have <a href="smyth_c.html">a list of his 850 objects</a> online
    (besides deepsky objects, this contains stars and multiple stars)
  <li><a href="../../m-ref.html#webb">Rev. T.W. Webb</a>.
    <i>Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes</i>, 1859.
  </ul>
<li>Finally, some hardcore-observers may like to track down the whole 
  <b>NGC</b> and <b>IC</b> catalog by 
  <a href="dreyer.html">J.L.E. Dreyer</a>:
  <ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/">Bill Arnett</a> has provided a
    <a href="http://www.seds.org/billa/ngc.html">NGC Webpage</a> linking
    the more important NGC and IC web resources, including a dictionary
    for Dreyer's description code.
  <li><a href="http://www.seds.org/~spider/">The present author</a> 
    has provided an <a href="http://www.seds.org/~spider/ngc/ngc.html">
    interactive online NGC (and IC) catalog</a>, 
    based on Sky Publishing's famous NGC 2000.0 database.
  <li><a href="http://www.ngcic.com/">The NGC/IC Project</a> maintains an
    online database of various versions of the NGC and IC catalogs, 
    corrections to the catalogs, and observations of the NGC and IC 
    deepsky objects. You may contribute your observations to their 
    database, and generate your own observing list interactively from
    their facilities.
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>
Objects, especially those which are fainter and less suited for amateur 
observations, are often designated by catalog numbers from professional catalogs;
look at a <a href="../supp/cats.html">list of some common deep sky catalogs</a>.

If you know of further collections of Deep Sky objects suited for amateur 
observing (or "work-thru") please <a href="mailto:spider@seds.org">email me</a>.
