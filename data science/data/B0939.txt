              </font>Newcastle Building Society recognises three key groups of 
              people who have a stake in the future of the Society. These stakeholders

              most importantly you, our members and customers. Our commitment 
              to remaining a traditional building society provides us with a clear 
              vision as we enter the new millennium. We are confident that this 
              commitment will ensure that we can continue to meet your needs. 
            <p>Whether you are an investing member or a borrower, we do hope that 
              this will be the start of a long and happy relationship with us. 
              It is extremely important to us that you receive the level of service 
              you expect from one of the leading mutual building societies in

              </font>A building society is a mutual institution which is owned 
              by its members. Most customers of a building society are also members 
              of the society. Unlike a public limited company, such as a bank, 
              a mutual building society is not owned by third party equity shareholders. 
              This means that a mutual building society does not have any other 
              set of owners, separate from its customers, to influence or direct 
              its business.</p>
            <p>As the owners of the society, the members have certain</p>

      voting rights through which they can influence the affairs of the society. 
      <p><span class="hometitle">What rights do members have?</span><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><br>
        </font>Members have a range of rights. The most important of these are 
        described below. 
      <p><span class="hometitle">General Meetings</span><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><br>
        </font>Members are entitled to receive notice of, take part in and vote 
        at the Society's Annual General Meeting (AGM). The AGM must be held within 
        four months of the end of the Society's financial year. (For the majority 
        of societies with a financial year ending in December, the AGM would be 
        held in the following April.) The AGM is held to receive the annual accounts 
        and directors' report, to consider the auditors' report on the accounts, 
        to appoint the auditors and to elect the directors. Changes to the society's 
        rules or to its memorandum would often be considered at an AGM. Members 
        can ask questions and make comments - they may also ask for the agenda 
        to include a resolution to be discussed and voted on at the AGM, provided 
        they are qualified under the society's rules and have enough support from 
        other members. 
      <p>Occasionally a society will organise a Special General Meeting to discuss 
        a specific topic. Members can ask the society to organise such a meeting. 
        Normally at least 500 members who have been members for two years or more, 
        can require the board to hold such a meeting. The society may also require 
        that each member requesting the meeting pay a deposit of &pound;25.</p>
      <p><span class="hometitle">Voting</span><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><br>
        </font>Building societies operate on the principle of "one member, one 
        vote". This means that members have one vote each regardless of the size 
        of their savings or mortgage. If you are both a borrowing and saving member 
        with the society you will normally have just one vote.</p>
      <p>Members can vote on proposals put forward at general meetings. Members 
        unable to attend a meeting can appoint proxies to attend and vote on their 
        behalf; your society will tell you how to obtain a proxy form.</p>
      <p>Members can vote on any proposal changes to the memorandum and the rules 
        of the society. The memorandum describes those activities by which the 
        society governs its relationship with its members. They can be amended 
        only by a decision of the members at a general meeting</p>
      <p><span class="hometitle">Election of Directors</span><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><br>
        </font>Members elect the directors of the society. All directors must 
        be investing members of the society Typically, a society will have a board 
        of between 7 and 15 directors. The board takes the major decisions in 
        the running of the society (such as deciding on the overall levels of 
        interest rates, the products and services to be offered and the overall 
        business strategy) and also appoints the senior managers. Directors usually 
        serve three year terms; they may then stand for re-election. Your society 
        will let you know when directors are due to retire.</p>
      <p>Members can nominate candidates and stand for election as directors. 
        Directors' responsibilities are onerous and complex, and they must take 
        account of the interest of all the investing and borrowing members. Members 
        therefore need to consider carefully before deciding to stand for election 
        to the board or nominating a candidate. A member standing for election 
        can ask the society to circulate an election address to the members of 
        the society. A society will provide details of the duties of directors 
        and the nomination and election procedures to any member on request.</p>
      <p><span class="hometitle">Information</span><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><br>
        </font>Members are entitled to receive a range of information, including: 
        * a copy of the society's rules and memorandum (on request) * a copy of 
        the annual summary financial statements on the society's business (which 
        is sent to members before the AGM, and also when a new account is opened) 
        * a copy of the detailed annual report and accounts (on request) * notice 
        of the AGM Societies must also provide a range of financial business information 
        before asking members to vote on a merger proposal or on a proposal to 
        transfer the society's business to a company.</p>
      <p><span class="hometitle">Do members have rights?</span><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><br>
        </font>Savings members with less than &pound;100 in their account, borrowing 
        members with mortgages of less than &pound;100 and members under the age 
        of 18 have the right only to receive information on request - they cannot 
        vote, nominate directors, or speak at AGM's for example.</p>
      <p class="hometitle">Charitable Foundation</p>
      <p>The Newcastle Building Society wants to avoid disruption to its business 
        caused by speculators. As a result all new customers opening accounts 
        are required to agree to assign any windfall benefits to which they might 
        become entitled on a future conversion or take-over of the Society. The 
        assignment will be in favour of the Community Foundation, one of the leading 
        community foundations in the UK. The agreement will be for a period of 
        5 years.</p>
