with previous servlet and JSP experience, please see

Marty normally runs <A HREF="index.html">on-site training courses</A> 
at customer locations.
This is easier administratively, and is more cost effective for students
since no travel is required. However, due to demand from those who do not have 
enough students for an on-site course, Marty will be running a public
(open enrollment) servlet and JSP training course September 17-20, 2002.
The course will be held at the Herndon Virginia Knowledge Development Center near
Washington DC,
an excellent facility with separate computers for each
student, breakfast and lunch, and fast internet connections. For directions,
hotels in the area, and details on the facility, see
<A HREF="http://www.kdc-washington.com/site1info.htm">

The 4-day course is taught by 
<A HREF="#Short-Course-Instructor">Marty Hall</A>,
an experienced developer, award-winning
instructor, conference speaker on servlets and JSP (JavaOne 2000,
JavaOne 2001, JavaOne 2002, International Conference for Java Development,
Evolve 2000, SD West, Comdex), and author of 
<A HREF="http://www.corewebprogramming.com/">Core Web Programming</A>. 
<A HREF="http://www.coreservlets.com/">Core Servlets and
JavaServer Pages</A>, and
<A HREF="http://www.moreservlets.com/">More Servlets and
JavaServer Pages</A> from Sun Microsystems
Press. <I>Core Servlets and JavaServer Pages</I> is 
<B>the</B> most popular servlet and JSP book internationally,
with translations in Bulgarian, Chinese, Czech, French, 
German, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian and Spanish.
It was chosen by amazon.com as one of
the five best computer programming books of 2001 and was one of
the top ten best-selling computer-related books at Borders
stores and amazon.com in 2001.
<P>
The course costs $2195 per student and includes a course notebook,
a copy of Marty's book, continental breakfast, hot lunch, coffee,
snacks, fax service, and local and long-distance phone service. 
Compare this price to courses from Sun, Learning Tree, and GlobalKnowledge 
that cost around $2400 for the same length course with no meals, textbooks,
or phone/fax service. Besides, with those and most other 
training sources, you get an unknown instructor who
did not develop the course materials and often 
lacks significant real-world development experience.
<P>
The course consists of an approximately equal mixture of lecture 
and hands-on lab time and
assumes that all students <I>already</I> have at least basic 
Java programming skills (but not any
experience with server-side Java, CGI, or HTTP). 
Previous exposure to HTML is helpful but not absolutely required. 
<P>
<B>Space is limited: four previous offerings versions of the same course 
(Rockville, Maryland and Sydney, Australia) were full.</B> 
Students are enrolled on a first-come,
first-served basis. To register, fill out the
<A HREF="Course-Registration-Form.html">
course registration form</A> and mail it in with a check or
company purchase order number.

by far. The course was exactly what I was hoping for.

Compared to the other short courses I have taken this one completely          
redefined my scale from 1-10.

I'm not easily pleased by industry courses. Luckily, not all
presenters are as good as Marty, otherwise University lecturers
like myself would be out of work. <I>From 2000 Servlet and JSP
short course in Sydney Australia.</I>
<BR><BR>
Marty is a fantastic teacher and communicator. I thoroughly
enjoyed the course and it was timely for my current work.
<I>From 2000 Servlet and JSP short course in Sydney Australia.</I>
<BR><BR>
It was the best way to survey Java servlets and JSP. I enjoyed
every minute of Marty's interesting and knowledge-filled
presentations. 
<I>From 2000 Servlet and JSP short course in Rockville.</I>
<BR><BR>
Totally fantastic, right level, right material.
<I>From 2000 Servlet and JSP short course in Rockville.</I>
<BR><BR>
It was an awesome course delivered by an extraordinary man. Yes, I       
truly admire your in-depth knowledge, approach and ideas.
<I>From 2000 Servlet and JSP short course in Rockville.</I>
<BR><BR>
This was the most successful short course that I have taken      
in the past five years. ... A Great Feat. Keep it up!
<I>From 2000 Servlet and JSP short course in Rockville.</I>
<BR><BR>
Being a Microsoft Certified Instructor for seven years I 
definitely give a top point to Marty. Discussions are well controlled,
they were interesting yet weren't boring. Marty's knowledge is
incredible.
<I>From 2000 Servlet and JSP short course in Rockville.</I>
<BR><BR>
Definitely the <U>best</U> computer class I ever took... I do
not even know how you could have done a better job. <I>From
1999 Java short course for GM R&amp;D Center in Detroit.</I>
<BR><BR>
Masterful, quick-paced presentation. Witty, but never trite. Discussed
but never belabored. A Java ed-venture. A gaggle of Goslings could not
have done better! <I>Attendee at 1999 Java short course at
the U.S. Coast Guard Operations System Center in West Virginia,
waxing poetic on the course evaluation.</I>
<BR><BR>
Superb! ... Great amount of information, clearly communicated and very
good interaction with the audience. <I>From 1999 Java short course at
