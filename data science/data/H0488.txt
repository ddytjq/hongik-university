It is unclear what this means.  Shannon used the term "information"
in a precise

I will assume that the extra words
"complex specified" are jargon that can be dispensed with.
Indeed,
William A. Dembski

<!--
In the summer of 2000 he published an article in _Nucleic
Acids Research_ titled "Evolution of Biological Information."(3) In that
paper he identified a computational phase space consisting of all sequences
256 letters in length constructed from a four-letter alphabet (cf. the four
nucleotide bases).  The phase space therefore consisted of 4^256 sequences,
or approximately 10^154 sequences.
-->

<p>
<li>
<blockquote><font color = blue>
Starting with an evolutionary algorithm
acting on a randomly chosen sequence from the phase space, Schneider then
purported to generate an information-rich sequence corresponding to a finely
tuned genetic control system in which one part of the genome codes for
proteins that precisely bind to another part of the genome.
</blockquote></font>
It is more precise to say that the information was gained
by the <i>set</i> of binding sites.
Note the analysis in the paper that shows that the total
genomic uncertainty does not change much during the evolution.
</p>

<!--
To model genetic
control, Schneider divided his 256-letter computational genomes essentially
in half, treating the first half as what he called a "weight matrix" and the
second half as binding sites. The optimization task of his evolutionary
algorithm was to get the weight matrix to match up suitably with the binding
sites. Here the weight matrix corresponded to translation and protein folding
of natural biological systems, and the binding sites corresponded to
locations on DNA where these proteins would then bind. The details here are
not that important. What is important is the discrepancy between what
Schneider thinks his computer simulation establishes and what it in fact
establishes. 
-->

<a name = "phrase.for.free"></a>
<p>
<li>
<blockquote><font color = blue>
Schneider thinks that he has generated complex specified
information for free, or as he puts it, "from scratch."
</blockquote></font>
This statement represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the paper.
The phrase 'for free' does not appear in the paper.  The claim
in the
<a href =
"http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/paper/ev"
>ev paper</a>
is that the information appears under replication, mutation and selection,
commonly known as 'evolution'.  It is not for free!  Half of the population
DIES every generation!
In the standard example given in the paper,
to gain 4 bits required the (virtual) deaths of some 32 organisms x 704
generations = 22528 deaths.  On average that's 22528/4 = 5632 deaths
per bit.  Note that theoretically one could get 1 bit of information
with only 1 binary decision.  So the evolution is, not surprisingly,
a rather inefficient information generating mechanism.
No biologist has ever claimed any differently!
</p>
<p>
Note that "from scratch" does <i>not</i> mean the
same thing as "for free".
"From scratch" refers (obviously) to the
<i>initial condition of the genome</i> which is random in
this case so that Rsequence = 0 bits.  That is, there is no
<i>measurable</i>
information in the binding sites at the beginning of the simulation.
"For free" would mean "without effort", and the paragraph
above demonstrates that there is quite a bit of effort
and (virtual) pain for the gains observed.
</p>

<p>
<font color = "red">
NOTE ALSO
</font> that Dembski has attempted to
put words into my head.
I <strong>did not</strong> use the term
"complex specificed information" in my paper.
This is Dembski's jargon, unique to him.
No scientist or engineer uses it.
Furthermore, the statement implies that I made the information.
That's wrong, it was generated by the process of the program.
A careful scholor would avoid incorrect attributions.
</p>

<!--
Early in his article
he writes, "The necessary information should be able to evolve from
scratch."(4) Later in the article he claims to have established precisely
that: "The program simulates the process of evolution of new binding sites
from scratch."(5) According to Schneider the advantage of his simulation over
other simulations that attempt to generate complex specified information
(like Richard Dawkins's biomorphs program and Thomas Ray's Tierra
environment) is that Schneider's program "starts with a completely random
genome, and no further intervention is required."(6) Schneider gives his
readers to believe that he has decisively confirmed the full sufficiency of
the Darwinian mechanism to account for biological information. Accordingly,
he claims his model "addresses the question of how life gains information,
...  [and] shows explicitly how this information gain comes about from
mutation and selection, without any other external influence."(7) But has
Schneider in fact successfully answered the charge that the Darwinian
mechanism is inadequate to generate biological information and in particular
complex specified information? In reading Schneider's article, and more
generally when confronting Darwinian scenarios that purport to generate
complex specified information for free, I always go back to my days as a
graduate student in mathematics teaching undergraduates trigonometry. When it
came time to grade their tests, I always had to watch that they didn't trick
me by purporting to establish a trigonometric equality when in fact they
didn't have a clue why one trigonometric expression was equal to another.
What students would do is write one expression at the top of the page, the
other at the bottom of the page. Then they would manipulate the top
expression, transforming it line by line down the middle of the page. Next
they would manipulate the bottom expression, transforming it line by line up
the middle of the page. In the middle of the page the transformed top and
bottom expressions would happily meet, offering no clue how they were
related. My challenge was to find where the unwarranted leap occurred (i.e.,
where the transformation from one expression to the other could no longer be
justified). I find myself in a similar position analyzing Schneider's article
and Darwinian scenarios like his.

<a name ="Wolpert.Macready"></a>
<p>
<li>
<blockquote><font color = blue>
Schneider claims to have generated complex
specified information for free. The No Free Lunch theorems, however, tell us
this is not possible.
</blockquote></font>
What <i>scientific journal</i> has published these theorems?
Until they have been peer reviewed and published, they are empty claims.
If they are <i>theorems</i> then the proof will be compelling
and publication should be easy.
Of course, mere publication would not prove that they are correct.
Given the results of my program, I would venture that the proofs of these
theorems are likely to contain flaws.
<font color = blue>2001 June 7</font>.
Up to this point I was responding based on a strong claim
which carried no proper citations.
In an email to me today,
Wesley R. Elsberry point out that
these theorems were found by Wolpert
and Macready at the Santa Fe Institute.
<a href =
"http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/wolpert96no.html"
>http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/wolpert96no.html</a>
gives links to the papers.
Elsberry explained that
the theorems are about how well algorithms do relative
to one another, not about whether an algorithm works.
Therefore Dembski's statement is a misdirection,
and is not relevant to the problem.
</p>

<p>
<li>
<blockquote><font color = blue>
Where, then, has he smuggled in complex specified
information? The precise place where he smuggles it in is not hard to find if
one knows what to look for. Here is the crucial paragraph in his article:
"The organisms [i.e., the computational sequences in phase space] are
subjected to rounds of selection and mutation.  First, the number of mistakes
made by each organism in the population is determined. Then the half of the
population making the least mistakes is allowed to replicate by having their
genomes replace ('kill') the ones making more mistakes.  (To preserve
diversity, no replacement takes place if they are equal.) At every
generation, each organism is subjected to one random point mutation in which
the original base is obtained one-quarter of the time."(8) Within this
crucial paragraph, the crucial sentence is: "The number of mistakes made by
each organism in the population is determined." Who or what determines the
number of mistakes? Clearly, Schneider had to program any such determination
of number of mistakes into his simulation.
</blockquote></font>
This is not unreasonable
<i>because it happens the same way in nature</i>.
For example, if a bacterium has severe mutations in 5 ribosome binding sites,
then that means that 5 proteins will not be made.  Is this fatal?  Not necessarily.
Suppose that the 5 proteins code for processing 5 different sugars.  If the
sugars are not in the medium that the bacterium swims in then it will make no
difference.  But when the bacterium comes to a solution where one of the
sugars is available, it will be unable to eat.  If that is the sole carbon
source, it will starve (surely a 'mistake'!) and bacteria that have mutations
that correct a site or already have a correct site will survive. 
A simple way to account for this is to count the number of mistakes.
It may be that a highly beaten up genome (with 100 mistakes) is pretty much
as badly off as one with only a few mutations, so maybe one should take
the logarithm of the number of mistakes.  But a logarithm is a monotonic
function of its argument, so this will not change the selection order
and therefore would not affect the evolution (other than wasting computer cycles).
Surely it is not reasonable to say that a creature with 5 mistakes will survive
better than one with 2 so
<i>to match the natural situation</i>
we should pick a monotonic function.
That's what I did in the paper.
</p>
<p>
So the answer to "Who or what determines the number of mistakes?" 
is: Just as in nature, the number of genetic control systems that
<i>if controlled</i> would give an advantage determines the number
of mistakes.
</p>
<p>
In the ev program
the number of binding sites is determined by the user,
but this is irrelevant since it is a free parameter---<i>i.e.</i> the user
may explore any value---and similar
results are obtained with various numbers of binding sites.
In nature
the number of required binding sites is determined by the
history and
current physiology of a organism.
This was discussed in both
<a href =
"http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/paper/ev"
>ev</a>
and
<a href =
"http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/paper/schneider1986"
>schneider1986</a>.
</p>
<p>
In addition this, Wesley R. Elsberry points out that
the environment is important.
Specifically, the environment determines the 
opportunities for physiology.
For example,
if a bacterium is frequently in an environment that has a sugar
that it cannot metabolize, then duplication of the metabolic
genes from a similar sugar and drift of the protein recognition
will lead to the introduction of another ribosome binding site and
associated control systems.
</p>

<a name = "no.fitness"></a>
<p>
<li>
<blockquote><font color = blue>
Moreover, the determination of
number of mistakes is the key defining feature of his fitness function, for
which optimal fitness corresponds to minimal number of mistakes.
</blockquote></font>
I generally do not find 'fitness' to be a useful concept.
In the ev program there is no fitness function
and the word 'fitness' does not appear in the paper.
Unlike most biologists
I dispense with the concept of a fixed 'fitness function'.
A 'fitness landscape' is too rigid
since it does not
describe the effects the organism itself may have
and it does not account for a changing environment
(In addition, fitness is
generally depicted as 2 dimensional,
which causes severe conceptual problems, see
<a href =
"http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/paper/ccmm"
target = reference
>ccmm</a>).
At best there is only 'relative instantaneous fitness'
in a changing environment.
That is, whoever makes the fewest mistakes in the current
environment is likely to survive.
</p>

<!--
Readers of
Richard Dawkins's _The Blind Watchmaker_ have seen all this before, to wit,
in Richard Dawkins's METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL simulation. To be sure,
Schneider's simulation is more subtle. But the parallels are unmistakable.
Like Dawkins's simulation, Schneider's simulation starts with a randomly
given "genome" and requires no further intervention.  Unlike Dawkins's
simulation, Schneider's does not identify an explicitly given target
sequence. Even so, it identifies target sequences implicitly through the
choice of fitness function. Moreover, by tying fitness to number of mistakes,
Schneider guarantees that the gradients of his fitness function rise
gradually and thus that his evolutionary algorithm converges in short order
to an optimal computational sequence (optimality being defined in relation to
his fitness function). Although once the algorithm starts running there is no
intervention on the part of the investigator, it is not the case that
Schneider didn't intervene crucially in structuring the fitness function. He
did, and this is where he smuggled in the complex specified information that
he claimed to obtain from scratch.
-->

<p>
<li>
<blockquote><font color = blue>
Schneider's choice of fitness function is
the most obvious place where he smuggles in complex specified information.
</blockquote></font>
Counting of the number of mistakes matches what happens in nature,
as described above.
I only claim that the ev simulation matches what happens in nature in
essential points.
No smuggling occurs.
If Dembski finds that this produces information,
then he will understand that the simulation shows that
<i>
information can be generated
in nature solely by replication, mutation and selection</i>.
That is
<i>
information as mathematically defined by Claude Shannon can be generated
by Darwinian evolution</i>.
</p>

<p>
<li>
<blockquote><font color = blue>
But there are others. In the _Nucleic Acids Research_ article we've been
discussing, he does not list the source code for the program underlying his
simulation. For that code he refers readers to the relevant web address. The
source code is revealing and shows that Schneider had to do a lot of
fine-tuning to his evolutionary algorithm to make his simulation come out
right.
</blockquote></font>
That is quite incorrect.
After finishing the writing of my thesis in the spring of 1984
(see
<a href =
"http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/paper/schneider1986"
>Schneider1986</a>)
I had a spare week before my thesis defense.
I had already determined how to write the evolution program, and I decided
to do it as a test of my thesis.  I wrote the program in the space
of 2 or 3 days.  I did not fine-tuning it
and yet it gave the result that Rsequence
approached Rfrequency.
(Tweeking it to work would have invalidated my goal,
which was to test my thesis!)
At the end of the week I walked into my thesis
defense <i>knowing</i> that I could simulate my main thesis using a computer!
In any case, I never mentioned that during the defense ...
If Dembski will look more closely at the code he will see that it is
constructed quite cleanly with lots of documentation (55% of the code
characters in
<a href =
"http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/delila/ev.html"
>ev</a>
are
<a href =
"http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/delila/codecomments.html"
>in comments</a>).
The main loop is:
<pre>
   for c := 1 to e.cycles do begin
      culture(list,e);
      if (c mod e.storagefrequency) = 0 then putout(e, all);
   end;
</pre>
where
'e' is a compund variable that contains all other variables
("everything")
and
putout just saves the current state every once in a while.
The culture routine is:
<pre>
   e.generation := e.generation + 1;
   reproduce(e);
   mutate(e);
   order(list, e)
</pre>
Note that:
<ul>
<li> 'reproduce' replicates the organisms with fewer
mistakes into the places of the ones with more mistakes
<font color = red> and does nothing else</font>.
<li> 'mutate' makes changes randomly over the genome
<font color = red>
without regard to where the hits are</font>
and
<font color = red>
it does nothing else</font>.
<li> 'order'
translates the weight matrix and scans the genome
of each organism
to determine the number of mistakes.
It then
sorts the organisms by their number of mistakes,
<font color = red> and does nothing else</font> besides
data recording into the list file.
</ul>
There is no place to fit in special 'fine-tuning'!
</p>

<p>
<li>
<blockquote><font color = blue>
For instance, in the crucial paragraph from his article that I quoted
above, Schneider remarks parenthetically: "To preserve diversity [of
organisms], no replacement takes place if [the number of mistakes is] equal."
Schneider's Pascal source code reveals why: "SPECIAL RULE: if the bugs have
the same number of mistakes, reproduction (by replacement) does not take
place.  This ensures that the quicksort algorithm does not affect who takes
over the population. [1988 October 26] Without this, the population quickly
is taken over and evolution is extremely slow!"(9) Schneider is here
fine-tuning his evolutionary algorithm to obtain the results he wants. All
such fine-tuning amounts to investigator interference smuggling in complex
specified information.
</blockquote></font>
This is a testable claim, and the test and results are given
<a href =
"http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/paper/ev/dembski/claimtest.html"
>on another page</a>.
The results show clearly that
removing the SPECAL RULE has no effect
on the gain of information by evolution
so
<font color = red>
William A. Dembski's claim is incorrect.

<p>
In
Section 4.9, "Following the Information Trial",
on pages 212-218,
Dembski attempts to deal not only with
the Ev program, but also with my rebuttal
on this page.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
<font color = "red">
<strong>
Dembski Responded to This Rebuttal
</strong>
(which you can read starting at the
<a href =
"#page_top"
>top of this page</a>)
by quoting parts of it,
(on the bottom of page 214 he
<a href =
"#phrase.for.free"
>quotes from this page</a>)
so he
had an opportunity before the book went to press
to correct any mistakes, to resolve any misunderstandings
and to admit any errors.
Much of the phrasing in the book is identical to his original statements.
Finally, the rebuttal
was started on
2001 June 7
and substantially finished on June 8, while the
claim test was written
2001 June 6 and June 7th.
Dembski's recorded access to the web page in No Free Lunch
(see page 235
item 71) was "10 June 2001", so HE HAD ACCESS.
</font>
</p>

<li>
<p>
<strong>Dembski Misunderstood the No Free Lunch Theorems</strong>.
<a href =
"#Wolpert.Macready"
>As noted above</a> Dembski misunderstood
the No Free Lunch theorems.
Surprisingly, he has not corrected himself.
(But then, the entire book would
probably evaporate, so he couldn't
do <i>that</i> could he?)
On page 212 he says:
<font color = blue>
"The No Free Lunch theorems
show that evolutionary algorithms,
apart from careful fine-tuning
by a programmer, are no better than blind
search and thus no better than
pure chance."
</font>
This is clearly wrong,
given the results of the Ev program,
since those would have take much longer to
give results if it were merely randomizing
without selection.
Furthermore, the results would not have been stable
(the information curve goes up and stays there).
When one uses a theorem, one must understand
it correctly and one must apply it correctly.
If one does not do this, everything that follows
may be nonsense.
Apparently, by <a href =
"http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/quotes.html"
>Dudley's Criteria</a>
Dembski falls below level 4.
</p>

<a name = "CSI">
<li>
<p>
<strong>CSI is ill defined</strong>.
Page 215: <font color = blue>
"The issue is whether in the currency of information,
and CSI in particular, Darwinian evolution
incurs a cost."
</font>
CSI is not used by anyone except Dembski
and as far as I know is undefined.
A precise definition is needed before Dembski
can claim <i>anything</i>.
I will assume that he means Shannon
information as defined in my paper.
There is no reason to add extra notation,
so saying that the information is
"complex specified" does not add anything.
I have not had a chance to read
all of "No Free Lunch",
but
to be taken seriously, Dembski must do one of the following:
<ul>
<li> Publically abandon the term "Complex
Specified Information".
<br> <strong>OR</strong>
<li> Publish a <i>precise
definition</i> along with a <strong>clear</strong>
explanation of how CSI differs from
standard measures already in the literature.
Such a definition would show exactly how
to compute CSI given (for example)
DNA sequences of
protein binding sites.
</ul>
If he does not do one of these things,
I see no reason why anyone should
not dismiss his works out-of-hand
from now on.
I think that he should abandon "CSI".

2002 March 9:

>Dissecting Dembski's "Complex Specified Information"</a>.
</p>

<li>
<p>
<strong>Dembski Makes Incorrect Statements
About Other People's Positions</strong>.
Continuing on
page 215: <font color = blue>
"It does not, and Schneider agrees that it does not."
</font>
Dembski put words into my mouth.
(This is a common <i>creationist</i> tactic.)
There is an extreme cost to gain the information
in living things - the death of thousands of organisms.
In other words, selection is highly costly.
BUT at the same time, selection is the process
by which the remaining organisms have more information
than the starting population.
I stated this clearly
<a href =
"#phrase.for.free"
>higher up on this page</a> but instead of dealing
with it, Dembski dismissed it as "semantic hair-splitting".
</p>

<a name = "tautology"></a>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Dembski's Tautology Objection Fails</strong>.
Page 216:
Dembski points out my statement
(<a href = "#no.fitness"
>from higher up on this page</a>)
that
<font color = green>
"At best there is only 'relative instantaneous fitness'
in a changing environment.
That is, whoever makes the fewest mistakes in the current
environment is likely to survive."
</font>
He then claims that
<font color = blue>
"This last statment is a tautology.
It says that the survivors are the fittest
(according to some apparently inexpressible
notion of "relative fitness")
and that the fittest are the survivors."
</font>
First, it is not inexpressible.  It is clear that in the
Ev program an organism from late in the evolution
would invariably win if placed into an early population.
So what counts is who makes more mistakes (a relative
comparison), not an absolute number of mistakes.
I am willing to accept a concept of fitness, as stated
above, which is changing over time.
The point is that fitness is not a simple function
of the environment because the organism changes
the environment.  So hill climbing on a fixed landscape
is not a good model of what happens in nature.
The interpretation that there is a tautology is wrong.
First, there is no 'fittest', only a number of mistakes
made by an organism <i>in the program</i>.
This is simple to compute and the program does that.
In the program
FIRST
the number of mistakes
each organism
is determined.
THEN they are compared in a separate step.
The ones that survive are those with the fewest mistakes.
In the <a href =
"ftp://ftp.ncifcrf.gov/pub/delila/ev.p"
>code of the program</a>
is a procedure called 'order'.  It contains:
<blockquote>
<pre>
procedure order(var list: text; var e: everything);
(* order the bugs: evaluate, sort and display *)
var
   bug: position; (* index to the rank array *)
begin
   if e.selecting
   then for bug := 1 to e.p.bugs do evaluate(e,bug)
   else for bug := 1 to e.p.bugs do randomize(e,bug);
   quicksort(1,e.p.bugs);
   if (e.generation mod e.displayinterval = 0)
   then display(list, e);
end;
(* end module ev.order version<!-- --> = 2.50; (@ of ev 1988 oct 6 *)
<!-- the html comment above blocks the ver program from finding the wrong
version number so I can make backups.  Neither of these comments
are in the original code, as you can readily verify. -->
</pre>
</blockquote>
Thus if there is selecting, then the bugs are evaluated.
This is <i>followed</i> by a call to quicksort to
sort them by the number of mistakes.
(The actual killing is done in procedure reproduce,
where the bugs in the first half are duplicated
and copied into the 'stalls' of the bugs in the second half.
Of course,
this is only a selection if the bugs were sorted by
their mistakes.)
<strong>
There are two distinct
steps and there is no tautology.
</strong>
Note that the first step can be a <i>random</i>
evaluation if the user chooses to turn selection off.
This objection is merely a diversion by Dembski who is
evidently grasping at straws (and making straw men!)
to avoid concluding that the program really
does evolve binding sites exactly in parallel with
what happens in nature.

<strong>Environment makes selections</strong>.
Page 216:
Dembski asks who or what counts the mistakes.
The answer is simple: the environment
in interaction with the organism.
For example, in front of an open
reading frame there must be a ribosome
binding site or the open reading
frame will not be made into a protein.
This was clearly stated in the
<a href =
"http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/paper/ev"
>original Ev paper</a>.
Apparently
Dembski does not understand the meaning of
<a href =
"http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/glossary.html#Rfrequency"
target = "glossary"
><i>R<sub>frequency</sub></i></a>.
Briefly, there are a certain number
of genes which,
if under appropriate control,
would give a selective advantage
to an organism.  This number is
approxmiately
fixed by history
and current genetics.
If an organism has the controls,
it will do better than one that
does not have controls.
The latter is more <i>likely</i> to die.
This probabilistic situation occurs
in the ev program.
So the answer is that 'the environment'
counts the mistakes.
For example,
<ul>
<li><a href = "#CSI">if a researcher
invents new terminology without
giving reasonable arguments for it</a>,
<li>makes blatant mistakes in his arguments,
<li>if he does not correct errors when
they are pointed out to him,
<li>and especially
<a href = "#incredibly"
>if he avoids dealing with tests of his claims</a>,
</ul>
then in the long run he will be
dismissed by the majority of scientists.
The environment makes the selection.

<strong>Two Parts</strong>.

"The second part of Schneider's response
is therefore to admit that
the counting of mistakes does occur
after all ...
</font>
This is a very curious statement,
given that the initial idea in the
Ev program was to count mistakes!
Dembski has created a "strawman" image of my
arguments and then proceeds to (attempt)
to knock them down.  Again,
<font color = red>
the only
way this will succeed is that readers
who have not taken time to
read my original paper will be fooled.
</font>
Using the ignorance of the reader is
a typical <i>creationist</i> ploy.
The 'two part' argument that
Dembski complains about
only reflects his own misunderstanding.

Page 217:

"Yet if the counting of mistakes
matches what happens in nature in essential
points,
the the obvious conclusion is that
nature is chock-full of design
and that replication, mutation,
and selection are merely instruments
for expressing that design."
</font>
This is another misunderstanding by Dembski.
(They come so fast and thick here
that I am only pointing out the highlights.
The reader can find plenty more!)
The three processes
of replication, mutation,
and selection are not expressing
'design' in nature.
A cliff is not a 'design' in the sense
of being formed by an intelligent being
(as Dembski would have us think)
it forms by well understood geological
processes.
Yet the cliff will select against animals
that cannot see and for those with
better eyesight.
It is more accurate to say that
the evolutionary processes reflect
the environment.

<strong>Dembski shifts arguments!</strong>
On page 217 of the book we find:
<font color = blue>
"Schneider's choice of error-counting
function is the most obvious place
where he smuggles in CSI."
</font>
The history was that Dembski
did
<font color = red>
<i>not</i>
</font>
present this "obvious" argument first.
His first argument was about the SPECIAL RULE!
Go back to

and you will find a different sentence:
<font color = blue>
"Schneider's choice of fitness function is the most obvious place where he
smuggles in complex specified information.
But there are others. "
</font>
In other words, after finding that he was in hot water
because of
<a href =
"http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/paper/ev/dembski/claimtest.html"
>my test of his claim</a>,
he avoided the issue and brought up another (weak) issue!
Dembski did not present the history accurately.

Dembski failed to respond to

>my test of his claim</a>,
the results of which completely demolished his argument!
On page 217 of the book he ran the same argument.
Perhaps he didn't have time to get it into the book?
I initiated this web page on 2001 June 6.
The book just came out and the publication date was November 2001.
Was there enough time?
Yes.
Dembski <i>quoted</i> other items on
this web page, so he had full access to the arguments.
There is no reason to avoid the critical issue.
Dembski avoided discussing a careful study which showed that 
his arguments are false.
<font color = red>
This tactic will only work if the reader is
unaware that Dembski is avoiding arguments that demolish his position.

I completed reading No Free Lunch.
Dembski attempts to define complex specified information.
His arguments are messy (repeatedly varying from silly examples
to overdone math) but the essentials seem clear enough to
deal with.  I therefore asked whether the Ev program creates
CSI and was led to conclude that it does.
(This in no way implies that I condone CSI.  I think
it is a mistake and that Shannon was a master to avoid 
this mistake.)
The logic is given on
