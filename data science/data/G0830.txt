FIRAS Scientific Results</h1>

<hr>The images shown below depict data taken with the Far Infrared Absolute
Spectrophotometer (FIRAS) instrument aboard NASA's Cosmic Background Explorer
(COBE). The colors generally do not map linearly into sky brightness. Use
the
<a href="firas_products.html">FIRAS data products</a> for quantitative
analysis. Additional images are available in the <a href="slide_captions.html">COBE
Slide Set</a>.

plotted in waves per centimeter vs. intensity. The solid curve shows the
expected intensity from a single temperature blackbody spectrum, as predicted
by the hot Big Bang theory. A blackbody is a hypothetical body that absorbs
all electromagnetic radiation falling on it and reflects none whatsoever.
The FIRAS data were taken at 34 positions equally spaced along this curve.
The FIRAS data match the curve so exactly, with error uncertainties less
than the width of the blackbody curve, that it is impossible to distinguish
the data from the theoretical curve. These precise CMB measurements show
that 99.97% of the radiant energy of the Universe was released within the
first year after the Big Bang itself. All theories that attempt to explain
the origin of large scale structure seen in the Universe today must now
conform to the constraints imposed by these measurements. The results show
that the radiation matches the predictions of the hot Big Bang theory to
an extraordinary degree. See

<p>In addition to its primary, cosmological objective, the FIRAS provided
important new information about the interstellar medium. The far-infrared
continuum is formed by thermal emission from interstellar dust, while spectral
lines are emitted by interstellar gas. Nine emission lines were detected
in the FIRAS spectra: the 158 &micro;m ground state transition of C+; the
N+ 122 &micro;m and 205 &micro;m transitions; the 370 &micro;m and 609
&micro;m lines of neutral carbon; and the CO J=2-1, 3-2, 4-3, and 5-4 lines.

The maps are projections of the full sky in Galactic coordinates. The plane
of the Milky Way is horizontal in the middle of the map with the Galactic
center at the center. The C+ line (<i>top</i>) is an important coolant
of the interstellar gas, in particular the "Cold Neutral Medium" (<i>e.g.,</i>
surfaces of star-forming molecular clouds). In contrast, the N+ line emission
(<i>bottom</i>) arises entirely from the "Warm Ionized Medium" which surrounds
hot stars.
