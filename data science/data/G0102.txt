There is a more mathematical explanation, but I figured that not everyone
would want to wade through the <a href="schwarzschild.html">the full
explanation</a>, even though the equations are not that difficult upon
examination.
<p>
<h1>Black holes by supernova</h1>
Firstly, a black hole isn't really a hole at all, but that's the easiest
way to think of its effects on the rest of the universe. Take a star
that's at least thirty times larger than our sun and make it explode
(called a supernova).  Stars do that at the end of their lifetime,
sometimes leaving a remnant of the violent explosion.  The nature of the
remnant depends on its mass.  If the remnant is less than 1.4 solar
masses, it will become a white dwarf, a kind of hot dead star that isn't
bright enough to visibly shine.  If the remnant is roughly 1.4 solar
masses, it will collapse. The protons and electrons will be squished
together, and their elementary quarky particles will recombine to form
neutrons. What you would get is small (by stellar terms) sphere of
neutrons with perhaps a thin film of electrons and other stuff at its
surface. That's why it's called a neutron star. See, the neutrons don't
mind hanging around near each other; but if you get them close enough to
each other, they get anxious and resist being pushed any closer. (Yes, I'm
attributing <i>emotions</i> to <i>sub-atomic particles</i>.) The neutrons
of a neutron star are, indeed, pressed quite close to one another and
exert a certain pressure on each other. This pressure prevents the further
collapse of the neutrons star. If the remnant is larger than 3 solar
masses, it becomes a black hole (well, 2 or 3 depending on who's giving
you the number).  I think that calculates out to a star roughly 30 solar
masses before supernova.
<p>

align="right" width="188" height="191" border=1></a>For example, let's
pick Eta
Carin&#230, a superstar
that is hundreds of times larger than the sun (also 8,000 ly away) and
happened to have exploded around 1850ad.<sup><a 
href="breferences.html#carinae">2</a></sup>  That and I have a nice
current picture of it.  Very well, Eta Carin&#230 goes supernova!
In a supernova the atmosphere of a star collapses onto and compresses its
core, and the remaining mix of stuff is blown into space leaving a remnant
of the core.  During the earlier part of the star's life, it fused
hydrogen into helium. During the later part of its life, it fused helium
into the heavier elements, which made their way to the core of the star.
In the last split second of its life, as waves of energy push out from the
collapsing core, the star fuses its atmosphere of helium (and a few other
things) with its core of iron.  This is called nucleosynthesis.  This
process created ALL the atoms heavier than iron in this universe.  These
heavier atoms plus millions of neutrinos are thrown out in waves as the
star collapses, leaving the remnant.
<p>
Now, since Eta Carin&#230's remnant is larger than three solar masses, the
pressure of collapse and the force of gravity of all that mass squishing
the core (which is very hot metal) condenses all the matter together. No
more electron shells and orbits --- the neutrons are forced together.
Then, the very neutrons themselves give up and get squished by the
pressure, and the star keeps on collapsing.  See, there's this certain
radius that determines whether the star can squish itself into a black
hole.  It's called the Schwarzschild Radius (swar - shild).  If the
starstuff can collapse itself smaller than R<sub>s</sub> (the Radius),
stand up and cheer, for it has become a black hole.
<p>
<h1>What does it look like as the star collapses?</h1>
If you were to watch Eta Carin&#230 becoming a black hole, you would first
see the dramatic and wonderful supernova, in which the superstar
forcefully ejects most of its atmosphere very quickly.  It's a violent
process but quite pretty.  After enjoying this for a while, you would see
the star itself start to collapse.  After watching this for a while, you
would think it mighty peculiar that the star <i>seems</i> to be slowing
down and getting redder and dimmer as it collapses.  What's all this?!
These are the effects of the gravitational field getting stronger.  Okay,
a brief side-note about gravity and light cones.
<p>
<a name="cone"><h1>Light cones --- get yer light cones right 'ere!</h1>
In the presence of a gravitational field time slows down.  You don't sit
there and wonder why your watch is running slower.  <i>Everything</i>
slows down --- your watch, your brain, your cells, your very
atoms --- everything.  Someone who is outside the field would watch you
and wonder why you're moving so slowly (and you would wonder why they're
moving so quickly). This effect is called <a  
href="twins.html#dialation">time dialation</a>.
<p>
You've probably heard many times how the speed of light is a constant in a
vacuum.  Suppose you have a light ray in a gravitational field (hey,
happens every day!).  It can't slow down like your watch and your brain
and your cells and your atoms because it's light in a vacuum and it must
go a constant speed. So, does it just keep going regardless of gravity?
No way!  The speed of the light ray can't decrease, but the frequency can.
Oh, tricked you with that frequency bit, hunh? Light is formally known as
electromagnetic radiation (I shall only type that once, here, for it is a 
long word and I'm liable to mis-spell it). What that means is that light
is really a changing electric field (which induces a changing magnetic
field, which induces a changing electric field, blah, blah).
<p>
The important part is that light can be thought of as a wave in some
respects, just like a wave in the ocean. Just like water waves, light rays
have a frequency of arrival and a wavelength (one being the reciprocal of
the other). The longer the wavelength is, the fewer waves can come in
during a certain time, thus the lower the frequency. Got it? If a yellow
light ray passes through a very strong gravitational field, its frequency
will lower and it will appear reddish.  Fine, fine, fine.  That explains
the color shift, but what about the slowing down bit?  A very useful
concept for explaining this is the light cone.  Imagine that all the
possible paths for light to take can be summed up in this cone shape. Why?
Uhhh ... it comes from a three dimensional interpretation of the two light
rays from a <a href="spacetime.html">spacetime diagram</a>. Just ... go
with it. If you were on a planet, that cone would describe what
directions the light would have to shine in order to escape from the
planet's gravitational field. Normally, light can escape from planets and
stars. They shine, y'see!
<p>
However, it all depends on the strength of gravity. Imagine the light rays
being emitted from poor ol' doomed Eta Carin&#230. As the star collapses
and approaches its R<sub>s</sub>, the gravitational
field gets stronger because there is more matter in a smaller place.
Certain light rays (such as those shot out in a tangent to the star) will
fall back down on the star because the gravity is <i>so strong</i>.  The
light cone becomes narrower.  When the star is very close to
R<sub>s</sub>, the light cone is quite narrow, and only those light rays
that travel out almost perpendicular to the star's surface will escape the
gravitational field.  When Eta Carin&#230 reaches R<sub>s</sub>, the light
cone closes, the event horizon forms, and light can no longer escape.
<p>
Back to what Eta Carin&#230 looks like as it collapses.
<p>
The star will continue shrinking, but as it neared R<sub>s</sub> it will
be so dim that you would probably need an infrared detector to see it.
Really close to R<sub>s</sub> for all intents and purposes Eta Carin&#230
has become a black hole.  I've heard different sources give different
times for this process.  Some say it takes forever for the last photon to
escape.  Some say that it will take a quite a short time.  It's all quite
iffy, since we've never actually seen it happen.  True that there might
still be photons coming at you that escaped before the event horizon
formed and are taking their sweet time about getting away.
<p>
<h1>Does the black hole just stay that size forever?</h1>
No way!  The black hole has a certain mass and size of its event horizon
when it forms, but that changes over time.  If stuff falls into the black
hole like dust and light, its mass increases.  If its mass increases, its
R<sub>s</sub> gets a little larger.  Therefore, if stuff falls in, the
event horizon gets a bigger.  The idea that black holes could only get
larger feels weird to me, so I'm quite happy to say that there is also a
reverse process, where the black hole gets smaller.  It has to do with <a
href="outside.html#hawking">Hawking radiation</a>. In short it is possible
for particles to form by stealing energy from the black hole.  If the
black hole loses energy (and energy = (mass)c<sup>2</sup>!), it gets
smaller.  Black holes are rather dynamic in that sense; you can always add
charge to them, take charge away, make them rotate slower, and change
their size.

BTW, if the sun were to suddenly pop into a black hole (no, it can't
actually ever be a black hole, but just imagine), would the earth go
plummeting into it? No, it would continue on its orbit and things would
get rather chilly, that's all. The black hole exerts the same
gravitational force on stuff around it as a star with the same mass would.
Things just get interesting close to the black hole.
<p>
Don't believe me? How about this argument. When calculating forces of
gravity from objects on other objects, we talk about the radius between
the two of them. Does this mean the radius from the surface of the one
object to the surface of the other? No. We talk about the radius between
the two centers of mass, and, when considering stars and planets, that
center is just the center of a sphere. Why? Well, consider yourself
sitting in your chair. Right now, every darned atom in the whole earth is
attracted to you (and you to each of them by Newton's Third Law, action
and reaction). Now, each bit of the earth attracts you with a certain
force and has a corresponding bit on your other side that attracts you
with an equal force. Well, the force is actually to the side and slightly
down, since you're standing on a curved surface. The side-to-side force 
cancels out and all you feel is the downward force, the force that points
directly at the center of the earth.
<p>
And what does this have to do with the sun-turned-black-hole not yanking
the earth out of orbit? I've proven to you that you can treat the force of
gravity as just a force from the center of an object. The center of an
object is just a point, it doesn't really exist. But as far as the
force of gravity is concerned, it only "sees" mass and radius. Right now,
for the case of you sitting on your chair, our calculation of the force of
gravity does not care if the object doing the attraction to you has its
mass spread out the size of the earth or whether it is concentrated in a
theoretical point. We only need your mass, the mass of the earth, and the
radius that separates you two.
<p>
That was lengthy! My apologies.
<p>
<h1>Black holes by coincidence</h1>
A black hole forming without a tell-tale and quite noticeable supernova to
warn the neighbors --- quite a frightening concept, isn't it?  It is
true, though.  The definition of a black hole is just an object that has
no matter  when you check up to its R<sub>s</sub>.  Compress something to
its Schwarzschild Radius and an event horizon forms around it.  Oh, you
don't belive me?  Okay, take the milky way.  At the core of our galaxy is
a bunch of old, massive stars.  Let us say a couple of these stars happen
to wander too close to one another.  *Pwoof*  Event horizon.
<p>
One of the many quirks of black holes (er, things with event horizons) is
that, as you consider larger black holes, the actual density of the
material needed to form said black hole decreases.  For a black hole with
a mass of 2.02 x 10<sup>26</sup> kilograms, it would have an R<sub>s</sub>
of 8.98 x 10<sup>7</sup> meters, and it would be about as dense as water!
Of course, the whole problem is in getting that much water in one
place ... then again, there was that report of water forming in the nebula
in Orion's belt.  Hmmm ...
<p>
<h1>Primordial black holes</h1>
Only modern black holes need to have remnant mass greater than three solar
masses to form. Way back when, according to astrophysicists, the universe
was much hotter and denser than it is now.  Due to this incredible
pressure, primordial black holes could form that were smaller than three
solar masses. Since they were so small, though,
most of them would have <a href="outside.html">evaporated</a> by now. 
Those primordial black holes large enough to survive up until now
would have the mass of an asteroid (10<sup>12</sup> kilograms), the
size of an atom, and would emit gamma rays (the highest energy form of
light)<a href="breferences.html#sup1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  When the universe
was 1/10,000 of a second old, those primordial black holes had a chance to
absorb enough matter to have this mass.  I recall one author saying that
these little guys would be the best power source we could find.  They are
too small for us to worry about falling in, and they would put out lots of
clean energy.
