<P>I took and passed the Sun Certified Java Programmers Exam in
September 1998. I am based in the UK and so some sources in this
document will have a UK bias. This documents concentrates on the
Programmers Certification, rather than the Developers exam. Please

<H2>1) General Stuff</H2>
<H3><A NAME="1.1)"></A>1.1) What Java Certifications exist?</H3>
<P>In a press release on 20 May 1999 IBM, Novell, Oracle, Sun
Microsystems and the Sun-Netscape Alliance announced a collaboration
to establish a standard for recognition of Java skills. In the short
term this probably does not affect most people as the current Java
Certified Programmers exam remains the pre-requisite for all of the
other exams. This new alliance does seem to be very good news however
in that a wider recognition of the certification exam means it should
become more valuable. The announcement also introduces some vendor
specific exams, so after you have passed the Programmer Exam you can
take a test to show your knowledge of a particular development tool
such as IBM Visual Age or Oracle JDeveloper. I am not sure of the
timescale of availability for these additional exams.</P>
<P>You can find out more about this new collaboration at</P>
<P><A HREF="http://java.sun.com/cert-initiative/faq.html">http://java.sun.com/cert-initiative/faq.html</A></P>
<P>For the moment Sun have three Java Certifications, programmer and
developer and architect. The programmer certification tests basic
understanding of the language and is entirely exam assessed. The
developer certification tests for advanced Java knowledge and
comprises an programming assignment and then answering questions
about your design. IBM also have the Certified VisualAge for Java
Object-Oriented Associate Developer. This involves two multiple
choice tests. The one is the Sun Certified Java Programmer test and
the other is a test on Visual Age for Java. A new outfit has come
onto the scene doing Java testing. You can find out more about them
from <A HREF="http://www.tekmetrics.com/">www.tekmetrics.com</A></P>
<P>The Architects exam seems to be aimed at training you up to be a
Java evangelist, ie why Java/Corba is the one true way and why
activeX, com/dcom is the work of the devil. I suspect that Peter van
der Lindens book Not Just Java - A Technology Briefing might be a
first text for such a certificate.</P>
<P>Information is a little slim on this one, I have found a
discussion group on it at <A HREF="http://my.netian.com/~scja">http://my.netian.com/~scja</A>
and I have started a discussion at <A HREF="http://www.jchq.net/discus">http://www.jchq.net/discus</A>.
Heather McKenzie has made her notes available from the excellent site
run by Ian Wojtowicz. Check at the front of <A HREF="http://javacert.com/">http://javacert.com</A>,
down towards the bottom A book has just come out from New Riders by
Jamie Jaworski that includes some coverage of the Architects exam.
Let me know if you find out any more information about the architects
exam.</P>
<P>You can find a little more about all the exams from Rob Masters at
<A HREF="http://www.spirit.net.au/~robm/cert/">http://www.spirit.net.au/~robm/cert/</A>.
I have a page of resource links at
<A HREF="http://www.jchq.net/faq/jarchitect.htm">http://www.jchq.net/faq/jarchitect.htm</A>.
As of April 2000 the Architects exam is under extensive revision and
a new version is expected later in the year. See my discussion forum
for the latest news. Check out <A HREF="http://prasks.webahn.com/">http://prasks.webahn.com/</A>
for some excellent info from Palani.</P>
<H3><A NAME="1.2)"></A>1.2) What are the benefits of becoming
certified?</H3>
<P>Being certified will demonstrate to employers a minimum level of
knowledge of the Java language. Because Java is a relatively new
language there are few people with extensive practical experience. It
will also concentrate your mind on the fundamentals of the language.
With the proliferation of GUI based tools it is possible to create
good looking Java applications without understanding what is going on
&quot;under the hood&quot;. It doesn't try to cover all of the Java
technologies. You can become certified an still know nothing about
JavaBeans, Corba, RMI or servelets. <BR>&#160;</P>
<P>There is no simple answer to the questions &quot;how&quot;much
more will I be paid if I am certified&quot;. I have seen figures of
USD5K to 10K, but I believe this is just wild guesses. Welcome to the
free market.</P>
<H3><A NAME="1.3)"></A>1.3) What happens when new versions of the
exam come out</H3>
<P>Re-certification means you will have to re-take the new version of
the exam, rather than just the updated features of the new version.
So far there have been versions of the exam for JDK 1.0x and 1.1 and
since February 1999 the Java2 exam has been available. Because the
Programmers exam concentrates on the core of the language you
probably won't gain much from upgrading from one version to the next,
except a slight gloss on your resume. As of 5 October 200 a slightly
revised version of the exam has been released. You can read more
about this revision at <BR><A HREF="http://www.jchq.net/faq/ExamUpdate.htm">www.jchq.net/faq/ExamUpdate.htm</A></P>
<H3><A NAME="1.4)"></A>1.4) Is the rumor about certification true?</H3>
<P>I get a constant trickle of questions from people who have heard a
rumor that the exam or the objectives are about to change. I am often
told that someone has heard this from a &quot;friend&quot;. If you
hear from a friend, rather than ask me, why not ask them where they
heard it from?</P>
<P>A particularly popular rumor I have been hearing for a long time
is that the programmers exam will include questions on Swing and or
networking. Generally I don't know any more than anyone else who
reads everything they can find on the net. And if I do find anything
out I will make that information available as soon as I can.&#160;</P>
<H2>2) Learning Resources</H2>
<H3><A NAME="2.1)"></A>2.1)What books will help get me Java
certified?</H3>
<P>When looking at Java Certification books check to see if the
authors print their email addresses and make an online errata
available. There is no such thing as a technical book without errors.
I always take an email address as good sign that the authors are
willing to receive feedback from the paying public Check out the
reviews at Amazon to see what other people think. Then buy from some
other source and email the people at Amazon to tell them what you
think of their policy taking out software patents on obvious
technology such as web shopping baskets.</P>

</A>Some people regard this as the bible on certification as the
authors were very involved with the creation of the certificaiton

<P>It would probably be possible to study take and pass the exam by
owning one of these books, and intense reading of online resources.
Having two would make it easier however. Beware of Java 1.1
Certification Training Guide By Cary A Jardin . It has not had
favorable reviews and you would be very strongly advised to read the
comments at <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/">http://www.amazon.com</A>
before spending money on it. Actually you should read the reviews of
that book anyway. Check out the main Java FAQ

useful resource. <BR>&#160; <BR>&#160;</P>
<H3><A NAME="2.2)"></A>2.2) Is it a good idea to do a classroom
course?</H3>
<P>Sun do a one week course with an emphasis on Certification. I did
this course in 1997 in the UK and decided that for me it probably
wasn't worth It cost the big end of GBP1,500 (around US$2140 ish)&#160;&#160;
and although the lecturer was excellent I could have bought an awful
lot of Java books and online courses for that amount of money.
Although it covers the topics required for the exam the course does
not go into details such as giving you mock exams. It is probably
more appropriate to the corporate customer for whome time is more
important than money and doing the course with sun is a case of&#160;
&quot;getting it from the horses mouth&quot;. It does look quite good
on a resume to say you have done the Sun course.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2.3)"></A>2.3)Are any online/web courses available?</H3>
<P>The good thing about online/web courses is that you can work in
your own time at your own pace and with a good course you get email
or online chat access to real live tutors.</P>
<P>CertifyOnline <A HREF="http://www.certifyonline.com/">www.certifyonline.com</A>
have considerable experience with delivering online education. They
are not particularly cheap but they seem to be good.</P>
<P>DigitalThink <A HREF="http://www.digitalthink.com/">http://www.digitalthink.com/
</A>do online courses for both the Programmers and Certification
exam. I got on the beta evaluation for the Programmers course and was
impressed with what I saw. You get feedback from a real live human
being. The Programmers course costs about US$325.</P>
<P>JCertify is an exam simulator and training product organised
around the objectives of the 1.1 exam. It costs $69.95.&#160;&#160;
Additional information on the product can be found at:
<A HREF="http://www.enterprisedeveloper.com/jcertify">http://www.enterprisedeveloper.com/jcertify</A></P>
<H3><A NAME="2.4)"></A>2.4) Some of the questions in R&amp;H or Boon
seem to be wrong, is it me or them?</H3>
<P>See the errata for these books, address in section 2.1, film at
11.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2.5)"></A>2.5) I'm already a Java programmer, will I
have to study?</H3>
<P>Yes you probably will. The exam asks all sorts of tricky questions
that you might not consider in the real world and may not know the
answer to. Thus a question may take the form of</P>
<P>&quot;If you were to write this particularly stupid piece of code
you would never dream or need to write, what would be the output.&quot;</P>
<P>This side of the certification can put some people off.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2.6)"></A>2.6) Is Certification Easy/How long will I
have to study?</H3>
<P>No, it seemed harder than the Novell CNE exams or the Microsoft
MCP Visual Basic Exams. I only passed on the second attempt and
plenty of people including experienced Java programmers take more
than one attempt. This is frustrating when you don't pass but at
least it should keep the value of certification high.</P>
<P>It is very hard to say how long you will have to study to pass.
Sun suggest you may have to study for three months after taking their
classroom course. If you are new to the language I would suspect that
6 months plus is more realistic.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2.7)"></A>2.7) Where can I find mock/test exams?</H3>
<P>My research has located Mock exams on the net that total around
480 Sample Questions, let me know if you find more. (please don't ask

<H3><A NAME="2.8)"></A>2.8) Are any newsgroups/mailing lists
dedicated to Java Certification ?</H3>
<P>There are no public newsgroups devoted to Java Certification. The
discussion group at <A HREF="http://www.javaranch.com/">http://www.javaranch.com</A>
has a very active Java Cert discussion forum amongst its many java
related discussions. I run a discussion forum on Certification at
<A HREF="http://www.jchq.net/discus">http://www.jchq.net/discus</A>.
I recommend following the discussions on both systems and when you
have a questions use the search facilities to see if your question
has been asked previously.</P>
<P>Although there are no newsgroups specifically for java
certification there are several for general java questions, notably.</P>
<P>comp.lang.java.programmercomp.lang.java.help</P>
<P>If you are new to the language I recommend browsing/lurking at
first, as if you ask a question that has been asked before or seems
obvious to the men in beards, they can be a bit testy. On the other
hand you never have to see them face to face. A good way to get the
benefit of these groups it to go to <A HREF="http://www.dejanews.com/">http://www.dejanews.com</A>
and do a power search on the java news groups.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2.9)"></A>2.9) Do I need Visual Cafe/JBuilder/VisualAge
etc to learn Java?</H3>
<P>No, you could easily do the whole learning thing with just the JDK
as it comes at the back of one of the certification books, or
downloading from Sun. However the debugger that comes with the JDK is
fairly awful, so you could benefit from one of these tools. If money
is tight you can get very functional versions of these tools either
from the cover disks of magazines or downloading from the web. An
example of this is that Borland/Inprise had a copy of JBuilder 1 on
the cover of a magazine in the UK around about the time <FONT SIZE=2>JBuilder</FONT>
2 came out. Beware that Microsoft J++ is not utterly compatible with
that used by everyone else. It might be useful for getting extra
performance for windows apps, but you can worry about that once you
truly know the language.</P>
<H3><A NAME="2.10)"></A>2.10) Are there any online free certification
online tutorials?</H3>
<P>There are large numbers of general Java Tutorials and some
Certification material. My own site (the home of this FAQ) has been
under very active construction for over two years (including 6 months
full time) and probably contains more material and links than any
other site. It aims to be a comprehensive freely available resource
with links to other online certification resources. If you were to
print out the Tutorial, Mock Exams, FAQ and various other web pages
you would probably require about 400 sheets of paper. You can also
find links to general Java Tutorials and Java FAQ at
<A HREF="http://www.apl.jhu.edu/~hall/java/FAQs-and-Tutorials.html">http://www.apl.jhu.edu/~hall/java/FAQs-and-Tutorials.html</A></P>
<P>Jyothi Krishnan has put together an excellent set of pages based
around the Java2 Objectives at

managers and heaps more stuff.</P>
<P>A good source of certification tips is the Java Skinny at
<A HREF="http://www.acmerocket.com/skinny/">http://www.acmerocket.com/skinny/.</A>
Sun have a general Java Tutorial available at
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/information/download.html">htp://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/information/download.html,
</A>It is does cover Java 2 but it is an 8MB download. You can
download the text of Bruce Eckels <A HREF="http://www.BruceEckel.com/">Thinking
in Java</A> which is an excellent, if a little advanced book.</P>
<P>Michael Thomas is in the process of creating a Certification Site
at <A HREF="http://www.michael-thomas.com/">http://www.michael-thomas.com.
</A>.Looks promising.. He has some very interesting training stuff
aimed at certification including sample apps and a syllabus. Dang I
got a rival!</P>
<P>For more Cows than you can shake an instantiated class at, check
out <A HREF="http://www.javaranch.com/">http://www.javaranch.com</A>
. Javaranch will either puzzle you or amaze you. It combines humor,
graphics and explanations of the principles of Java. It's not exactly
an exam tutorial, but you will end up better prepared. Much of the
site was created by Kathy Kozel who is a Sun Certified Java so
Instructor. This material was merged with the discussion forums of
Paul Wheaton in 1999 which cover all the main Java Certification
topics plus general Java subjects. But if you want really good Java
Certification Discussion come on over to <A HREF="http://www.jchq.net/discus">http://www.jchq.net/discus</A>
as the people who hang out there are taller, better looking and the
coffee tastes better.</P>

<H3><A NAME="3.2)"></A>3.2) What are the formal objectives (the
syllabus) of the exams?</H3>
<P><A HREF="http://suned.sun.com/USA/certification/java/certification_details.html#programmer">http://suned.sun.com/USA/certification/java/certification_details#programmer</A></P>
<H3><A NAME="3.3)"></A>3.3) How much does it cost to take the exam?</H3>
<P>Of course these prices will vary over time but they should give
you a good general idea</P>
<P>UK=GBP 117.6 inc VAT <BR>US=US$150 <BR>Germany= DM 270, + tax,
that's a total of DM 313,20 (thanks Sven) <BR>India= Rs.7000/-. (the
price has gone up recently so do check it)<BR>Spain= 34800 PTS total
( 30.000 + IVA ) - 210 EUROS, (thanks Javier) <BR>Brazil=R$ 200,00
(thanks Rafael) <BR>Singapore=S$224. (thanks Chitra)
<BR>Canada=&gt;$160.10(cdn) (thanks Manoj) <BR>South Africa = R970
(thanks Jan)</P>
<P>(Anyone with prices from other countries please let me know)</P>
<P>There is no penalty for re-taking the exam as many times as you
like apart from the drain on your finances.</P>
<H3><A NAME="3.4)"></A>3.4) Where can I take the exam?</H3>
<P>Contact Sylvan Prometric for exam sites or check out their exam
centre locator on their web site at <A HREF="http://www.prometric.com/">http://www.prometric.com</A></P>
<H3><A NAME="3.5)"></A>3.5) Who administers the exams?</H3>
<P>The exams are run by Sylvan Prometric, the same people who run the
Novell and Microsoft Exams. The task of actually having a room with a
computer etc is delegated to training companies. Participating
Training companies can be found all over the world.</P>
<H3><A NAME="3.6)"></A>3.6) Can I just turn up and take the exam?</H3>
<P>No, you need to contact Sun, pay for the exam and they will send
you a voucher. This will come as a letter and attached to it is the
voucher, which is a slip of paper printed with the magic serial
number. You then contact Sylvian, quote the number and tell them
where you want to take the exam. You negotiate the available time and
book the exam. Be aware that the exam has an expiration date of about
6 months from the date of issue. I got mine &quot;free&quot; with the
Sun course and it had expired before I took the exam. They sent me a
new one for free however.</P>
<H3><A NAME="3.7)"></A>3.7) Can I take the exam on a weekend?</H3>
<P>Here in the UK there was at least one company that was arranging
for the exams to be taken on a Saturday, so you might be in luck.</P>
<H3><A NAME="3.8)"></A>3.8) Where and when can I see my results
online</H3>
<P>I'm not sure how long it takes before they can be seen online, I
suspect the delay is measured in weeks rather than days. You will
need your sylvan testing Id which you will find somewhere in your
paper work. The URL for the database is
<A HREF="https://www.galton.com/%7Esun_s/login.html">https://www.galton.com/~sun_s/login.html</A>.</P>
<H2>4) Actually taking the exam</H2>
<H3><A NAME="4.1)"></A>4.1) How many questions and how long is the
exam?</H3>
<P>The exam consists of around 60 questions. Most people do not find
that time is a problem and you will probably finish with time to
spare. It does not appear to be one of those tricky adaptive exams
that concentrates on the stuff you don't know.</P>
<H3><A NAME="4.2)"></A>4.2) What if I have questions where there is
no apparently correct answer?</H3>
<P>You may get questions in the exam that have no apparently correct
answer. If you are sure there is no correct answer ignore the
&quot;reminder&quot; at the end that you have not answered this
question.</P>
<H3><A NAME="4.3)"></A>4.3) How quickly do you get the exam results?</H3>
<P>Almost immediately. Once you have decided you have answered all
the questions to the best of your ability, or run out of time, you
click the mark (or is it finish) button. The machine whirrs for about
15 (very long) seconds and then pops up a message either offering
congratulations on passing or informs you have not passed. It then
prints out a sheet giving a breakdown on how well you fared on
different sections. Thus you might get 100% on language fundamentals
but 0% on AWT painting. The only thing that really matters is getting
60% or more overall. <BR>&#160;</P>
<H3><A NAME="4.4)"></A>4.4) What do you get when you pass?</H3>
<P>About a month after passing you get a certificate and badge from
Sun. The Certificate does not show your pass grade so if you only
pass by one mark nobody but you needs to know. I have a picture of
the badge <A HREF="http://www.jchq.net/faq/badge.htm">http://www.jchq.net/faq/badge.htm</A>.
You also get some artwork with an agreement on how it can be used.
The agreement essentially says that the logo should not be used to
imply you represent Sun Microsystems and cannot be the dominant
component of the item it is used on.</P>
<H3><A NAME="4.5)"></A>4.5) What is the pass mark for the Programmers
exam ?</H3>
<P>61%</P>
<H3><A NAME="4.6)"></A>4.6) What format does the exam take, is it all
multiple choice?</H3>
<P>The exam is run on a Windows Computer and is mostly multiple
choice. This can take the form of either radio buttons with only one
correct answer or check boxes with zero or more correct answers. A
few questions ask you to key in a line of code. It would appear
easier to know the correct answer yet still not get the mark for this
type of question. The exam software is very helpful and it allows you
to mark a question that you have a doubt about and go back and review
the questions. Once you are happy with all of your answers you then
press the button to say you are finished. Only at that point are your
questions considered final. Once the exam has started you must stay
in the exam room. You should be provided with a pen/pencil and scrap
paper for the exam. These can be useful for working out questions
related to LayoutManager questions. Be aware that if you get a
computer monitor with a small screen you may have to scroll up and
down to see all of the question. As of October 200 each question will
inform you of how many options are correct.</P>
<H3><A NAME="4.7)"></A>4.7) Does the exam include negative marking?</H3>
<P>No, but you will get no credit for a multiple choice question
unless you mark all of the correct options</P>
<H2>5) The Developers Exam</H2>
<H3><A NAME="5.1)"></A>5.1) How much does the Developers Exam Cost?</H3>
<P>There are two parts to the developer certification. The first, the
assignment costs $250. The second is the exam which is the standard
$150 Sylvan Exam. If this sounds like a large amount of money to keep
spending if you fail, the good news is that it's a one off cost. To
Quote a Sun representative &#160;</P>
<P>&quot;Unlike our other exams, these are one time fees. If your
assignment does not pass, our assessor will return it to you with
comments and give you an opportunity to improve it.&quot; <BR>&#160;</P>
<H3><A NAME="5.2)"></A>5.2) How much time do you have to do the
Developers Assignment?</H3>
<P>One year</P>
<H3><A NAME="5.3)"></A>5.3) How long before you get the results of
the Developer Exam ?</H3>
<P>About 4 weeks.</P>
<P>The person who sent me this information (Thanks Heather), also
said</P>
<P>&quot;The exam is *hard* - much harder than the Java 1.1
Certification Exam Guide <BR>would lead you to believe. Just being
familiar with your assignment is not enough.&quot;</P>
<H3><A NAME="5.4)"></A>5.4) What study resources are available for
the Developers Exam ?</H3>
<P>Not a lot seems to be the answer to that question. I have put up a
link to some resources at <A HREF="http://www.jchq.net/faq/scjd.htm">http://www.jchq.net/faq/scjd.htm</A></P>

find out. (see the main page of the tutorial)</P>
