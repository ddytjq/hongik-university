Abstract
<p>
We have presented in a companion article a kinematic study of three
       E+E galaxy pairs, NGC 741/742, 1587/1588 (CPG 99) and 2672/2673 (CPG
       175). We find some evidence for perturbed velocity and velocity
       dispersion profiles. These perturbation features are now reported for 14
       galaxies in the literature. They occur, or require observations for
       detection, at large radii where the S/N in the data is low. While
       observations of individual galaxies are sometimes uncertain, the large
     number of objects where such features are suspected gives confidence that
       they are real. These perturbations can be attributed to projection
       effects, contamination along the line of sight, or directly to the tidal
       interaction. We report the results of several self-gravitating
       simulations of unbound pairs in an effort to better understand these
       perturbations and other generic features of close E+E pairs reported in
       the literature. The models frequently show off-center envelopes created
       by the asymmetry of tidal forces during interpenetrating encounters. The
       envelopes last for a few 10^8^yrs, which explains the frequency of such
       features in observed pairs. This phenomenon is stronger in the
       self-gravitating simulations than in the MTBA runs. U-shaped (and an
       equal number of inverse U-shaped) velocity profiles are seen in the
       simulations, a result of ablation in the outer envelopes. Simulations
       including inner galaxy rotation also preserve this feature, irrespective
       of the spin vector direction in each galaxy. U-shape velocity structure
       is found to be a robust indicator of the ongoing interaction. All
       simulations show evidence for enhanced velocity dispersion between the
       galaxies even in the case of simple superposition of two non interacting
       objects. We therefore conclude that this cannot be considered an
       unambiguous indicator of the interaction.
