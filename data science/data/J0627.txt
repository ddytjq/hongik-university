Graddy ran the entire race in the top four swapping positions with several drivers but led the all important last lap. Pole sitter Gerry Mullins from Toppenish Washington led the first three laps until he was overtaken by Auburn’s Ron wolf in a ’02 Pontiac.

<h2>Skagit Speedway June 22nd Results</h2><h3>GOOD AND BAD NIGHT FOR SOLWOLD</h3>
 

(June 22nd)Skagit Speedway had a great crowd and a good car count for tonight’s race. There was no let down following the very best Jim Raper Memorial Super Dirt Cup in years.  Sixty-five 410, 360 and Sportsman Sprinters made the trip to Alger for tonight’s race. The weather cooperated, a little dryer than most of us in Washington are accustomed to but warm and balmy for the fans. Fast times tonight were claimed by Jason Solwold in both 360s and 410s. Jason won his 360 heat as well as the 360 A-Main, however, his hopes for a sweep were dashed when a front wheel on his 410 broke and he hit the turn 1 wall in the 16th lap of the A-Main. Cal Herdson took over the lead in his 3c and kept it to take the checkered in the 410 A-Main event. In a yellow plagued but thrilling Sportsman A-main event, Matt Steinhauer of the Rudeen Racing Team fought off Rick Smith for the win.

<h2>CenturyTel Northwest Modified Nationals<br>
Grays Harbor Raceway Park Elma, WA</h2> <h3>Reversal of fortune: Chadwick claims top prize at NW Modified Nationals</h3>
By Craig Murphy<p>

(June 15, 2002)Elma, WA- Kellen Chadwick said he hated to see Dennis Silva's bad fortune. Still, the irony of the situation must have amazed Chadwick as he roared past Silva's stricken car to claim the $5,100 top prize Saturday night in the third annual Northwest Modified Nationals at Grays Harbor Raceway Park.

On Friday night, Chadwick dominated until a mechanical problem dropped him out of contention with three laps to go.

On Saturday night, Silva dominated the 40-lap main event from the pole until a mechanical problem handed the lead to Chadwick with three laps to go.
