				<font class="news">It has all the earmarks of being one of the supreme tragedies of this era in Indian cricket. There are shades of similarity to any number of Hindi movie potboilers. The young impecunious lad striking it rich in the face of numerous difficulties bunged into his path by assorted elements of the underground.<br><br>Well, apart from the fact that Ganguly comes from a rather well-to-do family and that the people who bunged their spanners into his path were the members of the Indian cricketing establishment, the parallels are amazing.<br><br>Here was this shy young lad, with an almost aristocratic air around him, or so they said. His first tour with the Indian cricket team, to Australia, turned out to be disastrous. He played the lone match, scoring little, and spent the rest of the time as a waterboy. And, according to some sources, an uppity waterboy at that.<br><br>One has to commiserate. To tour at such a young age was sure to leave some mental scars. Or would it? Fortunately, Ganguly the boy had lots of nerve and courage and character, to go back, turn a deaf ear to all that his detractors said and work his way up the ladder again.<br><br>When he did get the chance in the Second Test in England in 1996, boy, did he grab it with both hands. Two centuries in successive innings and he was suddenly the new co-messiah of Indian cricket along with Rahul Dravid. (Indian cricket doesn&#8217;t allow any Gods other than Sachin, which is the reason for both Ganguly and Dravid being designated as co-messiahs at that point in time).<br><br>Those were the days of plenty for the Prince. Runs flowed from his willow like brooks and streams in the mountains, fresh and invigorating. His offside play was peerless, his driving a joy to behold. Geoffrey Boycott called him the &#8220;Prince of Kolkata&#8221; and truly, his march through the cricketing landscape was regal and majestic.<br><br>Eventually, he came to occupy the throne, after Sachin Tendulkar, the reigning emperor vacated it out of disgust. His coronation was cheered by the multitude of Indian fans. His attitude, later to be much reviled by one and all, was seen as aggressive and positive, a far cry from some of the other Indian captains of the past.<br><br>Here at last was an Indian captain who didn&#8217;t back down from confrontation on the field. He looked in charge, in command of the situation. The icing on the cake was of course, the Indian series triumph against the all-conquering Aussies.<br><br>Steve Waugh, putting into practice his theory of &#8220;mental disintegration&#8221; had fired his first salvos at the Indians even before he left the Australian shores. However, he was in for a surprise when, unlike the Indian captains of the past who would rather turn the other cheek, Sourav Ganguly gave back as good as he got, and more.<br><br>It was quite obvious that the Aussie game plan was to target Ganguly, since the fall of the leader eventually leads to the demise of the side. Ganguly, however, despite his batting woes, refused to be cowed down. He counterattacked verbally against the Aussies and even seemed to have got under the skin of the tough Steve Waugh.<br><br>Boosted by some spectacular batting by VVS Laxman, ably assisted by Dravid and Tendulkar, and some aggressive bowling by Harbhajan Singh, the Indians came back to win the final two Tests after losing the first, thus putting paid to Steve Waugh&#8217;s hopes of conquering the &#8220;Final Frontier&#8221;.<br><br>If the Indian fans assumed that the victory over the Aussies would enable the Indian team to maintain the high that they were on, they were sadly mistaken. Overseas tours beckoned, and the Indians, when away from home had always shown as much courage and resilience as a slab of butter to a hot knife.<br><br>Things started to go depressingly downhill for the Indians when the Zimbabweans managed to draw the series. The Sri Lankan tour was an unmitigated disaster with an Indian team missing some 'stars' and being beaten by the Lankans, 2-1.<br><br>It was around this time that murmurs started going around as to how Ganguly&#8217;s captaincy was affecting his form, or lack thereof. To put it bluntly, his batting had gone downhill faster than the Indian team&#8217;s fortunes. <br><br>The tour to South Africa was one of the worst for Ganguly, personally. The bowlers all over the world had now worked out the fact that he was, to put it diplomatically, as comfortable against the short-pitched stuff as a fish is when taken out of its aquatic environment.<br><br>His form in the one-dayers had been spectacular, with him slashing away over the head of the slips and gully to anything pitched short. However, Test cricket was an entirely new ball game, and sadly, his technique was found lacking.<br><br>The runs through the offside that had submitted to his dictates like a vassal state, now seemed to have dried up with a mind of their own. No longer was there an assurance about his play through the covers. His batting seemed to be interspersed with short spells of evasive tactics, followed by a tentative push/prod that invariably resulted in the slips getting some catching practice.<br><br>What this working over did to his confidence is not something that would require any great mental gymnastics. It was shot. And that reflected itself in the way his later innings went.<br><br>Even on the supposedly benign wickets in India, Ganguly was worked out quite comprehensively by Flintoff and Hoggard. This in turn affected his captaincy, with the once aggressive captain, now seemingly going through the motions.<br><br>It almost seemed as if he had lost the confidence of the players and one doesn&#8217;t have to have read <i>The Art of War</i> to realize that when that happens to the general of an army, the general is usually asked to pack up his bags and head to the nearest golf links to spend the remaining part of his life. It hasn&#8217;t happened to Ganguly yet, but it is almost a certainty now that it will.<br><br>Apart from the general denunciation of his batting, critics were also voicing increasing concern over his &#8220;brash&#8221; behaviour. The very aggressiveness that had been much appreciated by his fans during the Australia series, was now being derided as being the result of childishness and petulance and not worthy of someone leading a national squad.<br><br>To be honest, most of the criticism about his brashness came from foreign scribes. However, his failures with the bat during the past year or two seems to have finally caught up with him, with even the most ardent Indian fan demanding that the selectors start thinking of alternate captains. The prince had indeed become the pauper. <br><br>There is a line of thinking in India that says that Ganguly can&#8217;t be removed from the team, since There Is No Alternative (also known as the TINA factor) to Ganguly.<br><br>The argument goes something like this. Since Tendulkar is too valuable a commodity as a player - it wouldn&#8217;t be right to wreck his batting by saddling him with the additional responsibilities of a captain. Dravid, the vice captain, himself is struggling for form. Kumble too, is hardly a certainty for his place in the side. The only other certainty is Javagal Srinath, and somehow, he isn&#8217;t exactly captaincy material. Which then brings us back again to Ganguly as the captain.<br><br>However, this view is certainly shortsighted. A captain, first and foremost, has to be one who can earn his place in the side on the merits of his performance, unless he happens to be one of a certain tactical brilliance, like Mike Brearley (who it must be remembered would have failed for all his tactical brilliance without a certain Beefy Botham in his side).<br><br>Ganguly is neither a brilliant tactician in the Brearley mould, nor a good strategist. Quite frankly, his form doesn&#8217;t merit him a place in the side. It might be to his own good to go back to playing domestic cricket, work out the chinks in his armour and then make a more successful return to the Test side.<br><br>After all, most batsmen, at some point or the other have had to work on some deficiency or the other. Even the great Brian Lara had to work out some of the chinks in his armor after having them pointed out to him by Sir Gary Sobers. <br><br>Maybe, the new Ganguly would, having conquered whatever demons exist in his mind, come back to reclaim his lost kingdom and glory. Until then, one is sorry to say, his continuance in the team, as a captain or even as a batsman is simply unacceptable.<br><br>- <i><a href="mailto:the_crumpet@hotmail.com">Arun Krishnan</a></i></font><br>
