Component Bugs<BR>Open Beta Information</H2>
<H4 STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">This page lists all of the
known problems with the TaeRichEdit Component.&nbsp; So far, the bug
list is surprisingly short given the size of the component code.&nbsp;
Also listed below are usage notes, bug work-arounds, and new features
and tools.&nbsp; You should check this page for the most current
information about the TaeRichEdit Component.</H4>
<HR>
<P><B>November 28, 1999 (1.0.0.1)</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><B>Bug:</B>&nbsp; After printing once,
TTaePrintDialog Pages is disabled (grayed out) even though the
document is more than one page long.<BR><B>Status:</B>&nbsp; Fixed in
version 1.2 (01-09-00).</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><B>Bug:</B>&nbsp; After printing,
preview headers and footers are not displayed in the correct
font.<BR><B>Status:</B>&nbsp; Fixed in version 1.2 (01-09-00).</P>
<HR>
<P><B>January 9, 2000 (1.0.0.2)</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><B>Bug:</B>&nbsp; Pete Fraser reports
that the IDE inserts incorrect template for the OnProtectChange
event.&nbsp; IDE inserts &quot;void __fastcall
TForm1::TaeRichEdit1ProtectChange(TObject *Sender, int NumObjects,
int NumChars, bool &amp;SaveClipboard) {}&quot;.&nbsp; The correct
template is &quot;void __fastcall
TForm1::TaeRichEdit1ProtectChange(TObject *Sender, int StartPos, int
EndPos, bool &amp;AllowChange) {}&quot;. <BR><B>Status:</B>&nbsp;
Problem confirmed.&nbsp; Note that signature is correct -- the
parameter names are simply misleading.&nbsp; Still researching but,
so far, this looks like an IDE bug.<BR><B>Work-around:</B>&nbsp;
Ignore the parameter names or change them to match the declaration.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><B>Bug:</B>&nbsp; Richard Farley
reports that the WordWrap property is declared twice when
VCL_COMPATIBLE is #define'd as true.<BR><B>Status:</B>&nbsp; Still
under review.&nbsp; Warning: This will probably be &quot;fixed&quot;
by removing the VCL_COMPATIBLE compile option.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><B>Bug:</B>&nbsp; Richard Farley
reports that, after setting the Transparent property to true in the
IDE, setting it back to false had no effect.&nbsp; He noted that he
had not tested the run-time effect.<BR><B>Status:</B>&nbsp; Still
under review.</P>
<HR>
<P><B>January 24, 2000 (1.0.0.3)</B></P>
<P><B>Bug:</B>&nbsp; Hopefully, this last of the major bugs is
fixed.&nbsp; I failed to include the &quot;PACKAGE&quot; modifier on
quite a few class declarations.&nbsp; Many thanks to Stefan
Hoffmeister for solving this one.<BR><B>Status:</B>&nbsp; Fixed.</P>
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp; The distribution has been restructured to move
the demonstration application to a separate subdirectory.</P>
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp; Be sure to install the component files on the
same drive that BCB is installed on.</P>
<P><B>Note:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">&nbsp; A printer
driver must be installed and set as the default printer.&nbsp; The
component will throw exceptions if a default printer is not
installed.</SPAN></P>
<P><B>Note:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">&nbsp; If you are
able to build the component but get a mysterious &quot;device
attached to the system is not functioning&quot; error when installing
the package, substitute &quot;false&quot; for the
SHGetPathFromIDList() call used in TaeUtility.cpp.&nbsp; I have some
vague recollection of a known problem with some versions of Win9x
that do not properly export this function (Win95 B has been reported
so far).&nbsp; If this solves the problem, please let me know so that
I can better solve this.</SPAN></P>
<P><B>Note:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">&nbsp; The
TaeAdjLineBrks.cpp module is recompiled/assembled on every project
make even though it has not been changed.&nbsp; This is normal.</SPAN></P>
<HR>
<P><B>January 28, 2000 (1.0.0.4)</B></P>
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp; Added a TaePageSetupDialog component.&nbsp;
This component allows users to specify page margins using the
standard Windows Page Setup Dialog.&nbsp; There is not yet any
documentation for this component.&nbsp; See the demonstration
application for an example of how to use the component.</P>
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp; Moved the TTaePreviewForm files to a separate
subdirectory (.\Extras) since it is not, strictly speaking, part of
the component.</P>
<HR>
<P><B>February 2, 2000 (1.0.0.5)</B></P>
<P><B>New:</B>&nbsp; Added new OnProtectEvent and OnLinkEvent
handlers. You should look first at the related OnProtectChange and
OnUrlClick events but, if you need full access to the Windows
EN_PROTECTED or EN_LINK message information that accompanies these
messages, these events provide that information.&nbsp; None of the
documentation reflects this change yet.&nbsp; Anyway, thanks to Pete
Fraser for asking questions that led to the idea.</P>
<P><B>Bug:</B>&nbsp; Code using SelText generates a compile-time
error.<BR><B>Status:</B>&nbsp; Confirmed and fixed.</P>
<P><B>New:</B>&nbsp; The component now contains a RichEditVersion
property which identifies the Rich Edit DLL as version 1.x, 2.x, or
3.x.&nbsp; This is primarily useful in distinguishing between
versions 2.x and 3.x.</P>
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp; The &quot;Extras&quot; folder now includes a
&quot;Tools&quot; subfolder.&nbsp; I plan to put useful tools here.&nbsp;
Currently, there is only one &quot;tool&quot; here -- a sample
program that searches for Rich Edit DLLs and returns version
information for DLLs that are found.&nbsp; This tool may be useful
for customer support.</P>
<HR>
<P><B>February 11, 2000 (1.0.0.6)</B></P>
<P><B>New:</B>&nbsp; Added properties to TTaeRichEdit simplify
support for OLE drag and drop&nbsp; (OLE support is still rather
incomplete -- I am still looking for volunteers.)&nbsp; I have not
tested extensively -- I do know that the component now allows
dragging text to/from/within the control.&nbsp; See the
OleAllowTextDrag and OleAcceptDrop properties.</P>
<P><B>Changed:</B>&nbsp; Revised the RichEditVersion and
RichEditVersionInfo properties that return information about the
currently loaded Rich Edit DLL.&nbsp; The RichEditVersion and
RichEditVersionInfo properties should no longer cause GPF's on
Windows NT.</P>
<P><B>New:</B>&nbsp; Added ProtectEvent and LinkEvent events.&nbsp;
These events provide access to all of the information that Windows
has available in underlying WinAPI notification messages are sent.&nbsp;
This would be useful if, for example, you needed to react to mouse
move messages while the mouse was over link text.&nbsp; This change
may affect the way that the OnProtectChange and OnUrlClick events
work, so please see the code if you are using these events.</P>
<P><B>Bug:</B>&nbsp; There was a rather obscure VCL bug that affected
some (but not all) versions of the Rich Edit control when more than
~64KB of text was loaded in the control and using Lines-&gt;Append()
and Insert().<BR><B>Status:</B> Solved.&nbsp; The changes are in
TTaeRichEditStrings::GetCount() if you care to look at them.&nbsp;
Note that the fix is enabled only when compiling for Rich Edit 2.0+.&nbsp;
The Rich Edit 1.0 behavior is unchanged.</P>
<P><B>Note:</B>&nbsp; There may be a problem with the way that the
component determines long file names on some platforms.&nbsp; So far,
I believe that the problem is limited to Win95B installations.&nbsp;
The problem has to do with certain versions of Windows not properly
exporting SHGetPathFromIDList(), SHGetPathFromIDListA(), or
SHGetPathFromIDListw() from shell.dll.)&nbsp; The fix is to rewrite
the Get:LongFileName() function in TaeUtility.cpp to build the long
filename differently or, for now, simply return the &quot;filename&quot;
parameter unchanged.</P>
<HR>
<P><B>February 19, 2000 (1.0.0.7)</B></P>
<P><B>New:</B>&nbsp; Added classes for Microsoft RTF converter
support.&nbsp; These were in the early beta versions and removed. Now
they are back.</P>
<P><B>New:</B>&nbsp; A partially complete help file is now available
as a separate download on the <A HREF="TaeRichEditInfo.html" TARGET="_top">TaeRichEdit Component Information</A> page.</P>
<P><B>New:</B>&nbsp; Added FindWordBreak(), FindWord(), and
SelectWord() methods. Added application demonstrating using these
methods for basic syntax highlighting.</P>
<P><B>Bug:</B>&nbsp; Found problems with garbage left in the DemoApp1
program makefile. Caused link problems looking for PageSetupDlg and
components.lib.<BR><B>Status:</B>&nbsp; Fixed.</P>
<HR>
<P><B>May 22, 2000 (1.0.0.8)</B></P>
<P><B>Changed:</B>&nbsp; I used an ugly hack in TaeRichEdit.cpp to
allow the component to access certain VCL code declared as
&quot;private.&quot;&nbsp; With Stefan Hostmeister's help, I have
eliminated most, but not all, of the code that required the hack.</P>
<P><B>New:</B>&nbsp; Added a #define to work around the Windows API
SHGetPathFromIDList() shell export bug.&nbsp; See the
TaeCompileOpts.h file for an explanation of the problem and the
#define that you can change.&nbsp; So far, I think this bug applies
to Win95B only.&nbsp; Please let me know if you find out differently.</P>
<P><B>Bug:</B>&nbsp; Although not reported, I found what I think was
a rather obvious bug in the new TTaeRichEdit::GetTextRange() method.&nbsp;
I must have been asleep when I wrote that code.<BR><B>Status:</B>&nbsp;
Fixed but largely untested.</P>
<P><B>Bug:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">&nbsp; I also found
obvious bugs in the TTaeRichEdit::Print() method.&nbsp; Apparently, I
was asleep when writing that code, too.<BR></SPAN><B>Status:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">&nbsp;
Fixed but largely untested.</SPAN></P>
<P><B>New:</B>&nbsp; Added two new methods for OLE support.&nbsp; The
first is TTaeRichEdit::InsertBitmap() which allows you to
programmatically insert a bitmap into the control.&nbsp; The second,
TTaeRichEdit::InsertContainerObject() allows you to programmatically
insert the contents of a TOleContainer into the control.&nbsp; Be
warned that I am not an OLE expert and, therefore, both of these will
require some thorough testing.&nbsp; If you use them, please give me
some feedback.</P>
<P><B>Note:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">&nbsp; The following
problem seems to come up from time to time:&nbsp; If a program that
uses the TaeRichEdit Component is run on a machine which has no
printers installed or which has no &quot;default&quot; printer, the
VCL will throw an exception.&nbsp; Strangely, the exception may
indicate that it was caused by something that has nothing to do with
the component nor anything clearly related to a printer problem.<BR><BR>I
am investigating ways to trap this within the component code.&nbsp;
However, I suspect that it may be a bit harder than it seems and I
have no &quot;misconfigured&quot; systems on which to test.&nbsp; For
now, be aware that this is the first thing that you should ask a user
reporting problems after installation.&nbsp; You should consider
adding defensive code within your program or providing a diagnostic
tool that checks for installed printers.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><B>New:</B>&nbsp; A few programmers
have been kind enough to share their code.&nbsp; Look in the
&quot;Extras\User Contributed&quot; folder for the code.&nbsp; Be
sure to read the ReadMe.rtf file in that folder before trying to use
any of this code.&nbsp; Thanks to those that shared.</P>
<P><B>May 25, 2000 (1.0.0.8)</B></P>
<P><B>New:</B>&nbsp; Ported the component and demonstration projects
to Borland C++ Builder 5.&nbsp; It is functionally identical to the
BCB4 version.<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">&nbsp; See the &quot;BCB5
ReadMe.rtf&quot; document in the distribution file for notes on
changes, instructions for installation, and tips on upgrading
existing projects.</SPAN></P>
<HR>
<P><B>June 7, 2000 (1.0.0.9)</B></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><B>Bug:</B>&nbsp; Several users have
struggled with problems using the component with certain HP
printers.&nbsp; I was finally able to reproduce the problem -- or at
least, produce a problem.&nbsp; If you have encountered GPF problems
using the DemoApp1 demonstration program, this version should fix the
problem. <BR><B>Status:</B>&nbsp; Fixed (I hope).&nbsp; Please let me
know if you find further problems.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><B>Changed:</B>&nbsp; Added code to
the BCB4 version of the component to bring the BCB4 and BCB5 code
base together.&nbsp; The component source code is now identical for
both versions.&nbsp; In fact, all of the distribution code is now
identical except for the project files which are still unique to the
BCB version.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><B>Changed:</B>&nbsp; Removed an
unnecessary #include from the TaeAdjLineBrks.cpp file.&nbsp; It
should now compile more quickly.</P>
<HR>
<P><B>June 14, 2000 (pending)</B></P>
<P><B>Bugs:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">&nbsp; <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Bojan
Resnik </SPAN></SPAN>reported several problems with the component.&nbsp;
The bad news is that the problems have been present for most --
perhaps all -- releases.&nbsp; The good news is that Bojan took the
time to report them so there is a really good chance that they will
be fixed very soon.</P>
<P>Bojan reported the following problems:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The component code is generally not exception-safe.&nbsp;
	Making the code exception-safe is no small challenge, but one that I
	originally intended to address.&nbsp; I simply forgot and now, some
	thousands of lines later, will have to rectify.</P>
	<LI><P>The code improperly tests STL iterators for &quot;&lt;&quot;.&nbsp;
	As Bojan pointed out, &quot;!=&quot; is the only valid and portable
	iterator comparison.&nbsp; This was news to me (thanks for the
	explanation, Bojan) and I will change the code.&nbsp; On the other
	hand, there is absolutely nothing portable about a Borland VCL
	component that implements a Microsoft Rich Edit control.&nbsp; (If
	you want to change this by contributing to an open-software Rich
	Edit control project, see the <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><A HREF="TaeRichEditInfo.html" TARGET="_top">TaeRichEdit Component Information</A> page.)</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P>TTaePageStyleList::Clear() is badly flawed.&nbsp; It stupidly
	decrements the pointer twice on each iteration and results in a
	guaranteed memory leak.&nbsp; Clearly, I was asleep when writing
	this code.</P>
	<LI><P>The code is not &quot;const-friendly.&quot;&nbsp; That is,
	there are many methods that do not modify the parameters or class
	variables.&nbsp; To make things more efficient for the compiler, I
	plan to revise the code with &quot;const&quot; modifiers where
	appropriate.</P>
</UL>
<P><B>Status:</B>&nbsp; Reported, not fixed.</P>
<HR>
<P><B>September 9, 2000 (incremental fixes not yet in full release)</B></P>
<P><B>Bugs:</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">&nbsp; Henry Seltzer
reported problems using the component with certain printers.&nbsp;
Notably, users experienced GPFs when clicking OK from the TaeRichEdit
Component's TTaePrintDialog dialog when using certain HP DeskJet
printers.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"><B>Status:</B>&nbsp; I have
posted a set of fixes for this problem and addressed some of <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Bojan
Resnik's concerns (above) about STL compatibility.&nbsp; The download
also includes fixes for problems not previously reported.&nbsp; The
changes are not yet fully incorporated into the component beta
distribution code but are available on the <A HREF="TaeRichEditInfo.html" TARGET="_top">TaeRichEdit Component Information</A> page as a set of replacement *.cpp &amp; *.h files.</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<HR>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4><B>*** The
TaeRichEdit Component's Features Were Frozen With The 1.0.0.8 Release
***</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><B>What does that mean?</B>&nbsp;
First, I will, of course, continue to fix any bugs that are
reported.&nbsp; Next, I plan to remove the rather lame attempts at
compatibility with the Rich Edit 1.0 DLL and, by reference, with the
VCL TRichEdit component.&nbsp; The RE 1.0/TRichEdit compatibility was
incomplete anyway and, based on the kinds of questions and comments
that I receive, I believe that this will not affect many of you.&nbsp;
However, if you see this as a problem, please say so now.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Next, I have spent a lot of time
adding new functionality.&nbsp; This takes much more time than you
might think.&nbsp; While I plan to add many more features, I really
need to finish the help files and improve the sample applications.&nbsp;
And, although I thought that I made clear that the component requires
an installed and defined <I>default</I> printer, apparently this was
not as clear as it should have been.&nbsp; So, I need to add
defensive code to the component....</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Finally, I have ported the component
to BCB5.&nbsp; This leads me to the following question:&nbsp; Should
I continue to support BCB4?&nbsp; This is a tough call and I would
appreciate your comments.&nbsp; Keep in mind that I have limited
resources, so think of it this way:&nbsp; Would you rather that I
continue to support BCB4 or would you prefer that I add new features
and support only BCB5?&nbsp; Now is your chance to influence the
direction that this project takes.&nbsp; As they say, &quot;speak now
or forever hold your peace.&quot;</P>
