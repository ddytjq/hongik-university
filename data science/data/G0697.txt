How do Astronomer's Measure the Density of the Universe?
</H1>

<P>
In order to measure the density of the Universe, it is necessary to sample
a region that is larger than the scale on which the Universe becomes
approximately homogeneous.  The volume of this region must then be measured,
as well as the mass of the matter it contains.  The ratio of mass to volume
then gives the density.
</P>

<P>
The volume of the surveyed region obviously depends on the
<A HREF="./distance.htm">distance</A> of the objects at the edge of the region.
The volume of a sphere of radius <EM>R</EM> is given by
<EM>V = (4*pi/3)R<SUP>3</SUP></EM>.  The radius is the distance 
<EM>D<SUB>max</SUB></EM> of the
most distant object in the sample.
Since the region has to be rather large, this distance will be determined
using the Hubble Law.  If <EM>z<SUB>max</SUB></EM> is the maximum 
<A HREF="./doppler.htm">redshift</A> at the edge of the region, then
<EM>D<SUB>max</SUB> = cz<SUB>max</SUB>/
<A HREF="./glossary.html#H0">H<SUB>o</SUB></A></EM>
is the radius of the surveyed region, and the volume is<BR>
<EM>V = (4*pi/3)*(cz<SUB>max</SUB>/H<SUB>o</SUB>)<SUP>3</SUP></EM>
if the whole sky is surveyed.
</P>

<P>
The mass of an object can be derived from the orbital velocities of the
particles within the object.  Consider a mass on a string that you
swing around.  As you make the mass go faster, the pull you need to
exert on the string gets larger and larger.  If you replace the string
by a central mass, this means that the central mass must be larger
if the orbital velocities are larger.
When applied to clusters of galaxies we find a mass to luminosity ratio
that implies a density of the Universe that is about 0.3 times the
critical density.
</P>

<P>
A moderately technical further discussion of these idea follows below,
with links to more detailed derivations.
</P>

<P>
The mass of the objects in the surveyed region is determined using
the virial theorem or one of its variants, which states that
<PRE>
v<SUP>2</SUP> = GM/R
</PRE>
where <EM>v</EM> is a typical velocity of an particle within the object
relative to the center of mass of the object, <EM>R</EM> is an effective
radius of the object, <EM>M</EM> is the mass, and
<EM>G</EM> is Newton's gravitational constant.  
In words, the virial theorem states that twice the kinetic energy is
equal to the magnitude of the potential energy.
[A more technical derivation can be found in the 
<A HREF="./virial_tech.html">
lecture notes</A> from my undergraduate course.]
For particles in circular orbits, <EM>v</EM> is the
circular orbital velocity and <EM>R</EM> is the radius of the orbit.
For hot X-ray gas in clusters of galaxies, 
<EM>v</EM> is the typical thermal velocity and is determined by
the temperature of the gas.
But the radius <EM>R</EM> is determined using an angular size
<EM>theta</EM> and the distance, <EM>D = cz/H<SUB>o</SUB></EM>,
so <EM>R = theta*D = theta*cz/H<SUB>o</SUB></EM>.
Therefore the mass is given by
<PRE>
M =  R*v<SUP>2</SUP>/G = theta*cz*v<SUP>2</SUP>/GH<SUB>o</SUB></EM>
</PRE>
If the object has a measured <A HREF="./glossary.html#flux">flux</A>
<EM>F</EM> then its luminosity is given by
<PRE>
L = 4*pi*F*(cz/H<SUB>o</SUB>)<SUP>2</SUP>
</PRE>
and thus the mass-to-luminosity ratio of the object is
<PRE>
M/L = (H<SUB>o</SUB>/cz)*theta*v<SUP>2</SUP>/(4*pi*F*G)
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
If <EM>N</EM> objects of this mass are seen in the surveyed volume,
then the derived density of the Universe is given by
<PRE>
rho = N*M/V = N*(3/4*pi)*&lt;theta*cz&gt;/(cz<SUB>max</SUB>)<SUP>3</SUP>*(v<SUP>2</SUP>/G)H<SUB>o</SUB><SUP>2</SUP></EM>
</PRE>
Note that <EM>&lt;theta*cz&gt;</EM> means the average value of this product,
but since more distant objects have higher redhifts and lower angular sizes,
the product should be fairly independent of distance.
This density has the same dependence on the Hubble constant as the
critical density, so we determine the ratio of the density to the
critical density,
<A HREF="./glossary.html#Omega">Omega</A>, directly.
When applied to clusters of galaxies these techniques give
approximately <EM>Omega = 0.3</EM>.
</P>

<P>
We can also compute the luminosity density of the sampled region:
<PRE>
N*L/V = N*&lt;F*(cz)<SUP>2</SUP>&gt*H<SUB>o</SUB>/[3*(cz<SUB>max</SUB>)<SUP>3</SUP>]
</PRE>
The luminosity density of the Universe is about
<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0012085">175 million</A>
solar luminosities per cubic 
<A HREF="./glossary.html#parsec">Megaparsec (Mpc)</A> 
at visual wavelengths for <EM>H<SUB>o</SUB> = 65</EM>.
Since the critical density is 120 billion solar masses per cubic Mpc,
the mass-to-luminosity ratio of the Universe needs to be 700 solar if the
Universe has the critical density.  But based on the masses of clusters
of galaxies, the ratio is only 300 solar.
But the mass-to-luminosity ratio of the solar neighborhood is only 3 solar!
Thus the Universe has a mass that is 100 times larger than the mass of the
stars that we see.  There is a large amount of <A HREF="./glossary.html#DM">
dark matter</A> that we see only through its gravitational effects.
</P>

<P>
If we use the virial theorem on galaxies instead of clusters of galaxies
then we get a mass-to-luminosity ratio that is about 30.
Thus the mass-to-muinosity ratio appears to vary with the size of the region
measured, from 3 in the solar neighborhood to 30 in galaxies to 300
in clusters of galaxies.  Is there a possibility that for even larger objects
the ratio could reach the critical value of 1100?  For such large regions
we cannot use the virial theorem because these regions are still expanding
with the Hubble flow.  
However, we can compute the gravitational acceleration due to the large
density contrasts in the nearby superclusters.  The density contrast,
<EM>d(rho)/rho</EM>, can be measured by counting galaxies.  The gravitational
acceleration is proportional to <EM>d(rho)</EM> which is the measured
density contrast times the unknown density.   The gravitational
acceleration times the age of the Universe gives our peculiar velocity
relative to the <A HREF="./glossary.html#CMB">CMB</A>, which can be
determined from the <A HREF="./glossary.html#dipole">dipole</A>
<A HREF="./glossary.html#isotropic">anisotropy</A> of the CMB.
Different groups have reached different conclusions
about whether the resulting <EM>Omega</EM> could reach the critical value 
of 1. But it definitely appears that the 
<A HREF="http://cfpa.berkeley.edu/darkmat/dm.html">dark matter 
fraction</A> increases 
with the size of objects at least up to clusters of galaxies (1 Mpc radius).
</P>

<P>
We can use the observed abundances of hydrogren, helium and lithium isotopes
to estimate the total density of baryons in the Universe.  This gives
a value of 6% of the critical density for <EM>H<SUB>o</SUB> = 65</EM>.
Since the <EM>Omega = 0.3</EM> from clusters of galaxies is much larger than
0.06, most of the matter in the Universe must be 
<A HREF="./glossary.html#baryon">non-baryonic</A>.
</P>

<P>
One proposed way out of the need for dark matter is to modify the law of
gravity.  This is done in the 
<A HREF="http://www.astro.umd.edu/~ssm/mond/faq.html">Modification 
Of Newtonian Dynamics</A> [MOND]
theory of Milgrom.  There are several papers about MOND on the
astro-ph preprint server:

<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9810302">2</A>,

<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9303012">20</A>.
While this alternative to non-baryonic dark matter is not widely accepted,
it is not suppressed by the establishment, as proved by these citations.
<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0105184">Aguirre, Schaye &amp;
Quataert (2001)</A> find that while MOND works well on galaxy scales,
it fails for Lyman alpha clouds and clusters of galaxies.
The basic problem with MOND on cluster scales is that a point mass in MOND
gives the observed isothermal profile in clusters, but most of the mass in
clusters is due to a diffuse cloud of hot gas. 
Thus the observed gas density profile generates a gravity field under MOND
that is not consistent with the observed gas temperature and density profile.
