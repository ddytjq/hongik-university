								</span>By investing in a MINI Cash ISA, you will not be able to invest in a MAXI ISA in any tax year in which you subscribe to your MINI Cash ISA.

							<li><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"><span class="style368">An ISA may not be transferred from one investor to another.</span></font>
							<li><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"><span class="style368">You must be resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom for tax purposes or, if not so resident, perform duties which, by virtue of section 132(4)(a) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (Crown employees serving overseas), are treated as being performed in the United Kingdom, or married to a person who performs such duties and will inform Marsden Building Society if you cease to be so resident and ordinarily resident or to perform such duties or be married to a person who performs such duties.</span></font>

						<dt><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica">To prevent the inflow of speculative investments interfering with our ability to provide a quality service to customers, the Society has imposed a minimum investment of &pound;250, which must be maintained, on this and a number of other products. As the minimum opening balance for a Marsden MINI Cash ISA is, therefore, greater than &pound;10 this product does not meet the CAT standard as defined by HM Treasury in this regard.</font>
