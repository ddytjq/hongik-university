Joe, Like many youngsters, came through the FA's School of Excellence at Lilleshall. But how did he get on there and has it stood him in good stead for a future in football?<br>
"I was homesick quite a lot. It did me a lot of good to stay and tough it out. Once you have gone through two years there you can go through anything.There were a lot of times when i thought about giving up and going home but it's all about character building. The football made me stay."<p>

Turning pro is one of the most difficult things to do. So how did Joew do it?<br>
"If you want to be a player as badly as i do you have to be ready. You have to make yourself ready and I know I will. As soon as the whistle goes in any game I'll be fine. You do the same things everywhere. People talk about pressure but I'm prettm comfortable with at the moment.<p>

West Ham are renowned for their productive youth system. Is that why Joe joined?<br>
"I fell in love with West Ham when I was 11. I came here at twelve and just liked it. It's not big or flash. It's what football should be. Ir felt right because I'd been to a lot of clubs and none of them felt friendly. There were a lot of good players around and lots of characters around who got me involved."<p>

Joe's been brought in gradually but it surely can't be long before he's the first name on the team sheet?<br>
"I wouldn't want to be breaking into a team that isn't doing well. With last years experience i feel more comfortable with the first team. I feel fitter and stronger too."<p>

And how has being at West Ham helped him become the star he is and who does he look up to in the Hammers squad?<br>
"I knew I would learn from being with the senior team but really I just wanted to make a bit of an impression myself. I was never left out of training or left to clean boots. It was blinding. We always play England players against foreign players in training at West Ham. It's really competitive. We always want to beat the foreigners. But you do pick up good habits from the foreigners, from how they behave on and off the pitch. All the foreigners seem to take more time in the stretches and warm-downs. You don't often see foreign players pulling up with a muscle injury. Their lifestyles are really good. I try to learn off everybody, Neil Ruddock for defending, Paolo Di Canio for going forward and so on."<p>

Harry Redknapp has been keen to protect Joe from all the media attention and keep his feet on the ground. He's become Joe's mentor at the club.<br>
"Harry Redknapp has been great with me. I trust him to do the right thing. I've only been in football five minutes so what do I know."<p>

Being a pro means big money, flash cars and twenty bedroom mansions. Or does it? Joe tells us how he's keeping it real.<br>
"You can't change your life just because you're playing football. At least not until you have to. I'm not a famous face yet and I rarely get noticed. Even when people do they don't come up to me. As far as my lifestyle off the pitch goes, making the first team hasn't changed much in my life."<p>

One of the most important influences in Joe's career has been his family. Joe talks a bit about those who have stuck by him from the start.<br>
"I've got a great family. Whatever happens they'll be there for me. That's good in football because you're going to have downs. Probably more downs than ups. If you've got you're family there you can turn your back and forget."<p>

There's a lot of hype around Joe's explosion onto the Premiership football scene. Like Michael Owen Joe is going to have to deal with it. But he seems to be taking it in his stride...<br>
"There is a lot of expectation on me. Since I was 15 I have always been in the papers. It's not something I wanted. When I was making my debut at Old Trafford, people were watching me to see what I could do. It should be: 'Here's a 17-year old playing at Old Trafford, good luck to him; if he does alright then brilliant.' But people were looking for me to do something special. It is pressure but it doesn't worry me."<p><!-- text below generated by server.
