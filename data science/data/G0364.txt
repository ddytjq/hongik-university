<p>
The actual process of 
<a href="http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Outreach/Edu/sform.html"><i> star 
formation</i></a> remains shrouded in mystery 
because stars form in dense, cold molecular clouds whose dust obscures newly 
formed stars from our view.  For reasons which are not fully understood, but 
which may have to do with collisions of molecular clouds, or shockwaves 
passing 
through molecular clouds as the clouds pass through spiral structure in 
galaxies, or magnetic-gravitational instabilities (or, perhaps all of the 
above) the dense core of a molecular cloud begins to condense under its 
self-gravity, fragmenting into stellar mass clouds which continue to condense
forming <i>protostars</i>.  As the cloud condenses, gravitational potential 
energy is released - half of this released gravitational energy goes into 
heating the cloud, half is radiated away as thermal radiation.  Because
gravity is stronger near the center of the cloud (remember 
F<sub>g</sub> ~ 1/distance<sup>2</sup>) the center condenses more quickly,
more energy is released in the center 
of the cloud, and the center becomes hotter than the outer regions.  As a 
means of tracking the stellar life-cycle we follow its path on the
Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram.<p>

<h3><u>1. Protostar</u></h3></font>

The initial collapse occurs quickly, over a period of a few years.  As the 
star heats up, pressure builds up following the Perfect Gas Law:
<p>
<center><h3><font color="red">
	PV = NRT
</center></h3></font>
where, most importantly P=pressure and T=Temperature.  The outward pressure 
nearly balances the inward gravitational pull, a condition called 
<i> hydrostatic equilibrium</i>.

<li> Energy Source: <font color="red"><i>Gravity</i></font>
</ul></h3></font>
The star is cool, so its color is red, but it is very large so it has a high 
luminosity and appears at the upper right in the H-R Diagram.

<p>
<font color="blue">
<h3><u>2. Pre-Main Sequence</u></h3></font>

Once near-equilibrium has been established, the contraction slows down, but 
the star continues to radiate energy (light) and thus must continue to contract
to provide gravitational energy to supply the necessary luminosity.  The star 
must continue to contract until the temperatures in the core reach high enough 
values that nuclear fusion reactions begin.  Once nuclear reactions begin in 
the core, the star readjusts to account for this new energy source 
Gravity releases its potential energy 
throughout the star, but due to the very high temperature dependence of the 
nuclear fusion reactions, the proton-proton chain is highly centrally 
concentrated.  During this phase the star lies above the main sequence;
such pre-main sequence stars are observed as

T-Tauri Stars</a>, which are going through a phase of high activity.
Material is still falling inward onto the star, but the star is also spewing 
material outward in strong winds or jets as shown in the

<h3><u>3. Zero Age Main Sequence</u></h3></font>

It takes another several million years for the star to settle down on the 
main sequence.  The main sequence is not a line, but a band in the H-R
Diagram.  Stars start out at the lower boundary, called the <i>Zero-Age
Main Sequence</i> referring to the fact that stars in this location have 
just begun their main sequence phases.  Because the transmutation of Hydrogen 
into Helium is the most efficient of the nuclear burning stages, the main 
sequence phase is the longest phase of a star's life, about 10 billion yrs
for a star with 1 solar mass.
<ul><h3><font color="blue">
<li> Age: 		<font color="red">27 million yrs</font>
<li> R ~ 		<font color="red">R<sub>sun</sub></font>
<li> T<sub>core</sub> = <font color="red">15,000,000K</font>
<li> T<sub>surface</sub> = <font color="red">6000K</font>
<li> Energy Source: <font color="red"><i>P-P Chain</i> in core.</font>
</ul></h3></font>
During the main sequence phase there is a "feedback" process that regulates 
the energy production in the core and maintains the star's stability.  The 
basic physical principles are:
<ul>
<li> The thermal radiation law, L ~ R<sup>2</sup>T<sup>4</sup>, determines the 
energy output, which fixes requirement for nuclear energy production.
<li> The nuclear reaction rates are very strong functions of the central 
temperature; Reaction Rate ~ T<sup>4</sup> for the P-P Chain.
<li> The inward pull of gravity is balanced by the gas pressure which is 
determined by the Ideal Gas Law: PV=NRT.
</ul>
A good 
way to see the stability of this equilibrium is to consider what happens if we 
depart in small ways from equilibrium:
Suppose that the amount of energy produced by nuclear reactions in the core is 
not sufficient to match the energy radiated away at the surface.  The star 
will then lose energy; this can only be replenished from the star's supply of 
gravitational energy, thus the star will contract a bit.  As the core 
contracts it heats up  a bit, the pressure increases, and the nuclear energy 
generation rate increases until it matches the energy required by the 
luminosity.
<br>
Similarly, if the star overproduces energy in the core the excess energy
will heat the core, increasing the pressure and allowing the star to do work 
against gravity.  The core will expand and cool a bit and the nuclear energy 
generation rate will decrease until it once again balances the 
luminosity requirement of the star.

<h3><u>6. Red Giant - Helium Flash</u></h3></font>

As the Helium core of the star contracts, nuclear reactions continue in a 
shell surrounding the core.  Initially the temperature in the core is too
low for fusion of helium, but the core-contraction liberates gravitational 
energy causing the helium core and surrounding hydrogen-burning shell to 
increase in temperature, which, in turn, causes an increase in the rate of 
nuclear reactions in the shell.  In this instance, the nuclear reactions are 
producing more than enough energy to satisfy the luminous energy output.  
This extra energy output pushes the stellar envelope outward, against the 
pull of gravity, causing the outer atmosphere to grow by as much as a factor 
of 200.  The star is now cool, but very luminous - a <i>Red Giant</i>.<p>
(You do the arithmetic:  200 x 700,000km = ?; where will the outer radius of 
the sun be?) 
 <p>

<ul><h3><font color="blue"> 
<li> Age: 		<font color="red">100 million yrs from Point 5</font> 
<li> R ~ 		<font color="red">200R<sub>sun</sub></font>
<li> T<sub>core</sub> = <font color="red">200,000,000K</font> 
<li> T<sub>surface</sub> = <font color="red">3500K</font> 
<li> Energy Source:	<font color="red"><i>P-P Chain</i> in shell around 
core; <br>Ignition of

</ul></h3></font> 

The contraction of the core causes the temperature and density to increase
such that, by the time the temperature is high enough for Helium nuclei to
overcome the repulsive electrical barrier and fuse to form Carbon, the core
of the star has reached a state of <i>electron degeneracy</i>.  Degeneracy
comes about due to the <i>Pauli Exclusion Principle</i>, which prohibits
electrons from occupying identical energy states.  The core of the Red
Giant is so dense that all available lower energy states are filled up.
Because only high-energy states are available, the core resists further
compression -- there is a pressure due to the electron degeneracy.  This
pressure has a significant difference from pressure produced by the Ideal
Gas Law -- it is independent of temperature.  This removes a key element in
the feedback-stability mechanism that regulates hydrogen burning on the
main sequence.

<h3><u>7. Helium Burning Main Sequence</u></h3></font>
Once again the core of the star readjusts to allow for a new source of energy, 
in this case fusion of Helium to form Carbon via the Triple-Alpha Process.
The Triple alpha process releases only about 20% as much energy as hydrogen 
burning, so the lifetime on the Helium Burning Main Sequence is only about 
2 billion years.  
<ul><h3><font color="blue">

During this phase some Carbon and Helium will fuse
<p>
<center> <sup>12</sup>C + <sup>4</sup>He --> <sup>16</sup>O</center>
<p>
resulting in the formation of a Carbon-Oxygen core.  When the Helium is 
exhausted in the core of a star like the sun, no further reactions are 
possible.  Helium burning may occur in a shell surrounding thecore for a 
brief period, but the lifetime of the star is essentially over.
<p>

<font color="blue">
<h3><u>8. Planetary Nebula</u></h3></font> <img align=right valign=top src="./images/Ring.jpg">

When the helium is exhausted in the core of a star like the sun, the C-O core 
will begin to contract again.  Central temperatures will never reach high 
enough values for Carbon or Oxygen burning, but the Helium and Hydrogen 
burning shells will conyinue burning for a while.  Throughout the star's 
lifetime it is losing mass via a stellar wind, like the solar wind.  This mass 
loss increases when the star swells up to the size and low gravity of a Red 
Giant.  During Helium Burning, thermal pulses, caused by the extreme 
temperature sensitivity of the 3-alpha Process, can cause large increases in 
luminosity with accompanying mass ejection.  During Helium Shell Burning, a 
final thermal pulse produces a giant "hiccough" causing the star to eject as 
much of 10% of its mass, the entire outer envelope, revealing the hot inner 
regions with temperatures in excess 100,000K, shown in this
<a href="./images/anim/helix.mpg">animation of the Helix</a>, below.  The 
resulting 
<a href="http://www.seds.org/messier/planetar.html">Planetary Nebuala</a>
is the interaction of the newly ejected shell of gas with the more slowly 
moving ejecta from previous events and the ultraviolet light from the hot 
stellar remnant, which heats the gas and causes it to fluoresce. The Ring

stellar remnant, supported by 
<a href="http://xrtpub.harvard.edu/xray_sources/white_dwarfs3.html">electron 
degeneracy</a>, to fade away as it cools

of order 1 million g/cm<sup>3</sup>, about equivalent to crushing a volkswagen 
down to a cubic centimeter or a "ton per teaspoonful."

A white dwarf star will take billions of years to radiate away its store of 
thermal energy because of its small surface area.  The white dwarf will slowly
move down and to the right in the H-R Diagram as it cools until it fades from 
view as a "black dwarf".  To the right is the white dwarf companion to the 
nearby star Sirius.
