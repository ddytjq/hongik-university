      <tr>
        <td width="232" valign="top"><font face="Arial" size="2">Business ethics, although a
        difficult concept to define, can encompass:</font><ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">general principles of duty</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">rules of conduct</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">moral principles</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Most organisations will be expected to follow certain moral
        or ethical conventions. Indeed there should be no real difference between the values of
        business and those we apply to other aspects of our daily lives. These include honesty,
        fairness, respect of standards, and to offer value in return for the trust placed in us.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ansvar sees ethical standards as embodied in the concept of
        professionalism which means:</font><ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">adhering to the ABI Codes of Practice</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">regularly monitoring its ethical stance </font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">extending current knowledge base by acquiring new knowledge</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">judging each case individually to offer the best solution</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">continually striving for higher standards</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">following best practice, even though it may be financially
            disadvantageous</font></li>

        <td width="232" valign="top"><font face="Arial" size="2">More specifically, Ansvar's
        ethical policy guidelines on trading and investments are derived from its specialisation
        within the church and charity sectors and also its roots within the Temperance movement.
        They are summarised as follows:</font><p><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">Investments</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There should be no investments in shares of a company where
        the predominant proportion of that company's turnover or profit derives from the brewing
        and distilling of alcoholic beverages, tobacco production, armaments production and gaming
        or betting activities.</font></p>
        <p><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">Trading</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Commercial Lines:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ansvar is precluded from selling to organisations whose
        main business is involved in the selling of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, armaments and
        gaming or betting activities.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Personal Lines:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ansvar's market focus is individuals who are closely
        connected to the 'non profit' sector through:</font><ul>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">active church membership</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">committed voluntary work</font></li>
          <li><font face="Arial" size="2">regular charitable tax effective giving e.g. CAF
            CharityCard, Give As You Earn, Covenant etc. </font></li>
