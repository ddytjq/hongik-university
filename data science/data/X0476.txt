    <td width="100%" colspan="2"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Its been
    a decade since the huge chestnut defied history to record a second successive
    Doncaster-Epsom double over the famous mile course at Randwick. A year later he again
    stunned those who said he was well past his best in defeating one of the best line ups in
    a WS Cox Plate. He carried the colours of racing legend Carbine who had taken all before
    him in Australian racing 100 years before.</font></strong><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">His story began in New Zealand where he was foaled at John Grant's
    Meadowland Stud and then offered for sale at the 1986 Trentham Yearling Sales. His sire
    Imposing was himself a flashy chestnut by champion Todman (by Star Kingdom) and had been a
    brilliant racehorse winning the 1979 Group 1 Epsom Hcp and Group 1 George Main Stakes at
    Randwick after earlier winning the now Group 1 Stradbroke Hcp. Retired to stud he sired
    many Group 1 winners in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa including Credit Account,
    Golden King, Importune, Imposera, Petrava and Solveig. Super Impose's dam was the unraced
    Pheroz Fancy by Taipan, who also had Star Kingdom in his pedigree, from Pheroz Jewel the
    winner of 8 races including the Group 2 ARC George Adams Hcp also the dam of talented sire
    El Qahira. Super Impose was her first foal. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Trainer Lee Freedman attended the Trentham
    sale and picked out three yearlings from the catalogue he was interested in. The other two
    which ultimately sold to the Bart Cummings stable turned out to be class racehorses Beau
    Zam (champ 3yo of 87-88) and Sky Chase (sire of Saintly). For the price of $NZ40,000 the
    chestnut son of Imposing and Pheroz Fancy was heading to Victoria and the Freedman stable
    in the ownership of C Biggins, G Longbottom, J Journeaux, R Moffat, J Newton and K
    Fawcett..</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">His racing career was delayed when during
    his early breaking in his forelegs began to show the beginnings of bowed tendons so he was
    spelled for 10 months to heal the problem. When he entered training as a 3yo he showed
    promise and won a barrier trial at Epsom before heading the races for the first time. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Super Impose made his racing debut at
    Seymour in late December 1987. He gave nothing else a chance in leading all the way to win
    by 3 1/2 lengths from Mighty Kaoru with a further 2 lengths to Klondike in third. Two
    weeks later he ran second beaten only a neck to Ranchero Star in an Improvers Hcp at
    Seymour. His first run on a metropolitan track produced a third at Sandown beaten only 3/4
    length and a nose by Past Habit and King and Coda. A fortnight later he produced a shocker
    beaten over 25 lengths in a race at Moonee Valley. Returned to the country tracks he
    returned to form running second to Just Eartha beaten by a half head in a Geelong
    Progressive before another second in a 2000m Improvers Hcp at Colac. Given a short let up
    he bolted home 6 lengths clear over 1200m at Benalla. This win was impressive enough for
    Super Impose to be returned to the city racetracks where he encountered a heavy track at
    Caulfield running 5th 6 1/2 lengths behind Haughty Lad. Until this point in his career
    Super Impose had been racing in the lead or close to it and defying his rivals to run him
    down. Then a race which would mark the start of his famous finishing burst occurred. In a
    race over 1400m at Flemington Super Impose missed the start and settled down near the
    rear. Turning for home he started to make up ground in a rush and despite being blocked
    for a run at one stage flew home to miss catching Chetford by a head. After another wet
    track run he was given a let up for the spring. After a third first up he returned to
    Flemington to take on the Open class horses. Despite drifting out to 50-1 in betting at
    one stage Super Impose showed he was up to the challenge in finishing fourth behind the
    well performed Bonded, stakeswinner Scarvila and Adraanito. Next he went to Caulfield to
    run second to multiple group 1 winner Eastern Classic beaten a neck leaving good
    performers Springfield Lad and Our Avon's Gold in his wake. A third at Geelong followed
    before he ran Crown Ridge to a half head on a Slow track at Flemington in the Grey Smith
    Stakes.</font></p>
    <p><img src="superimpose6.jpg" alt="superimpose6.jpg (11778 bytes)" align="right" border="1" hspace="10" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="194"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Super Impose was then
    set for the Ballarat Cup. Around the home turn he was behind the majority of runners and
    swung wide around the home turn. Great Warrior was running on from midfield with Betoota
    and Bronze Knight fighting it out halfway down the straight. By the 100m Great Warrior
    drew up to Betoota with Wolveraction between them and Super Impose charging down the
    outside. The wall of horses thundered towards the post where Great Warrior was in front by
    a nose from Wolveraction then Super Impose but after protests of second against first and
    third against second and first the placings were amended to Great Warrior holding first,
    Super Impose being promoted to second and Wolveraction third.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Back to the city and the Eclipse Stakes at
    Sandown Super Impose gave nothing else a chance in powering to the front at the 200m and
    going away from Crown Ridge to win by 2 1/2 lengths with Be Reasonable third. Super Impose
    was then taken to Sydney for the Christmas races. Entered in a Welter Super Impose made
    his run along the rails to hit the front in the final 150m and win easily by 2 1/2 lengths
    from Garoona who chased hard with Reaction third. He then started in the 2400m Summer Cup
    on boxing day where Brentano and Moniuszko were well clear by the 200m but Super Impose
    began to storm home down the outside. Under hands and heels riding he hit the lead by the
    100m and raced away to win eased up on the line by 2 lengths from Moniuszko with Brentano
    third.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Super Impose was then given a short spell
    before taking on Australia's best racehorses in his autumn campaign. First up he took on
    the proven Group 1 WFA horses in the CF Orr Stakes. Passing the 200m Vo Rogue led Marwong
    by 3 lengths with Super Impose (66-1) starting to storm home from the tail. In the run to
    the line Vo Rogue was too strong winning by 1 1/2 lengths with a further 2 lengths to
    Marwong third and Dandy Andy fourth. He couldn't match Vo Rogue in the St George Stakes
    and then took on a field minus the frontrunner in the TS Carlyon Cup at Caulfield. Black
    Charleston led for home but Super Impose burst from the pack to hit the front past the
    250m. In the run to the line he raced away to win by two lengths from Dandy Andy with
    Apollo Run third. Another second to Vo Rogue in the Australian Cup followed with Cox Plate
    winner Our Poetic Prince filling third place. Super Impose then headed to the Sydney
    carnival.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">The moment the chestnut landed in Sydney
    the rain started and eventually any hope of a start was abandoned as Super Impose then
    headed to Brisbane. He ran fifth behind Groucho in the Sir Byrne Hart Stakes before being
    beaten over 40 lengths and beating two others home on a bog track in the Hollindale Cup. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Super Impose was sent for a spell and
    resumed as a 5yo in the Grange Hcp over 1000m at Sandown. In slow conditions he ran on
    wide on the track from the rear to be 5 lengths behind Undoubted. Back to a firm track and
    Flemington he took on another class field in the Craiglee Stakes. Past the 200m Apollo Run
    was in front with Almaarad and Super Impose in pursuit. Super Impose tried to lay in as
    Apollo Run fought back with Almaarad between them. On the line Apollo Run held the lead to
    win by a nose from Almaarad with Super Impose a long neck away in third and a break to The
    Phantom taking fourth place. Dropped back to Open class for his next run Super Impose
    started as the odds on favourite. Painted Ocean took the lead as Super Impose started to
    run on from the back of the field. By the 200m Painted Ocean was going strongly as Super
    Impose moved to second from Water Boatman. In the concluding stages Painted Ocean was too
    good holding on to win by a neck from Super Impose with Water Boatman third. Five days
    later he ran a close fourth in the Underwood Stakes to Almaarad, Apollo Run and The
    Phantom. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Returning to his favourite track Super
    Impose again had Vo Rogue amongst his rivals and started at 7-1. On straightening Vo Rogue
    was well clear from Research with Super Impose a further three lengths back running on. By
    the 200m Super Impose had joined Research as they joined Vo Rogue with a break to Sydeston
    making ground. Inside the final 100m Super Impose came away to win by two lengths from
    Research with Sydeston finishing hard for third just ahead of Vo Rogue. It was then back
    to Caulfield where again he couldn't match Almaarad beaten 5 1/2 lengths into 9th place as
    Vitalic and Vo Rogue filled the placings. Continuing on the Cups campaign his next run was
    the Caulfield Cup. Soon after jumping Super Impose crossed from a wide barrier to be third
    last on the rails. By the 1400m Cosign led Dr Grace as Super Impose was well back behind
    Cole Diesel. Pasing the 800m Dr Grace took over from Cosign then Ideal Centreman and
    Sydeston as Cole Diesel ran on with Super Impose being checked as he tried to follow. On
    straightening Sydeston, Dr Grace and Cosign were fighting it out from a wall of horses
    with Cole Diesel finishing hard down the centre as Super Impose was again badly checked
    while being held up behind tiring horses. By the 200m Cole Diesel powered past the leaders
    to sprint away to victory from Nayrizi and The Phantom as Super Impose finally found a
    clear run finishing strongly to be only four lengths from the winner.</font></p>
    <p><img src="superimpose1.jpg" alt="superimpose1.jpg (13234 bytes)" align="left" border="1" hspace="10" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="223"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Two weeks later he took
    on the WFA performers in the Mackinnon Stakes. Vo Rogue led from Eye Of The Sky and
    Horlicks then Research as Super Impose dropped out to last. By the 1400m Vo Rogue strode
    along in front well clear from Eye Of The Sky and Fleetwood Lad followed by Horlicks and
    Research as Super Impose was still well back in second last place. On straightening Vo
    Rogue led Research gave chase from King's High and Horlicks as Super Impose swung wide to
    put in his effort. By the 200m Vo Rogue was challenged by King's High then Horlicks from
    Research as Super Impose charged down the outside. Inside the final 100m Horlicks hit the
    front to draw away and win by 3/4 of a length from King's High with Vo Rogue holding third
    from Super Impose.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Three days later he lined up in the big one
    the Melbourne Cup and was sent out at 25-1. Super Impose led in the early stages as the
    field settled into stride. Power of Destiny took over but Stylish Century after pulling
    fiercely eventually led the field past the post the first time with Coshking then Empire
    Rose three wide around Ideal Centreman and Super Impose. By the 1800m Stylish Century was
    joined by Empire Rose then Coshking and Power of Destiny followed by Ideal Centreman and
    Super Impose with Fleetwood Lad three wide. With 1100m left Kudz moved forward around
    Stylish Century and Coshking then Empire Rose and Power of Destiny with Super Impose
    pocketed on the rail inside Ideal Centreman. On straightening Kudz had raced well clear
    from Power of Destiny as Super Impose pushed his was out of the pocket to give chase from
    Fleetwood Lad. By the 300m Super Impose hit the front from Kudz as Lord Hybrow then
    Tawriffic started to fly home out wide. Passing the 200m Super Impose still held the front
    but Kudz was fighting back and Tawriffic was joining then out wide. Inside the final 50m
    Tawriffic started to come away to win from Super Impose who held off Kudz and The Phantom
    who flew home late. It was later revealed that Super Impose had been invited to represent
    Australia in the Japan Cup but connections had preferred to set their charge for the
    Melbourne Cup. In hindsight it was probably as wise decision as champion New Zealand mare
    at her peak became the first horse from this region to win the Japan Cup.</font></td>
