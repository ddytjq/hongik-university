 Reading the article from Georgi dimanchev on MTA airfoils, shouldn&#39;t the LD airfoils have a more rounded leading edge than used on most LD-booms at the moment as well ?? Current state of the art LD-booms make a lot of noise. I tried one, the noise is dramatically reduced and the distance looks fine and at least does not seem to decrease &#40;not officially measured yet&#41;.

 I read the article too. I think, at distances from 100-130m, a round leading edge may work. At my booms I descovered, that the noisy ones fly furthest. I also tried a concave leading egde &#40;!!&#41;, like my trailing edge on Voyager. The distance didn&#39;t increase, but the flight was very stable. This was about 2years ago. Now I tend to make all edges sharp and I make less &#34;bevels&#34;.That means: Most of material at l.edge is removed from top.

 Hmmm, sounds fair since I ussualy throw around these 130 meters. Thus I get the feeling that throwers with less strength could gain some from the rounded leading edge. I&#39;ll probably try a sharp edge again on my next attempt. <BR> <BR>About the bevel, I still like the aproach of a symetrical airfoil and then giving it some negative angle of attack &#40;specially on arm 1&#41;. I beleive that was the way it was done with the Pathfinder as well. Why did you leave that approach ?? <BR> <BR>I also saw your modification on the tip of arm 2 on the Highlander MTA. Have you ever tried such a wingtip on an LD-boom ?? Or do you beleive it would only improve the hoovering state of an MTA ?? <BR> <BR>Whoops, seems it became some aimed question to Manuel suddenly. I hope that&#39;s allowed in this forum as well :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Gives me also the opportunity to congratulate you with both the world championships.

 Yes, here are the answers: I try to make an airfoil that doesn&#39;t ask too much tuning. Mostly a negative attack is requested, so I modified the airfoil by removing more material from top.  <BR>Pathfinder made of 3pax had to be tuned every time. Otherwise I only threw ca 100m with that thing!! <BR>I tried this shape at the wingtip of wing 2 but not as extremly as applied on my MTAs. I think I have to do it again. The boom I tried it was made of bad 3gfec so the results were not good enough. <BR>About hovering: It&#39;s not better but small wingtips seem to help stabilizing.

Thanks Manuel, this will give me some directions to experiment with again. <BR> <BR>Hope to see you soon. <BR> <BR>Wrong subject, but have you all seen the whitsun tournament announcement at <BR><A HREF="http://www.etlaare.demon.nl/nl_whitsun.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.etlaare.demon.nl/nl_whitsun.html</A> ???

 So I tried a new LD-boomerang. It seems to do very well. It&#39;s amazingly accurate it always flies straight above my head on the way back, but too high. Should I just add more lead now or are there other recommendations ??

 Depends on the distance it has. If it flies 130 or more, why to change anything? Otherwise you can add weight with a tape and test it. Or make a second boomerang with a more aggressive airfoil &#40;remove more from downside&#41;.

 Well, I want to get further than the 130 meters :-&#41; <BR> <BR>But ok I think with this nice overhead return I&#39;ll leave it the way it is and make a new one &#40;just hope there is some time left the coming weeks&#41;.

 What would you recommend as THE best serious LD boom for someone to start out on? Bear in mind that I&#39;ve been making and throwing other boomerangs for nearly 20 years, so I&#39;m no total newcomer to boomerangs, only to serious LD. <BR>  <BR>Thanks, <BR>Dave
