<a name="eternal"><h1>Gravity and the Eternal Black Hole</h1>
Great, we can do spacetime diagrams of moving objects even if they're
accelerating.  Still, what do we use to describe gravity?  Hmm.  Well, in
1959 two scientists (Pound and Rebke) proved that a gravitational field
behaves just like acceleration.  This is great, we know how to deal with
acceleration!  Are you ready?  Then here's the spacetime diagram of a
black hole:<br><p>

<a name="one"><h1>Region One</h1>
Actually, this is the diagram of an eternal black hole, one that always
has been and always will be; but I will get to that later.  Now, what are
all the parts of the diagram?  There are the light rays, the thick black
lines at 45&#176.  That's the event horizon.  Those blue vertical'ish
parabolas are our friends, the lines of constant distance.  Why must the
lines of constant distance be like parabolas and not straight lines?
Well, to stay in one place in a gravitational field means that you must
have an acceleration equal to the acceleration of gravity.  Also, there
are the green lines of simultaneity. We can recognize these parts from the
diagram for an accelerated object.  We understand region One.
<p>
<a name="two"><h1>Region Two</h1>
What about region Two?  Well, it looks like the picture for constant time,
except---time and space seem to have switched axes!  What gives?  This is
what happens when you cross an event horizon: time and space flip axes.
What does this mean?  Well, light rays still travel at 45&#176.
Unfortunatly, once you cross the event horizon, you would have to travel
with a slope of greater than 45&#176 to recross it and get back into your
universe.  Okay, if you're stuck inside of the event horizon, what's that
singularity thing?  It seem to be everwhere; does that mean you eventually
hit it?  Well, kinda.  Since time and space did a flip around, the
singularity is not an actual spatial distance.  It is, instead, a place in
time.  You will not hit the singularity after falling so many meters, but
you will hit it after falling so many seconds.  That takes care of region
Two.
<p>
<a name="three"><h1>Region Three</h1>
Ah, region Three.  What to do about that.  The funny thing is,
region Three looks just like region One, except it's on the other side of
the black hole's event horizon.  Hmm!  It is a universe in its own right,
but it is not <i>our</i> universe.  We regretfully cannot travel there,
for to do that we would have to travel faster than the speed of light to
recross the event horizon.  What about where the "two" event horizon's
intersect?  To travel that line would involve instantaneous
transportation, which violates the whole
matter-not-being-able-to-move-faster-than-the-speed-of-light concept.
Travellers from the different universes could meet inside the event
horizon, though, for the short time that they survive.
<p>
<a name="four"><h1>Region Four</h1>
I didn't mention region Four.  It is much like region Two with two
important differences.  One: it happened infinitly in the past.  Two: it
appears to have repulsive gravity.  It <i>does</i> in fact have repulsive
gravity.  The singularity in region Four is what astrophysicists like to
call a white hole.  People also call it the Big Bang.  It is a time when
matter is ejected violently from the singularity and shot away with the
repulsive gravity.  Region Four is rather speculative and only
theoretical.  Recall that I said this was a diagram for an eternal black
hole?  Well, most black holes are not eternal.  They form, they exist, and
Hawking would say that they also cease to exist.  Here is the spacetime
diagram for a mortal black hole:<br>
<p>
<a name="mortal"><h1>A Mortal Black Hole</h1>
<img src="../media/mortal.gif"
align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="122" height="200">
What's happening here?  Well, that blue stuff is gas and dust.  You can
see that it is collapsing.  When it collapses to its <a
href="schwarzschild.html">Schwarzschild Radius</a>, an event horizon
forms.  There is a short time (we're talking nanoseconds) after the event
horizon forms when objects falling in can encounter the gas.  After that
time all that is inside the black hole is curved spacetime.  It's rather
odd to think that a black hole is so strong, but there is nothing there
that's doing anything.
