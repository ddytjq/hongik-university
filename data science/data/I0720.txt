<H2>Draw chances</H2>

<p>These are the statistics involving two-leg duels in European cups from 1971/72 
  to 2001/02 (earlier results haven't been taken into account because of different 
  advancing rules). All duels are divided by outcome (home or away team from the 
  first leg progressed) and goal difference (it was totally equal so penalties 
  decided; one team advanced on away goal rule; 1; 2; 3; 4 and more). <br>
<p>&nbsp;
<table width="98%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
  <tr> 
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>penalties</td>
    <td>away goal</td>
    <td>plus 1</td>
    <td>plus 2</td>
    <td>plus 3</td>
    <td>plus 4+</td>
    <td>Total</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>first home advanced</td>
    <td>53 (44%)</td>
    <td>157 (48%)</td>
    <td>522 (44%)</td>
    <td>431 (47%)</td>
    <td>247 (45%)</td>
    <td>506 (44%)</td>
    <td>1916 (45%)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>first away advanced</td>
    <td>67 (56%)</td>
    <td>171 (52%)</td>
    <td>661 (56%)</td>
    <td>480 (53%)</td>
    <td>308 (55%)</td>
    <td>646 (56%)</td>
    <td>2333 (55%)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Conclusion: the team which is home in first of two legs has the less chances 
  for advance (45%), but away goal rule increases them.</p>
