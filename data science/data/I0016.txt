<H2>Founded: 1992</H2>
<P>The FA Premier League was founded in 1992. Its formation allowed the
Football Association to take control of the national championship which had
previously been run by the <A HREF="#nat">Football League</A>, a separate
organisation, and allowed the top clubs autonomy from the lower divisions and a
greater share of TV revenues. Previously the top clubs played in Division One of
The Football League. Since 1993 it has been sponsored by Carling and is known as
the FA Carling Premiership.</P>

<H1><A NAME="nat">Nationwide League</A> (The Football League)</H1>
<H2>Founded: 1888</H2>
<P>The Football League is the oldest league competition in the world and was
the national championship until the formation of the FA Premier League in 1992.
Since then it has been the second tier league of professional football. Since
1996 it has been sponsored by the Nationwide Building Society.</P>
<H3>Founder Members:</H3>
<P>Accrington, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Burnley, Bolton Wanderers, Derby
County, Everton, Notts County, Preston North End, Stoke, West Bromwich Albion,
Wolverhampton Wanderers</P>
<H2>Structure:</H2>
<P>3 divisions, 72 clubs
<BR><A HREF="#nat1">Division One</A> (24 clubs)
<BR><A HREF="#nat2">Division Two</A> (24 clubs)
<BR><A HREF="#nat3">Division Three</A> (24 clubs)
<BR>12 clubs competed in the inaugaral season 1888-9, 11 of which are still
playing in the <A HREF="#prem">Premiership</A> or Football League today. A
second division was added in 1893. Two regional third divisions of 22 associate
clubs were formed in 1920 and 1921 by which time the top two divisions had also
been expanded to 22 clubs. In the early 1950s membership was increased to 92 by
adding two clubs to each regional division. In 1958 the lower two division were
re-organised into Divisions 3 and 4.
<BR> Until 1986 the bottom four clubs in the league had to seek re-election
along with any other clubs which wished to join the League. The vote almost
always went in favour of the clubs seeking re-election and only 5 clubs failed
to be re-elected between 1946 and 1986. After years of lobbying the League
finally agreed to change its rules and from 1987 the champions of the
<A HREF="conf.html">The Conference</A> (the top semi-professional league) have
been promoted to the league in place of the club finishing last. The first club
to benefit from this arrangement were Scarborough. A goal in injury time on the
last day of the season saved Torquay United from being the first club relegated
from the league, instead the &quot;honour&quot; fell to Lincoln City who had
only been relegated from Division Three the previous year. Promotion to the
League is conditional on the Conference champions meeting the League's stadium
and financial criteria. Alarmed by the collapse of Maidstone United in 1992 on
the eve of the new season after only 3 seasons in the League, the League
tightened their requirements and insisted that prospective members must meet
membership criteria by the 31st December prior to joining the League. As a
result no clubs were promoted to the League between 1993 and 1997. Following
unsuccessful court action by the 1997 Conference champions, Stevenage Borough,
the League agreed to relax the deadline for meeting membership criteria to April
30th. There was no reprieve for the bottom club in 1998, Hereford United, and
they were replaced by Conference champions Macclesfield Town. In 1999
Scarborough, the first club promoted from the Conference, became the first club
to be relegated back again. A winning goal 5 minutes into injury by Carlisle
United's on loan goalkeeper in their final game against Plymouth allowed them to
finish a point ahead of Scarborough, who could only draw 1-1 at home with
Peterborough. In March 2000 the Football League agreed in principle to increase
promotion and relegation between the Football League and The Conference to two clubs,
this will expected to come into effect for the 2000-01 season.<BR>
Pressure from the top clubs caused Division One to be reduced
to 20 clubs over two seasons from 1987 with a corresponding increase in Division
Two. This was partially achieved through the introduction of the play-offs.
Division One was re-instated to 22 clubs in 1991 but the play-offs remained.
Divisions Two and Three remained at 24 clubs and Division Three was increased to
23 clubs bringing total membership to a record 93 clubs. This only lasted until
March 1992 when Aldershot collapsed and were expelled from the league.
<BR>At the end of the 1991-92 season the Division One clubs resigned to form
the FA Premier League leaving only 70 clubs in membership. The remaining
divisions were renamed so that the old Division Two became Division One etc.
Membership was increased to 72 in 1995 when the Premiership was reduced to 20
clubs.
