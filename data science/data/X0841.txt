              On April 14, 2002, Paul Tergat and Haile Gebrselassie, the two fastest 
              10,000m runners in history, faced off again at the marathon distance 
              in London, with Khalid Khannouchi's 2:05:42 world record their stated 
              target. Instead, Khannouchi was the spoiler, dropping first the 
              debutant Gebrselassie and then Tergat, the world record holder at 
              half the distance. Closing fast, Khannouchi then shaved four seconds 
              off his own record to become only the second man in history to lower 
              his own world record.</i></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>That's 
              quite a long haul from the young Moroccan who, nine years ago, came 
              to America for the World University Games and didn't go back, washing 
              dishes in Brooklyn and running road races. By 1996 Khannouchi was 
              a dominant road racer; in 1997 he debuted at the marathon distance 
              with a 2:07:10 in Chicago, at the time the third-fastest ever, and 
              the fastest debut. In 1999 he topped that with his 2:05:42.</i></font></p>
            <p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">2000 
              and 2001 were turbulent years for Khannouchi. He struggled through 
              London - his 2:08:36 for 3rd is his personal worst finish - and 
              an even more bruising citizenship fight as he tried to become an 
              American citizen in time to represent the U.S. in Sydney. Injuries 
              aggravated in London prevented him from running the U.S. Trials 
              in Pittsburgh; he came back to run a 2:07:01 American Record in 
              Chicago, winning that race for the third time. In 2001, he ran on 
              the U.S. team for the World Championships marathon in Edmonton, 
              but dropped out.</font></i></p>
            <p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Discouraged, 
              he didn't run a fall marathon, but instead focused on rehabilitating 
              his lingering injuries and building another solid base of training, 
              which paid off in London. Now Khannouchi's impressive marathon record 
              stands at four wins out of seven starts, twice under 2:06, five 
              times under 2:08, two world records, and two American records.</font></i></p>
            <p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Mensracing.com 
              joined the pack of persistent media callers a month after the historic 
              London race, and talked to Khannouchi by phone at his home in Ossining, 
              New York. Khannouchi talked about how he put together a world-record 
              training regimen, how his racing schedule changed as he became a 
              marathoner, and the future of his world and American records.</font></i></p>

              a lot this winter to get ready for London, and that you were training

              <b>Khalid Khannouchi:</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
              Exactly. It's always difficult to find running partners, but I have

              to train with; it's just the fact that they are there with you at 
              the track or on the trails that motivates you to do your best and

              </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I 
              prefer to have four months of training. I think that's good enough

              do the miles that I like to do, I think I would feel confident.</font></p>

              good half-marathons earlier in the fall. Now that you've made a 
              name for yourself as a marathoner, what is it like to go to races 
              at shorter distances? Do you feel like you're expected to be a world-class 
              athlete at all distances, or can you train through? </b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
              The people expect that you're going to go in there and you're going 
              to do well. And sometimes it doesn't work that way. When I was doing 
              one marathon a year, I was able to train hard for short races and 
              do my marathon in the fall, and it was working fine. But when you 
              try to do something difficult -- which is two marathons a year -- 
              it makes it harder, sometimes impossible, to compete over short 
              distances. If you're trying to perform at short distances, you're 
              putting your body in so much stress, and that's why I was getting 
              hurt all the time. I decided not to focus one hundred percent on 
              short distances, but just to make them part of training for my goal, 
              which is the spring or the fall marathon.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>So 
              you were able to separate the races from the ultimate goal, to say 
              you'll run the best you can at the shorter race but to keep that 
              marathon goal in mind.<br>
              </b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yes, 
              exactly. I mean, sometimes I go to races with quality training, 
              and I don't worry about tapering. I just go there with the training 
              that I have in my legs. And it doesn't matter. It's good when you 
              have a good, short, race that you're peaking for, but you cannot 
              peak for all of them.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>You 
              said that you knew you were ready for a good race in London. Do 
              you have benchmark race times, or particular workouts, that show 
              you how your training is coming along?</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              I think it's mostly the workouts. When you do workouts that make 
              you feel good, timewise, the way that you feel, the way that you 
              stride, and the way you manage to do the workout, that gives you 
              an idea. The races sometimes give me an idea, especially when I'm 
              peaking. But this year, going into the London marathon, I felt confident 
              because this is the first year that I had great winter and spring 
              training, and they were injury-free, which really makes a big difference. 
              And that's why I thought I was going to do very well. So I went 
              with hope and faith.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Is

              </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Definitely,

              </font></b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Well, 
              I hope I can do a marathon in the fall, which I hope will be either 
              New York or Chicago. We don't know yet. But I want to go for another 
              marathon, if my body allows me to do it. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I 
              feel that two marathons is the minimum and the maximum that I can 
              do, because you don't want to do too much, you don't want to put 
              your body and your mind in so much stress. But also, you don't want 
              to do just one, because one, you are not going to be competitive 
              at a high level. At least you have to do two, and your body has 
              to adjust with two seasons a year. That's what I'm trying to do. 
              I've been successful marathoning once a year, and I've done well 
              on four occasions, and this time I'm trying to do two good marathons, 
              and I hope that my body will allow it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Do 
              you have races picked out that aren't marathons, for the summer 
              and the fall?<br>
              </b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I 
              haven't picked any races yet, but definitely I will pick out some 
              races. I would say four races, no more than that. I am hoping that 
              I can do short races, especially the half marathon, because that 
              really gives you an idea of where you are, especially when you are 
              in the middle of marathon training. You want to run a half marathon, 
              that really gives you confidence.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>You 
              had a really spectacular half-marathon a couple of years ago in 
              Philadelphia. Do you feel like you can run faster at the half-marathon 
              than you have so far?</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              I think I did the best I could on the three occasions I ran in Philadelphia; 
              I got to win. But my time in 1997 [1:00:27] was really spectacular. 
              I feel that that year I was ready to run 2:06 in my first marathon, 
              it's just I didn't have the experience. But I'll go back to what 
              I said before, the body is fresh, you come in from short races, 
              definitely you will perform very well over a half-marathon. But 
              still, the more you train for a marathon, the more the body gets 
              tired and beat-up. And that's why I'm not trying to push too hard, 
              just do what I can do. Not to set too many goals and try to do a 
              lot.</font></p>

              impossible. But I feel that I can, I don't know, if God helps me, 
              and if we get perfect weather, and everything's perfect, I think 
              I can run faster. But how fast is a very difficult thing to predict.</font></p>

              seven marathons you've really only run three courses, Chicago, London 
              and Edmonton. Given your performances on fast courses in London 
              and Chicago, you don't really have much reason to go anywhere else. 
              But you've also run half-marathons like San Blas, which is by no 
              means a fast course. Do you sometimes race just for the fun of racing, 
              just to go out and be the fastest one on the day?<br>
              </b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yes. 
              I think you don't want to keep putting pressure on yourself to just 
              follow fast times. Sometimes I go to other races just to see. Especially, 
              in the winter season, I like to go to San Blas because that's a 
              race that is really tough. It tells me if I'm weak or if I need 
              better winter training or not. That really tells me where and what 
              I am. I like to go there because that's a hard race. You cannot 
              [always] go to a fast course just because of the stress of chasing 
              times or records. I don't like to do that. Most people think that 
              it's always good to go and break a course record, and so on, but 
              if I get to go there and win, I'll be always happy.</font></p>

              racing a 10,000m on the track?<br>

              Meb wasn't there, he was altitude training at Mammoth. That was 
              too bad. My dream when I started running was to perform on the track. 
              I didn't get a chance. I felt that I had the potential to do very 
              well over 5k and 10k on the track, it doesn't matter that I didn't 
              get the opportunities. But right now, I feel that the road and the 
              track are totally different. Especially for the track, you have 
              to use spikes. I haven't used spikes for more than six years. I 
              don't want to take a chance. And sometimes the people coming from 
              the track try to make transitions to perform on the road, and find 
              it very difficult. I'm not trying to do something impossible. I'm 
              just trying to be realistic and do what I can do, not to over-look 
              and over-set goals. </font></p>

              not something that I worry about. The record is there to be beaten, 
              and everybody can get motivated to go and do that. You know, with 
              the improvement that we've gained over the track and cross country, 
              there's probably somebody that can do it. If Khalid Khannouchi, 
              a human being, can do it, I think anybody else can do it. However, 
              you have to have the will, and you have to have luck, and everything 
              perfect to run better than the time that I ran.</font></p>

              there anybody running now who's likely to reach that level?</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I 
              think so. Maybe Meb, maybe Alan, maybe Abdi. Who knows? The marathon 
              is a different story. You can't take anybody out. It's up to you, 
              and the training, and how mentally strong you are, and if you have 
              a will to do things. I think if a human being can run 2:05, probably 
              another human being can run 2:04. Who knows? </font></p>

              going to make the transition.<br>
              </b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There's 
              no way to predict. If you look at Paul [Tergat], he needs time to 
              make adjustments to perform well over the distance. Gebrselassie's 
              time at 10k could give him 2:04, perhaps, I don't know how fast 
              he can run, but you definitely have to make adjustments. You have 
              to go out there and try the distance, and from there you see if 
              you can really do well or not. I could give you a lot of examples; 
              Hendrick Ramaala runs 59-minute times over the half-marathon distance, 
              but finds trouble running 2:09, 2:10. And some people with 28:20 
              or 28:30 were able to run 2:08. It's something that is up to ability. 
              And people have different bodies.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Do 
              you feel like you're still learning, like you're still adjusting? 
              At age 30, you're still relatively young for the marathon.</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              Yes, I think I'm still learning. Every time you go out there and 
              you experience the marathon you learn something. I learned that 
              you can't trust the distance; I learned that you have to be really 
              patient, both in the marathon and in the training, and I learned 
              that you have to respect everybody because people have the same 
              chance. There was a big example of that in London, people thought 
              that Haile Gebrselassie would win easily, but you know, you just 
              have to respect everybody, and most of all respect the distance. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>Going 
              into London, did you know how good it would be?</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
              Well, I thought that I was able to run 2:06. And I thought that's 
              what we would need to win, I thought probably the winning time would 
              be 2:06. But when we got there, the race was set up for world-record 
              pace, and you had a choice, either to go with the group or run a 
              whole marathon by yourself. And I decided to go with the group, 
              because the pace wasn't too bad for me. But coming from a bad year, 
              coming from dealing with a lot of injuries, I was really happy to 
              be out there, happy to be part of the marathon, and hoped to win. 
              I didn't think about world records. Not at all. But I think to win 
              it, I had to run a world record. When there's the pressure of a 
              world record, it happens to many runners, they don't perform well. 
              But when you go in with less pressure, and you know that you're 
              ready, things can happen. </font></p>

              field. It's as though you perform better when there's a strong field, 
              with big-name contenders. When there are people who can run with 
              you, does that take the pressure off?<br>
              </b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I 
              think that's one reason, but I think that what I find out when I'm 
              training for the marathon is that I can keep up a certain pace for 
              a long period of time. When I find the pace that suits me, I can 
              go with no problems. That happens on many occasions. That's why 
              I've been performing very well, especially in a really good marathon 
              where you have rabbits keeping you in a set pace. The World Championships 
              was an example of a race where we went too slow, and my body really 
              didn't react the way that I wanted. I felt like it wasn't me running,

              step is to make the team. And from there, if you make it you think

              I arrived here in 1993, coming from my country, I knew that I had 
              talent. My dream was to compete over the track, and in the track 
              races hopefully I could be, one day, like all the Moroccan heroes, 
              the champion that got to win a gold medal in the Olympics. I said 
              I have talent, I knew that because I'd been in situations where 
              I had trained with great athletes in Morocco, and that told me that 
              I'm right there. But to be completely honest, I never thought about 
              trying the marathon. And when I decided to go [to Chicago] in 1997, 
              I had a long discussion with my wife. She really thought that I 
              could do very well over the distance, but I wasn't confident. Because 
              to me, the marathon was the ultimate goal. Now, when you're talking 
              about 2002 with all the success that I've had, it's crazy. They 
              say the world is crazy, but that's the reality, I think. I think 
              about all the hard work, and all the support I've had from people, 
              people here have really been so good to me, and because of that 
              I think I had success. But it feels good. If you look at it and 
              you try to analyze all the suffering that I went through, it seems 
              impossible, it feels like a dream. But that's the American dream,
