		In the context of Big Bang cosmology there are a number of &quot;free parameters&quot; that are not fixed by the theory but rather by observations of the universe. Since the CMB radiation was emitted so long ago (and far away), it carries a great deal of information about the properties of our universe which can be measured in no other way. Because MAP will be able to measure the CMB fluctuations with tremendous accuracy across a wide range of angular scales, it should be able to accurately determine most of the basic parameters of cosmology, which will in turn inform the following questions:</p>
	<ul>
      <li>Will the universe expand forever, or will it collapse?      <li>Is the universe dominated by exotic dark matter?
      <li>What is the shape of the universe?
      <li>How and when did the first galaxies form?
      <li>Is the expansion of the universe accelerating rather than   decelerating?
      </ul>
	<p>In order to understand how MAP will determine cosmological parameters, we need to give a little background on the physical evolution of the early universe and describe how cosmologists describe the statistical properties of the microwave background radiation.</p>

<div class="linkstyle1">
<p><span class="hdline3"><b>What MAP Will Record</b></span></p>
      <p>The Big Bang theory implies that the early universe was a hot, dense fluid. During the first three hundred thousand years of the Big Bang, the temperature of the universe exceeded 4000 Kelvin (7000 F), so most of the hydrogen in the universe was <a href="../m_help/h_glossary.html">ionized</a>: the electron of the hydrogen atom was so energized it could not stay bound to the proton. Thus, the early universe was a hot sea of energetic protons and electrons. This hot gas constantly emits, scatters and reabsorbs particles of light called photons and is ultimately the source of the cosmic microwave background radiation. As long as the gas remains ionized, these strong particle interactions tie the photons, electrons and protons together so they behave like a single fluid. As discussed below, this single fluid behavior has implications for how sound waves move through the gas. If we can find a fossil record of those sound waves, we can learn a great deal about the properties of the medium in which they moved and thus learn a great deal about the physical properties of the early universe. To our great fortune, the CMB radiation contains such a fossil record!</p>
      <p>When the temperature of the universe dropped below 4000 K, the electrons and protons were able to combined to make neutral hydrogen. Hydrogen is almost completely transparent to the cosmic background radiation, thus after the universe reached this temperature the photons could propagate freely through the universe. The appearance of the sky on cloudy day is a good analogy to the appearance of the microwave background radiation. Water droplets scatter optical light, much like the free electrons scatter the photons of cosmic background radiation. But water vapor is nearly transparent to optical light, just as neutral hydrogen is nearly transparent to the cosmic background radiation. On a cloudy day, we can look out through the air to the water droplets in the clouds which obscure our view beyond them. <a href="../ContentMedia/990053.jpg" onclick="CSAction(new Array(/*CMP*/'B67777220'));return CSClickReturn();" csclick="B67777220"><img src="../ContentMedia/990053b.jpg" width="427" height="390" border="0" alt="Person looking up through the air to view the underside of a cloud compared to looking through the space to the CMB Surface of Last Scatter"></a><br>
		When MAP observes the microwave background sky it looks back to when there were free electrons that could readily scatter cosmic background radiation. This cosmic background &quot;cloud surface&quot; is called the &quot;surface of last scatter&quot;. If there were any &quot;features&quot; imprinted in this surface of last scatter (i.e.., regions that were brighter or dimmer than average) they will remain imprinted to this day because emitted light travels across the universe largely unimpeded. Thus, observations of the cosmic background radiation directly probe the physical conditions at this epoch, only three hundred thousand years after the Big Bang and one of our ultimate cosmological fossils.<br>
	</p>
      <p><span class="hdline3"><b>Microwave Background Fluctuation Spectrum</b></span></p>
<p>When MAP measures the temperature of the CMB radiation over the full sky, it will will be nearly, but not exactly uniform - there will be variations, or fluctuations, across the sky. There are a number of effects that can produce temperature variations in the microwave background: variations in the density or velocity of the gas at the surface of last scatter (i.e.., sound waves), variations in the gravitational potential of the universe at the surface of last scatter as well as variations in the gravitational potential along the photon path. As we will see, different physical phenomena are responsible for each of these effects so that by studying the microwave background fluctuations, we can infer a wealth of information about the early universe.</p>
      <p>Cosmologists find that it is convenient to represent the fluctuations in terms of an &quot;angular fluctuation spectrum&quot;, which shows the amplitude or strength of temperature fluctuations as a function of angular size (and since the surface of last scatter is a fixed distance away from us, angular size corresponds closely to physical size). Such a plot is shown below for a standard cosmological model. This plot shows a plateau at large angular or length scales then a series of coherent peaks at progressively smaller scales. These features are set up by various physical processes acting on various length scales and they change as one varies the fundamental cosmological parameters.</p>
<p><img height="300" width="450" src="../ContentMedia/basic.gif" alt="Plot for a standard cosmological model. Angular scale vs. temerature fluctuation"></p>
      <p>On the largest length scales the main source of temperature fluctuations are due to variations in the strength of gravity at the time of last scatter. Photons that must climb out of a gravitational potential well will lose some energy and as a result, the radiation reaching us from that direction will appear slightly dimmer or cooler than average, and vice-versa. Since the universe appears to be dominated by some form of <a href="../m_uni/uni_101matter.html">dark matter</a> that has yet to be directly observed the variations in the gravitational potential are largely determined by variations in the density of the dark matter. It is unclear what mechanism established these variations to begin with (remember that the early universe is <i>almost</i> featureless) but many cosmologists believe that a period of <a href="../m_uni/uni_101inflation.html">inflation</a> may have produced the dark matter/gravitational variations a small fraction of a second after the Big Bang. The <a href="http://space.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/cobe/cobe_home.html">COBE</a> satellite first detected fluctuations on these angular scales in 1992.</p>
      <p>As one moves to smaller angular scales (to the right on the plots) one starts to see the imprint of sound waves moving through the ionized hydrogen gas. Recall from above that the photons, electrons and protons behave much like a single fluid before the epoch of last scatter so any regions where the density of protons and electrons are higher than average (a region of compression in a sound wave) will also be a region where the photon density is higher, and vice-versa. When the radiation decouples from the hydrogen gas at the time of last scatter the waves will &quot;freeze out&quot; because the gas has lost its ability to support waves (the photons were providing an important source of pressure or&quot;stiffness&quot;). Thus a region in compression at this time will appear to us as a region that is brighter or hotter than average and vice-versa.</p>
      <p>Most cosmologists believe that sound waves were induced in the hydrogen gas in response to the gravitational fluctuations set up shortly after the Big Bang (perhaps by the episode of inflation). Since these waves have only 300,000 years to live, they can only move or a limited distance (or oscillate a certain number of times) before freezing out. This distance is called the &quot;sonic horizon&quot; and sets a fundamental length scale in the early universe. The first and largest peak in the above spectrum corresponds to sound waves that were just starting their first period of compression when the freeze out occurred. (These are <i>very</i> low frequency sound waves!) The succesive peaks correspond to higher frequency waves alternately caught in periods of rarefaction and compression at the time of last scatter. The relative heights and locations of these peaks contains signatures of the properties of the gas at the time of last scatter.</p>
      <p><span class="hdline3"><b>Measuring the Geometry of the Universe</b></span></p>
      <p>The dominant angular scale for microwave background fluctuations is the angle subtended by the sonic horizon at the surface of last scatter. This distance serves as a ruler for measuring the geometry of the universe. In a flat universe this scale is roughly 1 degree, in our temperature fluctuation spectrum, this corresponds to l = 180. If the universe is open, photons move on more rapidly diverging paths in negatively curved space as shown below. Due to this effect, an object of a given physical size will appear to have a smaller angular size. Thus if the universe were open, the location of the first peak in the fluctuation spectrum would be shifted to smaller angular scales, as indicated below.</p>
      <p><img height="338" width="371" src="../ContentMedia/geometry.gif" alt="The Angle of view or the sonic horizon ia observered to be different depending on the content of the universe"></p>
<p><img height="300" width="450" src="../ContentMedia/open.gif" alt="The amplitude and position of the temperature fluctuations on the graph vary depending on the content of the universe.(Open Universe here)"></p>
<p><span class="hdline3"><b>Counting the Number of Electrons in the Universe</b></span></p>
      <p>The behavior of the early universe fluid will also depend upon the relative number densities of electrons and photons. The more electrons (and protons), the stronger their response to the gravitational potential wells. This leads to an enhancement of the first and third acoustic peaks, which are produced by the fluid falling into the potential wells and a suppression of the second acoustic peak, which is produced by the fluid moving outward. Thus, by measuring the relative heights of the peaks in the fluctuation spectrum, we should be able to determine the relative number density of protons and electrons.</p>
<p><img height="300" width="450" src="../ContentMedia/baryon.gif" alt="The relative hight of fluctuation peaks on the graph determine the relative number density of protons and electrons in the universe."></p>
<p>Increasing the ratio of electrons to photons also has the effect of decreasing the sound speed of the fluid. Since the fluid moves more slowly, the secondary oscillations occur at larger angular scales. This effect shifts the location of the latter peaks in the fluctuation spectrum.</p>
<p><span class="hdline3"><b>Measuring the Matter Content of the Universe</b></span></p>
      <p>The cosmic background radiation propagating from the surface of last scatter to our experiment is also affected by gravitational fluctuations along its path. Photons falling into the gravitational potential wells of clusters gain energy. They lose this energy when they climb out of the potential wells. If the universe is flat and composed entirely of matter, then these two effects cancel exactly and the matter along the photon path has no net gravitational effect.</p>
      <p>If there is a cosmological constant, then the depth of gravitational potential wells decay with time. Thus, a photon which falls into a deep potential well gets to climb out of a slightly shallower well. The net effect leads to a slight increase in photon energy along this path. Another photon which travels through a low density region (which produces a potential &quot;hill&quot;) will lose energy as it gets to descend down a shallower hill than it climbed up. Because of this effect, a model with a cosmological constant will have additional fluctuations on large angular scales. Large angular scale measurements are most sensitive to variations in the gravitational potential at low red shift.</p>

<p>There is a similar effect operating at high red shift (z ~ 500 - 1300): during this epoch, photons and neutrinos make a significant contribution to the total energy density of the universe. Because of this contribution, gravitational potential fluctuations also decay during period. This leads to enhanced fluctuations on angular scales smaller than approximately two degrees. This is the angular scale subtended by the horizon at z ~ 500. The larger the ratio of photon energy density to matter density, the more important role radiation plays during this epoch and the higher amplitude of temperature fluctuations. Since the FIRAS measurements of the spectrum have already determined the photon energy density, we can use the measurement of the amplitude of fluctuations on this angular scale to determine the matter energy density.</p>

<span class="hdline3"><b>Another Window into the Early Universe</b></span></p>
<p>MAP measures not only temperature fluctuations in the microwave background, but also the polarization of the microwave background. While no one has yet detected microwave background polarization, our theoretical models predict that it should exist at an amplitude detectable with MAP's sensitivities.</p>
      <p>Scattered light, whether it is sunlight reflected off of haze, or microwave background photons that are reflected off of free electrons in the early universe is often polarized. This effect occurs because the electron-photon scattering cross-section depends upon the polarization of the incoming photon (which corresponds to the direction of the photon electric field). Because of this effect, we can probe the properties of the electrons that the photon encounters as it propagates from the surface of last scatter to our experiment.</p>
<p>At this point in the discussion, the astute reader might object, &quot;but wait, I thought that there were no free electrons left once the universe cooled below 4000 K&quot;. Fortunately, this is not true. Once stars start forming their radiation will be able to ionize hydrogen, thus liberating free electrons. These free electrons will produce polarization fluctuations in the microwave background that are potentially detectable.</p>
