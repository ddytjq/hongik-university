          terrace classics such as &quot;Everywhere we go&quot;, &quot;England
          my England&quot; and the video &quot;Teargas and tantrums&quot; has
          written a brilliant book from his travels during euro 2000.&nbsp; In
          defiance to the authorities (and the England members club) he set of
          for the low countries with no tickets whatsoever, and ended up inside
          the ground for all three of our group matches.&nbsp; The book is
          written with a lot of knowledge of being a football supporter and also
          with some remarkable humour.&nbsp; Buy this book and find out how Eddy
          Brimson met god (in casual clothes) in Charleroi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b></td>

          in the title, Free Lions is just that, free. An excellent idea and an
          excellent magazine, it can be seen given out at all England matches
          but you have to be quick as they &quot;sell&quot; out fast.&nbsp;
          During euro 2000, the magazine was called &quot;The Lowdown&quot; but
          changed its name after the tournament ended.&nbsp; Our very own half
          time quiz was stolen from them but to my embarrassment, FSA man Kevin
          Miles e-mailed me with a mistake in one of our questions. (oops)&nbsp;
          Look out for this at the next match, it's worth every penny.</font></b></td>

          has a couple of tracks where he explains if the ball went over the
          line and also what happened to the match ball after the game.&nbsp; Altogether there
          are 27 tracks (26 if you discount &quot;Fog On The Tyne&quot; by
          Gazza) and is well worth the £8.99 I paid for it.</font></b></td>

          supporters who were deported for no reason other than being
          English.&nbsp; After the initial jokes and light hearted stories from
          the Portugal match in Eindhoven, the book suddenly becomes very

          supporters sing why they sing them.&nbsp; Almost every English club
          has its own chapter and even a few Scottish/ Northern Irish teams are
          included.&nbsp; For example, did you know that East Fife supporters
          sing &quot;They come from near Lochgelly, They haven't got a telly,
          They're dirty and they're smelly, The Cowden family&quot;?</font></b></td>
