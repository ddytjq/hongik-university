A picture-book of dinosaurs for children and a hefty tome onpaleontology should and must be different. I bring this up because the marketfor Daniel Dennett's new book, <I>Darwin's Dangerous Idea</I>, is, at first, unclear:Is this pop science or a serious attempt to think new thoughts? The questionmatters because the verdict changes with the audience. As a work of popularscience (with a healthy dose of philosophy thrown in), Dennett's book is amodest success. Although he lacks the graceful prose of a Gould or Dawkins,Dennett delivers a thoughtful and provocative book, and many of his readerswill surely dig deeper into evolution as a result. Because Dennett's bookcertainly sports many of the trappings of pop science (e.g., Cute New Names forevery old idea), my review might have ended here, favorably.<br><BR><TABLE><TR> <TD width=300>But Dennett is not in the edutainment business. Near the beginning of his book,he tells us: "I want to play a more direct role in changing what is ignorableby whom. I want to get thinkers in other disciplines to take evolutionarytheory seriously, to show them how they have been underestimating it, and toshow them why they have been listening to the wrong sirens." In short, Dennettwants to talk to the pros. And it is here -- in his attempt to change the wayintellectuals, both scientists and humanists, think about Darwinism -- that hisbook fails.<TD> <TD width=5> <TD align=center valign=center><font size=+2><hr noshade width=75>Dennett does not<br> so much champion <br>adaptationism as<br> excoriate those biologists <br>who dare question it.</font><hr noshade width=75></TABLE>Dennett's thesis is simple enough. He is convinced that intellectualsunderestimate the explanatory power of evolutionary theory, which to Dennettmeans natural selection. He is sure that natural selection is both more potentwithin biology than many biologists believe and more relevant to problemsoutside biology than many social scientists and philosophers pretend. In ananalogy that runs through the book, Dennett likens Darwinism to a "universalacid," an allusion to childhood lore about an acid so corrosive that it eatsthrough everything -- including the jar in which you desperately try to containit. According to Dennett, the universal acid of natural selection can spreadboth <I>downward</I> from biology, explaining the origins of the universe and life,and <I>upward</I> from biology, overturning our views of consciousness, culturalchange, and the origin of morality. The resulting Darwinian Science ofEverything "eats through just about every concept, and leaves in its wake arevolutionized world-view." Dennett takes this Science of Everything idea veryseriously: "The idea of evolution by natural selection unifies the realm oflife, meaning and purpose with the realm of space and time, cause and effect,mechanism and physical law." <p>The bad guys in Dennett's book are those intellectual reactionaries who haveconvinced others that Darwinism can be safely bottled up within biology.Panicked by the spread of scientism, they plead:<p><BLOCKQUOTE>Cede some or all of modern biology to Darwin, perhaps, but hold the line there!Keep Darwinian thinking out of cosmology, out of psychology, out of humanculture, out of ethics, politics, and religion!</BLOCKQUOTE> <p>Dennett is not shy about identifying the obstructionists. Noam Chomsky is aringleader, along with the biologists Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould,and the philosophers John Searle and Jerry Fodor. Remarkably enough, Dennettthinks he has found a common anti-Darwinian sin that binds these men together.In one way or another, Dennett argues, they each invoke a "skyhook" -- amiraculous force or process that gets snuck in the back door to explain someaspect of design in the world, whether a <I>Bauplan</I>, Universal Grammar, or even amoral code. Among pre-Darwinian naturalists, God served as an unusuallyconspicuous skyhook. Why bother with conceiving a natural process that yieldsadaptation when God will do the trick? But bring on the acid: Darwinism teachesus that skyhooks are mythical. Design -- whether manifest in cuttlefish orculture -- is always built from the ground up by natural selection, withoutintervention from any outside superintendent.<p>Sketched like this, Dennett's claims may sound a bit fantastic, the wilddispensations of a barroom know-it-all. They are not. Dennett is anaccomplished philosopher who has thought long and hard about these problems.His arguments are sophisticated and are often fleshed out in erudite detail.And judging from the rave reviews on the jacket-cover, he has won over severalleading evolutionary biologists. Dennett cannot be dismissed lightly.<p>That said, I cannot join in the chorus of praise. Dennett's book suffers from anumber of problems. The most obvious has nothing to do with the soundness ofhis arguments, but with how they are tendered -- the book suffers from anannoying stylistic inconsistency. Although many sections are written in abreezy conversational style, the reader, with an almost audible thud, will plowinto a technical section laden with alien jargon. Similarly, Dennett willintroduce some cute idea that, it seems, will play an important role in hisstory, e.g., the "Cosmic Pyramid." But that ethereal Pyramid is barelymentioned again and the reasons for its invention and debut are frustratinglyunclear. I later discovered one cause of this choppiness: Dennett is not fondof re-working an idea he's once committed to paper. As a result, a ten pagesection from one of his previous publications in, say, the <I>Journal ofAesthetics and Art Criticism</I> will be plopped down nearly verbatim in his book(indeed that particular passage made yet a <I>third</I> appearance in another of hisbooks, <I>Consciousness Explained</I>). A surprising portion of Dennett's bookconsists of snippets from previous papers stapled together. The result is notseamless prose.<p>The book is also marred by factual errors, some scientific and some historical.Population genetic theory, for instance, does not prove that evolution byrandom change is faster than evolution by natural selection, as Dennett claims.And it was Darwin's theory of  sexual, not natural, selection that he called an"awful stretcher." (Darwin branding natural selection a stretcher is about asplausible as Chomsky branding Universal Grammar a real howler.) But these arepeccadilloes and do not touch on Dennett's main claims. Unfortunately, Dennetthas many main claims and we cannot consider them all. I will focus here on two:the notion that natural selection is more powerful within biology thanbiologists often claim; and the notion that Darwinism can diffuse out frombiology, throwing light on the evolution of cultures and the origin ofmorality.<p><B>Adaptationism</B><br>Dennett is deeply troubled by what he sees as assaults on natural selectionwithin biology. He devotes two chapters to defending the view that "Biology isEngineering" -- that organisms are best viewed as machines that have beenoptimally "designed" by natural selection. If correct, this engineering angleis immensely important to biologists as it suggests a research program. Just aswe can sensibly ask about the purpose of any part in a human-engineered machine("Why do cars have spark plugs?"), so we can ask about the purpose of any traitin an organism ("Why do men have nipples?"). According to adaptationism, then,evolutionary biologists are in the business of constructing adaptive storiesabout why organisms are the way they are.<p>But Dennett does not so much champion adaptationism as excoriate thosebiologists who dare question it. His main targets are the Harvard biologists,Gould and Lewontin. In 1979, they published an influential (andstill-controversial) paper in which they argued that adaptationism isflawed.<sup><A HREF = "#2">2</a></sup> Their argument was simple: Although natural selection is animportant force driving evolution, it does not follow that each arbitrarycharacter one can point to has an adaptive purpose. Instead, some features oforganisms are like "spandrels" in ecclesiastical architecture -- the v-shapedspaces formed when two rounded arches meet at a right angle. Although spandrelsare often decked out with mosaics, no one would seriously argue that spandrelsare there <I>because</I> they provide such swell surfaces for mosaics. Instead,spandrels are there because they <I>have to be</I> --  they are, it turns out, aninevitable by-product of putting a dome on rounded arches. Gould and Lewontin'swarning was obvious: Organisms may also sport spandrels. Some traits have noadaptive tale to tell, but reflect structural constraints imposed by anorganism's development or by its quirky evolutionary history.  <p>Consider, for example, the blind spot, a small hole in our visual field. Theblind spot represents the point where the optic nerve -- inside our eye --plunges through the retina on its way to the brain.  The blind spot is amaladaptive legacy of our evolutionary past. Early in vertebrate evolution,light sensitive tissue folded up in such a way that our proto-eye was left withits neuronal wiring <I>on the inside</I>.<sup><A HREF = "#3">3</a></sup> Onceevolution veered off in this direction, a blind spot was a structural inevitability. If the wiringstarts on the inside of the eyeball, some wire somewhere must plunge throughthe back of the eye to reach the brain.  One makes up adaptive stories aboutthe resulting blind spot at some peril.<p>Although many biologists suspect that Gould and Lewontin overstated theirwarning, most would, I think, agree with John Maynard Smith's assessment thattheir paper was "on the whole welcome."<sup><A HREF = "#4">4</a></sup> Alas, such moderatepositions do not come naturally to Dennett. Although he pays lip service to thenotion that any adapted system suffers from "undesigned" features, Dennett ishot under the collar about Gould and Lewontin and their nefarious spandrels.The strange thing is, it's not so obvious why. Why, after all, should a manhoping to export Darwinism from biology be so obsessed with defending theminutiae of adaptive story-telling within biology? I would not think thelegitimacy of, say, cultural Darwinism hangs critically on whether selection isvery important in biological evolution (as everyone, including Gould andLewontin, believe) or is almost exclusively important (as Dennett believes).Cultural Darwinism could be right -- or wrong -- in either case. Dennett,though, seems convinced that he has a big stake in this distinction. <p>Apparently, Dennett sees red whenever adaptationism is questioned because hesuspects a plot to sneak in a skyhook: If you don't like adaptationism,what do you think explains all this biological design? Unfortunately, Dennett'sskyhook-phobia gets the best of him, undermining any hope of a balanced reviewof the powers and perils of adaptationism. His review of attempts by biologiststo circumscribe the role of natural selection is extraordinarily unbalanced.Consider this remarkable omission. Although a full third of his book examineschallenges to evolution by natural selection "that have arisen within biologyitself," Dennett  never once mentions <I>the</I> most serious and famous of allchallenges to selectionist story-telling: the neutral theory. Championed byMotoo Kimura,<sup><A HREF = "#5">5</a></sup> this theory claims that most evolution at themolecular level is <I>not</I> caused by natural selection, but by "genetic drift," therandom replacement of one gene by another, functionally equivalent gene. Ifthis is true, many differences between species have no adaptive significance.The fact that your hemoglobin looks like <I>this</I> and a spider monkey's looks like<I>that</I> reflects chance, not adaptation. <p>Why doesn't Dennett at least acknowledge this enormous challenge toselectionism? One possibility is that he may not know the neutral theory.Kimura -- a mathematical population geneticist -- is a tad harder to read thanthe pop biology Dennett appears to devour. This interpretation is supportedby Dennett's claim that selection can detect any favorable variant, "[h]owevertiny the advantage in question" -- a claim that the neutral theory shows isfalse. But this is probably the harmless hyperbole of a popularizer. And in oneplace Dennett admits that chance replacement of genes can occur, so he hasobviously heard the neutralist song. A more serious possibility is that Dennettis interested only in "real" evolution -- the camel's hump and the elephant'strunk -- and not the evolution of molecules. But this can't be, for Dennettnever tires of telling molecular stories <I>when they're adaptive</I>. Alternatively,Dennett may not want to let the cat out of the bag. Maybe he doesn't want thenaive reader to know that biologists <I>have</I> found a place where the "universalacid" of selection becomes (quite literally) neutral and that many biologistsbelieve that such "non-Darwinian" evolution is common.<p>But I suspect the real explanation is that Dennett is interested in Design (theupper-case "D" is his) and the neutralist/selectionist controversy has nothingto say here. If I am right about this, Dennett fundamentally misunderstandsbiologists' worries about adaptationism. Evolutionists are essentiallyunanimous that, where there is apparent "Design" in organisms, it is caused bynatural selection. Consider the phenomenon of mimicry in butterflies, where atasty species resembles an unpalatable species. Anyone who denies thatselection is at work here simply doesn't know enough about mimicry inbutterflies. But the reason this example goes undisputed is that the design isso terribly obvious. Even if we cannot, at first, fathom the precise cause ofthe remarkable similarity between, say, the monarch and viceroy butterflies, weknow that unrelated species do not look alike by accident.<p>Our problem, as evolutionary biologists, is not a weakness for fictitiousalternative causes of Design. Our problem is that, in many adaptive stories,the protagonist does not show dead-obvious signs of Design. Is it obvious thatthe recessivity of most genetic diseases is adaptive? Evolutionists used tothink so, but we now know they were almost surely wrong. Is it obvious thatflower color differences in plants are adaptive? Many evolutionary biologistshave begged to differ. Is it obvious that most molecular differences betweenspecies need adaptive explanation? The neutralists and selectionists give verydifferent answers. And, last, is it obvious that the neural wiring that allowshuman language evolved as an adaptation <I>for</I> language? Different linguists reachdifferent conclusions. The fact is we often have enormous difficultydistinguishing what is and is not "Designed" -- what does and does not requireits very own adaptive story. <br><TABLE><TR><TD width=5> <TD align=center valign=center><font size=+2><hr noshade width=75>Dennett is quite <br> unclear about <br>precisely how <br>Darwinism <br>transcends biology.</font><hr noshade width=75><TD width=300>If this weren't bad enough, our problem gets exacerbated by a little-noted, butimmensely important, characteristic of our scientific culture: <I>Evolutionarybiologists thrive on creating adaptive stories where Design is least obvious.</I>After all, where is the glory in explaining why some new species of mite isbrown ("it hides in dirt")? The great challenge is to explain why some feature-- whose Design is far from apparent -- is actually adaptive and optimallyDesigned ("this enzyme is more common in the mother than the fetus because . ..").</TABLE>Given our difficulty discerning Design, and this penchant for concoctingadaptive stories just where Design is least conspicuous, how could evolutionarybiologists <I>not</I> have jitters about adaptationism? It would be an extraordinarilyunreflective group indeed that did not ask questions like: How seriously shouldwe take these endless adaptive explanations of features whose alleged Designmay be illusory? Isn't there a difference between those cases where werecognize Design <I>before</I> we understand its cause and those cases where we try tomake Design manifest <I>by</I> concocting a story? And isn't it worrisome that we canmake up adaptive stories (and pen wildly speculative papers) faster than we canmake up experimental tests? Note that there is no mystical talk here ofimagined alternative causes of Design, nor any fatuous Darwin-bashing. There isjust sensible concern about how much adaptationism is too much of a good thing.When does adaptationism stop being a useful research strategy and start being asilly exercise in cleverness? Dennett never confronts these legitimate worries.It is far easier for him to ridicule Gould and Lewontin's rhetorical excesses.<p>I suspect Dennett fails to appreciate these concerns in part because histhinking is guided by a subtly misleading picture of adaptation. Dennett isfond of speaking of selection as leading organisms through "Design Space":Selection "lifts" organisms along "ramps" of good Design. Although this imageryis often useful, it invites two subtle misconceptions about adaptation. Thefirst is that natural selection cares about Design. In reality, selection"sees" only brute birth, death, and reproduction, and knows nothing of Design.Selection -- sheer, cold demographics -- is just as happy to lay waste to thekind of Design we associate with engineering as to build it. Consider the eyesof cave organisms who live in total darkness. If eyes are expensive to make,selection can wreck their exquisite engineering just as surely as it built it.An optic nerve with little or no eye is most assuredly <I>not</I> the sort of designone expects on an engineer's blueprint, but we find it in <I>Gammarus minus</I>.Whether or not this kind of evolution is common, it betrays the fundamentalerror in thinking of selection as trading in the currency of Design. <p>Second, hazy imagery of selection lifting organisms along Design ramps makes ithard to see that selection sometimes moves individual traits <I>down</I> ramps. Butthis surely occurs. The reason is that selection lifts overall "fitness"; it isnot in the business of enhancing the design of isolated traits. Adaptation isbuilt from favorable mutations, but favorable mutations are just geneticchanges that have <I>net</I> good effects. Such mutations needn't have happy effectson every trait they affect. Indeed, this is extremely unlikely. Consequently,adaptive changes may improve traits A and B at the expense of trait C. In aworld of two steps forward and one step back, we  have no reason to expectoptimal Design everywhere. This fact has nothing to do with disreputablenon-Darwinian forces "getting in the way" of adaptation. As evolutionarybiologists have long understood, it <I>is</I> adaptation.<p>In the end, though, this gnashing of teeth over adaptationism is not supremelyimportant to Dennett. Despite devoting a hefty portion of his book to thisproblem, Dennett is not ultimately concerned with how natural selection buildsorganisms. He has much bigger fish to fry.<p><B>Genes, Memes, &amp; Cultural Evolution</B><br>Except to a handful of biologists, there is little "dangerous" in the idea thatBiology is Engineering. There <I>is</I> something dangerous, though, in the idea thatDarwinism transcends biology, undermining our views of culture, consciousness,and morality. Persuading us of this is Dennett's real agenda. Surprisingly,then, he is quite unclear about precisely how Darwinism transcends biology.Sometimes he suggests that Darwin's dangerous idea is that all Design --whether natural or man-made -- is connected by lines of descent. But this isonly trivially true. <I>Of course</I> all of our good ideas (and bad) spring frombrains that sprang from lesser brains back to the primordial ooze. If this isDennett's Big Idea, it is not only an enormous let-down, it is withoutconsequence. One may as well marvel that all our ideas descend from the BigBang. More often, though, Dennett goes whole hog and argues that all Design --the spread of good ideas as well as clever adaptations --  reflects the sameprocess, natural selection. Indeed, Dennett has long championed the notion thatDarwinism might explain why some ideas and styles flourish while othersperish.<sup><A HREF = "#6">6</a></sup> Darwinism thus explains not just the biological <I>origin</I> ofconsciousness and culture, but their changing <I>contents</I>.<p>But this leap from origin to content is extraordinarily problematic. Take, forexample, the humble medium of radio. Its origin is explained by the laws ofelectricity and magnetism: no E&amp;M, no radio. But who thinks that thechanging content of radio -- the Sex Pistols <I>versus</I> Rush Limbaugh -- isdescribed by Maxwell's equations? One does not invoke a "skyhook" when onesays, "The laws of E&amp;M do not go this far." One talks sense.<p>Now Dennett is an able philosopher and this argument is surely not news to him.So why is he ineluctably drawn to the view that cultural change involves somebrand of Darwinism? The reason is that he believes natural selection is an"algorithmic process," a blind, formal procedure whose operation is guaranteedto return a certain kind of result. A defining property of an algorithmicprocess is its "substrate neutrality": An algorithm does a job and returns aresult whatever the input. Dennett concludes that natural selection, as analgorithm, is also substrate neutral. One can select between genes onchromosomes, codes in a computer, or ideas in a culture. As long as mutation,replication, and differential survival occur, any substrate can be selected.For instance, ideas can change (mutate), they can spread (replicate), and somecan die out while others persist (differential survival), so we would seem tohave a substrate suited for selection. Following Dawkins, Dennett claims thatthe substrate that gets selected in cultural evolution is the "meme," anymemorable idea, jingle, or fashion that lasts long enough to get copied byanother person. <p>This substrate neutrality argument is supremely important to Dennett. It -- andnothing else -- explains why selection can be lifted from its historical basein biology. It is what makes Darwinism so dangerous. But Dennett slips here.While it is true that many different kinds of substrate can be selected, it issimply not true that Darwinism works with any substrate, no matter what. IndeedDarwinism can't even explain old-fashioned <I>biological</I> evolution if thehereditary substrate doesn't behave just right. Evolution would quickly grindto a halt, for instance, if inheritance were blending, not particulate. Withblending inheritance, the genetic material from two parents seamlessly blendstogether like different colored paints. With particulate Mendelian inheritance,genes from Mom and Dad remain forever distinct in Junior. This substrateproblem was so acute that turn-of-the-century biologists -- all fans ofblending inheritance -- concluded that Darwinism just can't work. Modernevolutionary genetics was born in 1930 when Sir Ronald Fisher cracked thisproblem: Population genetics shows that particulate Mendelian inheritance savesthe day. It is just the kind of substrate needed for evolution by naturalselection to work.<p>What, then, about Dennett's memes -- all those "tunes, ideas, catch-phrases,clothes-fashions, ways of making pots or of building arches." Do they showparticulate or blending inheritance? Do street fashion and high fashionsegregate like good genes, or do they first mix before replicating in magazinesor storefronts? Does postmodern architecture reflect a blending of themodernist and classical or the inheritance of distinct LeCorbusier andVitruvius genes? I do not know the answers to these questions. And neither doesDennett. And neither does anyone else. <p>But it's worse than this. As Dennett reluctantly admits, memes and genes differin other fundamental ways. Species, once isolated, almost never exchange genes,while exchange between long-isolated cultures is immensely important in thehistory of ideas. Moreover, new ideas -- but not genes -- are produced by asort of directed mutation. Newton did not uncover the Fundamental Theorem ofCalculus by conceiving millions of random ideas. In addition, the fitness ofmemes is strangely tautological. While we can often point to ecological reasonswhy certain genes are fitter than others, a meme is deemed "fit" only becauseit is common. ("Elvis is alive" is certainly a fit meme, but it is neither truenor helpful. It is merely popular.) Last, Dennett confesses that memes oftenshow a <I>Lamarckian</I>, not Darwinian, style of evolution, in that acquired traitsget passed along.<p>Despite Dennett's assurance, then, that "concepts from population geneticstransfer quite smoothly" to "population memetics," it is far from clear thatDarwinism can account for the percolation of ideas, styles, and songs throughculture. In fact, there is a basic problem with any such claim -- we are veryignorant of how humans hold ideas in their heads and of how the ideas in yourhead influence the ideas in my head. So how can we possibly conclude that theprocess "must be" Darwinian? As Searle emphasizes, it is this ignorance of howthings actually work that makes the pretensions of these wild theoriespossible: "Such claims live in the holes of our knowledge."<sup><A HREF = "#7">7</a></sup><p>In light of these problems, how can Dennett be so confident of his Darwinianscience of cultural evolution? Here's the real shocker: He isn't. Halfwaythrough his book, Dennett confides that the "prospects for elaborating arigorous science of memetics are doubtful." But he assures us that, "[w]hetheror not the meme perspective can be turned into science, in its philosophicalguise it has already done more good than harm." I confess that I am astonishedby this move. Without question, the central tenet of Dennett's book is thatDarwinism cannot and should not be confined to biology. As he repeatedlyreminds us, the fact that selection is substrate-neutral allows a downwarddiffusion from biology <I>and</I> an "upward spread of universal acid through humanculture." Indeed: "According to Darwin's dangerous idea, all possibleexplorations of Design Space are connected. Not only all your children and yourchildren's children, but all your brainchildren and your brainchildren'sbrainchildren must grow from the common stock of design elements, genes andmemes . . . . Life and all its glories are thus united under a singleperspective." <p>Or at least this is what Dennett promised us. So what happened? Do we have aDarwinian explanation of our brainchildren or not? Are we left with a scienceof cultural evolution or a vaguely interesting half-analogy between genes andmemes? The answer is clear: Dennett neither describes nor is confident of aDarwinian science of culture. He is in good company; Dawkins backed off hismeme-talk long ago. Indeed his more recent (and very sensible) views on thelimited usefulness of memes should be required reading for all would-becultural Darwinists.<sup><A HREF = "#8">8</a></sup> Although Dennett never quite admits it, hehas also backed off, as can be seen by comparing his 1990 article on "Memes andthe Exploitation of Imagination" (see note 1) and his 1991 book <I>ConsciousnessExplained</I> <sup><A HREF = "#9">9</a></sup> with chapter 12 of <I>Darwin's Dangerous Idea</I>. Although hestill talks up memes <I>ad libitum</I>, he now feels compelled to mention that maybethey're not so much like genes after all and (gulp) maybe they're not evenDarwinian. They just provide a "valuable perspective." Given this denouement,Dennett's habit of ridiculing humanists for their reluctance to face the cold,hard facts of cultural Darwinism is incomprehensible. The fact is there is nosuch science.<p>Dennett also never comes clean about why his hoped-for cultural Darwinismfailed to fly. He would have the naive reader believe that memetics was shotdown by soft-headed humanists ("Darwin-dreaders") who panicked at theencroachment of science. Surely his readers deserve to know that many of themost trenchant criticisms of memetics came from scientists. Dennett's strategyseems clear. When attempting to intimidate humanist opponents, he is fond ofrattling the saber of science. He is allied with the armies of Progress, andhis foes are mushy poets. The problem with this strategy (aside from itsarrogance) is that it assumes there really is some science underlying hisviews. How much more intimidating to swing the club of Darwinian science atone's opponents than to announce that you come armed with a useful"philosophical guise."<p>Given the gulf between his promise of a universal acid and his delivery of ananemic memes-as-a-valuable-perspective, it comes as no surprise that Dennett isa fan of the bait-and-switch strategy. This, he reminds us, is<p><BLOCKQUOTE>[the] practice of attracting customers by advertising something at a bargainprice and then, when you've lured them to the store, trying to sell them asubstitute. Unlike that practice, evolutionary bait-and-switch is not reallynefarious; it just seems to be, because it doesn't explain what at first youthought you wanted explained. It subtly changes the topic.</BLOCKQUOTE><p><B>Evolution and Ethics</B><br>Pervading Dennett's discussion of ethics is a similar confusion about how farDarwinism extends. Here the pattern isn't so much bait-and-switch asbait-and-switch-and-switch. Dennett's argument careens through three stages:<p>1. Early on, we are treated to plenty of hype about how Darwinism undercutsmany of our views of mind and ethics and "illuminates them in ways that haveeluded the traditional approaches, recasting ancient problems and pointing totheir solution." We are also enticed by chapter and section titles like "CanEthics be Naturalized?" and "Redesigning Morality."<p>2. Surprisingly, Dennett then delivers a measured expos&eacute; of the excessesof human sociobiology. Many sociobiologists, he warns, commit the geneticfallacy, wherein one assumes that moral codes appeared "for the benefit of thegenes." Dennett dutifully reminds us that the appearance of culture radicallyalters the rules of the game -- once memes arrive, they can call the shots.Indeed, people, "as a result of interactions between their meme-infestedbrains, are not at all bound to answer to the interests of their genesalone."<p>3. But Dennett suddenly lurches back to Darwin, asserting that, while culturerenders the world more complex than many sociobiologists pretend, thismeans only that we must perform "a more careful inquiry" into the origins ofmorality. And what does this more careful inquiry look like? One thing iscertain: It is genetic. Indeed it looks a lot like textbook sociobiology.Dennett explains that a "vivid way of posing the question is to imaginebecoming an <I>artificial</I> selector of altruistic people" (his emphasis). But sinceGod appears not to have performed this experiment for us, we must explain "theevolution of ethics by <I>natural</I> selection" (his emphasis). This occurs via theusual sociobiological steps. Building on care of progeny, selection encouragesan investment in other relatives (so-called "kin selection"). Nothingcontroversial so far. But this must be followed by the far more difficult taskof extending the moral circle to include all, kin or not. ("Thou shalt notkill" says nothing about relatedness.) Fortunately, a genetic theory of"reciprocal altruism" shows how such behavior can, in fact, evolve by naturalselection. <p>It is probably unfair to brand this zig-zagging, "It's all Darwin . . . it'sall culture . . ." argument bait-and-switch. I suspect that Dennett isgenuinely unsure where to plant his feet. After passionately arguing that thememes of culture can snap the leash of genetic control, why abruptly argue thatmorality evolved via selection of genes? <p>I should make it clear that I am not troubled by the possibility that yourcivility (as well as mine) reflects ancient genetic changes. It may well. Butthe notion that the diffusion of morality among humans <I>must</I> have involvednatural selection is absurd. Imagine, for instance, that evolution blessed ourhirsute ancestors with consciousness and language. But, alas, these immoralbrutes -- who are kind only to their families -- have run out of geneticvariation and, thus, no further evolutionary change is possible. What reason isthere to think that social contracts, cooperation among hunters, and the otheringredients of an <I>Ur</I>-morality couldn't catch on among these thinking, speakingbeasts? None as far as I can see. Is it obvious that genetic changes arerequired for such a thing? Where are Dennett's trusty memes when we needthem?<p>The deeper point, though, is that this navel-gazing -- these endless attemptsto theoretically reconstruct what "must have" occurred during the emergence ofhuman morality -- is no more than academic exercise. The ugly fact is that wehaven't a shred of evidence that morality in humans did or did not evolve bynatural selection. We do not even know what such evidence would look like. Wecan, if we like, construct plausible adaptive scenarios ("What would happen toa gene that said be nice to strangers if . . ."). But, in the end, a thoughtexperiment is not an experiment. We have no data.<p>Dennett's treatment of evolutionary ethics is symptomatic of the problemplaguing his entire book. He is forever suggesting that the universal acid ofnatural selection <I>may</I> be involved here or there. Natural selection ofalternative universes may explain why we live in a world having just thesephysical constants (I spared you this one). Selection may explain the rise andfall of ideas and songs. Selection may explain why "strong" artificialintelligence is destined to work (nature got semantics out of syntax, sodigital computers can too). Selection may explain the spread of ethical codesamong humans. But at each milepost the skeptical reader grumbles, "But maybenot." After all, the evidence for each claim ranges from non-existent(alternative universes, origin of morality) to negative (Darwinian evolution ofmemes). All Dennett really shows is that -- if one squints hard enough -- onecan <I>sort of</I> see how Darwin's dangerous idea <I>might</I> play a role in this, that, orthe other. Although he has produced a provocative and intermittentlyentertaining book, Dennett's chief claim is unconvincing. Darwinism may havelittle to tell us outside of biology.<p>Dennett, ever optimistic, triumphantly concludes that "[t]here is no denying,at this point, that Darwin's idea is a universal solvent, capable of cuttingright to the heart of everything in sight." Drawing his argument to a close, hequotes, with some approval, Nietzsche's bleak vision of a Nature ruled by anapathetic but omnipresent Darwinism:<p><BLOCKQUOTE>"According to nature" you want to <I>live</I>? O you noble Stoics, whatdeceptive words these are! Imagine a being like nature, wasteful beyondmeasure, indifferent beyond measure, without purposes and consideration,without any mercy and justice, fertile and desolate and uncertain at the sametime; imagine indifference itself as a power --  how <I>could</I> you live accordingto this indifference!<sup><A HREF = "#10">10</a></sup></BLOCKQUOTE><p><b></b>But Nietzsche's real message about the Stoics -- which I suspectDennett would rather you not hear -- is very different. It is, however,surprisingly relevant. In the next paragraph Nietzsche reverses himself:<p><BLOCKQUOTE>In truth, the matter is altogether different: while you pretend rapturously toread the canon of your law in nature, you want something opposite, you strangeactors and self-deceivers! Your pride wants to impose your morality, your idealon nature --  even on nature --  and incorporate them in her; you demand thatshe should be nature "according to the Stoa" . . . . For all your love oftruth, you have forced yourself so long, so persistently, sorigidly-hypnotically to see nature the wrong way, namely Stoically, that youare no longer able to see her differently . . . . But this is an ancient,eternal story: what formerly happened to the Stoics still happens today, too,as soon as any philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always createsthe world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise.<sup><A HREF = "#11">11</a></sup></BLOCKQUOTE><p>It is perhaps understandable why Dennett -- so fond of creating Darwinianworlds of cosmology, culture, and mind -- chose not to quote the entirepassage.  <p><hr width=50%><P><A NAME=1><SUP>1</SUP></A><I>The Riddle of the Universe at the Close of the Nineteenth Century</I> (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1901).</P><P><A NAME=2><SUP>2</SUP></A>Stephen J.
