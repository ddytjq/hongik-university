Okay, I won't be able to explain every little mathematical detail about
spacetime diagrams; but I will explain how to evaluate them visually.
This way you can understand the spacetime diagrams on this page.  I should
warn you about the axes.  This is not the standard x-y crosshair.  For
spacetime diagrams the y-axis (the vertical one) represents time.  The
x-axis (the horizontal one) represents space.  This is a 1-1 diagram,
which means there is only one time dimension (which we are used to) and
one space dimension (which we are not).  We're used to living and moving
in three spatial dimensions.  What does 1D space look like?  It's like
living on a line: all you can do is go forward or go backward.  That's it.

No left, right, up, or down.  That's what these spacetime diagrams
describe, 1 time dimension and 1 space dimension.  Why only 1?  To
represent two spatial dimensions would require a three dimensional graph,
which are tough to draw.  To represent three spatial dimensions would
require a four dimensional graph, which would probably have to be some
kind of animated thing and even more difficult to draw.
I will attempt to explain this stuff with the help of Lupin, my cockatiel.
See this picture on the right?  That's him, fluffing up.

<a name="me"><h1>Take a look at this diagram:</h1><br>
<img src="../media/meinert.gif"
align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="168" height="175"> There are
black lines, red lines, and blue lines.  Those thick vertical'ish lines
are called worldlines.  The black one describes what I'm doing and the
blue one describes what my bird, <a href="http://www.dragonweave.com/gothos/html/lupin.html">Lupin</a>, is doing.
In this diagram Lupin sits still for a while, flies towards me, flies away
from me and back to his previous position, and stays there.  I just stay
in one place.  So, you know what those thick lines are, but what about the
thin ones?  Those are lines of simultaneity.  Those are lines of constant
time.  You know, 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds.  Those red lines?
They're light rays.  Light rays are alway drawn at 45&#176.  Anything with
matter cannot realistically have a worldline with a slope equal to or
greater than 45&#176 because matter cannot go the speed of light (and
nothing can go faster than light).
<p>
So far things seem simple.  Then again, maybe not.  There are two sets of
thin lines, mine and Lupin's.  Things that are simultaneous are
simultaneous, you say.  Well...not quite.  If you are standing still
(which is tricky), your lines of simultaneity are horizontal.  If you are
moving your lines of simultaneity tilt.  The angle between your worldline
and a light ray is the same angle between the light ray and your line of
simultaneity.  The faster you go, the more those lines of simultaneity
tilt from strictly horizontal. Confused? That's okay, <a
href="drawing.html">here's</a> an additional section on lines of
simultaneity.

Lupin:</h1><br>

Okay, there is an important concept in drawing spacetime diagrams: the
inertial reference frame.  You'll notice that the same incident can be
drawn differently, depending on what everything is drawn relative to.
Which one of these two diagrams is the right one?  Both.  They are both
accurate representations of what happened.  In my eyes Lupin flew towards
and then away from me.  I thought I was standing still.  In Lupin's eyes
he was standing still and I moved towards and then away from him.  Whoever
the diagram is drawn with respect to must have a straight and vertical
worldline.
