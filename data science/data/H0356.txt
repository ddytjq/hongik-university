An overview ofthe function of the eye:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Light enters the pupil, is focusedand inverted by the cornea and lens, and is projected onto theback of the eye. At the back of the eye lies the retina, sevenlayers of alternating cells and processes which convert a lightsignal into a neural signal (&quot;signal transduction&quot;).The actual photoreceptors are the <B>rods</B> and <B>cones</B>,but the cells that transmit to the brain are the <B>ganglion cells</B>.The axons of these ganglion cells make up the optic nerve, thesingle route by which information leaves the eye.</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="eye1.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=#FF00FF FACE="Palatino">B. Structures atthe anterior pole of the eye:<BR></FONT></B><P><CENTER><TABLE ><TR><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><IMG SRC="eye2.gif"></CENTER></TD><TD WIDTH=252><I><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Moving parts of the eye:</FONT></I><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">1. The iris is really a shutter that can be closed down to regulate the amount of light entering the eye. This process is controlled by two muscles with distinct innervation:</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">- the <B>pupillary sphincter</B> muscle constricts the pupil like a purse-string, and is under the control of the parasympathetic system. Therefore it is innervated by fibers from the oculomotor nerve which originate in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus of the midbrain. </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">- the <B>pupillary dilator</B> muscle is composed of radial fibers which pull the pupil open, and is controlled by the sympathetic system. Therefore it is innervated by post-ganglionic sympathetics from the superior cervical ganglion. Remember that the pre-ganglionics come from T1.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">2. The lens is a naturally elasticstructure. If it had its way, it would round up into a more sphericalshape. Under normal conditions, however, an array of radial fibers- the <B>zonule fibers</B> - hold the lens stretched out intoa more disc-like shape. This shape allows for far-focusing. Whathappens when you need to near-focus? At this point the <B>ciliarybody</B>, a hoop-like structure that supports the zonule fibers,comes into play. Imagine a spiderweb built into the opening ofa drawstring purse, suspending a disk in the opening. When thepurse is open, the spiderweb is taut. If you pull the drawstring,however, the web will go slack and collapse on itself. The ciliarybody is the drawstring purse, in this analogy. The <B>ciliarymuscle</B> within it is the drawstring. When the ciliary musclecontracts (this is also under parasympathetic control), the zonulefibers go slack, the suspended lens is released from their tension,and it is free to round up. This change is necessary for near-focusing.The entire process of adjusting the focus to different distancesis called <B>accommodation</B>. <BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=#FF00FF FACE="Palatino">C. The retina:<BR></FONT></B><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="eye3.gif"></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The retina is a seven-layered structureinvolved in signal transduction. In general, dark "nuclear"or "cell" layers contain cell bodies, while pale "plexiform"layers contain axons and dendrites. </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Trace the signal through the retina:<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">- Light enters from the GCL sidefirst, and must penetrate all cell types before reaching the rodsand cones.<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">- The outer segments of the rodsand cones transduce the light and send the signal through thecell bodies of the ONL and out to their axons.<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">- In the OPL photoreceptor axonscontact the dendrites of bipolar cells and horizontal cells. Horizontalcells are interneurons which aid in signal processing.<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">- The bipolar cells in the INL processinput from photoreceptors and horizontal cells, and transmit thesignal to their axons.<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">- In the IPL, bipolar axons contactganglion cell dendrites and amacrine cells, another class of interneurons.<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">- The ganglion cells of the GCL sendtheir axons through the OFL to the optic disk to make up the opticnerve. They travel all the way to the lateral geniculate nucleus.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=#FF00FF FACE="Palatino">D. Specializationsof the retina:</FONT></B><P><CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD WIDTH=252><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The <B>fovea</B> defines the center of the retina, and is the region of highest visual acuity. The fovea is directed towards whatever object you wish to study most closely - this sentence, at the moment. In the fovea there are almost exclusively cones, and they are at their highest density.</FONT></TD><TD WIDTH=252><B><IMG SRC="eye4.gif"></B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2 WIDTH=504><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The ratio of ganglion cells : photoreceptors is about 2 :1 here, the highest in the eye. In addition, at the fovea all of the other cell types squeeze out of the way to allow the most light to hit the cones. This makes the fovea visible microscopically. The blood vessels also skirt a wide margin around the fovea. The area in and around the fovea has a pale yellow pigmentation that is visible through an ophthalmoscope, and is called the <B>macula</B>.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The ganglion cell axons all leavethe eyeball at one location, the <B>optic disk</B>. At the opticdisk all photoreceptors and accessory cells are pushed aside sothe axons can penetrate the choroid and the sclera. This createsa hole in our vision, the blind spot. Normally each eye coversfor the blind spot of the other, and the brain fills in missinginformation with whatever pattern surrounds the hole. Thereforewe are not conscious of the blind spot. <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Photoreceptors are not distributedevenly throughout the retina. Most cones lie in the fovea, whereasperipheral vision is dominated by rods. Overall, rods greatlyoutnumber cones. Review the characteristics of rods (black andwhite vision, very sensitive to low light) and cones (color vision,not so sensitive) and explain these phenomena:<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">1. To see a faint star, you cannotlook directly at it, but must look slightly to the side.<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">2. A person with macular degenerationcan become functionally blind, yet their night vision is not reallyaffected. How would their color perception be?<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=#FF00FF FACE="Palatino">E. Interesting anatomicalfacts:<BR></FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">- The <B>cornea</B> is continuouswith the <B>sclera</B>, which in turn is continuous with the <B>dura</B>.<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">- The <B>choroid</B>, a highly vascular,highly pigmented layer between the sclera and the retina, is continuouswith the ciliary body and the iris. Do not confuse it with thepigment epithelium.<BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">- The <B>pigment epithelium</B> isa single cell layer thick, and comes from the outer layer of theoriginal <B>optic cup</B> (a classic embryological "pushed-inball"). In the mature retina it is pushed directly up nextto the neural retina, which came from the inner layer of the opticcup. They are not fused together, however, and can separate alongthe old plane - a "separated" or "detached"retina. <BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=#FF00FF FACE="Palatino">F. Signal processingin the retina - the center-surround receptive field.</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">If you were to record from a photoreceptor,you would find that it was "ON" (hyperpolarized, paradoxically)whenever light shone on it. If you recorded from a ganglion cellinstead, you would find that diffuse light did little to the cell.However, the cell would respond well to a small spot of light,a small ring of light, or a light-dark edge. We say that thiscell has a <B>center-surround receptive field</B> - the centermust be mainly light and the surround mainly dark, or vice versa.What happens between the outer segment and the ganglion cell?This complex receptive field is created by the interneurons ofthe retina: the bipolar cells and the horizontal cells, primarily.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Let's trace a signal through:<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><TABLE ><TR><TD WIDTH=252><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">1. Light hyperpolarizes the cone (or rod). For simplicity's sake, we will just say that turns ON the cone, and thereby excites the bipolar cell directly underneath. That bipolar cell then excites its ganglion cell. </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The same thing is happening to neighbor cells.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">2. However, here's the trick. The neighbor cones also excite horizontal cells. The horizontal cells send processes laterally and inhibit the center bipolar cell. </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">So, what does diffuse light do? It excites the central bipolar cell, but also inhibits it via the neighbors. Result - the ganglion cell does not get excited. It continues to tick along at its normal, tonic rate.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">3. A small spot of light, however, excites the bipolar cell but not its neighbors. There is no inhibition, so it is free to get really excited and excite the ganglion cell, which fires like crazy.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">4. A ring of light excites only the neighbors. Now, the bipolar cell is strongly inhibited, with no excitation. In response to this strong silencing of the bipolar cell, the ganglion cell shuts down as well. It will not turn on again until the light is turned off, at which time you will see a rebound "off-response".<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">This is an ON-center cell. </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The reverse of this entire scenario can be created by reversing all the signals (which we can do with different receptors to the same neurotransmitter) - you then have an OFF-center cell.</FONT></TD><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><IMG SRC="eye5.gif"></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">This unique center-surround receptivefield is also a property of lateral geniculate neurons. Thingsget even more complicated up in the cortex.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">What is the point? Well, our entirevisual system exists to see borders and contours. We see the worldas a pattern of lines, even things as complex as a face. We judgecolors and brightness by comparison, not by any absolute scale.(Don't believe it? Put that teal scarf next to a blue shirt, you'llcall it green. On a green coat, you'll call it blue.) This systemof lateral inhibition in the retina is the first step towardssharpening contours and picking up on borders between light anddark. Diffuse light is ignored by the ganglion cell, but a sharpdot will really turn it on. Higher up in the cortex, all thesedots will be combined into lines, which will be combined intocurves, etc, etc.<BR><BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=#0000FF FACE="Palatino"><A HREF="http://thalamus.wustl.edu/course">RETURN TO HOME PAGE</A><BR></FONT></B></BODY></HTML>
