Control Events</H2>

Programming for a GUI (Graphical User Interface) is not as straight forward as programming a normal sequential program <I>i.e.</I> one that starts with the first line of code runs throught every other line of code in sequence and finishes with the last line of code. Programming in a GUI introduces a random element....<I><B>the USER!</B></I>. 
<P>
The user can go anywhere and do anything
Each custom control is also associated with a set of events. The most obvious is the click event assocaited with a button. Instructions can be associated with different events
