    <td><font SIZE="2">Right. First of all this was an important event. Not only did the
    Chester Independent Supporters Association bring 65 people with them, but their MP,
    Christine Russell, managed to assemble a very imposing array of movers and shakers to
    listen and to talk with us.<p>Those attending, most of them for the whole 90 minutes which
    we spent in Westminster were:<ul>
      <li>Christine Russell MP for Chester</li>
      <li>Tom Pendry MP, and chair of the Football Trust</li>
      <li>Ivor Caplin MP, Brighton</li>
      <li>Steve Pound MP ealing North</li>
      <li>Philip Chamberlain, PA to Tony Banks</li>
      <li>Jo Ashton MP and chair of the All Party Football Group</li>
      <li>Lord Dorman</li>
      <li>Peter Pike MP, Burnley</li>
      <li>Dave Watts MP, St Helens</li>
      <li>Andrew Mellor MP, Ellesmere Port</li>
      <li>Joan Walley MP, Stoke North</li>
      <li>Jane Kennedy MP, Wavertree</li>
      <li>Bob Russell MP, Colchester</li>
      <li>Tony Banks MP, Minister for Sport</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tony Banks was a busy man and was said to have only 5 minutes available. In the event
    he stayed for 45 minutes and missed another meeting he was supposed to attend. he had also
    just come back from the dentist! He was a VERY passionate man about football and what is
    happening to it. <img src="../images/chester_petition.jpg" width="140" height="240"
    alt="chester_petition.jpg (9231 bytes)" align="right" border="0"></p>
    <p>Ivor Caplin started by saying that the game is changing dramatically and that is it is
    vital supporters have their say in what those changes should be. He believes that
    supporters, united, are a VERY powerful body of people and used Brighton &amp; Hove Albion
    to illustrate the point. He urged all supporters to speak with one voice. he also said
    that, for him, football is about a league of 92 clubs - NOT a Premiership and also rans.
    Peter Pike supported this view strongly. Caplin is opposed to the Premier League and all
    its works.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><em>(Right, Chester City ISA Chairman Mark Howell hands over the Evening Leader
        5000+name petition to Chris Hill from the Football League.)</em></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Jo Ashton then spoke. He is a dogmatic and opinionated man, but he did, mostly, talk
    sense. He believes that football generally has a serious problem. He mentioned Hull and
    Doncaster Rovers as two current examples. Just last night he had had a meeting with BSkyB
    and the premier League about the Man Utd takeover. He was very blunt. He told us that he
    could see the &quot;greed and the pounds signs in their eyes&quot;. He believes that
    people like BSkyB and co MUST have sympathy with lower league clubs since if say a Murdoch
    Man Utd were playing on TV one night it would cripple the attendance at lower league
    matches. He laboured this point. </p>
    <p>Ashton believes there MUST be a regulator for football. The old leveller of performance
    that used to ensure survival of all clubs he believes was the maximum wage and the 25%
    share of away gate money. Both these have now gone and there is no leveller in place. This
    is a brave omission he felt which, with the advent of plc's means that big clubs will, if
    allowed to go unchecked, kill smaller clubs off. Even the FA, he said, wanted no one to be
    able to own more than 10% of ANY club. </p>
    <p>In Jo's view, the bottom line of the accounts of a football club is NOT all important -
    but that the greed he sees will continue until there is a regulator. He kept making this
    point over and over again. He said that the problems in football ARE being examined at
    great length in the corridors of power, and that, in his opinion, the WHOLE structure of
    football needs to re-organised. A few Ashton quotes:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>&quot;Sheer 100% capitalist greed today&quot;</em></p>
      <p><em>&quot;The FA can't even agree on Youth games&quot;</em></p>
      <p><em>&quot;football is badly run and badly handled&quot;</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Tony Banks then took over. What a speaker! What passion! What commitment! Even the Tory
    Colchester MP spoke very warmly about our Tony and said that in Tony there is a Sports
    Minister who not only cares and listens but who is willing to do! </p>
    <p>Tony thinks that the appointment of a regulator is a difficult issue. </p>
    <p>The power to run football today does NOT lie with government - or parliament. But, he
    also said that Parliament might end up having to take decisions on the regulatory
    requirements of football generally. He also believes that there is a whole series of
    haphazard events and changes impacting upon football in particular and sport generally
    which no one at present can either influence or control. Therefore, the idea of the
    regulator might be one whose time has come. It has been talked about in the corridors of
    power for quite a long time now - particularly as supporters have been slipping further
    and further away from having any influence. </p>
    <p>He believes that it is now only Parliament which listens to them. (Wow!!) He said, and
    I quote,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>&quot;If forces and influences are affecting football seriously then government
      would have to act&quot;. </em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>That is a VERY clear statement of intent and a warning to the FA and their associated
    lackeys. Tony recognised that there is whole list of football clubs on the brink. He also
    recognises that football clubs are very important indeed to local communities. They give a
    sense of identity and pride. Therefore, small clubs need protection from the forces
    affecting them. </p>
    <p>At one point I couldn't restrain myself from shouting out <em>&quot;Hear! Hear!&quot;</em>
    when Tony said that the FA MUST look into the bona fides of football club owners. Jo
    Ashton had mentioned that this bloke Hinchcliffe who has taken over a directors chair at
    Hull this week is banned by the DTI from serving as a company director for 7 years - yet
    the FA either cannot or will not do anything about it. Tony seized on this point and made
    another very clear statement of intent. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>&quot;The FA MUST do something about the credibility of owners.&quot;</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Other points of interest: the FA apparently will NOT allow Phoenix clubs to take over
    the name and/or league status of a club that has gone broke. </p>
    <p>Lots of chat about raising money with which to pay for the top legal, marketing and
    business advice which any one fighting for their club MUST do. Lots of offers of contacts
    via the all party football group in the House. </p>
    <p>A fascinating day - and a very profitable one. There is no doubt that these powerful
    people are seriously concerned and that they have the will to actually do something. Now
    we must back them to the hilt most vociferously.</font></td>
