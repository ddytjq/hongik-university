WOMEN'S ISSUES AND CONCERNS</FONT><BR>
<FONT FACE="verdana,helvetica" SIZE="-1" COLOR="darkgreen">
<I>INJURIES, PREVENTION, FAT VS LEAN</I></B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="verdana,helvetica" SIZE="-1">
<B>THE DESIGN</B><BR>
1. Compared to males, the female skeletal design is generally smaller at the wrist, knees, shoulders, and ankle joints, thus increasing overall injury potential.<BR>
2. Women have a greater "Q" angle which is the width of the hips in relationship to the knee joint. A large "Q" angle  increases the susceptibility to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) damage.  Medical surgeons have often noted that females have a smaller condylar notch through which the ACL passes. Because of the small space, the ACL is more prone to friction increasing potential damage.<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/ladytraining.gif" WIDTH="83 HIGHT="200" ALIGN="left" ALT="Lady training">
3. Females often have hyper-mobile joints particularly at the elbow and knee joints. Extra caution must be used in performing arm curls, tricep extension, and squats in the weight room.<BR>
4. Studies indicate that during running, jumping, throwing, and lifting movements, females activate the quadriceps muscles prior to the hamstring . This timing  imbalance places a large sheer force on the knee joint.<BR>
5. In power movements such as running and jumping, females generate muscular forces slower than males.
<P>
<B>PREVENTION</B><BR>
<I>Step 1:</I> Restore flexibility to muscles that are restricting or altering joint mobility.<BR>
<I>Step 2:</I> Incorporate exercises and drills that strengthens core stability (trunk strength) and hip regions.  The core/hip area is the epicenter of the body in which multiple  forces generate. Without a strong core area the integrity of the spine and outer limbs (shoulders, legs, and arms) is compromised.<BR>
<I>Step 3:</I> Incorporate free weights and functional strength exercises. The use of 
free weights will activate up to 90% of the body's muscles vs machine weights which activates up to 50%.<BR>
<I>Step 4:</I> Incorporate  swiss ball, medicine ball, and bio-foam training. These tools will help strengthen proprioceptors which are small receptors located in the tendons and ligaments of the body and are responsible  for detecting joint loads.  Proprioceptors communicate with the brain without conscious thought . Research indicates that training for the unconscious  movement will decrease the risk of injury.<BR>
<I>Step 5:</I> Incorporate backward running, skipping drills, shuffle drills, and  lateral/rotational agility movements to educate the hamstring muscles to produce forces more efficiently and improve reactionary muscle forces necessary for power and speed movements.
<P>
<B>FAT VS LEAN MUSCLE</B><BR>
Women lose approximately 5 pounds of muscle per decade prior to menopause. During the post menopause years that number increases to 10 pounds per decade. That statistic can drastically be reduced and possibly stopped with the incorporation of proper eating patterns and  exercises.<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/ladymuscleblue.gif" WIDTH="79 HIGHT="101" ALIGN="right" ALT="Lady body">
<I><B>1. Promote Metabolic Boost</B></I><BR>
According to Australian researcher Robbie Parker, a woman's body uses 40% less energy than a man while exercising in similar movement patterns. A woman's body was designed to carry a fetus for 9 months; because of that, when a woman starts a diet her body detects a starvation mode and attempts to protect itself by slowing down the
metabolism and storing fat. This starvation mode leads to loss of lean muscle, increase of fat retaining enzymes, and decrease fat reducing enzymes. In her book "Outsmarting the Female Fat Cell" Debra Waterhouse states you have outsmart the body by eating light meals throughout the day and exercising on a consistent basis. Thus, giving a boost to the metabolism.<BR> 
<I><B>2. Aerobic vs Anaerobic</B></I><BR>
Aerobic exercises and patterns include 20 or minutes of continuous movements such as jogging, cycling, walking, aerobic classes etc... Aerobic exercises are low intensity exercises.<BR>
Anaerobic exercises include strength training, sprints, intervals, boxing, kick-boxing etc... Anaerobic exercises are moderate to high intensity exercises.<BR>
<B><I>3. Keep the Exercises Lipolytic (fat burning)</I></B><BR>
For every pound of muscle created by anaerobic exercises you will expend an additional 30-40 calories per day while sitting idle. A group study indicated that during a 60 minute session of anaerobic vs aerobic training the anaerobic group burned 650 calories and the aerobic group burned 210 calories. In that same study  2 hours after training while sitting idle, the anaerobic group had used 250
calories vs 25 expended calories for the aerobic group. Equipment such as barbells, dumbbells, medicine balls, and swiss balls when used properly will use 90% of the body's muscle pool vs machine weights that use only 25%-50%.<BR>
The choice is obvious, if you want to maximize your fat burning potential incorporate a good strength training program using free weights in conjunction with medicine balls and swiss balls.<BR>
<B><I>4. Should I Ever do Aerobic or Cardio. Training?</I></B><BR>
The answer is yes, but timing is everything. The most productive time for you to perform cardio/aerobic training is post strength training session or first thing in the morning. Following a strength workout glycogen stores are low and a 20-30 minute cardio./aerobic session will more easily tap into fat stores. In addition, performing aerobic training in the morning on an empty stomach will promote fat loss due low glycogen stores as a result of over night fasting.<BR>
<IMG SRC="images/ladyboxer.gif" WIDTH="98 HIGHT="200" ALIGN="left" ALT="Lady boxer">
<B><I>5. Hormone Production</I></B><BR>
Growth Hormone production by the body will promote lipolysis(fat burning), lower blood pressure, and improve immune system. Epinephrine and nor-epinephrine are 2 hormones that when produced will inhibit the release of insulin.. When insulin is produced it pushes fatty acids back into fat cells. In other words insulin will
cause your body to hold onto fat. Compound movements  such as squats, lunges, dead lifts, and squat presses are the optimal exercises to stimulate the release of
growth hormones. In addition, performing 10-20 reps per set, 30-60 second rest intervals, and a light amount of resistance 50-60%)is the optimum balance for fat loss. Epinephrine release is highest in the morning prior to eating , thus, in order to maximize fat burning potential perform exercise routine on an empty stomach.<BR> Prior to training avoid foods that are high in sugar in that they promote the
release of insulin which is counterproductive to the release of growth hormones and fat burning potential.

LEG EXTENSION VS SQUATS: Are they damaging the knee joint?</B></FONT>
<P>  
<FONT FACE="verdana,helvetica" SIZE="-1">
Knee injuries account for 20-30% of all sports injuries.  The most common knee injury is the torn anterior collateral ligament(ACL).  In past years  ACL rehabilitation programs emphasized the use of leg extensions and the elimination of squats.  Recently, because of better understanding of biomechanics of the knee joint, squats have come to the forefront of knee rehabilitation.
<P>
<B>HOW SQUATS STABILIZE THE KNEE:</B><BR>
There are 2 concepts that are important here: Sheer force vs. Compressive force.<BR>
Sheer force is force that is applied parallel to the surface; in other words, the forces are opposing each other in an east-west direction.<BR>
Compressive forces are applies in a perpendicular direction (north-south).  Bones, tendons and ligaments are better adapted to compressive forces vs. sheer forces.
<P>
Both squats and leg extensions activate the quadriceps.  During the quadriceps activity, there is pulling action on the lower leg and if there is no opposing muscle involvement, as in the leg extension, the ACL prevents the tibia (lower leg bone) from moving forward.  This creates a shear on the ACL.<BR>
Squats involve the hamstrings (knee flexor/hip extensor) which co-contracts with the quadriceps and prevents the tibia form being pulled forward, thus creating a positive compressive force.  In addition, because the feet are planted on the ground during squats, the calf muscles are activated which stabilizes the ankle joint and 
aids in knee stability.
<P>
<B>SPECIFICITY OF TRAINING:</B><BR>
The leg extensions isolate the quadricep musculature.  Most activities or sports do not require exclusive quadricep isolation.  However, most activities require a degree of triple extension of the hip, knee, and ankle joints.  Triple extension is strengthened by performing squats.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/strechman.jpg" WIDTH="220 HIGHT="102" ALIGN="right" ALT="Man streching">
<B>OTHER LEG EXERCISES:</B><BR>
Compared with traditional squats, even hack squats, sissy squats, and leg presses do no allow for the same amount of co-contraction of the hamstrings to reduce shear of the knee joint. Nothing can beat a good old fashioned squat.<BR>  
It is unfortunate that squats have developed  a negative reputation from medical trainers and some coaches.  When performed properly, squats are an excellent compound exercise to train multiple muscle groups.<BR>

<BR>
<FONT FACE="verdana,helvetica" SIZE="+1" COLOR="darkgreen">
<B>FUNCTIONAL TRAINING:</B></FONT>
<FONT FACE="verdana,helvetica" SIZE="-1"><B>What is it? Why do we need it?</B></FONT>
<P>
According to Webster's dictionary, functional is defined as <I>"the characteristic of proper activity of a person or thing."</I> The word <I>"functional"</I> is being used by a number of trainers, coaches, and therapists in describing their training programs relative to their athletes or clients.  Unfortunately, a number of these programs are too one dimensional to be labeled functional, and unless your training program is specific to your occupational, recreational, and/or athletic lifestyle, it is not functional.
<P>
The body is a 3 dimensional design that has 3 planes of movement patterns: linear, lateral, and rotational motions.<BR>
But, there are a number of conditioning, speed, and strength programs that are based on training the body with one dimensional exercises and drills.  For example, bench press, arm curls, lat pull downs, ab-crunches, and straight ahead running are all linear movement patterns.<BR>
The brain has a preferential recruitment pattern for muscles that are exercised during integrative (multiple groups) movement patterns as opposed to isolative movements. The bench press, lat pulls, and ab-crunches are isolative movements versus Swiss ball push-ups, medicine ball tosses, and balance board squats, which are multi-dimensional integrative exercises.<BR>
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/manmusclecatlasgreen80x64.gif" ALT="muscleman." WIDTH="80" HEIGHT="64" BORDER="0" ALIGN="left">
It is imperative that functional strength be developed first and foremost prior to progressing to more technical exercises such as bench press, squats, power cleans, etc.<BR> 
<B><I>It is very possible to be "weight room strong" but functionally weak.</I></B><BR>
Without a good functional base one is more prone to injury and optimal performance level can be compromised.

<FONT FACE="verdana,helvetica" SIZE="+1" COLOR="darkgreen">
<B>WARM-UP &amp STRETCHING</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="verdana,helvetica" SIZE="-1">
As mentioned above, the body is a 3 dimensional design, and exercise programs must be implemented relative to that design.
Stretching and warm up drills must be incorporated in the same manner, but there is a fundamental difference between them.
<P>
<B>Warm-up</B> drills normally consist of dynamic movements such as skipping rope, jogging, cycling, change of direction drills, and dynamic stretching. These drills must be performed with low intensity and short duration.<BR>
They are also primarily integrative movements involving multiple muscle groups, in other words, the warm-ups are 3 dimensional in nature.<BR>
<B>Stretching</B> mainly consists of static stretching drills to isolate specific muscles. It is not advisable to stretch a cold tight muscle prior to warm-up, in that the communication pathway from brain to muscle is not as efficient and could potentially cause injury.<BR>
In fact when attempting to stretch a cold tight muscle the brain will try to protect the joint by tightening the muscles around the joint.
<P><IMG SRC="images/runninggigleft.gif" ALT="runningguy." WIDTH="93" HEIGHT="115" BORDER="0" ALIGN="right">
<B>SO, WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO ?</B>
Warm-up properly with light movements followed by stretching<BR>
Studies have shown that when the temperature of the muscle/joint is elevated to 110 &deg F <I>(43&deg C)</I> or higher the range of motion of that joint is increased by 15 to 25&#37.<BR> 
Think about it: if you placed a rubber band in a cold refrigerator or freezer overnight and attempted to stretch it in the morning upon waking up what would happen? The answer is simple, the rubber band would snap or fray. That is exactly what happens to the muscles of the body after sleeping in a bed for 8 hours or sitting in a desk or car for lengths of time prior to participating in an exercise or sport without proper warm-up followed by stretching.
<P>
The muscle is similar to a coil, the more stretch that is placed on it, the more force it will generate in re-coiling.  Range of motion is crucial in the ability to generate velocity.<BR>
<B><I>Performing low intensity movements</I></B> such as light skipping, jogging, shuffles, and directional drills <B><I>are excellent activities to incorporate prior to practice, games, or weight training sessions.</I></B>  Stretching can be performed in conjunction with warm-up drills; however, the bulk of qualitative stretching should be performed during post practice or exercise training session when the muscle temperature is elevated.  <B><I>Post training stretching is the window of time in which the muscles are warm and most pliable.</I></B> Stretching during this time period will help speed up recovery, promote relaxation, reduce soreness, and train the muscles to lengthen from session to session.<BR> 
<B><I>There are certain muscles that have a propensity to shorten and tighten;</I></B> they are referred to as tonic muscles, which consist of: adductors (groin), quadriceps, hamstrings, erectors (low back), soleus, neck, and the hip flexors.  Tonic muscles must be the main focus of stretching.<BR>
Another recommended modality is incorporating a sports massage, which activates the temperature of connective tissue.  While it may not be practical for a team to employ a professional massage therapist, there are products on the market that are reasonable substitutes; the “Team Stick” is a massage stick with rollers that warms up the muscles and speeds up recovery from strenuous training sessions.  The ”Stick” can be used in pre, post, and during practice.
<P>
Keep also in mind that even if one does not lead an active lifestyle, it is highly recommended to perform some movement patterns during the day or preferably in morning to increase the circulation to the muscles followed by some stretching.

<P>
<FONT FACE="verdana,helvetica" SIZE="-1">
Speed is crucial in all sports and all patterns of movement.  In order to produce speed, the body must generate enough force to accelerate from point A to B with rapid and accurate speed.  It has been proven that some individuals are born with the potential to move faster, however, there are a number of athletes who can do a much better job of tapping into their ability to generate more velocity.
<P> 
<B>These 5 crucial areas must be learned and incorporated in the athlete’s training regimen in order to tap into maximizing speed potential:</B>
<UL>
<LI>More than 60% of the fast twitch motor units are located in the hip extensors/flexors and knee extensors;
<LI>The hamstrings, illiopsoas, quadriceps, gastrocnemius (calve) and gluteus maximus are predominantly type 2B muscle fibers (fast twitch) and must be trained at maximal intensity and explosively. Theses muscle groups are the driving force of sprinting, throwing, jumping, and hitting. Suggested exercises…. squats, lunges, heel raises, power cleans, Swiss ball leg curls, medicine ball squat toss, and 1 leg Swiss ball squats;
<LI>Trunk strength is critical in hip stability and mobility. Think of this: what would happen if the trunk of a tree is under developed and the branches are over developed ? The tree will eventually collapse;
<LI>If the abdominal wall of an athlete is weak it can cause a chain reaction in loss of spinal and hip strength thus causing the hips to drift in a lateral motion, which adversely affects mobility and leads to wasted energy in movement;
<LI>Speed is force application in a north/south direction, if there are wasted motions going in a east/west (lateral) direction then speed and force are compromised. Suggested exercises:  Swiss ball crunch, Russian Twist;

<B>SPEED DEVELOPMENT WITH CORDS</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="verdana,helvetica" SIZE="-1">
2 of the 4 ingredients of improving speed are strength and timing. Cord Training 
will increase strength of the limbs which translates to improved 
stride length in sprinting and agility movements. Additionally, Cord 
Training will educate the neuromuscular system to fire more rapidly 
thus producing more force application which improves stride frequency 
and/or turn over ratio of the limbs. If Cord Training is used on a frequent and consistent basis, speed, acceleration, and start/jump strength will vastly improve.<P>
<B>KEEP IN MIND....</B><I>Rotation Rotation  Rotation!</I><BR> 
Too often strength and conditioning programs are one dimensional in nature, in that the movements are linear in motion (bench press, arm curls, squats, military press...). The muscles surrounding the spine must also be trained in a rotational manner in order to facilitate and strengthen movements required in occupational and recreational activities.<BR>
The "Core Training Cord" is an excellent tool for rotationally strengthening the trunk, back, and hip areas.

<B>POSTURE &amp BACK PAIN</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="verdana,helvetica" SIZE="-1">
Did you know the average office worker sitting behind a desk spends over 2,000 hours per year sitting in a chair ?<BR>
Did you also know that <B><I>the leading cause of chronic back pain is poor posture due to excessive sitting in the same position ?</I></B>
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/weightman.gif" ALT="weightman." WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="105" BORDER="0" ALIGN="right">
The human body was not designed to remain in the same position for long periods of time. Standing with good posture places an even distributed force on the bones,
muscles, and connective tissues of the body. While you are sitting in a chair with perfect posture the weight is not evenly distributed versus standing, in fact the amount of force is placed primarily on the spinal column (body weight x 1.2). 
An individual with bad sitting posture has approximately the weight of the body x 1.4 to 1.7 amount of force exerted on the spinal column. Sitting with the shoulders slouched forward and the eyes focused down for 8 hours per day and 2,000 hours per year will cause complications such as forward head shift, flat back, round shoulder syndrome. These ailments can lead to complications relative to nerve transmission and severe orthopedic challenges.<BR>
Sources have indicated that sitting on a Swiss Ball or Sit-Fit will reduce the amount of force placed on the back and promotes activation of the abdominal,
low back, and leg muscles while sitting. 
<P>
<B>6 STEPS TO PREVENT &amp ELIMINATE BACK PAIN:</B><BR>
1. Concentrate on maintenance of good posture while sitting and standing<BR>
2. Avoid staying in the same position for excessive periods of time<BR>
3. Exercise regularly and stretch muscles everyday<BR>
4. Reduce excessive body fat; excess body fat places strain on body and weakens the abdominal muscles which places a great strain on the back<BR>
5. Have computer monitor placed at eye level to prevent strain on neck
muscles<BR>
6. Invest in a Swiss Ball to sit on and save on your back
<P>
<B>Maintain Good Posture</B><BR>
Posture is a by-product strengthening the trunk, hips, and shoulder areas.  Performance emanates from good posture.<BR>
Poor posture causes the body to waste energy in attempting to fight gravity and maintain a neutral spine.  If the muscles surrounding the spinal column are not educated to stabilize during dynamic movement, patterns performance levels will be compromised.

<B>Train For Power Not For Looks</B><BR> 
There are a number of athletes who have the mentality to train similar to a competitive body builder.  The body is an integrative design in that our brain prefers combined movements not isolative movements.  Body building training is primarily isolative training in which the “cosmetic appeal” is the bottom line.  For example, softball is a multidimensional sport that is integrative.  Running, jumping, throwing and landing are movements that are occurring forcefully and within fractional seconds.  Integrative training is a must for the softball athlete!
