That</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>the Substitution Cost is the
Number of Deaths (Normalized to the Population Size) Required for a Substitution</font></font></b></center>

<p>I believe that Haldane defined the cost of natural selection as the
number of selective deaths (normalized to the population size) required
for a substitution. As an example, if the population size of a haploid
organism were 10,000, Haldane calculated the substitution cost of going
from one individual carrying a favorable trait to the entire population
carrying the trait as follows. Cost = - ln(p<sub>0</sub>), where p<sub>0</sub>
is the initial frequency of the favorable trait. For this example, p<sub>0</sub>
is 1/10,000. The natural log (ln) of 1/10,000 is -9.21, which leads to
a cost of 9.21. A cost of 9.21 indicates that 9.21 times the population
size must die in order for the substitution to occur. Since the population
size is 10,000 for our example, this means that approximately 92,100 individuals
must die for the favorable trait to become fixed. The conclusion that the
cost represents the number of deaths required for the substitution to occur
is from very careful reading and rereading of his paper. Here are some
excerpts from "The Cost of Natural Selection" that led me to this conclusion.
<p><i>"The principal unit process in evolution is the substitution of one
gene&nbsp; for another at the same locus. ... I shall show that the <b>number
of deaths needed to carry out this unit process</b> by selective survival
is independent of the intensity of selection over a wide range."&nbsp;</i>
page 511
<p><i>"It is convenient to think of natural selection provisionally in
terms of juvenile deaths. If it acts in this way, by killing off the less
fit genotypes, <b>we shall calculate how many must be killed while a new
gene is spreading through a population</b>."</i>&nbsp; page 512
<p>"[Haldane is speaking about the process of natural selection in a deteriorating
environment]... <i>But meanwhile, <b>a number of deaths, or their equivalents
in lowered fertility</b>, have occurred. If selection at the i<sup>th</sup>
selected locus is responsible for d<sub>i</sub>&nbsp; of these deaths in
any generation the reproductive capacity of the species will be <font face="Symbol">P</font>(1
- d<sub>i</sub>) of that of the optimal genotype , or exp(-<font face="Symbol">S</font>d<sub>i</sub>)
nearly, if every d<sub>i</sub> is small. Thus the intensity of selection
approximates to <font face="Symbol">S</font>d<sub>i</sub>."&nbsp;</i> page
514
<p>[D is what Haldane called the substitution cost or the cost of natural
selection.]
<br><i>"Let D<sub>i</sub> be the sum of the values of d<sub>i</sub> over
all generations of selection, ..."</i>&nbsp; page 514
<p>Haldane then goes on to discuss the calculation of D for many different
cases - haploid, diploid, etc. On page 516, summing up the haploid case,
he says:
<p><i>"We may, therefor, take&nbsp; it that when selection is fairly slow,
<b>the
total number of selective deaths over all generations</b> is usually 5-15
times the total number in the population in each generation, 10 times this
being a representative value."</i>
<p>Finally, Haldane's 1960 paper "More Precise Expressions for the Cost
of Natural Selection" (Journal of Genetics 57:351-360) begins with a very
clear definition of the cost of natural selection:
<p><i>"Haldane (1957) gave expressions for the "<b>cost" of natural selection</b>,
that is to say for<b> the total number of deaths, or their equivalent in
reduced fertility</b>, sometimes called "genetical deaths", <b>which must
occur in a population of constant size before a gene is replaced by one
of its allelomorphs</b>. Smith (1958) and Kimura (1960) have accepted the
theory; <b>the latter uses the term "substitutional load", for the component
of the deathrate at any time which is due to this evolutionary process.</b></i>
<p>There are lots of other quotes in the "The Cost of Natural Selection"
along this line. Haldane clearly defined the cost of natural selection
to be the cumulative total of all selective deaths in the course of a gene
substitution (normalized to the population size). Obviously, for the population
size to remain constant, there must be an equivalent number of surplus
births somewhere. Therefor, the cost can also be said to represent the
amount of reproductive excess required to keep the population from declining
due to the deaths required for the substitution to occur.
