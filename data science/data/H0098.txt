<P><B>Systematics is the underlying cornerstone of all biology. To work
with a plant or an animal, we must first give it a name. Systematics deals
with the description of biological species, the development of classifications
of these species so that information about them may be readily retrieved,
and the study of the evolutionary relationships between them. </B></P>

<P><B>Systematics consists of several components. The basic component is
the the delineation of the separate species and their description. To make
a car, first make the car parts. This component of systematics is sometimes
called taxonomy, although systematics and taxonomy are sometimes used equally.
The proper, legal application of names to species concepts is nomenclature.
Nomenclature is simply the rules that must be followed in giving names to
species. Almost all plant and animal groups today use the binomial nomenclature
approach assigning each species a binomial name based on a generic and specific
epithet based on Latin or Greek. For example humans belong to the genus
and species <I>Homo sapiens</I> which translates into &quot;wise man&quot;.
Binomial nomenclature has its historical roots in the practice of describing
species in Latin. As time passed the descriptions became shorter and shorter
(to save space) until Linnaeus formalized the procedure into a consistent
general description (the generic name) and the specific description (the
species name). The genus <I>Homo</I> has a single living species (modern
man), although extinct species are known. The genus <I>Euxoa</I> in the
cutworm moths has several hundred species. Binomial names are grouped into
families, families into orders, orders into classes, classes into phyla,
and phyla into kingdoms. For example the genus <I>Euxoa</I> belongs to the
family Noctuidae (cutworm moths), the family Noctuidae belongs to the order
Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies). The Lepidoptera belong to the class
Insecta (insects), the class Insecta belongs to the phylum Arthropoda (e.g.
insects, spiders, crabs), and the phylum Arthropoda belongs to the kingdom
Eucaryotes.</B></P>

<P><B>The second component of systematics is classification. Species are
arranged in a hierarchical system (species, genus, family, order, and so
forth) to make it easier to keep track of them. The resulting classification
is sometimes viewed as a tree with an ancestor at the bottom, branching
out into smaller and smaller branches finally reaching the level of species
at the tips of the branches. Modern systematics almost always assumes that
a classification should reflect the evolutionary history of the group. However
classifications are merely retrieval structures and do not have to be based
on evolution. For example the classifications of Linnaeus and the earliest
systematists were developed long before evolution was recognized or conceived
of. Genera and species were grouped simply by the mutually sharing of some
particular character. For example, species could be grouped on the basis
of having, or not having, wings. Wings, of course, have evolved independently
many times, but as a purely mechanical way of grouping species and forming
a classification, there is no law saying you can't do it this way if others
are willing to use the classification. Linnaeus was, in fact, an ardent
creationist and viewed classifications as matters of convenience. However
his classifications were based to a large degree on shared derived characters
(although he had no idea of what a shared, derived character is). His classifications,
based on a hierarchical structure of species with shared characters, were
later to prove to be one of the primary catalysts in the development of
evolutionary thought even though Linnaeus certainly had no such intention
in mind when he constructed them. If you ever need an example of serendipity,
this is a classic example.</B></P>

<P><B>Although classifications do not need to be based on phylogeny, for
all practical purposes all major classifications these days are intended
to represent the evolutionary history of the group. Classifications techniques
fall generally into three schools of thought:</B></P>

<P><B>Evolutionary Systematics. Evolutionary systematics is just a fancy
name for the way classifications were constructed before the days of modern
phylogenetic systematics. Basically a systematist became familiar with his
group and then arranged his classification to reflect what he believed represented
the evolutionary history of the group. The author of this article was originally
trained in this methodology. The evolutionary systematist had an underlying
feeling for what he was doing, but his exact methodology was rarely verbalized.
This is the great weakness of evolutionary systematics. The truth is that
the underlying principles used by most evolutionary systematists are basically
nearly equivalent to those of the cladist despite the arguments that arose
between the two schools. Computational methodology became confused with
underlying operating principles. Indeed the basic concepts of cladistics
were formulated long before they came to be called cladistics.</B></P>

<P><B>Phenetics (Numerical Taxonomy). Phenetics took a statistical approach
to the construction of classifications and is based on overall resemblance.
Pheneticists reasoned that if enough characters were analyzed and a general
measure of overall similarity were used, the resulting classification would,
in the end, resemble the evolutionary history of the group simply because
any problems would be swamped by the overwhelming mass of the data. This,
unfortunately, did not turn out to be the case and phenetics is rarely used
today in constructing classifications or phylogenetic reconstruction. However
the computational procedures developed have had a tremendous influence on
the techniques used by cladists is deriving their classifications.</B></P>

<P><B>Cladistics (Phylogenetic Systematics). Cladistics is the dominant
form of classification methodology and phylogeny analysis used today. It
represents a combination of a set of formal underlying principles and computational
techniques. To learn about some of the computational methodologies, please
refer to the links listed on the systematics page. The underlying principles
of cladistics are outlined below.</B></P>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<P><B>A Few Underlying Principles of Phylogenetic Systematics</B></P>

<P><B>Phylogenetic systematics holds the view that classifications must
represent the underlying phylogeny of the species and higher categories.
To achieve this goal cladistics has formalized the following principles.</B></P>

<P><B>Groups must be formed on the basis of shared, derived characters.
A shared, derived character is a character that first appeared in an ancestoral
species and is exhibited (unless subsequently lost) by its descendents.
In other words a character must be homologous in all of the species placed
in a group and the result of a common ancestor. The scales on the wings
of butterflies and moths are an example of a shared, derived character and
is one morphological feature used in joining the moths and butterflies into
the order Lepidoptera. Groups cannot be formed on the basis of characters
that look alike but are not the result of their inheritance from a common
ancestor. For example the wings of bats and birds are not homologous and
arose independently in the birds and the mammals. Therefore the presence
or absence of wings cannot be used to form a group. A corollary of this
rule forbids the construction of a group based on the absence of a character.
For example you cannot make a group based on the absence of wings.</B></P>

<P><B>Groups must be monophyletic. By monophyletic cladists mean that all
of the members of a single group must have a common ancestor. There are
two common situations that violate this rule; paraphyly and polyphyly.</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="polyphy.jpg" WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="237" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3" BORDER="1"></P>

<P><B>The diagram on the left shows a case of polyphyly. The genus &quot;A&quot;
appears twice in the phylogeny of this particular family of organisms. Polyphyly
is not acceptable under the rules of phylogenetic systematics and the &quot;Genus
A&quot; on either the right or left hand side of the tree needs to be given
its own name, perhaps &quot;Genus F&quot;.</B></P>

<P><IMG SRC="paraphy.gif" WIDTH="216" HEIGHT="233" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3" BORDER="1"><B>The diagram on the left shows a case of paraphyly. One
group of equivalent rank cannot be contained within another according to
the rules of phylogenetic systematics. In the example &quot;Genus &quot;B&quot;
is contained within the &quot;Genus A&quot;. This is not allowed and either
&quot;Genus B&quot; must be synonymized with &quot;Genus A&quot; (no longer
a separate genus), or all of the branches of the tree must be given a separate
generic name. Paraphyly is a common problem in older classification. Birds
represent a classic example of paraphyly. Birds have always been given their
own class, Aves. Birds, most people agree, however are derived dinosaurs.
The solutions are to either do away with Aves as a class and make them part
of the Dinosauria, or to raise all of the dinosaur groups to class level.
There is a third solution. Ignore the problem.</B></P>

<P><B>Bioinformatics. The last component of systematics is the storage and
retrieval of information. The most important service of systematics is to
provide a convenient method of storing and retrieving information on the
species of living organisms. Indeed classifications were originally developed
for this very purpose. Once species have been delineated and described and
arranged in a classification, the resulting system can be used as a giant
library catalog to store and retrieve information about each species such
as its biology, distribution, genetics, behavior, and so forth. Increasingly
computer databases are being developed to do just this.</B></P>
