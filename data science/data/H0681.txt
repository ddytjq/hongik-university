<center>&nbsp;<b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Derivation for the
Cost of Selection for a Haploid Organism</font></font></b></center>

<p>What we would like to do now is to find a simple equation for the cost
of natural selection. Following Haldane, we find a differential equation
for the cost in a single generation, and then integrate that over all generations.
<br>We can find the differential change in q with respect to time. Using
the generation for the unit of time,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; dq/dt = [-s*q*p]/[1 - s*q].
<p>Haldane chose to ignore the denominator for small s. For instance, if
s is .01 and q is .99, the denominator would be 1 - 0.01*.99 which equals
0.9901. Ignoring the denominator introduces an error of 1 - 0.9901&nbsp;
= 0.0099 in one generation. This is an error of less than 1% per generation,
and it will go down as q is reduced. Haldane felt this could be ignored,
but others have disagreed with Haldane on this point.
<p>Ignoring the denominator gives us:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; dq/dt = -s*q*p
<br>Remembering that p = 1 - q,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; dq/dt = -s*q*(1 - q)
<p>Also, by rearrangement, we see that dt = -dq/(s*q*(1-q).
<p>Integrating gives us:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; D = s * <font face="Symbol"><font size=+1>&ograve;</font><sub>0</sub><sup>&yen;
</sup></font>q*dt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(That is, s multiplied by the integral from t= infinity to t=0 of q*dt.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because dt = -dq/(s*q*(1-q), q at time
infinity = 0 (the a allele is disappearing from the population), and q
at time 0 is defined as q<sub>0</sub> we can replace dt and put the range
of the integral in terms of q as follows:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D&nbsp; = s * <font face="Symbol"><font size=+1>&ograve;</font></font><sub>q0</sub><sup>0</sup>q*[-dq/s*q*(1-q)]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D&nbsp; = <strike>s</strike> * <font face="Symbol"><font size=+1>&ograve;</font></font><sub>q0</sub><sup>0</sup><strike>q</strike>*[-dq/<strike>s</strike>*<strike>q</strike>*(1-q)]&nbsp;&nbsp;
(The s and q terms are both canceled out.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D&nbsp; = <font face="Symbol"><font size=+1>&ograve;</font></font><sub>q0</sub><sup>0</sup>-dq/(1-q)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D = <font face="Symbol"><font size=+1>&ograve;</font></font><sub>0</sub><sup>q0</sup>dq/(1-q)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Switching the order of integration canceled the negative sign.)
<br>Evaluating the integral:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D = -ln(1 - q<sub>0</sub>) + O(s)
<p>O(s) is a non specified (but small) correction factor that accounts
for the fact that the a alleles are never truly eliminated from the population
because new copies will be created due to new mutations (back mutations).
I am aware of no reason to consider this correction factor further and
will henceforth omit it.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Remembering that p<sub>0</sub> = 1 - q<sub>0</sub> and
dropping the correction factor, we have
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; D = -ln(p<sub>0</sub>)
<br>This equation tells us that the fraction of selective deaths for a
substitution to occur is given by the natural logarithm of the initial
frequency of the allele that will be fixed.
