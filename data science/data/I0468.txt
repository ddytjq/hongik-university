<p>Save Our Seats launches legal action against Newcastle United FC. The Save Our Seats campaign today announces the launch of a representative legal action against Newcastle United FC on behalf of bondholders threatened with forced relocation to facilitate the creation of new corporate hospitality areas at St James’s Park.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SOS have engaged the services of
McCormicks, a specialist law firm in sports matters, to take up their case. Counsel’s opinion has been sought, and the lawyers’ feelings are that the fans have a good case with every chance of success. Solicitor Richard Cramer said: “We believe there are question marks about the validity of the bond scheme, about the enforceability of the express terms and about the implied terms both in the scheme itself and contained in the advertising material. I feel very confident that the Court would be able to resolve this dispute in a matter of weeks.”&nbsp;</p>
<p> Bondholders’ endorsement sought The legal action is being brought in the name of four affected bondholders, but is a representative action on behalf of all bondholders. The SOS campaign is appealing to other bondholders to add their name to a list supporting the action; to date over 50 bondholders have endorsed the action. Jane Duffy, one of the four bondholders initiating the action, said: “This is not just about the four of us, but every bondholder, every season ticket holder and every fan. If the club get away with moving us, then no bond is worth the paper it’s written on, and no fan’s seat is safe. Even those on the waiting list will suffer. We’re calling on every other bondholder – as it’s only bondholders who can bring this action – to sign up in support. There’s no risk involved, but every name strengthens our case. And when we win, every fan will benefit.”&nbsp;</p>
<h4><!--mstheme--><font color="#330099"> Financial appeal launched - £30,000 needed.<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
<p>&nbsp;Save Our Seats is also launching an appeal for funds to finance the legal action and to ensure that no individual fan incurs any financial penalty. Plans are in place for collection boxes to be in 100 Tyneside pubs and clubs by the weekend, and campaign organisers are calling on all Newcastle fans to rush donations to Save Our Seats, PO Box 72,
Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, NE28 0YY. Frank Gilmour, chair of the Independent Newcastle United Supporters’ Association, said: “36,000 fans showed the strength of feeling on this issue at last Monday’s match. Now we all have to put our hands in our pockets to make sure that this legal challenge can proceed. We’ll all benefit if this plan is stopped, so we all have a duty to contribute. We can’t allow the burden to fall on a small number – we’re all in this together.”
