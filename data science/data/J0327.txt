      <P>I remember my first Drivers' Education (DE) event as though
      it were yesterday. I'd purchased a sports car a few years before
      and had slowly weaned myself on fast rides through the local
      twisties, getting faster and faster each go until I determined
      I was just too fast for public roads and with my luck, avoiding
      detection was stretched as far as I dared! One day I heard about
      something called Autocross&#133;an event held on a short but
      twisty course that would teach me all I needed to know about
      my car's handling, tire pressures, alignment, tires, and scuff
      marks on my bumpers. It also taught me that I had absolutely
      no patience for standing around waiting or playing corner worker
      for 8 hours just to get several minute long runs in&#133;I was
      growing old and not driving, something was awfully wrong with
      that picture.<BR>
      </P>

      <P>And then someone mentioned they were off to Roebling Track
      (Savannah, Ga. Area) with PCA and I begged to go along. I'd grown
      up in rural Connecticut but just a stone throw from Lime Rock
      Park and my Dad had been a mechanic for a now defunct racing
      team back in the early sixties. They used to go to Bridgehampton,
      the Glen, and many others. Hey, I had the same genes so I'm qualified
      right? Crown Region of PCA was nice enough to accept my application
      and before I knew it, I was on my way.<BR>
      </P>

      <P>But this is about what I did to get ready before heading for
      the track. First of all, I found a good book &quot;Going Faster:
      Mastering the Art of Race Driving: The Skip Barber Racing School,&quot;
      by Carl Lopez and Danny Sullivan, and read it cover to cover
      several times&#133;at least I was going to know the terms. Turns
      out it was a pretty good primer for what to look for on my car
      too. I also used the checklist that accompanied my Crown Region
      application for this task and if you read no further, do only
      those things, you'll be well prepared. But you'd miss all the
      fun! <BR>
      </P>

      <P>Someplace in your preparation you'll suddenly realize that
      you and your car are going to get on a real track&#133;not the
      left hand turns only or a modified road course but a real go
      fast piece of real estate with twisties and maybe even some ups
      and downs! You're going to visualize cars with wild paint schemes
      and ads for soap and various kinds of oils and such all over
      them&#133;flaming exhausts, and helmeted gladiators with determined
      faces and no hearing due to years of too many decibel exhaust
      note. Your head will echo with names such as Watkins Glenn, Lime
      Rock, Sebring, Le Mans, Spa, Road Atlanta, Sears Point, and others&#133;and
      then you're going to see you, in your favorite street car in
      your most determined mirror pose and if you're at all normal,
      you'll wonder what in hell you got urself into!<BR>
      </P>

      <P>But let's suppose you're more the academic and have tuned
      into several books, picked the mind of one or two &quot;experienced&quot;
      friends and have been devouring the Rennlist net or other I-net
      discussion sites and now you're wondering if those stock seat
      belts should be wider and have a 5 or 6 point hookup. You're
      concerned that your Discount Tire D60A2s might grip better if
      they were more worn and you wonder if the hard top would be better
      reinforced by a roll bar of some make. And then you wonder if
      the you in the mirror and in the anticipated podium shot is really
      better suited for a driving suit, shoes, gloves, and a more expensive
      helmet than you originally planned and you'll be begging the
      local drugstore to be your sponsor!<BR>
      </P>

      <P>Well partner, here's where it pays to take a deep breath of
      reality and re-establish contact with terra firma. First of all,
      revisit what a DE is all about. It's not a race school. It's
      not a fashion show. It's not an excuse to get all those car mods
      you don't understand why you need and can't afford anyway. What
      it is, is a chance for you to drive your car on a controlled
      entry circuit in a circumstance designed to assist you to better
      learn how to drive and how to anticipate what others out there
      might do under similar circumstances&#133;what you learn should
      be 100% transferable to your everyday driving. And the good news
      is that you will get an instructor to help you along the path.
<BR>
      </P>

      <P>My first instructor was unreal. He rode at least &quot;four&quot;
      20 minute sessions with me, patiently showing me how to anticipate,
      determine a good driving line, recognize corner stations, learning
      to point faster cars by, applauding the successes and patiently
      explaining a better approach to my novice mistakes. About half
      way through the &quot;fifth&quot; session, I began to realize
      there was someone else in the car with me as I intermittently
      heard another voice other than my own inner self screaming with
      delight! The point here is that instructors realize where you
      are and trust me (I am one); they know a lot of their initial
      instruction could be in an unknown dialect and the newbie driver
      would still be nodding in agreement! They know that their job
      is to keep you and others in your run group safe from yourself
      and each other, and that's their real initial focus&#133;they
      know that eventually you'll come around and start responding
      to external as well as internal stimuli (smile). It's at this
      point that you will really take a deep breath, understand why
      you are at your first DE and will look your instructor in the
      eye and he/she will respond with a knowing smile and you'll move
      on.<BR>
      </P>

      <P>Now, just a bit on equipment. Barnie, all you need for your
      first DE is a good car with standard safety equipment, comparable
      seat restraints for both you and the instructor, good tires,
      a helmet that you're satisfied is sufficient to protect the value
      of your head, and a long sleeved cotton shirt and pants. Tennis
      shoes work just fine as long as they are not all knobby on the
      bottom or too wide (may get caught in the pedals) and cotton
      socks are required. You also need all the excitement and enthusiasm
      you can muster&#133;it's going to be one of the best times you're
      ever had! You'll swagger away and meet with friends in a social
      situation and lie about how late you braked into turn one and
      outline the mods you'll have made to your car by the next DE.
      But someplace in a quiet corner, but always within ear shot,
      will be your instructor, and they'll be smiling&#133;not because
      you're ahead of yourself&#133;but because they did their job
      well and you're hooked and you're safe!<BR>
      </P>

      <P>So get out there and have some fun! It's safe, it's educational,
      and you'll meet some of the nicest and most helpful people in
      the world!<BR>
      </P>
