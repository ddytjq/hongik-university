<h1><b>International standard for the C++ programming language published</h1></b>
</center>
<p>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
<p>
14 October 1998
<p>
INTERNATIONAL STANDARD FOR C++ PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE PUBLISHED AND AVAILABLE
<p>
Santa Cruz, CA - 
<p>
The new ISO/IEC C++ Standard has been published by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO).  The date of publication was September 1, 1998.  Copies of the
standard are available for purchase from the national standards bodies that participate
in ISO.
<p>
Machine-readable copies of the C++ Standard are available for downloading at
<a href="http://www.ansi.org">the ANSI Electronic Store</a>.
The cost is $18.00 USD payable on-line via
credit card.  The downloaded document is in PDF form, 2794KB total size.
<p>
The printed version is available for purchase from the 
same web site (<a href="http://www.ansi.org">http://www.ansi.org</a>).
Choose "Catalogs/Standards Information", then "ANSI-ISO-IEC Online Catalog",
then search for "14882".  The price per copy is $175.00 USD.
<p>
The official designation of the C++ standard is ISO/IEC 14882-1998; its title is
"Information Technology - Programming Languages - C++".
<p>
On July 22nd, the Central Secretariat of ISO confirmed the final approval and impending publication of the global standard for the C++ programming language. C++ is one of the most widely used software tools in the world with more than 1.5 million users.   The national standards bodies of 20 different countries voted unanimously in favor of the completed content for an international standard for the C++ programming language.   The ballot was conducted by the Joint Technical Committee #1 (JTC1) of ISO and IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission). 
"Final ratification by the JTC1 was the last procedural hurdle for the C++ standard," says Thomas Plum, president of Plum Hall Inc. and convener of the ISO C++ Working Group. 

<p>
Today, the C++ software programming tool is used on nearly all computers from the most
powerful supercomputers and commercial mainframes to ubiquitous personal computers and
unseen microprocessors.   
<p>
The C++ standard covers both the C++ language itself and its standard library.  The
library represents a significant improvement over what has been generally available.
It will ease the task of learning C++ and make it far simpler to write programs that
run on a variety of platforms. 
<p>
During the 1990s, C++ became the dominant programming language for  demanding applications
in such diverse fields as finance, embedded systems, telecommunications, and computer-aided
design.
<p>
Software tools providers are already shipping C++ implementations and tools that approximate
the standard. The C++ library provides standard input/output, containers (such as vectors,
lists, maps and strings), non-numerical  algorithms (such as sort, search, and merge), and
support for numeric computation. As a result of the international effort, the C++ standard
provides extensive support for the use of national character sets (e.g., European national
characters and Japanese characters). 
<p>
Since the standardization process began in 1989, representatives from Australia, Canada, 
Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, the 
United Kingdom, and the United States have met regularly, along with representatives from 
about a hundred companies and many interested individuals, to write a mutually agreed upon 
standard. Companies that have contributed to the standard include industry giants such as 
AT&T, Ericsson, Digital, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Mentor Graphics, Microsoft, Silicon 
Graphics, Sun Microsystems, and Siemens.   
<p>
C++ was initially designed and implemented by Dr. Bjarne Stroustrup at AT&T
Labs (then AT&T Bell Labs). The first commercial version was released in 1985.  The language gained widespread use in industry and academia during the 1980s, and around 1990 the major 
computer and software tools suppliers started to provide C++ to their users as a major 
implementation tool.  After explosive growth of the C++ user population in the 1980s and 
early 1990s where C++ usage doubled nearly every seven months, the use of C++ has settled 
into a pattern of steady growth (on the order of 15% to 30% a year). The new standard is 
expected to sustain and stimulate this growth. 

<p>
Ongoing news about the progress of the standard will be posted to the "C++
Standard" topic at <a href="http://www.plumhall.com">http://www.plumhall.com</a>.
