Repayment Protection can pay your loan repayments up to a total of &pound;1,500 per month if you can't work because of accident, illness or involuntary unemployment. Once you have been off work for 30 days we will pay an amount equal to your monthly repayment. This will continue each month until you return to work, your loan is repaid or, for unemployment benefits, you receive the maximum of 12 monthly repayments, which ever happens first. If you die your outstanding loan balance will be paid up to a total of &pound;25,000.

<P><B>Jobcare </B>
<BR>At The Co-operative Bank we recognise the need for more than just the security of an insurance policy to protect your loan repayments, should unemployment occur in your family. 
<BR>That is why we have provided Jobcare, a completely confidential 24-hour telephone advisory service available immediately to you and your spouse or partner. Jobcare could be your guide back to employment. 
<BR>This is just a summary of cover. Full terms and conditions, including how to make a claim, are in the Certificate of Insurance (a specimen is available on request) which will be sent to you if you take this cover. If the cover does not meet your needs, return the Certificate within 28 days, the insurance will be cancelled without charge if no claim has been made. 
<BR>Insurers share information with each other to prevent fraudulent claims via a Register of Claims. A list of participants and the name and address of the operator are available on request. In the event of a claim any information you have supplied relevant to the insurance, and on the claim form, together with any other information relating to the claim, will be provided to the Register. 
<BR>There is a choice of law for this insurance but unless agreed otherwise, English law applies. 
<BR>The Policyholders Protection Act 1997 may provide compensation if the insurers were to become insolvent. 
<BR>This insurance has been arranged by The Co-operative Bank p.l.c., as agents for whom the insurers take responsibility. The bank has undertaken to comply with the Association of British Insurers Code of Practice for the selling of General Insurance, a copy of the Code is available on request. 
<BR>If you have any problem regarding this insurance please contact The Co-operative Bank p.l.c. or you can contact London &amp; Edinburgh, Head Office, The Warren, Worthing, West Sussex, BN14 9QD. If this does not resolve your problem you may write to the Chief Executive at the above address. If still dissatisfied you may refer to either the Insurance Ombudsman Bureau at 135 Park Street, London SEI 9EA or the Association of British Insurers, (of which the Insurers are members) at 51 Gresham Street, London EC2V 7HQ. Your legal rights are not affected by these procedures. Telephone calls may be monitored or recorded. 
<BR>Repayment Protection cover is underwritten by London and Edinburgh Insurance Company Limited (Registered Number 924430 England) and London and Edinburgh Life Assurance Company Limited (Registered Number 830354 England), both companies limited by shares and incorporated in England.
