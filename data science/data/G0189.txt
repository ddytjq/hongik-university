<b><a name="background">Background Information/Procedure:</a></b>
<blockquote>

<p>It is the year 2070 and you and your crew of interstellar astronauts
are prepared to take the first journey of humans beyond Pluto!  Your
mission is to test, firsthand, the predictions of Einstein's General
Theory of Relativity.  Specifically, your goal is a black hole some
10,000 light-years away.  Because of its distance, the trip will be a
multigenerational one.  Your offspring, and theirs, and so on, will be
trained in your task to complete the mission.</p>

<p>As chief engineer, you have been assigned to ensure the safety of your crew and
craft.  You are armed with your trusty Interstellar Navigational
Handbook from a college course you took on interstellar travel.  In it
you find the following constants and equations:

<p>Your spacecraft, Veracious, is a Lockheed Martin X-120 Far Range
Prober.  Its mass, including cargo and robot probes, is 10,000 kg. Each
robot probe weighs100 kg, has a height of 10 m, and has a thrust
capacity of 50,000 N of thrust for a duration of 10 hours.   

<p>The Veracious has a maximum controllable thrust of 800,000 N and uses
the newest waste/debris fusion-reactor system as its propellant system
(it uses waste materials and cosmic dust in fusion reactions to produce
energy).  This system requires minimal on-board fuel.  (Engineer's
Note: The mass of the Veracious will remain constant throughout the trip, 
unlike earlier conventional spacecraft whose mass decreased as fuel was
used up.)

<p>What makes the Far Ranger Prober really special, though, is its quark
fusion quantum accelerator, which has the capability of boosting the
Veracious' velocity to 80 percent of the speed of light (or reducing it by the
same amount).  This ability is crucial because even at that speed, the trip will
take you more than ten thousand years.  Relativistic effects at such high
velocities will, however, make the trip shorter for the astronauts on
board the Veracious, if not for the Earth observers back home.

<p>As chief engineer, the success of the mission rests firmly in your hands
(and head!).  Good luck!!</blockquote>
<p><hr><p>
<b><a name="procedures">Questions:</a></b>
<blockquote>
<ol> 
<li>Your energy-calculation notes from college show that for any object
to escape the gravitational pull of a planet, star, and so on, the object must
first achieve escape velocity, or vesc.  What velocity must the Veracious
achieve to escape Earth?

<p><li>To determine how long you must power the thrusters, you must first
determine the acceleration they are capable of generating for the
Veracious.  Use the above information to do this calculation. 

<p><li>You know that an acceleration of more than 10 g's is fatal to
humans, so quickly you calculate how many g's the above acceleration
is.  Are the g-forces at full thrust survivable?

<p><li>How long must the engines be powered at full thrust to achieve escape
velocity?

<p><li>Once the Veracious is clear of the Earth's gravity, NASA operating
procedure calls for the firing of the quark fusion quantum accelerator
to boost velocity to 80 percent of the speed of light.  After that, no acceleration
by either fusion reactor will operate except for course corrections and
the return trip to Earth.  At the rate of 0.8c then, how many years will
it take for you to reach your destination?

<p><li>Einstein determined that according to his Special Theory of
Relativity, time actually slows for those traveling at speeds near the
speed of light.  Using the formula for time dilation and the time
calculated as seen from Earth in the previous calculation, determine how
many years will pass as observed by the occupants of the Veracious.

<p><li>Along the way, you discover a neutron star.  This neutron star is
typical, having a mass of 2.0 x 1030 kg and a radius of 10,000 m.  Although 
neutron stars are incredibly hot (1,000,000 K) they emit relatively
little visible electromagnetic radiation, which explains why you did not
observe this star before.  The crew decides to take advantage of the
unanticipated opportunity to explore this cousin to the black hole.  The
stellar astronomers wish to send a robot probe (able to withstand
incredible temperatures) to the surface to obtain a 1 kg sample of the
star.  

<p>Getting the robot probe to the surface would be straightforward, they
explain--release the probe into a spiraling orbit until it finally nears
the surface of the neutron star.  When close enough, a scoop would reach
down for a sample as the probe continues to orbit just above the star. 
Probe thrusters would then be used to return the probe to the Veracious.

<p>In fitting the robot probe with a sample scoop, you wonder what volume
of sample is needed for a 1 kg sample.
<p><ul>
a) First determine the density of the neutron star.  For reference, 
recall that water has a density of 1 x 103 kg/m<sup><font size=-2>3</font></sup> and that the Earth has an
average density of 5.52 x 103 kg/m<sup><font size=-2>3</font></sup>.




<p>b) What volume will a 1 kg sample of the star take up in m<sup><font size=-2>3</font></sup>?  In cm<sup><font size=-2>3</font></sup>? Will you need a shovel, a spoon or an ultraminiature scoop?</ul>


<p><li>For any object to maintain an orbit about another, the centripetal
force, Fc, must be provided by the gravitational force, FG; thus Fc = FG. 
If the robot probe were to orbit right at the surface of the star, what
velocity must it maintain?


<p><li> At that velocity, how long would it take the robot probe to circle
the star?



<p><li>Calculate the VERTICAL escape velocity required to leave from the surface of the star.


<p><li>If the robot probes are equipped with enough fuel to provide 50,000
N of thrust for 10 hours, would they be able to escape the neutron
star?  (Hint: Calculate the maximum acceleration of robot probe first.)


<p><li>As the chief engineer, what do you think of the proposed plan to
retrieve a sample from the neutron star?  Explain.

<p><li>Many generations after the Veracious first left Earth, one of the
stellar astronomers makes a peculiar observation.  Five approaching stars have exactly the same spectra,
 implying that they are made of exactly the same kinds and amounts of elements.  Even more curious is the
fact that the five stars are positioned exactly at the corners of a
perfect pentagon.

<p>Upon hearing this news the relativistic physicist of the crew gets very
excited.  "What we're observing," he explains, "is a gravitational
lensing affect caused by a black hole!  You see very intense gravitational
fields that have the ability to bend light rays.  What we are
actually seeing is a single star on the far side of a black hole. 
Normally we would not be able to see the light at all because the black
hole is in the way.  However, the gravity of the black hole is bending
that light around the black hole and directing it to us, where we see it
as five identical stars!"

<p>"We can't see the black hole itself, of course, because no light
escapes it to reach our eyes.  Black holes are only detectable by the
gravitational effects we can observe on other objects.  If a black hole
occurs as half of a binary system, detection visibly is more obvious."

<p>As the Veracious approaches the black hole, the crew is able to calculate
its mass your distance from it and the degree to which it tugs
on your ship.  The crew finds that the mass of the black hole (2.2 x 1030
kg) is surprisingly similar to that of the neutron star's!  However, the black
hole's physical radius is even smaller, at 3 km.

<p>You know better than to send a robot probe to the surface of the black hole 
because you realize that you could never retrieve it.  Just to confirm the
issue, however, calculate the escape velocity necessary to leave the
surface of this black hole.  Explain why it is not only impractical to
send and retrieve a probe from the surface, it is IMPOSSIBLE!




<p><li>The black hole is only the size of a small town, yet its
gravitational influence stretches well beyond its physical boundaries. 
Given the mass of the black hole the mass of the object of interest and
one's distance from the black hole one can easily compute the
gravitational force, FG, experienced by an object.  
<p><ul>
a) The robot probes are 10 meters in height and are vertically divided
into three basic sections--the bottom portion is the lander, the
midsection is the scientific and general controller, and the top is for
navigation and communication with a remote pilot.  Which portion would
experience the greatest attraction to the black hole?  Which the least? 
Why?



<p>b) To examine the difference of the gravitational force between top and
bottom, first derive a generalized formula for such a difference in force
(assume that the top section of the probe will always be 10 m farther
away from the black hole than the bottom is). What is the difference
in gravitaional force from top to bottom if the craft's bottom is
1.0 x 10<sup><font size=-2>8</sup></font> m from the center of the black hole.


<p>c) Because the lower portion of the craft is being pulled more
forcefully than the top, the DIFFERENCE in these two forces has to be
compensated for by the craft's hul.  The greater the difference
in the forces, the more apt the craft is to be torn apart.  Any
astronaut falling into a black hole would experience the same stretching
and then be quickly ripped apart.  This phenomenon is referred to as a
tidal effect and is exactly the same principle in action as that for the
ocean tides that occur on Earth.

<p>The hull of the robot probe is capable of withstanding 1000 N of force
before being ripped apart.  Would the probe be destroyed at the altitude
given in (a) and (b)?  Explain.

<p>d) Determine how close the probe can get to
the hole without being destroyed. Use trial and error or a spreadsheet application, which might be the best approach. 


<p>*e) Given the first scenario in (b) above calculate the gravitational
force operating on the central section (5 m from top and bottom).  Draw
a free-body diagram that includes all three sections connected by two
cables (one between top and middle, and one between middle and bottom). 
Assume that the mass of the probe is distributed evenly between top, middle
and bottom.  Show that the tension in the two cables is equivalent to
the difference between the gravitational forces experienced by the top
and the bottom of the craft.</ul>
</ol>

<p>The crew launches a probe to the distance from the black hole that you
specified.  The robot safely returns to the Veracious, and as the results
of your study are radioed back to Earth, the crew celebrates
the completion of a mission thousands of years in the making.  In 10,000
years, the celebration will continue back on Earth when your data is
received.

<p>As a last experiment while orbiting the black hole, the crew sends a robot probe directly into the hole.  As it approaches the event
horizon, the boundary beyond which there is no return, the robot appears to
turn redder and redder in color.  Additionally, the radio signals of
data that it sends back to the Veracious exhibit longer and longer
wavelengths.  The relativity physicist explains that this red shift is
not completely explained by the fact that the probe is moving away from
the Veracious.  Most of the stretching of the wavelengths occurs because the
robot and radio signals are experiencing a slowing of time!  Analogous to
the slowing of time from movement at high velocities is a slowing
of time that occurs for objects in intense gravitational fields (like
near black holes).  The time of the robot relative to that of the Veracious is
slowing as it approaches the hole. The frequencies of light the probe is
emitting appear to the crew of the Veracious as lower in frequency and longer in
wavelength, hence the reddening color.

<p>Although as viewed from the Veracious, the probe appears redder and seems to talk a
lower and lower pitch, the probe notices nothing peculiar about its
own behavior.  It does, however, listen to the signals the Veracious is
sending it and finds that those signals are blue-shifted.  As it gets
closer and closer to the black hole, the probe sees that it is falling
ever faster into the hole.  If tidal forces don't rip the probe apart
first, the probe would, according to the robot's clock, within minutes
fall into the black hole to be lost forever.

<p>To the crew of the Veracious, the probe's color gets redder and redder as well as
dimmer and dimmer.  Finally, the probe would appear black as the light
from the probe, like all light from a black hole, is stretched in
wavelength to black.  Interestingly, if the crew members could see the probe
reach the edge of the black hole, they would see the probe stop and
never proceed into the black hole.  This is because at this point, the
probe's time is infinitely short relative to the Veracious--time has
effectively stopped.

<p>Such is the strange world of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.
