            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
              many ways, the school system in America reminds one of Saturn's 
              rings: from far away, it looks ordered and beautiful, a testament 
              to the organizational powers at work in the system. But the minute 
              you get inside, what you see is the chaos of countless individual 
              pieces, some colliding, some moving together, some all knotted up. 
              And what are all the pieces doing ultimately - going in circles 
              of course! </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I've 
              already mentioned some of the serious problems in science education 
              in our schools -- those problems are, of course, only a tiny subset, 
              of the much larger problems confronting the entire educational system. 
              One legacy of our frontier past is that the US education scene consists 
              of many fiercely independent empires. Fifty states have different 
              rules and requirements; and there are 16,000 school districts in 
              the country, in many of which local school boards maintain their 
              own priorities and regulations with a grim determination. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This 
              means that innovation and improvement in one place often has little 
              chance of spreading. Even on the national level, there is little 
              push for consistent, progressive change. And - as can be seen from 
              the abysmally bland and ineffective K-12 textbooks - the system 
              strongly favors the lowest common denominator. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Our 
              Society expects our schools to do much more than merely teach our 
              students basic liberal knowledge. Today, we expect our schools to 
              fulfil many of the functions that were the province of the extended 
              family, of religious institutions, and of the community at large 
              just a few decades ago. As Peter Schrag wrote recently in The New 
              Republic, (Dec. 16, 1991, p. 20): "No country has ever done, or 
              even tried, what this country is now trying: To take such a diverse 
              population of children -- 20% of them from below the poverty level, 
              many of them speaking little English, many from one parent or no-parent 
              families -- and educate each child at least through the 12th grade... 
              [Now add to this] what we've learned about the school's external 
              problems -- poverty, broken families, teenage pregnancies, drugs, 
              lack of health care, lack of child care..." </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
              1990, Bruce Alberts, now the head of the National Academy, wrote 
              poignantly about high school science teachers in California: Such 
              a teacher might typically teach five classes a day, with three different 
              preparations with a total of more than 160 students. A dedicated 
              teacher, with labs, setup, preparation, grading, student conferences, 
              and all the paperwork schools require, will work something like 
              70 hours a week, and have an average starting salary of $22,500 
              per year. Who would want this job? Or who, once having this job, 
              would not be tempted to cut corners, give lots of rote assignments, 
              skimp on hands-on lab experience, and just try to survive? ["Agenda 
              for Excellence" in the Journal of NIH Research, Apr. 1990, p. 19.] 
              </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> During 
              the school year 1993-94, (at the same time that the starting salary 
              for teachers was $22,500 on average) the average overall teachers' 
              salary in the U.S. was $35,958 [NEA: Estimates of School Statistics 
              (1994).] If we really felt that education is important in the U.S., 
              would we pay teachers so much less compared to lawyers, accountants, 
              business leaders? Why, in a culture that glorifies money, are we 
              surprised when students (especially students from low-income families) 
              get the message early on -- teaching and learning must not be so 
              important to adults, or film stars and basketball players would 
              not earn outrageously more than a mentor teacher. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> And, 
              despite our expectations of them, schools in our country cannot 
              by themselves solve all the problems that threaten the education 
              of young people. If we really want to make changes in the ways our 
              children are educated, we must be prepared to examine the other 
              influences on their lives as well. For some children, these include 
              poverty, violence, drugs, neglect, ill health, and lack of proper 
              housing. But even for children growing up in economically and emotionally 
              stable environments, there is a pernicious influence that was much 
              discussed as a problem when I was growing up, but today seems to 
              be treated mainly with resignation Š television . </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A 
              typical student in the US spends about 900 hours a year in school 
              and between 1200 and 1800 hours in front of a television set. In 
              1993, the average US household had a television set on for about 
              8 hours per day. And what does a youngster learn from commercial 
              television? More often than not, they gather the exact opposite 
              of what we try to teach them in school:<br>
              </font></p>
            <p> </p>
            <ul>
              <li> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That 
                the only thing that matters is the instant gratification of every 
                urge ("just do it," as the popular slogan says). </font> 
              <li> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That 
                what counts in America is money, celebrity, and fun. </font> 
              <li> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That 
                anything can be true and can happen (and that anecdotal evidence 
                is enough to prove any assertion.) </font> 
            </ul>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Think 
              of how teachers are shown on most television programs on the commercial 
              services: mostly as objects of derision. And how are scientists 
              usually portrayed (when they are shown at all)? Mostly as evil villains, 
              or naive agents of serious catastrophe that result from their experiments 
              getting out of control. These "lessons" of television viewing are 
              rarely lost on our students! </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Before 
              leaving the disquieting arena of K-12 education, let me turn just 
              briefly to the places where so many of our teachers are trained 
              - our schools of education. In the 20th century, the US has evolved 
              a whole slew of specialized schools and departments for preparing 
              our teachers. In many of these programs, you do not need to take 
              any science (and certainly any physical science) to become an elementary 
              level teacher. It is one of the few majors that do not have such 
              a requirement, which means it actually selects out those people 
              who are afraid of science. This is one reason why so many elementary 
              teachers transmit a fear, a hostility, a shudder at the very mention 
              of science to their young students, at just the time when kids' 
              minds are seeking not just information but values. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Estimates 
              are that more than 2/3 of math and science teachers in the US today 
              do not meet the recommended proficiency standards of their own professional 
              associations (Beardsley, T. "Teaching Real Science" in Scientific 
              American, Oct. 1992, p. 98.) But, especially in the higher grades, 
              the problem is not that teachers do not know enough science. The 
              problem is more often that the schools of education, despite their 
              many courses on teaching technique, rarely prepare teachers to present 
              science the way it should be taught -- in ways the students, at 
              their own stages of reasoning, are ready to understand. So science 
              teachers often model their teaching of science on how they learned 
              science, in big college lecture courses, from textbooks full of 
              facts to be memorized. No wonder 11-year olds get turned off when 
              science is presented to them in this way! </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Now 
              some schools of education in this country do make a valuable effort 
              to train teachers in the value of science and its most effective 
              presentation. But as long as schools of education remain separate 
              "fiefdoms" from the departments of science at our universities, 
              and as long as these programs continue to allow teachers to graduate 
              without proper grounding in the method and teaching of science, 
              our children will continue to have role models whose own attitudes 
              toward science would be charitably described as luke-warm. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
              1983 the National Commission on Excellence in Education published 
              A Nation at Risk, a report that decried state of education in the 
              U.S. It called the "rising tide of mediocrity" a "peril to our very 
              future as a nation and a people." It compared what was happening 
              in our schools to an act of war, except it was an act we had declared 
              on ourselves. The report (and others like it) made many recommendations, 
              but so far there have been few effective follow-ups and few additional 
              resources for waging this hidden war. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> No 
              amount of teacher training in science will address the fundamental 
              problems of low pay, low morale, and student overwhelmed by life 
              that confronts teachers in so many schools. We as a country must 
              confront those issues, and yet I am very pessimistic about the will 
              or the ability of our elected leaders to do so. This is why many 
              leaders in both science and education are now saying that the hope 
              of the future is for scientists (and other educated citizens) to 
              get personally involved in local and national efforts to reform 
              science education. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
              astronomy, such efforts include the A.S.P.'s <a href="../astro/project_astro.html">Project 
              ASTRO</a>, and its "Universe in the Classroom" program with workshops 
              and materials for teachers in grades 3-12; the A.A.S.' A-ASTRA project 
              training mentor teachers in astronomy around the country; several 
              innovative programs in the Education Division at the Center for 
              Astrophysics, led by Phil Sadler; and others listed in my Catalog 
              of National Education Projects. But far more remains to be done 
              and there are not enough astronomers in the country to have much 
              of an effect on their own. Only by joining with other scientific 
              disciplines, and encouraging some meaningful changes in the cultures 
              of our universities, colleges, and research institutions, could 
              we even hope to make any headway in this area.</font></p>
