                The scientific approach for NABIR was developed with the assistance of a team of
                scientists and engineers from the national laboratories, and input from academic
                institutions and the private-sector R&D community.  Three considerations guided
                development of the program.  First, as summarized in the previous section "Legacy
                of the Cold War and DOE's Unique Set of Remediation Challenges," opportunities
                for applying bioremediation at DOE sites were identified, along with some of the
                unique remediation challenges faced by DOE.  Second, reports from nine recent
                assessments of R&D needs for bioremediation were reviewed, and subsequent
                discussions were held with some of the participants (see "Bioremediation Research
                Needs").  Finally, related R&D programs in DOE and other agencies were evaluated
                to determine which R&D needs were not being met by the existing programs (see
                "Bioremediation and Related Programs in DOE" and "Bioremediation in Other
                Departments and Agencies").  NABIR is designed to fill these research gaps and
                complement other ongoing programs.<p>
                <h3>KEY THEMES OF THE NABIR
                PROGRAM</H3>
                
                
<HR>
The scientific approach of NABIR is characterized by several key ideas which
are highlighted and discussed below.<p>
<I>Fundamental research is required </I>to advance scientific understanding of
the biological, chemical, and physical processes important for natural and
                accelerated bioremediation.  Research is needed in many disciplines, such as
                microbiology, structural and molecular biology, genomics, geochemistry, and
                hydrology and transport processes.  But more importantly,
                interdisciplinary research involving two or more of these disciplines is
                likely to achieve breakthroughs in scientific understanding.  Finally,
                fundamental research should be focused on the behavior of complex
                systems that include mixtures of contaminants and multiple organisms,
                and this research must account for the natural spatial and temporal
                variability of geologic environments.<p>
                <I>Integration of scientific ideas across disciplines </I> is essential
                for development of the knowledge needed to predict and optimize
                bioremediation rates and processes.  An advance in any one aspect of
                bioremediation, such as development of microorganisms with enhanced
                degradative capabilities, is unlikely to make an impact unless other
                factors, such as how to introduce the microorganisms into the soil, are
                also improved.  Scientific advances in many key aspects of
                bioremediation must be coordinated and integrated at every step of the
                way.<p>
                <hr><h4><i>Overcoming the traditional walls that inhibit integration of
                disciplines is one of the keys to the success of NABIR.</i></h4><hr>
                <I>Field research centers </I> are the best vehicles for promoting and
                coordinating cooperation among research teams; identifying crucial
                fundamental, interdisciplinary research needs; achieving the integration
                described above; and focusing the research program on DOE's most
                significant problems.  In addition, performing research at a contaminated
                site will facilitate the two-way transfer of information needed to ensure
                that the scientific results of this program will be integrated into site
                remediation strategies.  Other opportunities, such as co-locating a
                bioremediation technology demonstration nearby, would allow for a host
                of synergistic interactions between technology development and
                fundamental research programs.  <p>
                <I>Access to R&D shared infrastructure </I> will be required to
                advance measurement and diagnostic techniques for understanding,
                quantifying, and enhancing biotransformation processes and rates. 
                Examples of the facilities required could include: <p>
                <menu>
                o    Dedicated beamlines and end stations at the DOE synchrotrons, e.g.,
                                     National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Stanford Synchrotron
                                     Radiation Laboratory (SSRL), Advanced Light Source (ALS),
                                     Advanced Photon Source (APS) for applications in metal speciation,
                                     crystallography, and structural biology.<p>
                o    High throughput sequencing facilities.<p>
                o    Analytical chemistry facilities, e.g., gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy
                                     (GC/MS), high-pressure liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (HPLC/MS).
                                     <p>
                o    Advanced methods for imaging such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
                                     (NMR) and high-resolution microscopy (e.g., confocal microscopes, electron
                                     microscopy).  <p>
                </menu>
                In addition to instrumentation, a set of shared computational models and shared
                strategies for mathematically representing and visualizing biogeochemical processes
                will be required.  Networks to efficiently link researchers to databases and models
                will facilitate rapid transfer of knowledge among the team and to other interested
                parties.  One of the first tasks of the program will be to develop a set of specific
                recommendations on the nature and location of scientific infrastructure needed to
                support this program.  Instrumentation and communication infrastructure needs will
                be evaluated on an ongoing basis, and recommendations will be made for developing
                new capabilities.<p>
                <I>The goals of the research program and the interrelationships between the
                goals of program elements must be clearly identified.</I>  In the following
                sections, the research program is described in terms of program goals at three, five,
                and ten years.<p>
                <I>Linkages to related research and technology development programs </I>
                will be established and maintained to ensure that NABIR builds on knowledge
                gained from other programs, fills in key gaps in scientific understanding, focuses on
                DOE's most important environmental problems, and leverages funds and shares
                resources when possible.  In particular, NABIR will work closely with OEM's
                Contaminant Plumes and Landfill focus teams to facilitate the seamless integration
                of knowledge between these complementary programs.<p>
                These themes will be implemented through the seven program elements shown in
                Fig. 3  and described below.<p>
                <H3>THE SEVEN PROGRAM ELEMENTS OF NABIR</H3>
                
                
<HR>
The NABIR program consists of seven interrelated program elements:<p>
<menu>
o               Biotransformation and Biodegradation <p>
o               Community Dynamics and Microbial Ecology <p>
o               Biomolecular Science and Engineering <p>
o               Biogeochemical Dynamics <p>
o               Assessment <p>
o               Acceleration <p>
o               System Integration, Prediction, and Optimization. <p>
</menu>
A schematic diagram illustrating the analysis and synthesis leading to selection of
the scientific program elements for NABIR is provided in Fig. 4, and detailed
supporting information derived from recent R&D needs assessments is provided in
Table 2. <p> 
The rationale for selecting these seven interrelated program elements is provided
below:<p>
<I>Biotransformation and Biodegradation.</I>  More knowledge is needed
about mechanisms and pathways for biotransformation and biodegradation,
especially for metals, radionuclides, and mixtures of contaminants.  Moreover, the
role of microbial consortia and how organisms work together to degrade or
transform contaminants must be understood better.<p><A HREF="./graphics/fig4.gif"align=bottom>

Table 2 (cont.).</a>  Bioremediation research and development needs as identified in recent
reviews and addressed by NABIR Program Plan (continued).<p>
<I>Community Dynamics and Ecology.  </I>More knowledge is needed to
understand  the composition, structure, and function of the large number of
organisms present in natural systems.  Advanced molecular and biochemical
methods should be applied to identify populations, evaluate evolution in response
to exposure to contaminants, and understand the influence of a variety of
environmental factors on biodegradation and biotransformation rates and processes. 
In addition, better understanding of the factors influencing the survival and
effectiveness of introduced organisms needs to be developed.<p>
<I>Biomolecular Science and Engineering.</I>  The potential of molecular
manipulation to enhance bioremediation remains untapped.  To realize this potential,
more information is needed to analyze genes, proteins, and regulatory elements of
critical molecules for bioremediation.  Knowledge of structure and function
relationships is also needed to understand the enzymatic mechanisms for
detoxification.  Building on this foundation, organisms could be engineered with
superior degradative capabilities.  However, ethical, legal, and social issues
associated with the development and utilization of engineered biodegradative
organisms must be addressed to the satisfaction of the public and regulatory
agencies before they can be used.<p>
<I>Biogeochemical Dynamics.</I>  Better methods are needed for measuring the
<I>in situ </I> distribution of organisms with potential for biodegradation, and for
understanding the environmental factors that control these distributions.  In addition,
the important role of interfaces as it affects the nature and rate of biogeochemical
processes needs to be understood better, especially the role of solid-liquid interfaces,
liquid-gas interfaces, and the interface between two immiscible liquids. 
Bioavailability of contaminants and nutrients is another key issue that must be better
understood.<p>
<I>Assessment.</I>  Advanced and real-time measurement tools are required to
understand and monitor the processes responsible for bioremediation and assessing
how effective they are.  Key needs include developing new methods for assessing
biodegradation rates and activities, developing noninvasive or minimally invasive
techniques for characterizing a site and monitoring loss of contaminants from the
site, developing diagnostic techniques for interpreting measurements, and
determining a scientifically defensible strategy for identifying bioremediation end
points.<p>
<I>Acceleration. </I> Better understanding of the factors that limit the rate of <I>
in situ </I> bioremediation is needed so that effective methods for accelerating
biogeochemical processes can be developed.  Better methods should be developed
for supplying nutrients and microorganisms for <I>in situ </I> bioremediation, and
for increasing the bioavailability of contaminants.  To achieve this, the underlying
transport processes need to be better understood, innovative biostimulation and
bioaugmentation methods as well as better methods for delivering acceleration
agents to the subsurface should be developed.<p>
<p><I>System Integration, Prediction, and Optimization. </I> More knowledge
is required to predict and optimize the effectiveness of bioremediation.  Mechanistic
models that quantitatively describe biotransformation and biodegradation processes,
community dynamics, and biogeochemical dynamics must be improved and then
linked together to develop engineering models for field-scale design, optimization,
and assessment of bioremediation.  Systems to integrate and disseminate new
information are also needed.<p>
Close coordination and interaction among researchers investigating topics in these
program elements will be required to overcome the traditional barriers to cross-fertilization and integration of knowledge and ideas.  The field research centers
described below, as well as information systems, shared models, and R&D shared
infrastructure will be the major vehicles for achieving this interaction.<p>
<H3>FIELD RESEARCH CENTERS</H3>

<HR>
There is broad agreement among the R&D community about the need for dedicated
research sites where the biogeochemical processes that contribute to bioremediation
can be investigated.  Field research centers will also be the vehicles for identifying
applied research needs. NABIR will establish three field research centers where such
site-based investigations can be carried out.  The field research centers will be
selected to address a range of hydrogeologic environments and contaminant mixtures
that are important to DOE.  The concept for operating these field research centers
is illustrated in Fig. 5.  The centers will support four types of activities:<p>
<menu>
1.              Small-scale, investigator-driven experiments related to community dynamics
                of soil microbiota and ecology, biotransformation and biodegradation
                processes, the survival and effectiveness of bioengineered organisms,
                biogeochemical dynamics, new methods of assessment, and acceleration
                strategies.<p>
2.              Large-scale interdisciplinary assessment of the rates and processes influencing
                natural bioremediation.<p>
3.              Large-scale manipulative experiments where methods of accelerating
                bioremediation and the underlying scientific foundations can be evaluated..<p>

4.              Pilot-scale evaluation of manipulative methods of accelerating
                bioremediation.<p>

<A HREF="./graphics/fig5.gif"align=bottom>
Figure 5.</A> Field research center concept.<p>
                In addition, samples of soil, sediment, groundwater, and biota will be made available
                for researchers performing laboratory experiments.  Thus each field research center
                will offer the opportunity for iterative and synergistic laboratory and field-based
                research.  The ability to test hypotheses derived from either field or laboratory-based
                research in an iterative manner will make this program unique.<p>
                Selected scientific investigators will be asked first to participate in the
                characterization of all aspects of the field site, including: <p>
                <menu>
                o    Assessment of natural degradation and transformation processes <p>
                o    Evaluation of community dynamics and microbial ecology <p>
                o    Structure and function analysis of key bioremediative organisms <p>
                o    Evaluation of the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the microbial community,
                                     contaminant distribution, hydrogeologic settings, and environmental factors.<p>
                </menu>
                Building on the characterization activities, concepts for accelerating bioremediation
                rates will be tested in the laboratory and, if successful, used for pilot or field-scale
                evaluation.  <p>
                At each field research center, experimental work will proceed in the three phases
                illustrated in Fig. 6 and described below.  Development of the three field research
                centers will be staged over the first four years of the program.  The location of the
                first field research center will be selected in the first year of the program.<p>

                                The focus of Phase I, scheduled over the first two years, will be to <p>

                o    Develop infrastructure support.<p>

                o    Initiate additional site and biogeochemical characterization of the site (to be
                                     continued in Phases II and III in parallel with field experiments).<p>

                provided in the "Program Management, Partnerships, and Implementation Plan"

                <H3>STRATEGIES FOR SCIENTIFIC INTEGRATION</H3>
                
                
<HR>
One of the major scientific challenges facing bioremediation is that its development
for the solution of complex environmental problems requires an interdisciplinary
approach.  Successful bioremediation requires information from technical specialists
such as microbiologists, hydrogeologists, geochemists, and engineers and
nontechnical factors such as the public, land-use planners, and manufacturers. 
Overcoming the traditional walls between these disciplines is one of the keys to the
success of NABIR. <p>
NABIR will employ several strategies to achieve the integration of the scientific
research activities:<p>
<menu>
1.              The field research centers will be a major vehicle for integrating research
                activities and promoting cooperation among research teams.  Databases
                containing a wide variety of site-specific information will be shared, and large-scale experiments will be jointly conceived, designed, and implemented by
                multiple investigators.<p>
2.              Scientific projects teams that include a variety of disciplines will be
                encouraged to submit proposals to the program.  Proposals submitted by
                individual investigators will be integrated into larger programs involving a
                number of investigators.  The peer-review process will be designed to facilitate
                formation of these teams.<p>
3.              The System Integration, Prediction, and Optimization program element will
                support projects to develop computational models that describe the dynamic
                interaction among microbial, geochemical, and hydrogeological processes. 
                Participation of scientists from many disciplines and research projects will be
                required to achieve this goal.  Engineers will be involved in scaling up these
                models to develop tools that accurately incorporate these processes but can
                also be used to design, optimize, and evaluate full-scale bioremediation
                efforts.<p>
4.              Through the use of shared R&D infrastructure, information flow will occur
                rapidly as new experimental data is gathered and interpreted.<p>
5.              Research projects that include investigators from more than one discipline will
                be favored over those involving only one discipline.<p>
6.              Regular scientific and public forums will be held where the results of research
                in progress can be shared among the research community and include
                technology developers and those involved in technology transfer.  These will
                stimulate rapid exchange of ideas and help keep the project focused on the
                most important scientific issues.<p>
