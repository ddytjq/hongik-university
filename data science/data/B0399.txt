					</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica">The year 2001 saw the assets of the Society exceed &pound;300 million for the first time. This was achieved following a period of controlled and sustained growth. The increase is complemented by a financial position that has seen both the Society's gross and free capital ratios continue to strengthen.<br>
						<br>
					</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#cc0066" size="2">Business Results</font><br>
					<font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica">The Society's mortgage business increased significantly during the year. The strategic decisions on product pricing, introduction of daily interest charging across the mortgage book, the removal of insurance tie-ins on product sales and the Society's early redemption policy all contributed to this success.<br>
						<br>
					</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica">These measures have had a planned impact on profitability. Group pre-tax profits being marginally reduced but only serving to evidence the Society's commitment to mutuality.<br>
						<br>
					</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica">The mortgage book continues to perform well with a reduction in arrears balances over the year.  The Society maintains a prudent approach both to arrears management and provisioning for potential bad and doubtful debts.<br>
						<br>
					</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica">Performance in the retail savings sector has remained strong during the year.  Share balances have increased in line with the target set of 5.5% increasing balances to &pound;270.6M.  The Society ensures that within its investment product range a fair rate of interest is applied to all accounts.<br>
						<br>
					</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica">During the year a review of general insurance business was commenced acknowledging that the insurance market is the subject of constant change.  Product benefits, together with an appraisal of characteristics and price, received detailed consideration. <br>
						<br>
					</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica">The activities of the Society's subsidiaries continued to play a supporting role during the course of the year.</font><br>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#cc0066" size="2">Moving Forward</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><br>
						</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The corporate planning process clearly defined the Society&#x2019;s objectives for 2001.  The plan focused on the core business areas of mortgages and savings, the extension of distribution channels, a review of business processes and the commitment to a strategy which maintained an appropriate balance between mutuality and profitability.  These objectives have served the Society well within the context of the many challenges faced during the year.  Responding to the dynamics of an ever changing financial market, developing enhanced services for members, maintaining financial strength and delivering improved efficiency have typified the year.<br>
							<br>
							The objectives set for 2002 will develop this strategy further.<br>
						</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#cc0066" size="2">Lending</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><br>
						</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica">Lending performance during the year has been very satisfactory. Gross lending increased to &pound;56M from &pound;33M in 2000. This represents a 70% increase on the previous year, a record for the Society.<br>
						</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica">Ability to match the product offered by the Society to market requirements has seen the Marsden's appearance in a number of 'best buy tables' throughout the year providing an opportunity to extend business activity.<br>
							<br>
							The increased lending performance has been achieved within the terms set by the Society's lending policy. The prudent criteria set should reduce exposure to future risks.<br>
							<br>
							The requirements of existing borrowers are also considered.  Each one has the benefit of the daily interest charge applied from 1st January 2001.<br>
							<br>
							Commercial customers are also of importance to the Society.  The Marsden operates a dedicated commercial lending function specialising in finance for residential development and commercial property loans.  Commercial lending during the year totalled &pound;13M.<br>
						</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#cc0066" size="2">Funding</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><br>
						</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica">The Society's policy of paying appropriate rates of interest across the range of retail savings products has ensured that the funds necessary to uphold lending activity are available. During the year the number of new investment accounts opened was 8,575, a significant figure. Virtually all of these accounts were opened within branch offices confirming the importance of these outlets within the Society's operation.<br>
							<br>
							The Society reviews regularly the product portfolio to ensure that interest rates are competitive within the sector.<br>
							<br>
							The Society's mortgage funds continue to be sourced from members occasionally complemented by wholesale funding which can be arranged swiftly by the Society's treasury management team.<br>
						</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#cc0066" size="2">Distribution<b><br>
							</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The Society is committed to providing a service to members through the branch network. The branches continue to represent an important channel for delivering the personal 'face to face' service to members at a time when such facilities have reduced still further across the region.<br>
							<br>
							Changes in the regulatory and compliance environment have given rise to further rationalisation of the agency network. During the year the Society's agency in Accrington closed by mutual consent following a long and productive relationship. Alternative arrangements have been offered to all members affected.<br>
							<br>
							The personal approach to product sales underpinned by effective administrative support is at the base of the Society's relationship with its customers. The Society's systems are constantly reviewed to support changes within the sales process.<br>
						</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#cc0066" size="2">Regulation</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><br>
						</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica">Over the past twelve months the Society has completed the transition to a new regulatory environment under the Financial Services Authority.  The change took place on 1st December 2001 following a period of intensive preparation. <br>
							<br>
							During the year the Society became a member of the General Insurance Standards Council.  GISC is an independent organisation which regulates sales advice and service standards of its members.<br>
							<br>
							The Society continues its membership of the banking code and mortgage code.<br>
						</font><br>
						<font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica">New money laundering regulations became effective during the year.  Any member opening a new account with the Society will have appreciated the impact of these procedures.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#cc0066" size="2">Business Process</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><br>
						</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">During the year the Society introduced a new mortgage applications system continuing its investment in the technology at the heart of the Society's operational infrastructure. The new system incorporates a mortgage illustration system which together with a new mortgage processing system through branch centres is aimed at increasing operational efficiency. The objective is to ensure that all aspects of the Society's operations are able to handle business in an efficient compliant and timely manner. The changes made have contributed to a small increase in administrative expenses during the year.</font><br>
					</p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#cc0066" size="2">Community<b><br>
							</b></font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica">The Marsden is a key employer locally within the financial sector and is working hard to develop its business across the North West.  The branch offices provide a framework for linking involvement with local communities, together with marketing support for a range of local initiatives.<br>
							<br>
							The Society has supported a number of national fund raising activities by acting as a collection point for public donations through these offices.<br>
						</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#cc0066" size="2">Staff</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2"><br>
							The impact of ever increasing regulation and the increase in the Society's mortgage lending has made 2001 a year of significant activity. The hard work and commitment of staff members in achieving the targets set has been a very important factor in the progress made.</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"><br>
							<br>
						</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica" color="#cc0066" size="2">Summary</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2"><br>
							The ability to compete effectively in the future will demand even greater efficiencies within our business operation and a reduction in the cost base wherever possible.<br>
							<br>
							All aspects of the business are kept under constant review supported by a determination to remain a strong but effective mutual organisation.</font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica"><br>
