<H3>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES</h3>

                <hr>
                To integrate scientific concepts and data from different program elements and to
                develop a hierarchy of improved mathematical methods for describing coupled
                biological, geochemical, geological, and transport processes.  These methods will
                be used, together with visualization techniques, to design and interpret laboratory
                and field experiments, to establish bioremediation design principles, to predict
                and optimize the effectiveness of bioremediation under many different conditions,
                and to identify and quantify the largest sources of uncertainty.  The overall goal
                is to synthesize this information so that the effectiveness of bioremediation at
                sites with complex contaminant mixtures can be predicted and optimized.  Further,
                bioremediation strategies can be compared with conventional remediation through a
                cost-benefit analysis.<p>
                <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
                
                
<hr>
Knowledge gained in the scientific disciplines of microbiology, hydrology, and
geochemistry provides a strong scientific foundation for bioremediation.  However,
the effectiveness of bioremediation cannot yet be predicted with a high degree of
confidence for complex contaminant mixtures and heterogeneous geology (Miller and
Poindexter, 1994).  A key component in the inability to make accurate predictions
is the lack of a robust understanding of the dynamics that interrelate biological,
hydrological, and geochemical processes as well as the quantitative tools needed
to synthesize them.  Examples of such coupled or interrelated phenomena include the
correlation among local geochemistry, moisture variation, and biological
activities; the dependence of biological activities on soil chemistry and fluid
advection and dispersion; and the transient processes involving water recharge,
nutrient transport, biological activity, chemical transformation, and migration of
products from biological activities (AgBiotech, 1991; Alfoldi, 1991).  These
activities are further complicated by the heterogeneity or variability of the
physical, chemical, and biological properties of natural systems.  Advances in
understanding the relationship of such activities and in dealing with
heterogeneities will provide the foundations for predicting and improving the
effectiveness of existing bioremediation technologies and for developing new and
innovative ones.<p>
<hr><h4><i>The effectiveness of bioremediation cannot yet be predicted with a high
degree of confidence for complex contaminant mixtures and heterogeneous geology.</i></h4><hr>
Because of the multidisciplinary nature of the program, there will be a diversity
of scientific data (biological, chemical, geological, etc.). 
Fortunately there have been many efforts in recent years on databases
and informatics.  These will be used to support rapid evolution of data
and information from the program elements to promote the sharing of data
among projects and with the larger scientific community.<p>
<h3>APPROACH</H3>

<HR>
The System Integration, Prediction, and Optimization element will
develop strategies to represent mathematically the key microbial,
biotransformation, and biogeochemical processes identified in other
program elements, and to identify, adapt, or develop where necessary
predictive models (including statistical models) that can design and
interpret laboratory and field-scale experiments for intrinsic and
enhanced bioremediation.  In parallel, an information system will be
developed to facilitate the synthesis of experimental data gathered by
the program at one site, preferably using existing software where
feasible.  The final products of this program element are expected to
include predictive models that have been successfully tested and that
can be used to design and interpret laboratory and field-scale
experiments for intrinsic and enhanced bioremediation.<p>
To address the need for systematic methods of integrating biological,
geochemical, geological, and transport processes associated with
contaminant mixtures in complex geologic systems, research will focus
on three areas: <p>
<menu>
1.              <b>Scientific Data Integration and Informatics.</b>  In order to
                support  the synthesis of data from various program elements, it
                will be necessary to identify (or develop) information systems
                which can support diverse scientific data, including biochemical,
                molecular biology, metabolic, geochemical, and microbiological.<p>
2.              <b>Mathematical Representation of Community Dynamics,
                Biotransformation, and Biogeochemical Processes. </b> Develop new
                mathematical and statistical methods for the mechanistic
                representation of community dynamics, ecology, biotransformation,
                and biogeochemical processes.<p>
3.              <b>Integrative and Scalable Models.</b>  Develop a hierarchy of
                improved, coupled dynamic models that integrate, predict, and
                optimize these processes in many different environments using improved
                mathematical and statistical methods.  This could include the adoption or
                development of software tools to support model development and model
                management. <p>
</menu>
These research activities will build on information gained from all program
elements and will be essential for interpreting phenomena observed in complex
natural systems.  At any time, the integrated models and associated databases will
represent the current state of knowledge and will be available for predicting
optimal bioremediation strategies for a given site and site conditions and for
comparing bioremediation strategies with conventional remediation methods through
a cost-benefit analysis. <p>

                To enhance or develop mathematical (numerical and statistical)
                representations of microbial community dynamics, biodegradation,

Models</H3><P>
<I>Fundamental research on mathematical (numerical and statistical) models to simulate
integrated bioremediation processes in soils and geologic formations, accounting for biological,
chemical, and physical variabilities.</I><P>
<h4>Objectives</h4>

                <hr>
                Enhance or develop predictive computational and statistical models for
                designing, integrating, and evaluating laboratory and field
                experiments.  Develop inversion methods to obtain parameter estimates
                from field and laboratory experiments.  Obtain or develop improved

                A three-tier hierarchy of models will be constructed, with systematic
                methods linking results from one model to another.  The first set of
                models will predict bench-scale biodegradation and biotransformation
                rates in complex subsurface environments contaminated with contaminant
                mixtures.  The second set will focus on the coupling between <I>in
                situ</i> transport processes and biotransformation and biodegradation at a scale
                that captures the relevant biogeochemical processes and heterogeneities of natural
                environments.  The third set will focus on the engineering calculations needed to
                implement and optimize bioremediation on a field scale.  These models will include
                a strong statistical component to account for biological and chemical variabilities
                as a function of both space and time.  Equally important to developing the models
                is the design of the scaling-up concepts and processes that will link them
                together.  Once the models are successfully tested, they will be made available to
                the environmental bioremediation industry. <P>
