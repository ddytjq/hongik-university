We have developed an astronomical imaging system that incorporates a total of
eight 2048x2048 pixel CCDs into two focal planes, to allow simultaneous
imaging in two colors. Each focal plane comprises four ``edge-buttable"
detector arrays, on custom Kovar mounts. The clocking and bias voltage levels
for each CCD are independently adjustable, but all the CCDs are operated
synchronously. The sixteen analog outputs (two per chip) are measured at 16
bits with commercially available correlated double sampling A/D converters. The
resulting 74 MBytes of data per frame are transferred over fiber optic links
into dual-ported VME memory. The total readout time is just over one minute. We
obtain read noise ranging from 6.5 to 10 electrons for the various channels
when digitizing at 34 Kpixels/sec, with full well depths (MPP mode) of
~100,000 electrons per 15 micron by 15 micron pixel. This instrument is
currently being used in a search for gravitational microlensing from 
compact objects in our Galactic halo, using the newly refurbished 
1.3 m  telescope at the Mt. Stromlo Observatory, Australia.
