<P><STRONG>Where can I find documentation for using DirectX with Visual Basic ?</STRONG></P>
<P>This documentation is part of the DirectX SDK documentation you'll find (either online or
as a download) at http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/. Using the "L" in the upper left corner,
you can filter parts relevant to your target language (C++ or Visual Basic).
Though you may benefit from other materials, you'll really need this one.</P>
<P><STRONG>How Visual Basic compares with a C/C++ application ?</STRONG></P>
<P>The type library support provides access to the <STRONG>same</STRONG> DirectX objects as those used by a C or C++ programmer. The <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/developer/information/vb.asp" target="_top">DirectX for Visual Basic</A> support provided by Microsoft starting with DirectX 7, uses a thin wrapper that could give a slight performance hit (someone reported 5 %). Now Visual Basic can compile to native code and you should really see a very slight, if any, performance hit compared with a C or C++ application. Also most of the time, at least for a simple application, is spend by the DirectX engine rather than in your Visual Basic code (and the situation is in fact very similar to calling a SQL database engine). However, it's probably fair to recognize that using C, C++ can become handy for complex algorithms, especially when having to deal with memory. Note that you can call an <A href="../../assembly.htm">assembly</A> routine, even from Visual Basic.  Update : DirectX 8.0 now includes pixel and vertex processing capabilites allowing to perform operations at the pixel or vertex level through the DirectX API.</P>
<P><STRONG>How do I use DirectDraw in DirectX 8 ?</STRONG></P>
<P>Though DirectX 8 still provides DirectX 7.0 DirectDraw interfaces, DirectDraw is not updated in DirectX 8. For 2D applications you can :
<UL>
<LI>Keep using DirectDraw in DirectX 7
<LI>The current trend is to use Direct3D for 2D apps as 2D is just a particular case and it allows also to benefit from all Direct3D capabilities (alpha blending, filtering, bitmap rotation...) without duplicating all. You can do so by using the new <CODE>D3DXSprite</CODE> class or by using TLVertices as shown in the Visual Basic "Donuts" sample.
</UL>
DirectDraw <STRONG>hardware specific</STRONG> (such as overlays) features are expected to be back in DirectX 9 but it's probably unlikely to see a 2D programming model (that would be implemented anyway by calls to a 3D pipeline).</P>
<H2>DirectDraw</H2>
<P><STRONG>I'm using RGB to specify a color key but it doesn't work unless it is black</STRONG></P>
<P>DirectDraw doesn't use RGB color coded values but the actual value stored in the card
video memory. Information about the video memory layout is available through the 
DirectDrawSurface7.GetPixelFormat method.</P>
<P><STRONG>How do I use the DDBLT_ROTATION flag ?</STRONG></P>
<P>This capability is not emulated in software and no known hardware offers this capability.
You'll have either to do this in software (likely using a third party library such as the
Intel Image Processing Library) or use Direct3D (textured rectangle).</P>
<P><STRONG>How to achieve alpha blending (translucency) in DirectDraw ?</STRONG></P>
<P>Once again, this is not supported in DirectDraw. You'll have either to do this in software
or to use Direct3D. Note that Direct3D allows also to use any other Direct3D capabilities for your 2D application. Actually, it is expected that most 2D non specific tasks will use the 3D hardware pipeline and that DirectDraw will finally expose only 2D specific hardware features (such as video overlays...)</P>
<H2>Direct3D Retained Mode</H2>
<P><STRONG>What is the status of Direct3D Retained Mode ?</STRONG></P>
<P>Though still included in upcoming DirectX releases, Direct3D Retained Mode is not updated
any more and should be considered as "deprecated". DirectX 8 includes easy replacements for
most if not all, Direct3D Retained Mode capabilities.</P>
