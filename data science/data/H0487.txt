<P>
This spring's SFI Science Board Symposium took as its theme "Scientific Models:
Claiming and Validating." The goal was to address the question-in the context of
specific social, biological, and physical systems-of what can be "claimed" for a
model that has been constructed to describe that system.
</P>
<P>
The symposium consisted of three talks and general discussions, and while they
weren't chosen to exemplify Katchalsky's aphorism quoted above, they might as
well have been.<IMG SRC="images/tapes.gif" ALT="A perspective view of the alpha3 gamma" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE="6" VSPACE="0">

<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#5511CC" face="helvetica, ariel"><B>The World's Smallest Rotary Motor</B></FONT>

<P>
SFI Science Board member George Oster, a professor of biology at UC Berkeley, led
off the program with a talk on "The World's Smallest Rotary Motor." The general
issue addressed by Oster's work is how cells turn chemical energy into mechanical
force, and, in particular, how the protein ATP synthase pulls off the trick.
</P>
<P>
To begin with, what does ATP synthase do? Principally, it synthesizes ATP
(adenosine triphosphate) from ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and phosphate. ATP is
then used as the energy source for almost all cellular reactions. (This is why
ATP synthase is sometimes billed as "the most important protein in the universe,"
a description Oster modestly admits "may not be entirely hype.") In short, it is
an important and ancient protein, so "if any molecule has been optimized by
evolution, this is it."
</P>


<P><IMG SRC="images/motor.gif" ALT="Side View of the FO motor" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE="6" VSPACE="0">
The ATP synthase has two components, F0 and F1. The first, F0, deals with proton
gradients; the second, F1, with the synthesis of ATP. Each can act as a "rotary
motor," the pair of them being connected by a shaft, giving the whole affair the
look of a lollipop on an ornamental stand. Physicists like Oster are conditioned
to associate the notion of "engine" with "heat" since they are drilled from the
start to tackle motors as problems in thermodynamics. When one measures the
efficiency of the synthase, however, it turns out to be over 90 percent, with no
temperature gradients worth mentioning. ATP synthase certainly cannot be a heat
engine, and so physicists need to consider it in a new way.
</P>
<P>
What is of great interest is the way the structural biologists have gone over ATP
synthase atom by atom in its different conformations. Very detailed simulations
of molecular dynamics show that, while there's a lot of jitter, the important
conformational changes of proteins can be decomposed into shearing motions and
hinged bending motions. Using this information, and the known detailed structure
of ATP synthase, Oster was able to write down a very simple model-a "tinker-toy
model"-for the mechanical and elastic properties of the synthase, incorporating
only those hinges and shears. The tinker-toy is only for illustration; the real
model is a set of mechanical equations, fairly straight-forwardly deduced from
Newton's laws, in which drag is opposed by stochastic, ultimately chemical
driving forces.
</P>
<P>
The solutions of these equations are in agreement with experiment, qualitatively
and quantitatively. Moreover, when run in reverse-when provided with outside
torque, and used to either synthesize ATP or build up a proton gradient-the
equations again are in quantitative agreement with experiment. This is, as Bob
May said in the discussion afterwards, "mathematical biology at its best."
</P>
<P>
Two related evolutionary issues occupied that discussion, with lively input from
Murray Gell-Mann, Stuart Kauffman, Philip W. Anderson, George Lakoff, and Harold
Morowitz, among others. The first was the optimality of ATP synthase. There is
extraordinarily little variance in the protein across species-you can take parts
from E. coli, and parts from cows, and put them together to get a working
protein. This, together with its very high mechanical efficiency, suggests that
ATP synthase is about as good as proteins working on its general lines can get;
but we can't rule out the possibility of a radically different design which works
as well as the actual one.
</P>
<P>
The second issue was whether those specific ways of functioning are the only way
of doing ATP synthase's job. Partly this depends on how many different ways there
are to do exactly the same job as ATP synthase (nobody knows; but Oster said
there are known to be workable alternatives to the designs of some other
molecular motors) and how many ways there are to change that job by tweaking
other aspects of biochemistry, e.g. by using something other than ATP.
</P>


<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#5511CC" face="helvetica, ariel"><B>Punctuated Equilibria in Physics, Biology and Economics</B>
</FONT>

<P>
"Punctuated equilibrium" is a phrase coined by paleontologists Steven Jay Gould
and Niles Eldredge to describe a pattern they saw in the fossil record-a pattern
of species remaining pretty much unchanged for long periods of time, and then
going through a (geologically) brief spurt of change.
</P>
<P>
Per Bak, of the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen,  believes he can see this
pattern in many places other than the fossil record, and even give it a
mathematical characterization. The signatures of punctuated equilibrium, he says,
are, first, a power-law distribution of event sizes (suitably defined) where
there is no characteristic size for events, but the number of events over a
certain size is inversely proportional to some power of that size.
</P>
<P>
The second sign he calls "1/f noise," where, again, events are distributed over
all time-scales, but the power or size of events is inversely proportional to
some power of their frequency; really big changes are rare, but not exponentially
so. Finally, he claimed that punctuated equilibrium involves the assertion that
"catastrophic" events are internally generated, as opposed to being the effects
of external causes, like large rocks falling from the sky.
</P>

<P>
Power laws are well-established for some phenomena like the strengths of
earthquakes and extinction rates, and, more controversially, for prices of stocks
and other securities. (If it is true that changes in securities prices follow a
power law, and the power law shows that the changes are internally generated,
this undercuts one of the important traditional justifications for securities
markets, namely that they effectively pool and evaluate all the available
external information about the true worth of commodities and companies.) Acting
on the assumption that punctuated equilibria are common, it is natural-at least
for a physicist-to ask about a "general mechanism" which will produce them, one
for which "the details don't matter."
</P>

<P>
Bak suggests that this general mechanism is to be found in statistical physics's
notion of the critical point, at the boundary between two radically different
states (for instance, between liquid water and steam, where the critical point is
100 degrees centigrade at sea level, and noticeably lower in Santa Fe). At
critical points, the response to perturbations can (Bak says) be extremely
nonlinear, and the power-law distributions and 1/f noise depend on this.  In
fact, power-laws are generically found in physical systems close to the critical
point. What Bak has proposed are models which are not just critical, but
"self-organized critical."
</P>
<P>
Instead of needing to have parameters (like temperature and pressure) tuned to
get them to the critical point, their own dynamics will take them there, keeping
them in stable but critical condition. "You cannot make a realistic model of
California to explain earthquakes" -so simple models will have to do. One of the
very simplest models which exhibits self-organized criticality is the so-called
"sandpile" model, where we imagine ourselves to be dribbling sand from above onto
a small pile. Friction between the grains can balance gravity only up to a
certain slope, so we imagine that, when enough sand has built up at one location
to exceed that slope, it shifts to some down-hill locations. If these are already
near the critical slope, sand will flow from them as well, and so on, generating
an avalanche. All of this can be formalized with two or three rules and just
integer values for the height. This displays all the power laws (avalanche size,
time between avalanches at a site, etc.) one could want, the 1/f power spectrum,
and so forth.
</P>
<P>
Now, what makes us think that this toy model can teach us anything about the
real-world systems with similar statistical features? Bak answers: "Our intuition
from physics." There, powerful mathematical methods have established that many
properties (including the power-laws) are the same for all critical systems in
the same "universality class," regardless of their detailed physical
construction. This being so, we use the simplest model in the right universality
class, since trickier, more realistic models give no more "insight into the type
of beast we are dealing with."
</P>
<P>
So, what does Bak say falls within the universality class of this "theorist's
sand"? Well, actual granular materials (at least sometimes-depending on physical
details, like the ratio of the length of the grains to their width); earthquakes,
as described by a simple mechanical model with "stick-slip" motion; evolution,
where avalanches get mapped onto extinctions, and the different sites of the
sandpile model to different species; and the actions of many separate traders on
the stock-market, where each trader is mapped onto a different site, and
avalanches are waves of buying or selling a certain stock.
</P>

<P>
The discussion following Bak's presentation was wide-ranging and heated, with Bob
May taking the lead in arguing against Bak.  The two most important issues were
those of external events and model construction. There is a strong consensus
among biologists that at least the five great mass extinctions were caused by
exogenous events-most notoriously, that at the end of the Cretaceous by a
meteorite impact.  A second point which was urged was that there are really very
many ways, many statistical mechanisms, which generate power-law distributions,
which would undermine the arguments about universality classes.
</P>

<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#5511CC" face="helvetica, ariel"><B>Banking Markets in Renaissance Florence</B>
</FONT>
<P>
As University of Chicago political scientist John Padgett said, "Banking Markets
in Renaissance Florence" is the "Florentine history" title for his presentation;
the Santa Fe Institute title would be "The Co-evolution of States and Markets." 
Padgett's heart is with the Florentine title. That is, he doesn't look at
Florence as a particular instance or test case of a general model of how states
and markets co-evolve. Rather he wants to understand that co-evolution "primarily
to understand Florence." The research began with the goal of understanding
political parties in Florence, and he was "driven by the state itself" to look at
the influence of markets on the politics, and of changes in the state on markets,
especially in banking.
</P>
<P>
There is a long and very well-established body of work on the relation between
markets and state structures, namely political economy, which Padgett accepts.
However, being largely about the effects of state policies on markets, it's
inapplicable to the present case. Not only was the Florentine state made up of
exactly the same people as its business firms, serving their few months in the
government of the republic, meaning that there was no distance, really, between
those who made policy and those affected by it, but political economy is silent
on the "constitution of social agents," the way agents (like firms or political
divisions) get built up, which is precisely what Padgett wants to know about.
</P>
<P>
When one examines the data from the records of the Florentine guilds, principally
that of the bankers, says Padgett, one can see four distinct kinds of firms-all
of them partnerships-succeeding each other in turn, and rather abruptly at that.
At the beginning of the 14th century partnerships were made within large,
patrilineal families, grew to great sizes, and competed with each other viciously
(e.g., conspiring on the city council to have business rivals exiled and their
property expropriated). These were followed by much smaller partnerships arranged
on guild and neighborhood lines, between masters and apprentices, pooling
together resources for large projects and all in all more "solidaristic"; then
"multi-divisional firms" where one businessman would join one partnership in
(say) wool, another partnership in silk, a third in banking proper, and so on;
and, finally, rentier firms, with a separation between owners and managers. In
each case the different organizational form was "socially embedded," each
"mobilized" a different sort of social raw material-first families, then guilds
and neighborhoods, then social classes and marriage alliances within them,
finally patron-client networks and political factions.
</P>
<P>
What Padgett set out to explain is why, since Florence at all these times had
families, guilds, social classes and factions, now one and then another of these
provided the raw material for building economic agents. The answer, "driven very
much by what I see in my data," is state formation. The lines along which firms
were formed were also the lines of division of Florentine politics. The advantage
of forming partnerships with political allies is that, first, you can have more
trust in your partner, and spend more time thinking about how to make money,
rather than about whether he's going to have you exiled or poisoned, and, second,
there are institutionalized recruitment channels-you can form a partnership with
your nephew or the person on the next street over or your brother-in-law, with
little effort at searching out a suitable candidate. Is this so? That is, do the
changes in organizational form track the changes in politics? It seems that they
do.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the period, Florentine politics was dominated by the rivalry
of the great families, and the shift from family to guild firms took place at the
same time as these elites seized control of the guilds. The shift to
"multi-divisional firms" coincided, not just with Florence becoming the mediator
for the whole European economy, but with "classic Marxian class warfare" as well.
The elites were exiled and expropriated, a worker's republic was set up, and when
the elites returned there were massacres in the streets, and, not surprisingly,
the inter-class partnerships of the guild period were gone. So it looks rather
like changes in market structure grew out of changes in organizational form,
which grew from changes in politics, and especially in changes in how the state
was constituted.
</P>


<P>
These changes in the state were, some of them, triggered by external crises, but
in what Padgett says is a "predictable" way. When the crises arrive, and
previously existing divisions (say, between families) are exacerbated, then
political actors mobilize some other network as an instrument in their struggle,
as an extra source of power. In time, these other networks move from being tools
to being identities, the things on which political divisions are based, and the
wheel is ready to turn again.
</P>

<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#5511CC" face="helvetica, ariel"><B>Reflections</B></FONT>
<P>
If the goal of this symposium was to show the diversity of the things which get
lumped together as "models," it succeeded, almost to excess. Both Oster and Bak
are, for instance, physical scientists trying to answer questions  of biology,
but in completely different ways. In Bak's work, the "details don't matter," as
he says, just the elucidation of a single, unifying general mechanism. Oster, on
the other hand, immerses himself in biological detail-not just the structural
studies which say where every single atom is, but knowledge of the function of a
single enzyme, and exceedingly detailed genetic work which enabled him to
identify key amino acids in a particular sub-unit. Padgett's work is something
else again, even more detail-dependent but without the formal, mathematical
structure of the physicists.
</P>
<P>
Some of the speakers professed to be mere slaves of their data, others confessed
to prolonged trial and error. Nobody said anything very original about how models
get built, or how they should be, and it was probably unreasonable to expect
otherwise-good musicians are rarely good musicologists. Validation for models
like Oster's is, in principle, straightforward: if it fits the known structure
and kinetics of the enzyme, and agrees quantitatively with experiment, then the
model does all it can be asked to do. Things are trickier for Padgett, since most
of the data which the model is supposed to fit were used in putting it together,
making agreement between the two less than compelling evidence in the model's
favor. But this is a common problem for historical hypotheses, and the solution
is new data, e.g., for guilds other than banking, or even cities other than
Florence; within this description of one state and one set of markets there is a
theory of states and markets in general hinting politely to be let out. (The
model would probably need to have some formal backbone put into it first, though,
rather than leaving it in its present verbal form.) It is not at all clear what validation would even begin to
look like for as all-encompassing and ambitious a notion as Bak's self-organized criticality. If it were the
only way to get certain statistical properties, and earthquakes, evolution, etc., showed those properties,
then that would be strong evidence that a SOC-like mechanism was at work; but it seems that there are
other ways of generating such distributions, which do not involve self-organized criticality (for instance,
the Newman-Sneppen model of extinction, where all extinctions are caused by exogenous stresses). The
only way of figuring out which mechanism is active in particular cases would seem to lie in studying the
details of that particular system, squashing the hope of finding general, details-independent mechanisms.
