      </div>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      </font><i>
      <p>by Paul D. Bayne</p>
      </i>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">KANKAKEE, Ill. (June 26) - Billy Moyer of
      Batesville, AR kept the Petroff Posse train rolling through Central
      Illinois Wednesday night, as he won for the third time in the UMP
      Summernationals 2002 tour. The win earned Moyer $10,000, and also marked
      the ninth time in the eleven events contested so far, that the Petroff
      Posse has captured the checkers. Shannon Babb of Decatur, IL and Don
      O'Neal of Martinsville, IN have each won four and two times, respectively.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Starting third on the grid, Moyer
      inherited the lead on lap five from polesitter Babb, who dropped out under
      caution with mechanical woes, then led the final 35 laps of the 40-lap
      event. Like Moyer has done so often in his career, he made it look easy.
      Almost to the point of becoming dull, and that's suits &quot;Mr.
      Smooth&quot; just nicely.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">When the green flag fell over the field of
      twenty-four including two late provisionals being awarded by UMP President
      Bob Memmer (Don O'Neal and Ed Dixon), it was Babb and Moyer who made a
      quick escape from the field. On lap six, four cars tangled in turn one
      including Mark Anderson, Jim Curry, and Ted Loomis. At that time, Babb
      pulled his machine off the track in turn two and was forced to call a
      night. With Babb sidelined, Moyer had his sights set on reclaiming the
      Summernationals points' lead once again. Dennis Erb Jr. of
      Carpentersville, IL held tough for much of the early going, but Moyer was
      too strong and consistent lap after lap.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Don O'Neal, currently fourth in
      Summernationals points, and Ed Dixon, currently fourth in national UMP
      points, were both added to the tail of the field as provisionals. O'Neal
      had charged his way up to eleventh by the lap five caution, while Bob
      Pierce, of Oakwood, IL, had moved to fifth after starting tenth. Loomis
      spun on the ensuing restart to bring the caution flag back out and offer
      Babb some extra time to repair what it was that forced him to pit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Scott Bloomquist had started to make a
      move on lap 17, when he went past Roger Long for the fifth spot.
      Bloomquist had started thirteenth on the grid. On lap 18, the youngster
      Justin Allgaier got out of shape in turn two, then had some assistance
      from Steve Hillard in moving the car safely to the infield. The result was
      a broken right front tie rod for the 16-year-old from Riverton, IL.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the halfway mark, Moyer held about a
      12-car length advantage over Erb Jr, followed by Kevin Weaver and Bob
      Pierce battling side-by-side for third, and Bloomquist in fifth. The four
      car battle for second between Erb Jr., Weaver, Pierce, and Bloomquist had
      the focus of the fans, as you could literally hide these four cars under a
      blanket. Back and forth, bumping and sliding they went for nearly ten
      laps. Pierce got by Weaver then moved past Erb Jr. for second on lap 25,
      while Bloomquist pushed Erb Jr. and Weaver back to fourth and fifth,
      respectively.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Pierce tried valiantly to close the gap on
      Moyer, but couldn't get the car hooked up on the bottom of turns one and
      two due to a large whole that had developed, sending cars bouncing wildly
      through the turns. At times the cars looked more like powerboats as they
      lunged through turn one.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">With ten laps remaining, Moyer had thing
      well in command, with Pierce in second, making no strides towards gaining
      on Moyer. Bloomquist, Erb Jr., and Weaver were all in the top five and
      running very smooth, while O'Neal, Bret Sievert, Long , Duke Whiseant, and
      Billy Drake rounding out the top ten. With just six laps to go, Bloomquist
      closed in on Pierce, and pulled alongside of &quot;The Tall Cool One&quot;
      one lap later. However, Pierce was able to hold off the winless Bloomquist
      to the stripe. &quot;I think we're about due to win one of these
      things,&quot; Bloomquist said prior to racing action. &quot;We had that
      one race won when the motor blew (Vermilion County), and despite that
      we're still knocking at the door. It's still a long road ahead,&quot; he
      added.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">By the time the checkered flag flew,
      Whiseant had moved around Long and Sievert for seventh, while Drake pushed
      Sievert back to ninth. Curry made his first appearance in the top ten in
      the closing laps after getting by Long, and holding off Jeep Van Wormer.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the four preliminary heat races, of
      which three would transfer from each, Shawn Toczek held off Jim Curry, and
      Joe Harlan in heat one. In heat two, Anderson held off Loomis, and Frank
      Heckenast. Heat three belonged to Long, over Bloomquist and Sievert. In
      the fourth and final heat, Bob Pierce bested Billy Drake, and Steve
      Hillard.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Two consolation races were run for those
      drivers not transferring through heat races,and those were won by Van
      Wormer over Whiseant, who endured a terrific race-long battle with O'Neal,
      and by Allgaier, who held off Tom Pauley and Ed Dixon.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dan Schlieper implemented a new design
      with sheet metal prior to the night's events, and it paid off somewhat.
      With the right rear quarter panel fold inwards at a ninety-degree angle,
      Schlieper used that to take fast time honors with a lap of 15.024. The
      sheet metal, or lack thereof, allowed the right rear of the car to roll
      more through the tricky corners at Kankakee, thus getting more bite as
      well. Schlieper did not prove as fortunate in the feature however, as he
      slid from second to fourteenth in the final rundown.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Jim Farris of Odell, IL picked up his
      first win of the season in UMP open-wheel modified action, after passing
      Dave Porth (Gardner, IL) with about six laps to go. Following that duo to
      the stripe were Matt Rhyne of Crown Point, IN, Lance Dehm of Chatsworth,
      IL, and Kevin Hastings of Fairbury, IL. Phil Line, Aaron Ricketts, Matt
      Bachman, Mick Roach, and Missouri's Jim Shereck rounded out the top ten.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Heat races were won by Porth, Tommy Kroll,
      and Rhyne, while Shereck captured the consolation race.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In street stock competition, Kevin Lenzen
      of Wilmington, IL became the track's only repeat winner thus far this year
      at the 1/3-mile speed-plant. Trailing Lenzen to the checkered flag were
      Mike Cavanaugh, John Geary, Jay Hamilton, and Jay Morris. Jeff Momper,
      Darren Kohler, Rick LaFine, Joe Hamilton, and Chris Schoon rounded out the
      top ten.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Heat race action saw Billy Wicker, Lenzen,
      and Momper record the wins, while John Hennessey won the consolation race.</font></p>

    Toczek, Rhyne, Walter, &amp; Howard All Repeat Winners at Crown Point
    Speedway<br>
    <br>
    by Paul D. Bayne<br>
    <br>
    CROWN POINT, IN (June 22) - Shawn Toczek of Hebron earned his second win of
    the season in UMP late model action Saturday night at the Crown Point
    Speedway. Toczek started on the pole of the 20-lap feature and led wire to
    wire on a track that permitted little passing all night long. With the
    victory, Toczek maintains his slim points lead. Finishing second was Frank
    Reaber of Bensonville, IL, followed by 2001 track champion Al Atkinson of
    Kenosha, WI, Ted Loomis of Kingston, IL, and Scott Martin of Valparaiso.<br>
    <br>
    Preliminary heat races were won by Loomis, Bill Luse, and Toczek, while Mike
    Metz claimed the consolation race.<br>
    <br>
    In open-wheel UMP modified action, Crown Point's Matt Rhyne returned to his
    winning ways by picking up his third checkered flag in the last four weeks.
    Rhyne, who began on the pole of the 20-lapper, said &quot;I knew I could
    stay out front if I just didn't make a mistake.&quot; Dan Hamstra of Fair
    Oaks, IN, closed the gap on Rhyne over the final few laps, but each time
    Rhyne powered away on the straight-aways. Hamstra settled for second while
    third place went to Joe Clark of Gary. 2001 track champion William Harrison
    of Black Oak and Kevin Hastings of Kankakee, IL finished fourth, and fifth,
    respectively.<br>
    <br>
    Jason Potts of Morocco, Bill Davis of Chesterton, and Rhyne all scored heat
    race wins, while Bridgeview, Illinois' Mike McCarthy won the consolation
    race.<br>
    <br>
    Tim Walter of Valparaiso, continued his reign of terror over local street
    stock competition, as he motored by early race leader and Thursday night
    winner Hank Rhyne, on lap 12 and never looked back in the 15-lap affair. The
    win was the fifth of the year for the former super stock champion. Giving
    chase at the stripe was 2001 track champion Bob McLean of Hobart, Rhyne of
    Black Oak, Nigel Mayes Jr. of Gary, and Scott Cunningham of Chesterton.<br>
    <br>
    In preliminary heat race action, Mayes Jr., Rhyne, and Rick Sills of Portage
    all captured checkered flags, while Tim Skinner won the consolation race.
    Rhyne also won the six-lap trophy dash.<br>
    <br>
    The largest field of mini stocks this year, 16, did battle on the 1/3-mile
    clay oval, and when the dust had finally settled for the evening it was Greg
    Howard scoring a clean sweep of all the action he was involved with. Howard
    won the six-lap trophy dash to earn the right to start on the pole, and from
    there he led all 15 laps en route to his third win of the season. Ron Ogborn
    cam home in second, while Peter Hayes, Jeff Wilson, and Ray Veenstra rounded
    out the top five.<br>
    <br>
    Howard and newcomer Butch Martin each garnered heat race wins.<br>

                  Miller Time Again in Michigan<br>
                  <br>
                  by Paul D. Bayne<br>
                  <br>
                  HARTFORD, MI (June 21) - Matt Miller of Waterville, OH may
                  want to consider taking up residency in the state of Michigan.
                  Particularly after winning for the third time this season in
                  Sunoco American Late Model Series action. Miller had won
                  previously at Ionia Raceway Park and Crystal Speedway back in
                  early May. All three wins have come in the state of Michigan.
                  &quot;The tracks here and Ionia (formerly I-96 Speedway), the
                  big 1/2-miles for some reason seem to fit my style are far as
                  being smooth and aggressive,&quot; said Miller. &quot;I don't
                  know, we got something that really works in this car right
                  here. We changed the setup quite a bit before the start of the
                  feature, just guessing a little bit, and couldn't ask for much
                  better to be honest with you,&quot; he added.<br>
                  <br>
                  As polesitter Greg Johnson brought the field to the line for
                  the start, it was apparent that something was wrong with the
                  left front suspension, as the car dragged the nosepiece on the
                  ground. The body work resemble more of a NHRA funny car than
                  it did a late model at that point. When the green flag was
                  waved over the field Johnson and Bill Hahn led the field into
                  turns one and two. Three cars tangled in turn two, including
                  Todd Nuding, Greg Cooper, and Matt Mead, bringing out a quick
                  caution. Several other cars received some body damage, the
                  worst of which was Steve Casebolt Jr., as the whole right side
                  of his car was a twisted, wrinkled mess. It was soon learned
                  that no cautions would be quick ones on this night.
                  Nonetheless, after a complete restart, Johnson showed no ill
                  effects, as he held the lead for the first five laps.<br>
                  <br>
                  After several other cautions due mostly to driver ineptness,
                  and a countless supply of caution laps, racing did in fact
                  continue. Jeff Kohn inherited the lead when Johnson finally
                  broke down and took his car behind the wall for repairs. When
                  the race finally resumed Matt Miller wasted little time moving
                  to the front on lap seven and proceeded to leave Kohn and
                  others in his wake as he sailed out to a straight-away lead
                  over the rest of the field. Johnson did return to competition
                  in hopes of earning valuable championship points, but was
                  scored one lap down.<br>
                  <br>
                  With the race now finally finding some sense of a rhythm,
                  Miller continued to show his dominance over the field. Kohn,
                  driving a car formerly driven by Kris Patterson, fought off
                  the challenges of his former mentor for the second spot
                  throughout the remainder of the race. Jeep Van Wormer, winner
                  of the previous ALMS visit to Hartford, looked to be the car
                  on the move as he slid up to fourth after starting eighth.
                  However, Van Wormer could rise no more as track conditions
                  became increasingly difficult to pass the faster cars. Van
                  Wormer had his hands full of Illini driver Ted Loomis late in
                  the race, as the two went side-by-side for fourth late in the
                  race. Loomis would discover misfortune however, as Hillard
                  Miller got into Loomis, when Loomis had slowed for the lapped
                  car of Dean Anderson. The contact was enough that Loomis was
                  forced to pit with five laps to go with a flat left rear tire.<br>
                  <br>
                  As the field closed in on the checkered flag, it was Miller
                  earning his third win of the season followed by Kohn, who had
                  a strong run of his own, and Patterson. Rounding out the top
                  ten were Van Wormer, Hillard Miller, Rick DeLong, Brian
                  Ruhlman, Randy Woodling, Hahn, and Logan Beckwith.<br>
                  <br>
                  In preliminary heat race action, the field was divided into
                  three seven-car heats, each eight-laps the distance. In the
                  first heat, it was the veteran driver Woodling holding off
                  Beckwith, Kohn, and Hillard Miller. However, Beckwith was
                  found to be light at the scales following the race and was
                  subsequently disqualified. Therefore, DeLong was moved up to
                  the fourth spot and transferred to the main event, while
                  Beckwith would start tail of the consolation race.<br>
                  <br>
                  Heat two belonged to Patterson, who ran away from Casebolt
                  Jr., Van Wormer, and Loomis, in what may have been the most
                  competitive of the three heat races.<br>
                  <br>
                  Heat three provided all the fireworks as far as preliminary
                  action. Matt Miller went into turn four under heavy throttle
                  and tagged the side of Hahn's machine sending Hahn into a
                  360-degree spin that collected the cars of Brian McCabe,
                  Nuding, and Ruhlman. Ruhlman was forced pitside with right
                  side damage, while Miller was sent to the rear for rough
                  driving. When they crossed the stripe it was Johnson earning
                  the win over Hahn, Matt Miller, and Matt Mead.<br>
                  <br>
                  Ruhlman scored an easy win over Tim Sabo, Nuding, Anderson,
                  McCabe in the consolation event.<br>

                  News &amp; Notes:<br>
                  Only twenty-one cars filed into the Hartford pits tonight
                  including Greg Johnson's crew chief, Mario Rinaldi, toying
                  around in the backup car. Hey... easy way to pocket an extra
                  $200 for start money. Good thinking Greg! Johnson did have a
                  rough night however, before the race even started. A shock pin
                  fell out of the left front shock, and Johnson was forced to
                  pit on lap five under caution. When he finally returned, he
                  had gone a lap down. Otherwise, he ran strong with the leaders
                  all night. Crew member Dean Miracle was injured and taken to a
                  local area hospital for treatment of burns he received when he
                  was burned by scalding hot fluids from a broken radiator hose.
                  Apparently, Johnson damaged the radiator on his car as the
                  left front nose dragged along the ground, particularly under
                  caution speeds.<br>
                  <br>
                  Matt Miller of Waterville, OH picked up the point on lap 7 and
                  simply checked out, several times even! The race was filled
                  with cautions and the laps they ran under caution was
                  ridiculous. They must have turned in 50-laps by the completion
                  of lap 13. The Rocket Chassis Grand Prix is the weapon of
                  choice for Miller and DSI Motorsports. The team is backed by
                  Lo-Temp Brazing, Stephen McCullough Motorsports, Russell Baker
                  Racing Engines, Banshee Graphics, McDonald Refrigeration, and
                  Whaley &amp; Son Collision.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I was happy to see some of that lap traffic, because I
                  could pretty much go wherever I wanted on the racetrack, and I
                  like putting lap cars between me and who ever's behind me, and
                  if a caution does come out it gives me just a bit of an edge
                  just enough to get out front and settle back in again. I'm
                  kind of like a rhythm driver. The longer I can go, the better
                  I get. Sometimes late in the race you get out of your rhythm
                  is you ease up a little bit,&quot; Miller said in a post-race
                  interview.<br>
                  <br>
                  Miller, who competes on many traveling circuits, offered his
                  thoughts on the Sunoco ALMS series. &quot;I've never run the
                  whole series. It's a good series with good drivers and it's
                  pretty close to home. We're kind of staying close to home
                  right now, we've struggled with a lot of bad luck, and a lot
                  of driver errors, so for the next couple of weeks we're kind
                  of going to stay close to home. We'll be back here for the big
                  race (July 12th UMP Summernationals $10,000-to-win) and a
                  little bit of traveling here close to home.<br>
                  <br>
                  As for Hartford Speedway Park, located just north of I-94 at
                  exit 46 in the small hub of Hartford, Miller's thought's are
                  unlike any race fans. The track under new management has seen
                  a resurgence in the interest of big time dirt late model
                  racing. &quot;It's an excellent track, I mean both times I've
                  been here it's been racy and you can come from the back and
                  run all over the place. I don't know, they get a heck of a
                  crowd, and they support these (late models) and they seem to
                  enjoy them. It's good racing. In three weeks they're going to
                  get a heck of a show, I can tell you that right now&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Ted Loomis of Kingston, IL, driving the Bockman's Amoco, Hayes
                  Body Shop GRT/Rhyne Competition Engines Monte Carlo, started
                  11th and rose to 5th with 5 laps to go. However, Hillard
                  Miller got into Loomis and broke the valve stem off the left
                  rear tire, ending Teddy's great run. Loomis was challenging
                  Jeep Van Wormer for 4th when the incident occurred. With
                  Loomis' name no longer a secret among knowledgeable dirt late
                  model race fans, one thing seems for sure with his high-flyer.
                  Sooner or later he'll find his way to a ALMS victory lane.<br>
                  <br>
                  Four-time ALMS champ Kris Patterson of St. John's, MI assumed
                  the point lead over Johnson after running a solid third while
                  Johnson faltered. Patterson was pleased his results but even
                  more pleased with the racing and the track itself. &quot;It's
                  a long season to come, the best man will win it at the end. I
                  guess you count them points of how you race all year, I've
                  done it long enough. We had kind of a bad year, we started out
                  slow and it's come around finally,&quot; said Patterson.
                  &quot;The track was really good out there tonight. It got kind
                  of slippery there at the end, but they had the track in good
                  shape,&quot; he added.<br>

    14) - With the threat of rain out of sight, Farmer City Raceway readied
    itself for a fast and exciting night of dirt late model racing action.&nbsp;
    RC Cola presented a double dose of late model action with the RC Cola Twin
    30's.<br>
    <br>
    In the first 30-lap affair, Roger Long of Fithian, IL, picked up the point
    on lap 11 when fast qualifer and early leader Junior Shickel slipped off
    turn two.&nbsp; With late race help from a spinning lap car that tangled
    with Shickel in the closing laps, Long went on to claim the first of two
    $1,500 winner's checks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Joe Harlan, who was running a very strong third, received the black flag on
    lap 15 after suffering a broken left front tie rod.&nbsp; However, Harlan
    was able to stay up to speed, giving up the third spot to only Joe Ross Jr.&nbsp;
    Harlan took his machine pitside, but obviously was displeased with the
    officials decision to send him off.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Caution flew on the speedway on lap 17 when Cody Hupp and Billy Tuckwell
    greeted each other in turn three.&nbsp; Four laps later, the yellow flag was
    unfurled again for Hupp, Wes Steidinger, and Jammie Wilson, who stacked them
    up in turn three again.&nbsp; Hupp and Wilson would soon learn that their
    cars were damaged enough to send them to the trailers.<br>
    <br>
    On the ensuing restart, Dennis Erb Jr. who rode in the eighth position,
    never came up to speed and headed off the backstretch into the pits.&nbsp;
    His night was done.<br>
    <br>
    As the laps clicked off, Long tried to shake Shickel from his rear bumper,
    but it wasn't until Steidinger had spun in front of the leaders, that Long
    was able to get any distance from Shickel.&nbsp; The mishap collected only
    the car of Shickel, but Shickel was able to continue on after falling to
    fourth.&nbsp; &quot;I came up on Steidinger there, and he turned in front of
    me.&nbsp; We never made any kind of contact there.&nbsp; We got a little
    lucky I guess,&quot; said Long in victory circle.<br>
    <br>
    Benefitting from the late race mishap was Steve Sheppard Jr. and Ross Jr.,
    who finished second and third, respectively.&nbsp; Shickel and John
    Provenzano rounded out the top five.&nbsp; Matt Taylor, Kerby Damery, Tom
    Pauley, Eric Smith, and Brian Shirley all secured top tens.<br>
    <br>
    After the completion of the first RC Cola 30-lapper, the fastest 14
    qualifiers were inverted for the start of the nightcap.&nbsp; This would
    mean that Sheppard Jr. and Taylor would get front row starting spots, and
    that's where they would remain throughout the entire contest.&nbsp; Taylor
    would apply the heat throughout much of the early going, and momentarily
    appear to have the lead near the midway mark, but that was negated by
    Sheppard Jr. who used the momentum through turns three and four to hold off
    Taylor.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Sheppard Jr. distanced himself from Taylor over the final ten laps, opening
    up a straight-away lead.&nbsp; When the checkered flag waved it was Sheppard
    Jr. earning the win over Taylor, Damery, Long, and Billy Tuckwell, who
    bumped his way up to a top five after starting 19th.&nbsp; Rounding out the
    top ten were Harlan, Fegers, Shirley, Lonnie Franklin, and Hupp.<br>
    <br>
    Junior Shickel set the pace for 37-cars in qualifying by turning a lap of
    12.971 seconds.&nbsp; Two-time track champion Joe Ross Jr. returned to
    Farmer City and picked up the Racer's Performance Memoribilia trophy dash.&nbsp;
    Heat race checkers were earned by Wisconsin's Al Atkinson, Donnie Walden,
    and Sheppard Jr.&nbsp; For Walden, it was his first-ever win in the late
    model division.&nbsp; The youngster, who just recently graduated from high
    school, appeared to have his early season handling problems well behind him.&nbsp;
    Pauley and Hupp scored consolation race victories.<br>
    <br>
    In UMP open-wheel modified action, Matt Bachman of Gibson City (IL) led from
    start to finish to pick up his first feature win of the season.&nbsp;
    Trailing Bachman to the line were Kyle Byerline, Tim O'Donnell, John Hudson,
    and Lance Dehm.<br>

      <p>CROWN POINT, Ind. (June 1) - Bensonville's (IL) Frank Reaber returned
      to Crown Point Speedway to tend to some unfinished business he started
      several weeks back. While leading the late model feature back on May 3rd,
      and seemingly going for a &quot;walk in the park&quot;, Reaber found
      misfortune when he became involved with two lap cars that had tangled in
      front of him. The end result would knock Reaber from the race and allow
      Dick Potts to record the win. Saturday however, Reaber picked up right
      where he left off and led flag to flag to earn the $800 first place prize
      money.</p>
      <p>A beautiful warm June evening greeted 88 race teams and a throng of
      hungry race fans. The main grandstands were near capacity for what would
      turn out to be one &quot;wild&quot; night of racing action. It all began
      in street stock heat race number three, when Mike Fultz collected the
      front stretch wall and rolled violently several times before coming to
      rest on all fours. Fultz, as some may have noticed, likes to drive with
      one hand on the wheel with the other grasping the cross member of the roll
      cage. Fultz may want to rethink that driving style before climbing back
      into his race car. Fultz was shaken slightly, but did walk away from the
      incident with nothing more than some pain in his right arm.</p>
      <p>Next up was an incident in the street stock trophy dash.&nbsp; Charlie
      Dockter and Glen Coppage got together in turn four, with Dockter
      collecting the outer retaining blocks hard. Two of the blocks were
      dislodged, with one of them being sent down into the pit area. After a
      lengthy delay to repair the situation, racing resumed. Neither driver was
      injured in the mishap.</p>
      <p>However, the scariest incident, and one that could have turned out
      much, much worse than it did, occurred during the late model consolation
      race. J.R. Cowger, a late arrival to the speedway, was running in seventh
      position and a lap down when he collected the turn three wall, and without
      warning, launched up and over the wall and into the pit area. The incident
      could have been frighteningly different if it had not been for the head's
      up from track officials keeping the area free and clear throughout the
      race evening. Cowger was transported to St. Anthony's Hospital in Crown
      Point, but seemed to know who he was and where he was. He was placed in a
      neck brace as a precaution, but no other injuries were reported. We can
      all thank the lucky stars that were out last night, that no one else was
      in harm's way on the other side of that wall. A reminder to us all that
      these cars often times do crazy and unpredictable things without warning.</p>
      <p>Currently, there is no safety catch fencing guarding turns three and
      four, but you can bet there will be shortly. The fence had become old and
      decayed, and quite frankly, was an eye sore. Therefore it was removed with
      the intentions on replacing it as soon as possible. Insurance
      representatives and fencing contractors have already visited the speedway
      within the last week and efforts are being made by new management to
      rectify the situation. Safety for the drivers and fans is of utmost
      importance to the new management team.</p>
      <p>Recapping the late model feature action, Reaber, the 2001 Northern
      All-stars Late Model Series (NALMS) Rookie of the Year, driving the
      M&amp;R Wrecking GRT / Rhyne Competition Engines Grand Prix, took the lead
      from his pole position and turned out the lights on the competition.
      Reaber was chased by long-time friend and last week's winner Ted Loomis of
      Kingston, IL. Following that duo were &quot;The Milwaukee Madman&quot; Al
      Atkinson, Eddie Leviner, and Guy Volk.</p>
      <p>On lap two, veteran driver Bill Luse got loose in turn two bringing out
      the only caution of the race. When racing resumed it was evident that
      visibility would become a factor as the race wore on. Track conditions
      were smooth, yet dusty as the daylong sun and breezy winds made it
      difficult for track crews to keep moisture in the racing surface. &quot;It
      wasn't that bad out there, but of course being out front had something to
      do with that obviously,&quot; said Reaber.</p>
      <p>Atkinson challenged Loomis for the runner-up spot for several laps
      until finally making the pass on lap seven coming off turn two. The two
      talented pilots went door-to-door delighting the large crowd in
      attendance. When Atkinson was free and clear of Loomis, he honed in on
      Reaber, but lap traffic proved to be Reaber's friend this time out rather
      than his foe. When Reaber would clear the back-markers, Atkinson would
      battle with them, and so on and so forth until the checkered flag fell.</p>
      <p>As the field took the checkered flag from starter Steve Parkes, it was
      Reaber scoring the win and becoming the fourth different winner in as many
      weeks. Atkinson, the 2001 late model track champion, finished second,
      while Loomis, Leviner, and Volk all claimed top five finishes. Rounding
      out the top ten were Shawn Toczek, Mark Stetler, Dave Lilja, Jason Widdes,
      and Jim Loomis. The hard-charger of the race was Jason Widdes, who started
      16th and finished ninth.</p>
      <p>Heat race victories went to Stetler, Bill Workman, and Reaber, while
      Todd McGarr topped the consolation race. Eddie Leviner posted fast time on
      the evening with a lap of 13.120 in pre-race qualifying, an average speed
      of just under 92 m.p.h.</p>
      <p>Matt Rhyne of Crown Point (IN), continued his winning ways of recent
      days in UMP open-wheel modified action, as he motored around early leader
      and polesitter Kevin Hastings of Fairbury, IL, on the high side of lap
      five and went on to an uncontested triumph. Rhyne, driving the Sunshine
      Mart Pierce / Rhyne Competition Engines entry, has earned three wins in
      his last three outings. Last Sunday, Rhyne earned the $1,000-to-win B Main
      at Vermilion County Speedway in Danville, IL, during the ninth annual
      David Richardson Memorial race weekend. The event typically draws top
      drivers from around the country, and this year was no exception as 109 UMP
      open-wheel modified drivers took part. Friday night at Kankakee Motor
      Speedway, Rhyne bested a stellar field of cars to earn a second win, which
      gave the team some great momentum heading into Crown Point. Rhyne, an
      established engine builder by trade (Rhyne Competition Engines in Crown
      Point), seems to be hitting on all cylinders these days in his 370c.i.
      powerplant. Rhyne has partnered himself up with longtime modified star
      Mick Roach, owner of the Sunshine Mart in Bradley, IL.</p>
      <p>Hastings efforts in keeping pace with Rhyne were futile, but he did
      record his best finish of the season in grabbing the second spot.
      Following that twosome to the stripe were Chesterton's (IN) Dick Wood,
      Kankakee's (IL) Phil Line, and Roger Duszynski of Black Oak (IN). Rounding
      out the top ten were Joe Clark, Steve Fuller, Bill Davis, and Steve
      Hughes. Duszynski was the hard-charger of the race coming from the 13th
      starting spot to finish fifth.</p>
      <p>The race became extremely dusty and even track officials scoring the
      race had their hands full in keeping the field of 18 in order, but no task
      seems daunting to this crew. Oddly enough, there were no cautions
      throughout the modified feature, which might be reason enough to contact
      the Guiness Book of World Records. The race took approximately six minutes
      to complete. Only Bill Wise and Brian Beier fell from competition.</p>
      <p>Preliminary heat races were won by Clark, Wise, and Hastings, while
      Bill Stineback returned to action after a one year absence and scored the
      consolation race win. Dick Wood set fast time in pre-race qualifying with
      a lap of 14.610 seconds, an average of 82 m.p.h.</p>
      <p>There were no street stock or mini stock features run due to time
      constraints. Those events will be made up next week.</p>
      <p>Speaking of next week, Crown Point Speedway hosts the American Mini
      Sprint Association (AMSA). These little pocket rockets run 1200cc Kawasaki
      race engines and they have circled the 1/3-mile oval in just over 11
      seconds. There will be no late models racing this coming weekend, as the
      late models take a week off for the running of The Dream at Eldora
      Speedway in Rossburg, OH. Typically, drivers from all across the country
      come to try to cash in on the $100,000-to-win top prize. Over 240 late
      models are expected from as far away as Australia. Qualifying begins
      Friday evening, with heat races and main events taking place on Saturday
      night. For more information about this race or travel directions, go to

    <p>KANKAKEE, Ill. (May 31) - With four weeks of weekly racing now in the
    books at Kankakee Motor Speedway, there still has yet to be a repeat winner
    in any of the three divisions of racing. This week, Dennis Erb Jr., Matt
    Rhyne, and Jay Hamilton all achieved top honors in their respective
    divisions.</p>
    <p>Wes Steidinger, the young rookie late model ace out of Fairbury, IL, set
    the tone on the evening earning his first career fast qualifier award as he
    circled the slick 1/3-mile in 15.466. After qualifying was completed, track
    management surveyed the high-banked bullring and decided to topcoat with
    water on the high side of the track's surface. This turned the track into a
    tacky euphoria for some, and a grippy nightmare for others. Three abreast
    racing proved to be the norm tonight, rather than the exception. Nevetheless,
    race fans were treated to perhaps the best racing of the season, on easily
    the nicest race night of the year so far, with temperatures in the upper
    80's throughout the day, yet comfortable throughout the evening.</p>
    <p>Dennis Erb Jr., of Carpentersville, IL, driving the BK Sportswear
    Rayburn/Bullock Race Engines Monte Carlo, started on the pole position by
    virtue of his trophy dash triumph, and sped out to an early lead over last
    week's winner Joe Harlan, and John Provenzano. The race had to be completely
    restarted however, as Jay Fiene, Cody Hupp, and Mike Busch all cam together
    beneath the flagman's stand on the frontstretch. Only Hupp was unable to
    continue, as his string of bad luck continued at KMS.</p>
    <p>On the ensuing restart, Erb Jr. again jumped out to the point in front of
    Provenzano, and Harlan this time. Gibson City's Kevin Weaver wasted little
    time advancing his position, as he motored from seventh to fourth by the
    completion of lap one. Two laps later, the caution flag was unfurled again
    when Fiene, Shawn Toczek, and Eric Kwasigroh all came together in turn two.</p>
    <p>On lap five, Al Atkinson got a little out of shape entering turn three,
    but was straightened out by an oncoming Wes Steidinger, who was not as
    fortunate, and forced to the rear of the field. Fiene, the current points
    leader coming into the event, had decided his car had suffered too much
    damage from the incident on the opening lap, and retired to the pit area.
    When the green flag was thrown again, Erb Jr., Provenzano, Harlan, Weaver,
    and Pohlman Jr. ran in the top five, while Tom Pauley and Richie Hedrick
    engaged in a battle for the sixth spot. Weaver moved under Harlan for third,
    then Provenzano for second, as Harlan also pushed Provenzano back to fourth
    on lap six.</p>
    <p>Erb Jr., the &quot;One Man Gang&quot;as he's known around the racing
    circles, had begun to stretch out a lead over Weaver, who had moved past
    Provenzano on lap nine. In the mean time, Steidinger had pulled his machine
    to the infield grass with handling problems. Lap thirteen saw Pauley and
    Hedrick go literally door-to-door fighting for the sixth position. The dup
    knocked doors coming off of turn four, and again in turn one, until finally
    something had to give. Hedrick and Pauley both spun in turn two, but HEdrick
    was able to continue on when Pauley righted his ship.</p>
    <p>After a lap 16 caution involving Mike Busch and Tom Peltonen, the field
    ran caution-free for the remainder of the race. Weaver kept Erb Jr. within
    reach, but never posed a threat for the lead over the final fourteen laps.
    At the stripe it was Erb Jr. earning the win, with Weaver second, Pohlman
    Jr. third, Reaber, and Harlan, fourth and fifth, respectively. Rounding out
    the field were Pauley, Mark Stetler, and Bill Reiniche.</p>
    <p>All totaled, only eight cars were able to go the distance, as attrition
    set in and claimed over half the starting field of 18. The race was slowed
    by five yellow flags.</p>
    <p>Heat race winners included Frank Heckenast, Fiene, and Weaver, while Erb
    Jr. captured the trophy dash, and Atkinson claimed the consolation race.</p>
    <p>In UMP open-wheel modified action, Crown Point's (IN) Matt Rhyne reached
    the checkers ahead of the field for the first time this year at KMS.
    Teammate Mick Roach, driving an identical Sunshine Mart Bob Pierce/Rhyne
    Competition Engines machine finished fourth behind runner-up Matt Bachman,
    and Tim Reynolds.</p>
    <p>The race began with Tommy Kroll vaulting into the early lead, but trouble
    on the frontstretch left Kyle Logue facing the wall just short of the
    start-finish line. It appeared that the night was over as Logue took his car
    back to the pit area. However, the race was delayed for a non-racing related
    incident in the grandstands that red-flagged the field for nearly ten
    minutes, while another ambulance was beckoned from a nearby hospital. This
    gave Logue and his crew time to make repairs and get him back out for the
    race's restart.</p>
    <p>When racing resumed, Kroll again dashed to the early lead over Bachman
    and Rhyne. Dale Leuth and Dave Porth went side-by-side for the fourth spot,
    while points leader Lance Dehm rode &quot;roofless&quot; in sixth. For Dehm,
    it was nothing short of a miracle that he even made the show, as he rolled
    his car mildly in the trophy dash and sustained quite a bit of damage. Kudos
    go out to the Dehm crew for keeping Lance alive in the points hunt.</p>
    <p>Logue's string of Kankakee bad luck would continue as he and Kevin
    Hastings came together hard on the frontstretch on lap three. On the
    restart, Kroll of Chebanse, IL, seemingly had things well in hand, when
    trouble found him on lap nine, as he slowed and moved to the rim of the
    race-track. Kroll was able to manuever his car safely off the track without
    incident, and this handed the lead over to Bachman who was being hounded by
    Rhyne, Leuth, Bob Pohlman Jr., and Dehm.</p>
    <p>Pohlman Jr. pulled up lame when he looped his car in turn two with seven
    laps to go. The cause was a flat left rear tire, and Pohlman's charge had
    come to an end. Dehm and Leuth slowed the field once again when they got
    together along the front straight-away. One lap later, the final caution
    appeared when Leuth spun in turn one with just three to go. For Leuth, the
    2000 track champion, it was a frustrating night as he was involved in four
    of the race's seven cautions.</p>
    <p>Rhyne, who worked his way by Bachman for the lead on lap 15, went on to
    pick up his first win of the season, followed by Bachman, Reynolds, Roach,
    who started 15th &amp; 16th respectively, and Josh Ferguson. Filling out the
    top ten were rookie Dave Rudisill, 2001 track champion R.J. Gall, Leuth, Jim
    Farris, and Dehm. Only ten of the 18 starters were able to finish the race,
    that was slowed by seven cautions and one red flag situation.</p>
    <p>Heats were won by Phil Line, Roach, and Farris, while Kroll took the
    trophy dash and Reynolds topped the consolation race. Dehm set fast time in
    qualfying with a 16.257 effort.</p>
    <p>The streets stocks took the green flag at 11:25pm, and hopes were that
    they would run flag to flag without incident. That appeared to be the case
    until lap nine of the scheduled 15-lapper, when chaos tookover. Jay Hamilton
    grabbed the early lead over polesitter Jake Howard, Steve McCarty, Chad
    Osterhoff, and Billy Wicker. Wicker grabbed the third spot momentarily from
    McCarty on lap two, but McCarty was there to answer the bell. One lap later,
    McCarty slipped off the high side in turn two relinquishing third and fourth
    to Wicker and Osterhoff.</p>
    <p>While Wicker applied the heat to Hamilton's rear bumper, Howard, John
    Geary, and McCarty rounded out the top five. Trouble found the field for the
    first time when Chris Schoon came to a halt in turn four on lap nine. One
    lap later, Howard and Osterhoff got together sliding down the frontstretch.
    The incident left both drivers exchanging hand signals while circling the
    track and rejoining the rear of the field. Meanwhile, Kevin Lenzen of
    Wilmington, IL had moved from his 14th starting spot up to eighth by this
    point.</p>
    <p>As the cars took the white flag, it looked as though Wicker had a run off
    the top of turn four and would move into the lead, but Hamilton held him
    off. The two went door-to-door for the win, while Lenzen had scurried up to
    third by now. He was followed by Matt Cleary and Steve McCarty, who was
    driving the #4C of Rick LaFine. Rounding out the top ten were Howard, Jay
    Morris, Shannon Shutter, Darrin Kohler, and John Geary.</p>
    <p>When the field crossed the stripe, mayhem erupted with several cars
    colliding on the frontstretch including Morris and Geary. Geary car took a
    violent trip onto the edge of the infield, but did not get upside down.
    Nevertheless, Geary was not happy with Morris for whatever reason, and it
    appeared he was going to have his work cut out for him to get the car ready
    for Saturday.</p>
    <p>Preliminary heat races were claimed by Howard, Hamilton, and Steve
    McCarty, while Mike Cavanaugh won the trophy dash, and Lenzen won the
    consolation race.</p>
    <p>Kankakee Motor Speedway takes a one week hiatus next Friday night, as
    &quot;The Dream&quot; is slated to be run at Eldora Speedway in Rossburg,
    OH. Over 200 late models are expected to compete, with the winner's share
    being a cool $100,000.</p>
    <p>Racing resumes at KMS on June 14th with a full program of racing action,
    including one lucky fan's chance to race in competition throughout the night
    in the special two-seat late model with long-time Illinois standout Jim O'
    Connor. Watch for full details of this lucky person's &quot;wild
    night&quot;, from start to finish, as I will chronicle the entire experience

      <p>DANVILLE, IL (May 26) - This Memorial Day holiday weekend, is a time to
      reflect on all the men and women who have so graciously gave their lives
      to fight and protect our freedoms through wars on the battlefield's.
      Sunday night, a battle of a different sort took place at Vermilion County
      Speedway in Danville, IL. A night in which tribute is paid to the life of
      David Richardson in what very well may be the most prestigious UMP
      modified race in the Midwest.</p>
      <p>The race itself could have been described by many superlatives, but one
      word that immediately comes to mind is &quot;incredible&quot;. Another
      word that comes to attention is &quot;attrition&quot;. Nonetheless, when
      all was said and done, it was Randle Sweeney of Clifty, KY, driving a 2001
      Beckum chassis, powered by a Branon's Performance Engine, that would prove
      to be the beneficiary of a late race incident that claimed the top three
      cars. From that point on, Sweeney circled the track on the point and went
      on to pick up perhaps the biggest win of his career in the David
      Richardson Memorial race at Vermilion County Speedway in Danville, IL.</p>
      <p>Only ten of the 26 cars that started were able to keep it together and
      run the entire 50-lap distance. Five cars were involved in a lap 36 crash
      when leader Arby Burton, second place Tommy Burnside, and third place Kyle
      Logue all got together in turn four and collected the cars of Dan Hamstra
      and Denny Schwartz as well. With the cars running most of the race in
      single file on the rim of the race track, Burnside tried to get a look
      inside Burton going into turn four. Logue then dove to the inside of both
      Burton and Burnside, and when he couldn't hold that line, slid up into
      Burnside, who in turn collected Burton's machine. All three cars were
      damaged enough to be taken pitside. Logue also received the black flag for
      his move.</p>
      <p>Burton, who had taken over the lead on lap 17 when leader Billy Vaughn
      spun in turn four, appeared to be on his way to the biggest payday of his
      career before the incident took place. Vaughn assumed the point on the
      opening circuit after powering by polesitter and fast qualifier Elvin
      Herschberger of Peru, IN, on the outside. Vaughn attacked the rim of the
      speedway in opening up a 12-car length lead over Burton and the boys.</p>
      <p>Five laps into the contest, the first yellow flag waved for the car of
      Gary Leonard, who had spun in turn two. By this point, 2001 UMP National
      champion Jimmy Owens had already begun to make his presence felt. After
      starting 25th on the grid, Owens had already worked his way into the top
      ten. As positions 2 - 8 fought tooth and nail for every inch on the
      speedway, Vaughn was continually building a sizable cushion over his
      counterparts. Burnside of Kansas, IL, the 2000 Richardson Memorial
      champion, had moved into fifth after starting eleventh. On the ensuing
      restart, former track champion Dan Hamstra of Fair Oaks, IN spun in turn
      one, and was placed on the tail of the field. Brent Londeree, however, was
      finding the going rough at the start, as he slid from third to eleventh by
      this time.</p>
      <p>Back under green, Vaughn wasted little time trying to rebuild the lead
      he saw vanish when the caution flag flew. On lap eight, Vaughn bobbled a
      bit off of turn two and allowed the field to close the gap. Burnside had
      moved past Weaver and began hounding Tony Roland's rear bumper. Ten laps
      into the contest it was Vaughn out front with Burton, Roland, Burnside,
      and Logue in tow. Weaver, Sweeney, Herschberger, Shane Cottle, and Owens
      rounded out the top ten.</p>
      <p>The next caution flag flew on lap 17 when Vaughn found misfortune in
      turn four and relinquished his lead to Burton. Roland was able to move
      back into second after a Burnside pass was negated due to the caution.
      With 20 laps now in the books, it was Burton being chased by Roland,
      Burnside, Logue, and Weaver, followed by Herschberger, Sweeney, Cottle,
      Owens, and Mike Marlar.</p>
      <p>By the half-way point, Tim O'Donnell had moved into the top ten while
      Cottle fell from it. As Burnside continued his assault on Roland for
      second, Weaver pressured Logue for the fourth spot. Owens meanwhile,
      pulled up lame on lap 28 with mechanical problems heading down the
      back-stretch and pulled his car into the pit area without incident. As
      Owens became a spectator, Burnside and Weaver both were able to out-muscle
      Roland back to the fourth spot, while Logue slipped to fifth.</p>
      <p>On lap 31, caution waved for the fourth time after contact between
      defending Richardson Memorial champion Denny Schwartz and Mark Moore made
      contact in turn one. Both were able to keep moving, but the caution flew
      to check the slowing car of Moore. Under the caution, Weaver pulled up to
      track officials for consultation, and was informed that he had a busted
      ball-joint. Weaver's night had come to an end in the Lightning Chassis
      house car.</p>
      <p>When the field took the ensuing green, it was Burton, Burnside, Logue,
      Roland, and Sweeney now, followed by Marlar, O'Donnell, Herschberger,
      Cottle, and Jeff Leka, who now was cracking the top ten for the first time
      of the night. About this time, Schwartz was starting to make a run up
      through the field and currently sat in 12th, after starting rear on the
      grid. Schwartz had been guaranteed a spot in the field by virtue of his
      win Friday night at nearby Charleston Speedway. The win Friday, netted
      Schwartz a sum of $3,000.</p>
      <p>Sweeney had wrestled the fourth spot away from Roland on lap 32, but
      Roland answered the call and reclaimed the position moments later. Roland
      however, would see his stout performance come to an end on lap 34, when
      apparently he fell victim to engine woes after slipping off the top-side
      in turns three &amp; four. Roland guided his TRI Motorsports/Buzzard
      chassis/Rhyne Competition Engines machine safely into the pit area without
      yielding a caution.</p>
      <p>On lap 37, several cars got together in turn one when Cottle got loose,
      thus collecting both Leka and Bob Pohlman Jr. For Cottle the night was
      done as he limped back to the pits with a broken left-front ball-joint.
      Josh Ferguson also took his car behind the wall with the same problem as
      Cottle.</p>
      <p>With ten to go, the lineup was Burton, Burnside, Logue, Sweeney, and
      Marlar, with O'Donnell, Schwartz, Herschberger, Michael Bradley, and
      Hamstra rounding out the top ten. Hamstra, had successfully worked his way
      back up through the field and into the top ten, after his lap six miscue.</p>
      <p>With time running out and patience wearing thin, the track was for the
      most part becoming unpassable. To pass, drivers had to use a good run off
      of the corners heading down the straight-aways, or get downright pushy
      with the car in front of them. On lap 36, the yellow flag flew once again
      when O'Donnell found trouble in turn three. With his car smoking,
      O'Donnell was forced to the infield by track officials which was much to
      his unliking. Pohlman Jr. retired to the pit area just prior to the
      yellow.</p>
      <p>This incident would set the stage for what would spark great
      controversy in the laps to come. With just fifteen cars now left on the
      track, Burton would lead them down again off of turn four for the restart.
      As Burton led the troops around to get the five-laps-to-go signal from
      starter Rick Isaacson, the top three cars could be covered seemingly by a
      postage stamp. In turn three Burnside edged his right front wheel
      alongside the left rear of Burton, while Logue saw an opportunity to
      gamble on the bottom of the racetrack in an attempt to slide by both of
      the front-runners. The gamble did not pay off, as all three cars collided
      causing chaos in turn four. While Logue was able to continue on and appear
      to be the new race leader, several other cars were collected by the
      ruckus, including Schwartz and Hamstra. Schwartz could only offer a wry
      smile, but did say that his car was &quot;trashed&quot; now. Hamstra
      thought he had cleared the carnage in turn four, but said, &quot;Burnside
      came rolling down the track, and I slowed to avoid him, but someone behind
      me ran over the right front of my car and broke the Pittman arm. I thought
      I had made it through there&quot;.</p>
      <p>Visibly upset, Burton rifled his helmet at the car of Logue when he
      came back around, while Burnside and others including Burton, discussed
      what had taken place. Burton had seen what seemingly was the biggest
      payday of his career go down the tubes. &quot;Guys just got greedy there
      at the end,&quot; said Hamstra. &quot;I was beginning to work that middle
      part of the track because it was just starting to come in,&quot; he added.</p>
      <p>While the wreckage was cleared, Logue was informed that not only did he
      break something on the rear of his car, but that he would be black-flagged
      for rough driving. Sweeney on the otherhand, found himself the new leader
      with just four laps to go, with Marlar, Herschberger, Bradley, and Bobby
      Bittle all set to give it their final shot. Without any further problems,
      Sweeney was able to fend off Marlar to claim the big prize. Bradley
      outdueled Herschberger to the line for the third spot.</p>
      <p>Rounding out the top ten at the stripe were Jason Lakey, Leonard, Lance
      Dehm, Vaughn, and Leka. It was most certainly a night where it paid to be
      at the back of the pack when the race got underway. Marlar of Winfield,
      TN, started 19th, Bradley of Paris, IL, started 24th. Leka, Marlar,
      Leonard, Dehm, Jason Lakey, and Bradley all came from out of the
      semi-features to reach the starting grid. All ended up with top ten
      finishes.</p>
      <p>While Sweeney celebrated in victory lane with his family, he said
      &quot;this is my fourth time here, and we've always been bitten by bad
      luck. Flat tires, broken rear-end...tonight it feels good to come out on
      the other end for a change. It was very satisfying to get a little
      redemption&quot;. When asked to describe the events that led to the
      collision in turn four that claimed the top three cars, Sweeney said
      &quot;it looked like good hard racing, I mean everyone was racing as clean
      as they could. I don't think it was anything intentional anywhere. It was
      just racing it looked like to me. Usually I come out the victim, this time
      I come out ahead&quot;. The winning entry was sponsored by ShadeTree
      Motorsports, Willhite Speed &amp; Performance, and R&amp;S Lumber Co.</p>
      <p>Only ten of the 26 cars that started the race were able to finish. The
      race saw three lead changes among four drivers, and was slowed by seven
      caution periods. In all 109 modifieds passed through the gates and took
      qualifying.</p>
      <p>As if the feature event didn't satisfy even the most die-hard race fan,
      well the heat races surely did. Some of the best action seen at Vermilion
      County this year occured in the heat races. Heat race winners included
      Herschberger over Sweeney, Burton over Scott Weber, Londeree over
      Burnside, Weaver over Cottle, Roland over O'Donnell, Logue over Bittle,
      and Hamstra over Pohlman Jr. Sweeney, Burnside, Roland, and Pohlman Jr.
      all came from deep in the pack to pick up transfer spots. Only Roland was
      able to power on to the heat race checkers.</p>

      Payday</strong></p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    </font><i><font size="2">
    <p>by Paul D. Bayne</p>
    </font></i><font size="2">
    <p>KANKAKEE, IL (May 14, 2002) - The United Dirt Track Racing Association
    embarked on a seven-race Spring Midwest Tour with the first stop being an
    inaugural visit to the high-banks of Kankakee Motor Speedway. After two
    steady days of heavy rainfall throughout much of the Central Illinois region
    drenched the Kankakee Fairgrounds, racing was able to commence on Tuesday
    night, as 47 cars filed into the pit area.</p>
    <p>Showing the way in his Larry Shaw Race Cars Rocket/Custom Grand Prix was
    1999 series champion Dale McDowell of Rossville, GA. McDowell started on the
    outside pole and led all 50 laps as he scampered to a relatively easy
    $10,000 payday. Giving chase at the finish was 28-year-old Illinois phenom
    Shannon Babb of Decatur, IL.</p>
    <p>The race came to a halt almost as fast as it started when &quot;The
    Kentucky Colonel&quot; Steve Francis blundered in turn three. Francis who
    started in the ninth position, made a move to the inside down the
    backstretch and upon entering turn three got the car a little out of shape,
    and subsequently checked up to correct the car. In so doing, Scott James of
    Lawrenceburg, IN collided with Francis and sent him on his way. This
    however, led to a chain reaction of cars piling into each other thus
    bringing out a red flag.</p>
    <p>Both James and four-time UDTRA champion Scott Bloomquist, who started
    19th, were done for the night without even completing a lap. Billy Drake,
    Earl Pearson Jr., and Steve Hillard were also involved and required repairs
    before returning to action. James was visibly disappointed with the turn of
    events as his new Warrior Race Car sustained a bent frame. Bloomquist's
    machine suffered heavy front-end damage. &quot;I had no place to go. I ran
    into Steve (Francis) when he checked up, then I got drilled from behind. The
    frame's bent,&quot; sighed James.</p>
    <p>After the tangle of cars were repaired and removed from the 1/3-mile
    speedplant, the field was set to try it all over again. Again it was Dale
    McDowell who dashed out to the early lead over polesitter and local hotshot
    Bob Pohlman Jr. of Oak Lawn, IL. On lap two, Babb muscled his way around
    Jimmy Mars of Elk Mound, WI for the third spot, and defending UDTRA champion
    Rick Eckert of York, PA had charged his way past Mars as well, from the
    sixth starting position.</p>
    <p>On lap four, three cars swapped sheet-metal right beneath starter Jim
    Whittington. 1997 UDTRA champion Billy Moyer of Batesville, AR, Bob Pierce
    of Oakwood, IL, and Darren &quot;The Thriller&quot; Miller of Chadwick, IL
    all banged doors resulting in Pierce sailing off the top-side of turn one.
    While Pierce remained off-course, the field stayed green until Moyer had
    slowed down the back straightaway and finally limped his car to a halt in
    turn one. Moyer's problem proved to be a broken left front tie-rod. Miller
    meanwhile, suffered a flat left rear tire, and when the caution came out, he
    too headed to the pits for some fresh rubber. Pierce now was able to rejoin
    the field at the back of the pack, and because the lineup reverts back to
    the last completed lap, Pierce apparently remained on the lead lap.</p>
    <p>This would set the stage for what proved to be the event's headliner.
    &quot;The Tall Cool One&quot; would delight the home folks with a charge to
    the front as only Bob Pierce can. From as far back as 20th position, Pierce
    quietly snuck his way up through traffic and towards the top ten.</p>
    <p>The third caution flag of the race was thrown for Lucas Oil Rookie of the
    Year candidate Shane Tankersley of Morganton, GA when he slipped over the
    edge of turn one on lap seven. Tankersley was none the worse for wear and
    was able to continue.</p>
    <p>With cars now attempting to work in the bottom groove, Francis began to
    make a move upwards for position, passing both Ray Cook and Don O'Neal for
    the sixth spot. By lap nine, Francis had worked his way by Mars and Eckert
    both, but Eckert would have none of it as he drove around Francis on the
    topside off of turn four. By lap 15, McDowell had checked out to nearly a
    straight-away advantage of Pohlman, Babb, Eckert, and Francis.</p>
    <p>By the half-way point McDowell still held the point, while Babb executed
    a text book &quot;slide-job&quot; pass of Pohlman in turn two. Eckert and
    Francis followed with Mars, O' Neal, Cook, Donnie Moran, and Dan Schlieper
    rounding out the top ten. One lap later, Eckert too, executed the
    &quot;slide-job&quot; on Pohlman to gain the third spot.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the best battle throughout the race involved the machines of
    Mars, O'Neal, Moran, and Cook, as they diced for position seemingly every
    other turn.</p>
    <p>With fifteen laps to go, Pohlman Jr. looped his mount in turn one in an
    effort to avoid contact with another car, thus bringing out the race's final
    caution flag. With McDowell's commanding lead now vanished, the field was
    set for a final sprint to the finish. Again it was McDowell who got the jump
    on the restart and quickly pulled out to a seven car length. Babb, Eckert,
    Francis, and O' Neal had absolutely nothing for McDowell over the last ten
    laps, but that didn't mean they were done racing for second. Mars, Cook,
    Moran, Pierce, and the ageless Freddy Smith completed the top ten as action
    resumed.</p>
    <p>With time running out, Pierce made his move, getting by Moran on the
    restart, then darting by Cook and Mars both, in one bold move underneath on
    lap 39. Pierce was now riding in the sixth spot, and on lap 43, slipped past
    Francis for fifth. On lap 48, Pierce drove by O'Neal on the inside to claim
    fourth, and on the final lap, Pierce dove off of turn four alongside Eckert
    to picked up the third spot in what was too close too call at the line.
    Following McDowell, Babb, and Pierce were Eckert, O' Neal, Francis, Mars,
    Cook, Smith, and Moran. Twelve cars finished on the lead lap, and four
    cautions slowed the field. The show concluded in just over 2 hours, with
    fans headed for their vehicles before 10pm.</p>
    <p>While the capacity crowd applauded McDowell's dominance, they were in a
    frenzy by the performance of their hero Pierce. &quot;The Tall Cool
    One&quot; had come up short this time, but made it well worth the price of
    admission for these hungry race fans. Upon completion of the race, Pierce
    said &quot;I was able to get into turns 3 &amp; 4 real smooth, but down
    there in turn one, there was a huge hole that really upset the car if you
    didn't get into the corner just right. I seen cars bouncing all over out
    there when they went through there, so I just tried to stay over top of
    it.&quot; As to whether or not he knew he was on the lead lap, Pierce
    replied, &quot;I really had no idea. I thought I was, and no one told me any
    different. Otherwise, I wouldn't have drove so hard there at the end,&quot;
    he said.</p>
    <p>For McDowell, it was his third UDTRA win of the season, and second
    consecutive after winning previously at Scenic Raceway in Oneida, TN. With
    the win McDowell collected $10,000 for the win, and following a season that
    had its' ups-and-downs, seemed quite pleased with his performance. &quot;I
    feel like there's a lot of people... I need to thank my crew and all my
    sponsors, and we did a new deal with Larry Shaw and Ken Hendrix of Larry
    Shaw Race Cars, and Mark Richards has played a key role (owner of Rocket
    Chassis), he's been a key supporter in our deal, and along with Rick Eckert
    and Steve Francis. All three of us work well together. I know the last
    couple of races we've seemed to benefit a little bit from working together,
    but you know the tables turn, and I think I owe them a lot of credit
    too,&quot; said McDowell. &quot;I just feel like learning the cars and
    making the right adjustments at the right time... and this deal's so
    competitive, you have to start in the right spot. I mean tonight we
    qualified sixth, and started front row outside, and that's where you needed
    to be,&quot; he added.</p>
    <p>Asked how difficult it was to come to a new venue such as Kankakee Motor
    Speedway for the first time, McDowell said, &quot;it's pretty difficult... a
    car spun and we got tore up in hotlaps, and only had one lap of practice
    then we qualified, but the crew did a great job getting the car back
    together. We didn't know how we were going to be, but things are going the
    right way for us now, so we're going to ride this horse as long as we
    can.&quot;</p>

    <p>Randy Korte of Highland, IL was the Advance Auto Parts Hard Charger of
    the Race after starting 23rd and finishing 15th in the Mid-Continental Fuel
    Rocket/Pro Power Grand Prix. Tankersley was the Lucas Oil Rookie of the Race
    finishing 17th.<br>
    <br>
    O'Neal set a new track record in qualifying with fast time honors among the
    47 entrants, touring the 1/3-mile high-banked dirt oval in 13.644 seconds
    for an average speed of 87.951 miles per hour. That broke the old record of
    13.675 seconds set by Moyer on August 31, 2001. Pohlman, McDowell, Mars and
    Babb took the four 12-lap heat race wins.<br>
    <br>
    Bloomquist won the first of two 12-lap Polaris ATVs Consolation Races, and
    Dennis Erb Jr. of Carpentersville, IL won the second consolation race in the
    B&amp;K Sportswear Rayburn/Bullock Monte Carlo.</p>
    <p>Post-race comments:</p>
    <p>Steve Francis -</p>
    <p>Give me your point of view as to what happened on the opening lap.</p>
    <p>&quot;Everybody was shooting for position, and I shot in and under Billy
    (Drake) and I don't think he actually knew I was there, and I had to kind of
    jack my car around and the rest of the field was right there on top of me. I
    seen Billy, he went out and down the straight-away, so I run up and inside
    the straight-away which made my corner a lot sharper than his, and out of
    the corner of my eye I seen him coming across, which he didn't know I was
    there, it wasn't an intentional deal, and he just barely touched the right
    front nose and when he did it just pulled my car right around, and stacked
    the field up behind us.&quot;</p>
    <p>You guys caught a lucky break there to come away unscathed from that
    whole deal.</p>
    <p>&quot;Well I think it bent the panhard bar and stuff, because we didn't
    have the same car that I felt we should of had. Yeah it hurt us, but we
    still finished.</p>
    <p>Are you pleased with your finish?</p>
    <p>&quot;No, we're a little disappointed, we should of had a better car than
    that. Just one of them deals where somedays you hit it right, and somedays
    you don't. We just a tick off, it wasn't a bad car, but it wasn't a good
    car.&quot;</p>
    <p>Bob Pohlman Jr. -</p>
    <p>After a strong run early on, you faded there towards the end. What
    happened?<br>
    &quot;I think we just chose the wrong tire. I went with a harder tire, and I
    think I could have gone a little softer. It was a gamble and it just didn't
    work out tonight. When your tires start to go away here, it's tough to keep
    the car straight, and you have to keep it straight here to go fast.</p>
    <p>Are you pleased with your performance otherwise?</p>
    <p>&quot;Yeah, I think we did real good despite that. We don't get to run
    with these guys very often. This was my first time racing these guys this
    year, and it was fun. We'll use this as a springboard in our program for the
    rest of the year, and try to get that track championship here this
    year.&quot;<br>

      </div>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    </font><i><font size="2">
    <p>by Paul D. Bayne</p>
    <p>National Dirt Digest Correspondent</p>
    </font></i><font size="2">
    <p>HARTFORD, MI (May 10) - Hartford Speedway Park in Hartford, MI was the
    scene for the sixth stop on the Sunoco American Late Model Series trail, and
    although brisk temperatures welcomed a throng of hungry race fans, it was
    Picconing's (MI) Jeep Van Wormer who set the place on fire and burned the
    competition to the sum of $3,000 and his first series win this year.</p>
    <p>While the old saying goes, &quot;you can't have your cake and eat it
    too&quot;, Van Wormer proved otherwise as he was celebrating his 27th
    birthday as well. Van Wormer, who started outside the sixth row, vaulted
    past Greg Johnson and around early race leader and polesitter Todd Nuding on
    lap nine and never looked back as he whistled away from the field over the
    final 21 circuits.</p>
    <p>The track known as &quot;The Wicked 1/2-mile&quot; certainly lived up to
    it's name throughout the night, but none more than on lap seven when Ryan
    Dauber of Tonica, IL broke and slammed virtually head-on into the
    backstretch wall. </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Dauber, who
    was making his first-ever appearance at the track, left it with a very
    bitter taste in his mouth. Debuting a brand new GRT chassis with zero laps,
    Dauber was explosive in his winning heat race performance, but things took a
    frightening turn for the worse in the early stages of the 30-lap event.</p>
    <p>While challenging for the lead alongside Nuding, Dauber's steering
    quickener locked up, turning the car abruptly to the right and sent the
    young Illinois hotshoe launching towards the outer barrier. &quot;We were
    going for the lead with the #07 car, when it just locked up. Wasn't nothing
    I could do at that point. Brand new car is D.O.A. now... $15,000 down the
    tubes,&quot; said Dauber in his post-crash comments.</p>
    <p>After surveying the damage to his car, it was easy to see that this car
    hadseen it's first and final night of racing. While much of the car itself
    is salvagable, the Sabata Racing Engine may not be so lucky. &quot;The motor
    is pushed back a good 8 inches&quot; added Dauber, who was lucky to escape
    with only a slight limp, and a instant headache. With the speeds attained at
    Hartford Speedway Park, it was very good to see Dauber walk away under his
    own power.</p>
    <p>When the race attempted to restart, Hillard Miller of Defiance, OH spun
    bringing out a second yellow flag. This allowed current Sunoco American Late
    Model Series point leader Johnson of Edinburgh, IN to move into the second
    spot, while Van Wormer sat in third. Johnson would momentarily seize the
    lead from Nuding, but Nuding answered the call powering past Johnson down
    the back straight-away. Both cars however, could not hold off Van Wormer who
    had took to the high side and found the quick way around.</p>
    <p>On lap 11, another incident followed in turn three involving Brian
    Stuart, Matt Mead, and Dave Brueckner. This allowed Joe Izzo the time needed
    to head to the pits to make some changes. Izzo's car looked strong early,
    but it quickly became apparent that he had missed the setup some as he
    three-wheeled his way through the corners and slowly faded back to 11th.</p>
    <p>While Dauber's race night was finished, he and his crew were able to lend
    a hand their fellow Illinois driver Izzo of LaSalle. Dauber assisted in
    making rear suspension and left rear tire changes to the Izzo machine while
    under the caution. When Izzo returned to the track, he found himself at the
    back of the field, before storming his way to an incredible fourth place
    finish.</p>
    <p>With the crossed flags high in the air indicating the half-way mark, Van
    Wormer had already opened up nearly a full straight-away advantage over
    Nuding, Johnson, Brian Ruhlman, and Hartford's own Curt Spaulding, who was
    piloting a back-up GRT chassis provided by fellow Michigander, and
    three-time ALMS champion Kris Patterson of St. John's.</p>
    <p>As the laps dwindled away and time running out, it became painfully
    obvious that no one was going to catch Van Wormer and the race for second
    was on. Johnson slipped past Nuding around lap 20, and Nuding began to
    slowly move backwards with what turned out to be a tire going down on the
    #07 machine. When the field took the checkered flag, it was Van Wormer
    picking up his first ALMS feature victory of the season, followed by
    Johnson, Ruhlman, Izzo, and Spaulding. Rounding out the top ten were Bill
    Hahn, Patterson, Shawn Toczek, Nuding, and Jeff Kohn.</p>
    <p>With the runner-up finish, Johnson strengthened his point lead over
    Ruhlman, and Patterson. Jerry Bowersock, who came into the event second in
    series points did not attend. Seven of the top ten in points were on hand,
    but only twenty-three cars signed in overall.</p>
    <p>Preliminary heat races saw Van Wormer take the first over Ruhlman, Izzo,
    and Hillard Miller. Jeff Kohn claimed the second heat over Nuding, Bill
    Hahn, and Spaulding, while Dauber grabbed the checkers in the third and
    final heat over Brian Tyler, Johnson, and Patterson. The top four cars from
    each heat transferred into the 30-lap main event, redrawing for position to
    set the top six rows. The next eight spots went to B main transferrers which
    included Kenny Hahn, winning the 12-lap event, &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Jim
    Kelly, Matt Mead, Brian Stuart, Dean Anderson, Tim Sabo, Dave Brueckner, and
    Greg Cooper. Ted Loomis and Shawn Toczek were added to the field as
    provisonals.</p>
    <p>Ron Miller was the only competitor unable to run the A main, but did more
    than his share for a fellow driver. Miller gave young super stock driver
    Adam Terry, a rear seal, so that the youngster could compete in his own
    scheduled main event. It was nice to see such a sportsmanlike gesture from
    such a good man, who found himself unable to compete with mechanical
    troubles.</p>
    <p>All in all, for being such a runaway of a race for the win, the race
    itself was packed with punch and excitement, and was actually very
    entertaining to watch.</font><font size="2"></p>

    <p>Odds &amp; Ends<br>
    Jeep Van Wormer - Van Wormer's winning combination included a Warrior
    chassis powered by Custom Race Engines. Starting 12th, he was up to 5th by
    lap 4, and into fourth one lap later. The &quot;Jeepster&quot;, or
    &quot;Spider-man&quot;, because of the large spider on his hauler and the
    back of his driver's suit, had the lead by lap 8 and never looked back. Van
    Wormer had won previously at Hartford in May of 2001. Van Wormer found a
    very smooth high line and proceeded to annihilate the field, winning by a
    full straight-away over Johnson. &quot;We really had no intentions of even
    racing this weekend. We were just going to stay home, with my birthday, and
    Mother's Day coming up. But I'm glad we came out and ran. The car felt
    really good right from the get-go,&quot; said Van Wormer.</p>
    <p>Van Wormer was celebrating his 27th birthday, and what better way to
    celebrate than to pad your wallet with $3,000 clams. Van Wormer had no crew
    chief tonight with the team's pending decision not to race this weekend, but
    quickly made the call to his crew chief to share news of the big win. Van
    Wormer's plans are to run in Monday's big UDTRA event at Kankakee Motor
    Speedway in Illinois, as well as, West Liberty, and Eagle Speedway in
    Nebraska.</p>
    <p>Ryan Dauber - Starting fourth, Dauber moved around both Bill Hahn and
    Hillard Miller on lap one to claim the second spot, and while going for the
    lead over Todd Nuding, had the steering quickener lock up on him resulting
    in a head on crash into the backstretch wall. Brand new Dauber Company Inc.
    /MidStatesTrucking/ GRT/ Sabata/Monte Carlo car is destroyed. Motor was sent
    back eight inches. Dauber escaped with a slight limp, and surely a sore
    noggin'. &quot;I just had the wind knocked out of me, and hit my head pretty
    good,&quot; said Dauber.</p>
    <p>Dauber's crash was indeed frightening. One observer said &quot;I can't
    recall ever seeing a car turn so quickly to the right and colliding with the
    wall that hard. It's amazing he wasn't seriously hurt&quot;. The incident
    was indeed head-on, and resulted with the front end of the car becoming a
    twisted heap. The race was red-flagged at that point for better than ten
    minutes. It was the first night out on the new car, and Ryan had not even
    sat in the car until hotlaps were run. The car sported no decals and was
    dressed out in the #64 made out of good ole duct tape. The crew worked
    frantically after arriving to the track late, to make body changes to meet
    UMP rules. The new car was one in which Dauber had hoped to run some
    upcoming UDTRA events with. Dauber was outstanding in his heat race and
    looked very strong early on in the A main.</p>
    <p>Joe Izzo - The 2001 UDTRA Rookie-of-the-Year, started eighth and moved
    into a battle for the sixth position, before back-pedalling to as far as the
    11th spot. Izzo pitted on lap 7 after a caution came out for a turn 3 crash.
    Joe delighted the large crowd with a three-wheel salute throughout the
    night, but was more than even he had bargained for. Izzo pulled his car to
    the Dauber pit for assistance in rear suspension (adjustment of rear panhard
    bar) and a left rear tire, which he had loaned to Dauber prior to the race.
    He returned to run from the back of the pack to claim fourth. He appeared to
    have the second fastest car to Van Wormer, who had simply checked out. The
    Illinois trio of Izzo, Dauber, and Loomis worked very well supporting one
    another. &quot;We changed some spring rates after the heat race to try and
    get the car to settle down a bit. We came here to get some laps in and
    hopefully apply what we learn to the UMP summer nationals race here in
    July,&quot; said Izzo. Izzo's legendary father Tony, was on hand to lend
    helpful advice and route on his son with wife Kerri Ann.</p>
    <p>Curt Spaulding - Curt Spaulding is certainly no stranger to going fast at
    Hartford Speedway Park. Driving a Kris Patterson back-up GRTcar, Spaulding
    started ninth and consistently ran in the top five throughout the bulk of
    the race. The former IMCA modified track champion has had seat time in Terry
    Eaglin owned cars on several occasions this year, but this was by far his
    best overall performance of the season in the late model.</p>
    <p>Shawn Toczek - The Hebron, IN native was plagued by bad luck all night.
    After suffering flat tires in both his heat and B main, Toczek was added to
    the field as a provisional. He started tail on the grid (22nd), and stormed
    his way to an eighth place finish. &quot;I thought I could have done maybe a
    little better, but we're still trying to figure out the new Warrior
    chassis,&quot; said Toczek. &quot;We're definitely moving in the right
    direction, but I'm happy with eighth tonight&quot;.</p>
    <p>Todd Nuding - Nuding, of Holland, OH, started on the pole but slowly
    faded towards the end of the 30-lapper due to a flat right rear tire.
    &quot;I knew something was wrong with the car, but just tried to ride it
    out. We went about ten laps on it and hung on just to finish,&quot; said
    Nuding. Nuding's plans are to run the entire ALMS slate and challenge for
    the title at season's end.</p>
    <p>Ted Loomis - Loomis of Kingston, IL, was also making his first-ever
    appearance at Hartford. Loomis was involved in a B main battle for the lead
    with Tim Sabo, and the two made contact out of turn four which sent Sabo
    slapping off the front-stretch wall, while Loomis suffered a bent steering
    rack. Although Loomis couldn't overcome the problem, he was able to take the
    green and record one lap before pulling off.</p>

    <p><font size="4">Recently, prior to the running of the UMP Hoosier Series
    event, at Vermilion County Speedway in Danville, IL, I had the chance to
    catch up with late model driver Steve Hillard and talk with him about the
    events of a year ago, and what lies ahead in 2002. I found the 35-year-old
    Northern Allstars runner-up of a season ago, and a former UMP National
    Champion (1997), to be one of the most approachable and down-to-earth folks
    you could ever hope to meet at the track. Steve grew up in Champaign, IL,
    but shortly after graduation, he and his family moved to Sadorus, IL, where
    they now call home.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">Steve is the kind of person who I think best reflects the
    motto, &quot;winning isn't everything, but it's how you play the game that
    counts.&quot; Steve understands the importance of professionalism, and goes
    about his business in exactly that same manner. He understands his actions
    not only reflect on him and his family, but also his crew, and most of all
    his sponsors, for whom without, racing simply wouldn't as possible. Steve
    has had fans in the stands get up and take notice over the past several
    years, and this year is no exception. He hopes to gain more exposure this
    year by competing in more national type events with the best of the best.</font></p>

    <i>
    <p><font size="4">&quot;My dad had street stocks, sportsmens... they kind of
    had a combined class back then. My dad was a multi-track champion. We were
    fortunate enough at that age... my dad had two cars, and he let me drive one
    while he drove the other&quot;, Hillard said. &quot;I won a teen race when I
    was 13, and I started driving in regular competition when I was 14 the
    following year. We won the track championship at Farmer City that
    year&quot;.</font></p>
    </i>
    <p><font size="4">How long have you been driving late models?</font></p>
    <i>
    <p><font size="4">&quot;This is my fifth year. 1997 was our last year in the
    (open-wheel) modifieds. We won the UMP National Championship deal in it.
    That year we had... well it'd be tough to top that year. We won the track
    championships at Farmer City, Fairbury, and Vermilion County. Then we won
    the Illinois State Championship and the National title as well. So it was a
    phenomenal year&quot;</font></p>
    </i>
    <p><font size="4">What was it like to run the Northern All Stars last year?</font></p>
    <i>
    <p><font size="4">&quot;It was a good year. I mean we had a lot of fun and
    we did okay on the money deal, and we just got out on the road and enjoyed
    ourselves. We never won a feature, but we were competitive every night.
    (Steve) Barnett never won either until right there towards the end. We about
    pulled one off a couple of times, but I didn't feel bad running second to
    Steve (Barnett) because he has so much experience over me. It was a big
    disappointment by losing it because of the tire battle. We had a big tire
    battle going on between Hoosier and American Racing Tire. Ultimately we lost
    the championship because a tire went flat, but it had a whole in it so it
    was no fault of the tire, we just picked up something on the racetrack. The
    other crusher was that it happened here at home (Danville's Vermilion Co.
    Speedway)&quot;.</font></p>
    </i>
    <p><font size="4">You entered the NALMS season finale with a 35 point lead
    over Steve Barnett. How disappointing was it to have that slip away on that
    final night?</font></p>
    <i>
    <p><font size="4">&quot;That's probably the toughest thing in racing I've
    ever had to deal with. I had to do the gentlemanly thing and walk across the
    infield and congratulate Steve. I felt that was the only thing to do, so I
    did. It wasn't hard to congratulate him because Steve's a good guy, it was
    hard dealing with the defeat. Because along the way I just started thinking
    of things I could have done differently. Hindsight is 20-20, and I sure had
    a head full of it that night. I mean... I thought I should have done this or
    I should have done that, but we lost and we still had a good time&quot;.</font></i></p>
    <p><font size="4">You're off to a pretty good start here in 2002. What's
    been the biggest difference thus far?</font></p>
    <i>
    <p><font size="4">&quot;We won opening night at Farmer City, and that's our
    only win so far, but we've been real competitive every night out. Right now
    the major difference is the engine program. We've switched from Hixson
    Engines to Gaerte Race Engines out of Rochester, IN, and Joe (Gaerte) and
    all the people up there are just fantastic to deal with. The engines are, I
    hesitate to say better, because we never had any engine trouble with Butch's
    (Hixson) engines, and I like Butch, he's a good guy, but Gaerte's engines
    have just got so much more horsepower and they're so much more driver
    friendly. They're easy to drive&quot;.</font></p>
    </i>
    <p><font size="4">What was the reason for the change in the engine program?</font></p>
    <i>
    <p><font size="4">&quot;Well the people who actually owned the engines last
    year, decided that they wanted to get out. Doug's not in the best of health,
    so he decided he wanted to get out and just go and watch and not have the
    worries of having to pay the bills if something broke. So we went looking
    for a deal, and Roger Friedman, who owns Dyer Rod's, knew I was looking for
    a deal, so he told me I should go talk with Joe Gaerte and that they had a
    program going, so that's what I did. It worked out that ourselves and
    Wendall Wallace are doing the Gaerte deal, and at this point I couldn't be
    any happier. Their just fantastic people who really know what they're
    doing&quot;.</font></p>
    </i>
    <p><font size="4">Tell us about the chassis and some of your sponsors?</font></p>
    <i>
    <p><font size="4">&quot;Well</font></i><font size="4"> </font><i><font size="4">we
    got 2 brand new Mastersbilt chassis'. Keith and Tader(Masters) and all the
    people there, they just do whatever we ask. I can't tell you how much I've
    learned from those guys in the last two or three years. They're phenomenal
    people but they're also very intelligent about race cars. I go to their
    chassis seminar every year and I learn something everytime I go. I talk to
    Keith on the phone frequently, and he's taught me a lot about race
    cars&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">&quot;Our other sponsors, we got several who have been
    with us for quite a while now. We got The Deadhorse Lounge - Nelson Video -
    F/S Fuel 24 - Dyer Rod's - BRT Racks - Sunoco Fuels - Petit's BP Fuel Stores
    - PFM Race Fuels &amp; Race Metals - R.A. Benson Motorsports - UB Machine -
    Tatman's Towing. The Tatman's Towing deal, that's more 'cause I have no
    choice but to put Bill (Nelson) on the car because he's the co-owner (along
    with Hillard). He's my best friend, and he said wherever you go, I go. So
    that's the way our friendship is, and that's the way our arrangement is with
    the race car. He does what he can to help us, and quite honestly, a lot of
    the sponsors on the car he's went out and gotten. I'm not real good at
    talking about a lot of stuff, and Bill's got the gift of gab, so he goes out
    and hustles and gets us the sponsors. He just a great guy. There's only one
    other sponsor I need to mention, we got Bert transmissions and Larry Redinus,
    his nickname is &quot;Budda&quot;, everyone knows him by &quot;Budda&quot;.
    He supplies us with all our transmissions and bell housings. He's done a lot
    of other things for me other than just transmissions and bell housings, and
    he's just one we can always count on&quot;.</font></p>
    </i>
    <p><font size="4">What about this battle you mentioned between Hoosier and
    American Race Tires?</font></p>
    <i>
    <p><font size="4">&quot;Well, that's my biggest beef with the Northern
    Allstars. It's not anything to do with the product. I mean the tire
    companies, they both have good products... don't get me wrong. I think
    American Race Tire has got a better product in some events. It's kind of
    like once you get so big you get complacent, and I think that's what Hoosier
    has done, and quite honestly, they know that guys have to run them. Whereas,
    American Race Tires, they're out hustling and busting their butts trying to
    get things rolling, and they've came up with a better product, and that's
    some of the things we worked on last year&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">&quot;With Northern Allstars, Tony Rose, Dayton
    Enterprises, American Race Tires, however you want to word it. They
    sponsored NALMS from the very first year of existence, and then last year
    they just dropped American Race Tires from their program without any
    warning, without consulting with them, without offering them a choice. It's
    just the way it went down, it's just the way it happened. That's what really
    bothers me&quot;.</font></p>
    </i>
    <p><font size="4">You felt that American Race Tire and yourself were dealt a
    low blow?</font></p>
    <i>
    <p><font size="4">&quot;Exactly. It was kind of like kicking them in the
    crotch. It was a REAL low blow, because originally they wanted to do it at
    the banquet. It was Terry Young from Hoosier that recommended they not do
    it, because he knew that it would just start a ruckus. I think we're all
    professional enough to know that wouldn't have happened, but it sure would
    have made for an uncomfortable evening I know that. I just have a bad taste
    in my mouth with Mr. Linville himself, and that's the only person because he
    the sole decision maker&quot;.</font></p>
    </i>
    <p><font size="4">What are your plans for the rest of the 2002 season?</font></p>
    <i>
    <p><font size="4">&quot;Well we're really not going to commit to any one
    series, we're going to try and just hit and miss, try to make some money,
    get some more exposure, get out and see what we can do. We'll definitely go
    to both events at Eldora - The Dream &amp; The World 100 - we may be at the
    Show-Me 100, and then we may show up at a few of the UDTRA races. I'd kind
    of like to get my feet wet running with those guys. We'll be running a
    couple Renegade DirtCar events. We'll most likely be at Kankakee next Monday
    (May 13th) when UDTRA comes to Kankakee. There's a lot of races we can go to
    and hopefully make the show. I don't know, we'll just try and see what we
    can do&quot;.</font></p>
    </i>
    <p><font size="4">Is there any type of track you prefer to race on?</font></p>
    <i>
    <p><font size="4">&quot;I kind of like this place (Vermilion Co. Speedway).
    Danville is 3/8th's, I kind of like the 3/8th's stuff the best, and the
    slicker it gets the better off. I don't really like the slick, but it's
    easier on equipment and you really have to finesse. The guys with the
    biggest engine and the best tires, basically I mean if you got a whole lot
    of horsepower and new tires on your car, and you can even get it close to
    hooked up, you can be fast in the mud. Because all you really have to do is
    kind of point it and hammer down. But in the dry slick you really got to
    finesse the car. I mean the best there is, Billy Moyer, Scott Bloomquist,
    Bob Pierce, you name it, you could go on down the list, but those guys shine
    when the track gets slick. So if I'm ever going to be someone in this sport
    that's where I need to be good, and that's what we work on&quot;.</font></p>
    </i>
    <p><font size="4">You tagged the wall pretty good Friday night. What was the
    damage and is the car ready to go tonight?</font></p>
    <i>
    <p><font size="4">&quot;Yeah, we got everything fixed. It ended up we just
    bent a spindle and tore up a wheel. The reason it happened is just the
    driver ran out of talent. I just charged the corner too hard and hit the
    wall&quot;.</font></p>
    </i>
    <p><font size="4">Who has been perhaps the biggest influence in your racing
    career?</font></p>
    <i>
    <p><font size="4">&quot;I would have to say the biggest influence is my
    father, Alex. He gave me my start, and he's always there to tell me what
    I've done wrong... when I've done good&quot;.</font></p>
    </i>
    <p><font size="4">Is there any one driver you look to for advice?</font></p>
    <i>
    <p><font size="4">&quot;I used to, but right now I don't know that I've got
    anyone I go to. If I've got a question I need to know about the race car, I
    go to MasterSbilt. If I've got one about the engines, I go to Gaerte. If
    I've got a question about the car I'll ask my dad (Alex), or Aaron Jones.
    Aaron's been with me for the last 8 years. Then we've got John Olson and
    Richard Fitzgerald, and usually if I'm running the wrong line I can come in
    and ask one of those guys and they'll tell me. My wife keeps lap times.
    Every lap we run, she's got on a stopwatch, if she's able to go, because our
    girls are at the age now where they can go and do some sporting events.
    They're into soccer and softball, so it makes it tough on me when she's not
    there because I can go ask her, was the top faster? Was the bottom faster?
    How'd I look in the middle? And she can tell me because she's right on the
    money with the stop watch&quot;.</font></p>

    <p>CROWN POINT, IN (May 3) - Crown Point Speedway held it's 2002 season
    opening racing program Saturday night with optimism running wild now that
    local businessman and UMP open-wheel ace Tony Roland has assumed the reigns
    of promoting the 1/3-mile semi-banked facility in Northwest Indiana. With
    many changes already made and many more still to come, a total of 79 cars
    filed into the pits for some high-flyin dirt track action.</p>
    <p>Headlining the racing program were the mighty UMP late models, and when
    all was said and done at evening's end, it was the ageless Dick Potts of
    Morocco, IN scoring his 521st career feature win. Potts, who started outside
    pole, assumed the early lead from the drop of the green flag as polesitter
    Eddie Leviner of Merrillvile, IN went spinning into the infield on the
    opening lap. However, Bensonville's (IL) Frank Reaber, the 2001 Northern All
    Stars Rookie of the Year, would claim that top spot by the completion of lap
    one, and seemingly look to have things well in hand.</p>
    <p>On lap four, Dave Lilja collected the turn three wall, prompting
    officials to display the yellow flag. As action resumed, Reaber had his
    hands full of Potts, with Scott Martin of Valparaiso, IN in tow. One lap
    later, the yellow flag was waved again for Bart Schwartz, who had looped it
    in turn two. When green flag racing resumed and the field began to sort
    themsleves out, Reaber had now opened up his lead to about ten car lengths
    over Potts, Martin, Al Atkinson, and Phil Gerlach. At the half-way mark of
    the 20-lap event, the lineup remained the same, but on lap 11 Atkinson moved
    around Martin and into the third spot, dropping Martin to fourth.</p>
    <p>Reaber began to close in on the backmarkers on lap 12, and one lap later
    was collected by Scott Duvall and Bill Luse, who had tangled coming off of
    turn two. A disappointed Reaber had seen a great run cut short by being in
    the wrong place at the wrong time. With Potts now inheriting the lead, and
    Atkinson on his heels, the field was set for a sprint to the finish.
    Atkinson, the 2001 late model track champion at Crown Point, worked to the
    high side, while Potts protected the bottom, and the two went nose-to-nose
    until Atkinson was able to get a run on Potts coming off of turn two on lap
    17 and vault into the lead. However, Atkinson would see his chance for
    victory fall by the wayside when he slowed and pulled his car to the infield
    with a flat left rear tire with two go.</p>
    <p>Shawn Toczek had worked his way around Gerlach and into the third
    position just prior to Atkinson's setback, and looked to be closing in some
    on the second-place car of Martin. Toczek, driving a new Warrior chassis,
    had come from the twelfth-place starting spot, while Gerlach started 11th.
    But both would run out of time to reel in the leaders.</p>
    <p>As the checkered flag fell, Potts scored the win with Martin well back in
    second, Toczek third, with Gerlach and Leviner, fourth and fifth,
    respectively. Rounding out the top ten were Mike Metz, Mike Kingma, Guy
    Volk, Luse, and Bill Reiniche.</p>
    <p>Taking heat race honors were Metz, Atkinson, and Leviner, while Brad
    Schwartz claimed the consi win. Potts also scored a trophy dash triumph in
    addition to his feature win. Scott Martin twinkled the timing lights in
    qualifying with a blistering lap of 12.621.</p>
    <p>In UMP open-wheel action, it was Tommy Kroll of Illinois, registering the
    win over Crown Point's Matt Rhyne by less than a half-car length at the
    stripe. Kroll, starting from the pole position, wasted no time letting the
    field know who was going to be in charge of this contest throughout. As the
    race progressed, Kevin Hastings would spin in turn two on lap 4, collecting
    Mike Oldenberg, Randy Purcell, Dick Wood, and Ed Gardner in the process. All
    were able to continue, though slowly one by one they all seemed to fall out
    with mechanical problems, with the exception of Wood.</p>
    <p>Bill Davis of Chesterton, IN gave Kroll all the &quot;Buzzard&quot; he
    could handle, and then some, but each time Kroll was simply too strong down
    the straight-aways. The man on the move though was Rhyne, who was utilizing
    the upper line for all it was worth. Kroll however didn't waver, as he
    gripped to the bottom of the track forcing others to go high to beat him.
    And though Rhyne was able to capitalize and close in on Kroll, it was Kroll
    who had outfoxed the field.</p>
    <p>Scott Martin, pulled double-duty on the night, driving the Buzzard house
    car and looked to be quite stout himself early on. It wasn't until Martin
    and Jason Potts got together in turn two with five to go, that Martin's
    strong performance was cut short. Potts was able to continue and work his
    way up to a seventh-place finish.</p>
    <p>Kroll was just barely able to fend off Rhyne at the line, while Davis,
    Wood, and Phil Line all garnered top five finishes. Rounding out the top ten
    were Roger Duszynski, Potts, Bill Wise, Purcell, and Mick Roach.</p>
    <p>Heat race winners included Purcell, Rusty Pleasant, and Kroll. Kroll also
    took the trophy dash win, while Jimmy Walker won the consolation race. Bill
    Davis set quick time in qualifying, chiming in with a 14.123 effort.</p>
    <p>Both street stocks and mini stocks were unable to get their feature races
    in due to a track curfew, but will get to make those features up next week.
    Both features will be run at the start of the night.</p>
    <p>In the street stock heats races, Rich Shirey, Tim Walter, and Bob McLean
    all scored wins, while Valparaiso resident Glenn Coppage topped the
    consolation race. Shirey was victorious in the street stcok trophy dash as
    well.</p>
    <p>In mini-stock action, Mike Rhoades and Ron Ogborn each visited victory
    lane in heat races, while doubled up by winning the mini stock trophy dash.</p>
    <p>Only those cars that qualified for the street stock and mini stock
    features, will be allowed to race in the make-up races to take place next
    Saturday night.</p>

      <p>SCHERERVILLE, Ind (April 28) - Brian Ross of nearby Plymouth, IN, drove
      his Badlands Offroad Park/LA Custom/Ultra-Tech Race Engines/Ford to
      reclaim the lead for good on lap 199 over early race front-runner Marty
      Lindley, and went to record his first career USAR Hooter's ProCup Series
      victory in only his second start, in the Miller Lite 250 at Illiana Motor
      Speedway Sunday afternoon. With the win, Ross earned $11,500 including
      contingency awards, and assumed the top spot in the Northern division
      points chase.</p>
      <p>Several hundred race fans braved some frigid temperatures made worse by
      the gusting Southeast winds, but what they witnessed between Ross and
      Lindley was nothing short of pure dominance. Lindley, who hails from a
      warmer climate known as Taylors, SC, and Ross, who lives an hour or so due
      East of Illiana, both appeared to be out for a &quot;Sunday drive&quot;,
      as they battled all race long with each other, and quite frankly, no one
      else.</p>
      <p>Because qualifications were rained out on Saturday, the lineup was
      determined by the 2002 current point standings. Lindley, the race winner
      at the first USAR Hooter's ProCup event in Jennerstown, PA back on April
      13th, would thus start from the pole. Along side of him was Durham, NC
      driver Jay Fogleman.</p>
      <p>From the drop of the green flag Lindley set the tone for what looked to
      be an otherwise flawless run. Ross, who started fourth, immediately worked
      his way around Forrest Urban of Richmond, VA and Fogleman up into second
      place. Ross took over the top spot on lap 45 and began to open up a slight
      lead over Lindley, though Lindley would never let Ross get more than
      several car lengths out front. With the halfway mark approaching, and
      contingency money on the line for leading at the half-way mark, Lindley
      again turned up the wick and worked his way under Ross on lap 109. The two
      raced side by side for several laps without ever touching and giving each
      other the utmost respect.</p>
      <p>As the pit window approached for fuel and tires, Lindley and Ross both
      pitted on lap 134. The two drivers took a different approach on pit
      strategy as Lindley took all four tires and fuel in one stop, while Ross
      took right side tires first, then repitted for left side tires and fuel
      just moments later. &quot;We was pretty tight there in the first session,
      and we loosened it up during the pit stop a bit, and we still ended up a
      little tight. But I think Marty (Lindley) was a little bit tighter than we
      was,so it worked out pretty good,&quot; said Ross. Both strategies went
      like clockwork and seemed to worked to perfection. Veteran driver Lonnie
      Rush of Pickerington, OH assumed the lead on lap 134 when the two leaders
      made their stops. Fogleman then took over the top spot from Rush on lap
      141, and would lead the next twenty-two circuits before Lindley and Ross
      were able to work back through the field on lap 163. The cat and mouse
      chase between Lindley and Ross was set with 87 laps remaining.</p>
      <p>On lap 199, Ross drove in under Lindley and powered his way past
      Lindley and into the lead for good. Lindley tried to fight back but began
      to lose ground to Ross until the late stages of the race when Lindley
      started reeling in Ross once again. However, on lap 240 Lindley appeared
      to slow as he moved through turn two and began coasting down the long back
      straightaway at Illiana. As he limped his car around the track and into
      the pit area, it appeared Lindley's fine run had come to an end.</p>
      <p>Ross now had smooth sailing ahead and better than a half a lap lead
      over Eric Corbett of Hagerstown, MD who now had inherited the runner-up
      spot from Lindley. Fogleman was a distant third, and the last car to
      remain on the lead lap, while Canadian driver Jamie McLellan and Charlie
      Ford of Charles City, VA rounded out the top five. Also having top ten
      runs on the day were Gary Bedell, who started 32nd and won the Hard
      Charger Award for improving his position twenty-six spots, Philip Rondeau,
      Rush, Urban, and John Gaunt. Corbett seemed quite pleased with his
      runner-up finish in only his second outing with the series. &quot;Our car
      was good all day, though not quite as good as Jennerstown last week,&quot;
      he said. &quot;Brian (Ross) and Marty (Lindley) certainly had the cars to
      beat all day here,&quot; added Corbett.</p>
      <p>In all, eighteen of the thirty-two drivers entered were rookies with
      the USAR Hooter's ProCup Series, and twelve of them finished the race in
      the top twenty. There were 11 caution periods during the race, including
      two red flag situations, that accounted for a total of 81 laps. There were
      six lead changes among four different drivers on the day with Ross leading
      116 laps, Lindley 105, Fogleman 22, and Rush 7.</p>
      <p>The USAR Hooter's ProCup Series moves due south to Winchester, IN next
      Sunday, May 5th for another 250-lap event. Race time is slated for 1:30pm.</p>
      <p>Speed Channel will re-broadcast today's race on May 2nd at 8:00pm, May
      3rd at 12:00am and again at 11:00am. All times Central.</p>

      <p>In other action, the Illiana late models held a 30-lap event of their
      own following the USAR event. Only twelve cars braved the cold weather
      with Brian Ross pulling double-duty. Polesitter and three-time track
      champion Mike White jumped out to an slim advantage over Erik Darnell with
      Bobby Gash and Mike Martin in tow. Long-time late model standout and
      multi-time track champion Dave Weltmeyer moved by Martin and into fourth
      on lap two.</p>
      <p>Darnell edged past White on the outside to claim the lead on lap three,
      but would see that lead disappear one lap later as White reclaimed the
      lead. Both Weltmeyer and Boris Jurkovic worked their way past Gash for the
      third and fourth spots respectively on lap four. Meanwhile Ross, was
      working his way up through the field from the 11th starting position on
      the grid.</p>
      <p>Jurkovic was able to get by both Darnell and Weltmeyer by lap nine and
      move into second. At the halfway mark it remained White, Jurkovic,
      Darnell, Ross, and Weltmeyer up front. Just after the field took the
      crossed flags indicating the half-way point of the race, Gash spun in turn
      one while racing side by side with Martin, thus bringing out the first and
      only caution of the event to clean up debris left behind from the Gash
      machine.</p>
      <p>When the race resumed Ross and Weltmeyer engaged in battle for the
      fourth position. Ross slipped a bit in turn two but was able to thwart off
      the challenge made by Weltmeyer as the two exited turn two on lap 17.
      However, just one lap later, Ross again slipped entering turn one and
      dropped four spots back to eighth. Jurkovic was able to get by White on
      lap 18, and takeover the lead as the two entered turn three.</p>
      <p>2001 track champion Steve Moenck hustled his way past Martin and into
      sixth on lap 24. With five to go, White pulled to the inside of Jurkovic
      and looked to regain the lead. White pulled ahead slightly as the two made
      their way down the back-stretch with four to go. Moenck meanwhile, pulled
      past Weltmeyer and into fourth with Darnell running all by himself in
      third. Ross, also was able to move past Weltmeyer to reclaim the fifth
      spot.</p>
      <p>With White and Jurkovic now better than a straight-away lead over third
      place Darnell, the duo chased one another over the final lap, and not
      until turn three did it seem the outcome was determined. At the line it
      was White, driving the Auburn Supply/ Quality Plumbing/Rhyne Competition
      Engines/Monte Carlo, picking up the win, with Jurkovic second, Darnell
      third, Moenck fourth, and Ross fifth. Rounding out the field were
      Weltmeyer, Martin, Joe O'Connor, Gash, Duke Nalon, and Phil Bretz. Jim
      Malinowski finished twelfth after mechanical problems sidelined him just
      after the halfway point.</p>
      <p>Racing action resumes next Saturday night at Illiana with a Mother's
      Day special featuring a full program of late models, Mid-American
      sportsmen, super stocks, and turbo stocks. Pit gates open at 3pm, front
      gates at 4pm, with the first race slated for 7pm. For more information

        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        </font><i><font size="2">

        </font></i><font size="2">
        <p>KANKAKEE, Ill. (April 26, 2002) With $2,000 up for grabs, there's
        always bound to be a few travelers pull into the pits, but one
        unexpected guest pulled and simply stole the show. Shannon Babb, the
        young Illinois phenom known as &quot;The Decatur Invader&quot;outclassed
        a field of 37 total late models en route to scoring a popular, and
        dominant win over fellow Illinois hotshoe Bob Pierce, and Wisconsin
        native Russ Scheffler.</p>
        <p>Babb, driving the Car City/Petroff Towing/Rayburn/Jay Dickens/Monte
        Carlo, started on the pole of the 30-lap event and led every lap en
        route to claiming the $2,000 top prize. The only caution of the race
        would come on the first lap when Doug McCammon sat spun in turn one,
        thus prompting track officials to call for a complete restart. When
        green flag racing resumed Babb wasted no time in pulling out ahead of
        Scheffler down the backstretch while others sorted things out behind the
        twosome.</p>
        <p>Ten laps into the contest, it was Babb showing the way with Scheffler,
        Bob Pohlman Jr., Frank Reaber, and Pierce in tow. By lap 13, Babb was
        beginning to close in on the backmarkers, the first of which was Bret
        Sievert. Two circuits later at the halfway mark, it was still Babb,
        Scheffler, and Pohlman Jr. up front, with Pierce, who had moved around
        Reaber on lap 14, now in fourth.</p>
        <p>By lap 20, Pierce had worked his way underneath Pohlman Jr. for the
        third spot and began to stalk Scheffler for second. On lap 23, John
        Provenzano, who was having a top ten run, pulled to the infield with
        mechanical woes, thus ending a good run for him. On lap 25, Pierce
        slipped by Scheffler for second and set his sights on Babb, who by this
        time was barely within sight. With five to go and time not on Pierce's
        side, Babb gingerly worked his way slower lap traffic and coasted to an
        impressive win over Pierce, Scheffler, Pohlman Jr., and Jay Fiene. Fiene
        put together an impressive run after starting 11th on the grid. Pierce,
        who started eighth, was making his first start of 2002, and showed no
        signs of rust as he worked his Kankakee magic to climb up to the
        runner-up slot.</p>
        <p>Rounding out the top ten were Kevin Weaver (started 14th), Reaber,
        Richie Hedrick, Eddie Leviner, and 2001 track champion Corey Turner.</p>
        <p>Mark Ziesmer won heat race number one over Jim Laws, Jason Bogle, and
        Roy Mitchell.</p>
        <p>Doug McCammon captured heat two over Clint Hines, Frank Heckenast,
        and Larry Stotts.</p>
        <p>Ted Loomis won heat three over Gary May, Kevin Weaver, and Chris
        Carlson.</p>
        <p>Bob Pierce took heat four over Corey Turner, Russ Scheffler, and
        Richie Hedrick.</p>
        <p>Chuck Dixon won the first of two last chance races over Stotts, and
        McCammon, while Bret Sievert scored the win over Loomis, and Carlson in
        the latter.</p>
        <p>Shannon Babb won the late model dash over Russ Scheffler, Bob Pohlman
        Jr., and John Provenzano.</p>
        <p>Babb, who went out early in qualifying, was the only driver to crack
        the 14-second mark, and did so on both attempts with a best of 13.809
        setting the standard for the night.</p>
        <p>In UMP open-wheeled action it was Lance Dehm of Chatsworth, IL
        overtaking early race leader Dave Porth with four laps to go, then hold
        on for the season-opening win at the 1/3-mile speedplant. Porth,
        piloting a new Pierce chassis, would lead the opening 16 laps before
        Dehm was able to muscle by on the inside in his new Hoffman chassis
        sponsored by Livingston Stone, Pontiac RV, and Bryan Fehr Trucking.</p>
        <p>The first caution of the event came on lap 2 when the Hastings
        brothers, Kevin and Jason, got stacked up along with fellow competitor
        Kyle Cooper in turn one. Only Jason hastings was unable to continue. On
        lap four, the second yellow came out for debris on the racetrack. One
        lap later, Dan Drogemuller brought out the caution yet again when he
        looped his mount in turn three, thus ending his night with handling
        problems.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, a nifty battle waged on for the third and fourth spots
        throughout most of the contest between Aaron Ricketts, Kyle Logue, R.J.
        Gall, and Bob Pohlman Jr. Ricketts was able to hold them off for most of
        the race, but gave way to Gall late in the race, only to have Gall slip
        off the high side of turn two on the very next lap. Logue then went to
        work on Ricketts for third and made the pass, only to have the caution
        come out on lap 16 when Mike Porth sat facing the front-stretch wall
        just out of the turn four exit.</p>
        <p>Logue, after being sent back to fourth, once again set his sights on
        Ricketts for third, and made the pass one lap later while Gall and
        Pohlman Jr. battled for the fifth spot. Gall was able to work the high
        side just enough to get by Ricketts off of turn four as the checkered
        flag waved. At the stripe it was Dehm holding off Porth, followed by
        Logue, Gall, and Ricketts. Rounding out the top ten were Pohlman Jr.,
        fast qualifier Tommy Kroll, Jim Ferris, Matt Bachmann, and Jerry Danford.</p>
        <p>Dave Rudisill won the first of three heat races over Kevin Davis,
        Randy Purcell, and Phil Line.</p>
        <p>Kyle Cooper won heat two over Jerry Danford, Mick Roach, and Jerald
        Meier.</p>
        <p>Matt Bachmann captured the third and final heat over Kyle Logue, Jim
        Ferris, and Bob Pohlman Jr.</p>
        <p>Joel Funk won the last chance consolation event, with Kyle Cooper,
        Mick Roach, and Dave Rudisill also advancing to the 20-lap A main.</p>
        <p>Dave Porth claimed the modified dash over Aaron Ricketts, R.J. Gall,
        and Matt Rhyne.</p>
        </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
        <p>Roger Duszinski won the tough luck award on the night, after he
        flipped his way just after he completed his qualifying run. Duszinski
        escaped slightly shaken but not stirred.</p>
        </font><font size="2">
        <p>Billy Wicker of Bradley, IL won the wild and wooly street stock
        feature, as he moved past Kevin Lenzen with several laps to go when the
        two became entangled in a maze of lap traffic. John Geary led the
        opening lap of the race until he sailed off the high side of turn two
        resulting in the race's only caution. Matt Cleary then inherited the
        point being chased by both Lenzen and Wicker. Cleary himself became a
        victim of the lap traffic as he had to relinquish the lead to Lenzen on
        lap nine. Shannon Shutter moved past Cleary for third with seven laps to
        go, and actually closed in on Lenzen and Wicker, who were still fighting
        off lap cars.</p>
        <p>With three to go and Lenzen out front, Wicker looked low while Lenzen
        took to the top side around two slower cars. Wicker was able to thread
        his way by the backmarkers just a touch more easily than Lenzen as the
        two entered turn one with now just two laps remaining. That would prove
        to be the difference in what otherwise could be described as a chess
        match between the top two point getters from a year ago. Last year, with
        the season championship on the line, it came down to the final race of
        the season to determine who would reign track champion. Lenzen fell that
        night with a flat rear tire before the race really began and Wicker
        struggled himself to the championship points title.</p>
        <p>When starter Jim Whittington waved the final checkered flag on the
        night, it was Wicker squeeking by Lenzen for the win, followed by
        Shutter, Cleary, and Jay Hamilton, while A.J. Dixon, Jay Morris, Jeff
        Momper, John Geary, and Lee Hall rounded out the top ten.</p>
        <p>Heat races were won by Shutter over Cleary, Mike Estrada, and
        Hamilton in heat one.</p>
        <p>Geary scored the win in heat two over Joe Buyno, Neil Martin, and Tim
        Boots.</p>
        <p>Kevin Lenzen won heat three over A.J. Dixon, Billy Wicker, and Jay
        Morris.</p>
        <p>Geary also won the street stock dash over Lenzen, Hamilton, Wicker,
        and Momper. The dash was set by the top five in points from a season
        ago.</p>

    <br>
    by Paul D. Bayne<br>
    <br>
    FARMER CITY, IL (April 19) - After three successful weeks of racing action,<br>
    an old face made an appearance and made her presence known to more than 125<br>
    racing teams Friday night at the Farmer City Raceway.&nbsp; With only the
    four<br>
    divisional feature races remaining to be run, Mother Nature let loose on the<br>
    Central Illinois speedplant after several hours of an impressive lightning<br>
    display in the surrounding areas.<br>
    <br>
    Bob Sargent, promoter of the Track Enterprises facility, announced that next<br>
    week a full racing program will be in place with the mighty late models
    doing<br>
    double duty, running twin features.&nbsp; Despite threatening overcast skies
    and<br>
    dropping temperatures throughout the day, a good crowd was on hand to take
    in<br>
    week four's racing action.<br>
    <br>
    What they were treated to was some exciting heat race action on a very slick<br>
    race track, that often times found drivers running up front that might not<br>
    normally do so.&nbsp; Passing became a real challenge for some of the faster
    cars<br>
    towards the rear of the fields, and some found a speedy line around the rim<br>
    of the racing surface.&nbsp; Steve Hillard of Sadorus, IL, winner of week
    number<br>
    one's feature, commented that it was perhaps the slickest track he has raced<br>
    on after he captured his late model heat over Jason Fegers.&nbsp; Hillard
    tried<br>
    two unsuccessful slide jobs on Fegers, until he finally made the third<br>
    attempt stick and cruise to the win.&nbsp; Drivers had to be coy, yet
    patient, if<br>
    they hoped to get to the front.<br>
    <br>
    Matt Taylor of Springfield, IL led the way in qualifying with a lap of<br>
    14.130.&nbsp; That was good enough on this day to better a field of 36 late
    models.<br>
    <br>
    Todd Bennett found his way to victory lane in the late model Dash for Cash.<br>
    <br>
    Heat number one was won by Jammie Wilson of Hoopeston, IL over Don Hammer
    and<br>
    Brian Shirley.<br>
    <br>
    Heat number two saw Junior Shickel cruised to an uncontested win over Corey<br>
    Turner and Tom Thoennes.<br>
    <br>
    Heat race number three saw Steve Hillard slip past Jason Fegers and Kerby<br>
    Damery.<br>
    <br>
    Semi-feature wins went to Steve Sheppard Jr. of New Berlin lead Junior<br>
    Shickel and Mike Mullvain to the stripe, while Corey Turner of Collum bested<br>
    Wes Steidinger and Tom Thoennes.<br>
    <br>
    UMP modified heat race winners included Aaron Ricketts os Fairbury, Randy<br>
    Huffman of Maroa, Jerald Meier of Chenoa, and Denny Schwartz of Ashmore.&nbsp;<br>
    Todd Kirkland of Mt. Zion won the dash.<br>
    <br>
    Kyle Logue of Oreana and Shane Maple of Decatur both captured semi-feature<br>
    wins.<br>
    <br>
    In the sportsman ranks, Shane Hill of Streator won the dash, while heat race<br>
    winners included Rick Weekly of Buffalo and Darrell Dick of Mansfield.<br>
    <br>
    In street stock action, it was Steve Ewing of Decatur won won the dash,
    while<br>
    Richard Pettycourt of Monticello, Ryan Unzicker of El Paso, and Jim Quinn of<br>
    Farmer City won heat races.<br>
    <br>
    The program was halted as the street stock class was preparing to get<br>
    underway with the first of two consolation races.&nbsp; It was unclear at
    press<br>
    time when the other feature races will be made up, but next week's program<br>
    will showcase the late models running double features.<br>

                  Storms to Victory in Farmer City Thriller<br>
                  <br>
                  Farmer City, IL (April 12) - With threatening weather forecast
                  for much of the Central Illinois region Friday night, only one
                  storm would hit the Farmer City Raceway and score his first
                  late model feature win of this young 2002 season. 32-year-old
                  and second generation driver Matt Taylor of Springfield, IL
                  found a lower groove to his liking and slipped underneath
                  early race leader and polesitter Mike Mullvain of Bartonsville
                  (IL) on lap four, then withstood the challenges of
                  30-year-late model veteran Roger Long over the final 21 laps
                  to secure the win.<br>
                  <br>
                  Taylor, driving a 1994 Rayburn/Bill West Enterprises/Hixson
                  Race Engines/Monte Carlo, and starting third on the grid, was
                  surprised that the lower groove opened up so quickly and so
                  early in the race. &quot;I was really surprised (Mike)
                  Mullvain slid up off the bottom when he did, and let me get
                  by, but I was happy when he did. There was a lot of bite down
                  there, and I could see the rest of the track was starting to
                  slick off a little bit and we just jumped on it,&quot; said
                  Taylor. &quot;The chassis is old, but it's got all good parts.
                  We've just been playing with some things, and got lucky
                  tonight I guess,&quot; commented Taylor, who is the son of
                  long-time Central Illinois late model standout Dick Taylor,
                  who himself has recently found his way back behind the wheel.<br>
                  <br>
                  Meanwhile, the battle for the third spot was just as fierce as
                  the battle for the top spot, as last week's feature winner and
                  point leader Steve Hillard of Sadorus, wrestled with Richie
                  Hedrick of Urbana and El Paso's Joe Harlan. Both Hedrick and
                  Harlan would eventually fall by the way side with mechanical
                  problems by lap nine, while Hillard chased Long to the stripe
                  for third. Following that trio to the line were a pair of
                  impressive young guns in Steve Sheppard Jr. of New Berlin, and
                  Brian Shirley of Springfield. Shirley rallied from the 11th
                  starting spot. Rounding out the top ten were Mullvain, Ryan
                  Dauber, Kerby Damery, Junior Shickel, and Chris Dick. The
                  25-lap main event was slowed only twice including an opening
                  lap complete restart.<br>
                  <br>
                  Long, who had earlier scored win in both the trophy dash and
                  third heat race, felt lap traffic played a key role in aiding
                  to Taylor's win. &quot;Matt did a nice job in putting those
                  lap cars (Don Hammer and Jammie Wilson) between himself and
                  me, and got some seperation when I couldn't get by as
                  easily,&quot; Long said. In fact, it was on lap 13 that Taylor
                  was able to get that cushion he would need to hold off a
                  hard-charging Long, who finished only several car length's
                  back. Long, who finished third last week, said that it has
                  been important that he has been consistent so far despite the
                  car not being 100%. Watch out Central Illinois, if &quot;The
                  Flyin Farmer&quot; figures that out any time soon, he's going
                  to be tough to catch.<br>
                  <br>
                  In preliminary race action, Hammer, Dick, and Long scored
                  popular wins, while Long doubled up in the trophy dash. Semi
                  features were won by Dick and Wes Steidinger.<br>
                  <br>
                  In UMP open-wheeled action, Jeff Leka of Buffalo, IL picked up
                  his second consecutive feature win, as he tackled the high
                  side and moved passed early race front-runner Kyle Logue of
                  Oreana with three laps to go, then went on to capture the
                  checkered flag. Leka, who started third, chased Logue and Dave
                  Porth through out most of the event before making his move,
                  and Logue was well aware of who was where. &quot;I was
                  watching the scoreboard each time exiting turn two, and I kept
                  seeing the #25 and #3 behind me. When I seen those numbers
                  change, I knew he was coming. I only wish this race would have
                  been 15-laps instead of 20,&quot; said a smiling Logue.
                  &quot;I'm very pleased with the outcome despite not winning.
                  We finished third last week and second tonight, so that shows
                  consistency, which more often than not, lead to
                  championships,&quot; he added. Let's just hope Jeff Leka isn't
                  listening and thinking the same thing Kyle!<br>
                  <br>
                  With the rest of the field making three and sometimes
                  four-wide the norm, Lance Dehm of Chatsworth was able to make
                  a late race pass of Porth to claim the third spot, while
                  veteran Mike Chasteen, making a rare appearance, finished
                  fifth. Rounding out the top ten were Todd Kirkland, Al
                  Crawley, Wes Odell, Aaron Ricketts, and Brian Lynn.<br>
                  <br>
                  Heat races were won by Ricketts, Porth, Kirkland, and Logue.
                  Logue also doubled up in the trophy dash. Semi features won
                  won by Randy Huffman and Marty Hiser.<br>
                  <br>
                  The Sportsman feature went to another repeat winner in Eric
                  Smith of Bloomington, IL as he held off Rod Sandage, also of
                  Bloomington, and Jason Cleaver of Springfield. Rich Weekly and
                  Darrell Dick finished fourth and fifth, respectively. Rounding
                  out the top ten were Shane Hill, Kent Collins, Johnny Gibbs,
                  Chuck McNeese, and Brian Cline.<br>
                  <br>
                  Heat races went to Sandage and Cleaver, while Smith also
                  picked up the trophy dash win.<br>
                  <br>
                  Street Stock feature went to Hod Rod Bicknell of Normal (IL)
                  over Jim Palmer of White Heath (IL), and Richard Petticourt of
                  Monticello (IL). A pair of Kankakee Motor Speedway regulars
                  finished fourth and fifth respectively, in Mike Cavanaugh of
                  Bradley (IL), and Kevin Lenzen of Wilmington (IL). Rounding
                  out the top ten at the line were Steve Ewing, John Geary, Ryan
                  Unzicker, Jeff Momper, and Danny Glover. In all, five drivers
                  who call Kankakee home most Friday nights were on hand, with
                  KMS scheduled not to open until the 26th of April. Geary,
                  Momper, and Jay Hamilton were the other three visitors who
                  performed well despite the track disadvantage.<br>
                  <br>
                  Bicknell, Pettycourt, and John Farris scored heat race
                  triumphs, while Ewing mastered the trophy dash lineup. Jim
                  Quinn scored the win in the semi-feature.<br>

    (April 6) - </b>To say &quot;The Modern Day Cowboy&quot; John Gill of
    Mitchell, IN got on his horse and galloped off into the sunset, would be so
    cliche', but that's precisely what went down Saturday night at Brownstown
    Speedway, as Gill drove his Helena/Performance Plus Car Wash/Wildside Race
    Graphics/Elrod Grain/Rocket/Draime/Pontiac Grand Prix into victory lane to
    the sum of $2,000 .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    42-year-old Gill, now in his 21st year behind the wheel of a late model,
    used the outside pole position to get a good run on polesitter Jim Curry at
    the drop of the green flag and pulled ahead when the duo reached the
    back-stretch and with a few good swift kicks with the spurs, this
    &quot;Cowboy&quot; was gone! <o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Temperatures ranged from the low 40's to the low 30's
    by feature time, but that was not enough to keep the action on the track
    from heating things up for most of the large crowd in attendance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Nearly 160 cars filed into the pit area, including 41 late model
    drivers vying to be crowned Icebreaker Champion for 2002.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Last year, &quot;The Chosen One&quot; Timmy Yeager of Harrodsburg,
    Ky. took home the checkers with a hard-charging Tim Prince taking the
    runner-up spot. In the first edition of the Indiana Icebreaker, &quot;The
    Decatur Invader&quot; Shannon Babb rolled into victory lane in 1998.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>&quot;The Real Deal&quot; Don O'Neal held off 1997 Track Champion
    Dion Deason for the winin 1999. The following year, &quot;Donnie O&quot;
    doubled up in 2000 outdueling John Gill for the victory.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Gill showed from the drop of the green flag that he
    would not be denied this year, after running a similar race last year, but
    falling victim to lap traffic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Gill
    opened up an eight-car length lead over Brownstown's very own Curry by lap
    6, with Greg Johnsonof Edinburgh, IN,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>giving
    chase.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With the field
    stretching it out a bit by lap ten, it was still Gill well out in front with
    Curry, Johnson, Steve Hillard of Sadorus, IL, and &quot;The Franklin
    Flyer&quot; Steve Barnett rounding out the top five.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Gill began to get into lap traffic on lap 13, with Brad
    Neat the first of three to fall a lap down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Dan Sturgeon and Eddie Leviner would later fall victim to the surging
    Gill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>About that same time,
    Kevin Claycomb of Vincennes, IN, and a perennial Brownstown favorite, slid
    off the rim along the frontstretch allowing Mike Jewell of Scottsburg, IN to
    move up to the 6th spot from his 12th starting position.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span>Hillard and Johnson waged their own little battle for the third spot,
    though Johnson would not bend.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">With chief starter Rusty Nunn signalling to the field
    the crossed flags, indicating the half way point, it was still Gill, Curry,
    Johnson, Hillard, and Jewell now making up the top five, with Barnett, Erb
    Jr., Doug Ault, Claycomb, and 2001 Brownstown Speedway track champion Mark
    Barber rounding out the top ten.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Only one caution flag was thrown to the field during
    the race, and it appeared on lap 23, when Osgood, IN<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Shawn Negangard sat spun in turn four.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This allowed the field to gather up behind the elusive Gill,
    who would get some breathing room in the form of lap cars Eddie Leviner of
    Merrillville, IN and Brad Neat, who seperated Gill from Curry on the ensuing
    restart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This seperation was
    all that Gill would need as he set sail with a clear track in front of him
    for much of the remainder of the race.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Five circuits later on lap 28, Dan Sturgeon pulled off
    into the infield with mechanical woes without incident, thus no caution was
    needed.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Gill was looking to close the deal on a race that had
    dealt him a bad hand once before when lap traffic became an issue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>In the 2001edition of the Indiana Icebreaker, Gill had opened up a
    huge lead, but had got tangled with lap cars late in the race and was
    sidelined with mechanical failure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">With 10 to go, it was Gill, Curry, Johnson, Jewell, and
    Barnett.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Erb Jr., Hillard, Claycomb, Ault, and Barber rounding out the
    top ten.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">On lap 37, Jewell slipped underneath Johnson for the
    third spot and set his sights next on Curry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span><o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">One lap later, Jewell made a move on the outside,
    passing Curry as the two went down the back straight, thus claiming the
    runner-up spot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But time would
    not be on his side, as Jewell would trail Gill to the stripe, followed by
    Curry, Johnson, and Barnett.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Erb
    Jr., Hillard, Ault, Claycomb, and Barber rounding out the top ten.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>&quot;We were running really good there at the end, and we could when
    we got some heat in the tires.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    think if we would have had five more laps or so we'd have caught John,&quot;
    said Jewell.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&quot;The track was real good.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It was pretty racy,&quot; said Gill in his post-race
    comments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;We got to
    pushing at one end of the track and were loose at the other end.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I had tried adjusting the front brakes, then went to
    three-wheel brakes just to try to keep the nose down, and keep the car from
    wanting to come around.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;The
    track was pretty slick there at the start there, and towards the middle it
    started to take some rubber.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
    just had to readjust to that and right there at the end I was just trying to
    drive a straight line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I just
    didn't want to mess up, with that rubber it's kinda you either give it all
    or nothing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We were sure
    looking forward to winning one, and we're just glad to able to get back in
    the winner's circle,&quot; said a happy and relieved Gill.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">In preliminary heat race action, Curry took heat number
    one over Johnson, Barber, and Leviner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>This may have been the most action packed heat race most have ever
    seen in the Icebreaker's five year history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>A watchful Steve Hillard commented, &quot;you would have thought they
    were out there racing for $10,000, not $2,000&quot;.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Gill claimed the second heat race in a runaway over
    Jesse James Lay, Erb Jr., and Bryan Barber.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The third heat race was won by Doug Ault, as he
    bettered Barnett, Brad Barrow, and Doug McCammon to the stripe.<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
    </o:p>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The fourth and final heat race was all Steve Hillard,
    as he walked away from Claycomb, Jewell, and last year's Icebreaker runner-upTim
    Prince.<o:p>

    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>

    </span>One week ago in Florence, KY, amongst some of the top drivers in the

    <br>
    By Paul D. Bayne<br>
    <br>
    Farmer City, Ill. April 5, 2002 - Steve Hillard of Sadorus, IL picked up<br>
    right where he left off a week ago in Florence, KY, as he led all 25 laps en<br>
    route to capturing the season opener at the frigid Farmer City Raceway
    Friday<br>
    night.&nbsp; A good turnout of both fans and drivers were on hand despite<br>
    temperatures that had dropped into the upper 20's by feature time.&nbsp;
    Hillard,<br>
    who had charged from 25th to 5th last week in the Northern All Stars opener<br>
    at Florence Speedway before being sidelined with a cut left rear tire,
    looked<br>
    to change his luck on this night.&nbsp; After an opening lap restart that
    saw both<br>
    Dennis Erb Jr. and Joe Harlan skate out in front,&nbsp; Hillard starting
    from the<br>
    pole, charged out front right from the drop of the green flag over<br>
    Carpentersville's (IL) Erb Jr. and El Paso's (IL) Harlan.&nbsp; While these
    same<br>
    three battled for most of the race, Fithian's (IL) Roger Long and Matt
    Taylor<br>
    of Springfield, IL were busy sorting out the fourth and fifth spots<br>
    respectively.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;The Flyin Farmer&quot; Long, was making his return to late model
    racing after<br>
    suffering injuries in a automobile accident late last season.&nbsp; &quot;I
    feel pretty<br>
    good though I'm still not 100%&quot;,&nbsp; Long said.&nbsp; &quot;My arm
    still hasn't recovered<br>
    entirely, but I don't think it's going to hinder me either.&nbsp; I think
    I'll be<br>
    just fine.&nbsp; I'm just getting comfortable back in the car again&quot;,
    he added.<br>
    <br>
    Hillard had stretched out to an eight-car length lead by lap two and left<br>
    little doubt who would master this frigid fleet on this night. On lap four,<br>
    the caution was brought out for the cars of Justin Allgaier and Cory<br>
    Daugherty, who had come together in turn one.&nbsp; Both drivers were done
    for the<br>
    night.&nbsp; Three laps later another yellow flag flew when Kerby Damery has<br>
    slowed in turn four.&nbsp; At the same time Dave Smith had pulled off into
    the<br>
    infield and both were retired for the night.&nbsp; Eric Kwasigroh also took
    his<br>
    car behind pit wall after the race had resumed.<br>
    <br>
    Back up front, Taylor was able to slip underneath Long for the fourth spot
    on<br>
    lap 11, while Bartonsville's (IL) Mike Mullvain was looking to crack the top<br>
    five as well.&nbsp; Long would have none of it however, as he used the
    high-groove<br>
    to move by both Taylor and Harlan to claim third.&nbsp; Harlan also moved
    back<br>
    around Taylor to reclaim the fourth spot, with Taylor falling back to fifth.&nbsp;<br>
    On lap 17, Taylor was able to get back past Harlan for fourth and the top<br>
    five would remain intact the remainder of the 25-lapper.<br>
    <br>
    While top five positions were settled , 19-year-old Wes Steidinger of<br>
    Fairbury, IL was having a good run of his own.&nbsp; In only his seventh
    start in<br>
    a late model, Steidinger was making his first A main start after weeks of<br>
    disappointment.&nbsp; Albeit, Steidinger has been traveling around the
    country<br>
    competing against many of the very best in the late model ranks trying to
    get<br>
    the necessary seat time required to be a front-runner.&nbsp;&nbsp; Making
    the jump to<br>
    the late model division after a very successful three-year UMP modified<br>
    stint. &quot;The Fairbury Flyer&quot;, who started 19th on the grid, had
    moved his way<br>
    up to challenge for the seventh position with Cody Hupp before the two of<br>
    them would get together entering turn one on lap 19, resulting in a broken<br>
    tie rod, a bent rim, and a trip on the hook back to the pits for Steidinger.&nbsp;<br>
    He would be credited with 13th place in the final rundown.<br>
    <br>
    Over the final six laps, no one was able to make any sort of move for<br>
    position and when they crossed the stripe for the final time it was Hillard,<br>
    Erb, Long, Taylor, and Harlan leading the way, followed by Mullvain, Brian<br>
    Shirley, Junior Shickel, Jason Feger, and Ryan Dauber rounding out the top<br>
    ten.&nbsp; The race was slowed by six cautions, with only 12 of 20 cars
    would<br>
    finish.&nbsp; Unofficially, 27 late models were on hand despite the cold
    weather.&nbsp;<br>
    Urbana's (IL) Richie Hedrick blew a motor during hotlaps and was unable to<br>
    participate.<br>
    <br>
    Long, who is celebrating his 30th year in late model racing was quick to<br>
    offer advice to young Donny Walden, who was making his debut in the late<br>
    model ranks after moving up from the Mini-Sprints a year ago.&nbsp; In fact,
    Long<br>
    pointed out that there were several drivers making their late model debuts<br>
    and that late model racing was in good hands in the coming future.&nbsp;
    Guys like<br>
    Walden, Steidinger, Jason Fegers, Chris Dick just to name a few, were all&nbsp;<br>
    making their late model debuts at Farmer City.&nbsp; While Walden was
    battling<br>
    both nervousness and anxiousness, Long pointed out that it will simply just<br>
    take some time and that Walden was doing just fine.&nbsp; Dennis Erb Jr.
    wasn't<br>
    too pleased however, as the two of them got together in hot laps, and while<br>
    Walden wanted to go over and offer apologies to the veteran Erb, he thought<br>
    some things are left better alone.&nbsp; As it turned out, Erb was none the
    worse<br>
    for wear, recording a solid second-place finish, while Walden wrestled his<br>
    car throughout his heat race.&nbsp; Walden, driving a former Billy Drake
    driven<br>
    MastersBilt chassis said that he received a lot of advice from Drake about<br>
    the car and what to expect.&nbsp; It appears at least this young man knows
    where<br>
    to go ask for help when the time comes, and before long we may well be<br>
    talking about him at the top of the heap.<br>
    <br>
    Hillard was fast qualifier with a 12.715 second effort.&nbsp; Taylor won the
    Dash<br>
    for Cash and heat race winners included Bret Sievert, Junior Shickel, and<br>
    Taylor.&nbsp; Steve Sheppard Jr. would claim the semi win.<br>
    <br>
    In UMP modified action, it was all Jeff Leka.&nbsp; Leka of Buffalo, IL,&nbsp;
    left<br>
    little doubt who would be in command of this race, as he thread his way past<br>
    several cars to takeover the top spot but perhaps even more impressive was<br>
    Dan Hamstra of Fair Oaks, IN.&nbsp; Hamstra would have to come from the semi
    after<br>
    spinning in his heat race while running second to Brian Lynn of Mason City,<br>
    IL.&nbsp; Hamstra started 17th on the grid and charged his way up to second
    with<br>
    several laps to go, but ran out of time to make any sort of significant run<br>
    on Leka.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Kyle Logue of Oreana, IL, showed some muscle early on, but would settle in<br>
    behind Hamstra for third, while early race leader Mark Anderson faded to<br>
    fourth late in the race.&nbsp; Lynn would round out the top five.&nbsp; RJ
    Gall, Lance<br>
    Dehm, Aaron Ricketts, Todd Kirkland, and Tony Roland would finish sixth<br>
    through tenth respectively.<br>
    <br>
    The cold temperatures made it difficult for some to gain traction late in
    the<br>
    race, as more than a few drivers were getting loose entering turn three.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Kirkland would prove victorious in the Dash and heat number two, while Leka,<br>
    Lynn, and Roland claimed heat races.&nbsp; Hamstra and Dehm would also take<br>
    checkers in the two semi's to make the A main field.<br>
    <br>
    In sportsmen action, Eric Smith of Bloomington, IL, would move around early<br>
    race leader Jason Cleaver and go on for the win, but not without heavy<br>
    pressure from Bill Wilhour over the last half-dozen laps or so.&nbsp; In
    fact,<br>
    Smith wasn't even aware that Wilhour was that close and was actually an
    error<br>
    away from over-taking Smith for the lead.&nbsp; Cleaver would settle for the
    third<br>
    spot, while Rich Weekly, and Kent Collins rounded out the top five.<br>
    <br>
    Rod Sandage of Bloomington, would fall victim to a cut left rear tire on the<br>
    opening lap, but was able to visit victory lane in the first heat, while<br>
    Smith would claim the second heat.<br>
    <br>
    Richard Pettycoat of Monticello, IL, won the street stock feature over Jim<br>
    Palmer, Ryan Unzicker, John Geary, and Steve Ewing.&nbsp; Jason Unzicker,
    Shane<br>
    Maple, Allen Crowder, Gary Lewis, and Greg Brewer rounded out the top ten.<br>
    <br>
    Jay Smithson won the Dash, while Mike Cavanaugh, Palmer, and Billy Nail won<br>
    preliminary heat races.<br>
    <br>
    Racing action will resume next Friday with a full schedule of UMP Late<br>

    <p>KANKAKEE, IL</font><i> <font size="2">(March 29, 2002) Kankakee Motor
    Speedway is gearing up for another action packed season of racing
    excitement, with the season opening event now less than four weeks away. Two
    practice dates have been set, weather permitting, for Sunday, April 7th, and
    Sunday, April 21st, from 1pm until 5pm. The opening points night is set for
    April 26th, and will be highlighted by a $2,000-to-win late model special,
    as well as events for the always entertaining UMP open-wheel modifieds and
    the street stocks.</p>
    <p>Kankakee Motor Speedway begins its third season under management by
    the O Connor family. Long time Illinois dirt track standout Jim O
    Connor heads the group along with sons Jarrod, Reece, Mark, and Jim Jr., as
    well as, daughters Chris and Jill. Among noticebale changes made to the
    track for this year was the widening of turn one to allow for a smoother
    transition to the backstretch and to make it racier for the drivers.</p>
    <p>Among this year's schedule of events will be a visit by the United Dirt
    Track Racing Association (UDTRA) on May 13th, considered by most
    knowledgeable racing enthusiasts to be the premier dirt late model touring
    series in America. UDTRA president Mike Swims made an official visit to
    Kankakee last season and was looking to add some dates to an already
    impressive schedule. &quot;We were approached about hosting a UDTRA event
    last year, and after some considerable thought we welcomed the opportunity
    to host these elite drivers here at Kankakee,&quot; said Jarrod O'Connor.
    &quot;It was actually an easy decision to make, and considering what
    tremendous fans we have here at Kankakee, we felt it was a win-win
    situation.&quot; True, Kankakee has long had impressive and enthusiastic
    race fans, and one can be sure, you better plan an early arrival the night
    of May 13th if you hope to find a seat. Rain date for the event is scheduled
    for Tuesday, May 14th. No word as of yet, to whether or not tickets for this
    event will be sold in advance. Most drivers including 2002 UDTRA series
    champion Rick Eckert of York, PA, will be making their first-ever visit to
    the land of Kankakee. Others expected to be on hand include Scott Bloomquist,
    Freddy Smith, Billy Moyer, Shannon Babb, Steve Francis, Wendell Wallace,
    Dale McDowell, John Anderson, Joey Izzo, along with Midwest hotshots Bob
    Pierce, Kevin Weaver, Bob Pohlman, and Don O'Neal. For further information
    regarding the UDTRA, visit www.udtra.com</p>
    <p>Others events sure to pack the grandstands and pit area are the
    $10,000-to-win UMP Summernationals stop on Wednesday, June 26th. With the
    recently announced addition of $100,000 being awarded to the UMP
    Summernationals series champion, it is a sure bet that many of the top late
    model drivers across the nation will be on hand for this event. Also, a
    special $1,500-to-win UMP modified special is slated for Friday, July 19th.</p>
    <p>The $15,000-to-win Kevin Roderick Memorial received national acclaim in
    2001, and was considered by most who witnessed this event, to be among the
    greatest races ever seen at Kankakee. One can expect to see many of the same
    top late model drivers do battle on the 1/3-mile speedplant, Friday, August
    30th. Last year, Don O'Neal of Martinsville, IN reclaimed the top spot on
    lap 45 and held on over the final 30 laps to claim the $15,000 top prize.
    Bob Pierce of Oakwood, IL and Brian Birkhofer of Muscatine, IA finished
    second and third, respectively.</p>
    <p>Defending track champions Corey Turner (late models), R.J. Gall (UMP
    modifieds), and Billy Wicker (street&nbsp;stocks)&nbsp;are set to return
    this year to defend their respective track titles.&nbsp; Kankakee typically
    plays host to some of the strongest fields of UMP modifieds any race fan
    could hope to find on&nbsp;a given night, and the street stocks put on a
    whale of a show as well.</p>
    <p>Returning again this year after rave reviews last year will be the
    special two-seat racecar built by the Warrior Chassis shops in Knoxville,
    Tenn. The car is scheduled to be ready for opening night with Jim O
    Connor behind the wheel. Two times this year however, one lucky fan, will
    experience the thrill of actually being in the car during live race events.
    That means qualifying, heat races, and mains for the entire night. Tickets
    will be sold for $10 in advance, with winners being selected the night of
    Friday, May 31st, and Friday August 30th, to have the chance to win this
    opportunity. The car is slated to race on Friday, June 14th, and again on
    September 20th, the season finale. The car will also perform during
    intermission and after the nights racing program has been completed. Some
    rides will be given away as prizes throughout the season, but others will
    cost a fair $40 for five laps, and $60 for eight laps.</p>
    <p>KMS is located just off I-57 at exit 308, then 1 mile south on US 45
    (Schuyler Ave.), then 0.3 miles west to the fairgrounds. Gates open at 5pm,
    time trials at 7pm, and racing at 8pm. Overnight camping is available at a
    nominal fee of $10 per day for those wishing to stay the night. For more
    information call race day phone at (815) 929-9105.</p>
