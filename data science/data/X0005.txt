boomerang Herb Smith used to set his Guiness Book World Record throw of
108 yards (98 m) at the Littlehampton Sports Field in Sussex, United Kingdom,
on 17th June 1972. The boomerang was heavily weighted with lead inserted
into both wingtips. There is another small weight on the elbow "to give
the boomerang a lower flight trajectory and allow it to return on a more
horizontal plane". Dont insert the elbow weight into the material, it substantially
weakens the boomerang, rather use adhesive tape. You may use Herbs airfoil
(see high-resolution plan), which has bevels, or our proposed airfoil,
which has an undercut. The World Record Gem had a massive weight of 240
g and required a monster arm for throwing. Accounts of people having seen
Herb throwing report that his throw was very powerful indeed. Looking back
it seems like a miracle to be able to throw a boomerang of THAT shape 100
m out and back ! It is only accomplished with brute force and a good wind.
In the late 70s and 80s, Herb designed a plethora of more sophisticated
LD boomerangs, treasures and precious collectables today, for example the
famous <a href="#sh">Sussex Hook</a>, <a href="#s1">Marathon, Tigarang</a>,

of Australia was one of the main figures of LD in the 1970s and early 1980s.
He broke the World Record several times during that period. The rules were
somewhat different from what we have today, though. The distance was measured
only on a straight line perpendicular to the throwing base line. So even
if the boomerang went out further more to the right or left of that line,
this extra distance was not accounted for. One of Bob's throws, measured
at 111m with that method, was reported to go out "at least 120m" maximum
distance slighlty off&nbsp; the perpendicular line. The plan is based on
a boomerang Tibor got from Bob in 1998. It was probably built in the 1980s.
It is heavy and thick, and the airfoil is VERY blunt on the wing tips.
Sophisticated low lift / low drag airfoil design was only introduced later,
among others by Volker Behrens. It is therefore only with brute force that
you can get this boomerang to fly 120m out and back !&nbsp;</font></font></td>

World Record boomerang. Al Gerhard attained a distance of 112 m in 1979
with this type of boomerang, a heavily weighted strip laminated hook. As
the wooden strips are aligned with the shape of the boomerang, it is strong
and more resistant to breaking than simple plywood, especially with the
heavy weights embedded within the wingtips. Furthermore, to layers of strips with 4mm thickness are laminated together in "double offset" fashion to increase strength. At that time, paxolin and epoxy
resin based materials were not used yet very commonly in the boomerang
scene, probably because they were difficult to obtain as sheet material
and one had to mix and harden the resin oneself. Al Gerhards was very tall
and, apparently, he had a very powerful throw, which is necessary for this
kind of boom. The material thickness if 7 mm, so there is a consideralbe
airfoil drag, which has to be counteracted by the inital velocity of the
boomerang, in order to make it return to the thrower after travelling for
over 200 m.&nbsp;</font></font></td>

Record of 238 m was set with this boomerang by Manuel Sch&uuml;tz (Kloten
1999). It is obviously derived from the <a href="#s7">MegaQuirl</a> and
the <a href="#pthf">Pathfinder II</a>. Manuel says 150 m can be attained
without the lead in the leading wing. In good conditions, he throws over
200 m. As you may know, the NASA Voyager (I and II) <a href="http://vraptor.jpl.nasa.gov/">space
probes</a>, launched in 1977, are the most distant man-made objects. They
are currently approaching the boundary of the solar system.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">Manuel gave the
details about how the airfoil needs to be carved. Download the full-size
plan using the link for a detailed version, including airfoil crossections.
As usual with Manu's booms, everything is perfectly rounded and smooth.
The rough carving is carried out with a file, then sand paper is used from
40 to 1000 grain size. Manuel always works "wet" to absorb the dust. The
airfoil is generally very sharp to minimize drag.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">In a newer version
of the airfoil, the trailing edges are carved concave, from the middle
of the wing to its tip, the elbow region is not altered (The older version
is shown shaded). This seems to bring about a significant reduction in
drag, as we've noticed that the average velocity of the rang is much higher,
especially in the last phase of the flight. Manu assumes that this airfoil
reduces the wake (turbulence behind the airfoil) and thus the drag.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">Tuning: a small
positive dihedral on the leading wing (0.5-1 mm), possibly a small negative
angle of attack (B WARE: the boom is very sensitive here - too much and
you'll have a kylie.)</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">Throwing: wind angle
20 &deg;, elevation 0-5 &deg;, tilt angle 80 &deg;, maximum spin and maximum
throwing power !!! Hey, these are Manuel's hints ! If you know his throwing
power, you can imagine what that means to "ordinary" people. At least I
(Lorenz) am not able to throw the booms that Manu has adjusted to his throw;
they tend to crash on their way back. By giving rotation, you stabilize
the boom. In fact, Manuel usually throws 20 to 30 m farther with my rangs

original plan Manuel drew of his record breaking boomerang of 1998. It
is obviously a <a href="#s7">MegaQuirl</a> modification. It was designed
around the period when a lander named Pathfinder was deployed on the surface
of Mars by the NASA. The name actually reflects Manuel's effort in LD quite
accurately. He noticed relatively early (1997) that Challenger sized booms
were not ideal for throwing LD. The MegaQuirl had been around for some
time, but nobody had Manuel's insight (and skill) and most people felt
that a "real" LD boomerang must be Challenger sized. At one of Manuel's
early LD tournaments (Troyes 1997) he broke the Swiss record (120.72m at
that time) with a throw over 124.2 m with a MegaQuirl shape (pax 3mm).
It did last only a few minutes, though, as I (Lorenz) threw 132.2 m with
a Challenger III (GFEC 4mm !) a little later. This, however, was the last
time I beat Manuel... Anyway, the Pathfinder was a milestone on Manuel's
path to designing the most advanced LD shape we know, the <a href="#voy">Voyager

as a LongDistance postcard-size boomerang!! The shape has inwardly swept
wing tips in order to fit the size of a postcard. Axel reported a measured
distance (one spotter) of 70-80 m. Awesome for a boomerang that small !
Apparently, he also spent hours searching for the little boom in twilight.
There was a diameter 10 mm lead weight on the leading arm. There are strong
bevels on both wings, which is unusual for an LD boom, the one on the trailing
arm being more pronounced.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">A few years later,
an article by Axel Heckner was published in the German "Info", No. 37,
March 1992, where he reports experiments with a large Makro (32.5 cm span).
He stated that the inwardly swept wings of the Markro, originally introduced
to fit the postcard size, actually represent an important feature for an
LD boomerang: they have a low "effectivity" (term coined by Axel), which
means they do not point towards the center of gravity. This results in
a higher effective chord length, concomitant with a lower lift. Part of
this theory was later implemented in his MegaQuirl design for the trailing
wing. The leading wing of the MegaQuirl, however, is rather effective.
Axel also confirms that making the trailing wing narrower that the leading
wing, as seen for instance in the Challenger, gives better returning properties.
It seems that the full size Makro has strong bevels as well. We do not
think this is a good feature, so we have our own airfoil suggestion for
wood and paxolin (see high-resolution plan).</font></font></td>

wonder what this boomerang's name means. "LDPR" simply stands for "Long
Distance Paxolin Rang". According to Gerhard, the design is derived from
the Herb Smith model "Black Prince". The LDPR is V-shaped with a small
elbow region and therefore cannot go out extremely far. Moreover, you can
expect that this elbow design will cause rather high wind drag. You need
quite a strong arm, and a little wind, to get it to fly over 100m and all
the way back. The trailing arm has distinctive LD characteristics, i.e.
it is narrower than the leading wing and swept inwards, reducing thereby
the effective lift. The leading arm does not have the "hook" feature, the
forward swept wing tip. This wil theoretically give a wing with less lift
and a small layover rate, the same features the <a href="#mkr">Makro</a>
exhibits.&nbsp;</font></font></td>

was probably the second most important LD thrower in Britain after Herb
Smith. He held the national record over 103.5 m (set in Sedan, F, 1993)
for 8 years. We are not sure if this is the record breaking boom, though.
The plan was published in the German "Bumerang Welt" magazine, issue IV/90.
The name of the boom is not clear, the plan was just titled "Long Distance".
It is possible that the shape is a variation of one of Herb Smith's designs,
at least it looks very similar to one of them. The original material is
3mm paxolin, but we think 4mm pax or 3mm GFEC might work better (certainly
it will be less prone to breaking). The full weighting is two holes of
12mm diameter on the leading wing filled with lead. Beginners are advised
to use less weight. The airfoil is the same for both wings, so the plan
only shows the crossections on one. It is not very aggressive, rather blunt
leading edges and small undercuts. Actually, in the description of the
plan it says that the boomerang has to be thrown DOWNwards, which is a
clear indication of excesive lift.</font></font></td>

works better in low wind conditions, while the upper shape works fine in
nice winds. (Please if you are interested in purchasing one of Schummys

I made copy in 4mm paxolin. It works well, but won't go all the wayout.
However, I then decided to build an enlarged (119%) version and made it
of 4mm pax. Works fine. The choice of material should definitly be a very
rigid thin (2.5mm would be best I guess) composite. G10 gets warped quite
fast after a few crashes. G11, a higher quality GFEC, should do the job.</font></font>

and that the undercut is very pronounced, more than half the material thickness
at some points.&nbsp;</font></font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">[1997] This is the
GFEC boomerang in the B AGRESSiVE collection. A 'Far' should not miss in
your collection if you take LD seriously :-) Now let's be serious. The
advantange of this boomerang over the paxolin clubs 'BAg Hook II' and'Beatback'
is its small weight and easy-to-throw characteristics, while distances
of over 100m are still possible.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">You may build the
'Far' in Paxolin 4mm if you xerox the original plan to 117%. With accurate
weighting you will get a first class competition boomerang with a range
of over 110m in a light breeze. When we first saw the 'Challenger III'
we thought it was the best LongDistance Boomerang available. A couple of
months later we got to know the 'FullPower'. We believed that it had a
better flight performance than the 'Challenger III'. So this began to be
our favourite LD boom. Much later, Tibor had the idea of building his 'Far'
in Paxolin 4mm. He therefore xeroxed his original'Far'-plan to 117%. On
the field we saw a boomerang with an excellent flightbehaviour. Since then,
we believe that the 'Far' is the best boomerang for throwing accurately
beyond 100m.&nbsp;</font></font>

plan, you will get additional information about how to carve the airfoil.
The design is dated Oct 95. I named the original shape "BAg Hook", but
because the shape had slightly changed after a few iterations, I gave it
a new name: "Beatback". Tibor named the hook he designed just after I had
my first version "BAg Hook II". The Beatback is a large, "Challenger size"
LD boom that might be difficult to handle for beginners. With aggressive
airfoil carving (and lead weight on the leading wing) you can X-tend the
range&nbsp; to over 120m.</font></font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">[1998] This design
(July 98) is a combination of the MegaQuirl and the Straight Shooter. I
built it in 3.2 mm GFEC with rather conventional LD-airfoiling (for details
download the plan). The boom needs negative angle of attack and positive
dihedral on the dingle wing, otherwise it will just fly way out on a large
circle and won't rise. The distance is not extraordinary, but you can experiment
with the new generation airfoil of the <a href="#s7a">Buzz Whip</a>. I
filled a 14 mm hole on the leading arm with lead, so the boom has a weight
of 75 to 80 g. It must be thrown with 60 &deg; layover and upward because
it tends to "dive" on its way out. Use full rotation for maximum stability
and full power to prevent crashing on the way back.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">We suggest trying
2.5 mm GFEC as well (which we didn't try yet). Performance might be improved
due to a reduction of drag. A problem might be the insufficient stiffness
and tendency to getting warped if you use thin GFEC, especially if the
quality is inferior.</font></font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">[1998] This shape
is only slightly different from the Offspring. I swept the trailing arm
more in forward direction, which reduces the "efficiency" of the wing,
concomitant with a reduction of lift. The elbow and leading wing are identical
to the Offspring in terms of shape. However, there is a more aggressive
airfoil. The onset of the carving is so smooth that I could not draw helping
lines. The wings are carved nearly symmetrical and the elbow is built for
minimum drag. There was not much tuning necessary to obtain good flight
behaviour, maybe a slight negative angle of attack on the trailing wing.
Distance is 110 to 120 m, with negative angle of attack on the leading
wing 130 m or more can be attained. Throw is 60&deg; tilt angle and slightly
upward. Especially if you have negative aoa on the leading wing you have
to use maximum throwing power and rotation for stability.</font></font>
