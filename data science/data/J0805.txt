<center>
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Introduction</font></h2></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Road rallying is possibly the most popular
form of MSA governed <a href="uk.html">motor sport in the UK</a> and certainly
one of the cheapest. (This version of <a href="rallying.html">rallying</a>
is fairly unique to the UK and in the US the flavour is <a href="http://www.goss.com/rally.html">somewhat
different</a>.)</font>
<center>
<p>
<hr><a NAME="basic"></a></center>

<center>
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Basic Principle</font></h2></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The idea behind road rallying is to follow
a precise route over taxing roads (which are sometimes unsurfaced) at a
time schedule of not more than 30 m.p.h. <i>average</i>. The route is broken
up into a <a href="http://www.ukmotorsport.com/hartmc/rr_lesson_1.html">series
of sections</a> which are interspersed with <a href="http://www.ukmotorsport.com/hartmc/rr_lesson_2.html">controls
of various sorts</a>.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is distinct from a <a href="fmsc/scatters.html">`Navigational
Scatter'</a> or Night Trial which has no defined route but a graded list
of locations to visit scattered over the map.</font>
<center>
<p>
<hr></center>

<center>
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Treasure Hunts etc.</font></h2></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Road rallying has <i>nothing</i> to do with
`Treasure Hunts' which in turn, have little to do with motor sport (except
maybe for map reading practise). Many treasure hunts are organised without
the proper authorisation of the <a href="uk_govern.html">MSA</a> and cause
more disturbance to householders than any properly organised rally would.</font>
<center>
<p>
<hr><a NAME="public"></a></center>

<center>
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Public Relations Requirements</font></h2></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Road rallies take place in the hours of darkness,
usually on Saturday nights (except for <a href="#12car">12-car events</a>)
when driving down narrow, country lanes is least dangerous (and most enjoyable).
Hopefully, most normal people would have gone to bed and the lanes will
be free of `joe public'.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All cars will be scrutineered before being
allowed to start and this includes a sound or "environmental" check. Inspite
of this, it is likely that 40+ cars travelling in the same direction (maybe)
down a twisty, narrow lane at a brisk pace(!) will wake one or two people
up. For this reason (and others) the rally organisers have to undertake
`Public Relations (PR) work' along the entire route. Each household is
visited and informed of the rally and the organisers contact details given
in case a problem arises. Persons who have provided <i>valid </i>reasons
might be avoided and that location may be referred to as a `PR problem'
or even as a `blackspot'.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">An <a href="uk_govern.html">MSA</a> official
known as a <a href="acsmc/rlos.html">Route Liason Officer</a> or `RLO'
is in possesion of an updated list of such PR information and, has to be
satisfied adequate PR work has been undertaken before route authorisation
can be granted.</font>
<center>
<p>
<hr><a NAME="route"></a></center>

<center>
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Route Definition</font></h2></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The <a href="misc/os_rally.html">maps</a>
used are the <a href="http://www.ordsvy.gov.uk/">Ordnance Survey</a> Landranger
1:50,000 (second series) which are superbly produced and contain a large
amount of detail.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The route is given out during the course
of the rally at various manned time controls in some coded form. This is
usually done in one of three ways. The most common is the `periodic handout'
whereby a bit of paper with a route description is handed out at the beginning
of the section. The second type is to use the `sealed envelope' system.
This is used to safeguard against missing marshals in that the navigator
has all the hadouts in individual sealed envelopes which are opened one
at a time at the relevant control. The third type is very much less common
and is called the `road book' system. The road book contains all the handouts
(and more usually) in a random order in one book and at each control a
code letter validates the page in the road book to be used. The main drawback
of this system is that the better navigators can plot ahead by working
out which handouts work and which don't. The way around this is to include
more than one handout which works from a given start point.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All these styles of handout full under
the umbrella of what is termed `plot and bash' style navigation. Essentially
this means this navigation has to be plotted on the move rather than in
the (good?) old days of `pre-plot' navigation. In any case, the navigator
has to decipher the handout and turn it into a real route and endevour
to get the driver to follow this route in the time allowed without penalties.</font>
<center>
<p>
<hr><a NAME="timing"></a></center>

<center>
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Timing Element</font></h2></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The timing for road rallies is nowadays linked
to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a> or Telecom time. Watches will
be synchronised with an acceptable time standard as above. (The old days
(I wish!) of road rallying used a concept know as Targa timing invented
by John Brown of <a href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~oumdc/">Oxford University
Motor Driver's Club</a>. This is now outlawed on road rallies but led to
the notion of a target time which could be set at any average speed the
organisers chose.)</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The time allowed is calculated inorder
to complete the section at 30 m.p.h. A two mile section will thus allow
four minutes to complete it without penalty. There are heavy penalties
for completing the section in less time and hence there is positive discouragement
of `racing'. However, the `time allowed' starts from when the navigator
is handed the route card and thus includes the time taken to plot the route.
For example, on a two mile section, four minutes will be allowed to `clean'
the section. If it takes two minutes to plot the route then the <i>average</i>
speed required to `clean' the section rises to 60 m.p.h.! Hence the fun
element! The top expert navigators are able to `plot on the move' in many
cases and reduce the speed requirement from the driver.</font>
<center>
<p>
<hr><a NAME="12car"></a></center>

<center>
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The 12-car Navigational Exercise</font></h2></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">An ideal way to get the flavour of road rallying
is to try a 12-car navigational exercise. This is a mini road rally with
a small entry fee and no competition license required. You will however,
need to be a member of an official <a href="uk_govern.html">MSA</a> <a href="uk_clubs.html">motor
club</a> (see below).</font>
<center>
<p>
<hr><a NAME="insur"></a></center>

<center>
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Insurance</font></h2></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">To be fully legal on a road rally, the driver
needs to be insured against any third party claims. Most conventional insurance
policies <i>do not</i> give cover for a rally of any kind (except scatters).
There are a few notable exceptions including CSMA Frizells, CIS. The usual
method most drivers use is to use the RDS (Rally Drivers Scheme) operated
by C. T. Bowrings Ltd. An application needs to be made by the organising
club at least two weeks in advance of the event for an NES acceptance letter
to allow competitors to sign-on with the RDS scheme on an event.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To use this the driver must ask the organising
club to apply for an `NES acceptance letter' on the drivers behalf. This
is completed by the driver, returned to the organising club who validate
the request and then send it on to Bowrings. A couple of weeks later (usually)
Bowrings will send out the NES letter to the driver who can then produce
it at each event which requires it. This is usually any rally using the
public highway which includes 12-cars at the organisers discretion. The
NES letter is free but there is a premium for each subsequent use. The
current scale is:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Navigational Road Rallies (with no* standard
sections timed to the second): &pound;7.50</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Road Rallies (with standard sections timed
to the minute): &pound;12.??</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Road Rallies (with standard sections timed
to the second): &pound;15.??</font></li>
</ul>

<dt>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">*It is permitted to have one regularity section
timed to the second for the purposes of <i>tie-deciding only</i>.</font></dt>

<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Recently, <a href="http://www.alexanderforbes.co.uk/">Alexander
Forbes</a> have been nominated as the MSA's insurers for motorsport. They
will cover road events at the same rates as Bowrings but without the need
for a NES acceptance letter. The driver will have to sign an indemnity
that he/she is fit to drive.</font>
