			I joined vbug in November 1994, the month I started using VB3.
			<br>
			<br>
			I attend where possible the annual conferences and regional meetings. These events are, for me, the biggest reason for my membership. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Initially I learnt not only how to use the Visual Basic environment beyond the help file and "Teach Yourself..." level, but also the where experienced programmers were having problems and how they were overcome. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I am now very literate on VB5, VBA, API etc, and find I use the events increasingly as an introduction to new technologies as well as a general hints and tips forum. 
			<br>
			<br>
			If all your hints and tips come from http://msdn.microsoft.com then you should come and see the difference in being able to ask a real person a real question and get a discussion.  
			<br>
			<br>
			Other features are The freebie evaluation material occasionally distributed at events has been very helpful.  The Monthly Visual Basic Developer magazine is a good, sometimes great, source of info. The evolving web site is proving increasingly interesting 
			<br>
			<br>
			No complaints here!

				The reasons I belong to VBUG can be summed up as follows: 
				<br>
				<br>
				* The feel-good factor of belonging to a bunch of like-minded professionals, thus providing a collective voice in the VB software world. 
				<br>
				<br>
				* The ability to get expert help and advice as and when queries or problems arise. 
				<br>
				<br>
				* Attending Local Support Group meetings where discussions, advice and expert presentations are provided. 
				<br>
				<br>
				* A choice of good quality technical magazine. 
				<br>
				<br>
				* Book and magazine discounts. 
				<br>
				<br>
				* Access to a web site where there is a whole host of useful information about new products and events. 
				<br>
				<br>
				The things I get out of it, and why I think it would be useful to others, are: 
				<br>
				<br>
				* Sharing of information, problems, solutions; thus avoiding any mistakes others have made. 
				<br>
				<br>
				* Keeping pace with a fast developing technology. 
				<br>
				<br>
				* The bottom line is that membership of VBUG can save me time and money (and a lot of headaches !).

				VBUG helps you to keep up - Microsoft develops VB at such a rate you hardly have time to get up to speed before the next release appears. VBUG Reminds you that you are not alone.  Others are experiencing the same problems - not only comforting, but better chance of obtaining and sharing solutions. 
				<br>
				<br>
				The VB Developer magazine is excellent. Widens horizons (and encourages me to earmark some of my own ideas to write up when time permits). VBUG Helps to avoid getting 'stuck in the mud'. 
				<br>
				<br>
				New ideas in programming techniques are always interesting, often beneficial. VBUG is an excellent source of technical and training information.

				As an amateur programmer I am always conscious of the fact that what I want from a user group, magazine or book, etc. can be quite different to what the professional programmer needs.  As VBUG is primarily aimed at professional programmers, my views may not be representative of the majority of members. 
				<br>
				<br>
				I belong to VBUG so that I can keep up to date with developments in the world of Visual Basic. The VBUG web site provides much of this information. I enjoy reading the excellent On Line Magazine and I think the Tip/Trick section is useful. I look forward, in particular, to the introduction of the Examples of Code section. 
				<br>
				<br>
				The wide choice of monthly magazines will satisfy most members and the Computer Book discount is an excellent addition to the service. I can thoroughly recommend VBUG to any Visual Basic programmer.

				The price of membership is good value even if you only take a copy of Pinnacle and nothing else its a pretty good deal when you think that any decent book will cost you at least £50.   On top of that you get the opportunity to go to free seminars on the latest developments. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Need a hand... have a real sticky problem? mail the user group. It's often comforting to know that there are other VB'ers in the same situation as yourself (everybody has problems), but someone can usually help. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Vbug is making a reputation for itself, some interviews I've been to,do ask if I'm a member of the user group or if I've heard of them, so the commercial sector are starting to take Vbug and its members seriously. 
				<br>
				<br>
				When somebody mails a question and you can answer it, It does make you feel good knowing that you have been able to help someone. 
				<br>
				<br>
				There is also 15% book discount, The VB magazine, only available through Vbug, that for a serious VB'er I'd say above all else would be the magazine to buy. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Looking for a job post your details on the Vbug Web site. The annual conference, ok we have to pay for that but it was worth it, a chance to meet and speak to some of the 'big boys' in the playground TMS - the mandlebrot set for a start. (Hope to be at this years one too).

				My reason for being part of the group is that I am a sole developer. The group provides information and that is what makes belonging to the group worth it. Everything else is a bonus.

				The fact someone somewhere has already done what you are trying to do, or something close to it, is really nice to know.

				When it comes to developing the best thing available is to be able to communicate with someone with experience of the problem. This is what VBUG provides.

				In these days of impersonal emails, electronic telephony, and the money making attitude of business in general it is good to have an informal, well advised group of like-minded people to search for those truly difficult to uncover problems in the VB myriad.

				I feel that VBUG provides an avenue for discovery, an advisory service of what's hot and what's not in the VB world. 
				<br>
				<br>
				As you will know, I do not attend many of the VBUG meetings, but those that I do attend unerringly provide the answers to the questions that matter.

				But by far the biggest benefit of membership is the fact that I am kept in touch with the latest developments in the VB arena, and this allows me to keep on top of this ever changing world that is my workplace.

			Having membership of VBUG is of great value, mainly because of the
			relatively inexpensive and effective technical help that is offered within
			the membership fee. The problem that I had centred around a three tier
			system which I was developing using Visual Basic 6, Transaction Server
			(M.T.S.) and SQLServer 7.  As you (Graham Parker) had the experience with MTS it meant that
			the problem was solved relatively quickly.

				I have been looking for a way of getting a handle on Microsoft technologies 
				as the Microsoft documentation is almost impossible to find your way through 
				quickly. I am looking forward to learning about .NET and C# with a group of 
				programmers in a similar position to me.

				I am a member of VBUG, having joined late last year. In a few short
				months, the membership fee has more than paid for itself... Not only do I
				receive a periodical, but the technical support, which is free(!), has
				helped me out greatly when I have found myself staring at the monitor
				usually with a look of disgust on my face. The forum hosted on the web page
				is also an excellent resource, and a way of glimpsing how others combat
				similar problems.
				<br>
				<br>

				I would highly recommend becoming a member of VBUG to anyone working with a
				VB environment. I have not yet attended any VBUG events and obviously when I
				do so, the value of being a member is yet greater.

			As a first year member of VBUG, but long time VB developer, I had occasion recently to seek technical help with an issue of using a large Informix database with ADO and oledb. After exhausting almost every other avenue I could think of, Microsoft, Informix and the newsgroups, I remembered the VBUG Technical support phone line and got hold of Graham Parker. Boy do I wish I had done it earlier! within a matter of a few hours graham had located another member, in Scotland, who had worked on similar projects with Informix and put us in touch with each other, 24 hours later problem solved.
			<br>
			<br>
			To have access(!) to a resource like this is invaluable and I would highly recommend anyone who takes VB development seriously to part with the small change needed and get a VBUG membership. My cheque is already made out for next years membership!
