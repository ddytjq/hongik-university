          test </b>&nbsp;The Sigma Autosport Toyota-Atlantic team concluded a 
          four-day test at Carolina Motorsports Park, in Kershaw, S.C., Thursday 
          afternoon. It was the team’s first on-track action since racing at the 
          Tecate/Telmex Monterrey Grand Prix nearly two weeks ago. Sigma 
          Autosport drivers Rocky Moran Jr. and Dave Wieringa had two full days 
          of testing on the .98-mile long track. Moran tested on Monday and 
          Tuesday, while Wieringa had his turn on Wednesday and Thursday. All 
          told, Moran completed 200 miles worth of testing while Wieringa put in 
          approximately 250 miles. Wieringa tested in the rain Thursday morning, 
          but the track dried out enough in the afternoon for more dry runs. 
          “This was a good test for us,” said Sigma Autosport Atlantic Manager 
          Jim Griffith. “The biggest thing for us was getting seat time and 
          having both Rocky and Dave get acclimated to the Swift 014 chassis. 
          Dave had a good test and was improving every minute he was in the 
          car.” Griffith said that except for a brake problem in one of the 
          Swifts, there were no real problems during the test. Wieringa 
          performed some double duty in his #3 Swift and Moran’s #4 car. “I 
          think this test went very well for us,” said Wieringa. “I got the 
          benefit of testing in dry and wet conditions and using both Swifts. We 
          resolved the problems with the brakes and feel very confident heading 
          into Long Beach.” Griffith also added the test was beneficial for his 
          crew as well. “This helps not only Rocky and Dave, but the guys too,” 
          said Griffith. “The team is still fairly new and it was as much a test 
          for them as it was for the drivers. I believe the guys are starting to 
          gel as a team and we’re looking forward to the Long Beach Grand Prix.” 
          First day Atlantic qualifying for the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach 
          begins on Friday, April 12, with final qualifying the next day (April 
          13). The race begins at 10 a.m. Pacific Time.&nbsp; </font><i>

          <b><font face="Arial" size="2">Why Honda would like to see CART back 
          in Brazil</font></b><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp; 
          Honda’s presence in Brazil epitomizes the company’s global outlook. 
          The company’s business in South America originated with the export of 
          motorcycles to Brazil in the late 1960s and has since grown formidably 
          to include all aspects of Honda’s activities. Key developments in 
          Honda’s South American business have always originated in Brazil, with 
          motorcycle and automobile production started in the early 1970s and 
          1997 respectively. Honda’s Manaus motorcycle plant in Brazil now 
          produces more than 400,000 motorcycles annually and has contributed to 
          the growth of the overall motorcycle market in South America. 
          Typifying Honda’s push for higher environmental standards, the plant 
          acquired ISO 14001 certification, the international standard for 
          environmental management systems, in October 1998. While maintaining 
          this motorcycle-based business foundation, Honda began marketing 
          automobiles across South America in the 1980s. Mirroring its 
          successful motorcycle business strategy Honda commenced local 
          automobile production in Brazil in 1997. Honda's power equipment 
          business in South America has rapidly evolved since exports to Peru 
          began in 1966. With a sales network that now encompasses 13 countries 
          across the continent, Honda products such as electric generators and 
          pumps are sold throughout the region. Honda's business includes two 
          R&amp;D offices in Brazil, one for motorcycles and one for automobiles. <i>

          Skip Barber LLC announced the promotion of George Tamayo to the 
          position of Director of Marketing and Communications. Tamayo was 
          previously the Marketing Communications Manager, a position he 
          accepted in September 1999, where he managed Public Relations for the 
          company. In his new role, Tamayo will have responsibility to direct 
          all Marketing functions and staff related to Skip Barber properties 
          which include the Skip Barber Racing School, Dodge/Skip Barber Driving 
          School, Skip Barber Race Series and the Barber Dodge Pro Series. 
          Additionally, he will oversee all of the department's business units, 
          including Sponsor Development, Partner Servicing, Corporate 
          Communications, Web Development, Public Relations, Advertising and 
          Brand Management and Development. &quot;George combines an extraordinary 
          knowledge of the motorsports industry with a keen strategic focus,&quot; 
          said Skip Barber LLC CEO Aaron Hollander. &quot;Moreover, his overall 
          knowledge of the Skip Barber brand and our component business units, 
          backed by one of the best marketing teams in the industry, will prove 
          very valuable as the company moves forward.&quot; &quot;The past two and half 
          years have been enormously fulfilling for me,&quot; said Tamayo. He 
          continued, &quot;I look forward to taking up the charge of keeping the Skip 
          Barber brand positioned amongst the great brands that populate our 
          industry. I wish to take this opportunity to thank those who have 
          helped me get to where I am today, and although there are many, it 
          begins with the outstanding group of individuals that I have the 
          pleasure to work with.&quot; Tamayo replaces former Director of Marketing 
          Jim Bowie, who left in January to join CART as Director of Team, 
          Manufacturer, &amp; Supplier Partnerships. During Bowie's administration, 
          Tamayo was instrumental in rebuilding the Marketing department and 
          launching several key initiatives like daily web site updates, greater 
          public relations interest in race series events and consolidation of 
          all marketing services in house. <i>Skip Barber</i></font></TD>

          Board Members and Chief Executive Officer, Joe Chrnelich, to one very 
          interested race fan, Jerry Zimmerman. Zimmerman has sat in the top row 
          of Section UU watching races from seat numbers 98 and 99 since the 
          early 1960s. Section UU sat just north of the main grandstand and was 
          the largest bleacher section at the track with 5,668 seats. &quot;Today is 
          a great day for us and State Fair Park,&quot; said Milwaukee Mile General 
          Manager, Jim Melvin. &quot;Seeing some visual evidence of this project 
          moving forward is a much needed boost to all of us emotionally...race 
          fans, the State Fair Park board and employees and to us as the race 
          track operators. The new seats will be a vast improvement and this 
          entire project will insure the stability of racing at America's most 
          historic speedway well into the future.&quot; Work has also begun outside 
          of Turn One with the dismantling of eight bleacher sections in that 
          area of the facility. All new seats in Turns One and Four will not 
          only improve the comfort level for race patrons, but sight lines from 
          each seat as well. The first row of bleachers will be elevated ten 
          feet from ground level. In 2003, when the new grandstand is built, 
          patrons who sit in the bleachers assembled in the area of the old 
          Section UU will be integrated into the new grandstand structure.&nbsp;

          Surprisingly, the IRL, which puts out a press release for everything 
          else, chose to not publicize the fact that Lazzaro suffered a slight 
          vertebrae fracture during the accident and will be out for three to 
          four weeks for recovery.&nbsp; Lazzaro will have to sit out both the 
          Rolex Sports Car Series and Indy Racing League races this weekend due 
          to an injury suffered during a crash at last weekend's IRL race in 
          Phoenix. Lazzaro was scheduled to pull double duty at this weekend's 
          event, as he did earlier this month when he ran in both the Rolex 
          Series and IRL races on the same day at Homestead-Miami Speedway.&nbsp; 
          While our best wishes go out to Anthony for a speedy recovery, it 
          can't be ignored that for a driver, those hard concrete walls on an 
          oval track can cause serious injury, and when all your races are on 
          ovals, the risk and stress borne by each driver takes its toll.&nbsp; 
          Already three IRL drivers this year (Caulkins, Beechler and Carlson)

          3/19/02</b> - Anthony suffered a serious 
          back injury when he crashed and got airborne in his ARCA debut at 
          Talladega in Oct. 2000, which resulted in him sitting out the rest of 
          the year and pre-empted him from getting the requisite superspeedway 
          experience needed to race Cal Wells' BGN car at Daytona the following 
          Feb. Is it possible he may have now aggravated this injury, which is 
          why he is not cleared to drive yet?&nbsp; <b>3/18/02 -
          </b>&nbsp;Indy Racing League rookie Anthony Lazzaro was released March 
          18 from Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center in Phoenix without 
          injury after he was admitted to the hospital March 17 after a 
          three-car accident during the Bombardier ATV Copper World Indy 200.&nbsp; 
          Lazzaro, from Acworth, Ga., <b>has not</b> been cleared to drive, said 
          Dr. Henry Bock, Indy Racing League director of medical services. He 
          will be re-evaluated by Bock this week before his driving status is 
          determined. The next Indy Racing League event is the Yamaha Indy 400 
          on March 24 at California Speedway in Fontana, Calif.&nbsp; Lazzaro 
          spun and hit the outside retaining wall on Lap 103 of the 200-lap race 
          at Phoenix International Raceway, also colliding with the cars driven 
          by Eddie Cheever Jr. and Scott Sharp. Lazzaro was transported to Good 
          Samaritan Regional Medical Center, complaining of lower back pain. <i>

          Green is doing some big promotions with Ace Hardware this year tying 
          in CART races. The Long Beach and Chicago races will see in-store 
          promotions that have one enter to win a pair of tickets. Any purchase 
          of Simple Green gets you a free Friday ticket for the LB race and each 
          store will be giving away a pair of weekend tickets. They have 32 
          stores involved in the LB area and 170 stores participating in the 
          Chicago race. Townsend Bell, the Simple Green girls, and the Safety 
          Team and truck will be part of live radio remote promotion being done 
          at Ace stores the Thursday before race weekend. Each race will have a 
          Grand Prize winner receiving a &quot;Safety Team Member For A Day&quot; in which 
          the lucky winner will don a Safety team uniform and headset and be 
          behind the fence along side a safety truck during the race. Their goal 
          with these promo's are to sell more product (obviously) and get more 
          fans in the stands through the in-store promotions. The response from 
          their retailers has been phenomenal!&nbsp; Oh, and did we forget to 
          mention....the Simple Green toy safety trucks are in production too!&nbsp; 
          Simple Green is doing what we have seen NASCAR sponsors do for years, 
          wrap their product lines around racing and together grow the sport and

          June 15-16 event this morning. The committee chose from 96 entry

          Le Mans Series events, the list of 48 also includes many teams that 
          compete in selected ALMS races, including last week's season-opening

          claiming that it's Busch Series is now the #2 most popular form of 
          motorsports in the USA, and based on TV ratings, they are probably 
          correct.&nbsp; And if you want to place the blame on anyone, it 
          clearly falls in the lap of those who created the IRL, since in 1995 
          (the year before the split) CART's attendance and TV ratings <b>far 
          surpassed</b> that of the NASCAR Busch series.&nbsp; However, the 
          split drove a wedge right through the heart of the sport of Indy Car 
          racing, opening up the door for NASCAR to completely dominate USA 
          motorsports. If one were to split NASCAR in half, much like Indy Car 
          racing was split in half when the IRL was created, NASCAR would 
          flounder and die away as well.&nbsp; Here is a portion of the almost

          has evolved into America’s No. 2 motorsports series, lapping 
          open-wheel racing in terms of popularity and potential for further 
          growth.&nbsp; And that was before this season.&nbsp; That was before a 
          trio of second-generation drivers started congregating at NASCAR Busch 
          Series events, drivers with legendary names - names that fans used to 
          associate, primarily, with the Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) 
          open-wheel series. Foyt.&nbsp; Mears.&nbsp; Fittipaldi. Collectively, 
          they represent an imposing trio - drivers of resplendent open-wheel 
          lineage who have noticed the trend in motorsports appeal, and are now 
          going NASCAR racing, in full-bodied, paint-trading stock cars. <b>
          [Editors Note: they bypassed the IRL too, but it's clear NASCAR's 
          intent with this press release was to paint CART in a negative light]</b>.&nbsp; 
          Larry Foyt is A.J. Foyt’s son; Casey Mears is Rick Mears’ nephew; 
          Christian Fittipaldi is Emerson Fittipaldi’s nephew. Those bloodlines 
          are responsible for a total of 10 victories in the Indianapolis 500

          <b><font face="Arial" size="2">CART and K&amp;K Insurance renew deal </font></b>
          <font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;Officials from Championship Auto 
          Racing Teams, Inc. (CART) and K&amp;K Insurance Group announced today that 
          K&amp;K has renewed its business relationship with CART, and has retained 
          its status as &quot;Official Corporate &amp; Special Risk Insurance Company of 
          CART.&quot; &quot;We are delighted to welcome K&amp;K Insurance back for another 
          season with CART,&quot; said CART Vice President of Marketing, Steve Fusek. 
          &quot;For many years they have provided CART and its teams with a great 
          deal of security, and it's great to have them here to manage risk. 
          Clearly, they have seen real value in aligning themselves with us, and 
          everybody in CART will continue to work hard and deliver even more 
          value to K&amp;K in 2002 and for years to come.&quot; K&amp;K is celebrating its 
          50th year of operation in 2002, and has had a relationship with CART 
          since the sanctioning body's inception in the late 1970s. The company 
          provides CART and many of its teams and sponsors peace of mind with 
          regard to insurance coverage, which includes excess liability, owners' 
          and sponsors' liability, participant accident and catastrophic medical 
          coverage, property and casualty, and workers' compensation. &quot;K&amp;K is 
          extremely pleased to renew our long standing relationship with CART 
          and continue to manage their insurance needs,&quot; said K&amp;K Vice President 
          of Motorsports, Dave Hatlem. &quot;CART's international reach as a global 
          sports property is a natural fit for K&amp;K, as we are a multi-national 
          company with offices in Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada. 
          Additionally, CART's leadership in motorsports safety and medical 
          services provides a great platform for K&amp;K to promote our risk 
          management services within the motorsports industry.&quot; In addition to 
          its designation as &quot;Official Corporate &amp; Special Risk Insurance 
          Company of CART,&quot; K&amp;K has been a major sponsor of the Simple Green 
          CART Safety Team since 1989. K&amp;K has also been a sponsor of the CART 
          Medical Center-a state-of-the-art mobile medical facility that 
          services the on-site medical needs of CART drivers, trackside staff, 
          and series officials-since its introduction in 1996.</font></TD>
