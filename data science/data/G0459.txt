    </TABLE><B>September 9, 1999</B>: A future guide book for Solar
    System vacationers might describe Jupiter's moon Europa this
    way: &quot;Europa is cold -- <I>really</I> cold. The surface
    temperature is a chilly -260 deg F, so bring your space parka.
    The entire planet is covered with a relatively smooth layer of
    frozen water and ice skating is allowed in most regions. Travelers
    should bring their own air, as Europa's oxygen atmosphere is
    a million times thinner than Earth's. Other items of note include
    cold water volcanoes, gigantic ice rafts, and an underground
    ocean. Ice fishing is not encouraged.&quot;</P>

    <P>It may sound like science fiction, but most of this fanciful
    description is true. NASA's Voyager and Galileo spacecraft have
    shown Europa to be a frigid world dotted with remnants of &quot;cryo-volcanoes&quot;
    and rafts of ice similar in appearance
 to those seen on Earth's polar seas during
    springtime thaws. As astonishing as the surface sounds, Europa
    may be even more interesting underground. Many scientists think
    that tidal friction from nearby Jupiter heats the interior of
    the moon to temperatures where liquid water is possible.

Beneath
    its icy crust, Europa could harbor the solar system's
    largest ocean! 
<BR>
<BR>
 

  Aside from the novelty of oceans on another planet, scientists
    are fascinated by the possibility of Europan seas because they
    could be sites for extraterrestrial life. Here on Earth, undersea
    volcanoes and hydrothermal vents create environments that sustain
    rich colonies of microbes. If similar systems are active on Europa,
    scientists reason, life might be present there too. If there
    is an ocean on Europa, will it contain life? Chris Chyba of the
    SETI Institute responds, &quot;Can an ocean of liquid water persist
    for 4.5 billion years and not have life in it?&quot; [<A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/0497issue/0497scicit7.html">ref</A>].
    We simply don't know.</P>

    <H2>Mounting evidence...but still not enough</H2>

    <P>Circumstantial evidence for subterranean seas continues to
    mount. New Galileo images released on August 27, 1999, show large
    chaotic areas on Europa's surface where a liquid ocean or warm
    ice may have welled up and disrupted the moon's icy shell. Thera and Thrace
    (pictured <A HREF="#thera">below</A>) are two rust-colored
    areas, each over 50 miles wide, consisting of remarkably
jumbled terrain.
  The latest images show that Thera lies slightly
    below the level of the surrounding plains. Curved fractures along
    its boundaries suggest that the whole region collapsed some time
    in the past. <BR>
<BR>
   Cracking,
    shifting ice rafts. Cold water volcanoes. Gigantic surface melts.
    How long ago did these events take place? No one knows for sure.
    Some planetary scientists think less than 50 million years ago
    based on Europan cratering statistics. That may seem like a long
    time, but to a geologist, it's a brief interval. <BR>
<BR>
     <IMG SRC="../../images/europazoom.jpg" BORDER="2" ALIGN="RIGHT"

     SIZE="-1" FACE="arial,helvetica">: A color-enhanced close-up
    of Europa's surface. Areas of blue are thought to be pure water
    ice. The &quot;cryo-volcanic&quot; ridges have a brown color
    showing where mineral-laden water from underground appears to
    have percolated to the surface through cracks in the crust. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
    &quot;Fifty million years is only 1% of the age of Europa,&quot;
    says Dr. Bob Pappalardo, a planetary geologist at Brown University.
    &quot;Geologically speaking, if something was happening there
    50,000,000 years ago then it's probably still happening today.
    Still, we can't rule out the possibility that Europa's oceans
    have 'recently' frozen. For example, there might be some cyclic
    tidal effects associated with Jupiter and the other Galilean
    satellites that cause Europa to warm up and then cool off with
    a period of a hundred million years. At this point it's speculative.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
    One way to get to the bottom of the mystery
    without actually drilling through the ice is to watch for changes
    on Europa's surface. Photos of, say, an active cryo-volcanic
    geyser would prove that liquid water exists. So far, after numerous
    encounters with Europa Galileo has found no direct evidence for
    liquid water -- just tantalizing hints. <BR>
<BR>
    &quot;Cynthia Phillips, a University of Arizona graduate student
    working with Dr. Alfred McEwen, is also looking for changes on
    Europa by comparing Voyager and Galileo images,&quot; adds Pappalardo.
    &quot;It's difficult work because many of the images are low
    resolution, there are lighting differences to contend with, etc.
    So far they haven't found any definitive evidence for changes
    across a 20 year interval.&quot; <BR>

    is complete melt-through of Europa's icy shell from an ocean

<BR>
    Now that Galileo has completed its scheduled flybys of Europa,
    researchers are poring over the data for additional clues about
    what might lie below the moon's surface. <BR>
<BR>
    &quot;There's lots of research going on,&quot; says Pappalardo.
    &quot;What I and others are doing is refining and testing models
    of how various surface features form. When the Galileo images
    first came out we developed models based on warm ice to explain
    features like we see around Thera and Thrace. Combined with <A
    HREF="http://jumpy.igpp.ucla.edu/~nims/">NIMS</A> [Near Infrared
    Mapping Spectrometer] measurements, these models support the
    idea that the surface may be salty in places. The best spectral
    match is to magnesium sulfate, better known as Epsom salts. When
    warm convecting ice rises up and hits a salty area it melts at
    a lower temperature than the surrounding plains. This sort of
    process might explain regions like Thrace where we see what appears
    to be melting and liquid-like flows across the surface.&quot;

Researchers aren't certain what causes the brown discoloration
    of regions like Thera and Thrace and around cryo-volcanic ridges.
    NIMS data indicate a correlation between brown areas and salty
    spots. <BR>
<BR>
    &quot;The problem,&quot; continues Pappalardo, &quot;is that
    Epsom salt isn't brown. The best candidates for the brown material
    are iron compounds or some sort of sulfur compound. Both iron
    and sulfur are relatively abundant in the solar system and have
    a red appearance visually. Plus, we know that there's SO<sub><FONT
     SIZE="-1">2</FONT></sub> on Europa.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
    &quot;We may not be able to answer all the questions now,&quot;
    says Pappalardo, &quot;but framing the problems is important
    because of the planned Europa Orbiter mission.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
    Still under development, the <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/ice_fire/europao.htm">Europa
    Orbiter</A> will use a radar sounder to measure the thickness
    of Europa's icy crust and possibly determine whether liquid water
    exists below the ice. An on board altimeter will gather topography
    data and characterize the tidal response of the surface. Tidal
    distortions of Europa's crust will be large if there is an underlying
    layer of liquid water and smaller if the water is in the form
    of ice. The mission could launch in 2003 and would serve as a
    precursor to spacecraft that might send undersea explorers into
    the Europan oceans.</P>

    <H2>A Ring Around The Moon</H2>

    <P>Unwilling to wait years for an answer, Dr. Robert Carlson
    and colleagues at JPL recently tried an ingenious experiment
    to solve the mystery now. According to Carlson, a crucial clue
    to the state of affairs below Europa's crust lies in the crystalline
    form of ice on the surface. <BR>
<BR>
    In theory, three different forms of ice can exist at the low
    temperatures and pressures on Europa's surface: amorphous ice,
    cubic crystals and hexagonal crystals. High pressure ices can
    take on other forms, but they are not relevant to Europa. <BR>
<BR>
    &quot;Ice that forms from water vapor at 100 [Kelvin] is amorphous,&quot;
    explains Carlson. &quot;At 140K, ice formed from water vapor
    has a cubic crystalline form. At temperatures above 170K, ice
    formed from liquid water or from 'warm' water vapor has a hexagonal
    crystal, just like ice on Earth. If we could find evidence for
    hexagonal ice crystals on Europa, it would mean that the ice
    formed fairly recently from liquid water or warm vapor.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
    On Earth, hexagonal ice crystals are responsible for a sight
    well-known to stargazers: a 22 degree halo around the Sun or
    Moon when it is viewed through humid cirrus clouds. Similar halos
    can be seen from sunlight glinting off snowy surfaces, especially
    from freshly fallen snow. <BR>
<BR>
    <A HREF="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/PIAGenCatalogPage.pl?PIA01669"><IMG 
    SRC="images/europa/icemodels.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="2" WIDTH="200"

    images of Europa's surface include a subsurface layer of liquid
    water or perhaps warmer, convecting ice. Image credit: JPL and
    the SETI Institute.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
    Carlson and colleagues reasoned that if hexagonal ice crystals
    are present on Europa, they might be able to see a similar effect
    using Galileo's Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer. When sunlight
    hits the surface of Europa at near grazing incidence it penetrates
    the surface and refracts through the ice crystals. Hexagonal
    crystals will produce a ring-like glow in the infrared much like
    the familiar &quot;ring around the Moon.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
    &quot;<A HREF="http://jumpy.igpp.ucla.edu/~nims/">NIMS</A> is
    a spectrometer, but we're not using its spectral capability for
    this work,&quot; says Carlson. &quot;The search for hexagonal
    ice on Europa involves a search for light intensity variations
    as a function of phase angle.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
    &quot;Geometry was crucial for this experiment,&quot; he continued,
    &quot;There was only one orbit when we could do it when the Sun
    was only 22 degrees above the grazing incidence reflection point.
    The spot we observed doesn't have a particular name, it was a
    small patch of ice surrounded by darker material at about 48
    degrees longitude on Europa. The patch was about 100 km across,
    and we could detect hexagonal crystals even if they make up as
    little as 10% of the ice.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
    The observations were played back earlier this year and Carlson
    <I>et al</I> are busy analyzing the data. <BR>
<BR>
    &quot;If we don't see the halo, it doesn't necessarily mean anything,&quot;
    says Carlson. &quot;That's because crystalline ice exposed to
    energetic particle radiation over a period of time becomes amorphous,
    and there is a strong source of radiation in the neighborhood
    -- Jupiter's magnetosphere. No one knows what's the time scale
    for transformation. There has been some lab work at temperatures
    less than 80K, but Europa's surface is warmer than that and the
    time scales are sure to be longer at higher temperatures.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
    If hexagonal ice is discovered, it will certainly spur new lab
    experiments that measure the transformation time, which will
    in turn set limits on the age of the hexagonal ice. In that way
    scientists will be able to &quot;date&quot; cryo-volcanic activity
    on Europa more precisely than ever before, and possibly draw
    definitive conclusions about modern-day Europan oceans. <BR>
    </P>

    <H2>Meanwhile, back on Earth....</H2>

    <P>Many scientists would love to travel to Europa to study conditions
    there first-hand, but regular flights to Jupiter probably won't
    begin for some time. Meanwhile, there is an environment right
    here on Earth with significant similarities to Europa, a place
    called Lake Vostok. <BR>
<BR>

    NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A> In 1974, a team of scientists conducting
    airborne research passed over the Soviet research station Vostok
    in Antarctica. Their sounding instruments detected an expanse
    of water beneath the ice roughly the size of Lake Ontario. Although
    Antarctica records some of the coldest temperatures on Earth,
    Lake Vostok is buried under four kilometers of ice. The ice sheet
    acts as a blanket, shielding the lake from cold temperatures
    on the surface. It is also thought that geothermal heat helps
    keep the water liquid. <BR>

    The extremely deep ice samples from approximately 100 meters
    above the surface of the lake (about 400,000 years old) were
    obtained by an international team of US, Russian, and French

<BR>
    It's possible that Europa and Lake Vostok share a number of remarkable
    properties, including a kilometers-thick covering of ice over
    liquid water, an environment where life may have developed along
    unique evolutionary paths and subterranean waterways accessible
    to remote observation via radio sounding techniques and <I>in
    situ</I> observations by means of melting probes. A group of 
scientists and engineers from JPL, The University of Nebraska, 
and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute have begun 
a research program to identify technologies needed for 
the exploration of both  Lake Vostok  and  Europa. 
This program benefits researchers interested in both 
areas - Vostok is very difficult to explore with 
current technology, but with the infusion of NASA technology a 
safe entry may be possible for the first time. At the same time, 
Europa explorers will benefit from experience obtained at 
Vostok and similar places.  The program is studying designs for 
a cryobot vehicle that would penetrate a thick icy crust and 
a companion hydrobot vehicle that would explore subterranean 
waterways looking for signs of microbial life.

<br><br>
    One of the highest mission priorities for any exploration of
    Lake Vostok or Europa is to avoid environmental contamination.
<BR>
<BR>
    &quot;Lake Vostok is an incredibly precious resource,&quot; Richard
    Hoover said in a Feb. 1999, interview, &quot;and it would be
    a colossal mistake to take samples before it can be done without
    contaminating the waters with chemicals or surface microorganisms.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
    Lake Vostok is clearly a valuable new laboratory for astrobiologists,
    and they intend to proceed very carefully. Whatever we learn
    from this mysterious Antarctic lake will undoubtedly influence
    future missions to search for and explore the waterways of Europa.
