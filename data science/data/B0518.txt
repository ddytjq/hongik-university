      <p>On 20th March 2000 the Society introduced a requirement that any new 
        investing members must assign to Chelsea Building Society Charitable Foundation 
        any windfall conversion benefits to which he or she may become entitled. 
      <p>This requirement applies to anyone who opens a share account with the 
        Chelsea unless that person: 
      <ul>
        <li>has been a shareholding member of the Chelsea continuously since 19th 
          March 2000; or</li>
        <li>has been a borrowing member of the Chelsea continuously since 19th 
          March 2000; or</li>
        <li>belongs, at the date of application, to one of the classes of exempt 
          customers. A list of the classes of exempt customers is available on 
          request from the Secretary at the Society's Principal office. The reason 
          why some individuals are exempt is to avoid unfairness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The agreement to assign any windfall conversion benefits will last for 
        5 years after which the agreement will cease to have effect.</p>
      <p>The reason that Chelsea has introduced this requirement is to avoid disruption 
        to its normal business caused by the action of speculators whose main 
        objective is to receive conversion benefits.</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.thechelsea-charity-foundation.co.uk" target="_blank">Chelsea 
		Building Society Charitable Foundation</a> is a registered charity, constituted 
		so that a majority of its trustees are independent of Chelsea Building 
		Society. It provides financial assistance in the form of grants to registered 
		charities.</p>
      <p><STRONG class="redtext">What do we mean by windfall conversion benefit?<br>
		</STRONG>This means a benefit in the form of a distribution, usually in 
		cash/shares, to shareholding members or depositors under the terms of 
		any transfer of the business of the Chelsea Building Society (the Society) 
		to a company (i.e. on a conversion or takeover). Borrowing members will 
		not be required to assign windfall conversion benefits which may be received 
		by them in their capacity as borrowing members.</p>
      <p><STRONG class="redtext">What do we mean by assigning benefits?<br>
		</STRONG>If your share membership begins on or after the 20 March 2000 
		will have the same rights as any other member including rights to vote 
		on all issues. However, the declaration will have the effect that for 
		the first five years of your membership any windfall conversion benefits 
		to which you may become entitled would, automatically be passed over to 
		the Chelsea Building Society Charitable Foundation (the Foundation).</p>
      <p><STRONG class="redtext">What is the Charitable Foundation?<br>
		</STRONG>The <a href="http://www.thechelsea-charity-foundation.co.uk" target="_blank">Chelsea 
		Building Society Charitable Foundation</a> is a company registered as 
		a charity which will itself make donations to various charitable causes. 
		In addition to the possibility of windfall conversion benefits, the Foundation 
		will receive donations from the Society each year. The Foundation, which 
		will be the focus of the Society's charitable giving, will only make donations 
		to charities registered with the Charities Commission.</p>
      <p><STRONG class="redtext">What if, as a new customer for a Share Account, 
		I am already a member?<br>
		</STRONG>Paragraph 8 of the declaration is included in all investment 
		application forms. However it is drafted in such a way that if you are 
		already a member, through having a shareholding account or mortgage with 
		the Society before 20th March 2000 then paragraph 8 of the declaration 
		does not affect you at all.</p>
      <p><STRONG class="redtext">How long will this arrangement last?<br>
		</STRONG>On or after 20 March 2000, a customer opening a new share account 
		would not receive a windfall conversion benefit if a coversion took place 
		at any time in the five years from the date of account opening. This is 
		subject to certain exceptions. (see below). We expect that these arrangements 
		will remain in force indefinitely, but the Society has the power to end 
		the scheme if it decides that this is in the best interest of the Society. 
		If that happened, customers who had already signed a declaration would 
		continue to be bound by it but new customers would not be required to 
		assign any windfall conversion benefits to which they may become entitled.</p>
      <p><STRONG class="redtext">If I want to transfer my investment account to 
		a new investment product offered by the Society will I lose continuity 
		of membership?<br>
		</STRONG>Provided that the transfer of funds from one investment product 
		to another is made simultaneously then no loss of continuity of membership 
		will occur. However, if there is a break between the closure and reinvestment 
		then you will lose your continuity of membership and, on opening a new 
		account, your membership history will run from the date the new account 
		is opened.</p>
      <p><STRONG class="redtext">On a transfer of my investment account will I 
		be required to agree to assign my windfall conversion benefits for a further 
		5 year period?<br>
		</STRONG>You will be required to sign a new declaration form (which will 
		include Part 8) but, provided you have continuity of membership, the relevant 
		charitable assignment period will run from the date you opened your earlier 
		share account. The same principles will apply if you open a second, or 
		another share account.</p>
      <p><STRONG class="redtext">If my Share Account is in my sole name and I 
		want to change the account into the joint names of myself and someone 
		else will the incoming account holder be required to agree to assign any 
		windfall conversion benefit (s)he may become entitled to if the Society 
		converts?<br>
		</STRONG>Yes, unless the new account holder is already a member. You are 
		reminded however that, in respect of a joint shareholding, only the Representative 
		Joint Shareholder will be entitled to receive any windfall conversion 
		benefits. Your rights will be unaffected by the transfer of the account 
		into joint names.</p>
      <p><STRONG class="redtext">If I transfer my account to someone else will 
		that person benefit from my period of membership?<br>
		</STRONG>No. In respect of membership history each account holder is treated 
		separately. It may be that the person to whom you transfer your account 
		has their own membership history with us. If not Part 8 of the declaration 
		form will apply to them, unless the transfer of the account satisfies 
		one of the exceptions to the charitable assignment scheme mentioned below.</p>
      <p><STRONG class="redtext">What are the exceptions?<br>
		</STRONG>Existing members at 20 March 2000 are excluded from the scheme. 
		On or after 20 March 2000 new mortgage customers would still be entitled 
		to any windfall conversion benefit coming to them as borrowing members. 
		(Valid applications to open accounts received but not processed before 
		20 March 2000 will not be affected). In order that customers whose accounts 
		are held by others on trust are not unfairly treated, the following applications 
		for transfer of an account will result in the existing account holder's 
		history being transferred to the new account holder:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>transfer of account from a deceased member to a personal representative, 
          widow(er) or child under 18 years old.</li>
        <li>transfer of a trust account held for a named beneficiary when the 
          trustee changes but the beneficiary remains the same.</li>
        <li>death of first named account holder where a second named account holder 
          becomes the first named.</li>
        <li>transfer of a designated child's trust account into the child's name 
          when (s)he attains sufficient age.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The effect of this is that no new 5 year period will begin as a result 
        of any of these events.</p>
      <p><STRONG class="redtext">Does this mean the Society is going to convert 
		to a Bank?<br>
		</STRONG>The Society has never wavered in its commitment to remain a building 
		society. The Society's results and the value delivered to members show 
		that mutuality works. These arrangements will ensure that it can deliver 
		that value to all.</p>
