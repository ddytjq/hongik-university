<h1>Fundamental Offensive Skills</h1>

<p>Notice: This article was written by Steve Jordan, <a href="http://www.akcoach.com">Coach's
Notebook. </a>Email the author at <a href="mailto:sjordan@alaskalife.net.">sjordan@alaskalife.net.</a></p>

<p>There are 4 fundamental offensive skills. The four basic skills an offensive player
must learn (in alphabetical order) are dribbling, passing, shooting and &quot;what to do
without the ball&quot;. The last category includes V cuts, setting screens and rebounding.
</p>

<h2><a name="Dribbling">D</a>ribbling </h2>

<p>From young to old, players love to shoot more than performing any
other basketball skill. But when they really want to impress their peers, what to they do?
Yeah, they dribble. Behind the back, between the legs, chin high bounces - these are all
tricks brought out to demonstrate mastery of the game. The greatest feat is to cause the
defender to fall down with a fake and sudden change of direction, metaphorically
&quot;breaking his ankles&quot; in the process. The crowd goes wild. The second greatest
feat is to single-handedly best the full court press, splitting defensive traps and
evading steal attempts. The crowd nods in agreement that they are in the presence of a
fine basketball player. So, with such incentives, many players spend lots of time
practicing crossover and spin moves. </p>

<p>Ball handling skills are very important, especially when protecting the ball from an
aggressive defense. Dribbling skills are also difficult to learn and take concerted effort
to master. It is very aggravating to lose possession of the ball because a player does not
have sufficient proficiency in a given situation. An important point here is that such
turnovers are not nearly as aggravating as possessions lost during showboat maneuvers. I
have seen countless instances where a player at the top of the key, with no defensive
player near him, begin to go into his dribbling routine, only to have the ball bounce off
his foot and go out of bounds. If &quot;breaking someone's ankles&quot; is the greatest
dribbling achievement, surely this particular turnover is the most shameful. The second
most frustrating dribbling blunder is the player that drives between two defenders and has
the ball stripped away. Many teams devote hours practicing press-breaking plays to get the
ball upcourt safely and quickly. All that time is wasted when players decides to &quot;go
against the numbers&quot;. That is why you see some coaches get so upset at their players
during a game. The parents see a player losing the ball, but trying his best to help the
team. The coaches see a player deliberately making a bad choice. Another attribute that is
becoming more important in today's basketball game is sheer strength. It is no longer
fashionable for referees to call fouls against steal attempts in the backcourt. It is hard
for a coach to keep emotions in check when players come into the huddle bruised, bleeding
and humiliated from no-calls. There are two answers to the problem: be more physical than
the defense, or (duh!) pass the ball more. It is no big feat to destroy a full court press
without using any dribbles at all.</p>

<p><strong>Things to practice</strong>: Dribbling skills require frequent practice,
concentrating on a few basic principles. Hardworking players will become very comfortable
handling the ball and will perform feints and maneuvers instinctively. Insist that players
be attentive to the following tips:</p>

<p><strong>1. Keep the head up.</strong> Do not look at the ball. Tell players that the
ball will rise off the floor every time without being supervised. Players who look down
when they dribble will not see open players down court. They also will not see defenders
well enough to protect the ball.<br>
<strong>2. Use both hands equally</strong>. The easiest player to guard is one that can
only dribble with one hand. Such a player can be herded, will have difficulty shooting and
passing when moving to the weaker side, and is very predictable. The one handed player is
essentially double-teamed even when he has a single defender. <br>
<strong>3. Do not allow players to let the ball rest in their hand,</strong> cup it, or
roll their hands from bottom to top of the ball. These actions are tempting because they
enable greater control (and flashier moves), but they are illegal and a decent referee
will be sure penalize the player in a game. <br>
<strong>4. Protect the ball </strong>by keeping the body between the ball and the
defender. <br>
<strong>5. Practice controlled movement</strong> left, right, forwards and backwards, all
while keeping eyes forward. <br>
<strong>6. Practice transitions between directional changes</strong> (step back and
cross-over, behind the back, between legs). Do not allow guards to turn their backs to the
defense. They will not see pass receivers and they will not see the defense making moves
to steal the ball.</p>

<p><strong>Dribble Drills: </strong>Here are some simple (and fun) drills to develop
dribbling skills. Try ones that seem appropriate for your age group and modify freely as
needed.</p>

<p><strong>1. </strong>As in a relay race, <strong>split the team into several parallel
lines</strong> and ask players to advance the ball to halfcourt and back using a specific
skill, i.e. two dribbles left hand, step back and cross ball to right hand, then advance
two steps dribbling right handed. Step back, cross-over and repeat. Subsequent sets can
include other transition moves and feints, i.e. while dribbling right-handed, head and
shoulder fake left, but retain ball on right side. <br>
<strong>2.Match players up 1:1.</strong> Have one player dribble, the other defend.
Restrict the lane to about 12 feet wide to further contain the dribbler. The defensive
object is to gain possession or trap the dribbler at the side of the lane. The dribble
must advance the ball going side to side, protecting the ball with the body and using
transition skills from one hand to the other.<br>
<strong>3. Match dribbler against two defenders</strong>. Good defensive practice and
hopefully will teach dribblers to avoid such confrontations. For the younger players (or
those that have no weak hand skills). <br>
<strong>4. </strong>Line the kids up in a convenient close formation so you can see them
easily. Have them bounce the ball with either hand, but get them to <strong>all dribble in
unison</strong> without going anywhere, You should hear a massive boom-boom-boom as the
rhythm kicks in. Then, in a cadence, warn them that at the count of three, everyone will
switch to the other hand. I have found that when the kids try to switch hands individually
they often lose the ball. In concert, however, the results are surprisingly successful and
the players become confident. <br>
<strong>5. Give the players two basketballs each. </strong>Have them move forward bouncing
both balls at the same time and again with alternating left/right dribbles. Advanced
players can bounce the left side ball to the right hand and vice-versa.<br>
<strong>6. Play dribble tag</strong>. Its just like tag, but one must have control of the
ball tag another. </p>

<h2><a name="Passing">P</a>assing </h2>

<p>Teach your players to pass. Please. It is a much more valuable skill
than dribbling. Passes should be simple, snappy and short. Eliminate behind the back or
&quot;no-look passes&quot;. Misdirection, using the eyes and a slight body fake to mislead
the defender, is effective and reliable. Reckless showboat passes please the crowd when
they work, but they usually don't and the perpetrator ends up in an embarrassing light,
perhaps even on the bench. Snappy means to pass the ball with sufficient velocity that it
is difficult for defender to deflect. With misdirection AND snappiness, the ball can be
passed close to the defender if desired, Short passes reduce the chance for interception
and are easier to perform accurately. </p>

<p>Watch for&nbsp; <b>&quot;Shooter's Syndrome&quot;.</b> Your
best scorer is a poor passer, why is that? Passes to open players are difficult
to catch or just enough so to sabotage the shot. Is there a subconscious effort
there to protect the individual's status as top scorer? I've seen this too often
not to call it a syndrome. If your scorer is not passing to open players or
throwing the ball behind them when they have a lay up, or at their feet, etc.,
action must be taken. Accusing a player of being selfish is dangerous. However,
you can demonstrate how important passing is by benching the culprit for poor
passes or neglecting open players. If you think the cost of losing a good
shooter is too high, consider that value minus the points not made by the other
players, lower morale and subtle (or not so subtle) retribution by teammates.</p>

<p>Just mentioned was the admonition against showy passes. More prevalent and dangerous
are passes that are best described as weak - low velocity and aimless. Such passes are
easily and frequently intercepted. Strong passes are created with an understanding of
technique and focused concentration. Its surprising how many &quot;advanced&quot; players
cannot throw a chest very far or with much control. To teach your players passing skills,
try these notes on technique. Then, there a few drills to try. </p>

<p><strong>Chest Pass </strong><br>
<strong>1.</strong> Hold the ball chest high, fingers spread comfortably, thumbs pointing
down <br>
<strong>2.</strong> Take one step forward as the ball is thrown <br>
<strong>3.</strong> Push the ball forward, using the arms, but most importantly, finish
the release with the wrists snapping inward, thumbs together. With practice, the ball can
be passed crisply for a surprising distance. <br>
<strong>4. </strong>Insist on accuracy. The easiest pass to catch is one received at chest
level; the hardest to catch is at the feet.</p>

<p><strong>Overhead Pass </strong><br>
More to the point, this is a toss. The thumbs are under the ball, but the action is
initiated by the little fingers snapping forward. Use this pass carefully because it is
easy for a defender to protect the area directly above.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b> Baseball Pass</b><br>
Used for long
distance, fast break situations. This is a difficult and risky pass due to the length the
ball travels and precision required to hit the target. Errant baseball passes often go
over the receiver or curve significantly and go wide of the mark. Another danger is the
load placed upon the thrower's shoulder. It is possible to damage a rotator cuff if the
ball is thrown too hard. <br>
<strong>1. </strong>Throw the ball directly overhand, not side-arm. The ball should show a
rapid backspin which is parallel to the floor. If it spins perpendicular to the floor, it
will curve. <br>
<strong>2. </strong>Keep the pass low. A long skip pass is easier on the arm and it will
not sail over the receiver. The higher route should only be used if necessary to go over
defenders. <br>
<strong>3. </strong>Lead the receiver. At long distances, players often misjudge the speed
of the receiver. If the pass is behind the receiver, it will be necessary to stop and
catch the ball, allowing the defense to recover. In that case, a risky pass has been
employed and no gain realized.</p>

<p><strong>Shovel Pass</strong><br>
This pass is thrown off the dribble, as the ball comes up to the dribblers hand, in an
underhand motion. This is a sloppy, inaccurate pass. I will bench a player for using it.</p>

<p><strong>Receiving the Pass</strong><br>
Teach players to step forward when receiving passes. Tell them to come and meet the ball,
essentially beat the defense to the ball. Catch the ball with two hands. If the receiver
is in the low post, help them create space so the passer has a definitive target. The post
player should have a feel where the defense is and, with a wide stance and arms extended,
make an obvious spot for the pass.</p>

<p><strong>Passing Drills </strong><br>
<strong>1. </strong>Divide the team into two facing lines. If there are enough
basketballs, pair the players so they can pass to each other. Start with a short distance,
6-8 feet. Then, in stages have each player take a step backward. Always concentrate in
technique. Once the players are separated by 15' or so, watch for passes that lose
altitude (or not even reach the target without bouncing!) and help those players. There is
no value in practicing passes outside the players range or if accuracy cannot be
maintained. <br>
<strong>2</strong>. Line the team up around the jump ball circle. Put one player in the
middle. The player with the ball must pass either to the person directly across the circle
or to the two adjacent players. If the player in the center can deflect or intercept the
pass, or if the passer misses the three possible targets, the passer exchanges places with
the defender. Practice misdirection with the eyes, bounce passes, passes under the
defender's arm, etc. Have the players back up a step for more of a challenge. <br>
<strong>3.</strong> Have the players form two lines at one side of the court. The first
two pass the ball back and forth as they progress down the floor. No dribbling is allowed.
Increase speed as proficiency grows. Emphasize crisp passing and leading the receiver. Add
lay-up at completion of journey. <br>
<strong>4.</strong> Players lay on the backs and hold the ball near their chest. Pass the
ball straight up, then catch it. This simple drill takes a lot of concentration,
especially the the height of the pass increases. </p>

<h2><a name="Shooting">S</a>hooting </h2>

<p>Successful shooting is based upon three elements with a distinctive
priority: Confidence, Selection and Technique.</p>

<p><strong>Confidence</strong><br>
A player may have perfect technique and may take an easy uncontested shot, but if the
confidence level is low, the shot may well be missed. Some players seem to have an
inherent self-confidence that carries them through. In fact, some shooters make baskets at
critical times, yet use terrible technique and make a bad choice to shoot altogether.
Still, they succeeded because they believed they could score despite the odds. So, what is
the choice of a conscientious coach? Should players be exhorted to emotional levels that
enable great shots of faith? Should players be infused with a sense of individual
superiority to achieve the same end? The answer, I believe, is to attain the necessary
confidence level through frequent practice predicated upon the underlying factors of
selection and technique. If a player has made a shot a thousand times in practice, there
shouldn't be a problem with confidence. When a player takes shots that have been
practiced, knowing that it is the right shot at the right time, the percentage will be
acceptable. The problem with emotionally driven teams/players is that the emotion cannot
be sustained at high levels over time. As a result, there are large stretches of flat
performance that negate the magical moments. Emotion enables great deeds and big plays and
are ideally reserved for big moments. There are certain factors that erode confidence. At
the least, it is scary to perform in front of other people knowing that your mistakes will
be exposed for all to see. Its also scary knowing you may be publicly defeated. Its easy
to talk big, but at game time the proof is on the court. Part of being a team is sharing
those particular fears. Your teammates give you courage.</p>

<p>Additional factors that reduce a player's self confidence are: <br>
<strong>1. </strong>Lack of trust and support from teammates, such as teasing, put downs
or resentment. <br>
<strong>2. </strong>Criticism from coaches, especially following a missed shot <br>
<strong>3.</strong> Lack of practice. Players that have not paid their dues working on
free throws, for instance, will not feel comfortable at the free throw line. <br>
<strong>4. </strong>Emphasis on personal goals instead of team success. Players worried
about personal point totals make poor choices. <br>
<strong>5. </strong>Intimidation from the other team, especially concern over having shots
blocked. See shot blocking.</p>

<p><strong>Shot Selection</strong><br>
Much of this site is devoted to risk management as a basketball philosophy. The winning
team is usually the one that gets the most shot attempts. If the number of shot attempts
is similar, it comes down to which team best managed their shots. If one team earns an
extra 15 shots over the other due to their effort at offensive boards or forcing
turnovers, yet squanders those attempts on shots of extreme difficulty, then it has wasted
its advantage.</p>

<p>Each of the shot types listed below costs the team one forced turnover or one offensive
rebound, usually achieved by someone other than the shooter. Its not fair. Patience will
usually pay off in a shot that is easy to make and demoralizing to the opponent. Wasted
shots are:<strong> <br>
1. </strong>Drives to the basket without a opening. The only salvation is a foul. <br>
<strong>2. </strong>Shots well outside the shooter's effective range.<br>
<strong>3. </strong>Shots taken when the shooter has lost body control.</p>

<p><strong>Shot Technique</strong><br>
There are several illustrated books available written by shooting experts. Read a few.
Then watch professional players and study their technique in action. Study your players.
Its not hard to spot deficiencies if you think in terms of body alignment and consistency
of motion towards the basket. The hardest trick isn't spotting the problem. The difficulty
is in convincing a player to change a habit. Most players will simply work harder to
perfect bad form and while eventually achieving their potential, don't get very accurate.
The smart player adjusts knowing that good technique equates to higher potential. When a
player changes a habit, performance often suffers while the new skill is being developed.
Too many lose faith at this point and revert to the bad habit. Here are some common faults
seen in shooters of all ages. <br>
<strong>1.</strong> Twisted body. Align feet, hips, shoulders perpendicular to the basket.<br>
<strong>2. </strong>Inconsistent release. Watch the fingers as the player follows through.
Do they turn away from basket at release? <br>
<strong>3. </strong>Non-vertical movement. Does the player leave the ground at an angle?
Motion should be straight up or slightly toward the basket. <br>
<strong>4.</strong> Elbow flare. The elbow should remain close to the body. If it sticks
out to the side, the shot will vary side-to-side and tend to be flat.<br>
<strong>5. </strong>No arc. The ball should travel well above the rim (15-17' at peak).
Flat shots have a very small window to enter the basket. A nicely arced shots sees most of
the basket circumference as it descends. Also, the ball is more likely to bounce up off
the rim rather than back to the shooter. <br>
<strong>6. </strong>Ball on palm. The ball should be balanced on the fingertips during the
shot, not resting on the palm where control is lost. There should be a discernable gap
between the ball and the palm. This habit is a carryover from when the players are too
small to hold the ball correctly.  The thumb of the shooting hand should
have a 45 degree angle up and toward the ball.<br>
<strong>7. </strong>Shot initiated from the hip or chest. Another carryover from days when
so much strength was needed to merely reach the rim. Shots should generate from the triple
threat position. The elbows should be at eye level when the shot is released. The higher the shot release, the harder
it is to
block.&nbsp;  </p>

<p><strong>Shooting Drills </strong><br>
Repetition is the key. Players should develop muscle memory for favorite shooting spots.
After shooting from a given location hundreds of times, making that particular shot can be
nearly automatic. <br>
<strong>1. Side to side.</strong> Lay the ball up right handed (jumping off left foot),
catch the ball and immediately shoot left handed on the left side of the basket (jumping
off the right foot). Rinse and repeat. Repeat continuously for 2 minutes then alternate
with a partner. Concentrate on using the backboard, elevating on the shot, jumping off the
proper foot and, of course, making all the shots. <br>
<strong>2. Progression.</strong> Stand 2 feet from basket. Shoot a nice easy shot into the
basket. Avoid hitting the rim. Make it perfectly. Concentrate on form, follow-through,
rhythm and arc. Do not practice bad habits. After 2 minutes, alternate with partner. Then,
move back two more feet and repeat. The last round is when three-point shots are
practiced. <br>
<strong>3. Give and Go.</strong> Shooter passes to a high post then moves quickly to an
open spot (3-4 steps), receive the pass back from the post and immediately shoots. Key
points are maintaining balance after passing by cutting, stopping when receiving the ball,
pivoting on the foot towards the center of the court, jumping straight in the air with the
shoulder and hips perpendicular to the basket.<br>
<strong>4. Spot shooting.</strong> Feed the shooter at a stationary position. Keep track
of how many shots are taken and made. Shoot as many shots as you can (i.e. 100) before
trying another spot. <br>
5. Lay-ups - the most common shot. There are many drills, from the two lines with one
shooting one rebounding, to intricate passing preludes before the shot. The main idea is
to practice lay-ups at game speed. Strive for maximum height and accuracy. This shot must
be so familiar to the player that it is made instinctively. <br>
<strong>6. X Drill</strong>. Dribble from left side of free throw line (elbow) and make a
left handed lay-up. Retrieve the ball and drive out to the right elbow keeping the ball on
the outside - away from the center of the court. Once at the elbow, pivot and change
dribbling hands so the ball is still away from the center of the court. Drive in and make
a right handed lay-up. Repeat 1,000 times.</p>

<p><a name="Free Throws"><strong>Free Throws</strong> </a><br>
Check out the new <a href="freethrows.html">free
throw article</a> in the topic menu. Here is some quick advice:<br>
 
Practice when tired. Practice with &quot;stakes on the line&quot;. I like to have the
players shoot free throws during conditioning drills offering small rewards such as one
less repetition for making the shot. Simplicity, consistency of form is crucial. All of
the tips listed under the Shot Technique section apply. Stand directly behind players as
they shoot and watch for non-essential movements or improvised compensations (player
making last second changes in form. Observe the follow through motion of the hand - does
it point straight to the basket? Also, observe the spin of the ball as it travels towards
the rim. It should be spinning directly backwards fast enough that the individual seams on
the ball are not easily distinguishable. A ball that does not spin or rotates side to side
indicates improper release. </p>

<h2><a name="What to Do Without the Ball">W</a>hat to Do Without the Ball </h2>

<p>The primary skills everyone knows are dribbling, passing and
shooting. However, it is the behind the scenes action by players who do not have the ball
that often make the difference between an effective team and a team that just doesn't seem
to reach its potential. A player should be thinking every second, trying to find a way to
contribute to the team. Because basketball plays usually involve only two or three
players, the best contribution at times is to stay out of the way and keep your defender
from helping to defend the ball. Nonetheless, a player that is a threat even without the
ball (because of constant movement to get open) can exhaust a defender and prevent
teammates from being double-teamed.  </p>

<p>Stress the value of V cuts Camera angles from above the basketball
court vividly show how much open space is available for an active player. If you are not
open where you are, move. The most effective way to get open to move directly to the
basket (or towards the ball) so the defender is committed to moving in a predictable
direction, then sudden change direction to a desired open area. The reaction differential
should provide a usable window of opportunity to receive a pass. V cuts are hard work, but
that is also true for the defender who must continually adjust and spend more energy doing
so than the offensive player. Lazy cuts that can be diagrammed with curves instead of
straight lines are easy to guard. Travel far enough that the defender must move with you.
Some offensive players make their cuts so short that the defender merely stands in place
and adequately defends his opponent.  </p>

<p>A very useful trick - and absurdly simple, too - is to notice when
the defender looks away from his man. At that moment the man he is guarding should change
position. The defender will look back and, with alarm, realize he's lost his man. A quick
cut to the basket may mean an easy basket. The coaching challenge is to get the rest of
the team to recognize the advantage. Young players are so absorbed in their personal
situation that they are often oblivious to sudden openings for their teammates. When
practicing your offensive patterns, tell the team that only a certain player can score.
That will help them watch for the target player through the entire offensive process. It
will also help the offensive target learn to work hard constantly to get open. </p>

<p>Players that can screen are the quiet, yet indispensable
contributors. Most plays call for a screen somewhere in the process. When these plays
fail, it is usually because the expected screen never happened. Unplanned screens are
good, especially when set for a teammate without the ball. Its easier to pick off his
unsuspecting defender that it is screening&nbsp; for the ballhandler. &nbsp; Screens
should be set behind and slightly to the side of the defender. Contact should occur
because the offensive player about to be freed herds his defender into the screen. </p>
