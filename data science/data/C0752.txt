<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">
<P><B>Their current album went straight into #1 in the USA, they're one of the most frequently requested artists on MTV and they almost caused a riot last time they visited New York. They're called Korn and chances are you probably haven't heard of them... </B></P>
<P>Formed back in the early 90's in <B>Southern California</B>, Korn are a five-piece meshing dark, urban rhythms and low-tuned guitar sludge with violent, expressionist blasts of hip-core noise. Fronted by the wildly emotional vocal delivery of singer <B>Jonathan</B>, the band released their latest opus <B>&quot;Follow The Leader&quot;</B> in mid-August last year.</P>
<P>Just <B>how</B> popular are Korn then? To promote the launch of the record, the band hit the road on the <B>&quot;Korn Kampaign&quot;</B> - a series of signings across the USA. One such stop in <B>New York</B> brought a deluge of 7,000 fans with a police sergeant on the scene quoting &quot;This was the biggest in-store we've ever seen in New York City, and even <B>crazier</B> than when the <B>Spice Girls</B> were here&quot;.</P>
<P>Korn's huge fan base is in part due to the fact that they were one of the first bands to pick up on the <B>huge potential</B> of the Internet as a marketing medium. Before the release of their last album <B>&quot;Life is Peachy&quot;</B> in 1995, the band broadcast over the web an innovative live album release party from the studio, giving fans the opportunity to <B>hear</B> the new tracks and <B>call in</B> to speak to the band.</P>        
<P>Taking things a step further, with the release of last year's <B>&quot;Follow The Leader&quot;</B>, the band launched a string of weekly shows with the tongue-in-cheek title of the <B>&quot;Korn After School Specials&quot;</B>. Again, transmitted live from the studio on their own <A HREF="/cgi-bin/url_log.cgi?url=www.korntv.com" TARGET="_top"><B>KornTV</B></A> web site, this time round the shows gave a look into the work-in-progress on the record as well as special guest appearances from other bands and celebrities.</P>        
<P>But what of more traditional media? The recent success of their video <B>&quot;Got The Life&quot;</B> on <A HREF="/cgi-bin/url_log.cgi?url=www.mtv.com" TARGET="_top"><B>MTV</B></A> came a surprise to many who believed that heavy music was dead (for some time only the safe pop sounds of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/url_log.cgi?url=www.backstreetboys.com"><B>Backstreet Boys</B></A> and <B><A HREF="/cgi-bin/url_log.cgi?url=www.nsync.com" TARGET="_top">N'Sync</A></B> received more requests). Singer <B>Jonathan</B> comments, &quot;It's cool, at least we're making <B>some leeway</B>. You know, someone's gotta bring rock back&quot;, adding that &quot;I'm not saying we're trying to be the saviours of heavy rock or whatever - but you gotta do it to make it come back.&quot;</P>
<P>With <B>&quot;Family Values&quot;</B>, one of the most ambitious tours of 1998 under their belt, their own newly-formed record label (<B>Elementree</B>) and another groundbreaking video featuring animation from renowned comic-book artist <A HREF="/cgi-bin/url_log.cgi?url=www.spawn.com" TARGET="_top"><B>Todd McFarlane</B></A> airing shortly, 1999 looks sure to continue Korn's success. Despite how it sounds though, the last word is down to them:</P>
<P>&quot;We're not out to <B>change the world</B>, just <B>music</B>&quot;.</P>
