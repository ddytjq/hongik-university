      Formula One race, the Australian Grand
                  Prix, came back when the ALMS returned in 2000.&nbsp;But that
      race has since been cancelled and the city begs for a big-time race to put
      itself back on the international map.&nbsp; Should a CART race be that
      event?</font>

                  CART product is enhanced by extremely successful races such as
                  Surfers Paradise Australia, Monterrey, Mexico, Mexico City,
                  Toronto, Vancouver, etc.&nbsp; Take a potential sponsor to one
                  of those races and you are likely to come away with a contract
                  in hand.&nbsp; Success breeds success.&nbsp; Everyone wants to

                  that with CART's weaker venues, which portray CART as a
                  'loser', an undesirable so-to-speak.&nbsp; CART has shed most
                  of its 'loser' races over the past three years, but there are
                  still a few that must be jettisoned from the schedule.&nbsp;

                  to pass.&nbsp; Those people are right to some extent, and it's
                  CART's fault for agreeing to race on a track that is

                  right around 3,000 feet long. Facilities were also first rate.&nbsp;
                  The pit garages for teams and the FIA were described as some of the classiest, and mechanics relished the workspace, with room to store

                  complacency.&nbsp; Adelaide’s organizers and government,
                  were convinced that their race was safe, but they were caught with their guard down when officials from Melbourne, Adelaide’s
                  arch-rival, offered F1 Supremo Bernie Ecclestone more money, a
                  lot more money, and successfully stole the event right out
                  from under Adelaide's nose. When this happened, the headlines
                  in one Adelaide newspaper read - ‘Melbourne rat bags poach our race’.&nbsp;</font>

                  is nowhere near as special as Adelaide. The track is situated quite a distance from the city, which gives the race an almost
                  ‘middle of no-where feel, ' very much like Michigan
                  International Speedway feels, built out in no-mans land of
                  Michigan.</font>
    </p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 1"><font size="2" face="Arial">Melbourne isn't drawing any more people to it's Grand Prix than Adelaide; although by world standards last years race-day crowd of 107,000 was highly successful, it was down substantially on the 154,000 of the 1996 crowd.
      The final race in Adelaide in 1995 was remarkable, establishing an all-time race-day record of 205,000.</font>

                  ALMS went to Adelaide in 2000, over 65,000 fans showed up for
                  the race.&nbsp; While not as many as the 205,000 that came for
                  the last F1 race in 1995, it was a healthy crowd
                  none-the-less.&nbsp; However, it wasn't big enough to pay the
                  huge cost to fly the series all the way to Australia, so the
                  ALMS contract terminated early and Don Panoz sued the City. According to Adelaide's
                  <i> The Advertiser</i>, Panoz Motor Sports Australia filed an
                  $18 million suit against former South Australia premier John Olsen, the South Australia Tourism Commission and the Motorsports Board for compensatory damages after the organizers cancelled the event after only one event of a nine-race contract.&nbsp;
                  Panoz dropped that lawsuit back in November.</font>

                  V8 Supercars still race at Adelaide, but the race doesn't draw
                  the kind of crowds a joint weekend with CART would.&nbsp; </font><font size="2" face="Arial">Australia’s premier motorsport category V8 Supercars have extended their contract with the South Australian Government and event
    organizers Clipsal 500 for a further five years.  The confidence shown by the South Australian Government guarantees the Clipsal 500 race remains in Adelaide until 2008.&nbsp;</font>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
    <font size="2" face="Arial">However, our Australian contacts tell us that V8
    Supercars don't like sharing the top-billing with CART as they are hugely
    successful in their own right.&nbsp;</font>
    </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">So my suggestion to make a CART double header work in Australia? Stick with
      the October dates with the races separated by one week. This will give the
      driver's a chance to relax and holiday for a few days in Australia, fans to
      recover from one weekend to prepare for another and a chance to have driver's be interviewed by local media to promote the series. Maybe even a
      promotional go-kart event could be organized in Sydney or Melbourne with some CART drivers attending to meet the younger fans and future stars of the
      sport. This event would be a great showcase for the CART organization and would raise the profile of motor racing in general and show young kids just
      how professional race car drivers got started in the sport.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"> As for support races I would leave Surfers Paradise with it's existing complement of V8
      Supercars and GT-Production racing, as well as the Young Guns concept introduced by Honda at the past two Surfer's Indy.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">For Adelaide I would look at Formula Ford, Formula 3, Young Guns and a
      GT-Production Enduro race, to be held after Indy Qualifying on Saturday night. My suggested hours are from 6:00-9:00 pm so the race would start at
      twilight and finish in darkness giving it the feeling of a mini Le Mans, while leaving plenty of time for people to still go out and party
      afterwards.&nbsp;</font></p>

    <font size="2" face="Arial">CART is making a serious mistake by not racing
    in markets that can generate this sort of enthusiasm.&nbsp; </font><font face="Arial" size="2">CART still prefers to cater to the
    30,000 or so fans that may
            show up at Houston, Chicago&nbsp; or Milwaukee.&nbsp; Even though
            each CART race broadcast reaches some 100 million eyeballs,
            regardless of where in the world CART races, catering to the 30,000
            fans at these ventures is important to CART because many of its
            sponsors have budgets paid for out of USA marketing budgets and they
            have told CART they want more US races.&nbsp; CART's sponsors are
            telling CART how to run its business.&nbsp; The tail is most
            definitely wagging the dog.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

    </p>
    <p align="left">
    <font face="Arial" size="2"> The challenge before CART's
            marketing team is to talk to the international marketing folks (or
            the holding company) of these firms to help them understand that
            CART reaches a lot more people worldwide than the 30,000 or so
            sitting in the grandstands at some of these USA races.&nbsp;
            Meanwhile CART is forced to overlook key venues like Shanghai,
            Adelaide, Monza or Imola (all would have huge attendance) and
            potential new sponsors see all the empty grandstands at the weak USA
            venues and ask themselves, why would I want to be involved with an
            organization that appears to be a loser with all those empty seats?&nbsp; </font>

    </p>
    <p align="left">
    <font face="Arial" size="2">Perception
            is half the battle.&nbsp; Sponsors perceive NASCAR as successful
            because all their grandstands are full.&nbsp; When they see a CART
            race and all those empty seats, the perception sends the marketing
            folks at potential new companies for CART running for the door. This is
            one example where the tail wagging the dog is holding the dog back while
            the vultures circle overhead. </font>

    </p>
    <p align="left">
    <font size="2" face="Arial">The final word on Adelaide's event goes to the recently deceased senior statesman of Grand Prix racing, Ken Tyrell.  Interviewed in the United Kingdom after electing not to attend the Melbourne race, and reflecting on his 30-year career in Grand Prix racing, Tyrell said he had never had any
    favorite circuits, adding that this subject was a matter for the drivers.  Then he paused and said there was one exception.
    "It was always very pleasant when we finished up the season in Adelaide, where we got a wonderful reception from the people there," he said. "And it was very, very nice setting in which to wind up the season and have a party."</font>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
    <font size="2" face="Arial">Melbourne, Australian race fan Christopher
    Skinner backed that up with this quote, &quot;being Australian and a huge fan of open
    wheel racing I would also love to see a CART race in Adelaide and have often thought to myself that it would be a hugely successful event. I attended the last three Adelaide Grand Prix's and every Melbourne Grand Prix and despite being from Melbourne I enjoyed the Adelaide events considerably more.&quot;</font>
