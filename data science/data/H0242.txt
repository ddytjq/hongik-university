<hr>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Warm-blooded, active and almost
sharp-witted is the general idea in public and scientific circles
of how the dinosaurs were. Were they really such creatures?
Nobody knows, but objective considerations lead to the conclusion
that they generally were not.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">For the first many years after
their discovery it was generally held that the dinosaurs were
reptiles. They were extraordinary large reptiles and in many
respects very different from recent reptiles, lizards,
crocodiles, and turtles, but still reptiles. Therefore it was
never really considered whether they were warm- or cold-blooded:
As reptiles are cold-blooded, dinosaurs too were considered to be
cold-blooded.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">From the beginning of the 1970s
the idea, however, emerged that they were not cold-blooded
reptiles</font><a href="#warm"><font color="#FF0000">*</font></a><font
face="Times New Roman">), but warm-blooded animals, and
enthusiastically advocated by the adherents of this new concept
the former picture of the dinosaurs was changed from the slow and
sluggish, stupid reptiles into active and agile, fast, and
quick-minded, almost intelligent animals of their own class, or
at least: not reptiles. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It should, however, be stated
that no proof at all of their warm-bloodedness has been
presented. All that has been forwarded to support the
warm-bloodedness is circumstantial, not to say speculative or -
to be very frank - wishful thinking. It depends on one's own
&quot;belief&quot;, if the arguments of warm-bloodedness in
dinosaurs are persuasive. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>The problem, and what makes it
interesting.<br>
</b></font><font face="Times New Roman">The problem concerns with
the metabolic rate in dinosaurs. It is claimed by the adherents
of the dinosaurian warm-bloodedness that the dinosaurs had a high
metabolic rate and therefore were very active - or vice versa.
And as reptiles have low metabolic rate and therefore are slow
and generally inactive, the dinosaurs were not reptiles, but
something else, a class of their own.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The metabolic rate is the
relation of an animal's - and man's - intake of food and -
roughly speaking - what is made out of it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">When an animal eats, the food is
used for its growth and for moving and performing any kind of
vital processes that needs material or energy. The more the
animal should grow, move, and perform other vital processes, the
more food it has to eat, and the faster it has to eat and digest,
transforming the food into flesh and energy. The faster the
animal transforms the food into energy, the higher is the
metabolic rate.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The vital processes are
enzymatic, chemical processes which function optimally at certain
temperatures. Therefore, the most economical use of the food for
growth and displaying of life is obtained when the temperature of
the animal's body is close to this optimal temperature.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The optimal temperature of the
vital processes is - within limits - a matter of adaptation,
governed by the principle of natural selection. Animals which
constantly live in cold environments may adapt to this by
evolving a low optimal temperature, and vice versa.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This seems rather simple, but
most animals don't live in environments with constant
temperatures; on the contrary: most animals live in surroundings
where the ambient temperature changes all the time, depending on
the climate of the site, the time of the day and the year, the
latitude, light and shadow, and so on. But the optimal
temperature of the animal does not change according to the
ambient temperature.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">A means to counter this problem
is to evolve an optimal temperature of the vital processes
according to an average temperature of the relevant environment.
When the ambient temperature exceeds some narrow limits, the
animal must either decrease its vital processes until the ambient
temperature again appropriates the optimal temperature, or it
must migrate to a place where the ambient temperature
accommodates the optimal temperature. If the ambient temperature
is too low, the animal must move to a place where the temperature
is high enough to raise its body-temperature to the optimal, and
vice versa if it is too high. If the temperature of the
surroundings for a longer while is low beneath the optimal
temperature, that is in cold nights or in winter-seasons, the
animal should decrease its vital processes to a minimum and
survive in a state of lethargy. This is what modern reptiles and
amphibians do. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">But mammals and birds have -
independently - evolved an ability to maintain a constant
body-temperature, correspondent to their optimal temperature.
This ability is called &quot;warm-bloodedness&quot; or
homeothermy, - even-temperature - contrary to
&quot;cold-bloodedness&quot; or poikilothermy which is the lack
of this ability.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The problem is whether the
dinosaurs were homeothermic. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>The need of warm-bloodedness.<br>
</b></font><font face="Times New Roman">Homeothermy is the
ability to raise the body-temperature when it is too low, and to
lower it when it is too high. That is the principle of
thermostatic. To raise the temperature is for the animal to
produce heating by its metabolic process which ability is
endothermy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">A general question to be asked
about the dinosaurs' warm-bloodedness is what might have caused
them to evolve endothermy and homeothermy, as this power in fact
has been obtained by mammals and birds, and not by reptiles. What
good reasons, and what benefit is that power for mammals and
birds, and why not for reptiles and amphibians?</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In animals which shall be active
in the hours of the day when sunheating can be found if the
ambient temperature is low, and shadows and other kinds of
coolness can be found when it is too high, the lack of
warm-bloodedness is a little or no problem as they rather easily
might obtain the optimal body-temperature. In the hours of the
night and in seasons with low ambient temperatures, they may
decrease their life-processes to a basical and stay inactive in a
state of tumour until the ambient temperature raises and elevates
their body-temperature. This is the case for recent reptiles and
amphibians; they never evolved warm-bloodedness as they never
needed it. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Otherwise for animals which need
to be active at ambient temperatures below the optimal
body-temperature. If they have evolved the optimal
body-temperature for their basical vital processes according to
the peeks of their ambient temperature, and they must be active
at lower temperature, they have a problem, especially if they are
small animals. Bulky animals might &quot;storage&quot; the high
body-temperature to save it for the periods with low ambient
temperature, but small ones are forced to produce internal heat
by their own means, endothermy. This was the case of the
ancestors of mammals and birds, but hardly the case of the
ancestors of the dinosaurs, as these were neither particularly
small nor forced to be active at low ambient temperatures.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>The endothermic process.<br>
</b></font><font face="Times New Roman">Raising of
body-temperature takes place in any animal, as muscle movements
produce heating, a phenomenon known from the shivering when we
are cold. The evolution of endothermy is most likely a refinement
of muscle shivering. But the costs of this kind of heating is
that it demands energy, and this must be obtained from intake of
food. This also demands energy, as well for providing the food as
for digesting and other processes which also demand energy and
still more food - ect. Therefore endothermy is an expensive
quality, and it is unlikely that the dinosaurs, or any other
group of animals, evolved it, unless they had very good reasons
for it. And the bulkiness of the dinosaurs in general and the
heat which they must have produced simply in moving their great
masses of muscles must have produced such amounts of heat that
the special power of endothermy were completely superfluous. On
the contrary their problem was rather to get rid of the heat from
the muscle-movements and get cooled. In that sense endothermy in
dinosaurs might have been present, but not as a special quality
as in birds and mammals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Warm-bloodedness in mammals.<br>
</b></font><font face="Times New Roman">The ancestors of mammals,
which evolved endothermy, were abundant in the Permian. At the
end of this period and at the beginning of Triassic the climate
grew still dryer with very warm day-hours and very cold nights
which was due to minimising of carbondioxide (CO2) in the
atmosphere and consequently a decrease of the greenhouse-effect. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This caused an extensive
extinction of many organisms, among others of the mammal
ancestors. The only ones to survive were some small ones which
could seek shelter in caves, under rocks and in other places
where the ambient temperature in day-hours were modest. They
therefore adopted the temperature of about 37</font><sup>o</sup><font
face="Times New Roman"> C. as their optimal body-temperature. But
in the open the ambient temperature was indurable, why they were
forced to seek their food in the hours of the night when the
ambient temperature was rather below the optimal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Then the power of raising the
body-temperature to the optimal should be rewarded by the
possibility to seek food in the cooler darkness.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The endothermy might have evolved
gradually in these small mammal-ancestors, at the beginning by
performing muscle-movements or shivering in the early dark hours
after sunset to maintain the optimal body-temperature. Later on
these muscle-movements became &quot;invisible&quot; reflections,
governed by the central nervous system, when the body-temperature
sank below the optimal. During their evolution this governing of
heat-producing muscle-reflections became still more refined and
were combined with the evolution of various kinds of insulation,
furs and layers of fat to maintain the expensive body-heat. The
endothermic power was also supplemented with various means to
lower the internal temperature, such as sweating, gasping,
leading of blood-streams to particular surfaces of the body, so
that an efficient thermo-regulation could be obtained.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The evolution of the
warm-bloodedness in the mammal-ancestors gave these animals the
great benefit of being night-active. This again provoked the
evolution of other mammalian traits, such as the sharp hearing
with ear flaps and the vibrissae to make them able to orientate
in the darkness. And it provoked the power of suckle the youth
which were hidden in shelter in the first days after birth.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Warm-bloodedness in birds.<br>
</b></font><font face="Times New Roman">The birds obtained
warm-bloodedness much later and for quite a different reason: The
bird-ancestors, which evolved the homeothermic condition, were
also very small animals, reptiles closely related to the
ancestors of the dinosaurs. In order to protect their hatchlings
from their persecutors, they laid their eggs in the flat crowns
of the palm-like cycads, but here the hatchlings were exposed to
the heat of the sun with no, or little possibility to seek
shadow. In order to sustain the heat, they developed an optimal
body-temperature, close to the ultimate limit of what any
vertebrate can sustain, some forty degrees C. They evolved the
feathers as a protection against sunrays and they further evolved
a special system of air sacks, connected to their lungs, which
made them able to ventilate the body-cavities and thus lower
their body-temperature. But as they fundamentally were
ground-living animals, they should seek their feed on the ground
where the ambient temperature was much lower. Then the
precautions to sustain the heat in the tree-tops became a
draw-back as the feathers prevented them from being sun-heated
and the air sack-system cooled them off, lowering their
body-temperature beneath the optimal for activity. Therefore it
was an evolutionary benefit for these animals to evolve the power
of endothermy, as this made it possible for them to stay inactive
in the heat of the cycad-top and to be active in the coolness on
the ground. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>The benefit of warm-bloodedness.<br>
</b></font><font face="Times New Roman">The warm-bloodedness,
which separates mammals and birds distinctly from other
vertebrate classes, gave them the preconditions for the further
evolution into the leading vertebrate class: It enabled them to
be mentally active all the time. When the reptiles and
amphibians, due to low body-temperature have to be inactive, they
are in a state of anaesthesia, not feeling or sensing anything,
and nothing but the increase of body-temperature can bring them
out of this state. They are not even physically, but also
mentally inactive and completely helpless and unable to defend or
protect themselves. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">But the homeothermy made mammals
and birds able to stay mentally active all the time, and in order
to sustain this very tiresome quality, they &quot;invented&quot;
the peculiar state of inactivity: The sleep. The sleep differs
from the anaesthetic character of the reptilian inactivity, as
relevant impressions of the senses wake the animal up to sudden
necessary activity, flight or defence. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Were dinosaurs warm-blooded?<br>
</b></font><font face="Times New Roman">The problem is also
whether endothermy was present in all dinosaurs. The dinosaurs
were not a single group of animals, but several groups of animals
which had little in common except an archosaurian origin and the
designation of &quot;dinosaurs&quot;. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">As endothermy is not present,
neither in the tuatara and lizards, which descend from the group
of diapside reptiles from which the archosaurs originated, nor in
crocodiles, the only recent archosaur, it seems little likely
that the archosaur-ancestors of the dinosaurs possessed this
quality. And it seems unlikely that it evolved independently in
all the groups of dinosaurs as there is no reason to think that
they all had an urgent need to evolve endothermic homeothermy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This does not, however, exclude
that some degree of endothermy might have evolved in some groups
of dinosaurs, and it is more than likely that it was present in
those bird-like dinosaurs of Cretaceous which derivated from the
avian lineage at a stage when warm-bloodedness was obtained.</font></p>
