<P><B>Firewalking is the practice of walking over red-hot coals. As a rule,
it's generally accepted that these coals have an average temperature of
1200 degrees Fahrenheit.</B></P>

<P><B>Firewalking</B> has been part of many widely <B>diverse cultures</B> throughout history and into the present era.  Despite this, it's only entered western culture <B>comparatively recently</B>, with an upsurge of interest in the early 1980's with the formation of the US-based <B>"F.I.R.E."</B> - the <A HREF="http://heartfire.com/firewalk/pages/tolly.html#institute">Firewalking Institute for Research and Education</A>.  Formed by <B>Tolly Burkan</B>, it developed a series of workshop courses devoted entirely to firewalking, based on his experiences with a friend who'd previously studied with a <B>Buddhist monk</B>.</P>
<P>The <B>upsurgence</B> in interest could be coupled with <B>disillusionment</B> in today's society where <B>commercialism</B> and the drive for <B>material gain</B> has become the norm. Advocates of firewalking almost see it as a <B>religion</B> believing that it is compelling evidence of the human mind's ability to interact with and <B>alter reality</B> in ways not yet understood by science.</P>
<P>One advocate of firewalking has said that he believed it was a <B>spiritual force</B> of BioEnergy that protected him from the fire which was triggered off by intention coupled with enough <B>belief</B> to actually try it. Other cultures have known this force as mana, ki, num, Kundalini, Prana, and a host of other names.</P>
<P>However, as you can imagine firewalking as a phenomena of <B>mind over matter</B> has its skeptics.  Dr Robin Allen, firewalking expert from the Wessex Skeptics, in a recent lecture at Southampton University, declared that there is <B>no mystery</B> about why people can walk over coals at temperatures of several hundred degrees C without coming to <B>any harm</B> as it all comes down to the <B>physics</B> of heat conduction.</P>
<P>Physicists have studied the <B>phenomenon</B> since the 1930s and have concluded  that the normal walk can <B>easily be explained</B> by the fact that coal has a very low heat capacity. Also, the high <B>heat conduction</B> ability of the body cools the feet and injuries are <B>avoided</B>. </P>
<P>"Its like <B>opening the oven</B> to take out a baked cake", Dr Allen said.  "Everything in the oven is at the same temperature, the air, the metal cake tin and the cake. You have <B>no fear</B> of putting your hand in the oven - that's because the air is a <B>poor conductor</B> of heat and doesn't immediately <B>burn you</B>. But the metal cake tin will!"</P>
<P>The same applies to firewalking. The wood or coal that is normally used is a <B>poor conductor</B> of heat and would only cause burns if feet stayed in contact long enough for the heat energy to be <B>transferred</B>. </P>
<P>Final advice from Dr Allen who has actually <B>performed several firewalks himself</B> is "take brisk light steps, with toes curled upwards and <B>don't hang around</B>".</P>
<P>So if you fancy your <B>hand</B> (or should that be <B>foot</B>) at firewalking check out some of the sites listed here and <B>extinguish your curiosity</B> once and for all!</P>
