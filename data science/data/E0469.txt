<h1><b>C++ Applications</h1> </b>
</center>
<p align=right>
Modified July 3, 2002
<p>
Here is a list of systems, applications, and libraries that are completely or
mostly written in C++. Naturally, this is not intended to be a complete list.
In fact, I couldn't list a 1000th of all major C++ programs if I tried, and
this list holds maybe 1000th of the ones I have heard of. It is a list of
systems, applications, and libraries that a reader might have some familiarity
with, that might give a novice an idea what is being done with C++, or that
I simply thought "cool".
<p>
I
(<a href="homepage.html">Bjarne Stroustrup</a>)
don't make any guarantees about the accuracy of the list. I believe that
it's accurate -- I trust the people who sent me examples, but I have not
seen the source code myself. I have a preference of C++style code over
code that are called C++ eventhough it is mostly C.
<p>
The organization of this list is idiosyncratic. Where a set of applications
are clearly associated with a single organization, I list it
under the name
of that organization, but some systems doesn't fit that pattern.
<p>
No, I don't know what all the acronyms mean.
No, I don't have contact people for every system.
Yes, I do list something as C++ even if it relies on non-standard extensions.
Yes, I'd appreciate more examples -- especially major applications.
If you send one, a URL to a support site would be appreciated.
No, I will not list an application, system, or library unless I think the
listing will be of interest to a lot of people -- I'm emphatically not trying
to make a complete list.
I make no pretensions of "fairness", such as promising to list all competing
products in an area if I list one -- this is a list trying to give an overall
impression, not a list to help you select a product.
I rewrite descriptions as little as possible, but I do remove obvious
advertising.
<p>
Thanks to all who sent me examples.
Suggestions for additions and corrections are welcome.

<b>KDE</b> from linux is written in C++.
K Desktop Environment, is a powerful Open Source graphical desktop

environments for Linux.
It consists of about 300 different packages written in C++, including
an office suite, a browser, development tools, games, and multimedia apps.
<li>
a major ballistic missile defense system being done using C++.
<li>
The <b>National Census Bureau of Israel,</b> is written mostly in C++, with some
components of embedded SQL. It
serves millions of transactions per month, starting with birth and death
registration, naturalization, passport issuance, visas and so on for 8
million civilians and foreign workers.
<li>
<b>telephone systems</b>: I think it would be almost easier
to list the systems which aren't written in C++, at least here in
Europe:
<ul>
<li>
C++ is the only development language used for Alcatel transmission
    systems, both for network management (using ILog Views) and the
    actual transmission equipment.  FWIW, the major transmission nodes
    (Frankfurt, Berlin, Munich, and another somewhere in northern
    Germany -- Cologne or Hamburg, I think) in Germany are all 100%
    C++.  All telephone calls between different regions in Germany
    pass through one of these machines.
<li>
T-Mobile (the largest German cellular operator) uses C++ for both
    its billing system and for most of its WAP portal -- dynamic
    allocation of IP addresses, etc.
</ul>
Put differently, anyone using a telephone in Germany depends on code
written in C++ -- that's a lot of users:-).
What counts as a user?  The main telephone transmission nodes in
Germany (and I'm pretty sure France as well) are written in C++.  And
I can't imagine anyone in the country who doesn't use a telephone --
does that count as 80 million (140 million with France) users of C++?
<li>
<a href="http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2001/02/15/anderson.html">SETI@home</a>
Huge collaborative project to analyse data to find signs for extraterrestrial
life. Partly written in C++
<li>
<b>Symbian OS</b>:
<a href="http://www.symbian.com/technology/why-diff-os.html">rationale</a>:
"[...] using C++ for all system code, from the
kernel upwards."  This is one of the most widespread OS's for cellular
phones.
