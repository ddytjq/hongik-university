        scattered planetesimals in their vicinity.  Some of these scattered objects should have
        been ejected out into the realm of the Oort cloud.  Hence, it's possible to have an

Dynamical stability in the outer solar system and the delivery of short period comets
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1993AJ%2E%2E%2E%2E105%2E1987H&db_key=AST
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=1993AJ%2E%2E%2E%2E105%2E1987H&db_key=AST&link_type=GIF
A survey is presented of test particle stability in the outer solar system. Test particles are numerically integrated for
durations ranging from 20 to 800 million yr. No evidence is found that Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune cannot retain
Trojan-like asteroids on time scales of 20 million yr. Test particles placed on orbits near Saturn's Lagrange L(4) and
L(5) points experience close encounters with planets on short time scales, but test particles further from the Lagrange
points remain for the full integration. Most test particles in the Saturn-Uranus and Uranus-Neptune regions are
removed in 10 million yr, excluding small regions between Uranus and Neptune in which a few test particles endure the
full 800 million yr integration. Test particles on initially circular orbits between Jupiter and Saturn are removed by close
encounters with the planets on time scales of 10 exp 4 to 10 exp 5 yr. The above mentioned results provide an insight
concerning the hypothesized Kuiper belt of comets, whose mass estimate is given.

Chaotic behavior and the origin of the 3/1 Kirkwood gap
Icarus (ISSN 0019-1035), vol. 56, Oct. 1983, p. 51-74. 1983
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1983Icar%2E%2E%2E56%2E%2E%2E51W&db_key=AST
The sudden eccentricity increases discovered by Wisdom (1982) are reproduced in numerical integrations of the
planar ecliptic restricted three-body problem, verifying that this phenomenon is real. Mapping derivations are
qualitatively reviewed and the maximum Liapunov characteristic exponent and its importance for determining the
character of a trajectory are explained. The results of a number of calculations of this exponent using the differential
equations for the unaveraged three-body problem are shown and compared to equivalent calculations using a
mapping. In all cases the two approaches agree whether the orbits are chaotic or quasiperiodic. The mappings are
used to trace out the chaotic zone near the 3/1 commensurability, both in the planar-ecliptic problem and in the
three-dimensional elliptic problem. The outer boundary of the chaotic zone coincides with the boundary of the 3/1
Kirkwood gap in the actual distribution of asteroids within the errors of the asteroid orbital elements.

WISDOM, J.
The origin of the Kirkwood gaps - A mapping for asteroidal motion near the 3/1 commensurability
Astronomical Journal, vol. 87, Mar. 1982, p. 577-593. 1982
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1982AJ%2E%2E%2E%2E%2E87%2E%2E577W&db_key=AST
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=1982AJ%2E%2E%2E%2E%2E87%2E%2E577W&link_type=GIF&db_key=AST
A mapping of the phase space onto itself with the same low-order resonance structure as the 3/1 commensurability in
the planar-elliptic restricted three-body problem is obtained. This mapping is about 1,000 times faster than the usual
method of numerically integrating the averaged equations of motion. It exhibits some surprising behavior that might
provide a key to the origin of the Kirkwood gaps. It is noted that a test asteroid placed in the gap may evolve for a
million years with low eccentricity (less than 0.05) and then suddenly jump to large eccentricity (greater than 0.3),
becoming a Mars crosser. The removal of the asteroid by a close encounter with Mars would then be possible. As a
first test of this hypothesis, a distribution of 300 test asteroids in the area of the 3/1 commensurability was evolved for
two million years. When the Mars crossers are removed, the distribution of initial conditions reveals a gap at the
location of the 3/1 Kirkwood gap.

The dynamical perturbation of a system made up of the type of icy planetesimal expected to be present in a
trans-Neptunian comet belt, by a few Mars-to-earth-sized planetoids in highly eccentric orbits, is presently examined
in view of a 0.002 earth-mass cometary belt lying between the orbit of Neptune and 200 AU. Due to the strong
gravitational scattering exerted by the hypothetical planetoids, the number of trans-Neptunian belt comets thus derived
can be taken as a lower limit. Lacking such large planetoids, a two-orders-of-magnitude larger population of
trans-Neptunian belt comets might exist.

A large number of trans-Neptunian comets might have been detected by the Hubble Space Telescope. If a significant
fraction of these Halley-sized objects are stored in the 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune, random gravitational
scattering by the Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) with diameters in the hundred km range is found to be of potential
importance in destabilizing the resonant orbits and hence acts as an injection mechanism of short-period comets. The
relevant feeding rate of short-period comets from the 2:3 resonant population is estimated to be comparable to the
injection rate as a result of dynamical sculpting by long-term planetary perturbations. Similar dynamical interaction
could also lead to the injection of KBOs of a few hundred km diameter from the 2:3 resonant zone into the region
inside the orbits of Neptune and Uranus. The comet-like object, 2060 Chiron might be such an example. The number
of similar objects is estimated to be 5-10, while the total number of KBOs of 100 km size or larger leaking across the
orbit or Neptune, e.g. Centaurs, may be on the order of 50.

Discovery of the candidate Kuiper belt object 1992 QB1

The discovery of a new faint object in the outer solar system, 1992 QB1, moving beyond the orbit of Neptune is
reported. It is suggested that the 1992 QB1 may represent the first detection of a member of the Kuiper belt
(Edgworth, 1949; Kuiper, 1951), the hypothesized population of objects beyond Neptune and a possible source of
the short-period comets, as suggested by Whipple (1964), Fernandez (1980), and Duncan et al. (1988).

We present numerical orbital integrations of thousands of massless particles as they evolve from Neptune-encountering
orbits in the Kuiper belt for up to 1 Gyr or until they either impact a massive body or are ejected from the Solar
System. The median dynamical lifetime of these objects is 4.5 x 10^7 years. We found that about 30% of these
objects became visible comets. (We refer to a comet with perihelion distance <2.5 AU as a ``visible'' comet.) Of
those, 99.7% were Jupiter-family comets (as defined by their Tisserand parameter, hereafter ``JFCs'') when they first
became visible, although some evolved out of the Jupiter family as time progressed. By comparing the observed orbital
element distribution of JFCs to that produced by our simulations we deduce that JFCs are statistically most likely to
have physical lifetimes of ~12,000 years. Based on this estimate of physical lifetimes and the fact that there are ~110
active, visible JFCs with H_T < 9, we conclude that there are currently ~1.2 x 10^7 ecliptic comets (those with T >
2), of sizes consistent with this absolute magnitude, that originated in the Kuiper belt. This conclusion assumes that the
rate of objects leaving the Kuiper belt has remained approximately constant over the history of the Solar System. We
calculate the orbital distribution of this population and show that ~90% are beyond the orbit of Neptune at any given
time. In addition, we calculate the impact rates of these objects onto the planets. We find that a JFC impact onto
Jupiter happens approximately once every 400 years and one on the Earth should occur once every 13 million years.

Results are presented of numerical integrations over billion year time scales of the orbital evolution of more than one
thousand test particles on initially low-inclination, low-eccentricity orbits within the proposed Kuiper belt beyond
Neptune. Particles which eventually crossed Neptune's orbit often showed long periods (up to several billion years) of
relatively low-eccentricity oscillations punctuated by a very rapid jump to Neptune-crossing eccentricity. This flux may
be the ultimate source of present-day short-period comets. It is found here that there exists a correlation between
Liapunov and crossing times in the Kuiper belt. None of the particles in the study with Liapunov time scales greater
than about 1 Myr actually became a Neptune-crosser in 4 Gyr. An intricate structure to the region between 35 and 45
AU is found at the end of the billion year simulation. Implications for the origins of short-period comets and the
detectability of objects currently in the Kuiper belt are discussed.

The key results of an extensive series of numerical simulations of the evolution of comet orbits due to the gravitational
perturbations of the giant planets are presented. The results show that the inclination distribution of comets with large
perihelion that evolve to observable comets is approximately preserved. Thus, the short-period (SP) comets, which
are mostly in prograde, low-inclination orbits, cannot arise from gravitational scattering of any spherical population of
comets. However, the distribution of orbital elements of SP comets arising from a population of low-inclination
Neptune-crossing comets is in excellent agreement with observations. It is concluded that the SP comets arise from a
cometary belt in the outer solar system.

The long-term dynamical behavior of small bodies in the Kuiper belt

The results are presented from a new numerical technique to determine the long-term dynamical behavior of objects in
the Kuiper belt. According to this model, it is possible for some objects that formed in a well-defined region of the
Kuiper belt to have lifetimes of approximately 5 x 10 to the 9th yr, after which they leave the region between 30 and
100 AU. Therefore, the Kuiper belt can be the source of short-period comets. Objects tend to diffuse through a
region 70 AU in extent on timescales that are on the order of the age of the solar system. Objects that form close to
the orbit of Neptune have a significant chance of evolving to orbits with a greater than 100 AU. These objects can be
effectively stored in these orbits for a very long time.

The Kuiper Belt

The Kuiper belt is a ring of icy planetesimals, i.e. comets, beyond theorbit of Neptune, a remnant of the formation of
the solar system. These volatile-rich bodies never accreted into a planet because of the decreasing surface density of
the solar nebula accretion disk and the increasingly long orbital periods at large heliocentric distances. The inner region
of the Kuiper belt, between 34 and 45 AU, is dynamically active with an estimated population of $\sim 6 \times 10^9$
objects, and it is likely the source of the Jupiter-family short-period comets. The dynamically inactive region beyond
45 AU may extend out to $10^3$ AU or more and may contain up to several times $10^13$ objects with a total
mass of several hundred Earth masses. Observational searches have so far discovered 18 objects in the Kuiper belt,
ranging in diameter from $\sim 90$ to 350 km. IRAS dust disks around nearby stars are likely similar, comet belt
structures.

Planetary perturbations and the origins of short-period comets

To investigate the dynamical plausibility of possible sources for the short-period comets, a representative sample of
comet orbits in the field of the sun and the giant planets was integrated, with the aim to determine whether the
distribution of orbits from a proposed source that reach observable perihelia (q less than 2.5 AU) matches the
observed distribution of short-period orbits. It is found that the majority of the short-period comets, those with orbital
period P less than 20 yr (the 'Jupiter family'), cannot arise from isotropic orbits with perihelia near Jupiter's orbit,
because the resulting observable comet orbits have the wrong distribution in period, inclination, and argument of
perihelion. The simulations also show that Jupiter-family comets cannot arise from isotropic orbits with perihelia in the
Uranus-Neptune region. On the other hand, a source of low-inclination Neptune-crossing orbits yields a distribution of
observable Jupiter-family comets that is consistent with the data in all respects. These results imply that the
Jupiter-family comets arise from a disk source in the outer solar system rather than from the Oort comet cloud.

Perturbations on an extended Kuiper disk caused by passing stars and giant molecular clouds.

We assess the importance of stellar and giant molecular cloud perturbations on extended Kuiper-like disks. We
integrate numerically the equations of motion assuming circular orbits for the test Kuiper-disk particles and that the
external perturber (either a star or a GMC) moves on a straight path. GMCs are modeled as very diffuse structures
with a few dense clumps of 10^3^M_{sun}_, so the bulk of a GMC perturbation is assumed to arise from the sum of
the contributions of independent encounters with the dense clumps. We find that external perturbers can induce
eccentricities of about 0.04-0.08 over the solar system age on Kuiper-disk objects in initially circular orbits of radii
100-500AU. Relative changes of the semimajor axis are of the same order, thus allowing radial excursions of some
tens AU. This migh have important consequences in the accretion process and in the collisional evolution of
Kuiper-disk members. Furthermore, due to small radial excursions, Kuiper-disk objects closer to the planetary region
can be injected into chaotic zones. Changes in the orbital inclinations are of a few degrees, thus having little
consequence on the flattened structure of the disk. Perturbations by GMCs are found to be much smaller than those
caused by passing stars. Yet, the much faster increase of the GMC perturbations with the semimajor axis, ensures that
they will become dominant at Oort cloud distances, in agreement with some previous results by different authors. We
find a non-zero probability (a few tenths percent) of dynamical disruption of the outer portions of circumstellar disks
(say at radii >500AU) over the solar system age.

Hidden worlds: Hunting for distant comets and rogue planets

The discovery of the Jewitt-Luu objects orbiting the Sun beyond Pluto is discussed. They are referred to as `objects'
because the experts are still debating whether to classify them as planets, asteroids, or comets. They may lie within the
Kuiper belt, the hypothetical reservoir of comets postulated by Gerard Kuiper to exist in the ecliptic plane just outside
the region occupied by planets. The discovery of the Jewitt-Luu objects lends strong support to the notion that the
Kuiper Belt really exists. The use of occultation astronomy to unlock the secrets of the Kuiper Belt is presented.
Topics covered include the following: Kuiper Belt occultations, gravitational lensing by rogue planets, and telescope
array design.
