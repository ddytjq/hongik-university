<h3><i>Cyclospora cayetanensis</i> - a new parasite of man </h3>
 by Dr. K. Kowalewska and Dr. D. Purych<br> 

<p><i>Cyclospora cayetanensis</i>  is a newly recognized coccidian parasite that has been implicated in cases of prolonged diarrhea in residents and visitors to several countries worldwide. Previously known as CLB's, or Cyanobacterium-like bodies, the organism was initially linked to prolonged diarrhea in tropical countries. The outbreaks as well as sporadic cases started to emerge in a range of locations worldwide, including the US and Canada. </p>
<p><i>Cyclospora sp</i> infection presents with a watery diarrhea (1 to over 8 loose stools per day), 
associated with nausea, anorexia, abdominal cramping, with bloating, flatulence, malaise and fatigue. Myalgias and flu-like symptoms  may be encountered, however fever is rarely present. A mild to moderate weight loss has been noted in many cases. Onset can be  abrupt (68%) or gradual (32%).  </p>
<p>Diarrhea is usually intermittent but self-limiting; and in the immunocompetent host it may last from four to 107 days. Incubation period ranges from 1 to 7 days and shedding 7 to 70 days. Duration and outcome of the disease are highly variable in immunocompromised patients, particularly AIDS patients, ranging from two weeks to several months with full recovery. In one reported case, death occurred within two weeks of diagnosis. </p>
<p>Pathogenesis of <i>Cyclospora</i> diarrhea is not yet fully understood. Absence of fecal leukocytes and red blood cells, characteristic for this condition, indicates non-invasive mechanism(s). The diarrhea appears to be secretory in nature, as indicated by excessive production of watery fluid by intestinal epithelium. Duodenal and jejunal biopsies revealed variable degrees of villous blunting, atrophy and crypt hyperplasia; impaired D-xylose absorption was documented in some cases. </p>
<p>Patients with <i>Cyclospora</i> infection have demonstrated serum antibodies against the infecting 
organism; a 10 fold rise has been detected in some cases. </p>
<p>The organisms can be readily detected in patient specimens by  modified Kinyoun stain as used for Cryptosporidium sp, or by auto fluorescence under UV illumination . </p>
<p>Treatment recently recommended for the disease is a seven day course of oral co-trimoxazole which has been found to eliminate symptoms and shedding. </p>
<p>Epidemiology of <i>Cyclospora</i> infections is interesting and still unraveling before our eyes. The organisms of this genus have been isolated from reptiles, moles, rodents and recently, chimpanzees.  </p>
<p><i>Cyclospora sp</i> was implicated in a variety of sporadic and epidemic diarrheal illnesses in Nepal, Peru, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Morocco and other countries of North, Central and South America, Eastern Europe and Asia, including Indonesia, India, Pakistan and Cambodia. Most of these infections were linked to travel or residence in developing countries; others were acquired locally in temperate climates and developed countries (the Chicago outbreak and a sporadic case from the United Kingdom). </p>
<p>Overall prevalence varies from region to region. In Nepal it ranged from 10-20% in individuals with diarrhea to 1% in asymptomatic populations. Prevalence in Lima, Peru was 6-18%  while a US lab-based study estimated it as approximately  0.2%. The disease displays a seasonal pattern with peaks during hot and humid months. </p>
<p>The route of transmission is most probably via contaminated water. One reported case linked the disease to an accidental ingestion of water from an aquarium  The Chicago outbreak involving a hospital dormitory and several physicians was linked to a failure of the dormitory water pump. </p>
<p>cluster of cases reported in foreign residents and tourists in Katmandu, Nepal was 
epidemiologically linked to the drinking of contaminated water or milk diluted with such water. <i>Cyclospora sp</i> was isolated from tap water and a head of lettuce found in households of patients diagnosed with <i>Cyclospora</i> diarrhea. </p>
<p>Several outbreaks have recently been reported from  Florida, New York and Boston as well as 
Texas and southern Ontario. Recently, an epidemiological link to the consumption of fresh or processed strawberries has been postulated; to date there is no firm laboratory evidence to substantiate transmission other than the one already established previously - through water as a vehicle. Interestingly, in Katmandu cluster only 28% of infected patients reported drinking untreated or water milk in one study and so, additional, yet unidentified modes of transmission have to be considered. </p>
<p>In terms of overall prevalence, a study from Lima, Peru demonstrated that only 11-28% of children excreting <i>Cyclospora sp</i> in their stools presented with diarrhea. This can be considered by some as evidence for the lack of pathogenicity. However, a similar situation was noted for <i>Cryptosporidium sp</i> in a study from India, and asymptomatic carriage of recognized pathogens such as <i>Giardia</i> and <i>E. histolytica</i>  is well recognized. </p>
<p>Although still rare, <i>Cyclospora cayetanensis</i>  should be considered in the differential diagnosis of diarrheal diseases in returning travelers. As we now know, its geographical distribution does in fact include Canada. Physicians and laboratories across the country should be aware of its  existence and pathogenic potential. </p>
