<h3> Abstract </h3>
</center>



Motivation: Gene annotation is the final goal of gene prediction
algorithms. However, these algorithms frequently make mistakes
and therefore the use of gene predictions for sequence
annotation is hardly possible. As a result, biologists are forced to
conduct time-consuming gene identification experiments by
designing appropriate PCR primers to test cDNA libraries or
applying RT-PCR, exon trapping/amplification, or other
techniques. This process frequently amounts to `guessing' PCR
primers on top of unreliable gene predictions and frequently
leads to wasting of experimental efforts. 

<p>
Results: The present paper proposes a simple and reliable
algorithm for experimental gene identification which bypasses
the unreliable gene prediction step. Studies of the performance
of the algorithm on a sample of human genes indicate that an
experimental protocol based on the algorithm's predictions
achieves an accurate gene identification with relatively few PCR
primers. Predictions of PCR primers may be used for exon
amplification in preliminary mutation analysis during an attempt to
identify a gene responsible for a disease. We propose a simple
approach to find a short region from a genomic sequence that
with high probability overlaps with some exon of the gene. The
algorithm is enhanced to find one or more segments that are
probably contained in the translated region of the gene and can
be used as PCR primers to select appropriate clones in cDNA
libraries by selective amplification. The algorithm is further
extended to locate a set of PCR primers that uniformly cover all
translated regions and can be used for RT-PCR and further
sequencing of (unknown) mRNA.
