MEETING PROGRAM
</H1>
<EM> Time is left between talks for discussion </EM>
<H1> Friday, March 3 </H1>
<H2>  Morning session: Room 26-414 (The Kolker Room)</H2>

<DT> 8:30-9:00: Continental Breakfast
<P>
<DT> 9:00-9:30: Edmund Bertschinger
<DD> <EM> Results from the MAC: Supercomputing Allocations. </EM>
<DT> 9:35-10:05: Roskies, Norman, Bertschinger
<DD> <EM> The Present and Future of the Metacenter. </EM>
<DT> 10:15-10:25: Edmund Bertschinger
<DD> <EM> Software Archive Release Status. </EM>
<DT> 10:25-10.40: Greg Bryan
<DD> <EM> The GC3 Software and Data Archive. </EM> <BR>
       The GC3 software and data archive is ready for use.  It provides
       an easy and secure way for the consortium to distribute and 
       disseminate its codes and data
       to the community as a whole (something we promised to do in our
       proposal).  I will talk about how easy it all is and how
       we can distribute codes to the GC3 group (only) or to the whole world.
<P>
<DT> 10:40-11:00: Coffee Break
<P>

<DT> 11:00-11:15: Discussion
<DD> <EM>  Archive Issues.</EM>

<DT> 11:10-11:50: Renyue Cen
<DD> <EM>  
Correlations of the Cosmic X-ray Background: A Non-cluster Hot Gas Model. 
</EM> <BR>
      Assuming that the hot gas produced during the phase of
      cosmic structure collapse, which does not reside in the great
      clusters of galaxies, is responsible for the residual X-ray background
      field, we find that the spectral properties and statistical properties
      are in accord with observations.

<DT> 12:00-1:15: Lunch
<P>

<H2> Afternoon session: Room 2-105 </H2>

<DT> 1:15-1:35: David Spergel
<DD> <EM>  Future CMBR Experiments.  </EM>  <BR>
      Future CMBR experiments and their implications for the study of
      large scale structure will be discussed.
<DT> 1:45-2:05: Uros Seljak
<DD> <EM>  Summary of ITP CMB Workshop.  </EM> 
<DT> 2:15-2:35: Paul Bode
<DD> <EM>  Calculations of CMB Anisotropies. </EM>  <BR>
      The LINGER code (soon to be released on the software archive)
      integrates the coupled, linearized, Einstein, Boltzmann, and fluid
      equations governing the evolution of scalar metric perturbations
      and photons (both polarizations), neutrinos 
      (both massless and, optionally, massive), baryons,
      and cold dark matter in a perturbed flat Robertson-Walker universe.
      I have been running a parallel version on the SP2, and will
      present the resulting CMB anisotropies for a wide range of models.
</DD>
<P>
<DT> 2:45-3:00: Coffee Break
<P>

<H3>
3:00 - 4:50: Open Talks 
</H3>
Mike Norman:
<EM> 
What Sets the Core Radius of X-ray Clusters? 
</EM> <BR>
	I describe a systematic convergence study of simulations
	of the evolution of a single luminous x-ray cluster in a
	cosmological background in an attempt to converge on its
	global properties: luminosity, emission weighted temperature,
	core radius, beta, etc.

Lars Hernquist:
<EM> 
What are Compact Groups?
</EM> <BR>
     The physical nature of compact groups (CGs) of galaxies is
     discussed.  Conventionally, CGs are interpreted to be bound
     systems or transient members of more diffuse groups.  Another
     possibility recently proposed is that CGs are chance projections
     of filamentary galaxy distributions.  This latter suggestion is
     discussed at length and observational tests are proposed that
     could discriminate between the competing models. <P>

<DT> 5:00-6:00:  Visit to holography exhibit at MIT Museum.

<H2> Afternoon session: Room 2-105 </H2>
<DT> 1:30-1:50: Chung-Pei Ma
<DD> <EM> Mixed Dark Matter Models.  </EM> <BR>
      I will summarize both the high and low redshift constraints on the
      neutrino mass from our simulations of the mixed dark matter
      models.  I will also discuss new fitting formulas for the cold and hot
      power spectra for a wide range of wavenumber, expansion factor, and
      neutrino mass density.
<DT> 2:00-2:30: Ue-Li Pen
<DD> <EM> The Cosmological Adaptive Moving Mesh </EM> <BR>
      We have completed the implementation of the curvilinear cosmological
      hydrodynamics code.  We will present the performance and test properties
      of the code, in comparison to exact solutions as well as compared
      to other existing codes.
<DT> 2:40-3:00: Shelby Yang
<DD> <EM> pC++ Codes on New Machines.  </EM> <BR>
      The talk will focus on recent porting of the
      SCF and PM code to Power Challenge, SP2, and T3D.  Benchmark
      results will be shown.
