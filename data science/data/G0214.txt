<H1>FIRAS Data Products </H1>

<P>
<HR><I>The Data Products described here are from Pass 4 of the FIRAS Processing
Pipeline. They supersede all data products released prior to 01-Jan-1998.
</I> </P>

<P><I>A <A HREF="firas_products_table.gif"> table summarizing the Pass
4 FIRAS data products</A> can be viewed on your screen (it's a gif image).
Postscript and LaTeX versions of the table are available by ftp in the
<A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/firas/doc">
spacecraft_data/cobe/firas/doc</A>
directory. Anonymous ftp instructions are given below. </I> </P>

<H2>Introduction </H2>

<P>The FIRAS Project Data Sets and Analyzed Science Data Sets (ASDS) cover
the whole sky and provide spectrophotometric data at frequencies ranging
from 1 to 97 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> (30 to 2910 GHz). The main celestial emission
components in this interval are the cosmic microwave background, the spectrum
of which FIRAS was designed to measure precisely, thermal emission from
interstellar dust, and line emission from various molecules, atoms, and
ions, including the CO rotational ladder (from J=1-0 to J=6-5), the C<SUP>+</SUP>
158 micron line, and other important interstellar cooling lines. </P>

<P>The FIRAS instrument, its operating modes, calibration, and the data
products are described in detail in the <A HREF="firas_exsupv4.html"> FIRAS
Explanatory Supplement</A>. Briefly, the FIRAS is a scanning, four-port
(two input; two output) Michelson interferometer that uses polarizing grids
as beamsplitters and creates an interferogram (<I>i.e.,</I> the Fourier
transform of the source spectrum) by scanning a movable mirror platform
(the &quot;mirror transport mechanism,&quot; or MTM). A dichroic splitter
at each output port (arbitrarily designated &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;)
further splits each beam into low (2 - 20 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>) and high (20
- 100 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>) frequency bands. The four detectors are thus referred
to as RH, RL, LH, and LL, for &quot;right high,&quot; etc. The MTM can
be scanned at either of two speeds: &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;fast&quot;.
And the MTM sweep can be set to one of two scan lengths, &quot;long&quot;
or &quot;short,&quot; thus affecting the spectral resolution. Files that
provide data collected in the right, high, short, slow mode, for example,
have &quot;RHSS&quot; in their names (<I>e.g.,</I> FIRAS_CALIBRATED_SKY_SPECTRA_RHSS.FITS).
</P>

</UL>

<P>These and the other FIRAS data products are briefly described below.
</P>

<P>The FIRAS sky maps are <A HREF="skymap_info.html"> quadrilateralized
spherical cube projections in ecliptic coordinates</A>. presented in FITS
binary tables. Each cube face covers 4pi/6 sr in 32 x 32 pixels of approximately
equal area; the area is equivalent to a square 2.59 deg on a side. The
FIRAS horn has a 7 degree circular top hat power pattern, and motional
smearing adds 2.3 degrees to the effective beam in a direction perpendicular
to the ecliptic plane. </P>

<P><A HREF="http://space.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/cobe/cgis.html">Software specifically
designed to ingest and analyze COBE data</A> may be obtained via anonymous
ftp. You may also wish to take advantage of the <A HREF="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html">
FITSIO</A> FORTRAN subroutine library developed by W. Pence. </P>

<H2>How to Obtain the Products </H2>

<P>All of the data products described below may be obtained from the <A HREF="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/">
NSSDC</A>. </P>

<P>The most popular products are kept on line and may be downloaded from
the <A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/firas">
 FIRAS subdirectories</A>
of the NSSDC's COBE data server. <B>Note that problems occasionally arise
when the files are downloaded over the Web (i.e., http server). If you
have trouble using a FIRAS FITS file, please use ftp to download the file.</B>
An ftp session should go something like this: </P>

<PRE>    % ftp nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov      # type this command
      ...                             #  <ftp responds>
    Name: anonymous                   # type &quot;anonymous&quot;
    Password:                         # type your e-mail address
    ftp&gt; cd spacecraft_data/cobe      # change to cobe directory
    ftp&gt; cd firas                     # change to sub-directory
    ftp&gt; cd dust_map                  # change to sub-directory
    ftp&gt; ls                           # list files
    ftp&gt; bin                          # switch to binary mode
    ftp&gt; mget *DUST*                  # retrieve some Spectral Sky Maps
    ftp&gt; quit                         # end session
</PRE>

<P>The entire set of FIRAS data products (except the Time-ordered Data)
will soon be made available on a FIRAS CD-ROM. </P>

<H2><A NAME="linemaps"></A>Line Emission Maps</H2>

<P>The Line Emission Maps cover the entire sky and give the intensity and
the associated uncertainty in each of 18 emission lines, of which the following
9 were detected (Bennett <I>et al.</I> 1994; included as Appendix D of
the <A HREF="firas_exsupv4.html"> FIRAS Explanatory Supplement</A>): the
158 micron ground state transition of C<SUP>+</SUP>, an important neutral
interstellar gas coolant; the N<SUP>+</SUP> 122 micron and 205 micron transitions,
which trace extended low-density ionized gas; the 370 micron and 609 micron
lines of neutral carbon, which arise in photodissociation regions; and
the CO J=2-1, 3-2, 4-3, and 5-4 lines, which trace the molecular gas. As
one would expect, the line emission is strongest in the Galactic plane
and concentrated in the inner Galaxy. </P>

<P>There are three Line Emission Map FITS files. Two of these are at low
spectral resolution: FIRAS_LINE_EMISSION_MAP_LOWF.FITS covers frequencies
&lt; 630 GHz; FIRAS_LINE_EMISSION_MAP_HIGH.FITS covers higher frequencies
and also includes the parameters of an interstellar dust model (see below).
FIRAS_LINE_EMISSION_MAP_HRES.FITS contains high spectral resolution data
from 30 to 660 GHz. </P>

<P><B>Synthetic spectral line profiles</B> (FIRAS_LINE_PROFILES_*.FITS)
are provided for each of the channel and scan modes or merged modes. The
synthetic profiles can be used in conjunction with a <A HREF="#spectral">FIRAS
spectrum</A> to calculate line intensities. </P>

here </A>. </P>

<H2><A NAME="dustmaps"></A>Galactic Dust Continuum Spectra and Interstellar
Dust Parameters </H2>

<P>The two dust spectrum maps (FIRAS_DUST_SPECTRUM_HIGH.FITS and FIRAS_DUST_SPECTRUM_LOWF.FITS)
cover the whole sky and give the residual sky spectrum after modelled emission
from the CMBR, interplanetary dust (zodiacal emission), and interstellar
lines have been subtracted. The remaining signal is dominated by thermal
continuum emission from Galactic interstellar dust. </P>

<P>Maps of the interstellar dust temperature and the 167 micron (1800 GHz)
optical depth are included in the high-frequency Line Emission Map file.
A single-temperature dust model was used to make these maps and the far-infrared
dust emissivity was assumed to have a power law spectral index of 2.0.
Different models can be used and assumptions made, and corresponding temperature
and optical depth maps can be derived straightforwardly from the Dust Spectrum
Maps. Reach <I>et al.</I> (<A HREF="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1995ApJ...451..188R">
1995, ApJ, 451, 188</A>), for example, report evidence for a ubiquitous
cold (~5 K) dust component. </P>

<H2><A NAME="cmbmap"></A>CMB Temperature Map</H2>

<P>A file called FIRAS_TEMPERATURE_MAP_LOWF.FITS contains maps of the CMB
temperature and its uncertainty, parameters of a dipole fit to the CMB
temperature map (amplitude, direction, and associated uncertainties), and
the average CMB temperature measured by FIRAS (2.728 +/- 0.004 K). </P>

</P>

<H2><A NAME="spectral"></A>Spectral Sky Maps, Interferograms, and Ancillary
Data</H2>

<P>The high-level data products described above derive from FIRAS spectra
and ultimately from the original interferograms. Calibrated spectra, interferograms
and various ancillary products were released as FIRAS Project Data Sets.
</P>

<P>There are three main Spectral Sky Maps: two low-spectral resolution
products (FIRAS_DESTRIPED_SKY_SPECTRA_LOWF.FITS, and FIRAS_DESTRIPED_SKY_SPECTRA_HIGH.FITS,
which cover the full FIRAS frequency range at ~25 GHz resolution; and a
high-spectral resolution product called FIRAS_DESTRIPED_SKY_SPECTRA_HRES.FITS,
which covers the frequency range 30 - 660 GHz at 6.9 GHz resolution. These
files contain a spectrum at each pixel and were created by coadding spectra
obtained from various FIRAS channel and scan mode combinations. Prior to
coaddition, the observations made in different modes were calibrated to
remove the instrument signature. &quot;Destriping&quot; is a secondary
calibration step applied to compensate for unidentified instrumental offsets.
The existence of such offsets is suggested by stripes that appear in an
untreated sky map at a particular frequency. </P>

here</A>.</P>

<P>In addition to the spectral maps mentioned above, Spectral Sky Maps
representing data from individual instrument modes and various intermediate
mode combinations are also available for analysis. You may wish to compare
corresponding spectra from these files to gauge their consistency. For
a description of how the data were processed, a discussion of the random
and systematic errors, and advice on how to use the ancillary data products,
see the <A HREF="firas_exsupv4.html"> FIRAS Explanatory Supplement</A>.
