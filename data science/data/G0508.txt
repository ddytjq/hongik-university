Does our universe go on forever, or is there an end?<P>

<B>
Dear Duncan,<BR>

the destiny of our universe is regulated by the amount of matter and energy,
therefore the amount of self-gravity, that it contains.<P>

The higher the content of mass and energy, the larger the
self-gravity. Exactly like a more massive planets, e.g. Jupiter, has more
gravity than less massive planets, like the Earth.<P>

If the self-gravity of the universe is enough to stop the expansion, the
universe will eventually come to a rest and recollapse (Big Crunch). <P>

If the self-gravity is not enough to stop the cosmic expansion (or if it needs
an infinite amount of time to do it) the universe will expand forever.<P>

Present measure on the amount of mass and energy of the universe are highly
uncertain. Some data seem to suggest that there in not enough self-gravity.
Other data might dispute these findings. We need to keep studying this
matter.<P>

Take care,<BR>

I am a little confused at something here. I was taught that quasars are
at the rim of the universe, traveling there at tremendous speeds. How
can we view them if they should be the oldest remnants of our universe
when we can also view the oldest remnants of our universe vis a vis the
recent HST deep sky research that shows ancient galaxies forming. Or to
put it another way, how can we view two totally different sets of objects,
that to me come from the same period in time and space and yet exist in
vastly different points in space?<P>

Thanks in advance<P>


<b>
Dear Chris,<br>

While it is true that quasars can be observed at very remote cosmic distances
because they are very bright, not all quasars are so distant. In fact, there
is a fairly large number of relatively nearby quasars.<P>

It is a recent news, actually, that the most distant object known is not
anymore a quasar, but a galaxy at redshift z=4.9 discovered thanks to the
magnifying gravitational lens of a massive cluster of galaxies in the
foreground. <P>

We can see objects at different distances. But we see them at a different age,
because the speed of light is finite. In other words, the light from a
relatively nearby object took only a modest amount of time to travel from it
to us, thus we see that object as it was when the light left it (so, only a
modest amount of time ago).<P>

The light from a very distant object, on the other hand, took a much longer
time to travel through the cosmos and reach us. Thus, the information that it is
bringing to us is the one when it left the object, namely many billion years
ago, when the object was young.<P>

Hope this will clarify the picture.<P>

Thanks for writing and take care!!<br>

Your broadcast last night provided some staggering statistics regarding
the immensity of the universe.  However, I wondered if there is any way
that astronomers can determine where the Milky Way sits within the
universe.  Does the universe have a center?  If its constantly
expanding, can I asume that we wouldn't be located toward the outer
limits, because it may be too new?  Can we use conventional shapes to
even describe the universe?  Great show.  I'm looking forward to
watching again next week.  Thanks.<P>


<B>
Dear Neil,<BR>

No, the universe does not have a center from which originates. The expansion
started everywhere at the same time. For a 2-dimensional analogous case,
imagine a membrane of cellophane that is being stretched from every direction
without breaking, indefinitely. Imagine that this membreane is very, very
large, actually infinite. How can you tell that there is a center? Every
point is receiding from every other point, and no center can be defined. <P>

That should give you an idea in 2-dimension. It requires a little bit more of
geometrical imagination to figure out what happens in 3 dimensions, but it
is qualitatively similar.<P>

So, we cannot place where the Milky Way is in the universe...<P>

Thanks for writing us.<P>

Take care,<BR>

Tom Tillander <BR>
Cleveland Ohio<P>

Two pieces of information that i absorbed from Mondays
program are:<BR>

1. The the light that was imaged by the deep space team
has been traveling toward us for 14 billion years.<P>

2.  The team believes that the universe is 15 billion years
old.<P>

One piece of information I didn't catch was the relative speed of
separation between us and those galaxies.  For the sake of this
question I will assume it is .5C<P>

Given that assumption, in the 14 billion years since the light left
those deep space galaxies we could have only increased our separation
from them by 7 billion light years.  That means that at the time the
light left those galaxies we were already 7 billion light years away.<P>

If the big bang occurred at a point.  How did we separate that initial 7
billion light years in only 1 billion years?<P>

I suppose my real question is where is the flaw in my thinking?<P>
Thanks<P>


<B>Dear Tom,<BR>

14 billion years ago the galaxies were all physically closer to each other by
an amount that it is, more or less, equal to the rate of expansion (whose
exact value is still uncertain and will require more measures to be done)
times the time that they have been expanding, namely 12 billion years.<P>

The redshift that we see from distant galaxies is caused by their recession
velocity. However, bear in mind that this velocity is not a physical one in
the sense we are used to. It is actually entirely due to the expansion of the
space and not to a physical motion (well, there are also physical motions,
the so called "peculiar velocity", but they contribute only a minor amount to
the observed redshifts).<P>

The "cosmological redshifts" are cause by the "dilatation" of the space
between two galaxies (a consequence of the cosmological expansion). Thus, the
velocity involved are very high, larger than the speed of light if you
compute them using the traditional doppler formula. However, this does not
violete general relativiy, because the motions, as I said before, are not
physical motions but due to the cosmic expansion.<P>

Thus, the flaw in your reasoning was to assume a speed of 0.5c. But actually
the galaxies were not moving in a physical sense. It was the space between
them that expanded a lot. This is the expansion that causes the redshift, not
a proper motion in the space. And this expansion was very very large in the
past, much larger than 0.5c. Still, no contraddiction with General Relativity
which dictates that only physical motions have to be smaller than c.<P>

Hope this clarifies things a little.<P>

Take care and have fun with the program.<BR>

Gerald Lame <BR>
Palm Springs, California<P>

One of the astronomers on the first program indicated that,
although the distance we can see into the universe is
limited by the amount of time light has had to reach us
since the big bang, the universe in fact extends beyond
this limit, which I think he called our "event horizon".
But how did anything have enough time to travel that far
since the big bang?<P>

If everything started at the same place, at the time
of the big bang, and no object can travel relative to
another faster than the speed of light, how could any object
have time enough to travel away from us more light years
than the age of the universe?<P>

<B>
Dear Gerald,<BR>

Your confusion originates from the fact that you imagine the Big Bang
originating from one point in space. But in fact the Big Bang took place
everywhere at the same time, with no center in it. <P>

You can have a 2-dimensional equivalent if you imagine a cellophane membrane
that is being stretched from every direction in a homogeneous way. Imagine
that the membrane will keep extending without breaking. Imagine now that the
membrane is very, very, very large. Actually, infinite. Where is the center?
There is no center there, right? Every two point keep expanding from each
other as far as the membrane is being stretched and there is no need to even
think of a center.<P>

Now imagine a point on this membrane that is shining light. In a given time,
only points close enough that the light had time to reach will see the
beacon. The other points will have to wait a little bit longer, until the
light hits them. But they are there, just out of reach of the shining one. <P>

This is a good examply, albeit in 2-dimensions only (it takes a lot of
abstraction to figure out things in 3 dimensions in this case), of the
universe.<P>

In summary, the expansion of the universe, which is not a physical motion but
only a dilatation of the space, was faster than the speed of light, with no
violation of General Relativity, which prescribes that only physical motions
cannot be fater than the light. The expansion of the space is not contrained
by that law. Because the expansion was faster than the light (at the very
instant of the Big Bang it was actually infinite) there are points in the
universe that light did not have yet the time to place in causal relation
(namely, to illuminate). It will do so, though, in due course!<P>

Thanks for asking and take care!<BR>
