<p>This chapter of the user guide discusses what important things to
note about the Runtime Environment in DJGPP.  <strong>Most problems
occur because people fail to realize that DJGPP is running in 32-bit
mode under DPMI - you do not have as much control over the computer as
you would in 16-bit mode.</strong></p>

<p> If you have any comments, suggestions, or questions, feel free to
contact the author of this section, Tom St Denis, via email: <a
href="mailto:tomstdenis@goplay.com">tomstdenis@goplay.com</a></p>

<h2>Default Operand Size</h2>

<p>The default operand size is the size of the standard unit for
arithmetic.  The size changes depending on what compiler you use.  The
only reason that this effects anyone of us, is that the standard unit
is also the same size as an <tt>int</tt>, which is 4-bytes (32-bit).
This causes problems when you write programs for 16-bit DOS (where an
<tt>int</tt> is 16-bit) and expect an <tt>int</tt> to take 2 bytes.
For example, using the <tt>sizeof</tt> operator.  Although if you
write ANSI-C compatible code this should not affect you.  Yet, if you
use <em>inline asm</em> or you access hardware ports, you may want to
read this.  In a 16-bit C Compiler, <tt>int</tt>'s are <strong>16 bits
(2 bytes)</strong> in size, because it's faster.  Same thing for
DJGPP, <strong>32-bit <tt>int</tt>s are faster to use than 16-bit
<tt>int</tt>s</strong>.  It's not hard to use 16-bit integers in
DJGPP.  You just use the <tt>short</tt> keyword.  Just make sure that
if you are trying to use a 16-bit number use <tt>short</tt> as this is
16 bits in DJGPP and most popular 16-bit C compilers. </p>

<h2>Default Pointer Size</h2>

<p>This is about the same as the first topic.  Just like <tt>int</tt>
you must note that <em>pointers are 32-bits in size</em>, in DJGPP.
In most 16-bit C compilers there are 32-bit pointers, but these
consist of a segment and an offset.  In DJGPP addresses are
<em>linear</em>, meaning that the 32-bit pointer (like <tt>char
*</tt>) is <em>just an offset</em>.  Unlike the <tt>int</tt> scenario,
there is no standard way of making a 16-bit pointer.  So when using
inline assembler, make sure you accept a 32-bit pointer. </p>

<h2>Data Types, summary.</h2>

<p>This section sums up the previous two, in a condensed format.
Unlike 16-bit C compilers, <strong><tt>int</tt>'s are
32-bit</strong>, so make sure that you realize this.  The safest way
to avoid any problems with <tt>int</tt>'s between 32-bit and 16-bit
systems, is to <strong>use the <tt>sizeof</tt></strong> operator,
instead of assuming the size of the data type.  Also do not rely on
<em>inline assembly</em> if you are trying to write portable code
(between 16 and 32-bit systems).  Also just like the <tt>int</tt>'s,
<em>pointers are 32-bit too</em>.  For example: </p>

<pre>
void
test(int *a, int *b, int amnt)
{
  memcpy(a, b,  amnt * 2);
}
</pre>

This function copies all the ints in <tt>a</tt> to <tt>b</tt>.  Can
you see the problem in this function?  Here look at this: </p>

<pre>
void
test(int *a, int *b, int amnt)
{
  memcpy(a, b, amnt * sizeof(int));
}
</pre>

<p>Notice the difference?  Well the first example will not work
correctly in DJGPP.  That is just one example of how making
assumptions can hurt you.  </p>

<h2>Bye Bye, Borland<tt> :)</tt></h2>

<p> This section covers the favourite functions in borland that do not
work in DJGPP.  The first function I wish to talk about is
<tt>coreleft()</tt>.  In Borland C++, the <tt>coreleft()</tt> returns
the amount of available heap.  This functions is useful because it
allows you to see how much ram is available without just running out.
However in a DPMI situation where you have dynamic virtual RAM, the
heap is not static as you may use virtual ram upon request.  You can
check how much RAM is available though.  Take a look at this example:
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;alloc.h&gt;

void
main(void)
{
  printf("Heap size: %lu \n", (unsigned long) coreleft());
}
</pre>

<p>This displays how much available heap you have.  Now you can do
something similar in DJGPP too.  You use DPMI function 0x0500
to retrieve DPMI memory information, for example: </p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;dpmi.h&gt;

int
main(void)
{
  __dpmi_free_mem_info dpmi_free_mem;

  __dpmi_get_free_memory_information(&dpmi_free_mem);

  printf("Heap: %i\n", dpmi_free_mem.largest_available_free_block_in_bytes);

  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>In this example, it displays all the available RAM, <em>including
virtual RAM.</em> Next is interrupt support.  I will not provide an
example here but just to let you know that the
<tt>getvect()/setvect()</tt> functions (<tt>dos.h</tt>) in Borland C++ do not
work the same way in DJGPP.  If you use interrupts in your program
check out the chapter on interrupts for more information.</p>

<p> There are other Borland specific things that do not work in DJGPP
(such as the <tt>far</tt> keyword, <tt>farcalloc</tt>,
<tt>farmalloc</tt>, etc...) but this is more a subject for porting
16-bit applications to DJGPP.</p>

<h2>The 32-bit Wonder Years</h2>

<blockquote><i>Not to long ago, 16-bit compilers ruled the earth.  They
were considered gods, but soon programmers were feeling tormented, so
the gods, grew and became what we call 32-bit compilers.  Now they
told us stories of great wonders, and pleasures.  And that there was.
However there were some sacrifices to be made to the gods.  One day
one of the gods killed his brothers RAW, XMS and VCPI leaving him
(DPMI :) ) to rule the 32-bit world.</i></blockquote>

<p> OK, interesting way to put that.  This section covers little
things you should know about writing 32-bit programs with DPMI.
First, the most import thing that people like to note: DJGPP is
32-bit.  Meaning you get more RAM, more space, just plain more.  This
does however cause confusion.  In DJGPP, addresses are always 32 bits,
but there are no segments (Actually there <em>are</em> still segments,
but they normally are not directly referred to in DJGPP, and not
portable to all compilers).  This means that the addresses only have
an <em>offset</em> to them, this is what we call <em>Linear
Addressing</em>.  You should note this when porting <em>FAR Data
Model</em> programs to DJGPP, because they use segment/offset pair
addressing.  Now you don't get all the RAM for free though.  If you
run out of RAM, you can still use more memory (huh?), this is called
<em>virtual memory</em>.  There is one sacrifice you must make though
(drum roll...), performance! <em>Swapping</em> is what they call it
when disk space is substituted for RAM.  This allows you to load
bigger programs, but slower.  </p>

<p> Now when you load a program into 32-bit mode, you must have a way
to control the program to make sure it doesn't crash on you.  So a
special program was created to load the programs, it is called a
<em>DPMI Server</em>.  DPMI stands for <em>Dos Protected Mode
Interface</em>, and is covered in the DPMI chapter of the User's
Guide.  I would just like to let you know that DPMI controls how the
program works, accesses ram, and other specialties.  Here is a list of
some things DPMI provides: </p>

<ul>
  <li> Access to DOS RAM
  <li> selector, descriptor functions
  <li> FPU Emulation control
  <li> Debugging Support
  <li> Calling real mode interrupts 
  <li> Setting/Getting Real/Protected Mode Interrupts
  <li> Setting/Getting Exception Handlers 
  <li> Virtual Ram 
  <li> Get/Free 32-bit ram (above 1MB) 
  <li> Crash Protection 
</ul>

<p>Included in the standard DJGPP C library are all theses functions.
DJGPP's runtime environment is based upon DPMI functions.  You should
only worry about DPMI limitations and functions if your code is not
100% Ansi-C compliant.</p>
