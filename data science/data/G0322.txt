<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>When and where does the Sun first rise at the beginning of the
next millennium?

<p>Questions about the times of <a href="./faq/docs/RST_defs.html">sunrise
and sunset</a> can usually be answered without reference to a specific
year, since the Sun's position in the sky is almost the same from year to year
on any given date.   For places at low to middle latitudes, a sunrise/sunset
table computed for some specific year can be used in any year.  However, at
polar latitudes the differences are magnified and, for such places, a
sunrise/sunset table for one year may differ from the table for another year by
many minutes.  So although the basic Earth-Sun geometry on any given date
is pretty much the same from year to year, we must be careful when we have to
consider places in the arctic or antarctic.  Some people say the millennium
begins on the first day of the year 2000 and others say it begins on the first
day of 2001 (see <a href="./faq/docs/millennium.html">"The 21st Century and the 3rd
Millennium"</a>).  The answer to the "first sunrise" question is <i>almost</i>
the same for both years.  It depends to some extent on the exact question you
are asking.

<p>It is also important to realize that on any January 1, the Sun is
continuously above the horizon across most of Antarctica.  Therefore, if the
question is really, "Where will the Sun first be seen after the beginning of
the new millennium?", the answer is simple: Antarctica.

<p>However, if you are really interested in the first sunrise, the question
becomes more involved.  <b>The fundamental issue is when you think a new
day, or a new year, begins.</b>  Does it begin at local midnight, in the time
zone defined by the local jurisdiction?   Or does it begin at midnight on the
meridian of Greenwich, England (the zero longitude meridian), that is,
0&nbsp;hours Greenwich Mean Time?  Astronomers refer to the latter instant
as 0&nbsp;hours <a href="./faq/docs/UT.html">Universal
Time</a> (0h UT) and that is the usage here.

<p>The Washington Prime Meridian Conference of 1884, which established the
Greenwich Meridian as the prime meridian, did not settle this matter.  The final resolution states:
<blockquote>
  <i>That the Conference proposes the adoption of a universal day for all
  purposes for which it may be convenient, and which shall not interfere
  with the use of local or other standard time where desirable.</i>
</blockquote>
Thus the two conflicting definitions are enshrined in international law.

<p>In the following, we define <i>local time</i> as the time zone (civil
time) established by the local governing authority, except in
Antarctica.  In Antarctica (and the surrounding waters), local time, as
used here, is the time zone defined by the nearest meridian of longitude
that is an integer multiple of 15&#176.


<a name="0hr"></a>
<h3>2. Where is the line of sunrise at 0h UT on January 1?</h3>

<p>At 0 hours UT the Sun is rising along a line that runs from about 650 km
east of Kerguelen Island in the Indian Ocean to about 640 km east of Amsterdam
Island, through the Nicobar Islands, up along the Burma-Thailand border, through China,  along the China-Outer Mongolia border, along the China-Russia
border, through Siberia and out into the Arctic Ocean just north of the
Poluostrov peninsula.  All places along this line will experience sunrise
simultaneously at 0 hours UT on 2000 or 2001.  There is no unique "first
sunrise" location.

<p><img src="./graphics/world2001.gif">

<p><font size="-1">The position of the terminator, the boundary between
day and night, at 0 hours UT on January 1.  Along the part of the
terminator west of the prime meridian (the meridian of longitude that
passes through Greenwich, England) the Sun is setting, and along the part
of the terminator to the east of the prime meridian the Sun is rising.
The lightly shaded area is in civil twilight, where the Sun is below the
horizon but there is still sufficient light scattered by the
atmosphere that it is not completely dark.  At this time the Earth is tilted
so that the north pole is away from the Sun and is continually in darkness
and the south pole, along with most of the continent of Antarctica, is
continually in daylight.  Image from <a

<h3>3. What is the first place where the Sun rises on January 1,
local time?</h3>

<p>The first place where the Sun will rise in the new millennium, local
time, will be on the <a href="./faq/docs/international_date.html">
International Date Line</a>, all of which is in the Pacific Ocean.  Even
though the line makes some zigzags to the east, the place on the line where
the Sun will rise first is far south, near the Antarctic Circle, where the
line is intersected by the terminator (day/night line).   Here, the Sun dips
just below the horizon and then rises again almost immediately at midnight
local time.  The longitude is 180&#176 E exactly, and we take the local time
to be 12 hours ahead of UT.  The southern limit to the terminator is at
latitude 66&#176 3' S on January 1, 2000 and 66&#176 7' S on January 1, 2001.
Both of these locations are in the extreme southern part of the Pacific Ocean
with no land nearby.


<a name="ant"></a>
<h3>4. What is the first point of land where the Sun rises on
January 1, local time?</h3>

<p>Once the angular size of the Sun and the effect of mean atmospheric
refraction are accounted for, the farthest south the Sun can rise on January 1,
2000 is at latitude 66&#176 3' S.  Farther south the Sun is continuously
above the horizon.  The first place in Antarctica west of the <a
href="./faq/docs/international_date.html">International Date Line</a>
where the Sun can rise on January 1, 2000 is on the headland between the
Dibble Glacier (134&#176 37' E) and Victor Bay.  At 135&#176 53' the Sun rises
at 12:08 AM, 15:08 (12/31) UT.  In 2001, because the terminator is farther
south at 66&#176 7' S, the point on the coast where the Sun will first rise is
at 135&#176 49'. On January 1, 2001 the Sun will rise there at 12:05 AM, 15:05
(12/31) UT, just ten minutes after sunset.  However, the Sun may have risen at
around 12:23 AM, 13:23 (12/31) UT on the northern tip of Young Island
(162&#176 17' E) in the Balleny Islands.  Young Island extends to 66&#176 13'
S, so under unusual atmospheric conditions, the Sun may be seen to set there
on Dec. 31, 2000.  The chances of having a sunset at Young Island are only
15%.  On Dec. 31, 1999, the chances of the Sun setting are only 7%.

<p>The sunrise times and places assume normal values of refraction.  For
information on the effects of refraction see:&nbsp; <a
href="./faq/docs/first_sunrise.html#refraction">How much does refraction
affect the time of sunrise?</a>  If you are worried about not seeing the
sunrise because of refraction effects, the place to be assured of seeing the
sunrise is at the northern tip of the Dibble Glacier (66&#176 0' &#177 1' S,
134&#176 37' &#177 2' E) where the Sun will rise at 12:22 AM, 15:22 (12/31)
UT, on January 1, 2000 and at 12:29 AM, 15:29 (12/31) UT on January 1, 2001.


<a name="inhab"></a>
<h3>5. What is the first permanently inhabited place where the
Sun rises on January 1, local time?</h3>

<p>The first <i>populated</i> land where the Sun will rise in the new
millennium (and at the beginning of any other year) is at Kahuitara Point
(44&#176 16' S 176&#176 9' W) on Pitt Island in the Chatham Islands, a
dependency of New Zealand.  The Sun will rise there at 16:04 (12/31) UT or
4:49 AM local time.

<a name="kiri"></a>
<h3>6. What about Kiribati?</h3>

<p>In 1995 Kiribati moved the <a
href="./faq/docs/international_date.html">International Date Line</a> so that
the entire country is on the western side of it.  As a result, the line is as
far East as 150&#176, farther east than Honolulu.  Because of this eastern
bulge in the International Date line, Kiribati has put forth the claim that
Caroline Island at 10&#176 0' S 150&#176 15' W will be the first point of land
where the Sun will rise.  However, the Sun does not rise here until 15:43
(12/31) UT (5:43 AM local time), 32 minutes after it rises in the first place
in the Antarctic on January 1, 2000 and 29 minutes later on January 1, 2001.
Although it is in tropical seas, Caroline Island is <emph>not more accessible
than Antarctica</emp>.  Caroline Island is actually an atoll of 22 small
islets stretched over 11 km protected by a very shallow reef, so you can only
get there by shallow draft boat or seaplane.

<p>Similarly, the Sun rises at South East Point on Christmas Island, the
most south-easterly of the inhabited islands in Kiribati, at 16:31 (12/31) UT,
6:31 AM local time.  The sunrise at Pitt Island in the Chatham Islands, New
Zealand occurs 27 minutes earlier.

<a name="refraction"></a>
<h3>7. How much does refraction affect the time of sunrise?</h3>

<p>Aside from the sunrise times determined by Royal Greenwich Observatory,
most of the sunrise times given elsewhere for these places are later than the
times given here, so it is almost certain that those determinations of sunrise
did not take into account the effects of refraction.  That is, the atmosphere
of the Earth bends the light of the Sun by about 34' at the horizon at sea
level, making the Sun appear above the horizon when it is geometrically below
the horizon.  In January, the angle that the Sun makes with the horizon as it
rises and sets becomes shallower as you go farther south, so the effect of
refraction on sunrise and sunset times becomes more pronounced.  That is, as
you go further south the Sun is skimming along the horizon, just below the
geometric terminator, but can be seen above the horizon.  At some extreme
southern latitudes (near the Antarctic circle) the sun stays in the region
between the geometric terminator and 34' below the geometric terminator and
never appears to set.  This is the reason that the Sun does not appear to set
30' outside the Antarctic Circle on January 1, 2000 (26' on January 1, 2001).
However, at the equator the Sun rises nearly perpendicular to the horizon, so
the difference between time the Sun rises and when it is above the geometric
terminator is only a couple of minutes.  Once refraction is included, the Sun
is seen earlier in the Antarctic and at Pitt Island than it is seen at
Caroline Island and Christmas Island, respectively.

<p>The value of 34' for refraction at the horizon is its average value, that
is the actual value can vary depending on the local temperature, atmospheric
pressure, and other weather related variables.  Changes in the refraction near
the equator will change the the time of sunrise.  There is a 32% chance that
the time of sunrise will be off by more than 38 seconds.  This is the reason
why the time of sunrise is calculated only to the nearest minute.  Near the
northern and southern extremes where the Sun is skimming the horizon, the
change in refraction can cause the Sun to appear further north or south than
expected and cause an expected sunrise to either occur several minutes later
than expected, or not occur at all because the Sun never set!  At the extreme
southern limit of the terminator in Antarctica, the sunrise has a 32% chance
of occurring either more than 18 km out to sea or an equal distance inland.

<p>All of these calculations are made for sea level and include standard
atmospheric refraction.  There is a chance that at an elevated location near
the described spot, the Sun will rise there first because of its altitude
above sea level.  If there is a 1000 m high mountain 100 km west from where
sunrise occurs at sea level, the peak of the mountain will see the Sun rise at
about the same time as at the sea level position.  For hills and mountains
near the coast, a 100 ft. (30 m) change in altitude will change the time in
sunrise by about 1 minute.

<h3>9. What is the first place in the United States where the Sun
rises on January 1, local time?</h3>

<p>If U.S. territories are included, the first sunrise on January 1 is at
at 19:27 (12/31)UT or 7:27 local time at Peacock Pt. (19&#176 16' N 166&#176
35' E) on Wake Island. However, aside from the occasional government
employee or contractor, Wake Island is uninhabited. The first inhabited land
in the U.S. where the sunrise will occur is at 20:44 (12/31) UT or 6:44 AM
local time in Guam at Inarajan (13&#176 17' N 144&#176 45' E). The Sun will
first the peak of Lamlam Mountain, Guam three minutes earlier at 6:41 local
time.  If the territories are not included the earliest sunrise is nearly
fifteen and a half hours later at 12:04 UT or 7:04 EST at the summit of
Cadillac Mountain, Maine (44&#176 21' N 68&#176 13' W).  The earliest sunrise
at sea level occurs at 12:06 UT or 7:06 EST at Lubec, Maine (44&#176 50' N
67&#176 0' W) and Siasconset, Massachusetts (41&#176 15' N 69&#176 58' W) on
Nantucket Island. For those who thought it would be the peak of Katahdin
Mountain, Maine, the Sun rises there 1 minute later at 12:07 UT or 7:07 EST.
The first major metropolitan area in the United States to see the Sun rise is
Miami Beach, Florida (25&#176 47'N 80&#176 16'W) at 7:07 EST, the same time as
the sunrise at the summit of Katahdin Mountain, Maine.
