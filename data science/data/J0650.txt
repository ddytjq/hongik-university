    <p align="left" style="margin-top: 1"><font size="2" face="Arial">It had been
    almost two
    years since I first took Jim Russell's Techniques of Racing Class (TRC) at
    Sears Point Raceway in Sonoma, California (see <a href="../oldstuff/1117RussellTRC.htm">1999
    article</a>).&nbsp; Three weeks ago I went back for
    their advanced class called, not surprisingly, the Advanced Racing Course (ARC).&nbsp; Graduating from this class qualifies you to apply for an
    official USAC drivers license.&nbsp; Needless to say, it's a bit more serious business.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Upon arriving at Sears Point on
    Monday morning, the first thing I noticed was how different the place
    was.&nbsp; I hardly recognized it.&nbsp; Speedway Motorsports, the track
    owners, have embarked on a massive upgrade project.&nbsp; New garages,
    repaving, safety upgrades and more.&nbsp; But the most notable change is the
    massive embankments they are building almost all the way around the
    track.&nbsp; These embankments will contain tiered seating making it perhaps
    the best road race circuit in the USA from a spectator's standpoint.&nbsp; Being an
    engineer,&nbsp;I have been to a lot of large construction projects before,
    but the magnitude of what the numerous giant earthmovers and bulldozers are creating is
    quite spectacular.</font></p>

    map</a> shows the Sears Point Raceway.&nbsp; Because of the construction,
    the track for the school was modified.&nbsp; Turns 10, 11 and 12 were all
    torn up and the construction crews built a temporary connection between turn
    9 and turn 1.&nbsp; That took away one of the best passing zones under
    braking for the turn 11 hairpin, but the turn 9/1 chute would turn out to be
    plenty challenging.&nbsp; As you read further, you will see the class is still a great program even though we did not have use of the full track.
    In April 2002 we should see all the repaving and construction for the track complete.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Day 1</b><br>
    After the normal first day
    sign-in exercise, we were suited up and off to the classroom to review some
    of the basics from the TRC.&nbsp; I was glad they did that for I thought I
    might be a bit rusty after two years.&nbsp; Rain was forecast today so the
    instructors were anxious to get us in the cars as soon as
    possible.&nbsp;</font></p>

    size rear wing and racing slicks.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The first 30 minutes in the car
    were spent practicing our heel-and-toe downshifting and getting familiar with
    clutchless upshifts.&nbsp;Surprisingly, I found heel-and-toe downshifting
    was like riding a bike.&nbsp; Although I had not done it since my TRC class
    two years ago, it came back to me as second nature.&nbsp; I was rather
    surprised.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">After a short classroom session it was back in
    the car for our first laps around the modified (due to construction) Sear
    Point track.&nbsp; This was our first chance to push the car a little and my best lap time of this session was a 1:37.249 min. lap with the rev limit
    set at just 5,000 RPM.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">After lunch it began to sprinkle
    and we spent some time in the classroom going over wet weather
    driving.&nbsp; The trick in wet weather is to be smooth, brake in a straight
    line, a balanced throttle through the corner, and ease onto the throttle
    only as you unwind the wheel.&nbsp; We were told to go to a balanced
    throttle earlier and earlier as our speeds increased.</font></p>

    and our first chance to do some passing, but only in specific passing zones
    only.&nbsp; The track was damp but not wet enough for rain tires.&nbsp;
    After several laps in the mid 1:40's I started to push a little harder once
    I got plenty of heat in the tires.&nbsp; My times then dropped to 1:37.339,
    1:37.249, 1:36.371 and then a fast lap of 1:35.225 min.&nbsp; After these 16
    or so laps in the car I already started to feel some muscle aches and began to perspire.&nbsp; Sears Point is a very demanding track - no real
    long straights to rest and you're almost constantly turning, braking and
    shifting hard.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">After getting out of the cars we
    were individually critiqued before getting a&nbsp; third session in the
    car.&nbsp; This time the revs were bumped up to 5,300 RPM, which made it a
    bit easier to avoid always hitting the rev limiter.&nbsp; After a slow warm-up
    lap I started to push a little too hard too fast and got two wheels off on
    the tight downhill right-hander at turn 9.&nbsp; This earned me a quick
    black flag to get the car checked out.&nbsp; Everything was OK so back out I
    went.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">This time my lap times came down
    quicker and I bettered my previous best lap on my 9th and 10th circuit with
    two laps at 1:34.648 and 1:34.556 min.&nbsp; The session ended and I felt
    pretty worn out by that time, but was happy because I passed a lot of cars
    and no one passed me all day.&nbsp; After a debriefing I packed up and headed back
    to the hotel to rest my aching body.&nbsp; I can tell you I was one hurting puppy.&nbsp;
    Anyone who says a race car driver isn't an athlete hasn't driven a race car
    on a road course in anger for any extended period of time.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Rain was forecast for Tuesday
    and rain it did.&nbsp; I always wanted to drive a race car in the rain, so I
    was looking forward to this day.&nbsp; Upon arriving at the track we were
    issued rain coats to wear over our driving uniforms.&nbsp; Later I would be
    thankful they did.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Before they sent us out on the
    real race course, they laid out cones and setup two different courses, one
    an oval, and one a slalom.&nbsp; Instead of putting rain tires all around,
    they put rains on the front and slicks on the back.&nbsp; Talk about a
    'loose' car, it was going to be a handful to drive.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">First instructor John Knoeller
    gave the class a demonstration on how to drive a car sideways in the
    rain.&nbsp; He did 180's and 360's and full power slides just to demonstrate
    how to balance the throttle and wring the most out of a car with the backend
    (slicks on rear) that seems to have a mind of its own.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">First we started with the oval
    track.&nbsp; Now I know why they don't run oval races in the rain.&nbsp; My
    first problem was visibility.&nbsp; It was raining so hard when I got in the
    car the track was very wet, but that was the least of my worries.&nbsp; My
    helmet visor was fogging up so badly I could hardly see a thing.&nbsp; I
    tried driving with the visor up, but do you know what it's like having your
    pupils blasted with rain and dirt filled spray from the tires?&nbsp;
    Realizing that wasn't going to work, I quickly went to plan B.&nbsp; I
    cracked the visor about an inch and tilted my head backwards in the turns so
    I could see out the crack in the visor.&nbsp; I could not imagine doing that
    at over 150 mph.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Other than the vision problem,
    driving was a blast.&nbsp; I looped the car more than a few times, but I
    never would have been able to drive my street car that out of shape, for fear
    of crashing it into something, let alone running afoul of the police.&nbsp;
    If was the first time I really had the opportunity to learn to drive fast in
    the rain and not have to worry if I went over the edge of no return.&nbsp;
    The more laps I did the faster I got.&nbsp; I never did so much sawing at
    the wheel and playing with the throttle to gain control of a car, especially
    one that tail happy.&nbsp; But by the end of the session I was starting to
    get good at controlling the balance of the car with the throttle and the
    wheel.&nbsp; It was a great learning experience, not only for future driving
    in the rain, but also how to handle a car when it got out of shape in the
    dry.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The slalom course in the wet was
    just as much fun.&nbsp; Set up like a mini road course, the car was a real
    handful, especially over the paint stripes that made it almost impossible to
    put the throttle down without getting wheelspin and looping it, which of
    course I, like everyone else did.&nbsp; If you didn't loop it you probably
    weren't trying hard enough.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Wet and cold, I was nevertheless
    looking forward to getting out on the full course in the wet after
    lunch.&nbsp; I was disappointed.&nbsp; During the lunch break the skies
    began to clear and the track was drying from the wind.&nbsp; By the time we
    got in the cars and on the track there were only a few damp spots left, so
    it was full dries for everyone.&nbsp; They disconnected the sway bars to
    soften up the suspension a bit, making the cars a bit more forgiving in the
    damp cool conditions.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">With the track damp we were
    cautioned to take our time getting heat into the tires and the oil and water
    temps up. Revs were limited to 5,500 RPM, 200 more than the end of the
    previous day.&nbsp; After a 1:52.332 min. first lap, I gradually picked up
    the pace with a 1:46.0, a 1:46.4, a 1:40.6 and a 1:38.891.&nbsp; I then hit
    a long line of traffic and no one in front of me was making a move to pass
    anyone. In this situation we instructed not to pass a car if that car was
    close behind another car.&nbsp; It was for our own protection, because there
    was a concern we might get together if two of us made a move to pass at the
    same time.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I was frustrated as my lap times
    went up to 1:53.689, and 1:56.083.&nbsp; Our instructors told us to pit and
    ask for space if we got into that situation, so I did.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"> Back out on a
    clear track, I put in three laps at 1:38.390, 1:36.643 and then 1:34.988,
    almost my best lap to date.&nbsp; I then came up on traffic and the fun
    began.&nbsp; My next lap time was slower at 1:36.785 but I passed two cars
    on that lap.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

    hard and caught another car heading into turn 5. I banged 5th gear just
    before the turn-in point and swung wide midway through turn 5 to try an
    outside pass.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"> Turn 5 is vision
                  blurring, high g-load right-hand sweeper taken flat out.&nbsp;
                  There is a bump in the
    pavement right after the turn-in point if you go off line to pass, and it caught me out a
    bit.&nbsp; The car stepped out sideways in a big way, but that wet weather
    driving in the morning really paid off big time now.&nbsp; I never lifted
    and although the car was still fishtailing down the straight, I was able to
    keep control and make the pass under braking for the downhill turn 6.&nbsp;
                  I kept my foot in it even though my brain said &quot;lift you
                  idiot.&quot;&nbsp; Because I never
    lifted, my lap time was a respectable 1:35.372, even with traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp;That
                  was my best pass of the three days.&nbsp; I flirted with
                  disaster and lived to tell about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I passed two cars on the last lap of the day under braking for turn 9. I thought that was going
    to draw me a big tongue lashing because we weren't supposed to do that, but
    I guess the spotters never saw it.&nbsp; I&nbsp; got away with one.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">After our normal post-track debriefing,
    Day 2 was over.&nbsp; Again I was sweaty and tired, but satisfied that I had
    passed a lot of cars over the past two days and was never passed.&nbsp; In
    fact no one ever came up behind me and filled my mirrors.&nbsp; By this time
    I was feeling cocky, but something told me I was only fooling
    myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Day 3 would tell another story.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Day 3</b></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I was hoping for sunshine on Day
    3, our last day, and the weatherman cooperated nicely.&nbsp; The first order
    of business was learning how to do side-by-side rolling starts.&nbsp; After
    a classroom session to go over the rules of a rolling start, we spent the
    first 45-minutes in the car taking turns starting from the pole, outside
    pole, and further on back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The goal was to see who can get
    to the first turn first.&nbsp; When you were starting in the first two rows,
    it was realistic to expect you might race for the lead going into turn
    1.&nbsp; Starting any further back and the best you could hope for was to
    make up positions on those beside or in front of you.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Our rev limit
    was bumped up to 6,000 RPM, which meant you could wind the engine right up
    to the higher rev limit before grabbing the next gear. The rolling starts
    were slow enough that 2nd gear was used for all starts.&nbsp; I'm not sure
    if my car (now the #3 after my original car, the #17, developed an oil leak)
    had a bit more HP, if I just shifted faster, or if the others around me were
    not using all the revs available to them, but my little Hot Rod won every
    drag race to turn 1. Even from row 3, I was able to get into turn 1 as high
    as 2nd place.&nbsp; I did feel like a fool on one start, however, as I had
    the car in 3rd gear instead of 2nd on the start. Fortunately the guy beside
    me missed a shift, and I was able to make up for my stupidity and get
    alongside him.&nbsp; I then braked as hard as I could without locking up the
    fronts to grab the corner first.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">All-in-all, a fun exercise.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Next up was more race
    laps.&nbsp; With more rev's at my disposal, I was determined to beat my previous
    best lap time of 1:34.891 min.&nbsp; Whereas I ran laps on cold tires in the
    1:50 range on the first two days, with the warm sun now out to heat the
    track and tires, and feeling much
    better about controlling a car that gets a little out of shape, I
    immediately banged out a 1:37.620 lap followed by a 1:35.040 and then a
    1:31.830.&nbsp; I took 3 seconds off my previous best time by my third lap.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">After that I hit traffic every
    lap, but rather than pull into the pits to get some space, I decided to stay
    out there and see how many cars I could pick off.&nbsp; My goal was to see
    if I could not only turn quick laps by myself, but to also see if I could
    race.&nbsp; After all, this was a Advanced 'Racing' Course.&nbsp; My lap
    times suffered because of traffic, fluctuating between a slow lap of
    1:36.548 and and quick lap of 1:31.578, but I picked off 8 cars in 11 laps
    so I came out of the session feeling good.&nbsp; This was fun.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">During lunch break I kept asking
    myself, could I break the 1:30 barrier?&nbsp; Did I have it in me?&nbsp;
    Instructor Ric McCormick gave me a few pointers as to where I was losing
    time.&nbsp; I was picking up the throttle too late for turn 3A and my exit
    out of turn 4 was off because I was braking too deep for the corner.&nbsp;
    In fact, Ric told me I was braking too deep for all the corners. He said try
    braking a bit early, concentrate on getting a better line through the
    corner, and picking up the throttle earlier coming out.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Well his advice worked. The
    first session after lunch saw my times drop to 1:31, then 1:30 and then two
    sub 1:30 laps at 1:29.702 and then 1:29.404 min.&nbsp; I had done it, I had
    broken the 1:30 barrier, certainly much faster than when I started on Day 1
    at 1:44 min., but was there more?&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Up until that session no one had
    yet passed me.&nbsp; However, even though that was my fastest session to
    date, one car did blow by me.&nbsp; It was one of the instructors testing
    what appeared to be a new car with special 'Penske' shocks.&nbsp; They
    warned us not to try and keep up with him, so when I saw him in my mirrors,
    I let him past right away.&nbsp; Any thoughts of trying to keep up with him
    were quickly erased, however.&nbsp; He was pulling away from me through the
    turns and down the straights.&nbsp; He was flying.&nbsp; Granted he had
    thousands of laps in these cars and his car had special shocks, but I
    realized then and there, I wasn't ready to take on the big boys without a
    lot more seat time.&nbsp; Taking a class and doing well is one thing, but
    winning races against guys who drive for a living, is a whole different
    story.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">One more session for the
    day.&nbsp; Could I go even faster?&nbsp; Certainly there was more in the
    car, but was there more in me?&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The rev limit was bumped up a
    bit higher, I was ready.&nbsp; 1:35.037 on my first lap out, two seconds
    better than my previous session.&nbsp; I was on it.&nbsp; By my 4th lap I
    was down to 1:30.465.&nbsp; Then traffic and a 1:33.15 and
    1:38.834.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">After getting by those three
    cars, I had a bit of clear road ahead.&nbsp; Two successive laps in the 1:30
    bracket and then I blew it.&nbsp; I missed my line through the uphill 3A/3B
    esses and ran wide on the exit of 3B.&nbsp; I never lifted and still turned
    a 1:30.535 lap, but the off earned me a black flag to have the car checked
    out.&nbsp; After losing 3 or more laps in the pits, I went back out only to
    see the checkered flag fall after my first warm-up lap.&nbsp; I was mad as
    hell at myself for missing what was probably the best chance to break into
    the 1:28's or 1:27's.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">How tired was I?&nbsp; I sat in
    the car for a couple of minutes before I lifted myself out.&nbsp; I was
    mentally and physically spent.</font></p>

    spectrum of courses including Open-Wheel Racing Courses and a Race Series,
    Highway Survival, Corporate Adventures, Karting, High Performance in your
    own vehicle, and more! The Open-Wheel Racing Programs range from a ½ day
    experience, to 3-day Techniques and Advanced Courses to racing for prizes in
    the USAC Formula Russell Championship Series. From novice to pro, Russell
    Racing programs allow students to learn and fulfill their desires and
    talents.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the 40 years of its
    existence, many great race drivers have come through the Russell racing
    school.&nbsp; Most recently CART Champ Car driver Memo Gidley, who was the
    1992 USAC Formula Russell Racing champion.&nbsp; Al Unser Jr. even sent his
    son, Mini Al,&nbsp; to this school to learn.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The Driver Development Course is
    a one-on-one personalized instruction that is customized to your needs with
    emphasis on improving speed, consistency, and lap times. Data acquisition
    and/or on-board cameras can be incorporated into the program in order to
    closely examine how you drive a race car and assist you in improving your
    driving skills.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Each year graduates of Russell's
    TRC and ARC courses compete in the Grad Run-Offs for a free season of
    racing. That's right. A free season of racing in the USAC Formula.&nbsp; To
    get ready for a race weekend, or just fine tune your racing skills, do their
    Thursday and Friday lapping days. You get lots of seat time, and
    personalized feedback from their race-seasoned instructors.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Do you think you want to try
    your hands at learning how to really drive a race car?&nbsp; It's one thing

    many 'driving experience' programs out there, but the courses offered by <a href="http://www.russellracing.com">Russell
    Racing</a> are a bit more serious.&nbsp; You learn a hell of a lot more, and
    you come out of their advanced courses ready to really race.&nbsp; If you
    want to see if you have what it takes, try out the TRC and ARC
    courses.&nbsp; It will be the best three days of your life, and if you do it
    during the slower winter months, between now and March 2002, you'll save
    yourself some of your hard earned money to boot.</font></p>
