<H1> Introduction to C Programming</H1>

<!-- ~~~~~~~~ Page content ~~~~~~~~ -->



<H2>Objectives</H2>
<P>This section is designed to give you a general overview of the <B>C</B> programming language. Although much of this section will be expanded in later sections it gives you a taste of what is to come.<P>
<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="why"></A>

<H3>Why use C?</H3>
<B>C</B> has been used successfully for every type of programming problem imaginable from operating systems to spreadsheets to expert systems - and efficient <A HREF="http://www.le.ac.uk/cc/iss/glossary/ccglc.html#47">compilers</A> are available for machines ranging in power from the <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</A> Macintosh to the <A HREF="http://www.cray.com/">Cray</A> supercomputers. The largest measure of <B>C</B>'s success seems to be based on purely practical considerations:<P>
<UL>
<LI>the portability of the compiler;
<LI>the standard library concept;
<LI>a powerful and varied repertoire of operators;
<LI>an elegant syntax;
<LI>ready access to the hardware when needed;
<LI>and the ease with which applications can be optimized by hand-coding isolated procedures
</UL>

<P>C is often called a &quot;Middle Level&quot; programming language. This is not a reflection on its lack of programming power but more a reflection on its capability to access the system's low level functions. Most high-level languages (e.g. Fortran) provides 
everything the programmer might want to do already built into the language. A low level language (e.g. <A HREF="http:/CWIS/AS/CC/GL/ccgla.html#36">assembler</A>) provides nothing other than access to the machines basic instruction set. A middle level language, such as C, probably doesn't supply all the 
constructs found in high-languages - but it provides you with all the building blocks that you will need to produce the results you want!
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="uses"></A>

<H3>Uses of <B>C</B></H3>

C was initially used for system development work, in particular the programs that make-up the operating system. Why use C? Mainly because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as code written in assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be:<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Operating Systems</B>
<LI><B>Language Compilers</B>
<LI><B>Assemblers</B>
<LI><B>Text Editors</B>
<LI><B>Print Spoolers</B>
<LI><B>Network Drivers</B>
<LI><B>Modern Programs</B>
<LI><B>Data Bases</B>
<LI><B>Language Interpreters</B>
<LI><B>Utilities</B>
</UL>

<P>In recent years C has been used as a general-purpose language because of its popularity
with programmers. It is not the world's easiest language to learn and you will certainly
benifit if you are not learning C as your first programming language! C is trendy (I nearly said sexy) - many
well established programmers are switching to C for all sorts of reasons, but mainly because
of the portability that writing standard C programs can offer.
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="history"></A>
<H3>A Brief History of <B>C</B></H3>
<B>C</B> is a general-purpose language which has been closely associated with the <A HREF="http:/CWIS/AS/CC/GL/ccglu.html#5">UNIX</A> operating system for which it was developed - since the system and most of the programs that run it are written in <B>C</B>.

<P>Many of the important ideas of <B>C</B> stem from the language <B>BCPL</B>, developed by Martin Richards. The influence of <B>BCPL</B> on <B>C</B> proceeded indirectly through the language <B>B</B>, which was written by <A HREF="ccccrant.html">Ken Thompson</A> in 1970 at Bell Labs, for the first UNIX system on a <A HREF="http://www.digital.com/">DEC</A> PDP-7. <B>BCPL</B> and <B>B</B> are "typeless" languages whereas <B>C</B> provides a variety of data types.

<P>In 1972 <A HREF="ccccrant.html">Dennis Ritchie</A> at Bell Labs writes <B>C</B> and in 1978 the publication of <A HREF="ccccread.html">The C Programming Language</A> by Kernighan & Ritchie caused a revolution in the computing world.

<P>In 1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) established a committee to provide a modern, comprehensive definition of <B>C</B>. The resulting definition, the ANSI standard, or "ANSI C", was completed late 1988.
<P>
A <A HREF="cccchist.html">Rough Guide to Programming Languages</A> is available on-line for those of you that are interested.
<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="personal"></A>
<H3>C for Personal Computers</H3>
With regards to personal computers  Microsoft C for IBM (or clones) PC's. and Borlands C are seen to be the two most commonly used systems. However, the latest version of Microsoft <B>C</B> is now considered to be the most powerful and efficient <B>C</B> compiler for personal computers.
<P>
<HR>
<P>We hope we have now managed to convince you to continue with this online <B>C </B>course and hopefully in time become a confident <B>C</B> programmer.<P>
