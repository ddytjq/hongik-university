                  BY HARLOW SHAPLEY
       EVOLUTION OF THE IDEA OF GALACTIC SIZE
</PRE>
     
The physical universe [1] was anthropocentric to primitive man.  At a
subsequent stage of intellectual progress it was centered in a restricted
area on the surface of the earth.  Still later, to Ptolemy and his school,
the universe was geocentric; but since the time of Copernicus the sun, as
the dominating body of the solar system, has been considered to be at or
near the center of the stellar realm.  With the origin of each of these
successive conceptions, the system of stars has ever appeared larger than
was thought before.  Thus the significance of man and the earth in the
sidereal scheme has dwindled with advancing knowledge of the physical
world, and our conception of the dimensions of the discernible stellar
universe has progressively changed.  Is not further evolution of our ideas
probable?  In the face of great accumulations of new and relevant
information can we firmly maintain our old cosmic conceptions? 

<p>

[1: The word "universe" is used in this paper in the restricted sense, as 
applying to the total of sidereal systems now known to exist.]

<p>

As a consequence of the exceptional growth and activity of the great
observatories, with their powerful methods of analyzing stars and of
sounding space, we have reached an epoch, I believe, when another advance
is necessary; our conception of the galactic system must be enlarged to
keep in proper relationship the objects our telescopes are finding; the
solar system can no longer maintain a central position.  Recent studies of
clusters and related subjects seem to me to leave no alternative to the
belief that the galactic system is at least ten times greater in diameter -
at least a thousand times greater in volume - than recently supposed. 

<p>

Dr. Curtis [1], on the other hand, maintains that the galactic system has the
dimensions and arrangement formerly assigned it by students of sidereal
structure - he supports the views held a decade ago or so by Newcomb,
Charlier, Eddington, Hertzprung, and other leaders in the stellar
astronomy.  In contrast to my present estimate of the diameter of at least
three hundred thousand light-years Curtis outlines his position as follows: 
[2]

<p>

[1: See Part II of this article, by Heber D. Curtis.] <br>
[2: Quoted from a manuscript copy of his Washington address.]

<p>

"As to the dimensions of the galaxy indicated by our Milky Way, till
recently there has been a fair degree of uniformity in the estimates of
those who have investigated the subject. Practically all have deduced
diameters from 7,000 to 30,000 light years.  I shall assume a maximum
diameter of 30,000 light years as representing sufficiently well this older
view to which I subscribe though this is pretty certainly too large." 

<p>

I think it should be pointed out that when Newcomb was writing on the
subject some twenty years ago, knowledge of those special factors that bear
directly on the size of the universe was extremely fragmentary compared
with our information of to-day.  In 1900, for instance, the radial motions
of about 300 stars were known; now we know the radial velocities of
thousands. Accurate distances were then on record for possibly 150 of the
brightest stars, and now for more than ten times as many.  Spectra were
then available for less than one-tenth of the stars for which we have the
types to-day.  Practically nothing was known at that time of the
photometric and spectroscopic methods of determining distance; nothing of
the radial velocities of globular clusters or of spiral nebulae, or even of
the phenomenon of star streaming. 

<p>

As a further indication of the importance of examining anew the evidence on
the size of stellar systems, let us consider the great globular cluster in
Hercules - a vast sidereal organization concerning which we had until
recently but vague ideas.  Due to extensive and varied researches, carried
on during the last few years at Mount Wilson and elsewhere, we now know the
positions, magnitudes, and colors of all its brightest stars, and many
relations between color, magnitude, distance from the center, and star
density.  We know some of these important correlations with greater
certainty in the Hercules cluster than in the solar neighborhood.  We now
have spectra of many of the individual stars, and the spectral type and
radial velocity of the cluster  as a whole. We know the types and periods
of light variation of its variable stars, the colors and spectral types of
these variables, and something also of the absolute luminosity of the
brightest stars of the cluster from the appearance of their spectra.  Is it
surprising, therefore, that we venture to determine the distance of Messier
13 and similar systems with more confidence than was possible ten years ago
when none of these facts was known, or even seriously considered in cosmic
speculations? 

<p>

If he were writing now, with knowledge of these relevant developments, I
believe Newcomb would not maintain his former view on the probable
dimensions of the galactic system. 

<p>

For instance, Professor Kapteyn has found occasion, with the progress of
his elaborate studies of laws and of stellar luminosity and density, to
indicate larger dimensions of the galaxy than formerly accepted.  In a
paper just appearing as Mount Wilson Contribution, No. 188, [1] he finds,
as a result of the research extending over some 20 years, that the density
of stars along the galactic plane is quite appreciable at a distance of
40,000 light-years - giving a diameter of the galactic system, exclusive of
distant star clouds of the Milky Way, about three times the value Curtis
admits as a maximum for the entire galaxy.  Similarly Russell, Eddington,
and, I believe, Hertzprung, now subscribe to larger values of galactic
dimensions; and Charlier, in a recent lecture before the Swedish
Astronomical Association, has accepted the essential feature of the larger
galaxy, though formerly he identified the local system of B stars with the
whole galactic system and obtained distances of the clusters and dimensions
of the galaxy only a hundredth as large as I derive. 

<p>

SURVEYING THE SOLAR NEIGHBORHOOD

<p>

Let us first recall that the stellar universe, as we know it, appears to be
a very oblate spheroid or ellipsoid - a disk-shaped system composed mainly
of stars and nebulae.  The solar system is not far from the middle plane of
this flattened organization which we call the galactic system.  Looking
away from the plane we see relatively few stars; looking along the plane,
through a great depth of star-populated space, we see great numbers of
sidereal objects constituting the band of light we call the Milky Way.  The
loosely organized star clusters, such as the Pleiades, the diffuse nebulae,
of which the ring nebula is Lyra is a good example, the dark nebulosities -
all these sidereal types appear to be a part of the great galactic system,
and they lie almost exclusively along the plane of the Milky Way.  The
globular clusters, though not in the Milky Way, are also affiliated with
the galactic system; the spiral nebulae appear to be distant objects mainly
if not entirely outside the most populous parts of the galactic region. 

<p>

This conception of the galactic system, as a flattened, watch-shaped
organization of stars and nebulae, with globular clusters and spiral
nebulae as external objects, is pretty generally agreed upon by students of
the subject; but in the matter of the distances of the various sidereal
objects - the size of the galactic system - there are, as suggested above,
widely divergent opinions. We shall, therefore, first consider briefly the
dimensions of that part of the stellar universe concerning which there is
essential unanimity of opinion, and later discuss in more detail the larger
field, where there appears to be a need for modification of the older
conventional view. 

<p>

Possibly the most convenient way of illustrating the scale of sidereal
universe is in terms of our measuring rods, going from terrestrial units to
those of stellar systems.  On the earth's surface we express distances in
units such as inches, feet, or miles.  On the moon, as seen in the
accompanying photograph made with the 100-inch reflector, the mile is still
a usable measuring unit; a scale of 100 miles is indicated on the lunar
scene. 

<p>

Our measuring scale must be greatly increased, however, when we consider
the dimensions of a star - distances on the surface of our sun, for
example.  The large sun-spots shown in the illustration cannot be measured
conveniently in units appropriate to earthly distance - in fact, the whole
earth itself is none too large.  The units for measuring the distances from
the sun to its attendant planets, is, however, 12,000 times the diameter of
the earth; it is the so-called astronomical unit, the average distance from
earth to sun.  This unit, 93,000,000 miles in length, is ample for the
distances of planets and comets.  It would probably suffice to measure the
distances of whatever planets and comets there may be in the vicinity of
other stars; but it, in turn, becomes cumbersome in expressing the
distances from one star to another, for some of them are hundreds of
millions, even a thousand million, astronomical units away. 

<p>

[Text - processor's editor's note: Technical limitations may have caused

version.  The figure captions are included however, and it is believed that
the line of argument is clear.]

<p>

Fig. 3. - Two successive photographs on the same plate of the diffuse
nebula N. G. C. 221, made with the 100-inch reflector to illustrate the
possibility of greatly increasing the photographic power of a large
reflector though the use of accessory devices.  The exposure time for the
picture on the left was fifteen minutes; it was five minutes for the
picture on the right, which was made with the aid of the photographic
intensifier described in Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 6., 127, 1920.  In
preparing the figure the two photographs were enlarged to the same scale. 

<p>

This leads us to abandon the astronomical unit and to introduce the
light-year as a measure for sounding the depth of stellar space.  The
distance light travels in a year is something less than six million million
miles.  The distance from the earth to the sun is, in these units, eight
light minutes.  This distance to the moon is 1.2 light-seconds.  In some
phases of our astronomical problems (studying photographs of stellar
spectra) we make direct microscopic measures of a ten- thousandth of an
inch; and indirectly we measure changes in the wave-length of light a
million times smaller than this; in discussing the arrangement of globular
clusters in space, we must measure a hundred thousand light-years. 
Expressing these large and small measures with reference to the velocity of
light, we have an illustration of the scale of the astronomer's universe -
his measures range from the trillionth of a billionth part of one
light-second, to more than a thousand light centuries.  The ratio of the
greatest measure to the smallest is as 10^33 to 1. 

<p>

It is to be notices that light plays an all-important role in the study of
the universe; we know the physics and chemistry of stars only through their
light, and their distance from us we express by means of the velocity of
light.  The light-year, moreover, has a double value in sidereal
exploration; it is geometrical, as we have seen, and it is historical.  It
tells us not only how far away an object is, but also how long ago the
light we examine was started on its way.  You do not see the sun where it
is, but where it was eight minutes ago.  You do not see faint stars of the
Milky Way as they are now, but more probably as they were when the pyramids
of Egypt were being built; and the ancient Egyptians saw them as they were
at a time still more remote.  We are, therefore, chronologically far behind
events when we study conditions or dynamical behavior in remote stellar
systems; the motions, light emissions, and variations now investigated in
the Hercules cluster are not contemporary, but, if my value of the distance
is correct, they are the phenomena of 36,000 years ago.  The great age of
these incoming pulses of radiant energy is, however, no disadvantage; in
fact, their antiquity has been turned to good purpose in testing the speed
of stellar evolution, in indicating the enormous ages of stars, in
suggesting the vast extent of the universe in time as well as in space. 

<p>

Taking the light-year as a satisfactory unit for expressing the dimensions
of sidereal systems, let us consider the distances of neighboring stars and
clusters, and briefly mention the methods of deducing their space
positions.  For nearby stellar objects we can make direct trigonometric
measures of distance (parallax), using the earth's orbit or the sun's path
through space as a base line.  For many of the more distant stars
spectroscopic methods are available, using the appearance of the stellar
spectra and the readily measurable apparent brightness of the stars.  For
certain types of stars, too distant for spectroscopic data, there is still
a chance of obtaining the distance by means of the photometric method. 
This method is particularly suited to studies of globular clusters; it
consists first in determining, by some means, the real luminosity of a
star, that is, its so-called absolute magnitude, and second, in measuring
its apparent magnitude. Obviously, if a star of known real brightness is
moved away to greater and greater distances, its apparent brightness
decreases; hence, for such stars of known absolute magnitude, it is
possible, using a simple formula, to determine the distance by measuring
the apparent magnitude. 

<p>

It appears, therefore, that although space can be explored for a distance
of only a few hundred light-years by direct trigonometric methods, we are
not forced, by our inability to measure still smaller angles, to
extrapolate uncertainly or to make vague guesses relative to farther
regions of space, for the trigonometrically determined distances can be
used to calibrate the tools of newer and less restricted methods.  For
example, the trigonometric methods of measuring the distance to moon, sun,
and nearer stars are decidedly indirect, compared with the linear
measurement of distance on the surface of the earth, but they are not for
that reason inexact or questionable in principle.  The spectroscopic and
photometric methods of measuring great stellar distance are also indirect,
compared with the trigonometric measurement of small stellar distance, but
they, too, are not for that reason unreliable or of doubtful value.  These
great distances are not extrapolations.  For instance, in the spectroscopic
method, the absolute magnitudes derived from trigonometrically measured
distances are used to derive the curves relating spectral characteristics
to absolute magnitude; and the spectroscopic parallaxes for individual
stars (whether near or remote) are, almost without exception,
interpolations.  Thus the data for nearer stars are used for purposes of
calibration, not as a basis for extrapolation. 

<p>

By one method or the other, the distance of nearly 3,000 individual stars
in the solar neighborhood have now been determined; only a few are within
ten light-years of the sun.  As a distance of about 130 light-years we find
the Hyades, the well known cluster of naked eye stars; at a distance of 600
light-years, according to Kapteyn's extensive investigations, we come to
the group of blue stars in Orion - another physically -organized cluster
composed of giants in luminosity.  At distances comparable to the above
values we also find the Scorpio-Centaurus group, the Pleiades, the Ursa
Major system. 

<p>

There nearby clusters are specifically referred to for two reasons.

<p>

In the first place I desire to point out the prevalence through-out all the
galactic system of clusters of stars, variously organized as to stellar
density and total stellar content.  The gravitational organization of stars
is a fundamental feature in the universe - a double star is one aspect of a
stellar cluster, a galactic system is another.  We may indeed, trace the
clustering motive from the richest of isolated globular clusters such as
the system in Hercules, to the loosely organized nearby groups typified in
the bright stars of Ursa Major.  At one hundred times its present distance,
the Orion cluster would look much like Messier 37 or Messier 11; scores of
telescopic clusters have the general form and star density of the Pleiades
and the Hyades.  The difference between bright and faint clusters of the
galactic system naturally appears to be solely a matter of distance. 

<p>

In the second place I desire to emphasize the fact that the nearby stars we
use as standards of luminosity, particularly the blue stars of spectral
type B, are members of stellar clusters. Therein lies a most important
point in the application of photometric methods.  We might, perhaps,
question the validity of comparing the isolated stars in the neighborhood
of the sun with stars in a compact cluster;  but the comparison of nearby
cluster stars with remote cluster stars is entirely reasonable, since we
are now so far from the primitive anthropocentric notions that it is
foolish to postulate that distance from the earth has anything to do with
the intrinsic brightness of stars. 

<p>

ON THE DISTANCES OF GLOBULAR CLUSTERS

<p>

1. As stated above, astronomers agree on the distances to the nearby stars
and stellar groups - the scale of the part of the universe that we may call
the solar domain.  But as yet there is lack of agreement relative to the
distances of remote clusters, stars, and star clouds - the scale of the
total galactic system.  The disagreement in this last particular is not a
small difference of a few percent, an argument on minor detail; it is a
matter of a thousand percent or more. 

<p>

Curtis maintains that the dimensions I find for the galactic system should
be divided by ten or more (see quotation on page 172); therefore, that
galactic size does not stand in the way of interpreting spiral nebulae as
comparable galaxies (a theory that he favors on other grounds but considers
incompatible with the larger values of galactic dimensions).  In his
Washington address, however, he greatly simplified the present discussion
by accepting the results of recent studies on the following significant
points: 

<p>

Proposition A. - The globular clusters form a part of our galaxy; therefore
the size of the galactic system proper is most probably not less than the
size of subordinate system of globular clusters. 

<p>

Proposition B. - The distances derived at Mount Wilson for globular
clusters relative to one another are essentially correct.  This implies
among other things that (1) absorption of light in space has not
appreciably affected the results, and (2) the globular clusters are much
alike in structure and constitution, differing mainly in distance.  (These
relative values are based upon apparent diameters, integrated magnitudes,
the magnitude of individual giants or groups of giants, and Cepheid
variables; Charlier has obtained much the same results from apparent
diameters alone, and Lundmark from apparent diameters and integrated
magnitudes.) 

<p>

Proposition C. - Stars in clusters and in distant parts of the Milky Way
are not peculiar - that is, uniformity of conditions and of stellar
phenomena naturally prevails throughout the galactic system. 

<p>

We also share the same opinion, I believe, on the following points:

<p>

a. The galactic system is an extremely flattened stellar organization, and
the appearance of a Milky Way is partly due to the existence of distinct
clouds of stars, and is partly the result of depth along the galactic
plane. 

<p>

b. The spiral nebulae are mostly very distant objects, probably not
physical members of our galactic system. 

<p>

c. If our galaxy approaches the larger order of dimensions, a serious
difficultly at once arises for the theory that spirals are galaxies of
stars comparable in size with our own: it would be necessary to ascribe
impossibly great magnitudes to the new stars that have appeared in the
spiral nebulae. 

<p>

2. Through approximate agreement on the above points, the way is cleared so
that the outstanding difference may be clearly stated: Curtis does not
believe that the numerical value of the distance I derive for any globular
cluster is or the right order of magnitude. 

<p>

3. The present problem may be narrowly restricted therefore, and may be
reformulated as follows: Show that any globular cluster is approximately as
distant as derived at Mount Wilson; then the distance of the other clusters
will be approximately right (see Proposition B), the system of clusters and
the galactic system will have dimensions of the order assigned (see
Proposition A), and the "comparable galaxy" theory of spirals will have met
with a serious, though perhaps not insuperable difficulty. 

<p>

In other words, to maintain my position it will suffice to show that any
one of the bright globular clusters has roughly the distance in light-years
given below, rather than a distance one tenth of this value or less [1]: 

<p>

[1: In the final draft of the following paper Curtis has qualified his 
acceptance of the foregooing propositions in such a manner that in some 
numerical details the comparisons given below are no longer accurately 
applicable to his arguments; I believe, however, that the comparisons do 
correctly contrast the present view with that generally accepted a few 
years ago.]

<p>

Similarly it should suffice to show that the bright objects in clusters are
giants (cf. last column above), rather than stars of solar luminosity. 

<p>

4. From observation we know that some or all of these four clusters contain:

<p>

a. AN interval of at least nine magnitudes (apparent and absolute) between
the brightest and faintest stars. 

<p>
     
b. A range of color-index from -0.5 to +2.0, corresponding to the whole
range of color commonly found among assemblages of stars. 

<p>

c. Stars of types B, A, F, G, K, M (from direct observations of spectra),
and that these types are in sufficient agreement with the color classes to
permit the use of the latter for ordinary statistical considerations where
spectra are not yet known. 

<p>

d. Cepheid and cluster variables which are certainly analogous to galactic
variables of the same types, in spectrum, color change, length of period,
amount of light variation, and all characters of the light curve. 

<p>

e. Irregular, red, small-range variables of the Alpha Orionis type, among
the brightest stars of the cluster. 

<p>

f. Many red and yellow stars of approximately the same magnitude as the
blue stars, in obvious agreement with the giant star phenomena of the
galactic system, and clearly in disagreement with all we know of color and
magnitude relation for dwarf stars. 

<p>

First, as globular cluster is a pretty complete "universe" by itself, with
typical and representative stellar phenomena, including several classes of
stars that in the solar neighborhood are recognized as giants in
luminosity. 

<p>

Second, we are very fortunately situated for the study of distant clusters
- outside rather than inside.  Hence we obtain a comprehensive dimensional
view, we can determine relative real luminosities in place of relative
apparent luminosities, and we have the distinct advantage that the most
luminous stars are easily isolated and the most easily studied.  None of
the brightest stars in a cluster escapes us.  If giants or super-giants are
there, they are necessarily the stars we study. We cannot deal legitimately
with the average brightness of stars in globular clusters, because the
faintest limits are apparently far beyond our present telescopic power. 
Out ordinary photographs record only the most powerful radiators -
encompassing a range of but three or four magnitudes at the very top of the
scale of absolute luminosity, whereas in the solar domain we have a known
extreme range of 20 magnitudes in absolute brightness, and a generally
studied interval of twelve magnitudes or more. 

6. Let us examine some of the conditions that would exist in the Hercules
Cluster (Messier 13) on the basis of the two opposing values for its
distance: 

<PRE>
______________________________________________________________________________

                              36,000 light-years  3,600 light-years or less

     nitude of blue stars (C.I.<0.0)         0              +5, or fainter

     magnitudes of cluster stars        Between -1.0 and -2.0    +3.2, or fainter

d.   Hypothetical annual proper motion       0".004              0".04, or greater
______________________________________________________________________________
</PRE>

<p>

a. The blue stars. - The colors of stars have long been recognized as
characteristic of spectral types and as being of invaluable aid in the
study of faint stars for which spectroscopic observations are difficult or
impossible.  The color-index, as used at Mount Wilson, is the difference
between the so-called photographic (pg) and photovisual (pv.) magnitudes -
the difference between the brightness of objects in blue-violet and in
yellow-green light.  For a negative color-index (C. I. = pg. - pv. < 0.0)
the stars are called blue and the corresponding spectral type is B; for
yellow stars, like the sun (type G), the color-index is about +0.8 mag.;
for redder stars (types K, M) the color-index exceeds a magnitude. 

<p>

An earlier result of the photographic study of Messier 13 at Mount Wilson
was the discovery of large numbers of negative color-indices.  Similar
results were later obtained in other globular and open clusters, and among
the stars of the galactic clouds.  Naturally these negative color-indices
in clusters have been taken without question to indicate that B-type stars
- a supposition that has later been verified spectroscopically with the
Mount Wilson reflectors. [1] 

<p>

[1: Adams and van Maanen published several years ago the radial velocities 
and spectral types of a number of B stars in the double cluster in Perseus, 
Ast. Jour., Albany, N.Y., 27, 1913 (187-188).]

<p>

The existence of 15th magnitude B-type stars in the Hercules cluster seems
to answer decisively the question of its distance, because B stars in the
solar neighborhood are invariably giants (more than a hundred times as
bright as the sun, on the average), and such a giant star can appear to be
of fifteenth magnitude only if it is more than 30,000 light-years away. 

<p>

We have an abundance of material on distances and absolute magnitudes of
the hundreds of neighboring B's - there are direct measures of distance, as
well as mean distances determined from parallactic motions, from observed
luminosity curves, from stream motions, and from radial velocities combined
with proper motion.  Russell, Plummer, Charlier, Eddington, Kapteyn, and
others have worked on these stars with the universal result of finding them
giants. 

<p>

Kapteyn's study of the B stars is one of the classics of modern stellar
astronomy; his methods are mainly the well-tried methods generally used for
studies of nearby stars.  In his various lists of B's more than seventy
percent are brighter than zero absolute photographic magnitude, [1] and only
two out of 424 are fainter than +3.  This result should be compared with
the above-mentioned requirement that the absolute magnitudes of the blue
stars in Messier 13 should be +5 or fainter in the mean, if the distance of
the cluster is 3,600 light-years or less, and no star in the cluster should
be brighter than +3. 

<p>

[1: Stars of types B8 and B9 are customarily treated with A type in 
statistical discussion; even if they are included with the B's, 64 per cent 
of Kapteyn's absolute magnitudes are brighter than zero and only 4 per cent 
are fainter than +2.  No stars of types B8 or B9 fainter than +3 are in 
Kapteyn's lists.]

<p>

A question might be raised as to the completeness of the material used by
Kapteyn and others, for if only the apparently bright stars are studied,
the mean absolute magnitudes may be too high.  Kapteyn, however, entertains
little doubt on this score, and an investigation [2] of the distribution of
B-type stars, based on the Henry Draper Catalogue, shows that faint B's are
not present in the Orion region studied by Kapteyn. 

<p>

[2: Shapley, H., Proceedings Nat. Acad. Sci., 5, 1900 (434-440); a further 
treatment of this problem is to appear in a forthcoming Mount Wilson 
Contribution.]

<p>

The census in local clusters appears to be practically complete without
revealing any B stars as faint as +5.  But if the Hercules cluster were not
more distant than 3,600 light-years, its B stars would be about as faint as
the sun, and the admitted uniformity throughout the galactic system
(Proposition C) would be gain-said: for although near the earth, whether in
clusters or not, the B stars are giants, away from the earth in all
directions, whether in the Milky Way clouds or in clusters, they would be
dwarfs - and the anthropocentric theory could take heart again. 

<p>

Let us emphasize again that the near and the distant blue stars we are
intercomparing are all cluster stars, and that there appears to be no
marked break in the gradation of clusters, either in total content or in
distance, from Orion through the faint open clusters to Messier 13. 

<p>

b. The maximum absolute magnitude of cluster stars. - In various nearby
groups and clusters the maximum absolute photographic brightness,
determined from direct measures of parallax or stream motion or from both,
is known to exceed the following values: 

<p>

<PRE>

					M
Ursa Major system 			-1.0
Moving cluster in Perseus 		-0.5
Hyades 					+1.0
Scorpio-Centaurus cluster 		-2.5
Orion nebula cluster 			-2.5
Pleiades 				-1.0
61 Cygni group [1] 			+1.0

</PRE>

<p>

[1: The absolute visual magnitude of e Virginis (spectrum G6) is 0.0 
according to the Mount Wilson spectroscopic parallax kindly communicated by 
Mr. Adams.]

<p>

No nearby physical group is known, with the possible exception of the 61
Cygnus drift, in which the brightest stars are fainter than +1.0.  The mean
M of the above list of clusters is -0.8; yet for all distant physical
groups it must be +3 or fainter (not withstanding the certain existence
within them of Cepheid variables and B-type stars), if the distance of
Messier 13 is 3,600 light- years or less.  Even if the distance is 8,000
light-years, as Curtis suggests in the following paper, the mean M would
need to be +1.4 or fainter - a value still irreconcilable with observations
on nearby clusters. 

<p>

The requirement that the bright stars in a globular cluster should be
in the maximum only two magnitudes brighter than our sun in equivalent to
saying that in Messier 13 there is not one real giant among its thirty or
more thousand stars.  It is essentially equivalent, in view of Proposition
B, to holding that of the two or three million stars in distant clusters
(about half a million of these stars have been actually photographed) there
is not one giant star brighter than +2.  And we have just seen that direct
measures show that all of our nearby clusters contain such giants; indeed
some appear to be composed mainly of giants. 

<p>

As a further test of the distances of globular clusters, a special
device has been used with the Hooker reflector.  With a thin prism placed
in the converging beam shortly before the focus, we may photograph for a
star (or for each of a group of stars) a small spectrum that extends not
only through the blue region ordinarily photographed, but also throughout
the yellow and red.  By using specially prepared photographic plates,
sensitive in the blue and red but relatively insensitive in the
green-yellow, the small spectra are divided in the middle, and the relative
intensity of the blue and red parts depends, as is well known, on spectral
type and absolute magnitude; giants and dwarfs, of the same type in the
Harvard system of spectral classification, show markedly different spectra.
 The spectral types of forty or fifty of the brighter stars in the Hercules
cluster are known, classified as usual on the basis of spectral lines. 
Using the device described above, a number of these stars have been
photographed side by side on the same plate with well known giants and
dwarfs of the solar neighborhood for which distances and absolute
magnitudes depend on direct measures of parallax.  On the basis of the
smaller distance for Messier 13, the spectra of these cluster stars (being
then of absolute magnitude fainter than +4) should resemble the spectra of
the dwarfs.  But the plates clearly show that in absolute brightness the
cluster stars equal, and in many cases even exceed, the giants - a result
to be expected if the distance if of the order of 36,000 light-years. 

<p>

The above procedure is a variation on the method used by Adams and his
associates on brighter stars where sufficient dispersion can be obtained to
permit photometric intercomparison of sensitive spectral lines.  So far as
it has been applied to clusters, the usual spectroscopic method supports
the above conclusion that the bright red and yellow stars in clusters are
giants. 

<p>

An argument much insisted upon by Curtis is that the average absolute
magnitude of stars around the sun is equal to or fainter than solar
brightness, hence, that average stars we see in clusters are also dwarfs. 
Or, put in a different way, he argues that since the mean spectral class of
a globular cluster is of solar type and the average solar-type star near
the sun is of solar luminosity, the stars photographed in globular clusters
must be of solar luminosity, hence not distant.  This deduction, he holds,
is in compliance with proposition C - uniformity throughout the universe. 
But in drawing the conclusions, Curtis apparently ignores, first, the very
common existence of red and yellow giant stars in stellar systems, and
second, the circumstance mentions above in Section 5 that in treating a
distant external system we naturally first observe its giant stars.  If the
material is not mutually extensive in the solar domain and in the remote
cluster (and it certainly is not for stars of all types), then the
comparison of averages means practically nothing because of the obvious and
vital selection of brighter stars in the cluster.  The comparison should be
of nearby cluster with distant cluster, or of the luminosities of the same
kinds of stars in the two places. 

<p>

Suppose that an observer, confined to a small area in a valley, attempts to
measure the distances of surrounding mountain peaks.  Because of the short
base line allowed him, his trigonometric parallaxes are valueless except
for the nearby hills.  On the remote peaks, however, his telescope shows
green foliage.  First he assumes approximate botanical uniformity
throughout all visible territory.  Then he finds that the average height of
all plants immediately around him (conifers, palms, asters, clovers, etc.)
is one foot.  Correlating this average with the measured angular height of
plants visible against the sky-line on the distant peaks he obtains values
of the distances.  If, however, he had compared the foliage on the nearby,
trigonometrically-measured hills with that on the remote peaks, or had used
some method of distinguishing various floral types, he would not have
mistaken pines for asters and obtained erroneous results for the distances
of the surrounding mountains.  All the principles involved in the botanical
parallax of a mountain peak have their analogues in the photometric
parallax of a globular cluster. 

<p>

c. Cepheid variables. - Giant stars of another class, the Cepheid
variables, have been used extensively in the exploration of globular
clusters.  After determining the period of a Cepheid, its absolute
magnitude is easily found from an observationally derived period-luminosity
curve, and the distance of any cluster containing such variables is
determined as soon as the apparent magnitude is measured.  Galactic
Cepheids and cluster Cepheids are strictly comparable by Proposition C - a
deduction that is amply supported by observations at Mount Wilson and
Harvard, of color, spectrum, light curves, and the brightness relative to
other types of stars. 

<p>

Curtis bases his strongest objections to the larger galaxy on the use I
have made of the Cepheid variables, questioning the sufficiency of the data
and the accuracy of the methods involved.  But I believe that in the
present issue there is little point in laboring over the details for
Cepheids, for we are, if we choose, qualitatively quite independent of them
in determining the scale of the galactic system, and it is only qualitative
results that are now at issue.  We could discard the Cepheids altogether,
use instead either the red giant stars and spectroscopic methods, or the
hundreds of B-type stars upon which the most capable stellar astronomers
have worked for years, and derive much the same distance for the Hercules
cluster, and for other clusters, and obtain consequently similar dimensions
for the galactic system.  In fact, the substantiating results from these
other sources strongly fortify our belief in the assumptions and methods
involved in the use of the Cepheid variables. 

<p>

Since the distances of clusters as given by Cepheid variables are
qualitatively in excellent agreement with the distances as given by blue
stars and by yellow and red giants, discussed in the foregoing sub-sections
a and b, I shall here refer only briefly to four points bearing on the
Cepheid problem, first noting that if the distances of clusters are to be
divided by 10 or 15, the same divisor should be also used for the distances
derived for galactic Cepheids. 

<p>

(1) The average absolute magnitude of typical Cepheids, according to my
discussion of proper motions and magnitude correlations, is about -2.5. 
The material on proper motion has also been discussed independently by
Russell, Hertzsprung, Kapteyn, Str”mberg, and Seares; they all accept
the validity of the method, and agree in making the mean absolute magnitude
much the same as that which I derive.  Seares finds, moreover, from a
discussion of probable errors and of possible systematic errors, that the
observed motions are irreconcilable with an absolute brightness five
magnitudes fainter, because in that case the mean parallactic motion of the
brighter Cepheids would be of the order of 0".160 instead of 0".016 ñ0".002
as observed. 

<p>

Both trigonometric and spectroscopic parallaxes of galactic Cepheids, as
far as they have been determined, support the photometric values in
demanding high luminosity; the spectroscopic and photometric methods are
not wholly independent, however, since the zero point depends in both cases
on parallactic motion. 

<p>

(2) When parallactic motion is used to infer provisional absolute
magnitudes for individual stars (a possible process only when peculiar
motions are small and observations very good), the brighter galactic
Cepheids indicate the correlation between luminosity and period. [1]  The
necessity, however, of neglecting individual peculiar motion and errors of
observation for this procedure makes the correlation appear much less
clearly for galactic Cepheids than for those of external systems (where
proper motions are not concerned), and little importance could be attached
to the period-luminosity curve if it were based on local Cepheids alone. 
When the additional data mentioned below are also treated in this manner,
the correlation is practically obscured for galactic Cepheids, because of
the larger observational errors. 

<p>

[1: Mr. Seares has called my attention to an error in plotting the provisional 
smoothed absolute amgnitudes against log period for the Cepheids discussed 
in Mount Wilson Contribution No. 151.  The preliminary curve for the 
galactic Cepheids is steeper than that for the Small Magellanic Cloud, 
Omega Centauri, and other clusters.]

<p>

On account of the probably universal uniformity of Cepheid phenomena,
however, we need to know only the mean parallactic motion of the galactic
Cepheids to determine the zero point of the curve which is based on
external Cepheids; and the individual motions do not enter the problem at
all, except, as noted above, to indicate provisionally the existence of the
period- luminosity relation.  It is only this mean parallactic motion that
other investigators have used to show the exceedingly high luminosity of
Cepheids.  My adopted absolute magnitudes and distances for all these stars
have been based upon the final period-luminosity curve, and not upon
individual motions. 

<p>

(3) Through the kindness of Professor Boss and Mr. Roy of the Dudley
Observatory, proper motions have been submitted for 21 Cepheids in addition
to the 13 in the Preliminary General Catalogue.  The new material is of
relatively low weight, but the unpublished discussion by Stromberg of
that portion referring to the northern stars introduces no material
alteration of the earlier result for the mean absolute brightness of
Cepheids. 

<p>

It should be noted that the 18 pseudo-Cepheids discussed by Adams and Joy
[1] are without exception extremely bright (absolute magnitudes ranging
from -1 to -4); they are thoroughly comparable with the ordinary Cepheids
in galactic distribution, spectral characteristics, and motion. 

<p>

[1: Adams, W. S., and A. H. Joy, Publ. Ast. Soc. Pac., San Francisco, 
Calif., 31, 1919 (184-186).]

<p>

(4) From unpublished results kindly communicated by van Maanen and by
Adams, we have the following verification of the great distance and high
luminosity of the important, high velocity, cluster-type Cepheid RR Lyrae: 

<p>

<PRE>

Photometric parallax 		0".003 			(Shapley)
Trigonometric parallax 		+0.006 +/- 0.006	(van Maanen)
Spectroscopic parallax 		0.004 			(Adams, Joy, and Burwell)

</PRE>

<p>

The large proper motion of this star, 0".25 annually, led Hertzsprung some
years ago to suspect that the star is not distant, and that it and its
numerous congeners in clusters are dwarfs. The large proper motion,
however, indicates high real velocity rather than nearness, as the above
results show.  More recently, Hertzsprung has reconsidered the problem and,
using the cluster variables, has derived a distance of the globular cluster
Messier 3 in essential agreement with my value. 

<p>

d. Hypothetical annual proper motion. - The absence of observed proper
motion for distant clusters must be an indication of their great distance
because of the known high velocities in the line of sight.  The average
radial velocity of the globular clusters appears to be about 150 km/sec. 
By assuming, as usual, a random distribution of velocities, the transverse
motion of Messier 13 and similar bright globular clusters should be greater
than the quite appreciable value of 0".04 a year if the distance is less
than 3,600 light-years.  No proper motion has been found for distant
clusters; Lundmark has looked into this matter particularly for five
systems and concludes that the annual proper motion is less than 0".01. 

<p>

7. Let us summarize a few of the results of accepting the restricted scale
of the galactic system. 

<p>

If the distance of globular clusters must be decreased to one-tenth, the
light-emitting power of their stars can be only a hundredth that of local
cluster stars of the same spectral and photometric types.  As a
consequence, I believe Russell's illuminative theory of spectral evolution
would have to be largely abandoned, and Eddington's brilliant theory of
gaseous giant stars would need to be greatly modified or given up entirely.
 Now both of these modern theories have their justification, first, in the
fundamental nature of their concepts and postulates, and second, in their
great success in fitting observational facts. 

<p>

Similarly, the period-luminosity law of Cepheid variation would be
meaningless; Kapteyn's researches on the structure of the local cluster
would need new interpretation, because his luminosity laws could be applied
locally but not generally; and a very serious loss to astronomy would be
that of the generality of spectroscopic methods of determining star
distances, for it would mean that identical spectral characteristics
indicate stars differing in brightness by 100 to 1, depending only upon
whether the star is in the solar neighborhood or in a distant cluster. 

<p>

THE DIMENSIONS AND ARRANGEMENT OF THE GALACTIC SYSTEM

<p>

When we accept the view that the distance of the Hercules cluster is such
that its stellar phenomena are harmonious with local stellar phenomena -
its brightest stars typical giants, its Cepheids comparable with our own -
then it follows that fainter, smaller, globular clusters are still more
distant than 36,000 light-years.  One-third of those now known are more
distant than 100,000 light-years; the most distant is more than 200,000
light-years away, and the diameter of the whole system of globular clusters
is about 300,000 light-years. 

<p>

Since the affiliation of the globular clusters with the galaxy is shown by
their concentration to the plane of the Milky Way and their symmetrical
arrangement with respect to it, it also follows that the galactic system of
stars is as large as this subordinate part.  During the past year we have
found Cepheid variables and other stars of high luminosity among the
fifteenth magnitude stars of the galactic clouds; this can only mean that
some parts of the clouds are more distant than the Hercules cluster.  There
seems to be good reason, therefore, to believe that the star-populated
regions of the galactic system extend at least as far as the globular
clusters. 

<p>

One consequence of accepting the theory that clusters outline the form and
extent of the galactic system, is that the sun is found to be very distant
from the middle of the galaxy.  it appears that we are not far the center
of a large local cluster or cloud, but that cloud is at least 50,000
light-years from the galactic center.  Twenty years ago Newcomb remarked
that the sun appears to be in the galactic plane because the Milky Way is a
great circle - an encircling band of light - and that the sun also appears
near the center of the universe because the star density falls off with
distance in all directions.  But he concludes as follows: 

<p>

"Ptolemy showed by evidence, which, from his standpoint, looked as sound as
that which we have cited, that the earth was fixed in the center of the
universe.  May we not be the victim of some fallacy, as he was?" 

<p>

Our present answer to Newcomb's question is that we have been victimized by
restricted methods of measuring distance and by the chance position of the
sun near the center of a subordinate system; we have been misled, by the
consequent phenomena, into thinking that we are in the midst of things.  In
much the same way ancient man was misled by the rotation of the earth, with
the consequent apparent daily motion of all heavenly bodies around the
earth, into believing that even his little planet was the center of the
universe, and that his earthly gods created and judged the whole. 

<p>

If man had reached his present intellectual position in a later geological
era, he might not have been led to these vain conceits concerning his
position in the physical universe, for the solar system is rapidly receding
from the galactic plane, and is moving away from the center of the local
cluster.  If that motion remains unaltered in direction and amount, in a
hundred million years or so the Milky Way will be quite different from an
encircling band of star clouds, the local cluster will be a distant object,
and the star density will no longer decrease with distance from the sun in
all directions. 

<p>

Another consequence of the conclusion that the galactic system is of the
order of 300,000 light-years in greatest diameter, is the previously
mentioned difficulty it gives to the "comparable- galaxy" theory of spiral
nebulae.  I shall not undertake a description and discussion of this
debatable problem.  Since the theory probably stands or falls with the
hypothesis of a small galactic system, there is little point in discussing
other material on the subject, especially in view of the recently measured
rotations of spiral nebulae which appear fatal to such an interpretation. 

<p>

It seems to me that the evidence, other than the admittedly critical tests
depending on the size of the galaxy, is opposed to the view that the
spirals are galaxies of stars comparable with our own.  In fact, there
appears as yet no reason for modifying the tentative hypothesis that the
spirals are not composed of typical stars at all, but are truly nebulous
objects.  Three very recent results are, I believe, distinctly serious for
the theory that spiral nebulae are comparable galaxies - (1) Seares'
deduction that none of the known spiral nebulae has a surface brightness as
small as that of our galaxy; (2) Reynold's study of the distribution of
light and color in typical spirals, from which he concludes they cannot be
stellar systems; and (3) van Maanen's recent measures of rotation in the
spiral M 33, corroborating his earlier work on Messier 101 and 81, and
indicating that these bright spirals cannot reasonably be the excessive
distant objects required by the theory. 

<p>

But even if spirals fail as galactic systems, there may be elsewhere in
space stellar systems equal to or greater than ours - as yet unrecognized
and possibly quite beyond the power of existing optical devices and preset
measuring scales.  The modern telescope, however, with such accessories as
high-power spectroscopes and photographic intensifiers, is destined to
extend the inquiries relative to the size of the universe much deeper into
space, and contribute further to the problem of other galaxies.

                       PART II
                 BY HEBER D. CURTIS
       DIMENSIONS AND STRUCTURE OF THE GALAXY

</PRE>

<p>

Definition of units employed. - The distance traversed by light in one
year, 9.5x10^12 km., or nearly six trillion miles, known as the light-year,
has been in use for about two centuries as a means of visualizing stellar
distances, and forms a convenient and easily comprehended unit. Throughout
this paper the distances of the stars will be expressed in light-years. 

<p>

The absolute magnitude of a star is frequently needed in order that we may
compare the luminosities of different stars in terms of some common unit. 
It is the apparent magnitude which the star would have if viewed from the
standard distance of 32.6 light-years (corresponding to a parallax of
0".1). 

<p>

Knowing the parallax, or the distance, of a star, the absolute magnitude
may be computed from one of the simple equations: <br>
<PRE>
Abs. Magn. = App. Magn. + 5 + 5 x log (parallax in seconds of arc) 
Abs. Magn. = App. Magn. + 7.6 - 5 x log (distance in light-years). 
</PRE>

<p>

Limitations in studies of galactic dimensions. - By direct methods the
distances of individual stars can be determined with considerable accuracy
out to a distance of about two hundred light-years. 

<p>

At a distance of three hundred light-years (28 x 10^14 km.) the radius of
the earth's orbit (1.5 x 10^8 km) subtends an angle slightly greater than
0".01, and the probable error of the best modern photographic parallax
determinations has not yet been reduced materially below this value.  The
spectroscopic method of determining stellar distance through the absolute
magnitude probably has, at present, the same limitations as the
trigonometric method upon which the spectroscopic method depends for its
absolute scale. 

<p>

A number of indirect methods have been employed which extend out reach into
space somewhat farther for the average distances of large groups or classes
of stars, but give not information as to the individual distances of the
stars of the group or class.  Among such methods may be noted as most
important the various correlations which have been made between the proper
motions of the stars and the parallactic motion due to the speed of our sun
in space, or between the proper motions and the radial velocities of the
stars. 

<p>

The limitations of such methods of correlation depend, at present, upon the
fact that accurate proper motions are known, in general, for the brighter
stars only.  A motion of 20 km/sec. across our line of sight will produce
the following annual proper motions: <br>
<PRE>
Distance 	100 l.y. 	500 l.y. 	1,000 l.y.
Annual p.m. 	0".14   	0".03 		0".01
</PRE>

<p>

The average probable error of the proper motions of Boss is about 0".006. 
Such correlation methods are not, moreover, a simple matter of comparison
of values, but are rendered difficult and to some extent uncertain by the
puzzling complexities brought in by the variation of the space motions of
the stars with spectral type, stellar mass (?), stellar luminosity (?), and
still imperfectly known factors of community star drift. 

<p>

[Text editor's comment: The question marks appearing in the previous 
paragraph appear in the published document.]

<p>

It will then be evident that the base-line available in studies of the more
distant regions of our galaxy in woefully short, and that in such studies
we must depend largely upon investigations of the distribution and of the
frequency of occurrence of stars of the different apparent magnitudes and
spectral types, on the assumption that the more distant stars, when taken
in large numbers, will average about the same as known nearer stars.  This
assumption is a reasonable one, though not necessarily correct, as we have
little certain knowledge of galactic regions as distant as five hundred
light-years. 

<p>

Were all the stars of approximately the same absolute magnitude, or if this
were true even for the stars of any particular type or class, the problem
of determining the general order of the dimensions of our galaxy would be
comparatively easy. 

<p>

But the problem is complicated by the fact that, taking the stars of all
spectral types together, the dispersion in absolute luminosity is very
great.  Even with the exclusion of a small number of stars which are
exceptionally bright or faint, this dispersion probably reaches ten
absolute magnitudes, which would correspond to a hundred-fold uncertainty
in distance for a given star.  However, it will be seen later that we
possess moderately definite information as to the average absolute
magnitude of the stars of the different spectral types. 

<p>

Dimensions of our galaxy. - Studies of the distribution of the stars and of
the ratio between the numbers of stars of successive apparent magnitudes
have led a number of investigators to the postulation of fairly accordant
dimensions for the galaxy; a few may be quoted: <br>
Wolf; about 14,000 light-years in diameter. <br>
Eddington; about 15,000 light-years. <br>
Shapley (1915); about 20,000 light-years. <br>
Newcomb; not less than 7,000 light-years; later - perhaps 30,000 
light-years in diameter and 5,000 light-years in thickness. <br>
Kapteyn; about 60,000 light-years. [1]

<p>

[1: A complete bibliography of the subject would fill many pages.  
Accordingly, references to authorities will in general be omitted.  An 
excellent and nearly complete list of references may be found in Lundmark's 
paper, - "The Relations of the Globular Clusters and Spiral nebulae to the 
Stellar System," in K. Svenska Vet. Handlingar, Bd. 60, No. 8, p. 71, 
1920.]

<p>

General structure of the galaxy. - From the lines of investigation
mentioned above there has been a similar general accord in the deduced
results as to the shape and structure of the galaxy: 

<p>

1. The stars are not infinite in number, nor uniform in distribution.

<p>

2. Our galaxy, delimited for us by the projected contours of the Milky Way,
contains possibly a billion suns. 

<p>

3. This galaxy is shaped much like a lens, or a thin watch, the thickness
being probably less than one-sixth of the diameter. 

<p>

4. Our Sun is located fairly close to the center of figure of the galaxy.

<p>

5. The stars are not distributed uniformly through the galaxy.  A large
proportion are probably actually within the ring structure suggested by the
appearance of the Milky Way, or are arranged in large and irregular regions
of greater star density.  The writer believes that the Milky Way is at
least as much a structural as a depth effect. 

<p>

A spiral structure has been suggested for our galaxy; the evidence for such
a spiral structure is not very strong, except as it may be supported by the
analogy of the spirals as island universes, but such a structure is neither
impossible nor improbable.  The position of our Sun near the center of
figure of the galaxy is not a favorable one for the precise determination
of the actual galactic structure. 

<p>

Relative paucity of galactic genera. - Mere size does not necessarily
involve complexity; it is a remarkable fact that in a galaxy of a thousand
million objects we observe, not ten thousand different types, but perhaps
not more than five main classes, outside the minor phenomena of our own
solar system. 

<p>

1. The stars. - The first and most important class is formed by the stars. 
In accordance with the type of spectrum exhibited, we may divide the stars
into some eight or ten main types; even when we include the consecutive
internal gradations within these spectral classes it is doubtful whether
present methods will permit us to distinguish as many as a hundred separate
subdivisions in all.  Average space velocities vary from 10 to 30 km/sec.,
there being a well- marked increase in average space velocity as one
proceeds from the blue to the redder stars. 

<p>

2. The globular star clusters are greatly condensed aggregations of from
ten thousand to one hundred thousand stars.  Perhaps one hundred are known.
 Though quite irregular in grouping, they are generally regarded as
definitely galactic in distribution.  Space velocities are of the order of
300 km/sec. 

<p>

3. The diffuse nebulae are enormous, tenuous, cloud-like masses; fairly
numerous; always galactic in distribution.  They frequently show a gaseous
spectrum, though many agree approximately in spectrum with their involved
stars.  Space velocities are very low. 

<p>

4. The planetary nebulae are small, round, or oval, and almost always with
a central star. Fewer than one hundred and fifty are known.  They are
galactic in distribution; spectrum is gaseous; space velocities are about
80 km/sec. 

<p>

5. The spirals. - Perhaps a million are within reach of large reflectors;
the spectrum is generally like that of a star cluster.  They are
emphatically non-galactic in distribution, grouped about the galactic
poles, spiral in form.  Space velocities are of the order of 1200 km/sec. 

<p>

Distribution of celestial genera. - With one, and only one, exception, all
known genera of celestial objects show such a distribution with respect to
the plane of our Milky Way, that there can be no reasonable doubt that all
classes, save this one, are integral members of our galaxy.  We see that
all the stars, whether typical, binary, variable, or temporary, even the
rarer types, show this unmistakable concentration toward the galactic
plane.  So also for the diffuse and the planetary nebulae and, though
somewhat less definitely, for the globular star clusters. 

<p>

The one exception is formed by the spirals; grouped about the poles of our
galaxy, they appear to abhor the regions of the greatest star density. 
They seem clearly a class apart. Never found in our Milky Way, there is no
other class of celestial objects with their distinctive characteristics of
form, distribution, and velocity in space. 

<p>

The evidence at present available points strongly to the conclusion that
the spirals are individual galaxies, or island universes, comparable with
our own galaxy in dimensions and in number of component units.  While the
island universe theory of the spirals is not a vital postulate in a theory
of galactic dimensions, nevertheless, because of its indirect bearing on
the question, the arguments in favor of the island universe hypothesis will
be included with those which touch more directly on the probable dimensions
of our own galaxy.

Other theories of galactic dimensions. - From evidence to be referred to
later Dr. Shapley has deduced very great distances for the globular star
clusters, and holds that our galaxy has a diameter comparable with the
distances which he has derived for the clusters, namely, a galactic
diameter of about 300,000 light-years, or at least ten times greater than
formerly accepted.  The postulates of the two theories may be outlined as
follows: 

<p>

Present Theory

<p> 

Our galaxy is probably not more than 30,000 light-years in diameter, and
perhaps 5,000 light-years in thickness 

<p>

The clusters, and all other types of celestial objects except the spirals,
are component parts of our own galactic system. 

<p>

The spirals are a class apart, and not intra- galactic objects.  As island
universes, of the same order of size as our galaxy, they are distant from
us 500,000 to 10,000,000, or more, light years. 

<p>

Shapley's Theory

<p>

The galaxy is approximately 300,000 light- years in diameter, and 30,000 or
more, light- years in thickness. 

<p>

The globular clusters are remote objects, but a part of our own galaxy. 
The most distant cluster is placed about 220,000 light-years away. 

<p>

The spirals are probably of nebulous constitution, and possibly not members
of our own galaxy, driven away in some manner from the regions of greatest
star density. 

<p>

EVIDENCE FURNISHED BY THE MAGNITUDE OF THE STARS

<p>

The "average" star. - It will be of advantage to consider the two theories
of galactic dimensions from the standpoint of the average star.  What is
the "average" or most frequent type of star of our galaxy or of a globular
cluster, and if we can with some probability postulate such an average
star, what bearing will the characteristics of such a star have upon the
question of its average distance from us? 

<p>

No adequate evidence is available that the more distant stars of our galaxy
are in any way essentially different from stars of known distance nearer to
us.  It would seem then that we may safely make such correlations between
the nearer and the more distant stars, en masse.  In such comparisons the
limitations of spectral type must be observed as rigidly as possible, and
results based upon small numbers of stars must be avoided, if possible. 

<p>

Many investigations notably Shapley's studies of the colors of stars in the
globular clusters, and Fath's integrated spectra of these objects and of
the Milky Way, indicate that the average star of a star cluster or of the
Milky Way will, in the great majority of cases, be somewhat like our Sun in
spectral type, i. e., such an average star will be, in general, between
spectral types F and K. 

<p>

Characteristics of F-K type stars of known distance. - The distances of
stars of type F-K in our own neighborhood have been determined in greater
number, perhaps, than for the stars of any other spectral type, so that the
average absolute magnitude of stars of this type seams fairly well
determined.  There is every reason to believe, however, that our selection
of stars of these or other types for direct distance determinations has not
been a representative one.  Our parallax programs have a tendency to select
stars either of great luminosity or of great space velocity. 

<p>

Kapteyn's values for the average absolute magnitudes of the stars of the
various spectral types are as follows: 

<p>
<PRE>
               Type           Average
                              Abs. Magn.
               B5             +1.6
               A5             +3.4
               F5             +7
               G5             +10
               K5             +13
               M              +15
</PRE>
<p>

The same investigator's most recent luminosity-frequency curve places
the maximum of frequency of the stars in general, taking all the spectral
types together, at absolute magnitude +7.7. 

<p>

A recent tabulation of about five hundred modern photographically
determined parallaxes places with average absolute magnitude of stars of
type F-K at about +4.5. 

<p>

The average absolute magnitude of five hundred stars of spectral types F to
M is close to +4, as determined spectroscopically by Adams. 

<p>

It seems certain that the two last values of the average absolute magnitude
are too low, that is, - indicate too high an average luminosity, due to the
omission from our parallax programs of the intrinsically fainter stars. 
The absolute magnitudes of the dwarf stars are, in general, fairly
accurately determined; the absolute magnitudes of many of the giant stars
depend upon small and uncertain parallaxes.  In view of these facts we may
somewhat tentatively take the average absolute magnitude of F-K stars of
known distance as not brighter than +6; some investigators would prefer a
value of +7 or +8. 

<p>

Comparison of Milky Way stars with the "average" stars. - We may take,
without serious error, the distances of 10,000 and 100,000 light-years
respectively, as representing the distance in the two theories from our
point in space to the central line of the Milky Way structure.  Then the
following short table may be prepared: <br>

<PRE>
______________________________________________________________________________
     Apparent       Corresponding absolute magnitudes for distances of, -
     magnitudes               10,000 light-years       100,000 light-years

     14                       +1.6                -3.4
     16                       +3.6                -1.4

______________________________________________________________________________
</PRE>

<p>

It will be seen from the above table that the stars of apparent magnitudes
16 to 20, observed in our Milky Way structure in such great numbers, and,
from their spectrum, believed to be predominantly F-K in type, are of
essentially the same absolute luminosity as known nearer stars of these
types, if assumed to be at the average distance of 10,000 light-years.  The
greater value postulated for the galactic dimensions requires, on the other
hand, an enormous proportion of giant stars. 

<p>

Proportion of giant stars among stars of known distance.- All existing
evidence indicates that the proportion of giant stars in a given region of
space is very small.  As fairly representative of several investigations we
may quote Schouten's results, in which he derives an average stellar
density of 166,000 stars in a cube 500 light-years on a side, the
distribution in absolute magnitude being as follows: 

<p>

<PRE>
______________________________________________________________________________

     +1 to +5            26800                         16
     +5 to +10           138600                   83
______________________________________________________________________________
</PRE>
<p>

Comparison of the stars of the globular clusters with the "average" star.-
From a somewhat cursory study of the negatives of ten representative
globular clusters I estimate the average apparent visual magnitude of all
the stars in these clusters as in the neighborhood of the eighteenth.  More
powerful instruments may eventually indicate a somewhat fainter mean value,
but it does not seem probable that this value is as much as two magnitudes
in error.  We then have:  <br>

<PRE>
______________________________________________________________________________
     Apparent       Corresponding absolute magnitudes for distances of, -
     magnitudes               10,000 light-years       100,000 light-years
______________________________________________________________________________
     18                       +5.6                +0.6
______________________________________________________________________________
</PRE>
<p>

Here again we see that the average F-K star of a cluster, if assumed to be
at a distance of 10,000 light-years, has an average luminosity about the
same as that found for known nearer stars of this type.  The greater
average distance of 100,000 light-years requires a proportion of giant
stars enormously greater than is found in those regions of our galaxy of
which we have fairly definite distance data. 

<p>

While it is not impossible that the clusters are exceptional regions of
space and that, with a tremendous spatial concentration of suns, there
exists also a unique concentration of giant stars, the hypothesis that
cluster stars are, on the whole, like those of known distance seems
inherently the more probable. 

<p>

It would appear, also, that galactic dimensions deduced from correlations
between large numbers of what we may term average stars must take
precedence over values found from small numbers of exceptional objects, and
that, where deductions disagree, we have a right to demand that a theory of
galactic dimensions based upon the exceptional object of class shall not
fail to give an adequate explanation of the usual object or class. 

<p>

The evidence for greater galactic dimensions. - The arguments for a much
larger diameter for our galaxy than that hitherto held, and the objections
which have been raised against the island universe theory of the spirals
rest mainly upon the great distances which have been deduced for the
globular star clusters. 

<p>

I am unable to accept the thesis that the globular clusters are at
distances of the order of 100,000 light-years, feeling that much more
evidence is needed on this point before it will be justifiable to assume
that the cluster stars are predominantly giants rather than average stars. 
I am also influenced, perhaps unduly, by certain fundamental uncertainties
in the data employed.  The limitations of space available for the
publication of this portion of the discussion unfortunately prevents a full
treatment of the evidence.  In calling attention to some of the
uncertainties in the basal data, I must disclaim any spirit of captious
criticism, and take this occasion to express my respect to Dr. Shapley's
point of view, and my high appreciation of the extremely valuable work
which he has done on the clusters.  I am willing to accept correlations
between large masses of stellar data, whether of magnitudes, radial
velocities, or proper motions, but I feel that the dispersion in stellar
characteristics is too large to permit the use of limited amounts of any
sort of data, particularly when such data is of the same order as the
probable errors of the methods of observation. 

<p>

The deductions as to the very great distances of the globular clusters
rest, in the final analysis, upon three lines of evidence: 

<p>

1. Determination of the relative distances of the clusters on the
assumption that they are objects of the same order of actual size. 

<p>

2. Determination of the absolute distances of the clusters through
correlations between Cepheid variable stars in the clusters and in our
galaxy. 

<p>

3. Determination of the absolute distances of the clusters through a
comparison of their brightest stars with the intrinsically brightest stars
of our galaxy. 

<p>

Of these three methods, the second is given most weight by Shapley.

<p>

It seems reasonable to assume that the globular clusters are of the same
order of actual size, and that from their apparent diameters the relative
distances may be determined.  The writer would not, however, place undue
emphasis upon this relation.  There would seem to be no good reason why
there may not exist among these objects a reasonable amount of difference
in actual size, say from three- to five-fold, differences which would not
prevent them being regarded as of the same order of size, but which would
introduce considerable uncertainty into the estimates of relative distance.

<p>

The evidence from Cepheid variable stars. - This portion of Shapley's
theory rests upon the following three hypotheses or lines of evidence: 

<p>

A. That there is a close coordination between absolute magnitude and length
of period for the Cepheid variables of our galaxy, similar to the relation
discovered by Miss Leavitt among Cepheids of the Smaller Magellanic Cloud. 

<p>

B. That, if of identical periods, Cepheids anywhere in the universe have
identical absolute magnitudes. 

<p>

C. This coordination of absolute magnitude and length of period for
galactic Cepheids, the derivation of the absolute scale for their distances
and the distances of the clusters, and, combined with A) and B), the
deductions therefrom as to the much greater dimensions of our galaxy,
depend almost entirely upon the sized and the internal relationships of the
proper motions of eleven Cepheid variables. 

<p>

Under the first heading, it will be seen later that the actual evidence for
such a coordination among galactic Cepheids is very weak.  provided that
the Smaller Magellanic Cloud is not in some way a unique region of space,
the behavior of the Cepheid variables in this Cloud is, through analogy,
perhaps the strongest argument for postulating a similar phenomenon among
Cepheid variables of our galaxy. 

<p>

Unfortunately there is a large dispersion in practically all the
characteristics of the stars. That the Cepheids lack a reasonable amount of
such dispersion is contrary to all experience for the stars in general. 
There are many who will regard the assumption made under B) above as a
rather drastic one. 

<p>

If we tabulate the proper motions of these eleven Cepheids, as given by
Boss, and their probable errors as well, it will be seen that the average
proper motion of these eleven stars is of the order of one second of arc
per century in either coordinate; that the average probable error is nearly
half this amount, and that the probable errors of half of these twenty-two
coordinates may well be described as of the same size as the corresponding
proper motions. 

<p>

Illustrations bearing on the uncertainty of proper motions of the order of
0".01 per year might be multiplied at great length.  The fundamental and
unavoidable errors in our star positions, the probable errors of meridian
observations, the uncertainty in the adopted value of the constant of
precession, the uncertainties introduced by the systematic corrections
applied to different catalogues, all have comparatively little effect when
use is made of proper motions as large as ten seconds or arc per century. 
Proper motions as small as one second of arc per century are, however,
still highly uncertain quantities, entirely aside from the question of the
possible existence of systematic errors.  As an illustration of the
differences in such minute proper motions as derived by various
authorities, the proper motions of three of the best determined of this
list of eleven Cepheids, as determined by Auwers, are in different
quadrants for those derived by Boss. 

<p>

There seems no good reason why the smaller coordinates of this list of
twenty-two may not eventually prove to be different by once or twice their
present magnitude, with occasional changes of sign.  So small an amount of
presumably uncertain data is insufficient to determine the scale of our
galaxy, and many will prefer to wait for additional material before
accepting such evidence as conclusive. 

<p>

In view of:

<p>

1. The known uncertainties of small proper motions, and,

<p>

2. The known magnitude of the purely random motions of the stars, the
determination of individual parallaxes from individual proper motions can
never give results of value, though the average distances secured by such
methods of correlation from large numbers of stars are apparently
trustworthy.  The method can not be regarded as a valid one, and this
applies whether the proper motions are very small or are of appreciable
size. 

<p>

As far as the galactic Cepheids are concerned, Shapley's curve of
coordination between absolute magnitude and length of period, though found
through the mean absolute magnitude of the group of eleven, rests in
reality upon individual parallaxes determined from individual proper
motions, as may be verified by comparing his values for the parallax of
these eleven stars with [1] the values found directly from the upsilon
component of the proper motion (namely, - that component which is parallel
to the Sun's motion) and the solar motion.  The differences in the two sets
of values, 0".0002 in the mean, arise from the rather elaborate system of
weighting employed. 

<p>

[1: Mt. Wilson Contr. No. 151, Table V.]

<p>

The final test of a functional relation is the agreement obtained when
applied to similar data not originally employed in deducing the relation. 
We must be ready to allow some measure of deviation in such a test, but
when a considerable proportion of the other available data fails to agree
within a reasonable amount, we shall be justified in withholding our
decision. 

<p>

If the curve of correlation deduced by Shapley for galactic Cepheids is
correct in both its absolute and relative scale, and if it is possible to
determine individual distances from the individual proper motions, the
curve of correlation, using the same method as far as the proper motions
are concerned (the validity of which I do not admit), should fit fairly
well with other available proper motion and parallax data.  The directly
determined parallaxes are known for five of this group of eleven, and for
five other Cepheids.  There are, in addition, twenty-six other Cepheids or
which proper motions have been determined.  One of these was omitted by
Shapley because of irregularity of period, one for irregularity of the
light curve, two because the proper motions were deemed of insufficient
accuracy, two because the proper motions are anomalously large; the proper
motions of the others have been recently investigated at the Dudley
Observatory, but have less weight than those of the eleven Cepheids used by
Shapley.

[Text - processor's editor's note: Technical limitations may have caused
the figure cited in Dr. Curtis' text not to be reproduced in this version. 
The figure caption is included however, and it is believed that the line of
argument is clear.] 

<p>
     
Fig. 1. - Agreement of other data with the luminosity - period correlation
curve.  Absolute magnitudes calculated from the upsilon component of the
proper motion are indicated by circles; the eleven employed by Shapley are
marked with a bar.  Blackdots represent directly determined parallaxes. 
The arrows attached to the circles at the upper edge of the diagram
indicate that either the parallax or the upsilon component of the proper
motion is negative, and the absolute magnitude indeterminate in
consequence. 

<p>

In Figure 1 the absolute magnitudes are plotted against the logarithm of
the period; the curve is taken from Mt. Wilson Contr. No. 151, and is that
finally adopted by Shapley after the introduction of about twelve Cepheids
of long period in clusters, twenty-five from the Smaller Magellanic Cloud,
and a large number of short period cluster-type variables in clusters with
periods less than a day, which have little effect on the general shape of
the curve.  The barred circles represent the eleven galactic Cepheids
employed by Shapley, the black dots those Cepheids for which parallaxes
have been determined, while the open circles indicate variables for which
proper motions have since become available, or not employed originally by
Shapley.  For the stars at the upper edge of the diagram, the attached
arrows indicate that either the parallax, or the upsilon component of the
proper motion is negative, so that the absolute magnitude is indeterminate,
and may be anything from infinity down. 

<p>

From the above it would seem that available observational data lend little
support to the fact of a period-luminosity relation among galactic
Cepheids.  In view of the large discrepancies shown by other members of the
group when plotted on this curve, it would seem wiser to wait for
additional evidence as to proper motion, radial velocity, and, if possible,
parallax, before entire confidence can be placed in the hypothesis that the
Cepheids and cluster-type variables are invariably super-giants in absolute
luminosity. 

<p>

Argument from the intrinsically brightest stars. - If the
luminosity-frequency law is the same for the stars of the globular clusters
as for our galaxy, it should be possible to correlate the intrinsically
brightest stars of both regions and thus determine cluster distances.  It
would seem, a priori, that the brighter stars of the clusters must be
giants, or at least approach that type, if the stars of the clusters are
like the general run of stars.  Through the application of a spectroscopic
method Shapley has found that the spectra of the brighter stars in clusters
resemble the spectra of galactic giant stars, a method which should be
exceedingly useful after sufficient tests have been made to make sure that
in this phenomenon, as is unfortunately the case in practically all stellar
characteristics, there is not a large dispersion, and also whether slight
differences in spectral type may at all materially affect the deductions. 

<p>

The average "giant" star. - Determining the distance of Messier 3 from the
variable stars which it contains, Shapley then derives absolute magnitude
-1.5 as the mean luminosity of the twenty-five brightest stars in this
cluster.  From this mean value, -1.5, he then determines the distances of
other clusters.  Instead, however, of determining cluster distances of the
order of 100,000 light-years by means of correlations - on a limited number
of Cepheid variables, a small and possibly exceptional class, and from the
distances thus derived deducing that the absolute magnitudes of many of the
brighter stars in the cluster are as great as -3, while a large proportion
are greater than -1, it would seem preferable to begin the line of
reasoning with the attributes of known stars in our neighborhood, and to
proceed from them to the clusters. 

<p>

What is the average absolute magnitude of a galactic giant star?  On this
point there is room for honest difference of opinion, and there will
doubtless be many who will regard the conclusions of this paper as ultra
conservative.  Confining ourselves to existing observational data, there is
no evidence that a group of galactic giants, of average spectral type about
G5, will have a mean absolute magnitude as great as -1.5; it is more
probably in the neighborhood of +1.5, or three absolute magnitudes fainter,
making Shapley's distances four times too large. 

<p>

Russell's suggestion is worth quoting in this connection, written in 1913,
when parallax data were far more limited and less reliable than at present:

<p>

"The giant stars of all the spectral classes appear to be about the same
mean brightness, - averaging a little above absolute magnitude zero, that
is, about a hundred times as bright as the Sun.  Since the stars of this
series . . . have been selectee by apparent brightness, which gives a
strong preference to those of greatest luminosity, the average brightness
of all the giant stars in a given region of space must be less than this,
perhaps considerably so." 

<p>

Some reference has already been made to the doubtful value of parallaxes of
the order of 0".010, and it is upon such small or negative parallaxes that
most of the very great absolute luminosity in present lists depend.  It
seems clear that parallax work should aim at using as faint comparison
stars as possible, and that the corrections applied to reduce relative
parallaxes to absolute parallaxes should be increased very considerably
over what was thought acceptable ten years ago. 

<p>

From a study of the plotted absolute magnitudes by spectral type of about
five hundred modern direct parallaxes, with due regard to the uncertainties
of minute parallaxes, and keeping in mind that most of the giants will be
of types F to M, there seems little reason for placing the average absolute
magnitude of such giant stars as brighter than +2. 

<p>

The average absolute magnitude for the giants in Adams's list of five
hundred spectroscopic parallaxes is +1.1.  The two methods differ most in
the stars of type G, where the spectroscopic method shows a maximum at
+0.6, which is not very evident in the trigonometric parallaxes. 

<p>

In such moving star clusters as the Hyades group, we have thus far
evidently observed only the giant stars of such groups. 

<p>

The mean absolute magnitude of forty-four stars believed to belong to the
Hyades moving cluster is +2.3.  The mean absolute magnitude of the thirteen
stars of types F, G, and K, is +2.4. The mean absolute magnitude of the six
brightest stars is +0.8 (two A5, one G, and three of K type). 

<p>

The Pleiades can not fittingly be compared with such clusters or the
globular clusters; its composition appears entirely different as the
brightest stars average about B5, and only among the faintest stars of the
cluster are there any as late as F in type.  The parallax of this group is
still highly uncertain.  With Schouten's value of 0".037 the mean absolute
magnitude of the six brightest stars is +1.6. 

<p>

With due allowance for the redness of the giants in clusters, Shapley's
mean visual magnitude of the twenty-five brightest stars in twenty-eight
globular clusters is about 14.5.  Then, from the equation given in the
first section of this paper we have, - <br>
+2 = 14.5 + 7.6 - 5 x log distance, <br>
or, log distance = 4.02 = 10,500 light-years as the average distance.

<p>

If we adopt instead the mean value of Adams +1.1, the distance becomes
17,800 light- years. 

<p>

Either value for the average distance of the clusters may be regarded as
satisfactorily close to those postulated for a galaxy of the smaller
dimensions held in this paper, in view of the many uncertainties in the
data.  Either value, also, will give on the same assumptions a distance of
the order of 30,000 light-years for a few of the faintest and apparently
most distant clusters.  I consider it very doubtful whether any cluster is
really so distant as this, but find no difficulty in provisionally
accepting it as a possibility, without thereby necessarily extending the
main structure of the galaxy to such dimensions.  While the clusters seem
concentrated toward our galactic plane, their distribution in longitude is
a most irregular one, nearly all lying in the quadrant between 270 degrees
and 0 degrees.  If the spirals are galaxies of stars, their analogy would
explain the existence of frequent nodules of condensation (globular
clusters) lying well outside of and distinct from the main structure of a
galaxy. 

From the minuteness of their proper motions, most investigators have
deduced vary great luminosities for such stars in our galaxy.  Examining
Kapteyn's values for stars of this type, it will be seen that he finds a
range in absolute magnitude from +3.25 to -5.47.  Dividing the 433 stars of
his lists into two magnitude groups, we have: <br>
<PRE>
Mean abs. Magn. 249 B stars, 
	brighter than abs. magn. 0 		= -1.32
Mean abs. magn. 184 B stars,
	fainter than abs. magn. 0. 		= +0.99
Mean abs. magn. all 				= -0.36
</PRE>

<p>

Either the value for the brighter stars, -1.32, or the mean of all, -0.36,
is over a magnitude brighter than the average absolute magnitude of the
giants of the other spectral types among nearer galactic stars. 

Now this galactic relation is apparently reversed in such clusters as M. 3
or M. 13, where the B-type stars are about three magnitudes fainter than
the brighter K and M stars and about a magnitude fainter than those of G
type.  Supposing that the present very high values for the galactic B-type
stars are correct, if we assume similar luminosity for those in the
clusters we must assign absolute magnitudes of -3 to -6 to the F to M stars
of the clusters, for which we have no certain galactic parallel, with a
distance of perhaps 100,000 light-years.  On the other hand, if the F to M
stars of the cluster are like the brighter stars of these types in the
galaxy, the average absolute magnitude of the B-type stars will be only
about +3, and too low to agree with present values for galactic B stars.  I
prefer to accept the latter alternative in this dilemma, and to believe
that there may exist B-type stars of only two to five times the brightness
of the Sun. 

<p>

While I hold to a theory of galactic dimensions approximately one-tenth of
that supported by Shapley, if does not follow that I maintain this ratio
for any particular cluster distance.  All that I have tried to do is to
show that 10,000 light-years is a reasonable average cluster distance. 
There are so many assumptions and uncertainties involved that I am most
hesitant in attempting to assign a given distance to a given cluster, a
hesitancy which is not diminished by a consideration of the following
estimates of the distance of M. 13 (The Great Cluster in Hercules). <br>
<PRE>
Shapley, 1915, provisional 	100,000 light-years
Charlier, 1916 			170 	light-years
Shapley, 1917 			36,000 	light-years
Shouten, 1918 			4,300 	light-years
Lundmark, 1920 			21,700 	light-years
</PRE>

<p>

It should be stated here that Shapley's earlier estimate was merely a
provisional assumption for computational illustration, but all are based on
modern material, and illustrate the fact that good evidence may frequently
be interpreted in different ways. 

<p>

My own estimate, based on the general considerations outlined earlier in
this paper, would be about 8,000 light-years, and it would appear to me, at
present, that this estimate is perhaps within fifty per cent of the truth.

THE SPIRALS AS EXTERNAL GALAXIES

<p>

The spirals. - If the spirals are island universes it would seem reasonable
and most probable to assign to them dimensions of the same order as our
galaxy.  If, however, their dimensions are as great as 300,000 light-years,
the island universes must be placed at such enormous distances that it
would be necessary to assign what seem impossibly great absolute magnitudes
to the novae which have appeared in these objects.  For this reason the
island universe theory has an indirect bearing on the general subject of
galactic dimensions, though it is, of course, entirely possible to hold
both to the island universe theory and to the belief in the greater
dimensions for our galaxy by making the not improbable assumption that our
own island universe, by chance, happens to be several fold larger than the
average. 

<p>

Some of the arguments against the island universe theory of the spirals
have been cogently put by Shapley, and will be quoted here for reference. 
It is only fir to state that these earlier statements do not adequately
represent Shapley's present point of view, which coincides somewhat more
closely with that held by the writer. 

<p>

"With the plan of the sidereal system here outlined, it appears unlikely
that the spiral nebulae can be considered separate galaxies of stars.  In
addition to the evidence heretofore existing, the following points seem
opposed to the "island universe" theory; (a) the dynamical character of the
region of avoidance; (b) the size of the galaxy; (c) the maximum luminosity
attainable by a star; (d) the increasing commonness of high velocities
among other sidereal objects, particularly those outside the region of
avoidance . . . the cluster work strongly suggests the hypothesis that
spiral nebulae . . . are, however, members of the galactic organization . .
. the novae in spirals may be considered as the engulfing of a star by the
rapidly moving nebulosity. " (Publ. Astron. Soc. of the Pacific, Feb. 1918,
p. 53.) 

<p>

"The recent work on star clusters, in so far as it throws some light on the
probable extent and structure of the galactic system, justifies a brief
reconsideration of the question of external galaxies, and apparently leads
to the rejection of the hypothesis that spiral nebulae should be
interpreted as separate stellar systems. 

<p>

"Let us abandon the comparison with the galaxy and assume an average
distance for the brighter spirals that will give a reasonable maximum
absolute magnitude for the novae (and in a footnote- provisionally, let us
say, of the order of 20,000 light-years).  Further, it is possible to
explain the peculiar distribution of the spirals and their systematic
recession by supposing them repelled in some manner from the galactic
system, which appears to move as a whole through a nebular field of
indefinite extent.  But the possibility of these hypotheses is of course
not proposed as competent evidence against the "island universe" theory. .
. Observation and discussion of the radial velocities, internal motions,
and distribution of the spiral nebulae, of the real and apparent brightness
of novae, of the maximum luminosity of galactic and cluster stars, and
finally of the dimensions of our own galactic system, all seem definitely
to oppose the "island universe" hypothesis of the spiral nebulae . . .
(Publ. Astron. Soc. of the Pacific, Oct. 1919, pp. 261 ff.) 

<p>

The dilemma of the apparent dimensions of the spirals. - In apparent size
the spirals range from a diameter of 2 degrees (Andromeda), to minute
flecks 5", or less, in diameter. 

<p>

They may possibly vary in actual size, roughly in the progression exhibited
by their apparent dimensions. 

<p>

The general principle of approximate equality of size for celestial objects
of the same class seems, however, inherently the more probable, and has
been used in numerous modern investigations, e. g. by Shapley in
determining the relative distances of the clusters. 

<p>

On the principle of approximate equality of actual size:

<p>

As Island Universes

<p>

Their probable distances range from about 500,000 light-years (Andromeda),
to distances of the order 100,000,000 light- years. 

<p>

At 500,000 light-years the Nebula of Andromeda would be 17,000 light-years
in diameter, or of the same order of size as our galaxy. 

<p>

As Galactic Phenomena

<p>

If the Nebulae of Andromeda is but 20,000 light-years distant, the minute
spirals would need to be at distances of the order of 10,000,000
light-years, or far outside the greater dimensions postulated for the
galaxy. 

<p>

If all are galactic objects, equality of size must be abandoned, and the
minute spirals assumed to be a thousand-fold smaller than the largest. 

<p>

The spectrum of the spirals. - 

<p>

As Island Universes

<p>

The spectrum of the average spiral is indistinguishable from that given by
a star cluster. 

<p>

It is approximately F-G in type, and in general character resembles closely
the integrated spectrum of our Milky Way. 

<p>

It is just such a spectrum as would be expected from a vast congeries of
stars. 

<p>

The spectrum of the spirals offers no difficulties on the island universe
theory. 

<p>

As Galactic Phenomena

<p>

If the spirals are intragalactic, we must assume that they are some sort of
finely divided matter, or of gaseous constitution. 

<p>

In either case we have no adequate and actually existing evidence by which
we may explain their spectrum. 

<p>

Many diffuse nebulosities of our galaxy show a bright-line gaseous
spectrum. Others associated with bright stars, agree with their involved
stars in spectrum, and are well explained as a reflection or resonance
effect. 

<p>

Such an explanation seems untenable for most of the spirals. 

<p>

The distribution of the spirals.- The spirals are found in greatest numbers
just where the stars are fewest (at the galactic poles), and not at all
where the stars are most numerous (in the galactic plane).  This fact makes
it difficult, if not impossible, to fit the spirals into any coherent
scheme of stellar evolution, either as a point of origin, or as a final
evolutionary product.  No spiral has as yet been found actually within the
structure of the Milky Way.  This peculiar distribution is admittedly
difficult to explain on any theory.  This factor of distribution in the two
theories may be contrasted as follows: 

<p>

As Island Universes

<p>

It is most improbable that our galaxy should, by mere chance, be placed
about half way between the two great groups of island universes. 

<p>

So many of the edgewise spirals show peripheral rings of occulting matter
that this dark ring may well be the rule rather than the exception. 

<p>

If our galaxy, itself a spiral on the island universe theory, possesses
such a peripheral ring of occulting matter, this would obliterate the
distant spirals in our galactic plane, and would explain the peculiar
apparent distribution of the spirals. 

<p>

There is some evidence for such occulting matter in our galaxy. 

<p>

With regard to the observed excess of velocities of recession, additional
observations may remove this.  Part of the excess may well be due to the
motion of our own galaxy in space.  The Nebula of Andromeda is approaching
us. 

<p>

As Galactic Phenomena

<p>

If the spirals are galactic objects, they must be a class apart from all
other known types; why none in our neighborhood? 

<p>

Their abhorrence of the regions of greatest star density can only be
explained on the hypothesis that they are, in some unknown manner, repelled
by the stars. 

<p>

We know of no force adequate to produce such a repulsion, except perhaps
light-pressure. 

<p>

Why should this repulsion have invariably acted essentially at right angles
to our galactic plane? 

<p>

Why have not some been repelled in the direction of our galactic plane? 

<p>

The repulsion theory, it is true, is given some support by the fact that
most of the spirals observed to date are receding from us. 

<p>

The space velocities of the spirals. - 

<p>

As Island Universes

<p>

The spirals observed to date have the enormous average space velocity of
1200 km/sec. 

<p>

In this velocity factor they stand apart from all galactic objects. 

<p>

Their space velocity is one hundred times that of the galactic diffuse
nebulosities, about thirty times the average velocity of the stars, ten
times that of the planetary nebulae, and five times that of the clusters. 

<p>

Such high speeds seem possible for individual galaxies. 

<p>

Our own galaxy probably has a space velocity, relatively to the system of
the spirals, of several hundred km/sec.  Attempts have been made to derive
this from velocities of the spirals, but are uncertain as yet, as we have
the radial velocities of but thirty spirals. 

<p>

As Galactic Phenomena

<p>

Space velocities of several hundred km/sec. have been found for a few of
the fainter stars. 

<p>

It has been argued that an extension of radial velocities surveys to the
fainter stars would possibly remove the discrepancy between the velocities
of the stars and those of the spirals. 

<p>

This is possible, but does not seem probable.  The faint stars thus far
selected for investigation have been stars of known large proper motions. 
They are exceptional objects through this method of selection, not
representative objects. 

<p>

High space velocities are still the exception, not the rule, for the stars
of our galaxy. 

<p>

Proper motions of the spirals.-  Should the results of the next
quarter-century show close agreement among different observers to the
effect that the annual motions of translation or rotation of the spirals
equal or exceed 0".01 in average value, it would seem that the island
universe theory must be definitely abandoned. 

<p>

A motion of 700 km/sec. across our line of sight will produce the following
annual proper motions: <br>
<PRE>
Distance in light-years 1,000 	10,000 	100,000 	1,000,000
Annual proper motion 	".48 	".048  	".005 		".0005
</PRE>

<p>

The older visual observations of the spirals have so large a probable error
as to be useless for the determinations of proper motions, if small; the
available time interval for photographic determinations is less than
twenty-five years. 

<p>

The first proper motion given above should inevitably have been detected by
either visual or photographic methods, from which it seems clear that the
spirals can not be relatively close to us at the poles of our flattened
galactic disk.  In view of the hazy character of the condensations
measured, I consider the trustworthy determination of the second proper
motion given above impossible by present methods without a much longer time
interval than is at present available; for the third and the fourth, we
should need centuries. 

<p>

New stars in the spirals.- Within the past few years some twenty-seven new
stars have appeared in spirals, sixteen of these in the Nebula of
Andromeda, as against about thirty-five which have appeared in our galaxy
in the last three centuries.  So far as can be judged from such faint
objects, the novae in spirals have a life history similar to that of the
galactic novae, suddenly flashing out, and more slowly, but still
relatively rapidly, sinking again to a luminosity ten thousand-fold less
intense.  Such novae form a strong argument for the island universe theory
and furnish, in addition, a method of determining the approximate distances
of spirals. 

<p>

With all its elements of simplicity and continuity, our universe is too
haphazard in its details to warrant deductions from small numbers of
exceptional objects.  Where no other correlation is available such
deductions must be made with caution, and with a full appreciation of the
uncertainties involved. 

<p>

It seems certain, for instance, that the dispersion of the novae in the
spirals, and probably also in our galaxy, may reach at least ten absolute
magnitudes, as is evidenced by a comparison of S Andromedae with faint
novae found recently in this spiral.  A division into two magnitude classes
is not impossible. 

<p>

Tycho's Nova, to be comparable in absolute magnitude with some recent
galactic novae, could not have been much more than ten light-years distant.
 If as close to us as one hundred light-years it must have been of absolute
magnitude -8 at maximum; if only one thousand light- years away, it would
have been of absolute magnitude -13 at maximum. 

<p>

The distances and absolute magnitudes of but four galactic novae have been
thus far determined; the mean absolute magnitude is -3 at maximum, and +7
at minimum. 

<p>

These mean values, though admittedly resting upon a very limited amount of
data, may be compared with the fainter novae which have appeared in the
Nebula of Andromeda somewhat as follows: where 500,000 light-years is
assumed for this spiral on the island universe hypothesis and, for
comparison, the smaller distance of 20,000 light-years. 
<PRE>

</PRE>
<p>

It will be seen from the above that, at the greater distance of the island
universe theory, the agreement in absolute magnitude is quite good for the
galactic and spiral novae.  If as close as 20,000 light years, however,
these novae must be unlike similar galactic objects, and of unusually low
absolute magnitude at minimum.  Very few stars have thus far been found as
low in luminosity as absolute magnitude +13, corresponding, at this
distance, to apparent magnitude 27. 

<p>

"The simple hypothesis that the novae in spirals represent the running down
of ordinary galactic stars by the rapidly moving nebulosity becomes a
possibility on the basis of distance (i. e., 20,000 light-years) for the
brighter spirals are within the edges of the galactic system (Shapley)." 

<p>

This hypothesis of the origin of the novae in spirals is open to grave
objections.  It involves: 

<p>

1. That the stars thus overtaken are of smaller absolute luminosity than
the faintest thus far observed, with very few exceptions. 

<p>

2. That these faint stars are extraordinarily numerous, a conclusion which
at variance with the results of star counts, which seem to indicate that
there is a marked falling off  in the number of stars below apparent
magnitude 19 or 20. 

<p>

As an illustration of the difficulties which would attend such a
hypothesis, I have made a count of the stars in a number of areas about the
Nebula of Andromeda, including, it is believed, stars at least as faint as
magnitude 19.5, and find a star density, including all magnitudes, of about
6,000 stars per square degree. 

<p>

If no more than 20,000 light-years distant this spiral will lie 7,000
light-years from the plane of the Milky Way, and if moving at the rate of
300 km/sec., it will sweep through 385 cubic light-years per year. 

<p>

To make the case as favorable as possible for the hypothesis suggested,
assume that none of the 6,000 stars per square degree are as close as
15,000 light-years, but that all are arranged in a stratum extending 5,000
light-years each way from the spiral. 

<p>

Then the Nebula of Andromeda should encounter one of these stars every 520
years. Hence the actual rate at which novae have been found in this spiral
would indicate a star density about two thousand times as great as that
shown by the count; each star would occupy about one square second of arc
on the photographic plate. 

<p>

The spirals as island universes: summary. -

<p>

1. On the theory we avoid the almost insuperable difficulties involved in
an attempt to fit the spirals in any coherent scheme of stellar evolution,
either as a point of origin, or as an evolutionary product. 

<p>

2. On this theory it is unnecessary to attempt to coordinate the tremendous
space velocities of the spirals with those of the average star. 

<p>

3. The spectrum of the spirals is such as would be expected from a galaxy
of stars. 

<p>

4. A spiral structure has been suggested for our own galaxy, and is not
improbable. 

<p>

5. If island universes, the new stars observed in the spirals seem a
natural consequence of their nature as galaxies.  Correlations between the
novae in the spirals and those in our galaxy indicate distances ranging
from perhaps 500,000 light-years in the case of the Nebula of Andromeda, to
10,000,000 or more light-years for the more remote spirals. 

<p>

6. At such distances, these island universes would be of the same order of
size as our own galaxy. 

<p>

7. Very many spirals show evidence of peripheral rings of occulting matter
in their equatorial planes.  Such a phenomenon in our galaxy, regarded as a
spiral, would serve to obliterate the distant spirals in our galactic
plane, and would furnish an adequate explanation of the otherwise
inexplicable distribution of the spirals. 

<p>

There is a unity and an internal agreement in the features of the island
universe theory which appeals very strongly to me.  The evidence with
regard to the dimensions of the galaxy, on both sides, is too uncertain as
yet to permit of any dogmatic pronouncements.  There are many points of
difficultly in either theory of galactic dimensions, and it is doubtless
true that many will prefer to suspend judgement until much additional
evidence is forthcoming.  Until more definite evidence to the contrary is
available, however, I feel that the evidence for the smaller and commonly
accepted galactic dimensions is still the stronger; and commonly accepted
galactic dimensions is still the stronger; and that the postulated diameter
of 300,000 light-years must quite certainly be divided by five and perhaps
by ten. 

<p>

I hold, therefore, to the belief that the galaxy is probably not more than
30,000 light-years in diameter; that the spirals are not intra-galactic
objects but island universes, like our own galaxy, and that the spirals, as
external galaxies, indicate to us a greater universe into which we may
penetrate to distances of ten million to a hundred million light-years.
