<span class="textbd">In the fourth article of Lydia Lousteaux's series of interviews with people involved in the wide field of astronomy, she interviews Ms. Brenda Culbertson: Observatory and Planetarium Coordinator for the Department of Physics and
Astronomy at the Washburn University of Topeka, Kansas, USA.
</span>
<br><br>
<span class="text">
<p>
Ms. Culbertson also holds the distinguished honor of "Astronomer of the Year" for 1991 and 1994 by Northeast Kansas Amateur Astronomer's League. (<a href="http://www.nekaal.org" class="nav2">www.nekaal.org</a>)  She designed the first Beginning Astronomer Field School for the Nebraska Star Party (NSP)(<a href="http://www.nebraskastarparty.org/" class="nav2">www.nebraskastarparty.org</a>) a few years ago, and taught there the first year. She was the keynote speaker during the 2001 NSP on the subject of prehistoric and early historic observing methods. She is also a published writer and photographer, and has degrees in natural sciences and mathematics with an emphasis in physics and mass media with print media emphasis. Ms. Culbertson is currently working on a Masters' of Liberal Studies with a concentration in native american starlore.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br> Ms. Culbertson, what piqued your interest in Astronomy? How did you begin to observe?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">BC:</span><br> 
"I do consider myself to be an astronomer, even though I do not have a Ph.D. in the field. My interest in astronomy began during the years that I was a child. Very few people had air conditioning. My family had none, and we would sleep
outside in the summer. As I would lie under the summer skies, I would search the Heavens and watch the events
going on there. That was when I knew I was called to the night sky."
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Ms. Culbertson wrote her first published piece for a school assignment, when she was around the age
of 12. Her teacher sent it to the local newspaper. This poem follows:<br>
"The sunset I saw was beautiful,<br>
 It wasn't bright, but it wasn't dull.<br>
 The colors I saw were red, bright red<br>
 And the orange didn't look so dead.<br>
 The pink was soft, as soft as sand --<br>
 I wanted to hold it right in my hand.<br>
 The blue was gay and the purple was, too,<br>
 I wanted to keep it -there wasn't a thing I could do.<br>
 It went away and the night came through."<br>
 </p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">BC:</span><br>  
"I haven't read that one for a very long time. It still holds meaning for me. Going through high school was not very fun since girls were supposed to take domestic courses instead of science and math, so I did not quite fit in with the other girls. I did not like talking about boys, clothes, or dating. I wanted to discuss space flight, exploration, and that type of thing. Some of my high school friends called me "professor" and encouraged me to keep up with my studies on my own. A mathematics teacher helped me by allowing me to take math early in my coursework. I would have passed my older brother if
I had continued, and that was not quite acceptable, so I left off before getting into calculus."
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br> 
Ms. Culbertson, can you tell me please how easy it was for you to become the Observatory and Planetarium Coordinator? How long have you held this position?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">BC:</span><br>
"The college years came very late for me. I did not have the funding to pay for tuition until I was older. I went to Washburn University, Topeka, Kansas, and studied accounting, which was something I could make a living doing had I kept with
it, which I did not. I was bored with accounting, so I left the School of Business and headed to the Natural Sciences and Astronomy. I had taken so many astronomy classes, I was offered a position with the Department of Physics and Astronomy conducting planetarium programs and assisting in the observatory.  The faculty in the Department of Physics and Astronomy came to trust my work and depended upon me to conduct most of the planetarium tours as a student assistant until I graduated the first time.
</p>
<p>
After I obtained my first degree, I obtained a position with the State of Kansas as a member of the archaeological dig crew at some point in time between my college years. My favorite sites were the prehistoric Native American dwellings. I had found my second calling before long, and I worked at this position until government funding disappeared. At that time I went back to school studying Mass Media. Mass Media was fun, although I was the odd duck since 
I had a science background. The fun part of going through the coursework was when we were assigned to write articles for publication. The topic I almost always chose was astronomy, and almost every article I wrote was published somewhere. None of the faculty with the mass media department understood what I was writing about. I could have written anything and they
would not have known if any of it was accurate.
</p>
<p>
While working on this, my second degree, I went back to work in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Washburn University as a student assistant conducting planetarium programs and open house viewing. I had no problem with being rehired for the position. When it came time for me to go away to graduate school, I was offered a staff position at Washburn University to run the planetarium and Crane Observatory to keep me. I have been there since. (I believe this was in 1999.)  My position includes designing and implementing planetarium programs, and training assistants. I have public viewing sessions in Crane Observatory one night a week most weeks during the spring and fall semesters as well as special event viewing. 
I recall one total lunar eclipse (January of 2000, I believe) when over 300 people came to Crane Observatory to look through the telescope. Although they could have stayed home and looked through their windows, they preferred to come in subfreezing temperatures to look through the telescope.
</p>
<p>
Our telescope at Crane Observatory is a prize to have. It is a Warner and Swasey refracting telescope with a John Brashear Lens. The lens has an effective aperture of a bit over 11 inches (slightly over 28 cm). The telescope and lens was made in late 1889 and came to Washburn University in 1903. There is a very long history behind the telescope. I believe it is one of the last of its kind still open for public viewing. It has nearly all its original components and works perfectly. Two feature articles I wrote were about the telescope and refurbishing it. One article, with photos, went to the Antique Telescope Society journal, the other article, with photos, went to Mercury (magazine). (These articles are available on request.)
</p>
<p> 
The observatory has a special group of regular observers who come frequently. One young woman, Courtney Hale, is a teenager who was recently declared one of the top 10 young astronomers in the country. I am known for putting people to work if they show up during Crane Observatory Open Houses enough times, and Courtney has been showing up over two years."
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Whereas the telescope in Crane Observatory is in good condition, Ms. Culbertson explains the URGENT need for funds for the projector she uses for planetarium programs.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">BC:</span><br>
"The planetarium we use is about 40 years old. We have $65,000 of the $200,000 needed to purchase what we desire to use. I'm not sure how much longer the old one will be of use. Now, about all we can use are the star projections. Other components are either missing or are burned out and can no longer be repaired. Besides running the planetarium and Crane Observatory at Washburn University, I like to keep myself viewing the real sky. Sometimes I will invite friends to my house to observe with me from my home built observatory, but often it will be just Mike, my husband, and me."
</p>
<p> 
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br> 
One may view Ms. Culbertson's webpage at: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ksstargazr/" class="nav2">http://www.geocities.com/ksstargazr/</a>. She states it may not be up to date due to her busy schedule, yet still has many objects there worth seeing. In addition to Ms. Culbertson's webpage you may read her articles in The American Astronomer,the newsletter for the American Association of Amateur Astronomers (AAAA), of which she is Assistant
Editor, at <a href="http://www.corvus.com" class="nav2">www.corvus.com</a>. In addition to multiple links to just about everything "Astronomy", The American Astronomer has her observing challenges, and the NKAAL newsletter has some short observing reports she often submits. Ms. Culbertson also has had photographs and reports published in Astronomy Magazine and Sky and Telescope in the past.  At this time she is "too busy with my masters' project to devote very much time to writing, although one of my current master's projects should be publishable in a month or two. She re-drew some of the constellations in accordance with the Native American star lore.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">BC:</span><br> 
"The phrase, 'If you build it they will come' applies to astronomy conventions as
well as ball fields. I am coordinating a convention June 6-9, 2002, to be held on the Washburn University campus. This one is co-sponsored between Washburn University and the American Association of Amateur Astronomers.  Dr. Paul Butler is our main presenter, and he will be talking about extrasolar planets."
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br> 
What is the one thing you would like to do in the future involving astronomy?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">BC:</span><br>
"One thing I would like to do is to go to the Moon and observe from there. Other than
that, I feel I have succeeded in the field of astronomy."
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br> 
Sometimes women feel left out in some areas of science, did you ever experience this feeling during your studies and at work?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">BC:</span><br> 
"Being a woman in the male dominated field? I have found no more difficulties with that
than with any other area of life. I think women are harder on other women than men are. It's a shame, too, because there is enough space for everyone."
