                inaccessible.</i></h4><P><hr>
                The U.S. Department of Energy faces environmental remediation and waste
                management problems resulting from over 50 years of nuclear weapons production. 
                More than 10,500 individual hazardous-substance-release sites have been identified
                -- sites that must be safely managed until treatment and disposal options mature.
                <p> 
                The volume, extent, broad distribution, and complexity of DOE's contaminated soils
                and groundwater pose a unique and formidable challenge: to develop scientifically
                sound characterization, remediation, performance assessment, and long-term
                monitoring technologies that are cost-effective and result in acceptable risk to
                human health and the environment. <i>In situ</i> approaches to restoration and
                containment, including bioremediation, are methods of choice over excavation and pump-and-treat because much of the contamination is widely dispersed in the environment, is
                present in relatively dilute concentration, or is otherwise inaccessible because of its
                depth or its location beneath structures.<p> 
                Environmental restoration is complicated by the diversity of subsurface
                environments at contaminated sites across the DOE complex <a href =
                "#footnote"><i>footnote </i></a>.   These sites are located in arid, non-arid, cold,
                and hot climates and include a diversity of geological settings and depositional
                environments with unique conditions that must be understood and managed for
                bioremediation or other restoration methods to be effective.  In addition, DOE's
                history
                of
                developing, manufacturing, and managing nuclear materials and weapons resulted in
                environmental contamination with complex and exotic mixtures of compounds. 
                Management practices over the 50-year period resulted from direct disposal of
                wastes into cribs and trenches or by deep injection and indirect contamination
                following the loss of integrity of landfills and leaking underground storage tanks
                (Fig. 2).  The costs associated with remediating many of DOE's largest plumes of
                contaminated groundwater and sediments have not been determined, but estimates
                to clean up DOE's contaminant soils, sediments, and groundwater range from tens
                to hundreds of billions of dollars (DOE, 1995).<p> 
                <hr><h4><i>More than half of the DOE sites are contaminated with mixtures of
                two or more compound classes.</i></h4><P><hr>
                DOE created the Office of Environmental Management (OEM) in response to legal
                and ethical requirements to resolve this legacy of environmental contamination at
                130 DOE sites.  OEM's major responsibilities include waste management,
                environmental restoration, and relevant technology development. DOE must
                overcome myriad technical challenges to enable efficient waste management and
                environmental restoration at its sites.  Scientific breakthroughs and technology
                development are important to enable implementation of cost-effective technologies
                that can meet the performance standards.  OEM has implemented a new
                management approach that is designed to ensure that DOE's environmental R&D
                programs remain focused on OEM's most pressing remediation and waste
                management needs (DOE, 1994).  Five major remediation and waste management
                focus areas have already been identified:<p> 
                <menu>
                o    Contaminant plume containment and remediation.<p>
                o    Mixed-waste characterization, treatment, and disposal.<p>
                o    High-level waste tank remediation.<p>
                o    Landfill stabilization.<p>
                o    Facility transitioning, decommissioning, and final disposition.<p>
                </menu>
                The NABIR program will include leaders from the contaminant plume containment,
                remediation, and landfill focus areas in an advisory capacity.  It will coordinate its
                efforts to ensure the two-way transfer of information and knowledge.<p>
                Classes of chemical contaminants present in sediments and groundwater at more
                than half of all DOE facilities include fuel hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons,
                metals, and radionuclides.  Compound classes most frequently detected at DOE sites
                are metals and chlorinated hydrocarbons, radionuclides, anions, fuel <p>
                
                
                                hydrocarbons, and ketones.  Organic acids, phthalates, explosives, alkyl phosphates,
                complexing agents (i.e., EDTA, DTPA, and NTA), and pesticides are also
                significant contaminants at individual sites.  More than half of the DOE sites
                evaluated by Riley et al. (1992) were contaminated with mixtures of two or more
                compound classes.  The most common mixtures reported were metals and
                radionuclides.  Co-disposal mixtures of compounds has resulted in modified
                transport and toxicity properties that can increase ecological or health risk.  For
                example, complexation with ligands enhances the mobility of metals and
                radionuclides, alters behavior at mineral surfaces, and affects availability to
                microorganisms.<p>

                <hr><h4><i>Successful </i>In situ <i>treatment of contaminant mixtures in diverse
                settings
                requires
                an
                understanding of the interrelation of the physical, chemical, and biological processes

                Successful treatment of contaminant mixtures in diverse settings by <I>in situ</I>
                biological, chemical, or physical methods or a combination of these methods
                requires a fundamental understanding of the interactions and interdependence of
                physical, chemical, and biological processes that effect chemical reactions. 
                Developing this basic understanding, as it applies to bioremediation technology
                development and performance assessment, requires integrated, interdisciplinary
                research.<p>
                Acquisition of this knowledge base must be accompanied by parallel advances in the
                development of effective performance assessments and advanced computational
                methods, identification of acceptable cleanup end points, and research in ethical,
                legal, and social impacts (ELSI).  Researchers must identify and address
                stakeholders' issues and coordinate their efforts with other federal agencies and
                industry.<p>
                A full understanding of the natural processes involved in natural and accelerated
                bioremediation depends on the ability to build on laboratory experimentation by
                directly investigating phenomena in the field and conducting field experiments. 
                Many of the scientific and technical results from a bioremediation R&D program on
                <I>in situ</I> treatment will also be applicable to waste management and
                minimization efforts such as the design and operation of bioreactors to treat a
                broad spectrum of dilute and concentrated waste streams from ongoing and past
                DOE operations.<p>
