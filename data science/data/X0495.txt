Markus Muhlhauser, HuntGuide.com ProStaff</font><br>
</h2>

<p><font color="#003500">These days it seems folks use the word &quot;super&quot; much too
flippantly. Super Market, Super Model, Super Glue, Super Highway, super this and super
that&#133; it&#146;s enough to make you loose sight of what the word really means. So a
few weeks ago when speaking on the phone with Grady Weeks, co-owner of Blackhawk Farms, I
was told that his new ranch was &quot;Home of the &#145;Super Bucks&#146;&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font color="#003500">Now, given my somewhat callused view of society&#146;s abuse of
the word &quot;super&quot;, I almost immediately wrote it off as hype. Less than a week
later, I found myself at Blackhawk and its beautiful Mississippi River bottoms - and
discovered how wrong I had been!</font></p>

    <small>The 10,000 square foot lodge at Blackhawk, constructed from Cypress and complete
    with walk-in cooler, skinning room and working elevator is hands down the nicest lodge
    ever visited by the author. </small></font></td>

<p><font color="#003500">The trip started off with one of the worst airplane rides I could
recall. I knew we were in bad shape when the pilot used the words &quot;think&quot; and
&quot;might&quot; in his announcement on approach into Baton Rouge.</font></p>

<p><font color="#003500">I was picked up at the airport by Kenny Wood, Jr., (son of
Grady&#146;s partner, Kenny Wood, Sr.) and we had fun talking about our hunting and
fishing experiences, making the one hour and forty-five minute drive to Blackhawk seem
like only minutes. All this despite tumultuous thunderstorms.</font></p>

<p><font color="#003500">Greeted at the lodge by Kenny, Grady and a juicy steak - I felt
at home immediately! That night before turning in, I learned more about
Blackhawk.</font></p>

<p><font color="#003500">About 8 years ago Ken and Grady purchased approximately 4,000
acres of lush, thick river bottom land. Shortly after doing so, they fenced a large
portion of it, in the hopes of creating ideal Whitetail habitat. To that end, no expenses
was spared. Top biologists were brought in to assess the animals and land. Their on-going
recommendations for proper management of the herd were implemented in the shape of proper
food plots, outstanding terrain, large expanses of land, and above all, trophy management.
It became apparent to me that Ken and Grady are true Whitetail <em>fanatics</em>, and have
not only a desire to hunt monster whitetails, but who also cherish the animal and all that
goes with it.</font></p>

<p><font color="#003500">Since the time of development, virtually no hunting was allowed
on the property. The owners recently built a 10,000+ sq. foot lodge meticulously crafted
from Cyprus trees harvested from the surrounding land. In addition to the lodge, four
small cabins were built adjacent to the lodge providing private living quarters for
hunters during their stay. Each has its own porch overlooking a bass pond complete with
gazebo. I can say without hesitation that I found the lodge, as well as the matching cabin
I stayed in to be the finest accommodations I have every been privy to while hunting. The
fact that I was in the company of such fine people, with a sense of humor that had us all
in stitches throughout my stay, made it even that much more enjoyable.</font></p>

<p><font color="#003500">Enough about the lodge and onto the good stuff - hunting! Being
only on a 2 day hunt to review the operation (Blackhawk hunts generally include four days
of hunting), I opted to bowhunt the first day, and try my luck with the rifle on the last
day should I have not succeeded with the bow. The first morning, I followed Grady through
the thick woods and then perched myself upon a 16 foot ladder stand. Grady was a few trees
over, armed with a video camera should any deer cooperate with us.</font></p>

<p><font color="#003500">Within the first hour of daylight, a small 6 pointer showed up.
While too small to even think about, I had fun watching him browse on nearby plants as he
made his way through the natural funnel we watched over.</font></p>

<p><font color="#003500">A while later a nice 8-pointer showed up, followed by a 10-point.
I was on a management hunt, meaning I was only allowed to harvest a mature 8-point buck,
so when the 10-point came by and presented me with a perfect broadside shot, all I could
do was shake my head. Even though I had not even drawn my trusty Hoyt, it was one of the
finest mornings I had ever had in the woods.</font></p>

<p><font color="#003500">Then came the afternoon. After evaluating the wind, Grady decided
we should try our luck in another stand placed between a bedding area and field. After
sitting for quite some time without a trace of a deer, I caught movement over my left
shoulder. Five does headed toward us and stopped at 20 yards. Just then the wind switched
for a brief second, scattering them. The woods calmed down again and the wind behaved. We
were hoping the incident would not ruin our chances for the rest of the afternoon.</font></p>

<p><font color="#003500">Deer started filtering into the field from the distant side,
along with a couple tremendous bucks which I roughly estimated through my binoculars to be
at least in the 150 class. While they never worked their way over, I did have a nice 8
pointer come to check on some does on the other side of my stand. With the buck closing
fast, Grady gave me a thumbs-up indicating I could attempt to take the buck if the
opportunity would present itself.</font></p>

<p><font color="#003500">Butterflies danced in my stomach as the buck inched closer and
closer. At the present rate it looked as if he would present himself broadside at about 22
yards. I positioned myself, knowing the moment of truth may soon arrive. Just at the time
he was walking into the shooting lane, a button buck entered just behind the buck from the
opposite direction, not allowing for a safe shot. The buck left unharmed.</font></p>

<p><font color="#003500">As the light began to fade, two more bucks appeared including one
I had seen in the nearby funnel earlier that day. Then I was taken off guard. From my left
entered perhaps the biggest buck I have ever encountered up close. With G-2&#146;s and
G-3&#146;s measuring at least 12 inches, this 10-point was a true monster. As the biggest
buck of the day presented a perfect broadside shot at 17 yards - he seemed to know that
he, too was off limits to this hunter!</font></p>

<p><font color="#003500">The second and last morning had all of the makings of a perfect
hunt as I entered into the rifle blind before light with Grady. Based upon what I had seen
the day before on top of the wonderful home video I had viewed, I felt that I should be
able to score on a nice 8 point in the 130 or 140 class. However, as dawn broke a heavy,
heavy fog obscured our view of the field in front of us. Given the weather we sat for
quite some time - with only a few birds providing entertainment.</font></p>

<p><font color="#003500">Finally, coming out of the fog like a ghost, appeared a lone
buck. He made his way slowly across the field. After glassing him over, we counted 8
points, and while not as large as many of other deer in the area Grady felt that by his
age, he should have been at least a 10-pointer. He qualified as a management buck and I
was given the thumbs-up again.</font></p>

<p><font color="#003500">My heart raced as the buck stopped and listened to coyotes
howling in the distance. I estimated the distance at about 120 yards and settled the
crosshairs at which point the 8-pointer turned and walked straight away. My heart sank -
after seeing some 14 bucks the day before, would I go home empty handed?</font></p>

<p><font color="#003500">After a few more yards he turned quartering toward me, and
crosshairs settled on him once again. I gently squeezed the trigger and the 7mm cracked
through the silence of the morning. The buck was ours. What an exciting hunt!</font></p>

<p><font color="#003500">A four wheeler made easy work of getting the deer out of the
woods and back to the lodge. After skinning and butchering the deer, and taking a few
pictures of the magnificent lodge for posterity, it was sadly time to go. I took with me
the knowledge that I had visited somewhere very,very special and I am already looking
forward to many more trips to Blackhawk - true home of the <i>Super</i> Bucks!</font></p>

<p align="left"><strong>Special Note from the Author:<br>
<font color="#003500">I must say that I felt honored to be one of the first hunters
allowed on Blackhawk. (As a matter of fact, they are only officially starting to take
hunters for the coming 1999 season.). I found the operation to be a truly wonderful
hunting experience, surrounded by outstanding people. I have visited and/or researched
quite a few other outfitters featuring a management program and high fence, however,
Blackhawk is the first such outfitter that has met my rather stringent requirements and
endorsement. They provide a true hunting experience, with a large expanse of land, perfect
habitat with&nbsp; no cross-fences or barriers. While not an inexpensive hunt in anyone's
book, Blackhawk provides a rare, quality experience for truly huge Whitetail bucks.</font></strong></p>
