    the South Australian Dressage Championships were held on 11th and 12th of March at the
    Strathalbyn Polo Grounds. It also marked a change in how the competition was run in that
    instead of each dressage club in the Adelaide region taking turns (SADA ran it in both
    1998 and 1999) the EFA Dressage Committee organised this year's event. Both competitors,
    judges and others involved in the event did a great job considering that there were 136
    individual horses entered and both days were very humid and hot with early starts and late
    afternoon finishes. </small></font><p><small><font face="Arial" color="#004000">The Novice
    Champion trophy was won by Leslie Anne Taylor while the Medium Champion trophy was awarded
    to L Wright. Ruth Schneeberger was the Advanced Champion trophy recipient. Wendy Schaeffer
    was probably the busiest yet most unlucky rider with seven placings over the two day
    carnival missing victory on several occasions by very small percentages with her five
    horses. Gillian Rolton entered four horses over the two days for one victory but they
    appear to be up and coming horses as only Endeavour is well known in the top level of
    competition. </font></small></p>
