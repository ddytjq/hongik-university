<!-- PointEdit TYPE="AREA" NAME="area" -->
<p>June 5, 2002<p>Hi,Guys!  Summer Vacation is almost here for everyone.  The Hoop Side would like to congratulate one of the most dynamic basketball classes that has graduated to date from this state of Indiana.  So many athletes secured scholarships from our state.  Congrats!, big guys.<p>

<p>It looks as if the Keith Christmas story is finally coming to a close.  Several schools decided to look into Keith after finding out that he would not be attending Idaho.  Mr. Christmas is one of the better players in the state of Indiana and the university that he will be able to represent will be Middle Tennessee.  We wish Keith the best as he moves on to the next level.  Good Luck, Keith.<p>

<p>The first high school summer season starts for the state of Indiana this summer and Purdue is throwing one of the best team camps.  Five games in one day is a killer.  There are a lot of nice teams involved.  Anderson, Bloomington Red, Illinois Warriors, Gary Wirt, Gary Roosevelt, Gary West Side and a few others.  Close to thirty two teams will vie for respect early around the state.  We at the hoop side really love the fact that it is put up or shut up time year round for the state and possibly some of our teams will be look at as possible national champions.<p>

<p>See you in the gym<p>


<p>5-31-02<p>
<p>Hold Up!!!  What is going on with AAU.  Such hostility? The fiasco between Coach Reamer and Mr. Tisdale.  Wow guys.  Is it that serious that we have to send jabs via the internet and then it was inappropriate to place an address and phone number on the net.  I am discussing the message board comments on Jim Reamer by Reggie Tisdale and then Mr. Jim R's response which by the way was eloquently written.  I have to agree that no kid belongs to any one team and if a guy can persuade a kid to transfer allegience to another team then the kid was not loyal and the coach probably did not have a significant impact on the kid.  You think.<p>

<p>The Cougar Basketball program had two kids who felt that Coach Boyd was not the solution to improving their games so they moved out of the district.  Coach Boyd did not try to block the move.  Lesson learned.  Why would he or anyone else for the matter.  Preaching loyalty but also being intelligent about opportunity is just as important as committment.  If a coach or program can offer a chance for a kid to be exposed then we should be open to that.  the coach and program should understand the kids relationship with the high school coach or mentor.   West Side high school in the past three years have sent more kids to D1 schools or college for that matter because we do our homework.  we work dilegently with schools so that our kids are exposed to the best environments.  Five Star, Prep Star, Future Stars, and then just constant film and correspondence with potential schools open up doors.  It does not hurt to be skilled.<p>

<p>Anyone who is interested in learning the right way to get a kid a scholarwship to a D1, D2, D3, or NAIA can call Coach Ron Dishmon head of recruiting at Gary West Side and Proprietor of Get Me Done College Recruiting Service at 219 944-2147.  Leave a Message.<p>

<p>Get Me Done Recruiting Service offers the best of service in trying to continue your kids career in his or her sport of choice. Ninety-percent success rate to place kid in at least a D1, D2, D3, NAIA, or Prep School. Call now!<p>

<p>See you in the Gym<p>
  


<p>5-30-02<p>
<p>Well, Well, Well, Hoop Fans, the Hoop Side has landed once again.  We have just come back from a trip with Master Yoda.  Yeah, that's right we saw "The Attack of the Clones". It was such a great movie.  I can honestly see that George Lucas is a genuis, and he is getting a chance to see all of his dreams come true.  Go George.  The state of Indiana has finally given our high school teams the chance to be recognized as some of the top teams in the country, by opening up the summer.<p>

<p>EC Central is having a very competitive league during the open period that should prepare a few local teams for the upcoming season.  We will at least be able to see some of the things that need to be corrected.<p>

<p>The Hoop Side feels that the Top Five Programs in the State for the upcoming season goes as follows:

<p>-Pike-with the transfer of Vaden and Gadis, along with Parnell Smith, Justin Cage and Courtney Lee and newcomer to the scene athletic McCoy and then the best point guard and three point shooting guard in the state Barlow and Yates.  They are simply loaded.<p>

<p>-Lafayette Jeff-team made a name for itself.  Team to watch.<p>

<p>-Munster-everyone is returning and the kid Bothwell has game and the heart of a lion.<p>

<p>-Gary Roosevelt-The team has talent compatible to Pike but on the 3A level.  They are clearly one of the best teams in the region.<p>

<p>-Bloomington South-Grant Gibson will be one of the states leading scorers.<p>

<p>See you in the gym<p>

<p>5-24-02<p>
<p>What's up Hoop Fans!  Happy Memorial Day Weekend for everyone.  The Hoop Side is just chilling out and wondering how basketball is going to be since the new rule change.  the high school teams across the state will finally be able to compete with other schools across the country in summer tournaments and leagues.  We may be wrong so don't hold us to it(smile).  We would check with an IHSAA official before doing anything questionable.<p>

<p>Now we wonder how the different AAU programs are going to feel about having some of their guys absent from the program to participate with their high school team. The Hoop Side asked our favorite coach John Boyd of Gary West Side for his insight into the entire shakeup and he had some interesting thoughts on the matter.<p>

<p>Coach Boyd-- I started a lot of my coaching career involved with the AAU system.  I learned quite a bit and it was very interesting.  I personally was never happy with the three players from any particular team condition.  I felt that this gave those three guys the ability to think that they would have preferential treatment and allow an outsider to enter into a kids life and disrupt his ability to respect or think logically.  It also places a heavy burden on the kid to choose sides when it comes to his recruitment.<p> 

<p>I blame no one but the NCAA because instead of allowing the high school coach the ability to oversee the recruitment of a kid, they designate these open periods during the summer when all the vultures are at prey for the ear of the kid.  It is so ironic that whenever an annoucement is made about the kid choosing a college the credit is always given to the kids high school when in some instances the high school coach has never been a part of the process.  The NCAA always talks of limiting the influence but so many people now are making money off of kids.  The top money makers off of kids in the State of Indiana during the AAU period is impressive and very enlightening.  They talk of being Non for profit and then they charge excessive amounts to view the kids in action.  There is also the pimping of kids in regards to if I pick you up then you should take my advice.  Some of these kids have so much baggage before they get to high school it is incredible pressure on a coach.  Too many uneducated, and morally evil people are in charge of AAU programs and the solicitation of children.  At West Side High School you will not and can not influence a kid to make a decision without the advice of the coaching staff (Although we have recently had an incident of tampering it is being adhered to at the present time).  We are trained to offer sound advice on the type of school that our players desire and whether or not that school has the kids major, etc.  Funny huh!  We can "ball" but the kid is in school to be degreed.  We desire that piece of paper that solidifies us as educated men.<p>
<p>The ability of others to influence should result in either the disbandment of AAU or strict regulations of the events(you better watch what you say coach)(smile).  Summer open periods should now be winter open periods and then coaches can be visible at games to bring back crowds for faltering high school programs.  Yeah it would put a burden on the coaches but it would restore the integrity back to the high school coach.  A high school coach is just not needed to recruit a kid anymore, and that is a fact.  I had a very promising idea taken away by an AAU proprietor and he and his group have never shown one ounce of respect or gratitude for the help that me and Raymond Allen bestowed upon that organization.  That organization was never a national qualifier before John Boyd and company made its trek into their lives but it goes to show how people forget where they come from.  It is probalbly to much for those persons to say hey thanks and if we can ever help in any way call us.  They continue to run one of the most successful events in Indiana and I wish them the best but they know that I am aware of the inside working of the organization and their secret is safe with me.<p>
<p>The Cougars Basketball program and many others from Northwest Indiana will one day see the light and organize but now, too many people have chips on their shoulders so we have to see teams that are not as talented as ours in the Southern part of the state beaten by talent that is not comparable to ours.  The Southern kids do not respect the ability of the North but believe me in the years to come they will finally begin to at least respect our ability to BALL!!! I mean the guys even took my slogan "see you in the gym" and adjusted it to "see you on the court", good grief give me a break.<p>

<p>enough said!<p>

<p>See you in the gym<p>

<p>5-16-02<p>
<p>Well, Well,  The saga continues and with the opening of the new Star Wars movie, Attack of the Clones.  It is appropriate to say that the Gary West Side Program has been attacked by clones. (Ha Ha)  Those clones have infiltrated the minds of one of the players at Gary West.  They first advised a player of his caliber to accept a scholarship to the University of Idaho even without an official visit being taken.  Now, the hoop side laughs at this because in the past we might add, most players from Gary West that perform at high levels have always been able to at least secure looks from the major conferences.  Point taken.  During the season we are informed that the head coach from Idaho never attended a Cougar contest or had never seen the player perform.  Point taken.  The mess had already started in coach Boyd's mind because in most cases the head coach always, always will come to see his prospect.  Unfortunately this did not occur and the red flags surfaced within the coaching staff but due to the fact that this relationship was started outside of the West Side family we took a wait and see approach.  As you can see while we wait the problem has taken a major twist.  Now the player who has signed all of a sudden doesn't have a letter of intent and no scholarship.  What is up?  It gets even better. Read this.  The clones then, while all the commotion over the Idaho deal is just getting untangled takes the kid to Hutchinson Community College(Without the acknowledgement from the coach or the common courtesy of telling the coach his intent)and instructs this kid to sign another letter of intent although there is one on the table that has not been denied.  Hey,  I know you are laughing even louder now?  It gets even better.  Hutchinson has never seen the kid play or called the head coach to inquire about the kid.  Some how the clones are influencing coaches across America that they are the contact people in regards to West Side athletes.  The Hoop Side knows coach John Boyd Jr. and he does not operate in this manner.  He may miss deadlines and be hard to contact but he is a standup guy and takes care of his players well being. (smile coach) Now this is the irony in the whole situation.  A decision was made outside of the cougar family and guess what now after the decision fell apart everyone calls Coach Boyd to find out what happened and guess what he doesn't know because he was not informed by the player but more importantly the clones. The hoop side knows that there is animosity and one of the Cougar players was used and instructed to make quick decisions instead of being able to ponder and come to a solid choice that he could live with.  the kid did not know how the recruiting process is and trusted a grownup who constantly tells coaches he has nothing to do with their recruitment and will instruct all coaches to contact the head coach.  the hoop side did respect that statement until we finally found out it was a blatant fib.  Hey, but that is the nature of this business and the hoop side hopes that coaches are aware of the (the clones)AAU coaches and directors that make AAU have a such a shaky image.<p>


<p>AAU is a tremendous experience for a kid but sometimes the people that run the programs have their own agenda.  The Hoop Side started with AAU and got out of it because so many people are making money off of kids and not giving any to players high school programs or kids.  This society has thrived on taking advantage of children and hopefully we can remedy many of the ills in AAU and the NCAA which started this whole mess by not allowing the monetary compensation of its athletes.  Now everyone is in on using kids for monetary gain.  When the NCAA can sign a billion dollar contract and give all of its directors six figure contracts while players call home and have to ask parents for funds.  Even if the NCAA was to just raise the players stipends.  Maybe $1000 or $2000 dollars a month while on scholarship, but that would be to close to right and it would take away from there million dollar contracts.  The Hoop Side hopes that we can all work towards some type of reconciliation and at least make it comfortable for the student athlete.  They never should have to worry about money. The Hoop Side<p>

<p>The Gary West Side State Championship banquet will be held on Monday, May 20, 2002 at Marquette Park Pavilion. Start time 6:00pm.  The speaker will be NCAA Runner-up and Big Ten Champion Head Coach Mike Davis.  Cost $20.<p>

<p>See you in the Gym<p>     

<p>5-13-02<p>
Good day Hoop fans.  The Hoop Side would like to wish all Mother's a Happy Belated Mother's Day.<p>

<p>There has been so much happening.  

<p>5-1-02<p>
Hi, Hoop fans and die hard Hoosiers.  Today is a special day for the Hoop Side.  It is the birthday of the World famous Delphine Boyd.  The Hoop Side's favorite mother.  Happy Birthday Mom.  We definitely love that woman.<p>

<p>The Hoop Side has been moving back and forth trying to get situated for the new summer basketball season.  Team camps are going to be awesome.  The Hoop Side really has to give credit where credit is due.  The IHSAA is really trying to get progressive.  We mean at least they are listening to the majority.  Way to go IHSAA.<p>

<p>The Hoop Side would also like to congratulate Keana Wash for her specialness (is this a word)(smile) Wash is one of a kind, she represents the mentality of a classy young lady and the Gary West Side Basketball Program is proud to be able to have had her as a manager.  Keana is a Gary West Side Basketball Program product and we know that her future is solid.  We at the Hoop Side are happy to have been affiliated with the Manager of the Year Keana Wash.<p>

<p>See you in the Gym<p>

<p>4-28-02<p>
<p>The Hoop Side would like to say that basketball has been ("berry, berry good to us")very fun.  The joy that one gets is to see how students develop mentally, physically and educationally in your system.  Congratulations to all the coaches that continue to do their job at a high level even though the support is not consistent with results.  The line has to be put in place about kids playing adult sports.  Since when have we become so sadistic?  It is insane to say that a kid is ready to be a professional athlete at age 16, and why are we only looking at this from only a physical standpoint.  Who the hell is in charge of these decisions and are we so in a hurry to succeed that we have blindfolded ourselves into realizing that when you give right away we fulfill the greed of another and when that greed clouds our ability to think we have the greatest of problems on hand.<p>

<p>Kids have to develop mentally before they can take on the rigors of the adult livelihood.  We at the Hoop Side can truly understand why youngsters are so disrespectful to adults and why they are treated as if they are on the same plane as their elders.  We are the laughing stocks of the world. Discipline and respect has went right out of the door and it has caused the morals of many to follow right behind.  We are a society that has allowed the people with money to control our minds.  This is in direct correlation with the removal of prayer and absence of spiritual values in peoples lives.  No wonder people can walk up and kill with no justification.  Guns were taboo and children would run from them now they are allowed at a young age to handle weapons that can take out entire cities.  We have caused this situation and all we at the Hoop Side know is that the last time our world was headed in this direction a higher being intercepted the evil with a force that cleansed this world of the ignorance and greed.  We pity the powers that be for not recognizing the slow and methodical destruction of our world.  We at the Hoop Side will pray for all as we continuously fight the evil grip of worldly pleasures instead of understanding the true nature of life and that is LOVE<p>

<p>See you in the Gym<p>


<p>4-17-02<p>
<p>The Hoop Side would like to say Congratulations to all of the members of the 2002 Indiana All-Star team.  Without question this is one of the first teams to be selected with a clear regard for ability and prestige. Each of the members are representative of their distinct communities and are major college recruits.<p>

<p>The Hoop Side must also give credit to the selection committee for having the complete appreciation for the game and respect for the entire state in a show of support for the magnitude of the accomplishment of the West Side Cougars.  The Cougars were rewarded with three selections to bring their total of Indiana All Stars to a Region High of eight.<p>
<p>We must give Mr. Aikman and his selection committee high marks for changing the perception of the North.<p>
 
<p>Thank You.<p>

<p>In this regard the region must show tremendous support for this recognition that the committee has bestowed on our area.  So let's pack up the vehicles and make sure that we are at Conseco in droves for the upcoming Indiana-Kentucky showcase.<p>

<p>4-16-02<p>
<p>The Hoop Side is delighted to be back.  Just as quick as the Cougars have begun celebrating their first state championship and bringing the focus back to Northwest Indiana, another injustice has been dealt to the Northern part of the state. <p>

<p>We at the Hoop Side feel it is our duty to admit the truth.  The truth of the matter is that the Indiana All-Star game continues to function as a political tool and clearly does not recognize the best talent in the state. Clearly the guidelines have to be defined and if paying for an ad or living in Southern Indiana is a part of it then I know of a few families that are willing to move.  It is completely proposterous for a point guard that led his unranked team to a state title and clearly was the best player in the state during the tournament run and had his best game in front of all the powers that be and is receiving a High Major Scholarship to a prestigious Big Ten school and holds a 3.2 G.P.A along with being a National Honor Society Member.  He doesn't make the team.  Who is better.  A kid who had a good summer and is attending Xavier is the states top point guard and how can you decide who is the top in one Sunday workout. Without a doubt a point guard is defined by his ability to lead and by far Gary West Side's point guard was the leader of that team.  Even if Finn is the best how can the Cameron not be second, explain powers that be. I know that we are not going to Kentucky with only one point guard in tow but,of course, we will use a two at the one so that Gary West will not be allowed to have three guys on the prestigious Indiana All-Star team.<p>
<p>We at the Hoop Side believe all gentlemen involved in the selection of these fine young men to be of sound moral standing and without biases especially since we know that at least two members of the selection committee were from Northeast or the Northwest part of the state. You have to have those representatives especially once again due to this states inability to even recognize a team that suited up three D1's in its rankings.  It is obvious that this is not true and we are ashamed to continue to have the wool pulled over our faces up in the Northern region.  How dare the committee feel it is unfair to name three individuals from the same school especially when it is a kid attending a Big Ten school who has the possibility of being a starter because of his leadership capabilities let alone his skill level. How can a guy that has played with two D1's and can defend and lead his team to the mythical state championship in Indiana not be apart.  Well in conservative and i dare say segregated Indiana the good ol' boy network still reins supreme.  We up North know the way Southern Indiana views us and that is why all practices, workouts, and games are located in that region.  Lafayette is not Fort Wayne, or South Bend, and definitely not Northwest Indiana who have not seen a practice or top 40 workout or Junior all-star scrimmage since we have been alive.  I refuse to say like others that the Indiana All-Star experience has lost its luster to Northerners but that is only because we believe in the words of the Director who said, "your attitude will be so important".  Well up North it is the attitude that the southern half displays in regard to the North that continues to hurt our athletes.<p>

<p>See you in the Gym<p>

<p>4-10-02
<p>What it is up Hoop World.  We definitely have got to do something about guys being able to go to the league out of high school and after only two years of college. Now, Now I am a logical person and you can always create an argument for the player, but what about the development of the total individual.  We continue to be a society that fails to enforce rules that make kids better people.  We continue to allow kids to make grownup decisions.  The consequences are grave and we as a nation are blinded by the influx of opportunity to be wealthy.  We refuse to acknowledge the existence of knowledge.  Knowledge is what our generation lacks compared to past generations.  We are a "now" generation and too many people who should not be in control are in control and convincing this now generation to react too soon for their own personal satisfaction.<p>

<p>Does a child know the ins and outs of business, accounting, how to do taxes, how to write a cover letter, how to invest their money, the lustful ways of vultures that prey on the young minds and most of all the inability to read women and their desires whether good or bad, etc.  Okay, I know that everyone will say that I can hire someone to do those things.  Well, what if the people you hire are untrustworthy.  What do you say then,  my dad or mom will oversee.  I am a realist and I know that money is the root of all evil.  A kid graduates from high school and says that it is a great honor to receive a scholarship and I want to graduate.  Yeah right, that kid has no intention on being a team player, and that is what has infested team sports.  We now are a society that glorifies the individual and it has destroyed the team concept.  I am for and against guys leaving early because development must occur before achievement.  A player a student, a business CEO appreciates his art more if he has worked hard and paid dues to reach his plateau.  I am only one voice but the tradgedies continue to mount while the success stories are few.<p>

<p>If you give kids what they want they will take advantage of that situation.  We have as a society condoned the partial development of the mind and it has and will continue to lead to low morals and values the continued disrespect for elders and authority and a generation that is fueled by money, greed and sex.  Where are the values and people with the guts to say no more.<p>

<p>See you in the Gym<p>

<p>4-06-02<p>
<p>The Hoop Side is back and we are delighted to congratulate the Gary, Indiana West Side Cougars on their first state championship in boy's basketball. Go Cougars.  We always felt that you guys could do it.<p>

<p>It was a strange tournament run for the Cougars but the talented and disciplined bunch from Gary withstood ferocious runs from DeKalb in the Semistate, and then the same from a determined Pike team to come out on top.

<p>Christopher Hunter was named the Trester Award winner.<p>
<p>Congratulations Christopher!!!!<p>
<p>Christopher and Brandon Cameron were named to the the first and second team all state Associated Press.<p>

<p>There have been many accolades placed upon this team and they are rightfully deserving of the honors.  

<p>Coach Boyd has definitely with the grace of God kept his word of securing a state championship for Gary West Side.  He is now faced with the task of staying viable.  We will all get to see what he is all about because everything but the kitchen sink(Jorie Peters, Sean Smith, Jon Moore, Chris Buggs)is gone.  We hope that coach boyd has enjoyed the long hair because it will not be there in the fall.  Anyway didn't the guys say they were going to cut those dreds.  (smile)<p>

<p>Everyone along the tournament trek seemed to be fairly surprised at the discipline that the Cougars displayed on and off the court.  this probably was due to the our fans busy schedules and their inability to make it to games.  the Cougars have always been and will be a structured bunch under the guidance of Coach Boyd.  We definitely see a difference in his style of play from past gary west teams and we hope that success continues to flow his way.  He is without a doubt one of the truly hard working coaches for his players.<p>

<p>The Cougars of 2001-2002 have already committed to three barn burners.  Chicago Farragut will play Gary West on its home floor in its season opener. Chicago Crane will also play Gary West.  The huge game will be when Chicago Westinghouse enters the Cougar den and challenges the Side.  Two state champions in one gym, beautiful. Looks like a long season for the Side with that type of talent on the schedule.  We wish you the best Gary West.<p>
<p>3-05-02<p><p>Congratulations to the Valparaiso Vikings,Gary Roosevelt Panthers and the Gary West Side Cougars for getting the job done and shutting the mouths of so many critics who said that they were too undisciplined for a sectional championship.  We at the hoop side choose to wait have faith and a belief in the region and city schools of Gary although they are not blessed with the support system of the major programs throughout the state. Great job guys.<p><p>It is truly a shame to have two guys on television in the region who have no clue as to what the game of basketball is commentating on the region.  The region is full of quality teams and bias opinions should be kept out of a major forum.  Channel 56 has a show entitled the region roundball review and this show for the life of us at the hoop side continues to totally disrespect Gary schools.  We know that the sponsorships are predicated on those two guys kissy facing up to the big boys but it has gotten downright disgusting with their analysis.  Whenever you can place a Bishop Noll at the head of a poll when they have not beaten a team of Valparaiso's stature or a Gary Roosevelt, and even a Gary West Side then where is the credibility.  We would just like to say that just like they said Gary West Side never had a chance against a young Munster team and ate those words, we wish Mark Smith and Joe Arrendondo the best and hey guys come and watch some games before you continue to lose your credibility as fast as your ratings.<p><p>The Cougars got through a tournament that was extremely tough and physical.  Munster High School the clear favorite for next years Sectional 1 is extremely physical and this compensates for their lack of athleticism.  Lake Central is another team that is very physical.  You can learn quite a bit from those two programs. The Championship featured a never say die press you till you drop Lew Wallace team that forced Gary West Side into 20-25 turnovers.  The Cougars survived and will move on to face the best three point shooting team in the region,  Valparaiso.  Win or Lose the Cougars and Vikings represent the region and we all need to support or region champion, let's try and keep that in mind.<p><p>See you in the Gym<p>  <p>3-12-02<p.<p>Whew! We have been on a little vacation and really enjoyed ourselves watching Indiana High School Basketball.  The Regionals were absolutely an awesome experience.  The hoop side was very impressed with the Valparaiso Vikings and the South Bend Washington Panthers.  These two teams are class acts and fight until the finish.  The hoop side knows that both will be back even stronger.  Great game guys.<p><p>The Cougars from Gary West Side are a fun group to watch and play a controlled exciting brand of basketball.  They continue to stay focused on their goal of securing a place in Indiana basketball history.  Good Luck Cougars!!<p><p>The Hoop Side would like to say that the snub of Butler University from the NCAA was an injustice and something needs to be done to better the selection process.  Good luck to all the seniors and may you guys dreams come true.<p><p>The Hoop Side would also like to say that E.C. Central Athletic Director Bobby Miles cold comments toward the Gary Public School system Athletics was a bout with misinformation.  Bobby Miles is in no way able to comment on the status of the Gary Schools programs.  It is the negativity that arises from people in powerful position like his that hinder relationships that can be fruitful.  Coach Miles needs to take a step back and understand that his darts do more damage than good.  The Hoop Side personally thinks that the Gary Schools are on the move and will continue to upgrade their programs, and don't ever forget who is the most powerful city in the region.  Sometimes Gary just forgets who the most important people in the city are, its children.  The Hoop Side feels that a new beginning is on the rise, so Coach Bobby Miles encourage and help instead of doing as so many others, throw darts.  Go Gary!!!  The city can be a sports mecca again and soon.<p>
