    which led to more than 120 England fans being arrested before, during and after Wednesdays
    European qualifier. Captain Rene Lindenlaub said of the incidents:<p>&quot;We are a small,
    peace-loving country and not used to drunken aggression. We were tough but we make no
    apologies for reacting that way.&quot;</p>
    <p>The entire Luxembourg police force were on alert, as were military units and riot
    police as 5000 English fans were expected to descend on the principality. </p>
    <p>25 supporters were arrested at an airport in Belgium Tuesday night and deported for
    'drunkenness' offences. They spent the night in the transit area at Brussels Airport. A
    police spokesman said:</p>
    <p>&quot;They were arrested because they were drunk a menace to the public order.&quot;</p>
    <p>We await news from supporters about the treatment of fans.</font></td>
