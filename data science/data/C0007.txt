                              <font face="Arial" size="2">A number of brokers have brought to our attention letters sent to their clients by Premium Credit Limited, requesting confirmation within a period of two weeks that the clients will honour their agreement to pay outstanding instalments.<br>
                              <br>
                              Members will recall that BIBA took Counsel's Opinion shortly after the appointment of the Provisional Liquidators, and advised members of its understanding of the position with regard to both private individuals (with specific reference to the Consumer Credit Act) and to bodies corporate. We understand that Premium Credit Limited has confirmed that it will not pursue private policyholders for payment of outstanding instalments.<br>
                              <br>
                              We have maintained our view that the position of borrowers which are corporate bodies is likely to be rather different. The advice we have received suggests that such borrowers are unlikely to benefit from the protection of the Act, and that their liability to pay may well be determined by the particular terms of the contract under which the instalment arrangements were made. This advice remains unaltered.<br>
                              <br>
                              BIBA has now seen further Counsel's Opinion advising on this subject. In the view of Counsel, borrowers are obliged to comply with the terms of credit agreements notwithstanding the status of the insurance company to whom premiums were to have been made. Although it is clear that there was a connection between Premium Credit and Independent, in his view the obligations undertaken by the borrowers were independent of any insurance agreement and the borrower is not relieved of the obligation to comply with the terms of the credit agreement.<br>
                              <br>
                              It has been suggested that the doctrine of frustration may apply, and that the finance contracts had been frustrated by Independent's collapse. Counsel states that the subject matter of the credit agreements he has seen is not specifically referable to the health or otherwise of Independent. Case law (J.Lauritzen AS.Wijsmuller B.V. the Super Servant Two) (1990) 1 Lloyds Report 1 per Bingham L.J.) suggests that frustration cannot be invoked here.<br>
                              <br>
                              There is also some suggestion that the existence of some arrangement under which instalments were collected on behalf of Independent might cast doubt on the finance company's ability to enforce the agreement. Counsel's does not believe it can be said that the monies were to be collected on Independent's behalf. He suggests that the agreements between the parties remained essentially separate.<br>
                              <br>
                              We must point out that these comments are provided to support BIBA members in their discussions with clients. Our view remains that, irrespective of the strength of the arguments, or of legal advice, it is not possible to determine in advance the eventual outcome of any action for recovery of sums allegedly due for payment.<br>
                              <br>
                              Brokers should remind their clients of the potential consequences should they decide not to continue to make instalment payments. BIBA also recommends that clients should be advised to take their own legal advice, particularly with regard to interpretation of any premium finance agreements which may be in force.<br>

                              premiums gross. The suggestion is that brokers and

                              right to collect gross they will need to run a
                              test case to establish the legal position and win

                              It is important to bear in mind that the insurance
                              of legal defence costs (although many liability
                              policies include this cover) is not considered to
                              be a compulsory element of insurance. For example,
                              under an EL policy it is not compulsory to insure
                              legal defence costs.&nbsp; The corollary of this
                              is that whether the class of policy is in respect
                              of a liability for which insurance is compulsory
                              or otherwise, policyholders who are corporate
                              bodies are not automatically entitled to any
                              protection under the 1975 Act in respect of such
                              costs. Where the policy is in the name of an
                              individual and it covers such costs then, in
                              principle, PPA allows for protection at 90%.<br>
                              The Board is conscious that this is a difficult
                              area because it is in the Board’s (and the
                              Provisional Liquidators’) interests to ensure
                              that claims are properly defended in order to
                              achieve fair and economic settlements. The Board
                              is working with its legal advisers to define its
                              stance on the payment of legal defence costs in
                              respect of Independent policyholders and the
                              outcome of&nbsp; this will be advised as soon as

                                    It appears that instalment arrangements for
                                    premium payments were made available by
                                    Independent, either directly to its
                                    policyholders or via third party premium
                                    finance providers. Where Independent offered
                                    such arrangements directly, the Provisional
                                    Liquidators have said that they ‘will not
                                    seek to collect’ instalments due after the
                                    date of their appointment. This applies to
                                    annual policies and to longer-term (i.e.
                                    three-or-five-year) policies.<br>

                                    Where policyholders have entered into a
                                    premium finance arrangement with, for
                                    example, a bank or finance house, it is
                                    likely that this will be subject to a
                                    separate, stand-alone credit agreement.
                                    Under such agreements the policyholder will
                                    remain liable to continue to make the
                                    instalment payments under its terms until
                                    the loan is repaid in full. In these
                                    circumstances, the position of the
                                    policyholder will be the same as that of any
                                    other insured who has paid the full premium
                                    to the Independent. Any refund of premium
                                    allowed in the event of a scheme of
                                    arrangement is likely to amount to a
                                    proportion only of the pro-rata return
                                    premium, and may not be paid for at least a

                                    possible that Independent itself made
                                    arrangements with a premium finance company
                                    under which instalments were collected from
                                    policyholders on its behalf. Where this is
                                    the case, there is some doubt as to whether
                                    the premium finance company has the right to
                                    enforce the provisions of the finance

                                    the policyholder and the identity of the

                                    for any renewals or business which has

                                    is still some confusion over long-term

                                    anniversary date. Some sectors of the market

                                    is possible that some clients may insist on
                                    mid-term cancellation replacement and
                                    brokers will obviously have to act on their
                                    clients' instructions. BIBA reminds members
                                    to explain to their clients that this course
