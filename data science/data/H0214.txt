Darwin does not seem to have considered the origin of birds. He
mentions (5. edition) that wings and ability to fly may have
arisen from flappers of swimming pinguin-like animals. But he
seems to think of this as an example of intermediate stages
rather than a theory on how wings in birds actually evolved.</font></p>

traces of cycadoids, or any other trees, are noticed at the
Jurassic lagoon of Solnhofen where <em>Archaeopteryx</em> was
found. This fossil represents, however, a late representative of
the pre-avian evolution which was initiated millions of years
earlier and may have happened anywhere else.</font></p>

        The fontsides of two flat, square boxes of aluminium (100

        &quot;proto-feathers&quot; (pr f) of paper. Each boxes
        are filled with water, 100 ml. 20<sup>o</sup> C of

        heat-lamp and the temperature of the water is read at
        intervals of one minute. One degree of rise of

        twice the amount of heat as the &quot;feathered&quot;

        Then the two boxes are filled with the same amount of

        a dark room, and the drop of temperature is read. As to
        be seen from the graphs, the &quot;proto-feathers&quot;

Standing on a weighing machine it can be seen how the weight

Heilman</font></a><font face="Times New Roman">n deals with
another with another</font> description of the <font

which he was a co-author, &quot;</font><font size="2"
face="Arial">Danmarks Fugleliv af Gerhard Heilmann og A.L.V.
Manniche</font><font face="Times New Roman">&quot; (1928), he
writes:<br>
&quot; - - A bird flies as its wings are pressed against the
underlying air and moves it, for the air resists the pressure, a
counterpressure on the wing plate, which forces the bird forward.
The larger the wing plate is the more parts of air does it meet,
and the more vigorous the wingstroke is the greater velocity does
it give to the parts of air, and both these forces enlarges again
the speed of flight. But the effect increases when still new
parts of air come under the wing, either by a contrary air stream
or by the speed the bird has itself. - - &quot;</font> (My
translation).</p>

<p>Another description on how birds fly is to be found in a small
book, &quot;<font size="2" face="Arial">How to Draw Birds</font>&quot;
(1940) by Raymond Sheppard: &quot;- - the wing-feathers are
placed in such a way as to form what is known as the camber of a
bird's wing. You will realise this when looking along a bird's
open wing, - - it will be seen to curve upwards, umbrella
fashion. If you push an open umbrella up and down quickly you
will find it much easier to push it up than down because the
camber of the umbrella seems to grip the air on the downward
pull. This is roughly the principle that enables a bird to
fly.&quot;</p>

        &quot;scientific&quot;, but they are more relevant to
        birds' flight than text-book references to Bernoulli's
        theorem and other scientific, aero-dynamic principles.
        The umbrella- model makes it obvious that the effect of
        elevation depends on the the size and shape of the
        airfoils and the difference between the velocity of the
        downstroke and the upstroke. The greater the velocity of
        the downstroke is in relation to the upstroke, the
        greater is the elevating effect.<table border="0">

face="Times New Roman">the theory that dinosaurs are still with
us today in the form of birds.<br>
<b>My answer:</b></font><b> </b><font face="Times New Roman">The
idea that the dinosaurs still live with us as birds is a part of
the paradigm shift I mentioned in my answer to </font><a

color="#FF0000">Mikaela Rabinowitz</font></a><font
color="#FF0000">. <br>
</font><font face="Times New Roman">In the old days birds and
dinosaurs were considered to belong to two different classes of
vertebrates, dinosaurs to the class of cold-blooded, naked or
scaled reptiles, whereas birds belong to a class of its own, a
class of warm-blooded, feathered, and generally flying
vertebrates. But the great resemblance of birds and the fossil </font><a
href="http://odur.let.rug.nl/~nieuwlnd/Archae.html"><font
color="#FF0000"><i>Archaeopteryx</i></font></a> <font
face="Times New Roman">to the bipedal theropod dinosaurs,
indicated that birds and dinosaurs are closely related.<br>
By his book, &quot;The Origin of Birds&quot; (1926), the Danish
artist, </font><a
href="http://odur.let.rug.nl/~nieuwlnd/heilmann.html"><font
color="#FF0000">Gerhard Heilmann</font></a><font
face="Times New Roman"> proposed that birds originated from a
hypothetical</font><a
href="http://home13.inet.tele.dk./palm/orifig/fig6.gif"> <font
color="#FF0000"><i>proavis</i></font> </a><font
face="Times New Roman">a two-legged dinosaur-ancestor, a reptile
which lived on the ground, and eventually climbed trees. Heilmann
rejected the dinosaurs as bird-ancestors because the particular
bird-bone of fused collar-bones, called &quot;furcula&quot; or
&quot;wish-bone&quot;, was not found in any dinosaur. According
to this the birds were separeted from the dinosaurs.</font></p>

<table border="0">
    <tr>
        <td valign="top"><font face="Times New Roman">This theory
        was generally accepted until 1974 when Prof. John H.
        Ostrom of Yale University emphasised the obvious
        similarity of the wrist structure of <i>Archaeopteryx</i>
        and birds in general<i> </i>to<i> Deinonychus</i> and
        other two-legged, bird-like animals from Cretaceous. He
        therefore revived the old theory and proposed that birds
        arose from ground-running dinosaurs like <i>Deinonychus.</i>
        <br>
        Together with the idea that dinosaurs were warm-blooded,
        active animals, it was an obvious consequence to consider
        birds not even to be dinosaur-relatives, but to be a part
        of a dinosaur-class. </font>(<font face="Times New Roman">As
        for the history of this theory, see &quot;The Hot-blooded
        Dinosaurs&quot;, (1975) by Adrian J. Desmond.). Besides
        traces of furcula was found in some dinosaurs. <br>
        What separated birds from dinosaurs was therefore that
        birds have feathers, wings and can fly.</font></td>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In 1997 was in China discovered a
number of fossils of small, two-legged animals which were
proclaimed to be dinosaurs. <i>And some of these were feathered.</i>
</font><a
href="http://www.peabody.yale.edu/exhibits/cfd/CFDintro.html"><font
color="#FF0000">&quot;The feathered dinosaurs from China&quot;</font></a><font
face="Times New Roman"> were generally taken not even as a
confirmation of the birds&#146; descend from dinosaurs, but it
was also concluded that dinosaurs were feathered and
warm-blooded. Not only the bird-like ones, but dinosaurs as such,
even the enormous Tyrannosaur were considered to be feathered.
Also the gigantic sauropods and the ornitischian dinosaurs, the
rhinoceros-like ceratopians have been claimed to be feathered.
Then most of the boundary between birds and dinosaurs vanished.
Left was only that birds generally have wings and can fly, but as
ostriches and penguins cannot fly and as the kiwi of New Zealand
have no wings, this is not considered as a relevant distinction. <br>
As a systematic consequence the dinosaurs and the birds should be
considered as one and the same: Birds are dinosaurs!
Consequently, the dinosaurs still exist!</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">A weakness of the theory is,
however, that the feathered fossils from China as well as</font> <font
face="Times New Roman"><i>Deinonychus</i> and other two-legged,
most bird-like dinosaurs, are from Cretaceous, which is about 25
mill. years <i>later</i> than <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, which is from
Jurassic. And as it immediately can be seen from the fossil<i>
Archaeopteryx</i> was not even feathered, it had wings which as
for size and shape are much like wings of modern flying birds.
And as flying is what wings are for, it no doubt could fly.<br>
In other words, <i>Archaeopteryx</i> was a bird, why birds
existed millions of years before the Chinese fossils lived.
Whatever these are, they certainly are not bird-ancestors! More
likely they are prehistoric birds, descendants of <i>Archaeopteryx</i>
and other feathered pre-birds, which have given up flying like
the ostriches, the dodos, the kiwis and the penguins of modern
time, and the tall flightless diatryma of Early Eocene and the
huge carnivore phorusrhachids of Lower Miocene. No wonder
therefore if they had feathers as they were birds! <br>
Another weakness of the theory is that no undoubted evidence of
feathers has been discovered in any dinosaur. Some fringes to be
see in connection to some dinosaur fossils have by enthusiastic
adherents of the theory been interpreted as feathers or downs,
but it must be emphasised that this is far from undisputed. <br>
A critical account of the debate with references to relevant
articles is to be found in chapter 9 of Prof. Alan
Feduccia&#146;s splendid book &quot;The Origin and Evolution of
Birds.&quot; (1999 - the paperback edition). I also call your
