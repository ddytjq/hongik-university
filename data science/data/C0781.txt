<P><i>What chance has England got at the forthcoming Euro 2000? Paul Wince reports.</i>
<p><b>Euro '96 seems a long time ago and yet the wound in the English subconscious caused by Gareth Southgate's crucial missed penalty runs deep. Not helped, of course, by David Batty's equally fine balls-up in the World Cup two years ago.</b></p> 

<p>England supporters still tend to bask in the <b>glory of '66</b> - in the vain glorious hope that we will one day 'raise our game' when playing teams infinitely better than ourselves. It's a little bit like <b>Cardiff City</b> supporters harking back to the FA cup victory of <b>1927</b> - despite languishing ever since in the <b>lower divisions</b> of British football.</p> 

<p>I guess it's that same <b>"we did it once, we can do it again"</b> attitude that's responsible for a growing optimism creeping into my veins whenever there's a mention of <b>Euro 2000</b>. Despite scraping through by the skin of our teeth, English football fans everywhere believe we've a strong chance of <b>winning</b>.</p> 

<p>We're comforted by the fact that England coach <b>Kevin Keegan</b> does actually make the team practice penalty shoot-outs - something which we'll forever hold against Hoddle (as well as his ludicrous reincarnation beliefs). And when HRH Fergie can inspire Man Utd to such unbeatable performances, surely English football can triumph in <b>Amsterdam</b>?</p>

<p>The competition which kicks off on <b>June 10</b> (and runs until July 2) takes place in <b>Belgium and Holland</b>. England first goes into <b>Group A</b> action on June 12 against Portugal, followed by Germany on June 17 and Romania on June 20. The quarter final we may find ourselves in takes place on June 24 - if we come top of Group A, we'll probably meet <b>Sweden</b>, if we come second, we'll probably meet <b>Italy</b>. </p>

<p>I daren't forecast any further ahead, in case I put the mockers on any <b>English victory</b>. However I can confidently predict that the semi finals will take place on June 28 and 29, with the grand final on <b>July 2</b> in <b>Rotterdam!</b> </p>

<p>If you're <b>lucky</b> enough to have tickets already, getting there is a doddle. I heartily recommend <b>Eurostar</b>, though if you've wheels of your own and duty-free lager is a priority, then there are numerous ferry routes to check out: <a href="http://www.seaview.co.uk" target="_top">www.seaview.co.uk</a> gives you details on all the companies, routes and their offers. As for accommodation, for Dutch hotels try <a href="http://www.bookings.nl" target="_top">www.bookings.nl</a> and for Belgium have a look at <a href="http://www.atlas-hotel.be/atlas" target="_top">www.atlas-hotel.be/atlas</a>. </p>

<p>And if you're taking <b>other halves</b> who aren't that into the great game (difficult to believe myself), then there's plenty of other stuff to keep them <b>entertained</b> while you're shouting yourself horse at Charleroi. For Amsterdam try: <a href="http://www.amsterdamfordummies.nl" target="_top">www.amsterdamfordummies.nl</a>, <a href="http://www.amsterdam-ts.nl" target="_top">www.amsterdam-ts.nl</a> and <a href="http://www.amsterdamhotspots.nl" target="_top">www.amsterdamhotspots.nl</a>. For Belgium, take a virtual tour of the Belgian capital at <a href="http://www.brussels.cromozone.be" target="_top">www.brussels.cromozone.be</a> and for the latest entertainment check out, <a href="http://www.ib.be/meet/entertai.html" target="_top">www.ib.be/meet/entertai.html</a>.</p>

<p>If you don't have tickets, it's probably <b>too late</b>. But you could always give a ticket broker a try (and be prepared <b>spend ££ss!!</b>) such as <a href="http://www.thetticket.co.uk" target="_top">www.thetticket.co.uk</a>. <b>Good luck!</b></p>
