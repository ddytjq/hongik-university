<P><i>Baby merchandise is big business on the net, but what do you really need and where can you find it on the web? Recent first time mum, Eartha Moma, gives you the low-down</i></font>

<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2">

<p><b>There's two things you need to know about buying things for babies. Firstly there are things that you need to buy, and secondly there are things that you don't need to buy, but buy anyway. </b></p>

<p>Baby clothes are a very good example of this conundrum. The problem is baby clothes look <b>cute</b>. Whether you're a new parent-in-waiting or buying for a friend, the '<b>buy me</b>' factor sometimes surpasses the reasonable 'far too expensive' and 'how often will baby really wear this' factor. Take it from me, some of the stuff may look great, but try getting it on a <b>wriggling, wobbly-headed newborn</b> and you'll soon change your mind. </p>

<p>Always look at the <b>fastenings</b> - or lack of fastenings - and the <b>fabrics</b>. A cashmere jumper in miniature may look darling but in reality is totally impractical. For the freshly hatched, the best thing to give or receive is the classic all-in-one sleep suit. They may be a little traditional, but they are a godsend. Remember first time mums have spent most of their pre-baby shopping time in Baby Gap, buying the stuff baby will never wear. What they find they'll need are boring, <b>towelling sleep suits</b> - hundreds of them. The same goes for <b>all-in-one vests</b>. </p>

<p>Another thing you need to avoid buying for this age range are separates eg pyjama tops and bottoms. Newborns need to be <b>warm</b> and separates in nightwear just don't work. Separates only become useful when a baby is around 4-6 months old - and it's summertime. </p>

<p>And on that time of year note, be wary of buying stuff in <b>sales</b>. Remember if a baby is born in June, he won't need 0-3 month size fleeces. Similarly winter babes won't need shorts. </p>

<p>When it comes to fabrics, don't be put off by '<b>inflammable material</b>' warnings. You won't find an item of baby clothing on the planet that doesn't seem to infer that it's a firebomb waiting to go off.</p>

<p>Beware of what size you buy too. Unless you/your friend has a premature baby, I wouldn't advise forking out for anything marked 'newborn' - apart from nappies that is. Anything 'newborn' is destined to last a very short time, and why buy it when you can get the exact same thing in say 0-3 months? </p>

<p>A baby's head is big, so watch out for <b>hats</b>. Some 6-12month old sizes, are just big enough for the average 4 month old.</p>

<p>Something you might think you don't need, but will are <b>baby shoes</b>. OK he's not going anywhere, but you'll save many a sock with some nice little bootees. </p>

<p>When it comes to the equipment you need there are the obvious and not so obvious things to consider. For example you will need a pushchair/pram, cot and car seat. You can get a pushchair that doubles up as a car seat and despite their expense, they are worth considering for another, other than practical reason. They are the only pushchairs where baby is facing you. Most traditional pushchairs have you pushing baby from behind, making conversation - no matter how entertaining - difficult. </p>

<p>And unless you live in a house with a large bathroom, I wouldn't advise buying a <b>baby bath</b>. Again, they look good and you can get gift sets of them, but what you/the new parent really needs is a baby bath support. They are only around £10 and little more than a towelling frame that you place in a regular bath. It's useable from birth and saves loads of space. </p>

<p>Another thing which will prove invaluable is a <b>baby sleeping bag</b> - suitable from 3 months. Despite the parlous state of British football, you'll be amazed at the kicking strength of the average bambino. Blankets? Forget 'em. </p>

<p>Baby sleeping bags cost around £20-£30. Which brings me onto another point: <b>shop around</b> - particularly on the internet. Some baby sites seem a little more expensive than the high street so make sure you visit sites like <A HREF="http://www.mothercare.com" TARGET="_blank">www.mothercare.com</A> as well as some of the more quirkier named ones. </p>
