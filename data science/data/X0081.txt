      <p><img src="images/images_timberline/ph4_vista.jpg" width="220" height="278" align="right" alt="Kent and Thomas Brunson" border="3">Mule 
        Deer Hunting! When Dennis Latsha, co-owner of HuntGuide.Com, told me about 
        an invitation he received to hunt mule deer in Nevada with Timberline 
        Outfitters Guide Service, I didn't hesitate in making my decision. I was 
        going!! Of course, before I could pack my equipment, I had to be lucky 
        enough to draw a tag. </p>
      <p>It was February 2001, and while the weather was bitter cold in Pennsylvania, 
        I was starting to make plans for the fall hunt. I contacted Kent Brunson, 
        co-owner of Timberline Outfitters Guide Service, and he assisted me with 
        filling out the necessary application. I would be applying for a 2001 
        Restricted Nonresident Guided Hunt tag for mule deer. Since Kent is a 
        licensed master guide in the state of Nevada, Timberline is able to offer 
        guided hunt tags to their clients. Applying for a guided nonresident license 
        would hopefully improve my odds of drawing a tag. I completed the necessary 
        paperwork and mailed the application before the deadline of March 09, 
        2001. A few weeks later, with luck on my side, I received a call from 
        Kent informing me I had drawn a tag for unit 121. </p>
      <p>Since my hunt would take place in October, I had plenty of time to make 
        my preparations. After making airline reservations, hotel reservations, 
        practicing at the rifle range and several conversations with Kent over 
        the summer, I was ready to hunt Nevada! </p>
      <p>I arrived at Salt Lake City international airport on October 20th, 2001. 
        I picked up my rental car and made the 4 hour drive to McGill, Nevada, 
        home base for Timberline Outfitters. The scenery along my drive was magnificent. 
        Large open expanses of salt flats near Salt Lake City lead into tumbleweed 
        prairies, rolling foothills and high mountain peaks in the Humboldt National 
        Forest. I was greeted by Kent and his wife, Pat, in their spacious living 
        room, which was filled with mule deer, elk and antelope trophies taken 
        by family members over the years. After enjoying a wonderful dinner prepared 
        by Pat, and discussing our &quot;plan of attack&quot; for the week, I 
        checked into my hotel in the nearby town of Ely. Let the hunt begin!</p>
      <p>My first day of hunting began at 4:30 AM when Eddie Spear, a sub-guide 
        for Timberline, picked me up at the hotel. We picked Kent up at his house 
        and headed to the northern tier of unit 121, where we would be hunting 
        on BLM land. Unfortunately, the area of the state where I was hunting 
        had been experiencing a very dry year. The weather was also very warm, 
        with temperatures ranging in the 60s during the afternoon. Since the drive 
        to our hunting grounds required over 40 miles of paved rode and 20 miles 
        of dirt road, the unseasonably warm, dry weather had taken a toll on the 
        backcountry roads. I was glad we were in a 4X4 pickup. Near the base of 
        the hunting range, we met up with Kent's son, Thomas Brunson, who is also 
        a licensed master guide and co-owner of Timberline Outfitters Guide Service. 
        Thomas had been camped at the base of the mountain range with another 
        client, Ryan Krampl of Alberta, Canada. The five of us would drive, via 
        4-wheel drive, to the top of a nearby mountain in the Butte Valley, where 
        we would be spending the entire day.</p>
      <p><img src="images/images_timberline/ph_muledeer.jpg" width="224" height="246" align="right" border="3">As 
        we reached the top of the mountain, the sun was just beginning to rise. 
        Our initial glassing efforts spotted five doe and two small buck on top 
        of a ridgeline. Since we were looking for a mature buck, we decided to 
        start hiking along the ridgeline. We hadn't walked very far when Kent 
        and Thomas spotted a group of four deer feeding on a hill directly below 
        us at about 800 yards. Thomas set up his spotting scope and determined 
        that it was a bachelor group of bucks. At least three of the bucks had 
        decent size racks. One of the three bucks was a 4X4 with about a 25 inch 
        spread. Both Ryan and I decided the bucks were worth a closer look.</p>
      <p>We moved down the mountain to a ridgeline, which positioned us about 
        400 yards above where we had last seen the bucks feeding. Unfortunately, 
        the bucks had moved into the timber and we could no longer see them. Kent, 
        Thomas and Eddie decided that the best course of action was to try and 
        drive the deer back into the open so we could get a better look and possibly 
        a shot. Ryan, Thomas and I took up a position on a high point overlooking 
        a large draw, while Kent and Eddie attempted to push the deer out of the 
        timber. As we all know, deer can be unpredictable, and as such, was the 
        case with this group. The bucks foiled our plan and broke out of the timber 
        in a different direction. </p>
      <p>While we waited for Kent and Eddie to return from their walk, I had a 
        chance to speak with Ryan about his experience with Timberline. Ryan had 
        met Thomas Brunson while the two were attending taxidermy school in Montana. 
        In addition to providing guide services, Thomas is also a licensed taxidermist 
        in the state of Nevada. Ryan had been hunting for three days prior to 
        my arrival, and he had seen an average of about nine bucks per day. He 
        indicated that several of the bucks sported a 21 to 23 inch spread. Ryan 
        was holding out for a trophy size mule deer. </p>

      </table>
      <p>After Kent and Eddie returned, we decided to eat an early lunch and spend 
        the rest of the day hiking around the mountains. To say we had a light 
        lunch was an understatement. The lunch, which was provided throughout 
        my entire stay, was fantastic. Pat does not want any client going hungry 
        while they are under the care of Timberline Outfitters. She had fresh 
        baked croissants, home roasted turkey and roast beef, frog eye salad, 
        pretzels, pumpkin cake, Oreo cookie granola bars, and apple crumb muffins&#133;.just 
        to mention a few of the items.</p>
      <p>After lunch, Thomas and Ryan decided to hunt the western side of the 
        mountain while Kent, Eddie and I hunted the eastern side of the mountain. 
        The warm temperatures were working against us all week. The deer would 
        spend the first two hours of daylight feeding, then bed down for the rest 
        of the day. Typically, the deer didn't move much again until the last 
        hour of daylight. By the end of the day, we saw two more buck, a small 
        3X3 and a nice 4X4 with a 23-24 inch spread. Unfortunately, the buck was 
        too far away to attempt a stalk before daylight faded. Thomas and Ryan 
        had also glassed another buck, but they decided to pass as well. </p>
      <p>The second day of my hunt, we decided to try the same general area, but 
        employ a different technique. Thomas and Ryan would drive to the top of 
        the same mountain we hunted the previous day, while Kent and I would park 
        at the bottom and walk our way up through several draws and saddles. As 
        Kent and I left the truck at daybreak and headed up the mountain, we could 
        hear the distant howls of coyotes as they returned to their dens from 
        a night of hunting. We glassed several good canyons as we followed the 
        wide trails made by the wild mustangs, which inhabit the area. As we made 
        our way back to the truck for lunch, we had only counted three deer that 
        morning. We hoped that Thomas and Ryan had a better day.</p>
      <p>A better day they had indeed! The good news was waiting on Kent's voice 
        mail&#133;.Ryan had killed a nice buck. Thomas and Ryan had spotted the 
        wide racked buck feeding early in the morning. They watched the buck bed 
        down on the side of hill and stalked to within shooting distance. At 9:30am, 
        Ryan made an excellent shot at 351 yards to kill the buck where he had 
        bedded. The buck was an old 2X2 that had a 29-inch spread. The tine lengths 
        on the buck were unbelievable. It took Thomas and Ryan until 3:30 that 
        afternoon to cape, quarter and pack the deer back to the truck. </p>
      <p>Kent and I finished out the day in some mountains near McGill. We saw 
        twelve doe and two buck, a 2X2 and a 3X3. Even though I had an opportunity 
        for a kill, I opted to pass on the bucks in hopes of finding a bigger 
        one. </p>
      <p>On day three of my hunt, Ray Sawyer, another sub-guide for Timberline 
        Outfitters, joined Kent and me. We decided to hunt a different area in 
        Unit 121, one that Ray was quite familiar with. Ray had glassed several 
        good bucks and one outstanding buck, while he had been hunting the area 
        earlier this year during the muzzleloader season. While the temperatures 
        dropped slightly, which was a good thing for us, the winds picked up considerably. 
        Needless to say, when you hunt at an elevation of nearly 9800 feet above 
        sea level, the air seems much colder. It felt like the temperatures were 
        in the teens with the wind chill. We covered a lot of ground this day, 
        but no buck could be found. By the end of the day, we had glassed over 
        twenty doe. </p>
      <p>Day four started out early with an exciting, but tiring stalk on a nice 
        3X4 buck. I was guided today by both Kent and Thomas. Thomas had glassed 
        this buck earlier in the week while hunting with Ryan, so we decided to 
        see if he was still feeding in the same area. Sure enough, when we parked 
        the truck in the canyon, we were able to see several deer feeding on top 
        of a nearby mountain. Thomas pulled out his spotting scope and identified 
        the 23-inch wide buck as the one he had spotted before. I studied the 
        buck through the scope and decided that he was worth a shot.</p>
      <p><img src="images/images_timberline/mountainview.jpg" width="257" height="150" border="3" alt="Mountain view" align="right">I 
        must admit, it looked much easier standing at the base of the mountain 
        than actually trying to climb up to where the buck was feeding. Since 
        I'm always up for a challenge, I gave it my best effort. Thomas remained 
        near the base of the mountain to keep an eye on the buck while Kent and 
        I made the difficult stalk. We knew the buck wouldn't stay out in the 
        open long, so we kicked it into overdrive hiking up the mountain. At 500 
        yards from where we had last seen the buck feeding, we stopped to re-establish 
        his position. Knowing the shot was still too long, we continued up the 
        mountain. When we finally had ourselves positioned within 230 yards of 
        where the buck had been, we could not locate him. He had moved into the 
        timber.</p>
      <p>Since we had worked so hard to make it to this point, we were not about 
        to give up. Kent decided we should try to work our way above where the 
        buck had been, and try to sneak into his bedding area. So up the mountain 
        we climbed&#133;.almost to the peak. We slowly crept down the mountain, 
        directly above where we thought the buck might have bedded. We spent almost 
        an hour sneaking down the side of the mountain, but we couldn't find the 
        buck. We finally arrived back at our starting point around noon. Thomas 
        had watched the buck during our stalk, and he said the buck disappeared 
        into the timber about 5 minutes before we made it into effective shooting 
        range. After that, he never saw the buck again.</p>
      <p>We finished the day by glassing and walking several nearby canyons. By 
        the time the sun went down, we saw another fifteen doe and one young 3X4 
        buck. Needless to say, I was completely exhausted by the time this day 
        was over. </p>
      <p>On the fifth day of my hunt, it was just Thomas and myself. With an Elk 
        hunt approaching on Saturday, Kent needed to prepare the camping equipment 
        for the hunt. Thomas decided we should return to the area where Ryan had 
        shot his buck earlier in the week. We were on top of the mountain as the 
        sun was starting to lighten the morning sky. The wind was so cold, I thought 
        my ears would freeze and fall off. Boy, do I love hunting! We spent the 
        morning glassing several good saddles and draws on both sides of the mountain. 
        We saw several does and a young 2X3 buck with about a 15-inch spread. 
        Based on the way the rack looked, it appeared this young buck was the 
        offspring of the buck Ryan had harvested. Again, I opted to pass on this 
        buck.</p>
      <p>After having lunch, we decided to head back to the southern end of unit 
        121, near McGill. We stopped at home base to pick up Nicholas Brunson, 
        also a sub-guide for Timberline Outfitters. Thomas's younger brother, 
        Nicholas was home from college for the weekend. Nicholas suggested we 
        try a local canyon where two good bucks had been seen the week prior. 
        One of the bucks was a stag, having three main beams still covered in 
        velvet and the second buck a nice 4X4. </p>
      <p>We drove into the canyon and glassed several hills. We found a stag, 
        but not the one Nicholas had heard about. As we were walking back to the 
        truck, we kicked out several deer from some thick timber. One of the deer 
        was a small stag with a spike on one side and three points on the other, 
        both still covered in velvet. We saw several more doe, but no buck.</p>
      <p>On the sixth and last day of my hunt, Nicholas Brunson would guide me. 
        We spent the morning driving to several different areas, making small 
        hikes and glassing multiple canyons. We decided to return to the area 
        we hunted the previous evening, in search of the large stag. Around 9:00 
        am, as we were walking along the top of a small ridgeline, I glassed a 
        nice size buck directly across the canyon from us. I didn't hesitate pulling 
        the gun off my shoulder. Nicholas thought the buck was about 250 yards 
        away, so I held the cross hairs right on the shoulder. After regaining 
        my composure from the kick of the 300 Winchester Magnum, I asked Nicholas 
        if I had hit the buck. He said the buck bolted down the backside of the 
        far mountain, so he wasn't sure if my shot had connected. We gathered 
        our gear, and made the hike across the canyon to search for sign of a 
        hit.</p>
      <p>Upon reaching the spot where the buck had been standing, both Nicholas 
        and I knew the shot had been accurate. We found the telltale sign of a 
        lung shot deer. We followed the blood trail for about 40 yards and found 
        the buck under a large mahogany tree. Both Nicholas and I were ecstatic. 
        After a physically demanding week of hunting the high mountains of Nevada, 
        I was extremely proud of the nice 4X4 buck I had just harvested. </p>
      <p>If you're looking for an exciting hunt in Nevada for trophy mule deer, 
        you'll definitely want to give Timberline Outfitters Guide Service a call. 
        In their second year of business, Timberline Outfitters Guide Service 
        provides hunts for mule deer, elk, antelope and mountain lion. Since over 
        80% of Nevada hunting grounds are public, they provide high quality hunts 
        on BLM and forest service lands. As licensed master guides, Kent and Thomas 
        provide guide services in areas 10, 11, 12, 13, 22 &amp; 23. In addition, 
        Thomas offers a 10% discount on taxidermy services for clients who book 
        with Timberline Outfitters Guide Service.</p>
      <p>I had the opportunity to hunt with five different guides throughout my 
        week with Timberline Outfitters. I was very impressed with their knowledge 
        of the area, the friendly atmosphere and their desire to help the hunter 
        be successful. While I chose to make my hunt very physically demanding, 
        they will tailor the hunt to the capabilities of the hunter. During 2000, 
        their first year of business, they had a 50% success rate for both mule 
        deer and antelope. Elk hunting is definitely one of their passions. For 
        2000, they attained a 100% success rate with the average bull scoring 
        350 B&amp;C. Due to their overwhelming success in the 2000 elk season, 
        they have expanded their business in 2001 to include ten sub-guides for 
        elk hunting. So far this year, the antelope season yielded a 100% success 
        rate and of the seven mule deer hunters, who have completed their hunts 
        this year, five have taken home a buck.</p>
      <p>Remember that applications for fall 2002 big game hunts in Nevada typically 
        need to be completed early in the year. If a picture is worth a thousand 
        words, check out <a href="timberline.htm"><font size="2">Timberline Outfitters 
        Guide Service web site</font></a> for some impressive animals their clients 
        have harvested. For an unforgettable adventure, give Thomas or Kent a 
        call and they'll be glad to talk to you about a hunt.</p>
