<A HREF="index.html">mirrored</A>
in 3 places.
See the
<A HREF="mirror-request.html">mirror request</A> page if you are
interested in mirroring the IOCCC (especially from an area that we do
not have already covered).
<BR><BR>

<LI><FONT SIZE="4">8 Mar 2002</FONT>: The winners of the
16th International Obfuscated C Code Contest have been selected.
We are in the process of notifying the winners by EMail.
The list of
<A HREF="whowon.html">who won the 16th IOCCC</A> is available.
<BR><BR>
The source code for the winning entries is not yet available.
We will be giving the 16th IOCCC winners a chance to review our writeup
of their entries.
We hope to release the winning source by mid April 2002.
<BR><BR>

<LI><FONT SIZE="4">4 Mar 2002</FONT>: We are literally several days away
from posting the list of the winning entries. One of
the judges had connectivity problems last week - sorry for the delay.
<BR><BR>

<LI><FONT SIZE="4">27 Feb 2002</FONT>:
We have now reached the final judging rounds.
Here is a brief (incomplete) list of reasons for disqualification
this year:

<UL>
<LI>usage of a non-POSIX include file, e.g. conio.h</LI>

<LI>unannounced dependence on endianness</LI>

<LI>unannounced dependence on unaligned word access</LI>

<LI>entry is not obfuscated after preprocessing</LI>

<LI>entry is not original, we've seen the code elsewhere</LI>

<LI>entry fails to perform</LI>

<LI>an ANSI&nbsp;C compiler legitimately errors out</LI>
</UL>
<BR><BR>

<LI><FONT SIZE="4">5 Jan 2002</FONT>:
Finally, there is a version of
<A HREF="years.html#1988_isaak">1988/isaak</A> that compiles and works
in modern C environments.
<BR><BR>

<LI><FONT SIZE="4">25 Dec 2001</FONT>:
The location of the original source for Nathan Sidwell's
<A HREF="years.html#1992_nathan">1992 winner</A>
has been updated.

<LI><FONT SIZE="4">02 Dec 2001</FONT>:
The 16th International Obfuscated C Code Contest closed on
<B>01 Dec 2001 23:59:59 UTC</B>.
Right now the
<A HREF="judges.html">judges</A>

The best guess on when the winners will be announced
is Jan or Feb 2002.
<BR><BR>

<LI><FONT SIZE="4">27 Nov 2001</FONT>:
The hint file for Brian Westley's
<A HREF="years.html#1988_westley">1988 winner</A>

<LI><FONT SIZE="4">31 Oct 2001</FONT>:
Added an official IOCCC <A HREF="faq.html">FAQ</A>.
<BR><BR>

<LI><FONT SIZE="4">12 Oct 2001</FONT>:
Fixed a typo in the
<A HREF="guidelines.html">guidelines</A>
relating to use of OpenMotif and removed
the previous sentence that seemed to
contradict the newly permitted use of OpenMotif.
Sorry<SUP>2</SUP>!
<BR><BR>

<LI><FONT SIZE="4">02 Oct 2001</FONT>:
A
<A HREF="guidelines.html">guidelines</A>
change mark relating to the permitted
use of OpenMotif was missing from the
<FONT SIZE="4">01 Oct 2001</FONT> posting, sorry.
This oversight has been corrected.
