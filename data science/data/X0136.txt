March 8-9, 2002</CENTER></H2><P>

The Hannes Schneider Meister Cup Race is unlike any ski race in history. It combines the best of skiing today with the warm nostalgia of yesterday. It honors some of ski history's most enduring figures, many of whom are expected to take part in this memorable event. And it honors the founding father of ski instruction, Austrian Skimeister Hannes Schneider, who brought his world-renowned skills to North Conway and Mt. Cranmore in 1939. Schneider introduced skiing fun and excitement to millions around the globe.<P>

Your participation is all for a great cause: the New England Ski Museum. The New England Ski Museum in Franconia, NH, is an educational archive of skiing history with colorful exhibits, an extensive library, and numerous film preservation projects. Admission is free of charge to the public.<P>

When you enter the Hannes Schneider Meister Cup Race, you will be part of an historic weekend at Cranmore including participation in this unique ski race, social events, and slopeside pageantry. You will rub elbows with some of skiing's greatest champions from another era.<P>

If you can turn around a few gates on intermediate terrain, you are invited to participate in the race…and win! All entrants are eligible for our prize drawing, no matter how you do in the race. The names of the winning team and individuals will be inscribed on the handsome Hannes Schneider Meister Cup trophy on permanent display in the New England Ski Museum.<P>
