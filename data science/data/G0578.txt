<center><h2>Only the brave and the curious continue!  I shall put forth
such ideas as Schwarzschild's metric for spacetime and the Schwarzschild
radius equation --- not for the timid or mathematically
meek!</h2></center>
I'm kidding.  They're not really that bad, but I feel the need to warn you
that I'm going to actually show two equations, and I know seeing equations
frightened me when I was surfing for black hole pages.  No real math here;
I just think it's important to show 'em.

What the heck does this equation mean? It's for calculating the
Schwarzschild radius of an object. What does that have to do with black
holes? Well, when an object is compressed below its Schwarzschild Radius,
an event horizon forms around it. Sound familiar? The event horizon of a
black hole is just R<sub>s</sub> = r. If you know the mass of an object,
you can calculate its R<sub>s</sub>.  For a human it is 1.5 x
10<sup>-27</sup> meters per kilogram (for comparison a proton is
10<sup>-15</sup> meters). Very tiny! It's tough to make black holes out of
small things!

<h2>What is the Schwarzschild metric?</h2>
It is Schwarzschild's solution to Eintstein's general relativity equation
set.  The metric describes the shape of spacetime <i>outside</i> of
matter. Y'know, those cool curvey spacetime pictures in Scientific
American. Once you hit matter, be it some gas, a star, a planet, or a
rock, this metric no longer applies.  The metric's kinda ... spherical.
It looks a lot like an equation made for rectangular coordinates
transformed into spherical coordinates, a standard calculus problem.
<h2>What does all that messy stuff mean?</h2>
Well, the ds factor tells you how space changes, what it all looks like. 
 The dt factor tells how time changes as spacetime changes. You can
see that, if r = R<sub>s</sub>, dt would be zero. That is to say that at
the even horizon there would be no change in time. Makes sense; you can
look at the event horizon as being the place where time "stops." The dr
factor deals with how close to something you are. You'll notice that it
"blows up" when r = R<sub>s</sub>; the Schwarzschild metric does not apply
beyond the event horizon. The d<img src="../media/theta.gif" width="11"
height="15"> and d<img src="../media/phi.gif" width="11"
height="18"> factors are part of the whole spherical geometry
transformation thing and aren't special to the metric. They make the math
work out right, yes they do.
