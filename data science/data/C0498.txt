<p align="left">In the current economic climate mortgage payment protection
insurance (mppi) is a must - but do&nbsp;&nbsp; not be stampeded into buying the mortgage
payment protection insurance offered by your lender. An independent survey
showed that taking out our mortgage payment protection insurance policy could
save you over £2,000 over a 25 year term.</p>
<h3 align="left">Key considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">90 families a day had their homes repossessed in 2000 - the
    majority due to problems due to unemployment.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">One in 3 people aged between 25 and 34 have experienced
    unemployment for a period in excess of one month</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">There are nearly 1,000,000 people registered as unemployed</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Every day 500 people become unemployed: 60% of unemployed
    men and 45% of unemployed women will be out of work for 6 months or more.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Every adult in Britain is 5 times more likely to suffer a
    serious disability than die before the age of 60.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Today in Britain 2,900 people will start claiming State
    Benefits</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">1,800,000 people in Britain are already disabled for at
    least 12 months.</li>
</ul>
<h3 align="left">How the State (does not) help</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">State benefits for a single person are currently under £60
    per week .</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">The benefit for 2 adults and 2 children ranges from £96 to
    £134 per week</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">New borrowers get no help with their payments for 9 months.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">They then get 50% benefit for the next four months.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">If they qualify (70% do not) for income support then they
    get full benefit on loans up to £100,000.</li>
</ul>
<h3 align="left">How our policy will help</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">We can cover up to £1,500 per month or 65% of your salary</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Three months free disability and redundancy cover if you are
    taking out the policy at the start of your loan OR switch to us from your
    current provider</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">NO initial exclusion period on transfers - cover continues
    automatically</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">You can choose joint cover and a 30 day or 60 day excess
    period.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Our policy covers employed, self employed, proprietors,
    share holding Directors and their relatives (NB definition is 'ceased to
    trade' rather than 'made redundant' or dismissed.)</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">As with all other similar policies our payment protection policy
commences its excess period (30 or 60 days) from the date that employment ceases
<b>or</b> from the date that the period of notice would expire - this means that
if you were paid 3 months wages in lieu of notice your benefit would not start
until the end of the 4th or 5th month.</p>
