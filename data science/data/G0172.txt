<p>This paper asks why so few philosophers and scientists have paid much attention to the concept of infinity, and it expresses surprise at the readiness with which the idea of infinity has been accepted as meaningful even in fields where it causes serious logical difficulties. I try to show that belief in a universe containing an infinite number of material objects is logically flawed, and I examine the cosmological consequences.</p>

<p><center>***</center></p>

<h4>THE CONCEPT OF INFINITY</h4>

<p>The idea of infinity arises in several different contexts. Most of the applications to which we shall refer in this paper belong to one or other of the following six categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>The sequence of natural numbers, 1, 2, 3, ..., is said to be infinite.

<li>In geometry, the number of points on a line is said to be infinite.

<li>In mathematics, many example occur of sequences of numbers which <i>tend</i> to infinity.

<li>It is often assumed that <i>time</i> is infinite, in the sense that it had no beginning, or will have no end, or both.

<li>Likewise, <i>space</i> is often assumed to be infinite in extent.

<li>Some theories of cosmology suppose that the amount of <i>matter</i> in the universe, i.e. the number of stars or of atomic particles, is infinite.
</ol>
<p>It is important to distinguish between the last two of these ideas. If the number of stars is infinite, then so must be the volume of space, for space must be bigger than the total volume of all the stars. But an infinite space does not necessarily imply that the number of objects it contains is unlimited; perhaps only a part of space is populated, with an infinite volume being unoccupied .</p>

<p>Modern astronomers do not agree on whether or not space is infinite. Books on cosmology display much detailed knowledge of the history and structure of the universe, but appear to find the issue of infinity difficult to decide. Mathematicians tell us that the question is closely related to the average <i>curvature</i> of space, and everything depends upon whether this curvature is positive, zero or negative. If it is positive, we are told, the volume of space is finite, but if it is zero or negative the volume must be infinite. It turns out actually to be very close to zero, making it difficult to determine by observation or measurement which sort of universe we live in. Many of the formulae in cosmology must therefore be given in three different forms, so that the correct version can be chosen when we do eventually discover whether the value of <i>k</i> is +1, 0 or -1.</p>

<p>The question of the finiteness of time seems equally uncertain; most cosmologists now believe that the universe began with a big bang, all its material content coming into being at a single point in a colossal explosion, and with time itself beginning at this first moment. But opinion is divided on whether it will end with some sort of &quot;big crunch&quot;, with everything finally ceasing to exist in a mammoth <i>implosion</i>.</p>

<p>It is a surprising fact that cosmologists do not concern themselves greatly with the question of the finiteness of our universe. They give us the three formulae, corresponding to the three possible values of <i>k</i>, and leave it at that. Indeed some books on the subject fail to state clearly whether particular arguments apply to an &quot;open&quot; or a &quot;closed&quot; universe, as if it did not really matter. Many have no reference to &quot;infinity&quot; in their index. Surely few questions are more significant than whether the universe is finite or infinite.</p>

<p>At one time there seemed to be a strong argument against the number of stars being infinite. A simple calculation shows that if it is, then the whole night-sky should be ablaze with light. The surfaces of the stars are, on average, as bright as the surface of the sun, and if they are infinitely numerous it can easily be shown that any line of sight will eventually terminate on a star, so that the whole sky will shine as brightly as the sun. It can be argued that the most distant stars might have their light dimmed by passing through gas or dust on its way to us, but if this were the case, the gas itself would be raised to such a temperature that it too would shine with this same brilliance. This problem was known as &quot;Olbers' Paradox&quot;, after Heinrich Olbers (1758-1840). But it has now been resolved; even if the universe were infinite, we know that its <i>expansion</i> would provide an explanation for the darkness of the night-sky. Distant stars are dimmed not because of intervening matter, but because they are moving away from us, and the wavelength of their light is increased, and its energy reduced, by this motion. So Olbers' effect does not now present an obstacle to those who believe in an infinite universe. But here again it is surprising that taking the number of stars to be infinite is an assumption that can be adopted or discarded at pleasure, without considering whether it should be ruled out on logical grounds.</p>

<h4>MATHEMATICIANS' INFINITY</h4>

<p>The idea of infinity has been used increasingly over the centuries by mathematicians, and in general they have been more circumspect than have astronomers in their use of the word. The natural numbers clearly have no upper limit; the process of counting the numbers can never be completed. And if I name a number, however large, you can always name a larger one. So we can agree that the class of numbers is <i>unlimited</i>. We might even allow the class to be called &quot;infinite&quot;. But it is a mistake to say that the <i>number</i> of its members is &quot;equal to infinity&quot; for infinity cannot itself be a number. It can be defined only as something &quot;greater than any number we can name&quot;.</p>

<p>Modern mathematicians  make much use of &quot;infinite sequences&quot; of numbers, but during the nineteenth century they carefully defined their concepts in this field to avoid using the word &quot;infinity&quot; as if it were indeed a number. To take a simple example, if a sequence is defined so that the <i>n</i>th term is 1/<i>n</i>, we get the values 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ... as <i>n</i> takes the values 1, 2, 3, ... The fractions get closer and closer to 0, but never quite reach it. We disallow the statement &quot;the <i>n</i>th term of the sequence <i>equals</i> 0 when <i>n</i> equals infinity&quot;, but instead  we say &quot;the <i>limit</i> of the sequence is 0 as <i>n</i> <i>tends</i> to infinity&quot;. This is then carefully defined as follows: &quot;For any quantity <i>q</i>, however small, there exists a value of <i>n</i> such that every term of the sequence after the <i>n</i>th differs from 0 by less than <i>q</i>&quot;. This is perfectly explicit, and makes no reference to the number infinity. Likewise, when considering continuous variables, we disallow the shorthand form &quot;1/0 equals infinity&quot;, and we say rather, if <i>y</i> = 1/<i>x</i>, then &quot;<i>y</i> tends to infinity as <i>x</i> tends to 0&quot;, and this is rigorously defined to mean &quot;For any quantity Q, however large, there exists a value of <i>x</i> such that <i>y</i> is greater than Q whenever <i>x</i> is numerically less than this fixed value&quot;. In this way modern mathematics allows us to discuss infinite sequences in a way which is logically sound.</p>

<p>But other branches of mathematics have found it necessary approach the concept of infinity more directly, and to adopt the notion of a &quot;completed infinity&quot;, and as a result have become dogged by paradox. They begin by defining carefully what is meant by two numbers being <i>equal</i>; if the elements of two classes of objects can be put into one-to-one correspondence with each other, then they must contain equal numbers of elements.  If every seat on an aircraft is occupied by a passenger, and every passenger has a seat, then the number of passengers must equal the number of seats. But difficulties arise when this definition is applied to unlimited classes such as the natural numbers; here is a very simple example of such a paradox. Mathematicians use the symbol &quot;Aleph-0&quot; to represent the infinity we would obtain if we could count all the natural numbers. But because every number can be multiplied by two, the natural numbers can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the <i>even</i> numbers, as the following lists show:</p>

<p><pre>
   Natural Numbers   1  2  3  4  5  6  ....
   Even Numbers      2  4  6  8  10 12 ....</pre></p>

<p>It follows from this that the number of <i>even</i> numbers must also be equal to Aleph-0, according to this one-to-one definition of "equality".  What sort of a collection is it that still contains the same number of elements after we have removed half of them? And what sort of a number (apart from 0) is equal to twice itself?</p>

<p>The paradoxes become even more perplexing when we consider fractional numbers, such as 1/2, 5/8 or 999/1000. It is clear that the number of fractions between 0 and 1 must be unlimited, for it is always possible to find a new fraction between two given fractions, however close together they are. (To satisfy the curious, this can be done simply by adding the tops and adding the bottoms; thus 5/17 lies between 2/7 and 3/10.) And it is not difficult to show that the fractions between 0 and 1 can, in fact, be put into one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers, so that the number of such fractions must be Aleph-0. But it can also be shown that the whole collection of fractions, including &quot;improper&quot; fractions such as six and a half, or two thousand and nine tenths, can also be made to stand in one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers, and so their number must be Aleph-0. So there are Aleph-0 fractions between 0 and 1, another Aleph-0 between 1 and 2, and so on, and yet the total of all these infinities is no more than any one of them. We have another puzzling formula: Aleph-0 remains unchanged when we multiply it by itself.</p>

<p>The ancient Greeks realised that fractional numbers are needed in order to describe the lengths of lines, or to indicate the position of a point on a line. Because we can always find a fraction between any given pair of fractions, it follows that the complete set of fractions has no gaps in it. So the class of all fractions should be sufficient to enable us to express accurately the length of any line. This was recognised by the Greeks more than 500 years B.C., and it came as a shock to them when the great mathematician Pythagoras showed that, in fact, it is just not true. If a square has sides of length one inch, then Pythagoras' well known theorem shows that the length of the diagonal must be the <i>square root</i> of 2, and he proved that this number is not, in fact, a fraction. (His proof was a remarkable achievement in its day, but is not difficult to comprehend today. Suppose the fraction <i>m/n</i> does equal the square root of two, and suppose it is in its lowest terms, i.e. it does not need cancelling. Then its square must equal 2, i.e. <i>m</i> squared over <i>n</i> squared equals 2, and so <i>m</i> squared is twice <i>n</i> squared. This shows that <i>m</i> squared is an even number, and so <i>m</i> is even, and <i>m</i> squared must divide by 4. It follows that <i>n</i> squared must divide by 2, and so <i>n</i> also must be even. But this contradicts our stipulation that <i>m/n</i> does not need cancelling, and the contradiction shows our original supposition to be false; the square root of 2 cannot be a fraction.)</p>

<p>So the class of fractions, although it contains no gaps, is not adequate for describing the lengths of lines. For some lines we need also numbers such as the square root of two, which cannot be expressed as fractions. Until quite recently this presented an intriguing puzzle. But what seems to be overlooked, even today, is that when we deal with the real world of geometrical figures, fractions <i>are</i> sufficient for specifying the length of any line we have measured. Measurements necessarily must be made to some limited degree of accuracy, depending on our method and the care we take. However small the inaccuracy we will allow, the length of a line can be expressed as a fraction (or what amounts to the same thing, a decimal) to whatever precision our measuring technique will allow. The length of the diagonal of an ideal square may indeed be &quot;irrational&quot;, but this is of no concern to us when we measure the diagonals of real squares.</p>

<p>Undeterred by the paradoxes they were unearthing, mathematicians in the nineteenth century studied the infinite numbers in detail. They accepted it as true, despite the apparent contradiction, that the number of <i>even numbers</i> was indeed the same as the number of all the natural numbers. As we have seen, the number of <i>fractional</i> numbers then turns out to be the same again, and they began to suspect that all infinite numbers must equal each other. So it was a surprise when Cantor (1845-1918) showed that the class of <i>real</i> numbers, which includes also the irrationals, contains a <i>larger</i> infinity than Aleph-0. The criterion he used was again to ask whether this class could be put into one-to-one relationship with the natural numbers, in other words whether it could be <i>counted</i>. The set of even numbers, or the the set of fractions, are said to contain Aleph-0 members because they <i>can</i> be counted (in theory, although we could never end the process), while the class of <i>real</i> numbers <i>cannot</i>. So Cantor introduced us to a whole heirarchy of infinite numbers, Aleph-0, Aleph-1, ..., which are not equal to each other.</p>

<h4>INFINITY IN THE REAL WORLD</h4>

<p>The world of the Pure Mathematician is far removed from the real world. In the real world there is no difficulty finding the length of the diagonal of a square and expressing this as a decimal, but in the perfect world of Pure Mathematics this cannot be done. In the real world we know the process of counting the natural numbers can never be completed, so that the <i>number</i> of numbers is without meaning, while the mathematician finds it necessary to say that if the process <i>were</i> completed, the number would be found to be Aleph-0. These are harmless follies; what the mathematician gets up to inside his ivory tower need not concern those outside.</p>

<p>But the mathematician's ideal world did impinge on reality at the beginning of the twentieth century when Russell (1872-1970) attempted to reduce all mathematical reasoning to simple logic. Even the natural numbers themselves could be defined in terms of a simpler concept, but to make this possible Russell found it necessary to assume that the number of real objects in the universe is itself infinite. Here again I find it astonishing that he made this assumption so glibly. He called the principle his &quot;Axiom of Infinity&quot;. Now an &quot;axiom&quot; is something which is self-evident, unlike a &quot;postulate&quot;, which is assumed for convenience even though it is not self-evident. Why did Russell not refer to the principle as his &quot;Postulate of Infinity&quot;? To me it is far from self-evident that there are an infinite number of things in the universe; in fact I cannot see that the statement has any meaning. Infinity is an indispensible concept in Pure Mathematics, but is it not meaningless when applied to the enumeration of real things? Nature, however, retaliated for Russell's cavalier assumption that it was infinite. The theory of classes which he developed from this assumption eventually showed some unacceptable inconsistencies which he could avoid only by making arbitrary restrictions on the types of class which the theory would allow. To my mind it represented an elaborate <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> proving that the number of objects in the universe can not be infinite.</p>

<p>There is another strong argument that to talk of a universe containing an infinite number of particles is without meaning. It has often been pointed out that, in such a universe, anything which <i>can</i> exist without trangressing the rules of nature, <i>must</i> of necessity exist somewhere, and anything which <i>can</i> possibly happen, <i>will</i> happen, So there must somewhere be another planet which its inhabitants call &quot;Earth&quot;, with a country called &quot;England&quot; whose capital is &quot;London&quot;, containing a cathedral called &quot;St. Paul's&quot;. Indeed there must be an infinite number of such planets, identical in every respect except that the heights of these copies of St. Paul's differ among themselves. Is this not sufficiently ridiculous to convince believers in an infinite universe that they are wrong? Is not this a further indication that to talk of an infinity of material objects must be meaningless?</p>

<p>      As we have shown above, mathematicians have tried to avoid the use of infinite magnitudes wherever possible. They have succeeded in deflecting such ideas as series which &quot;tend to infinity&quot;, or the number of points on a line being &quot;equal to infinity&quot;, by re-stating propositions of this sort in terms which do not require use of the word &quot;infinite&quot;. Cantor and others were not able to treat in a similar fashion their discussion of the equality or inequality of the different infinities they had discovered, but it must be conceded that their arguments had no relevence in the real world of material particles and real magnitudes. Indeed, their discussion of the various &quot;orders of infinity&quot; which they introduced into Pure Mathematics, Aleph-0, Aleph-1 and so on, is no more than a fascinating game whose rules, such as that defining &quot;equality&quot; in terms of one-to-one relationships, are quite arbitrary; a different definition of equality would result in a different pattern of relationships between the various infinities. Only when attempts are made to relate the concept of infinity to objects in the real world, as Russell did with his  Axiom of Infinity, do we meet insurmountable logical contradictions.</p>

<h4>COSMOLOGY</h4>

<p>      At the time of writing, physicists wrestling with the fundamental laws of nature are being confronted with worrying infinities which they know must indicate something wrong with their theories. The twentieth century has seen the birth of two remarkably successful theories, Einstein's General Relativity, and Quantum Electrodynamics. The first of these relates to matter on the largest of scales, the stars and galaxies and the universe as a whole, while the second gives a clear insight into processes at the sub-atomic level. But many attempts to combine them into one super-theory have failed because they seem to throw up the answer &quot;infinity&quot; when asked various types of question. Physicists know such answers must show one or both of these theories to be wrong or incomplete, despite the undoubted success of each in its own field. Thus many physicists are tacetly acknowledging that infinities cannot occur in the real world. It seems a pity that they do not convince their cosmologist colleagues of this point, for many thinkers, professional and amateur, cling to a belief that the number of bodies in the universe, as well as the volume of space, are infinite.</p>

<p>      Now it is easy to understand the pressures that existed in earlier times to accept such beliefs. In past centuries it was thought the only alternative to an infinite volume was one which had a <i>boundary</i>, some sort of screen which would loom up in front of anyone who had travelled far enough. Both these beliefs seemed implausible, but the infinite universe was the lesser of the two evils. This dilemma forms the subject for the first of Kant's well-known &quot;antimonies&quot;. He argues that pure reason leads inescapably to the conclusion that space and time are finite, and equally inescapably to the conclusion that they are infinite. He offers no solution to this contradiction. But in recent years we have not needed to make a choice between these two unpalatable beliefs. Gauss and Riemann demonstrated in the middle of the nineteenth century that Euclid's is not the only possible geometry, and that there is no reason why the geometry of our universe should necessarily obey Euclid's rules. And some years later, Einstein showed that our space indeed does not abide by them. It is the deviations from Euclidean geometry which explain gravitation, and these deviations, although very small in the part of space we can explore directly, have been detected experimentally. So now that we are freed from the shackles of Euclidean geometry, there is no difficulty in reconciling a <i>finite</i> space with the absence of any <i>boundary</i>. We cannot actually visualise a three-dimensional space or a four-dimensional space-time which is finite but nevertheless unbounded, but we have a perfect two-dimensional analogy when we picture the surface of a sphere. The earth's surface, for example, has no boundary in the sense that a country has a boundary, and yet its area is strictly finite and calculable. Einstein's General Relativity does not decide for us whether in fact our universe has this form, but if it has then the Kantian contradiction vanishes. Neither theory nor observation has yet proved adequate to decide conclusively whether our universe is of this type, but Einstein believed strongly that it is, and that the world we live in is strictly finite in all respects.  </p>

<p>      Belief that the universe has an infinite volume is usually accompanied by belief that it contains an infinite amount of matter. My own view is that, since logic and geometry no longer require the first of these assumptions, and the second is untenable without it, by far the most satisfactory assumption to make is that all aspects of the real world, its volume and its content, are each finite. This also absolves us from the need to explain what we mean by an infinity in the real world, or to face the logical contradictions which real infinities always seem to imply. The idea of infinity is useful and fascinating in the world of Pure Mathematics, where it is a product only of the human mind, but cannot be applied without paradox in the real world. Human thought possesses the remarkable capacity of <i>generalisation</i>, a process which is totally absent in the outside world of inanimate matter. Man can embrace in a single word or a single concept a flock of sheep, the population of a country, or the totality of particles in the universe. He can contemplate the fact that the natural numbers are unlimited without having to bring to mind more than a finite sub-set of them. But no such distinction can be drawn among real objects, all of which exist whether or not they are represented in a human brain. We can discuss the infinity of the natural numbers by thinking of them collectively; we cannot contemplate them all individually. But the particles of the universe all exist individually, and it is meaningless to assert that their number is infinite.</p>

<p>And what about time? Observations appear to point clearly to the universe having come into existence at a finite time in the past, as a big bang, but is unable to decide the question of the big crunch. Calculations depend critically on the average density of gravitating matter throughout space; while the amount of visible matter appears with our present knowledge to be somewhat less than that required to recollapse the universe, additional forms of invisible matter are constantly being discovered or suggested. Observation fails us, and logic cannot help, but symmetry and tidiness might provide some guidance. Is there not something untidy about a universe which starts from a point, and finishes all spread out, particularly if one remembers that all the simple processes of physics are reversible? We know that the three dimensions of space do not have their own identity, but exist only as an imaginary cross section of space-time. We are taught this not only by Relativity theory, which shows that the direction in which the cross-section is taken depends upon our state of motion, but also by the realisation that the concept of a &quot;now&quot;, which specifies which cross-section applies to the world as we perceive it at a particular moment, is purely subjective. In the absence of intelligent creatures, such three-dimensional cross-sections have no significance. These considerations suggest strongly that the universe is best conceived as a finite boundless four-dimensional space-time. If we picture the analogous surface of a sphere, the circles of latitude can be taken to represent space (but only one of the three dimensions can be shown), and the meridians to represent time.</p>

<br><center><img  src="inf1.gif" width="246" height="230" alt="boundary conditions"></center>

<p> The belief that time &quot;flows&quot; and things &quot;happen&quot;  is due solely to man's limitations. Translating this picture back to our usual viewpoint,  we see our three-dimensional universe coming into existence in the big bang, corresponding to the North pole of our spherical analogy, expanding to a maximum volume over some tens of billions of years, and then collapsing into the big crunch at the South pole. The picture has a satisfying symmetry which, in the absence of any real evidence to the contrary, makes it pleasing and plausible.</p>

<p> The argument of the previous paragraph has been severely condensed, because a much fuller treatment will be found in the author's book <a href="http://www.lutterworth.com/lp/titles/time.htm">Time, Science and Philosophy</a>, which readers may like to consult. You will also find the theme developed in two other essays on this website, <a href="collapse.htm">The Collapse of the Universe</a> and <a href="ps.htm">Postscript to &quot;Time, Science and Philosophy&quot;.</a>
