METHODS: We investigatedthe potential of proton MRS to detect low NAA outside of the temporal lobes inpatients with non-lesional partial extratemporal epilepsy. Proton MRspectroscopic imaging (MRSI) data of both frontal lobes and central/postcentralregions were obtained in 20 such patients and 16 normal control subjects. Theepileptogenic region was determined by an extensive clinical-EEG investigation,including the recording of habitual seizures in each patient, and intracranialEEG recordings in 10 patients. RESULTS: The relative NAA resonance intensities(i.e., NAA/phosphocreatine plus creatine (CR(t)), NAA/choline-containingmetabolites (Cho(t)) and NAA/Cr(t) + Cho(t)), were all significantly reducedthroughout the spectroscopic image as compared with that of the controls.Furthermore, reduction of the NAA ratios was greater in the epileptogenicregion as compared with the nonepileptogenic regions, on EEG investigation.CONCLUSIONS: In vivo proton MRSI of patients with nonlesional partialextratemporal epilepsy detected evidence of widespread neuronal damage ordysfunction that was greatest in the region of seizure focus.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Cerebral-Cortex-metabolism;*Epilepsies,-Partial-diagnosis;*Magnetic-Resonance-Spectroscopy-diagnostic-use<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adult-; Aspartic-Acid-analogs-and-derivatives;Aspartic-Acid-metabolism; Choline-metabolism; Electrodes,-Implanted;Epilepsies,-Partial-metabolism; Epilepsy,-Frontal-Lobe-diagnosis;Epilepsy,-Frontal-Lobe-metabolism; Phosphocreatine-metabolism; Protons-<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  analogs-and-derivatives; metabolism; diagnosis; diagnostic-use<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  0; 56-84-8; 62-49-7; 67-07-2; 997-55-7<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  Protons; Aspartic-Acid; Choline; Phosphocreatine;N-acetylaspartate<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98237153<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 2 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  Neuronal metabolic dysfunction in patients with cortical developmentalmalformations: a proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging study.<p>AUTHOR:  Li,-L-M; Cendes,-F; Bastos,-A-C; Andermann,-F; Dubeau,-F;Arnold,-D-L<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, McGillUniversity, and the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, Quebec,Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Neurology. 1998 Mar; 50(3): 755-9<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0028-3878<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  Cortical developmental malformations are best diagnosed by MRI andare often the cause of refractory epilepsy. Little is known about the metaboliccell function on MR spectroscopy of these types of brain anomaly. We studied 23patients with cortical developmental malformations and refractory epilepsyusing proton MR spectroscopic imaging. Mean age was 28 years (range, 9 to 47years). The lesions examined were focal cortical dysplasia (n = 5), heterotopia(four band, six periventricular, two subcortical), polymicrogyria (n = 3),tuberous sclerosis (n = 2), and polymicrogyria and periventricular nodularheterotopia (n = 1). We measured the relative signal intensity ofN-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) in the lesion, in the perilesional region,and in the region remote from the visible lesion. The values were compared withthose from similar brain regions of 25 normal control subjects. The mean NAA/Crz score values for the 23 patients were as follows: lesion, -2.20 +/- 0.32(mean +/- SE), n = 21; perilesional region, -1.01 +/- 0.38, n = 15; and distantregion, -0.03 +/- 0.34, n = 18 (p &lt; 0.0002). Despite the presence of a largenumber of neurons, heterotopia showed a relative decrease of NAA in somepatients, suggesting that the neurons present were dysfunctional. The maximalNAA/Cr decrease, indicating metabolic dysfunction, colocalized to thestructural malformation as defined by MRI and extended to normal-appearingregions adjacent to the visible lesion.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Cerebral-Cortex-abnormalities;*Cerebral-Cortex-growth-and-development;*Developmental-Disabilities-metabolism; *Neurons-metabolism<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Adult-;Aspartic-Acid-analogs-and-derivatives; Aspartic-Acid-metabolism;Brain-metabolism; Cerebral-Cortex-metabolism; Child-; Creatine-metabolism;Developmental-Disabilities-diagnosis; Developmental-Disabilities-pathology;Electroencephalography-; Magnetic-Resonance-Spectroscopy; Middle-Age;Reference-Values<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  analogs-and-derivatives; metabolism; abnormalities;growth-and-development; diagnosis; pathology<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  56-84-8; 57-00-1; 997-55-7<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  Aspartic-Acid; Creatine; N-acetylaspartate<p>SUBSET:  Abridged-Index-Medicus; Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98180565<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 3 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  The significance of electrocorticographic findings in focal corticaldysplasia: a review of their clinical, electrophysiological and neurochemicalcharacteristics.<p>AUTHOR:  Dubeau,-F; Palmini,-A; Fish,-D; Avoli,-M; Gambardella,-A;Spreafico,-R; Andermann,-F<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, MontrealNeurological Hospital and Institute, McGill University, Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Electroencephalogr-Clin-Neurophysiol-Suppl. 1998; 4877-96<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0424-8155<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  IRELAND<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Cerebral-Cortex-physiopathology;*Electroencephalography-; *Epilepsies,-Partial-physiopathology<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Cerebral-Cortex-abnormalities;Cerebral-Cortex-chemistry; Epilepsies,-Partial-metabolism;Epilepsies,-Partial-pathology; Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article; Review; Review,-Tutorial<p>SUBHEADINGS:  abnormalities; chemistry; physiopathology; metabolism;pathology<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  99134936<p><p>Record 4 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  Mutations in a gene encoding a novel protein tyrosine phosphatase causeprogressive myoclonus epilepsy.<p>AUTHOR:  Minassian,-B-A; Lee,-J-R; Herbrick,-J-A; Huizenga,-J; Soder,-S;Mungall,-A-J; Dunham,-I; Gardner,-R; Fong,-C-Y; Carpenter,-S; Jardim,-L;Satishchandra,-P; Andermann,-E; Snead,-O-C; Lopes-Cendes,-I; Tsui,-L-C;Delgado-Escueta,-A-V; Rouleau,-G-A; Scherer,-S-W<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Genetics, The Hospital for Sick Children,University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Nat-Genet. 1998 Oct; 20(2): 171-4<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  1061-4036<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  Lafora's disease (LD; OMIM 254780) is an autosomal recessive form ofprogressive myoclonus epilepsy characterized by seizures and cumulativeneurological deterioration. Onset occurs during late childhood and usuallyresults in death within ten years of the first symptoms. With few exceptions,patients follow a homogeneous clinical course despite the existence of geneticheterogeneity. Biopsy of various tissues, including brain, revealedcharacteristic polyglucosan inclusions called Lafora bodies, which suggested LDmight be a generalized storage disease. Using a positional cloning approach, wehave identified at chromosome 6q24 a novel gene, EPM2A, that encodes a proteinwith consensus amino acid sequence indicative of a protein tyrosine phosphatase(PTP). mRNA transcripts representing alternatively spliced forms of EPM2A werefound in every tissue examined, including brain. Six distinct DNA sequencevariations in EPM2A in nine families, and one homozygous microdeletion inanother family, have been found to cosegregate with LD. These mutations arepredicted to cause deleterious effects in the putative protein product, namedlaforin, resulting in LD.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Chromosomes,-Human,-Pair-6;*Epilepsies,-Myoclonic-genetics; *Mutation-;*Protein-Tyrosine-Phosphatase-genetics<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Alternative-Splicing; Amino-Acid-Sequence;Base-Sequence; Chromosome-Mapping; Consensus-Sequence;Epilepsies,-Myoclonic-enzymology; Genotype-; Linkage-Genetics;Molecular-Sequence-Data; Pedigree-; RNA,-Messenger-metabolism<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't;Support,-U.S.-Gov't,-P.H.S.<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  enzymology; genetics; metabolism<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  0; 0; EC 3.1.3.48<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  EPM2A-protein; RNA,-Messenger;Protein-Tyrosine-Phosphatase<p>SECONDARY SOURCE IDENTIFIER:  GENBANK/AF084535;GENBANK/L14849SWISSPROT/AF003534; SWISSPROT/O00633; SWISSPROT/P18031;SWISSPROT/Q13496<p>CONTRACT OR GRANT NUMBERS:  5P01NS21908NSNINDS<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98442653<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 5 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  Morphometric analysis of the temporal lobe in temporal lobe epilepsy.<p>AUTHOR:  Lee,-J-W; Andermann,-F; Dubeau,-F; Bernasconi,-A; MacDonald,-D;Evans,-A; Reutens,-D-C<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  McConnell Brain Imaging Center, Montreal NeurologicalInstitute and Hospital, McGill University, PQ, Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Epilepsia. 1998 Jul; 39(7): 727-36<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0013-9580<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  PURPOSE: Using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), weexamined the temporal neocortex and the underlying white matter in patientswith unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and in control subjects. METHODS:The images of 27 patients and 42 control subjects were registered intostereotaxic space, corrected for image intensity inhomogeneity, andautomatically segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) over a predetermined extent of the temporal lobe. The surface between thegray matter and CSF was extracted, indices of curvature (IOC) of the surfacewere calculated, and a frequency histogram of the IOC was obtained. RESULTS:There was significant bilateral reduction in the total volume of the temporallobe and in the volume of gray matter. White matter volume was significantlyreduced only in the temporal lobe ipsilateral to the seizure focus. There weresignificant changes in the position and amplitude of peaks in the frequencyhistogram of the IOC. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of gray matter was negativelycorrelated with duration of epilepsy, suggesting that neocortical changes maybe a consequence of seizures. Changes in the frequency histogram of the IOCsuggested an additional alteration in the surface morphology of the temporallobe in TLE, possibly related to sulcal widening.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Epilepsy,-Temporal-Lobe-diagnosis;*Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging-statistics-and-numerical-data;*Temporal-Lobe-anatomy-and-histology<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Adult-; Algorithms-;Analysis-of-Variance; Brain-anatomy-and-histology; Cerebrospinal-Fluid; Child-;Epilepsy,-Temporal-Lobe-pathology; Epilepsy,-Temporal-Lobe-physiopathology;Laterality-physiology; Middle-Age; Neocortex-pathology;Neocortex-physiopathology; Seizures,-Febrile-diagnosis;Temporal-Lobe-pathology; Temporal-Lobe-physiopathology<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  anatomy-and-histology; diagnosis; pathology; physiopathology;physiology; statistics-and-numerical-data<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98333976<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 6 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  Nocturnal temporal lobe epilepsy.<p>AUTHOR:  Bernasconi,-A; Andermann,-F; Cendes,-F; Dubeau,-F; Andermann,-E;Olivier,-A<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, McGillUniversity, Quebec, Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Neurology. 1998 Jun; 50(6): 1772-7<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0028-3878<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  OBJECTIVE: To analyze clinical, electrophysiologic, andneuroradiologic characteristics and prognostic factors in a group of patientswith temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and complex partial seizures (CPS) occurringexclusively or predominantly after they fall asleep or before they awaken.BACKGROUND: CPS arising during sleep are classically identified with frontallobe epilepsy. TLE associated with seizures occurring only or predominantlyduring sleep (nocturnal TLE) is less common. METHODS: From a series of patientswith refractory TLE studied between 1980 and 1996, the authors identified 26patients (15 men) with nonlesional nocturnal TLE (mean age, 40 years). Clinicaland laboratory characteristics of these individuals were studied and comparedwith a group of 72 age-matched, randomly selected patients with nonlesional TLEand predominantly diurnal seizures (diurnal TLE). RESULTS: Mean age at seizureonset was similar for both groups (16.3 versus 18.7 years). In the nocturnalTLE group, 2 of 26 patients had a positive family history of epilepsy, 18reported an aura, 4 presented with CPS in clusters, 11 had unilateral and 15bilateral temporal EEG abnormalities, and 14 of 21 studied had unilateralmesial temporal atrophy. None of these factors differed significantly in thetwo groups except for higher frequency of the following in the diurnal TLEgroup compared with the nocturnal TLE group: positive family history forepilepsy (33% versus 8%, p=0.01), estimated frequency of seizures (median, 14versus 2 per month; p &lt; 0.01), and presence of antecedent febrileconvulsions (33% versus 11%, p=0.04). In the nocturnal TLE group, eightpatients underwent surgical therapy and became seizure free (follow-up, &gt; 12months). Only two were seizure free on medication. CONCLUSIONS: Infrequent andnonclustered seizures, rare family history of epilepsy, and low prevalence ofchildhood febrile convulsions characterize nocturnal TLE. Within the TLEs, thenocturnal TLE form seems to have a better surgical prognosis.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Circadian-Rhythm-physiology;*Epilepsy,-Temporal-Lobe-physiopathology<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adult-; Electroencephalography-;Epilepsy,-Temporal-Lobe-diagnosis; Epilepsy,-Temporal-Lobe-surgery; Incidence-;Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging; Middle-Age; Prevalence-;Seizures,-Febrile-epidemiology; Treatment-Outcome<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  physiology; diagnosis; physiopathology; surgery; epidemiology<p>SUBSET:  Abridged-Index-Medicus; Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98295483<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 7 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  Familial temporal lobe epilepsy: a clinically heterogeneous syndrome.<p>AUTHOR:  Cendes,-F; Lopes-Cendes,-I; Andermann,-E; Andermann,-F<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Human Genetics, McGill University, Montreal,Quebec, Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Neurology. 1998 Feb; 50(2): 554-7<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0028-3878<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  We describe the clinical characteristics of a group of patients withfamilial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in 11 kindreds with 36 affectedindividuals identified and investigated at the Montreal Neurological Hospital.Seizure types were simple partial (n = 20), complex partial (n = 29), and raregeneralized tonic-clonic. Simple and complex partial seizures were infrequentor well controlled by anticonvulsant medication in 17 of 29 patients (59%) andwithout optimal response to medical therapy in 12 of 29 patients (41%).Pedigree analysis suggested autosomal dominant inheritance with incompletepenetrance.

LHON is a maternally inherited optic neuropathy that primarily affectsadolescent males. It is usually associated with one of three mtDNA mutations:G3460A, G11778A, or T14484C. Definition of recurrence risks for the T14484Cmutation previously has not been possible due to the relative scarcity offamilies with this mutation. We obtained blood samples from index patients andtheir consenting family members, all of whom were of French Canadian ancestryand screened for LHON mutations in mtDNA. Referring ophthalmologists furnishedclinical summaries and patients provided pedigree data. T14484C was the mostcommon mutation in the pedigrees analyzed and was always homoplasmic. In thesepedigrees, the ratio of affected males to females was 8:1. Median age at onsetfor males was 19 years (95th percentile, 40.8 years; range, 6 to 48 years).Some improvement of vision was observed in 58% of patients. Recurrence risks tobrothers were 28%, sisters 5%, nephews 30%, nieces 3%, male matrilineal firstcousins 19%, and female matrilineal first cousins 4%. Recurrence risks tobrothers and nephews were not different; however, recurrence risks to brothersand male cousins and to nephews and male cousins were significantly different.There were no differences in recurrence risks to sisters and nieces or toeither group compared with their female cousins. Affected females did not havemore affected children than unaffected females. The clinical characteristics ofFrench Canadian patients with T14484C LHON were strikingly similar to those inprevious reports, suggesting that recurrence risks are generalizable to otherT14484C LHON populations for genetic counseling of T14484C LHON families.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Optic-Atrophies,-Hereditary-genetics;*Point-Mutation<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Adult-; Age-of-Onset; Canada-; Child-;France-ethnology; Middle-Age; Optic-Atrophies,-Hereditary-epidemiology;Optic-Atrophies,-Hereditary-physiopathology; Pedigree-; Phenotype-;Recurrence-; Risk-Factors; Sex-Characteristics<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  ethnology; epidemiology; genetics; physiopathology<p>SUBSET:  Abridged-Index-Medicus; Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98145359<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 9 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  Cortical dysplasia: an immunocytochemical study of three patients.<p>AUTHOR:  Spreafico,-R; Battaglia,-G; Arcelli,-P; Andermann,-F; Dubeau,-F;Palmini,-A; Olivier,-A; Villemure,-J-G; Tampieri,-D; Avanzini,-G; Avoli,-M<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Istituto Nazionale Neurologico C.

We report an immunocytochemical investigation oncortical tissue from three surgically treated patients, 20, 38, and 14 yearsold, with intractable epilepsy due to cortical dysplasia. The studies wereperformed using antibodies recognizing cytoskeletal proteins, calcium-bindingproteins, and some subunits of glutamate receptors. The specimens from thethree patients displayed common features: (1) focal cytoarchitecturalabnormalities with an increased number of giant pyramidal neurons through allcortical layers except layer I; (2) large, round-shaped balloon cells mainlyconcentrated in the deepest part of the cortex and in the white matter; (3) adecrease of calcium binding protein immunopositive gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA)ergic neurons; and (4) abnormal baskets of parvalbumin-positive terminalsaround the excitatory (pyramidal and large, round-shaped) neurons. These dataprovide evidence that the epileptogenicity in these types of cortical dysplasiais due to an increase in excitatory neurons coupled with a decrease inGABAergic interneurons.<p>COMMENTS:  Comment In: Neurology. 1998 Jan;50(1):8-10<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Brain-Chemistry; *Cerebral-Cortex-pathology;*Epilepsies,-Partial-pathology<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Adult-;Calcium-Binding-Protein,-Vitamin-D-Dependent-analysis;Epilepsies,-Partial-diagnosis; Epilepsies,-Partial-surgery; GABA-analysis;Immunohistochemistry-; Interneurons-chemistry; Interneurons-pathology;Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging; Microtubule-Associated-Proteins-analysis;Nerve-Tissue-Proteins-analysis; Parvalbumins-analysis;Pyramidal-Cells-chemistry; Pyramidal-Cells-pathology<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  analysis; pathology; diagnosis; surgery; chemistry<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 56-12-2<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  Calcium-Binding-Protein,-Vitamin-D-Dependent;Microtubule-Associated-Proteins; Nerve-Tissue-Proteins; Parvalbumins;calbindin; calretinin; GABA<p>SUBSET:  Abridged-Index-Medicus; Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98103690<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 10 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  Anticipation in familial cavernous angioma: ascertainment bias orgenetic cause.<p>AUTHOR:  Siegel,-A-M; Andermann,-F; Badhwar,-A; Rouleau,-G-A; Dam,-M;Hopf,-H-C; Dichgans,-J; Sturzenegger,-M; Hopf,-N-J; Yasui,-N; Stepper,-F;Killer,-M; Vanneste,-J-A; Acciarri,-N; Drigo,-P; Christensen,-J; Braun,-V;Konu,-D; Andermann,-E<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Dartmouth College, Neurology, Hanover, New Hampshire,USA.<p>SOURCE:  Acta-Neurol-Scand. 1998 Dec; 98(6): 372-6<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0001-6314<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  DENMARK<p>ABSTRACT:  OBJECTIVES: Anticipation has been linked to unstable trinucleotiderepeats in many neurological disorders. We examined the hypothesis of geneticanticipation in familial cavernous angioma (FCA) of the central nervous system.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The mean ASO of affected individuals was compared betweensuccessive generations in 55 families. Intergenerational pair-wise comparisonswere employed to avoid several ascertainment biases. Regarding severity ofdisease both type of manifestation and number of cavernous angiomas werecompared between generations. RESULTS: The mean ASO decreased significantlyboth from the first to the second generation (31.6 vs 17.8 years; P = 0.000)and from the second to the third generation (17.8 vs 6.7 years; P = 0.002). Thepair-wise comparisons also showed significantly earlier ASO. No clear evidencefor anticipation with regard to severity of disease was found. CONCLUSIONS:Molecular genetic studies will determine whether trinucleotide repeats are theunderlying mechanism for our observation of anticipation in FCA.<p>COMMENTS:  Comment In: Acta Neurol Scand. 1998 Dec;98(6):369-71<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Anticipation,-Genetic;*Central-Nervous-System-Neoplasms-epidemiology;*Central-Nervous-System-Neoplasms-genetics;*Hemangioma,-Cavernous-epidemiology; *Hemangioma,-Cavernous-genetics<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Adult-; Age-of-Onset; Bias-Epidemiology;Child-<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article; Review; Review,-Tutorial<p>SUBHEADINGS:  epidemiology; genetics<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  99090791<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 11 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  Anticipation in familial cavernous angioma: a study of 52 families fromInternational Familial Cavernous Angioma Study.

An additional seven families are presented in which ADNFLEis unlinked to the CHRNA4 region on chromosome 20q13.2. Seven additionalsporadic cases showed no evidence of defective CHRNA4. One of the familiesshowed evidence of linkage to 15q24, close to the CHRNA3/CHRNA5/CHRNB4 cluster(maximum LOD score of 3.01 with D15S152). Recombination between ADNFLE andCHRNA4, linkage to 15q24 in one family, and exclusion from 15q24 and 20q13.2 inothers demonstrate genetic heterogeneity with at least three different genesfor ADNFLE. The CHRNA4 gene and the two known CHRNA4 mutations are responsiblefor only a minority of ADNFLE. Although the ADNFLE phenotype is clinicallyhomogeneous, there appear to be a variety of molecular defects responsible forthis disorder, which will provide a challenge to the understanding of the basicmechanism of epileptogenesis.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Chromosomes,-Human,-Pair-15;*Epilepsy,-Frontal-Lobe-genetics; *Genetic-Heterogeneity<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Chromosome-Mapping; Genes,-Dominant; Genetic-Markers;Lod-Score; Molecular-Sequence-Data; Mutation-; Periodicity-;Receptors,-Nicotinic-genetics<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  genetics<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  0; 0<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  Genetic-Markers; Receptors,-Nicotinic<p>SECONDARY SOURCE IDENTIFIER:  GENBANK/M83712; GENBANK/U62433; GENBANK/X07348;GENBANK/X07349; GENBANK/X07350; GENBANK/X07351; GENBANK/X07352; GENBANK/X07399;GENBANK/X68275<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98431796<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 13 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  Surgical treatment of epilepsy in tuberous sclerosis: strategies andresults in 18 patients.<p>AUTHOR:  Guerreiro,-M-M; Andermann,-F; Andermann,-E; Palmini,-A; Hwang,-P;Hoffman,-H-J; Otsubo,-H; Bastos,-A; Dubeau,-F; Snipes,-G-J; Olivier,-A;Rasmussen,-T<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, and MontrealNeurological Institute and Hospital, McGill University, Quebec, Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Neurology. 1998 Nov; 51(5): 1263-9<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0028-3878<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND: Seizures in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex(TSC) are often intractable to antiepileptic medications and searchinginvestigation may provide evidence that surgical treatment can be considered.OBJECTIVE: To review the results of investigation and surgical therapy, atreatment modality not generally considered in patients with medicallyrefractory seizures and TSC. METHODS: We report 18 patients (9 male) with TSCwho underwent surgical treatment of medically refractory epilepsy. Twelvepatients had a well-localized epileptogenic lesion and were treated bylesionectomy or focal resection. Resections were: 7 frontal, 4 temporal, 1frontotemporal, 1 occipital, and 1 frontoparietal. Four patients underwent morethan one operation. Six patients had corpus callosotomy (CC). RESULTS:Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 47 years. Outcome of the patients treated byresection was excellent in 7 (5 were seizure-free and 2 had auras only), goodin 1, fair in 3, and 1 was lost to follow-up. Best outcome was obtained inpatients who had focal seizures and good imaging and EEG correlation, althoughthey might have multiple seizure types, other imaging abnormalities, andmultifocal or generalized EEG findings. When there was no such correlation, CCwas found to be an option as five patients had at least some improvement andonly one showed no change. CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment of patients with TSCand intractable epilepsy is most effective when a single tuber or epileptogenicarea can be identified as the source of seizures and resected. This may bepossible even when other tubers or diffuse EEG abnormalities are present. Inpatients with unlocalizable epileptic abnormalities, palliation may be obtainedby CC.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Epilepsy-complications; *Epilepsy-surgery;*Tuberous-Sclerosis-complications; *Tuberous-Sclerosis-surgery<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Adult-; Age-of-Onset; Brain-pathology;Child-; Child,-Preschool; Electroencephalography-; Follow-Up-Studies; Infant-;Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging; Middle-Age; Reoperation-; Retrospective-Studies;Time-Factors; Treatment-Outcome<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  pathology; complications; surgery<p>SUBSET:  Abridged-Index-Medicus; Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  99034152<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 14 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  Case study: neurological brain waves causing serious behavioralbrainstorms.<p>AUTHOR:  Manford,-M; Cvejic,-H; Minde,-K; Andermann,-F; Taylor,-L; Savard,-G<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Clinical Neurology, Addenbrooke's Hospital,Cambridge, England.<p>SOURCE:  J-Am-Acad-Child-Adolesc-Psychiatry. 1998 Oct; 37(10): 1085-90<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0890-8567<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  A case highlighting the association of epilepsy with psychopathologyis reported. The patient suffered a rare and extreme behavioral disturbance,characterized by persistent disruptive behavior and intermittent bizarre andviolent outbursts. These outbursts often appeared purposeful, but some of themwere later diagnosed as ictal manifestations of temporal lobe epilepsy.Temporal lobectomy resulted in remission both of the epilepsy and of the morepersistent behavioral disturbance. lctal behavioral change was masked byinterictal behavioral disturbance, leading to delayed diagnosis and prolongedpsychosocial dysfunction. It is important to record the paroxysmal abnormalbehavior with simultaneous electroencephalographic recording if there is asuspicion of organic disease. Physical and psychosocial factors in therelationship between epilepsy and extreme psychiatric disturbance areconsidered. This case demonstrates how successful epilepsy treatment mayproduce amelioration of associated psychiatric disturbance.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:*Attention-Deficit-and-Disruptive-Behavior-Disorders-diagnosis;*Electroencephalography-; *Epilepsy,-Temporal-Lobe-diagnosis<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:Attention-Deficit-and-Disruptive-Behavior-Disorders-physiopathology;Attention-Deficit-and-Disruptive-Behavior-Disorders-psychology; Brain-Mapping;Child-; Diagnosis,-Differential; Epilepsy,-Temporal-Lobe-physiopathology;Epilepsy,-Temporal-Lobe-psychology; Family-Relations; Sick-Role;Violence-psychology<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  diagnosis; physiopathology; psychology<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  99001899<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 15 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  Hypothalamic hamartomas and gelastic epilepsy: a spectroscopic study.<p>AUTHOR:  Tasch,-E; Cendes,-F; Li,-L-M; Dubeau,-F; Montes,-J; Rosenblatt,-B;Andermann,-F; Arnold,-D<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, McGillUniversity, Montreal Neurological Hospital and Institute, Quebec, Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Neurology. 1998 Oct; 51(4): 1046-50<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0028-3878<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND: Patients with hypothalamic hamartomas present withepileptic attacks of laughter and later experience multiple seizure types andcognitive decline, suggestive of secondary generalized epilepsy. It has beensuggested in the past that gelastic seizures originate in the temporal lobesrather than in the hamartoma, but temporal resections have been ineffective.Recent electrophysiologic evidence suggests that the epileptogenic dischargesmay originate in the hamartoma itself. METHODS: We used proton magneticresonance spectroscopic imaging to quantify the amount of neuronal damage inthe temporal lobes and hamartomas of patients with hypothalamic hamartomas andgelastic seizures. Five patients were studied and the relative intensity ofN-acetylaspartate to creatine (NAA/Cr) was determined for both temporal lobesas well as for the hamartoma. These values were compared with signals from thetemporal lobes and hypothalami of normal control subjects. RESULTS: NAA/Cr wasnot significantly different from normal control subjects for either temporallobe, nor was there a significant asymmetry between the two temporal lobes forany of the patients. NAA resonance signals were present in the hamartomas, andthe ratio of NAA to Cr was decreased in the hamartomas compared with thehypothalami of normal control subjects (t = 4.5, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Wefound no detectable neuronal damage in the temporal lobes of patients withhypothalamic hamartomas and gelastic epilepsy. This is further evidence thatgelastic seizures do not originate in the temporal lobes of these patients.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Epilepsy-radionuclide-imaging;*Hamartoma-radionuclide-imaging; *Hypothalamic-Diseases-radionuclide-imaging;*Laughter-physiology<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Adult-; Child-; Electroencephalography-;Epilepsy-etiology; Epilepsy-physiopathology; Hamartoma-complications;Hamartoma-physiopathology; Hypothalamic-Diseases-complications;Hypothalamic-Diseases-physiopathology; Hypothalamus-;Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging-methods;Tomography,-Emission-Computed,-Single-Photon<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  etiology; physiopathology; radionuclide-imaging; complications;physiology; methods<p>SUBSET:  Abridged-Index-Medicus; Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98452787<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 16 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  Complex visual hallucinations.

The content of these hallucinations is striking andrelatively stereotyped, often involving animals and human figures in brightcolours and dramatic settings. Conditions causing these hallucinations includenarcolepsy-cataplexy syndrome, peduncular hallucinosis, treated idiopathicParkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia without treatment, migraine coma,Charles Bonnet syndrome (visual hallucinations of the blind), schizophrenia,hallucinogen-induced states and epilepsy. We describe cases of hallucinosis dueto several of these causes and expand on previous hypotheses to suggest threemechanisms underlying complex visual hallucinations. (i) Epileptichallucinations are probably due to a direct irritative process acting oncortical centres integrating complex visual information. (ii) Visual pathwaylesions cause defective visual input and may result in hallucinations fromdefective visual processing or an abnormal cortical release phenomenon. (iii)Brainstem lesions appear to affect ascending cholinergic and serotonergicpathways, and may also be implicated in Parkinson's disease. These brainstemabnormalities are often associated with disturbances of sleep. We discuss howthese lesions, outside the primary visual system, may cause defectivemodulation of thalamocortical relationships leading to a release phenomenon. Wesuggest that perturbation of a distributed matrix may explain the production ofsimilar, complex mental phenomena by relatively blunt insults at disparatesites.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Hallucinations-physiopathology;*Visual-Pathways-physiopathology<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Brain-Diseases-physiopathology;Hallucinations-chemically-induced; Schizophrenia-physiopathology;Sleep,-REM-physiology; Vision-Disorders-physiopathology<p>CHECKTAGS:  Human<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article; Review; Review,-Tutorial<p>SUBHEADINGS:  physiopathology; chemically-induced; physiology<p>SUBSET:  Abridged-Index-Medicus; Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  99013084<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 17 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part A<p><p>TITLE:  Spectroscopic imaging of frontal neuronal dysfunction inhyperekplexia.<p>AUTHOR:  Bernasconi,-A; Cendes,-F; Shoubridge,-E-A; Andermann,-E; Li,-L-M;Arnold,-D-L; Andermann,-F<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, McGill Universityand Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital, Quebec, Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Brain. 1998 Aug; 121 ( Pt 8)1507-12<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0006-8950<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  ENGLAND<p>ABSTRACT:  We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) toassess in vivo cortical neuronal involvement in hyperekplexia. Cerebralneuronal function was measured using proton MRSI in four unrelated patientswith hyperekplexia and 20 healthy controls. All patients had the major form ofhyperekplexia, with additional atypical clinical features in two of them.Family history was positive in three patients and absent in one. The neuronalmarker N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline-containing compounds (Cho) and creatine(Cr) were measured in frontal, central and parietal areas. The MRSI showed areduction of the relative resonance intensity of NAA/(Cr + Cho) in frontal andcentral regions in three patients, and in the right frontal region of thefourth. In one patient a second MRSI showed normal relative NAA resonanceintensities over both temporal lobes as well as in the brainstem. In twosubjects the topography of EEG abnormalities in the frontal lobes coincidedwith the MRSI findings. This proton MRSI study indicates the presence offrontal neuronal dysfunction in hyperekplexia. Whether this represents corticaldysfunction or an epiphenomenon of diencephalic or brainstem abnormalitiesremains open. However, the observation of normal proton MRSI in the temporalregions and brainstem in one of the patients seems to concur with thehypothesis of a facilitatory role of cortical dysfunction within areas ofsensorimotor representation in the generation of the pathological startlereaction in hyperekplexia.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Frontal-Lobe-physiopathology;*Muscle-Rigidity-physiopathology; *Nervous-System-Diseases-diagnosis;*Nervous-System-Diseases-physiopathology; *Neurons-physiology;*Reflex,-Abnormal-physiology; *Startle-Reaction-physiology<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Adult-;Aspartic-Acid-analogs-and-derivatives; Aspartic-Acid-metabolism;Brain-metabolism; Choline-metabolism; Creatine-metabolism;Frontal-Lobe-pathology; Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging;Nervous-System-Diseases-pathology; Reference-Values<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  analogs-and-derivatives; metabolism; pathology; physiopathology;diagnosis; physiology<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  56-84-8; 57-00-1; 62-49-7; 997-55-7<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  Aspartic-Acid; Creatine; Choline; N-acetylaspartate<p>SUBSET:  Abridged-Index-Medicus; Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98375830<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 18 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part A<p><p>TITLE:  Human doublecortin (DCX) and the homologous gene in mouse encode aputative Ca2+-dependent signaling protein which is mutated in human X-linkedneuronal migration defects.<p>AUTHOR:  Sossey-Alaoui,-K; Hartung,-A-J; Guerrini,-R; Manchester,-D-K;Posar,-A; Puche-Mira,-A; Andermann,-E; Dobyns,-W-B; Srivastava,-A-K<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  J.

A single LIS/SBH locus on Xq22.3-q24 was mapped by linkage analysisand physical mapping of the breakpoint in an X;2 translocation. A recentlyidentified gene, doublecortin ( DCX ), is expressed in fetal brain and mutatedin LIS/SBH patients. We have identified four novel missense mutations in thegene, one familial mutation with LIS in a male and SBH in the carrier females,one de novo mutation in an SBH female, and two mutations in sporadic SBH femalepatients. The DCX gene is found to be expressed exclusively at a very highlevel in the adult frontal lobe. We have also cloned the X-linked mousedoublecortin (Dcx) gene. It encodes isoforms of a highly hydrophilic 40 kDaprotein, homologous to its human counterpart and containing several potentialphosphorylation sites. Both human and mouse DCX proteins are homologous to aCNS protein containing a Ca2+/calmodulin kinase domain, suggesting that the DCXprotein may belong to a novel class of intracellular proteins involved inneuronal migration through Ca2+-dependent signaling.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Cell-Movement-genetics; *Epilepsy-genetics;*Mental-Retardation-genetics; *Neurons-pathology; *Neuropeptides-genetics;*X-Chromosome<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adult-; Amino-Acid-Sequence; Calcium-metabolism;Epilepsy-metabolism; Epilepsy-pathology; Linkage-Genetics;Mental-Retardation-metabolism; Mental-Retardation-pathology; Mice-;Molecular-Sequence-Data; Sequence-Homology,-Amino-Acid;Signal-Transduction-genetics<p>CHECKTAGS:  Animal; Female; Human; Male; Support,-U.S.-Gov't,-P.H.S.<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  metabolism; genetics; pathology<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  0; 0; 7440-70-2<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  Neuropeptides; doublecortin-protein; Calcium<p>SECONDARY SOURCE IDENTIFIER:  GENBANK/AF040254; GENBANK/AF040255;GENBANK/AF045547<p>CONTRACT OR GRANT NUMBERS:  R01NS35515NSNINDS<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98334553<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 19 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part A<p><p>TITLE:  Treatment of absence status in the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome withpropofol.<p>AUTHOR:  Crouteau,-D; Shevell,-M; Rosenblatt,-B; Dilenge,-M-E; Andermann,-F<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Division of Neurology, Montreal Neurological Hospital,Quebec, Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Neurology. 1998 Jul; 51(1): 315-6<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0028-3878<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Epilepsy,-Absence-drug-therapy;*Propofol-administration-and-dosage;*Sedatives,-Nonbarbiturate-administration-and-dosage;*Status-Epilepticus-drug-therapy<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Child-; Electroencephalography-;Epilepsy,-Absence-diagnosis; Fetal-Growth-Retardation-complications;Mental-Retardation-complications; Status-Epilepticus-diagnosis<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  diagnosis; drug-therapy; complications;administration-and-dosage<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  0; 2078-54-8<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  Sedatives,-Nonbarbiturate; Propofol<p>SUBSET:  Abridged-Index-Medicus; Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98337591<p><p>Record 20 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part A<p><p>TITLE:  Continuous unilateral epileptiform discharge and language delay: effectof functional hemispherectomy on language acquisition.<p>AUTHOR:  Rosenblatt,-B; Vernet,-O; Montes,-J-L; Andermann,-F; Schwartz,-S;Taylor,-L-B; Villemure,-J-G; Farmer,-J-P<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Division of Neurology, the Montreal Children's Hospital,Quebec, Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Epilepsia. 1998 Jul; 39(7): 787-92<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0013-9580<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy of functional hemispherectomy inpromoting language acquisition in a child with severe language delay andcontinuous left hemispheric epileptiform discharge in the absence of clinicalseizures. We report a 6-month-old girl who initially presented with a righthemiparesis secondary to a lesion of probable prenatal origin in thedistribution of the left middle cerebral artery. Weeks later, she developedinfantile spasms. At 1.5 years of age, because of intractable seizures, thepatient had fenestration of the left porencephalic cyst and anterior temporallobectomy. The seizures ceased; however, language development remained limitedto 35 words at 3.5 years of age. The EEG showed almost continuous epileptiformactivity over the left hemisphere with no independent epileptiform potentialscontralaterally. She underwent a functional left hemispherectomy. METHODS:Imaging, electroencephalographic investigation, pre- and postoperativepsychological and speech assessment were carried out. RESULTS: Considerablelanguage, speech, and behavior improvement was noted within 2 months ofsurgery. CONCLUSIONS: Interictal epileptiform discharges can interfere with thedevelopment of contralateral hemispheric function in the absence of clinicalseizures. Early functional hemispherectomy may have a role in promoting optimallanguage development in appropriately selected patients.

Seizures are usually followed by postictal headacheand are often associated with interictal occipital rhythmic paroxysmal EEGactivity that appears only after eye closure. In some children the ictal visualsymptoms or the interictal EEG abnormalities may not be demonstrated. Theclinical and/or EEG manifestations of other forms of idiopathic partial orgeneralized epilepsy may be found in association. Occipital spikes innon-epileptic children with defective vision, occipital slow spike-and-wavefound in some patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, focal epilepsy due tooccipital lesions, seizures originating in the temporal lobe secondary to anoccipital abnormality, and complicated or basilar migraine must be consideredin the differential diagnosis. Early-onset benign occipital epilepsy or seizuresusceptibility syndrome deserves to be considered separately. It has beendefined by Panayiotopoulos as consisting of brief, infrequent attacks orprolonged status epilepticus and characterized by ictal deviation of the eyesand/or head and vomiting, occurring in children usually between the ages of 3and 7 years. Advances in molecular genetics will help decide whether these twodisorders are indeed distinct. Benign occipital and benign rolandic epilepsyare commonly associated with migraine. The selective involvement of theoccipital lobe in migraine has not been fully explained. The associationbetween benign occipital epilepsy and migraine is likely related to thisunderlying mechanism as well. The "fixation off" phenomenon or blocking ofoccipital epileptic discharges by eye opening is not specific to benignoccipital epilepsy of childhood and may be found in symptomatic epilepsies aswell. Migraine and epilepsy are distinct disorders, both as far as theirpathophysiologic mechanisms and clinical symptomatology are concerned. There ishowever an overlap in some patients and a causal relationship may exist insome, leading to clinically distinct migraine epilepsy syndromes. Here too,clarification of the molecular basis of migraine and of epilepsy will throwlight on the nature of the relationship between the two conditions.<p>COMMENTS:  Comment In: Epilepsia. 1999 Sep;40(9):1320-3<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Epilepsy-diagnosis; *Migraine-diagnosis;*Occipital-Lobe-physiopathology<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Adult-; Age-Factors; Child-;Electroencephalography-; Epilepsy-physiopathology; Migraine-physiopathology;Prognosis-; Syndrome-<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article; Review; Review,-Tutorial<p>SUBHEADINGS:  diagnosis; physiopathology<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98299702<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 23 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part A<p><p>TITLE:  Familial alternating epilepsia partialis continua with chronicencephalitis: another variant of Rasmussen syndrome?<p>AUTHOR:  Silver,-K; Andermann,-F; Meagher-Villemure,-K<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Neurology, Montreal Children's Hospital,McGill University, Quebec, Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Arch-Neurol. 1998 May; 55(5): 733-6<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0003-9942<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  Two brothers had infantile epilepsia partialis continua alternatelyinvolving both sides of the body. The children rapidly developed severepsychomotor regression and cerebral atrophy. A brain biopsy specimen showedevidence of chronic inflammatory changes. Extensive investigation did notprovide evidence of a specific viral pathogenesis, mitochondrial disorder, orany identifiable neurodegenerative genetically determined disorder. Thisillness has the features of Rasmussen chronic encephalitis, in which bilateralinvolvement is quite unusual. Although few patients with bilateral hemispheralinvolvement have been described, to our knowledge there have been no reportedcases involving affected siblings. The familial disorder described herein mayrepresent yet another variant of the classically sporadic and unilateralchildhood form. This group of disorders is probably immunologicallydetermined.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Encephalitis-genetics;*Epilepsia-Partialis-Continua-genetics<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Child,-Preschool; Chronic-Disease;Diagnosis,-Differential; Encephalitis-diagnosis; Infant-; Syndrome-<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  diagnosis; genetics<p>SUBSET:  Abridged-Index-Medicus; Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98266770<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 24 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part A<p><p>TITLE:  Celiac disease, bilateral occipital calcifications and intractableepilepsy: mechanisms of seizure origin.<p>AUTHOR:  Bernasconi,-A; Bernasconi,-N; Andermann,-F; Dubeau,-F; Guberman,-A;Gobbi,-G; Olivier,-A<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, MontrealNeurological Hospital and Institute, McGill University, Quebec, Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Epilepsia. 1998 Mar; 39(3): 300-6<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0013-9580<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  PURPOSE: To elucidate the mechanisms of seizure origin in patientswith celiac disease and bilateral occipital calcifications (CEBOC). Individualswith CEBOC frequently present with occipital lobe seizures, but additionallesions and additional attack patterns may occur. METHODS: We studied two menand one woman who had CEBOC. Villous atrophy was revealed in the two patientswho underwent duodenal biopsy. All had a comprehensive presurgical evaluation,including prolonged video-EEG recordings. Two had magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) with volumetric study of mesial temporal structures (MRIV). One patienthad undergone stereotactic intracranial depth electrode studies (SEEG).RESULTS: All patients presented with intractable complex partial seizures. Twohad partial simple seizures with visual aura. Neurologic examination wasnormal; one was of normal intelligence, and two were mildly retarded.Neuroimaging studies showed that each had bilateral occipital calcifications aswell as epileptiform abnormalities over temporal lobes. In one, MRI showed anadditional right frontal lesion, but SEEG demonstrated right occipital lobeseizure origin with anterior spread; this male patient later underwent a rightoccipital lobe resection. Another with a history of prolonged febrileconvulsions had bilateral hippocampal and amygdalar atrophy demonstrated byMRIV. CONCLUSIONS: In one patient, SEEG confirmed that seizures originated inthe occipital lobe. The presence of dual pathology was demonstrated in another,raising the possibility of both occipital and temporal seizure onset. Thepresence of extraoccipital lesions or of mesial temporal atrophy requires SEEGfor clarification of seizure onset. In the absence of confounding factors andwhen laterality can be demonstrated, surgical treatment may be considered.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Calcinosis-epidemiology;*Celiac-Disease-epidemiology; *Electroencephalography-methods;*Epilepsy,-Complex-Partial-diagnosis; *Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging;*Occipital-Lobe-pathology<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adult-; Calcinosis-diagnosis; Calcinosis-pathology;Comorbidity-; Electrodes,-Implanted; Epilepsy,-Complex-Partial-epidemiology;Epilepsy,-Complex-Partial-etiology; Middle-Age; Monitoring,-Physiologic<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  diagnosis; epidemiology; pathology; methods; etiology<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98237159<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 25 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part A<p><p>TITLE:  Catastrophic deterioration and hippocampal atrophy after childhoodstatus epilepticus.<p>AUTHOR:  Gross,-D-W; Li,-L-M; Andermann,-F<p>SOURCE:  Ann-Neurol. 1998 May; 43(5): 687<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0364-5134<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>COMMENTS:  Comment On: Ann Neurol. 1997 Jul;42(1):11-7<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Cognition-Disorders-pathology;*Hippocampus-pathology; *Status-Epilepticus-pathology<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Atrophy-; Child-; Infant-<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Comment; Letter<p>SUBHEADINGS:  pathology<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98244770<p><p>Record 26 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part A<p><p>TITLE:  Excellent surgical results obtained in patients with a depressedfrontal fracture leading to frontal encephalomalacia and intractable frontalseizures.<p>AUTHOR:  Andermann,-F; Cukiert,-A; Olivier,-A<p>SOURCE:  Epilepsia. 1998 Jan; 39(1): 108<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0013-9580<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>COMMENTS:  Comment On: Epilepsia. 1997 Jun;38(6):670-7<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Brain-Diseases-etiology; *Brain-Diseases-surgery;*Epilepsy,-Frontal-Lobe-etiology; *Epilepsy,-Frontal-Lobe-surgery;*Epilepsy,-Post-Traumatic-etiology; *Epilepsy,-Post-Traumatic-surgery;*Frontal-Bone-injuries; *Frontal-Lobe-surgery; *Skull-Fractures-complications<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Encephalomalacia-complications;Encephalomalacia-etiology; Encephalomalacia-surgery; Frontal-Lobe-injuries;Treatment-Outcome<p>CHECKTAGS:  Human<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Comment; Letter<p>SUBHEADINGS:  etiology; surgery; complications; injuries<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98237131<p><p>Record 27 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part A<p><p>TITLE:  Late-onset temporal lobe epilepsy and dilatation of the hippocampalsulcus by an enlarged Virchow-Robin space.<p>AUTHOR:  Bastos,-A-C; Andermann,-F; Melancon,-D; Cendes,-F; Guberman,-A;Dubeau,-F; Olivier,-A<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Neurology, Montreal Neurological Instituteand Hospital, McGill University, Quebec, Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Neurology. 1998 Mar; 50(3): 784-7<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0028-3878<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  MRI signal changes within the hippocampal sulcus have beenattributed to a dilated Virchow-Robin space within that sulcus, but no clinicalcorrelates have previously been described.

The etiology is unknown, and the pathological abnormalities varyfrom those of active disease, with numerous microglial nodules, with or withoutneuronophagia, perivascular round cells and glial scarring, to those of remotedisease, demonstrated by neuronal loss, gliosis and perivascular round cellsbut few microglial nodules. We describe five patients presenting with clinicalfeatures typical of Rasmussen's syndrome, in whom pathological examinationshowed a second, previously unsuspected pathology in addition to the changes ofchronic encephalitis. Two of the patients had vascular abnormalities bearingsome resemblance to cavernous angiomata, one had a tumor, one had tuberoussclerosis, and one the forme fruste of tuberous sclerosis. The coexistence of asecond pathology in these patients may provide information about the underlyingmechanism of this rare condition.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Encephalitis-complications;*Epilepsy,-Generalized-complications<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Brain-Neoplasms-complications; Child-;Child,-Preschool; Chronic-Disease; Encephalitis-etiology;Epilepsy,-Generalized-etiology; Hemangioma,-Cavernous-complications; Infant-;Syndrome-; Tuberous-Sclerosis-complications<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  complications; etiology<p>SUBSET:  Abridged-Index-Medicus; Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98180561<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 29 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part A<p><p>TITLE:  Mutations in the palmitoyl-protein thioesterase gene (PPT; CLN1)causing juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis with granular osmiophilicdeposits.<p>AUTHOR:  Mitchison,-H-M; Hofmann,-S-L; Becerra,-C-H; Munroe,-P-B; Lake,-B-D;Crow,-Y-J; Stephenson,-J-B; Williams,-R-E; Hofman,-I-L; Taschner,-P-E;Martin,-J-J; Philippart,-M; Andermann,-E; Andermann,-F; Mole,-S-E;Gardiner,-R-M; O'Rawe,-A-M<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Paediatrics, University College LondonMedical School, The Rayne Institute, 5 University Street, London WC1E 6JJ, UK.hmitchis@ucl.ac.uk<p>SOURCE:  Hum-Mol-Genet. 1998 Feb; 7(2): 291-7<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0964-6906<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  ENGLAND<p>ABSTRACT:  A subtype of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) is well recognizedwhich has a clinical course consistent with juvenile NCL (JNCL) but theultrastructural characteristics of infantile NCL (INCL): granular osmiophilicdeposits (GROD). Evidence supporting linkage of this phenotype, designatedvJNCL/GROD, to the INCL region of chromosome 1p32 was demonstrated (pairwiselod score with D1S211 , Z max = 2.63, straight theta = 0.00). The INCL gene,palmitoyl-protein thioesterase (PPT ; CLN1), was therefore screened formutations in 11 vJNCL/GROD families. Five mutations in the PPT gene wereidentified: three missense mutations, Thr75Pro, Asp79Gly, Leu219Gln, and twononsense mutations, Leu10STOP and Arg151STOP. The missense mutation Thr75Proaccounted for nine of the 22 disease chromosomes analysed and the nonsensemutation Arg151STOP for seven. Nine out of 11 patients were shown to combine amissense mutation on one disease chromosome with a nonsense mutation on theother. Mutations previously identified in INCL were not observed in vJNCL/GRODfamilies. Thioesterase activity in peripheral blood lymphoblast cells was foundto be markedly reduced in vJNCL/GROD patients compared with controls. Theseresults demonstrate that this subtype of JNCL is allelic to INCL and furtheremphasize the correlation which exists between genetic basis andultrastructural changes in the NCLs.<p>COMMENTS:  Erratum In: Hum Mol Genet 1998 Apr;7(4):765<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Neuronal-Ceroid-Lipofuscinosis-genetics;*Neurons-ultrastructure; *Point-Mutation; *Thiolester-Hydrolases-genetics<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Age-of-Onset; Alleles-; Child-;Cytoplasmic-Granules-ultrastructure; DNA-Mutational-Analysis;Europe-epidemiology; Exons-genetics; Genetic-Heterogeneity; Genotype-;Lymphocytes-enzymology; Neuronal-Ceroid-Lipofuscinosis-classification;Neuronal-Ceroid-Lipofuscinosis-epidemiology;Neuronal-Ceroid-Lipofuscinosis-pathology; North-America-epidemiology;Polymerase-Chain-Reaction; RNA,-Messenger-genetics; Sequence-Analysis,-DNA;Thiolester-Hydrolases-deficiency<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't;Support,-U.S.-Gov't,-P.H.S.<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  ultrastructure; epidemiology; genetics; enzymology;classification; pathology; deficiency<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  0; EC 3.1.2.; EC 3.1.2.-<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  RNA,-Messenger; Thiolester-Hydrolases;palmitoyl-protein-thioesterase<p>CONTRACT OR GRANT NUMBERS:  NS36867NSNINDS<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98087582<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 30 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part A<p><p>TITLE:  Epilepsy induced by thinking and spatial tasks.<p>AUTHOR:  Andermann,-F; Zifkin,-B-G; Andermann,-E<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, McGillUniversity, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Adv-Neurol. 1998; 75263-72<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0091-3952<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Epilepsy-psychology; *Space-Perception-physiology;*Thinking-physiology<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Adult-; Child-; Electroencephalography-;Epilepsy-epidemiology; Epilepsy-genetics; Epilepsy-physiopathology<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article; Review; Review,-Tutorial<p>SUBHEADINGS:  epidemiology; genetics; physiopathology; psychology; physiology<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98046536<p><p>Record 31 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1998 Part A<p><p>TITLE:  Seizures induced by eating.<p>AUTHOR:  Remillard,-G-M; Zifkin,-B-G; Andermann,-F<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Departement des Sciences Neurologiques, Hopital duSacre-Coeur, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Adv-Neurol. 1998; 75227-40<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0091-3952<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1998<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Eating-physiology; *Seizures-physiopathology<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adult-; Aged-; Middle-Age<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article; Review; Review,-Tutorial<p>SUBHEADINGS:  physiology; physiopathology<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98046534<p><p>Record 32 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  Normalization of neuronal metabolic dysfunction after surgery fortemporal lobe epilepsy.

ProtonMR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) can image and quantify neuronal damage inpatients with TLE based on reduced signals from N-acetylaspartate (NAA), acompound localized exclusively in neurons. We performed proton MRSI in patientswith TLE before and after surgical treatment to determine whether NAA or otherresonance intensities changed in the temporal lobes of patients with TLE aftersurgery, and whether these changes correlated with surgical outcome.N-acetylaspartate resonance intensity relative to creatine (NAA/Cr) wasabnormally low preoperatively in at least one temporal lobe in all 14 patientsexamined. It was low ipsilaterally in the patients who became seizure free andbilaterally in those who did not. Postoperatively, it increased to the normalrange on the side of surgery in all patients who became seizure free. In theone patient who became seizure free and who had low NAA/Cr in both temporallobes before surgery, NAA/Cr values in the contralateral, unoperated temporallobe also increased to the normal range. In contrast, NAA relative intensityratios did not change in those patients who continued to have seizures aftersurgery. The creatine resonance intensity (Cr) in the temporal lobes was high,relative to the brainstem, in seven patients preoperatively. After surgery, theCr remained high in two patients, both of whom continued to have seizures. Weconclude that NAA (and Cr) abnormalities in TLE do not result solely fromneuronal loss and gliosis but can be reversible after postsurgical control ofseizures. This implies that the NAA and Cr abnormalities in patients with TLE,at least in part, are dynamic markers of both local and remote physiologicdysfunction associated with ongoing seizures.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Epilepsy,-Temporal-Lobe-metabolism;*Epilepsy,-Temporal-Lobe-surgery; *Neurons-metabolism<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Adult-;Aspartic-Acid-analogs-and-derivatives; Aspartic-Acid-metabolism;Choline-metabolism; Creatine-metabolism; Electroencephalography-;Epilepsy,-Temporal-Lobe-diagnosis; Epilepsy,-Temporal-Lobe-pathology;Magnetic-Resonance-Spectroscopy; Middle-Age; Postoperative-Period; Protons-;Reference-Values; Treatment-Outcome<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  analogs-and-derivatives; metabolism; diagnosis; pathology;surgery<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  0; 56-84-8; 57-00-1; 62-49-7; 997-55-7<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  Protons; Aspartic-Acid; Creatine; Choline;N-acetylaspartate<p>SUBSET:  Abridged-Index-Medicus; Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98073805<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 33 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  Progressive myoclonus epilepsy in young adults with neuropathologicfeatures of Alzheimer's disease.<p>AUTHOR:  Melanson,-M; Nalbantoglu,-J; Berkovic,-S; Melmed,-C; Andermann,-E;Roberts,-L-J; Carpenter,-S; Snipes,-G-J; Andermann,-F<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, McGill Universityand Montreal Neurological Institute, Quebec, Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Neurology. 1997 Dec; 49(6): 1732-3<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0028-3878<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  Progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME) may develop in adult life.

It is often assumed that disturbed behaviour will preventadequate preoperative evaluation or that the patients are unable to provideinformed consent for preoperative investigations and for surgery. Theobservation that the psychosis usually does not improve after operation andfears of an exacerbation of psychosis with post-surgical seizure remission,analogous to 'forced normalization', are further deterrents to surgery in thesepatients. We describe five patients with the dual diagnoses of medicallyintractable temporal lobe epilepsy and chronic psychosis who underwent temporallobe resection. The patients were able to provide informed consent and wereeasily managed during preoperative investigation. Seizure outcome has beenexcellent in all. Neither temporal lobe resection nor remission of seizuresinfluenced the nature or evolution of the psychosis. Subjectively the patientsfunctioned better in activities of daily living and freedom from seizuresimproved integration into psychiatric treatment facilities. With appropriatepsychiatric intervention, patients with chronic psychosis and refractoryepilepsy can participate in presurgical investigation successfully, and canundergo surgery uneventfully.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Epilepsy,-Temporal-Lobe-psychology;*Epilepsy,-Temporal-Lobe-surgery; *Psychotic-Disorders-complications<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adult-; Amygdala-physiopathology;Antipsychotic-Agents-therapeutic-use; Chronic-Disease;Hippocampus-physiopathology; Patient-Compliance;Psychotic-Disorders-drug-therapy; Psychotic-Disorders-rehabilitation;Temporal-Lobe-physiopathology; Temporal-Lobe-surgery; Treatment-Outcome<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  physiopathology; therapeutic-use; psychology; surgery;complications; drug-therapy; rehabilitation<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  0<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  Antipsychotic-Agents<p>SUBSET:  Abridged-Index-Medicus; Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98059146<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 35 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  Learning and retention of words and designs following excision frommedial or lateral temporal-lobe structures.<p>AUTHOR:  Jones-Gotman,-M; Zatorre,-R-J; Olivier,-A; Andermann,-F; Cendes,-F;Staunton,-H; McMackin,-D; Siegel,-A-M; Wieser,-H-G<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Montreal Neurological Institute, Quebec, Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Neuropsychologia. 1997 Jul; 35(7): 963-73<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0028-3932<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  ENGLAND<p>ABSTRACT:  We sought to elucidate the contributions of the amygdala,hippocampus and temporal neocortex to learning and memory for verbal andvisuospatial material. Two matched learning tasks, using abstract words versusabstract designs, were administered to patients with unilateral neocorticectomy(NCE; Dublin), selective amygdalohippocampectomy (AHE; Zurich) or anteriortemporal-lobe resection invading the amygdala and hippocampus (ATL; Montreal).Data were analysed according to side and type of resection. Learning and recallfor words was impaired in groups with resection from the left temporal lobe,irrespective of whether mediobasal structures were spared or temporal neocortexwas spared. All right-resection groups were unimpaired. Learning for abstractdesigns was impaired across all trials in the right AHE and NCE groups, and onthe last two trials in the right ATL group. Restricted deficits of lowermagnitude were observed on some trials in left-resection groups. These resultsshow a partial dissociation between side of excision and type of material, butthe finding of similar deficits in all resection types was unexpected. Wepropose that excision from either the hippocampal region or temporal neocortexmay result in a disconnection, giving a similar functional outcome, as bothtypes of resection interrupt a circuit likely to be essential for normalstorage and retrieval of information.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Epilepsy,-Temporal-Lobe-surgery;*Pattern-Recognition,-Visual-physiology;*Postoperative-Complications-physiopathology; *Psychosurgery-;*Retention-Psychology-physiology; *Temporal-Lobe-surgery;*Verbal-Learning-physiology<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Amygdala-physiopathology; Amygdala-surgery;Attention-physiology; Brain-Mapping; Epilepsy,-Temporal-Lobe-physiopathology;Hippocampus-physiopathology; Hippocampus-surgery;Long-Term-Potentiation-physiology; Nerve-Net-physiopathology;Nerve-Net-surgery; Temporal-Lobe-physiopathology<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  physiopathology; surgery; physiology<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  97370295<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 36 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  Sindrome de Andermann.

It isassociated with mental retardation and various dysmorphic changes.Deterioration is usually progressive with loss of motor skills, development ofscoliosis during adolescence, tendency to behaviour disorders and death duringthe third decade (approximately). CLINICAL CASE: We present a 13 year old girldiagnosed as having the spastic tetraparesic type of PCI, who was sent to us sothat we could reconsider the diagnosis in view of the atypical course of theillness. The patient had an unusual phenotype with dysmorphic changes (mainlyfacial), axial hypotonia with flexion-retraction of the hands, generalizedarreflexia, neurogenic bladder, skin changes with ulcers on the legs and mentalretardation. Neurophysiological studies showed a predominantly motorpolyneuropathy. There were signs of axonal neuropathy on both sural nerve andskeletal muscle biopsies. The clinical features, phenotype, microcephaly withagenesis of the corpus callosum and a posterior fossa cyst, associated withspinal atrophy indicated the diagnosis of Andermann's syndrome. CONCLUSIONS:This case is of interest in view of the exceptional rarity of Andermann'ssyndrome in our population.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Brain-Diseases-pathology;*Corpus-Callosum-abnormalities<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Age-of-Onset; Bladder,-Neurogenic;Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging; Muscle-Hypotonia; Paresis-; Psychomotor-Disorders;Syndrome-<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Female; Human<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  pathology; abnormalities<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  97383848<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 37 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging and magnetic resonanceimaging volumetry in the lateralization of temporal lobe epilepsy: a series of100 patients.<p>AUTHOR:  Cendes,-F; Caramanos,-Z; Andermann,-F; Dubeau,-F; Arnold,-D-L<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Quebec,Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Ann-Neurol. 1997 Nov; 42(5): 737-46<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0364-5134<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  Surgery is a safe and effective treatment for drug-resistanttemporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). However, bilateral electroencephalographic (EEG)abnormalities are frequently present, making presurgical lateralizationdifficult. New magnetic resonance (MR) techniques can help; proton magneticresonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) can detect and quantify focal neuronaldamage or dysfunction based on reduced signals from the neuronal markerN-acetylaspartate, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based measurements ofamygdala-hippocampal volumes (MRIVol) can improve the detection of atrophy ofthese structures. We performed proton MRSI and MRIVol in 100 consecutivepatients with medically intractable TLE to determine how well these techniquesagreed with the lateralization by extensive EEG investigation. We found thatthe EEG, MRSI, and MRIVol findings were highly concordant. The MRSI wasabnormal in 99 of 100 patients (bilateral in 54%). The MRIVol was abnormal in86 of 98 patients (bilateral in 28%). We obtained lateralization in 83% ofpatients using MRIVol alone, in 86% using MRSI alone, and in 90% by combiningMRSI and MRIVol (vs 93% lateralization by EEG). MRSI was abnormal in 12patients with normal MRIVol. The combination of proton MRSI and MRIVol canlateralize TLE accurately and noninvasively in the great majority of patients.By reducing reliance on EEG, these imaging techniques could reduce prolongedpresurgical evaluation and make seizure surgery available to more patients.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Epilepsy,-Temporal-Lobe-diagnosis; *Laterality-;*Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging-methods;*Magnetic-Resonance-Spectroscopy-diagnostic-use<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adult-; Aspartic-Acid-analogs-and-derivatives;Aspartic-Acid-analysis; Creatinine-analysis; Electroencephalography-;Epilepsy,-Temporal-Lobe-surgery; Middle-Age; Protons-; Temporal-Lobe-chemistry;Temporal-Lobe-physiopathology; Treatment-Outcome<p>CHECKTAGS:  Comparative-Study; Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  analogs-and-derivatives; analysis; diagnosis; surgery; methods;diagnostic-use; chemistry; physiopathology<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  0; 56-84-8; 60-27-5; 997-55-7<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  Protons; Aspartic-Acid; Creatinine; N-acetylaspartate<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98052466<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 38 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging for discrimination ofabsence and complex partial seizures.<p>AUTHOR:  Cendes,-F; Stanley,-J-A; Dubeau,-F; Andermann,-F; Arnold,-D-L<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, McGillUniversity, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Ann-Neurol. 1997 Jan; 41(1): 74-81<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0364-5134<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  We performed proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging of thetemporal lobes between, during, and soon after nonconvulsive seizures in 20patients with documented temporal lobe epilepsy, 5 patients with primarygeneralized epilepsy, and 2 patients with secondary generalized epilepsy. Ourobjective was to determine whether there were metabolic changes observable bymagnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging during seizures and whether thesechanges were specific for focal or generalized nonconvulsive seizures. We founda significant increase in lactate to creatine plus phosphocreatine(lactate/creatine) values, reflecting an imbalance in energy supply and demandor an adaptation in response to ictal neuronal discharges, during and soonafter complex partial seizures, but not during or soon after absence seizuresassociated with generalized epilepsy. In patients with temporal lobe epilepsy,the N-acetylaspartate resonance relative to creatine plus phosphocreatine waslow in one or both temporal lobes, indicating neuronal loss or damage. This wasnot observed in patients with primary generalized epilepsy. The regions withabnormal lactate/creatine and N-acetylaspartate/creatine values corresponded tothe epileptogenic focus as defined by clinical-electroencephalographicinvestigation. There was no change in the N-acetylaspartate/creatine values inthe temporal lobes between the interictal, ictal, or postictal states. Weconclude that (1) partial seizures are associated with abnormally high lactatelevels, but absence seizures are not, and (2) no short-term changes ofN-acetylaspartate occur during or soon after complex partial seizures orabsence seizures. These findings may be related to the lack of postictalconfusion in patients with absence seizures, as well as with the more benigncourse of primary generalized epilepsy with nonconvulsive attacks.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Epilepsy,-Absence-metabolism;*Epilepsy,-Complex-Partial-metabolism<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Adult-;Epilepsy,-Temporal-Lobe-metabolism; Magnetic-Resonance-Spectroscopy;Middle-Age; Protons-; Temporal-Lobe-metabolism<p>CHECKTAGS:  Human; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  metabolism<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  0<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  Protons<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  97158508<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 39 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  The Friedreich ataxia GAA triplet repeat: premutation and normalalleles.<p>AUTHOR:  Montermini,-L; Andermann,-E; Labuda,-M; Richter,-A; Pandolfo,-M;Cavalcanti,-F; Pianese,-L; Iodice,-L; Farina,-G; Monticelli,-A; Turano,-M;Filla,-A; De-Michele,-G; Cocozza,-S<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Centre de Recherche Louis-Charles Simard, Montreal, Quebec,Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Hum-Mol-Genet. 1997 Aug; 6(8): 1261-6<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0964-6906<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  ENGLAND<p>ABSTRACT:  The most common mutation causing Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), anautosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease, is the hyperexpansion of apolymorphic GAA triplet repeat localized within an Alu sequence (GAA-Alu) inthe first intron of the frataxin (X25) gene. GAA-Alu belongs to the AluSxsubfamily and contains several polymorphisms in strong linkage disequilibriumeither with a subgroup of normal alleles, or with hyperexpanded FRDA-associatedalleles. GAA repeat sizes in 300 normal chromosomes (97 from carriers and 203from controls) were distributed in two separate groups: 83% of them containedbetween six and 10 triplets (small normal alleles), while the remaining 17% hadmore than 12 triplets, up to 36 (large normal alleles). Sequence analysisshowed that no normal, stable allele contained more than 27 uninterrupted GAAtriplets. All longer normal alleles were interrupted by a hexanucleotide repeat(GAGGAA). An allele containing an uninterrupted run of 34 GAA triplets wasstably transmitted in four instances, but in one case underwent hyperexpansionto 650 triplets. Overall, our results suggest that the FRDA-associated expandedGAA repeats originate from normal alleles by recurrent expansions of alleles atrisk.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Alleles-; *Friedreich-Ataxia-genetics;*Trinucleotide-Repeats<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Base-Sequence; DNA-; Molecular-Sequence-Data;Mutation-; Phosphotransferases-Alcohol-Group-Acceptor-genetics;Polymorphism-Genetics<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Human; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't;Support,-U.S.-Gov't,-P.H.S.<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  genetics<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  9007-49-2; EC 2.7.1; EC 2.7.1.-<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  DNA; Phosphotransferases-(Alcohol-Group-Acceptor);frataxin<p>CONTRACT OR GRANT NUMBERS:  NS34192NSNINDS<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  97402207<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 40 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  Phenotypic variability in Friedreich ataxia: role of the associated GAAtriplet repeat expansion.<p>AUTHOR:  Montermini,-L; Richter,-A; Morgan,-K; Justice,-C-M; Julien,-D;Castellotti,-B; Mercier,-J; Poirier,-J; Capozzoli,-F; Bouchard,-J-P;Lemieux,-B; Mathieu,-J; Vanasse,-M; Seni,-M-H; Graham,-G; Andermann,-F;Andermann,-E; Melancon,-S-B; Keats,-B-J; Di-Donato,-S; Pandolfo,-M<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Centre de Recherche Louis-Charles Simard, Montreal, Quebec,Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Ann-Neurol. 1997 May; 41(5): 675-82<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0364-5134<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  We studied genotype-phenotype correlations in a group of 100patients with typical Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), and in three groups of patientswith atypical clinical presentations, including 44 Acadian FRDA, 8 late-onsetFRDA (LOFA), and 6 FRDA with retained reflexes (FARR). All patients, except 3with typical FRDA, carried two copies of the FRDA-associated GAA triplet repeatexpansion. Overall, the phenotypic spectrum of FRDA appeared to be wider thandefined by the currently used diagnostic criteria. Our study indicated theexistence of several sources of variability in FRDA. Patients with larger GAAexpansions tended to have earlier onset and were more likely to show additionalmanifestations of the disease. Mitotic instability of the expanded GAA repeatsmay partially account for the limited degree of correlation between expansionsizes as determined in lymphocytes and clinical parameters. Some clinicalvariants associated with specific FRDA haplotypes, such as Acadian FRDA andFARR, turned out to be unrelated to expansion sizes. No polymorphism in thefrataxin coding sequence could be associated with these clinical variants.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Friedreich-Ataxia-classification;*Friedreich-Ataxia-genetics; *Trinucleotide-Repeats<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Adult-; Age-of-Onset; Child-;DNA-analysis; Disease-Progression; Friedreich-Ataxia-epidemiology; Genotype-;Phenotype-<p>CHECKTAGS:  Human; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't; Support,-U.S.-Gov't,-P.H.S.<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  analysis; classification; epidemiology; genetics<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  9007-49-2<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  DNA<p>CONTRACT OR GRANT NUMBERS:  NS34192NSNINDS<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  97297899<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 41 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  Periventricular nodular heterotopia and intractable temporal lobeepilepsy: poor outcome after temporal lobe resection.<p>AUTHOR:  Li,-L-M; Dubeau,-F; Andermann,-F; Fish,-D-R; Watson,-C; Cascino,-G-D;Berkovic,-S-F; Moran,-N; Duncan,-J-S; Olivier,-A; Leblanc,-R; Harkness,-W<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, MontrealNeurological Institute and Hospital, Quebec, Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Ann-Neurol. 1997 May; 41(5): 662-8<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0364-5134<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  We describe 5 women and 5 men with periventricular nodularheterotopia and electroclinical features suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy,who were surgically treated for control of medically refractory seizures.Magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral periventricular nodularheterotopia in 7 of the 10 patients. Because of the lack of clear localization,6 patients were studied with intracranial depth electrode recordings. Seizureswere of hippocampal onset (3 patients), regional temporal lobe onset (2patients), or occipital-temporal onset (1 patient). Anterior temporal lobectomywas performed in 6 patients; selective amygdalohippocampectomy, in 1; andanterior temporal lobectomy plus resection of the heterotopic tissue, in 3.None of the 9 patients followed for more than 12 months postoperatively wereseizure free. Two patients were initially seizure free for approximately 18months, but then seizures recurred. One patient had a major reduction inseizure frequency at a 39-month follow-up after most of the unilateralheterotopic tissue was included in the temporal resection. Temporal resectiondid not lead to a long-term favorable outcome in this group of patients withperiventricular nodular heterotopia and epileptogenic discharges involving thetemporal lobe. This suggests a more widespread disorder with epileptogenicactivity possibly originating in or near the heterotopic tissue. The clinicaland electrographic features of periventricular nodular heterotopia pointing totemporal lobe origin are misleading and temporal resection does not result inlong-term cessation of seizures.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Brain-Diseases-surgery; *Choristoma-surgery;*Epilepsy,-Temporal-Lobe-surgery; *Temporal-Lobe<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adult-; Amygdala-surgery; Brain-Diseases-pathology;Choristoma-pathology; Follow-Up-Studies; Gliosis-; Hippocampus-pathology;Hippocampus-surgery; Treatment-Outcome<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  surgery; pathology<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  97297897<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 42 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part B<p><p>TITLE:  Familial progressive sensorimotor neuropathy with agenesis of thecorpus callosum (Andermann syndrome): a clinical, neuroradiological andhistopathological study.<p>AUTHOR:  Deleu,-D; Bamanikar,-S-A; Muirhead,-D; Louon,-A<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Neurology, SultanQaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Sultanate of Oman.<p>SOURCE:  Eur-Neurol. 1997; 37(2): 104-9<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0014-3022<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  SWITZERLAND<p>ABSTRACT:  Three siblings from consanguineous parents, originating fromTanzania, presented with symptoms of complete or partial agenesis of the corpuscallosum.

Recently, twomutations in the cystatin B gene (also known as stefin B, STFB) mapping to21q22.3 have been implicated in the EPM1 phenotype: a G--&gt;C substitution inthe last nucleotide of intron 1 that was predicted to cause a splicing defectin one family, and a C--&gt;T substitution that would change an Arg codon (CGA)to a stop codon (TGA) at amino acid position 68, resulting in a truncatedcystatin B protein in two other families. A fourth family showed undetectableamounts of STFB mRNA by northern blot analysis in an affected individual. Wepresent haplotype and mutational analyses of our collection of 20 unrelatedEPM1 patients and families from different ethnic groups. We identify fourdifferent mutations, the most common of which consists of an unstableapproximately 600-900 bp insertion which is resistant to PCR amplification.This insertion maps to a 12-bp polymorphic tandem repeat located in the 5'flanking region of the STFB gene, in the region of the promoter. The size ofthe insertion varies between different EPM1 chromosomes sharing a commonhaplotype and a common origin, suggesting some level of meiotic instabilityover the course of many generations. This dynamic mutation, which appearsdistinct from conventional trinucleotide repeat expansions, may arise via anovel mechanism related to the instability of tandemly repeated sequences.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Cystatins-genetics; *DNA-Transposable-Elements;*Epilepsies,-Myoclonic-genetics; *Mutation-<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Base-Sequence; Chromosomes,-Human,-Pair-21;Cysteine-Proteinase-Inhibitors-genetics; DNA-Primers; Haplotypes-;Molecular-Sequence-Data; Pedigree-; Polymerase-Chain-Reaction;Polymorphism-Genetics; Regulatory-Sequences,-Nucleic-Acid;Repetitive-Sequences,-Nucleic-Acid<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  genetics<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  0; 0; 0; 0; 88844-95-5<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  Cystatins; Cysteine-Proteinase-Inhibitors; DNA-Primers;DNA-Transposable-Elements; stefin<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  97207653<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 44 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part A<p><p>TITLE:  Surgical treatment of patients with single and dual pathology:relevance of lesion and of hippocampal atrophy to seizure outcome.<p>AUTHOR:  Li,-L-M; Cendes,-F; Watson,-C; Andermann,-F; Fish,-D-R; Dubeau,-F;Free,-S; Olivier,-A; Harkness,-W; Thomas,-D-G; Duncan,-J-S; Sander,-J-W;Shorvon,-S-D; Cook,-M-J; Arnold,-D-L<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, MontrealNeurological Institute and Hospital, McGill University, Quebec, Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Neurology. 1997 Feb; 48(2): 437-44<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0028-3878<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  Modern neuroimaging can disclose epileptogenic lesions in manypatients with partial epilepsy and, at times, display the coexistence ofhippocampal atrophy in addition to an extrahippocampal lesion (dual pathology).We studied the postoperative seizure outcome of 64 patients with lesionalepilepsy (median follow-up, 30 months) and considered separately the surgicalresults in the 51 patients with a single lesion and in the 13 who had dualpathology. In patients with a single lesion, 85% were seizure free orsignificantly improved (Engel's class I-II) when the lesion was totally removedcompared with only 40% when there was incomplete resection (p &lt; 0.007). Allthree patients with dual pathology who had both the lesion and the atrophichippocampus removed became seizure free. In contrast, only 2 of the 10 patientswith dual pathology undergoing surgery aimed at the lesion or at thehippocampus alone became seizure free (p &lt; 0.05), although 4 of them showedsignificant improvement (Engel's class II). We conclude that the outcome inpatients with single epileptogenic lesions is usually dependent upon thecompleteness of lesion resection. In patients with dual pathology, surgeryshould, if possible, include resection of both the lesion and the atrophichippocampus.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Epilepsies,-Partial-pathology;*Epilepsies,-Partial-surgery; *Hippocampus-pathology<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Adult-; Aged-; Atrophy-; Child-;Middle-Age; Treatment-Outcome<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  pathology; surgery<p>SUBSET:  Abridged-Index-Medicus; Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  97193143<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 45 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part A<p><p>TITLE:  Contribution of medial versus lateral temporal-lobe structures to humanodour identification.<p>AUTHOR:  Jones-Gotman,-M; Zatorre,-R-J; Cendes,-F; Olivier,-A; Andermann,-F;McMackin,-D; Staunton,-H; Siegel,-A-M; Wieser,-H-G<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Brain. 1997 Oct; 120 ( Pt 10)1845-56<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0006-8950<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  ENGLAND<p>ABSTRACT:  To investigate possible distinct contributions of differenttemporal-lobe structures to odour identification, the University ofPennsylvania Smell Identification Test was administered monorhinally toseizure-free patients who had undergone one of three types of temporal-loberesection practised in three different institutions for surgical treatment ofepilepsy. The resections were neocorticectomy (Dublin), selectiveamygdalohippocampectomy (Zurich), or anterior temporal-lobe resection withencroachment on amygdala and hippocampus (Montreal). Resections, analysed fromMRI scans, showed unexpected encroachment on medial structures in most patientsof the neocorticectomy groups, and largest amygdala and hippocampal resectionsin the amygdalohippocampectomy groups. Impaired odour identification wasobserved in all patient groups, irrespective of surgical approach, withgreatest impairment in the nostril ipsilateral to the resection. The finding ofdeficits in all three surgical groups suggests that damage in the anteriortemporal area, perhaps in piriform cortex, is sufficient to disrupt performanceon this task; it may be that function is disrupted in the medial temporal-loberegion by disconnection when the periamygdaloid area is damaged, even whenamygdala and hippocampus are left intact. An alternative explanation for ourresults is that damage in any one of these areas disrupts a complex networkinvolving several distinct temporal-lobe structures.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Smell-physiology; *Temporal-Lobe-physiology<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Adult-; Epilepsy-surgery;Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging; Middle-Age; Postoperative-Period; Reference-Values;Temporal-Lobe-pathology; Temporal-Lobe-surgery<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  surgery; physiology; pathology<p>SUBSET:  Abridged-Index-Medicus; Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  98032078<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 46 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part A<p><p>TITLE:  Genetic linkage analysis of a variant of juvenile onset neuronal ceroidlipofuscinosis with granular osmiophilic deposits.<p>AUTHOR:  O'Rawe,-A; Mitchison,-H-M; Williams,-R; Wheeler,-R; Andermann,-E;Andermann,-F; Hart,-Y-M; Martin,-J-J; Philippart,-M; Stephenson,-J-B;Gardiner,-R-M; Mole,-S-E<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Paediatrics, University College LondonMedical School, Rayne Institute, United Kingdom.<p>SOURCE:  Neuropediatrics. 1997 Feb; 28(1): 21-2<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0174-304X<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  GERMANY<p>ABSTRACT:  A number of variant forms of the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses(NCL) have been described and remain unmapped. The genes for infantile (CLN1),juvenile (CLN3) and Finnish-variant late-infantile (CLN5) have previously beenmapped to chromosome regions 1p32, 16p12 and 13q21.1-32 respectively. The locusfor a variant form of juvenile onset NCL characterised by cytosomal granularosmiophilic deposits (GROD) has been excluded from the CLN3 region ofchromosome 16. This study describes the outcome of genetic linkage analysis infour families with this variant at the loci for the CLN1 and CLN5 genes. Usinghighly informative microsatellite markers tightly linked to the CLN5 locus wehave excluded the JNCL variant with GROD from this region. Marker typing acrossthe CLN1 region suggests that JNCL with GROD may be an allelic variant ofinfantile NCL.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Chromosome-Mapping; *Cytoplasmic-Granules-genetics;*Linkage-Genetics-genetics; *Neuronal-Ceroid-Lipofuscinosis-genetics;*Variation-Genetics<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Child-; Child,-Preschool;Chromosomes,-Human,-Pair-1; Chromosomes,-Human,-Pair-13;Chromosomes,-Human,-Pair-16; Cyclins-genetics; Cytoplasmic-Granules-pathology;Europe-; Fungal-Proteins-genetics; Genetic-Markers-genetics; Infant-;Neuronal-Ceroid-Lipofuscinosis-diagnosis;Neuronal-Ceroid-Lipofuscinosis-pathology; Pedigree-; United-States<p>CHECKTAGS:  Human; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't; Support,-U.S.-Gov't,-Non-P.H.S.;Support,-U.S.-Gov't,-P.H.S.<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  genetics; pathology; diagnosis<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  0; 0; 0; 0<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  CLN3-protein; Cyclins; Fungal-Proteins; Genetic-Markers<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  97295724<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 47 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part A<p><p>TITLE:  Linkage and physical mapping of X-linked lissencephaly/SBH (XLIS): agene causing neuronal migration defects in human brain.<p>AUTHOR:  Ross,-M-E; Allen,-K-M; Srivastava,-A-K; Featherstone,-T; Gleeson,-J-G;Hirsch,-B; Harding,-B-N; Andermann,-E; Abdullah,-R; Berg,-M;Czapansky-Bielman,-D; Flanders,-D-J; Guerrini,-R; Motte,-J; Mira,-A-P;Scheffer,-I; Berkovic,-S; Scaravilli,-F; King,-R-A; Ledbetter,-D-H;Schlessinger,-D; Dobyns,-W-B; Walsh,-C-A<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Neurology, UMHC, Minneapolis, MN 55455,USA.<p>SOURCE:  Hum-Mol-Genet. 1997 Apr; 6(4): 555-62<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0964-6906<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  ENGLAND<p>ABSTRACT:  While disorders of neuronal migration are associated with as much as25% of recurrent childhood seizures, few of the genes required to establishneuronal position in cerebral cortex are known. Subcortical band heterotopia(SBH) and lissencephaly (LIS), two distinct neuronal migration disordersproducing epilepsy and variable cognitive impairment, can be inherited alone ortogether in a single pedigree. Here we report a new genetic locus, XLIS, mappedby linkage analysis of five families and physical mapping of a balanced X;2translocation in a girl with LIS. Linkage places the critical region inXq21-q24, containing the breakpoint that maps to Xq22.3-q23 by high-resolutionchromosome analysis. Markers used for somatic cell hybrid and fluorescence insitu hybridization analyses place the XLIS region within a 1 cM interval. Thesedata suggest that SBH and X-linked lissencephaly are caused by mutation of asingle gene, XLIS, that the milder SBH phenotype in females results from randomX-inactivation (Lyonization), and that cloning of genes from the breakpointregion on X will yield XLIS.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Cerebral-Cortex-abnormalities; *Linkage-Genetics;*Sex-Chromosome-Abnormalities-genetics; *X-Chromosome-genetics<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Cerebral-Cortex-pathology; Chromosome-Mapping;Chromosomes,-Human,-Pair-2-genetics; Dosage-Compensation-Genetics;Epilepsy-etiology; Epilepsy-genetics; Hybrid-Cells;In-Situ-Hybridization,-Fluorescence; Karyotyping-; Pedigree-; Phenotype-;Restriction-Mapping; Translocation-Genetics<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't;Support,-U.S.-Gov't,-P.H.S.<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  abnormalities; pathology; genetics; etiology<p>CONTRACT OR GRANT NUMBERS:  NS32457NSNINDS; NS35515NSNINDS<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  97252389<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 48 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part A<p><p>TITLE:  Band heterotopia or double cortex in a male: bridging structuressuggest abnormality of the radial glial guide system.<p>AUTHOR:  Ono,-J; Mano,-T; Andermann,-E; Harada,-K; Sakurai,-K; Ikeda,-T;Yoshihara,-N; Shimizu,-K; Okada,-S; Andermann,-F<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Division of Pediatrics, Toyomaka Municipal Hospital, Osaka,Japan.<p>SOURCE:  Neurology. 1997 Jun; 48(6): 1701-3<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0028-3878<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  A moderately retarded Japanese boy, with a normal male karyotype(46,XY), was diagnosed to have a subcortical band heterotopia or double cortexsyndrome. The band heterotopia was relatively thick compared with that of otherpatients reported. On T2-weighted coronal MR sections, there were numerousradial linear structures between the cortex and the band, probably representingthe trace of radial fibers. He had no family members with seizures or mentalretardation. Over 50 described patients with this malformation have been femaleexcept two patients briefly mentioned by several investigators. Bandheterotopia or the double cortex syndrome is inherited as a sex-linked dominantcondition. Affected mothers may have affected daughters or sons withlissencephaly, suggesting a link between these disorders.

This elucidation of the nature Jackson's pursuits throughouthis career draws upon primary sources of information-the elaborate writings ofJackson himself and of his Victorian mentors and confreres. The latterconstituted Jackson's thought collective, who contributed to a unique andpreviously undescribed document: Testimonials of Dr. J. Hughlings Jackson, M.D.(London, 1863). These medical men also contributed to the Medical Times andGazette and belonged to the London Pathological Society and the New SydenhamSociety. Jackson's thought collective and their shared beliefs and pursuitswere instrumental in shaping Jackson's career as reflected by his later works.Jackson's professional pursuits and extensive writings marked a lifetimededicated to developing a "Science of the Nervous System" according to aMillian-Spencerian form of deductive reasoning, to ultimately establish arational basis for the treatment of nervous disease. Jackson and hiscontemporaries initiated and developed a deductive ideology and methodologythat continue to be widely employed by neurologists today, and thus form thebasis of the current neurological paradigm.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Neurology-history<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Correspondence-history;History-of-Medicine,-19th-Cent.; History-of-Medicine,-20th-Cent.; London-;Writing-history<p>CHECKTAGS:  Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Biography; Historical-Article; Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  history<p>PERSONAL NAME AS SUBJECT:  Jackson,-J-H<p>SUBSET:  Abridged-Index-Medicus; Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  97193149<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 51 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part A<p><p>TITLE:  Chronic encephalitis and epilepsy in adults and adolescents: a variantof Rasmussen's syndrome?<p>AUTHOR:  Hart,-Y-M; Andermann,-F; Fish,-D-R; Dubeau,-F; Robitaille,-Y;Rasmussen,-T; Berkovic,-S; Marino,-R; Yakoubian,-E-M; Spillane,-K;Scaravilli,-F<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Montreal Neurologica Hospital and Institute, Quebec,Canada.<p>SOURCE:  Neurology. 1997 Feb; 48(2): 418-24<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0028-3878<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  Chronic encephalitis and epilepsy (Rasmussen's encephalitis) is arare progressive disorder of uncertain etiology that usually occurs inchildren, producing focal epilepsy, hemiparesis, and intellectualdeterioration. We identified 13 patients in whom seizures developed inadolescence or adulthood with a pathologic picture of chronic encephalitis. Theclinical characteristics were more variable than those occurring in children,with the patients falling into three groups: five patients developed seizuresin adulthood, but otherwise showed many resemblances to the childhood form;five developed seizures in adolescence, with similar presentation but rathermore benign course than in the younger patients; and three presented withclinical features initially suggestive of a tumor. Occipital onset to theseizures appeared to be more common than in the childhood form, and bilateraldisease also occurred.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Encephalitis-diagnosis; *Epilepsy-diagnosis<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Adult-; Chronic-Disease;Hemiplegia-diagnosis; Intelligence-; Mental-Disorders-diagnosis; Middle-Age;Syndrome-<p>CHECKTAGS:  Case-Report; Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  diagnosis<p>SUBSET:  Abridged-Index-Medicus; Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  97193140<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 52 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part A<p><p>TITLE:  Specificity of volumetric magnetic resonance imaging in detectinghippocampal sclerosis.<p>AUTHOR:  Watson,-C; Cendes,-F; Fuerst,-D; Dubeau,-F; Williamson,-B; Evans,-A;Andermann,-F<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Neurology, Wayne State University School ofMedicine, Detroit, Mich, USA.<p>SOURCE:  Arch-Neurol. 1997 Jan; 54(1): 67-73<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0003-9942<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based volumetricmeasurements of the hippocampal formation are useful in detecting unilateralhippocampal sclerosis (HS) in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. In thispathologic entity, volumetric MRI analysis shows the epileptogenic structure tobe atrophic when compared with the normal, nonepileptogenic side. Some authorshave suggested that the radiological features of atrophy of medial temporallobe structures are common in patients with complex partial seizures, but alsoare seen frequently in other seizure types and can occur even in patientswithout epilepsy. OBJECTIVE: To determine if seizures originating inextrahippocampal sites cause gliosis, cell loss, and atrophy of medial temporallobe structures (i.e., HS). METHODS: We studied 110 patients with chronicepilepsy using volumetric MRI measurements of the hippocampal formation.Seventeen patients had pathologically proven HS, 27 patients had seizures dueto extratemporal structural lesions, 15 patients had seizures caused byextrahippocampal temporal lobe lesions, 29 patients had primary generalizedepilepsy, and 22 patients had secondary generalized epilepsy. RESULTS: All 17patients with HS showed significantly reduced absolute hippocampal formationvolumes of greater than 2 SDs below the mean of the control groups. Thepreoperative hippocampal formation volume measurements correlated well with theseverity of HS on pathological examination. Hippocampal volumes were within thenormal range in all patients with primary generalized epilepsy, secondarygeneralized epilepsy, extratemporal structural lesions, and extrahippocampaltemporal lobe lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Seizures originating at extrahippocampalsites do not cause gliosis, cell loss, or atrophy of medial temporalstructures. Significant reduction in hippocampal volumes is a specific markerfor HS.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Epilepsy-pathology; *Gliosis-etiology;*Hippocampus-pathology; *Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Adult-; Aged-; Atrophy-; Child-;Epilepsy-complications; Gliosis-pathology; Middle-Age<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  complications; pathology; etiology<p>SUBSET:  Abridged-Index-Medicus; Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  97159075<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 53 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part A<p><p>TITLE:  Bilateral parasagittal parietooccipital polymicrogyria and epilepsy.<p>AUTHOR:  Guerrini,-R; Dubeau,-F; Dulac,-O; Barkovich,-A-J; Kuzniecky,-R;Fett,-C; Jones-Gotman,-M; Canapicchi,-R; Cross,-H; Fish,-D; Bonanni,-P;Jambaque,-I; Andermann,-F<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Institute of Child Neurology and Psychiatry, University ofPisa-IRCCS Stella Maris Foundation, Italy.<p>SOURCE:  Ann-Neurol. 1997 Jan; 41(1): 65-73<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0364-5134<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>ABSTRACT:  We describe 9 patients with a bilateral malformation of corticaldevelopment, centered around the parasagittal and mesial aspects of theparietooccipital cortex, with magnetic resonance imaging findings suggestive ofpolymicrogyria. No familial distribution or etiologic factors were identified.Location in a watershed area between anterior and posterior cerebral arteriessuggests postmigratory perfusion failure as the underlying cause. In mostpatients the malformation was detected by magnetic resonance imaging aftercomputed tomography scans with 10-mm-thick sections were considered normal.Seizures, present in all, had started between the ages of 20 months and 15years (mean, 9 years) and were intractable in 7. Complex partial seizures withor without minor automatisms were the most frequent ictal pattern. In only 4patients these were preceded by symptoms indicating posterior onset. Interictalelectroencephalograms showed both diffuse and bilateral parietooccipital ortemporal abnormalities. The range of IQ scores indicated average intelligenceto mild retardation. Several patients presented deficits on neuropsychologicaltasks requiring performance under time constraints, suggesting that themalformation may result in cognitive slowing. Early diagnosis of thismalformation may be difficult because of the lack of neurological signs,relatively late seizure onset, difficulty in localizing seizure onset, andinability to recognize the cortical abnormality on computed tomography scans.<p>COMMENTS:  Comment In: Ann Neurol. 1997 Aug;42(2):272-3<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Brain-abnormalities; *Epilepsy-pathology<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adolescence-; Child-; Electroencephalography-;Epilepsy-physiopathology; Infant-; Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging; Occipital-Lobe;Parietal-Lobe<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  abnormalities; pathology; physiopathology<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  97158507<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p><p>Record 54 of 54 in MEDLINE (R) 1997 Part A<p><p>TITLE:  Human epileptogenesis and hypothalamic hamartomas: new lessons from anexperiment of nature.<p>AUTHOR:  Berkovic,-S-F; Kuzniecky,-R-I; Andermann,-F<p>SOURCE:  Epilepsia. 1997 Jan; 38(1): 1-3<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0013-9580<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  1997<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  UNITED-STATES<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Epilepsy-etiology; *Hamartoma-complications;*Hypothalamic-Diseases-complications<p>CHECKTAGS:  Human<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Editorial; Review; Review,-Tutorial<p>SUBHEADINGS:  etiology; complications<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  97176640<p><hr><A HREF="home.html">go to Shufflebrain main menu</A><P><A HREF="http://www.indiana.edu/~pietsch/home.html#andermann">To Andermann menu</A><P><A href="mailto:pietsch@indiana.edu"><B>web contact:</B> pietsch@indiana.edu</A></body></html>
