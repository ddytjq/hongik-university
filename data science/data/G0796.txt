<h2> Welcome to the 75th Anniversary Astronomical Debate </h2> <p>

The Shapley - Curtis `Great Debate' of 1920 will never be forgotten.
Humanity will always want to know about the discovery of the true extent of
our Universe and our place within it.  History will always record how two
of the greatest astronomers of the first half of the 20th Century,
champions of opposing viewpoints, argued convincingly over the Scale of the
Universe. Curtis and Shapley used not only conjecture - their arguments
were also founded on new and detailed measurements from the largest and
most sophisticated telescopes of their time.  The 75th Anniversary
Astronomical Debate is a tribute to this pivotal moment in human
understanding. <p>

Today's debate, however, is more than a commemoration.   In attendance
today are some of the foremost astronomers of the later half of the 20th
century, including two champions of opposing viewpoints, poised to argue
over one of the greatest astronomical controversies of our  time.  Lamb and
Paczynski will use not only conjecture - their arguments are also founded
on new and detailed measurements from the largest and most sophisticated
telescopes of our time. This time the disagreement is over some of the most
powerful explosions ever discovered: Gamma Ray Bursts. <p>

How important is today's debate?  Our hope is to have the best discussion
to date of the differences between the paradigms that underlie this great
controversy. However, the importance of this event might turn out to be
even deeper: we might obtain here a better understanding of the nature of
scientific disagreement itself.  Although technology has changed, the
nature of scientific disagreement has not. <p>

I feel fortunate that this "crazy" idea of mine has come to have some
substance. I thank everyone in the program for taking me seriously, for
accepting my invitations, and for allowing me latitude in the planning.
The invaluable assistance of Jerry T. Bonnell, Jeffrey J. Goldstein and Jay
P. Norris cannot be measured.  I hope you find this event enjoyable and
educational. <p>
