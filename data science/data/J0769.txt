<h1>Restarts carry Andretti to Milwaukee Mile win</h1>

MILWAUKEE -- Michael Andretti and Al Unser Jr. resumed their long IndyCar rivalry Sunday with Andretti coming out the victor at the 200-lap Miller 200 at The Milwaukee Mile.<p>

Andretti was able to take advantage of the new IndyCar restart rules on the first of a pair of caution flags during the final 10 laps of the race.  IndyCar rules line the leaders up together rather than in running order with slower traffic separating the leaders.<p>

During the first restart, Andretti got the jump on Unser going into turn one and came out of turn two in with his Lola-Ford in the lead with six laps to go.  Unser's Penske-Mercedes faded, with Paul Tracy moving alongside to challenge, but falling back just as rookie Greg Moore spun and brought out another caution.<p>

The racers got back under way on the last lap and Andretti didn't give Unser a chance.  Tracy was third followed by Emerson Fittipaldi and Moore.  Points leader and four-race winner Jimmy Vasser finished 10th.<p>

&quot;I was a little bit surprised,&quot; Andretti said of the opportunity to pass Unser.  &quot;I was right on it.  The guys were great and we beat Little Al out of pits. The car was really good.&quot; <p>

&quot;Today, the yellow bit me,&quot; Unser said.  &quot;It helped for a great racing show.&quot; <p>

Unser said his car was using a harder compound tire than Andretti's, which would give him better performance during long runs. <p>

&quot;Those restarts are a lot of fun,&quot; remarked Tracy, who started on the pole. &quot;Overall, it was a great race.&quot; <p>

Andretti earned his 32nd career IndyCar victory and his fifth win at The Milwaukee Mile, both bests among active drivers. This was the fifth win in six races for Newman-Haas, which won with Tracy last year, Nigel Mansell in 1993 and Andretti in 1991, 1992 and Sunday.  Only Unser's victory for Team Penske in 1994 interrupted the string. <p>

Andretti came out strong, showing his fellow drivers no mercy and flying past Tracy after 37 laps to take his first lead of the day.  The race whittled down to Andretti and Unser trading places, but Unser racing up front more. <p>

The PPG Cup points standings will find Vasser with a 20-point lead over Unser, with Andretti and Tracy tied for third with 51 points each, 44 points behind Vasser. <p>

For the second week in a row, the racers didn't get a lap of racing in before the caution flag came out.  Parker Johnstone spun coming out of turn two just after the start of the race, bringing out the caution for four laps.  Last week, 13 cars wrecked before the start of the U.S. 500.<p>

The Miller 200 was the seventh round in the 16-race IndyCar series.  The next race is the Detroit Grand Prix on June 9.<p>
