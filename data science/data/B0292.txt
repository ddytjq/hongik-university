            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unpaid charges
            will normally only apply where we have been unable to pay a direct
            debit, standing order or cheque, because you do not have sufficient
            cleared funds in your account, at the time the direct debit or cheque
            is presented for payment or the standing order is due to be paid.
            <p>Current Account cheque payments and payments made from Investment
              and Current Accounts by direct debit, standing order and regular
              internal transfer, are normally processed before 9.00am. Please
              ensure that you have sufficient cleared money in your account by
              5.00pm on the day prior to the day the payment is due to be made.
              It is regretted that failure to ensure this is the case, may result
              in the payment not being made and a charge applied. Please allow
              additional time for processing of money paid in through our cash
              machines, agents or by post (see Cumberland Investment and Current
              Account Conditions for full details).
            <p>When an arranged regular internal transfer is due for payment,
              and the transfer date falls on a Sunday or English Bank Holiday,
              the transfer will be made on the next Society working day. In cases
              where a Sunday or English Bank Holiday falls on the last day of
              the month, transfers due on this date will be made on the Society
              working day prior to the last day of the month.
            <p>All charges for services are payable when the service is requested,
              or in the case of unpaid items, will be charged to your account
              when we return items unpaid.
            <p>The Cumberland also offers a limited Current Account service to
              non personal customers. Details of this service together with the
              additional charges which apply, can be obtained from any Cumberland
              branch.
            <p><B>We do not make any charge for cash withdrawals made at Cumberland
              Link cash machines or other Link cash machines.</B> Withdrawals
              made at some Link cash machines in non traditional places such as
              shops (as opposed to supermarkets), public houses and petrol stations
              may have a charge applied by the machine owner. The cash machine
              should however display a screen warning which will allow you to
              cancel the transaction and use an alternative machine, or continue
              with the withdrawal and accept the charge which will be deducted
              from your account along with the amount withdrawn.

            <br>
              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interest is charged
              on Current Account overdrafts for the period of time the account
              is overdrawn. The interest charged for each of the quarters ending
              30 June, 30 September, 31 December and 31 March will be deducted
              from Current Account customers’ account balances around the 25th
              day of the month following the dates shown. You will be pre-notified
              of this by a message on your statement or a separate interest advice.

              an overdraft with the Society the interest rate charged is 2.29%

              arranged an overdraft with the Society and your account goes overdrawn,
              then the rate of interest is 4.55% per quarter (equivalent to an
              <u>E.A.R. of 19.48%</u>). In addition to overdraft interest, a charge
              of £9 is payable for each payment we make on your behalf on an overdrawn
              Current Account where no formal overdraft has been agreed, or an
              agreed overdraft limit has been exceeded. Any charge payable will
              be deducted from your account when we make payment on your behalf.

            <br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We can arrange the purchase and sale of travellers cheques or
foreign currency through Travelex Ltd. Where appropriate,
the rate of exchange which will apply, will be the rate applicable
at the time your order is processed by Travelex Ltd.
Exchange rates may vary between the time of purchase and the
time of sale and cannot be guaranteed.
            <p>A handling fee of £5.00 is made by Travelex Ltd for each customer
              order, for the purchase of travellers cheques or foreign currency.
              In addition there is a commission charge of 1% of the sterling cost
              of the order. When we sell unused foreign currency or non sterling
              travellers cheques to Travelex Ltd on your behalf, no commission
              is charged. It normally takes four bank working days for the sterling
              equivalent to be credited to your account and be available for withdrawal.
              We reserve the right to limit the amount of foreign currency accepted
              for conversion into sterling.

              bank. We regret we cannot confirm in advance the amount of the charges,
              but for guidance this could be as high as £60. All charges will
              be deducted from the amount due on conversion and the net amount
              credited to your account. Please allow at least eight weeks for
              these cheques to be paid by the drawing banker. The rate of exchange
              which will apply will be the rate applicable on the date the cheque
              is paid by the drawing banker. We regret we cannot guarantee in
              advance the rate of exchange which will apply, nor will we normally

              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you wish to
              transfer money to a bank account abroad, we can arrange this through
              our bankers Royal Bank of Scotland plc. Transfers to a bank abroad
              can take approximately ten bank working days from the time we receive
              your written instructions to arrange the transfer to the date the
              money is received abroad, although transfers may take longer to
              be received and processed by some banks abroad. You can ask us to
              arrange the transfer of sterling or foreign currency, but we cannot
              guarantee in advance the rate of exchange which will apply, as this
              will depend on the date on which sterling is converted into foreign
              currency. Our bankers make a charge for transferring money abroad
              which is variable, but is currently £15. Transfers to a bank abroad
              may be subject to a charge made by the recipient bank, but we regret
              we cannot confirm in advance the amount of any such charge. We reserve
              the right not to accept requests to transfer funds to banks in countries
              where the transfer time may be considered by our bankers to be excessive.
              </font>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An alternative
              service is available, which takes approximately eight bank working
              days. The charge for this service is 0.30% of the amount being transferred
              subject to a minimum charge of &pound;17 and a maximum charge of
              &pound;40. If this service is used to transfer money in Euros, the
              charge will be a flat fee, currently &pound;20.</font>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you prefer
              to send money abroad yourself, we can arrange the purchase of a
              bankers draft through our bankers Royal Bank of Scotland plc. Our
              bankers make a charge which is variable, but is currently £15. We
              can arrange the purchase of a sterling or foreign currency bankers
              draft, but we cannot guarantee in advance the rate of exchange which
              will apply, as this will depend on the date on which the order for
