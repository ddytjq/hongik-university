<H3>PROGRAM OBJECTIVE</H3>


<HR>
                To use molecular biology to enhance our understanding of bioremediation and to
                genetically modify molecules and organisms to improve bioremedial activities. <p>
                <H3>BACKGROUND</H3>
                
                
<HR>
                <hr><h4><i>The potential of molecular manipulation to enhance bioremediation in
                the field remains untapped.</i></h4><hr>
                
                It is generally accepted that the great diversity of organisms living in soil and ground
                water have evolved the biochemical tools to detoxify many anthropogenic
                contaminants of concern to DOE.  The enzymatic pathway which degrades
                trichloroethylene (TCE) is one example.  At some contaminated sites, resident
                organisms lack critical enzymes for degradative processes or are inhibited by some
                component of the mixed contamination.  Selection techniques in genetics that modify
                organisms have been used to improve remedial affects on the environment, for
                example, bacterial-enhanced oil recovery.  No molecular manipulations have yet
                been applied to bioremediation in the field, and the real potential of this
                methodology remains untapped.<p>
                The use of genetically engineered organisms in the environment has been limited by
                public perception and the concerns of regulatory agencies about the potential risks
                of releasing genetically altered organisms into the environment.  In addition,
                engineered organisms' inability to compete with natural soil populations is an issue
                that must be addressed.  Accordingly, the technology associated with the regulation
                and containment of such organisms and the direct use of biomolecules extracted or
                removed from cell-free systems are critical areas for research.<p>
                <H3>APPROACH</H3>
                
                
<HR>
<hr><h4><i>Molecular biologists can isolate and characterize genes and gene
products that will enhance the bioremediation of mixed contaminants.</i></h4><hr>

Using the information and data gained from the program elements on Community
Dynamics and Biotransformation and Biodegradation, scientists will gain a better
understanding of the active, critical resident soil and subsurface populations. They
will identify the molecules, enzymes, and pathways most effective for
bioremediation of mixed contaminants and determine how techniques in molecular
and structural biology can improve the effectiveness of these organisms.  Molecular
biologists can isolate and characterize genes and gene products that will enhance the
bioremediation of mixed contaminants.  They will conduct structural studies of
bioremedial enzymes and other molecules to build a basis for
understanding and manipulating molecular activities for bioremediation
purposes. They will also develop expression systems for remedially
active molecules for pathway engineering, structure and function studies,
and large-scale, cell-free systems.  In addition, molecular biologists will
use rational design and random mutagenesis techniques to modify
activity and substrate binding specificity once the structural aspects of
molecules with remedial potential are identified and characterized.  All
of these efforts combined should lead to the application, testing, and
evaluation of improved bioremedial activity with respect to the stability,
efficacy, and safety of recombinant organisms and new or engineered
molecules in the field research center. <p>
Accordingly, the biomolecular engineering program will concentrate on
five areas:<p>
<menu>
1.              Analysis of genes and regulatory elements for critical molecules in
                bioremediation. <p>
2.              Structure and function of bioremedial molecules. <p>
3.              Genetic selection and engineering of improved bioremedial
                molecules and organisms. <p>
4.              Pathway engineering.  <p>
5.              Cell-free systems for bioremediation.<p>
