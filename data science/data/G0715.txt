            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edwin 
              Hubble was a man who changed our view of the Universe. In 1929 he 
              showed that galaxies are moving away from us with a speed proportional 
              to their distance. The explanation is simple, but revolutionary: 
              the Universe is expanding. </font>
            <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hubble 
              was born in Missouri in 1889. His family moved to Chicago in 1898, 
              where at High School he was a promising, though not exceptional, 
              pupil. He was more remarkable for his athletic ability, breaking 
              the Illinois State high jump record. At university too he was an 
              accomplished sportsman playing for the University of Chicago basketball 
              team. He won a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford where he studied law. 
              It was only some time after he returned to the US that he decided 
              his future lay in astronomy. </font>
            <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
              the early 1920's Hubble played a key role in establishing just what 
              galaxies are. It was known that some spiral nebulae (fuz<img src="hubble01.jpg" width="90" height="109" align="left" alt="Edwin Hubble">zy 
              clouds of light on the night sky) contained individual stars, but 
              there was no consensus as to whether these were relatively small 
              collections of stars within our own galaxy, the 'Milky Way' that 
              stretches right across the sky, or whether these could be separate 
              galaxies, or 'island universes', as big as our own galaxy but much 
              further away. In 1924 Hubble measured the distance to the Andromeda 
              nebula, a faint patch of light with about the same apparent diameter 
              as the moon, and showed it was about a hundred thousand times as 
              far away as the nearest stars. It had to be a separate galaxy, comparable 
              in size our own Milky Way but much further away. </font>
            <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hubble 
              was able to measure the distances to only a handful of other galaxies, 
              but he realised that as a rough guide he could take their apparent 
              brightness as an indication of their distance. The speed with which 
              a galaxy was moving toward or away from us was relatively easy to 
              measure due to the Doppler shift of their light. Just as a sound 
              of a racing car becomes lower as it speeds away from us, so the 
              light from a galaxy becomes redder. Though our ears can hear the 
              change of pitch of the racing car engine our eyes can't detect the 
              tiny red-shift of the light, but with a sensitive spectrograph Hubble 
              could determine the redshift of light from distant galaxies. </font>
            <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
              observational data available to Hubble by 1929 was sketchy, but 
              whether guided by inspired instinct or outrageous good fortune, 
              he correctly divined a straight line fit between the data points 
              showing the redshift was proportional to the distance. Since then 
              much improved data has shown the conclusion to be a sound one. Galaxies 
              are receding from us, and one another, as the Universe expands. 
              Within General Relativity, the theory of gravity proposed by Albert 
              Einstein in 1915, the inescapable conclusion was that all the galaxies, 
              and the whole Universe, had originated in a Big Bang, thousands 
              of millions of years in the past. And so the modern science of cosmology 
              was born. </font>
            <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hubble 
              made his great discoveries on the best telescope in the world at 
              that time - the 100-inch telescope on Mount Wilson in southern California. 
              Today his name carried by the best telescope we have, not on Earth, 
              but a satellite observatory orbiting our planet. The Hubble Space 
              Telescope is continuing the work begun by Hubble himself to map 
              our Universe, and producing the most remarkable images of distant 
              galaxies ever seen, many of which are available via the World Wide 
              Web.</font>
