face="Arial"><b><i>. The physiological consequenses of
tree-mounting.<br>
</i></b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The pre-birds were
essentially ground-living, but adopted the tree-mounting
behaviour in order to seek protection from predators or to bask
in the tree tops. The tree-mounting behaviour became, however, a
part of their breeding habit as they used to deposit</b> <b>their
eggs and hatchlings in the crowns of cycadoids.<br>
This behaviour was respondsible for the physiological
transformation of the cycadoids for breeding purpose caused the
evolution of endothermic homeothermy and the plumage. </b></font></p>

<p><a name="B91"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>1</b></font></a><font
face="Times New Roman"><b>. The purpose of tree-mounting.<br>
</b>The demonstrated transformation of the original reptilian
anatomy into an avian one did not, however, raise the reptilian
pre-birds to the higher evolutionary level of the avian class. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Such an evolutionary elevation
requires essential physiological changes, especially an increase
of the metabolic rate which, combined with means of regulation of
the internal temperature, might establish the endothermic
homeothermy, characteristic of birds.<br>
Besides, it is hard to think of a group of vertebrates, belonging
to the class of birds which does not posses the most
characteristic traits of birds: the feathers!</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The theory of the tree-mounting
bird-ancestors therefore should be justified, if it is consistent
with a hypothesis on the origin of endothermy and the origin of
feathers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It appears from the theropod-like
shape of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and from the general shape of
modern birds that the pre-birds retained the bipedal, longlegged
stance with the legs beneath the body. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This constituency of the body is
not particulary adequate in tree-climbing animals, but
appropriate in ground-living ones. That indicates that the
pre-birds in spite of an improved ability to mount trees never
became really arboreal, but maintained their ground-living life
style and only occasionally mounted and descended tree trunks.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The tree-mounting behaviour is
not likely to have served for food-searching in the cycadoid-tops
because this niche surely has been occupied by older, quadrupedal
reptiles with which the pre-birds had little possibility to
compede. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is more likely that the
pre-birds maintained and improved their bipedal stance by
searching for insects and other small prey on the ground. The
tree-mounting behaviour therefore might have been an additional
behaviour.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is most likely that the
additional climbing behaviour originally was performed by
ground-living pre-birds in order to escape from predators or to
bask in the sunny tree tops.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">If the radical anatomical changes
described were caused as an adaptation for an additional
tree-mounting behaviour of ground-living pre-birds, this
behaviour must have been maintained for millions of generations.
And consequently it must have served a highly beneficial purpose.
Of this a general breeding strategy is the most probable. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Most likely the reptilian,
bipedal, ground-living bird-ancestors originally laid their eggs
on the ground in heaps of decayed vegetables to be hatched by the
heat from fermentation, a breeding habit known in recent
reptiles. This breeding habit might the pre-birds have brought up
to the flat crowns of cycadoids in order to protect their eggs
and hatchlings from ground-living predators.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Such a small variation of the
breeding habit might have increased the number of their surviving
offspring in favour of those of their relatives, which were less
adapted for tree-mounting. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is, however, a possibility
that the habit of mounting trees was in the first place a
juvenile behaviour, as the youngs, which were hatched on the
ground, seeked refuge in the cycadoid tops. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In any case, the precocial
hatchlings (Elzanowski, 1985) should have been forced to descend
trees in order to feed themselves on the ground and to mount in
order to seek protection.</font></p>

<p><a name="B92"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>2</b></font></a><font
face="Times New Roman"><b>. Raise of body-temperature.<br>
</b>Even if residence in the flat crows of cycadoids might have
been advantageous for protective purpose, it gave the reptilian
pre-birds and their hatchlings little possibility to seek shade
unless they left their safe place and presented themselves as
easy preys of the ground-living predators.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">As exposure to sunheating for
longer periods is damaging to reptiles (Cowles &amp; Bogert,
1944) the evolution of any means to stay in the tree tops for as
long periods as possible therefore made the pre-birds more fit to
survive and to increase in number. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">A relatively simple precaution to
sustain the sunheating was to raise the temperature tolerance and
the optimal body-temperature as much as possible. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>This might explain the high
internal temperature of about 40 </i><sup><i>o</i></sup><i> - 42 </i><sup><i>o</i></sup><i>
C. of birds in general. </i></font></p>

<p><a name="B93"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>3</b></font></a><font
face="Times New Roman"><b>. Increase of metabolic rate.<br>
</b>An increased metabolism might have evolved subsequently as a
means to maintain this optimal internal temperature (Heinrich,
1977) when the pre-birds had to leave the tree-tops for
food-seeking in a shady undergrowth. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">An increase of the metabolic rate
also might have been evolutionarily enforced as an increase of
the activity level in general of the pre-birds.</font></p>

<p><a name="B94"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>4</b></font></a><font
face="Times New Roman"><b>. Respiratory system and air sacs.<br>
</b>In order to avoid overheating and thus a remedy of
maintaining the internal temperature at the optimal level the
peculiar air sac- and respiratory system of birds might have
evolved in the pre-birds as a means to obtain internal cooling by
ventilation (Gans, 1978). By means of such manner of cooling a
possibility of temperature regulation, necessary for homeothermy,
became possible.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>The high body-temperature, the
high metabolic rate and the homeothermy in birds might thus be
explained as an adaptation to an obligatory residence of the
pre-birds in the sun-exposed crowns of cycadoids or similar trees
for protection of broods. <br>

face="Arial"><b><i>. The Origin of Feathers.<br>
</i></b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The feather
originated from knobbed scales through stages of hollow
protuberances as a means to shade against damaging sun-radiation.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The benefit of residing in the
cycadoid tops for longer periods with little possibility to seek
shade might explain why the pre-birds evolved feathers as a
protection against damaging sun exposure (Regal, 1975; Gans,
1978). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is a tempting assumption that
feathers evolved from knobbed or plated scales through stages,
corresponding to the morphological development of feathers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Accordingly, the earliest
proto-feathers might have been protuberances which gave the
pre-birds some protection against sun-radiation. Gradually, the
protection increased as the protuberances evolved into quills
which at last evolved into feathers. See fig. 11.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The special benefit of this kind
of dermal protection - besides from its lightness and economy of
matherial - is that it shades against the sunrays without
retarding radiation from the skin . </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Further, this kind of dermal
protection did not prevent fast sunheating when the animal had
been cooled.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Depending on posture, the
proto-feathers cause a shady or sunny environment close to the
animal. This effect was refined by the evolution of the dermal
musculature which can deliberately erect or compress the
feathers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">As plumage must be carefully
tended to be effective as thermo-insulation, the pre-birds
simultaneously had to evolve the habit of plumage care.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>The origin of the feathers in
the pre-birds might thus also be explained as an adaptation to an
obligatory residence in the sun-exposed crowns of cycadoids.</i></font><i>
