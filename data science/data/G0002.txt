<p>
A new set of ephemerides for 15 of the largest asteroids, <b>USNO/AE98</b>, has
been produced for use in the <i>Astronomical Almanac</i>.  The ephemerides
cover the period from 1800 through 2150.  The internal uncertainty in the mean
longitude at epoch ranges from 0."05 for 7 Iris through 0."22 for 65 Cybele and
the uncertainty in the mean motion varies from 0."02 cen.<sup>-1</sup> for 4
Vesta to 0."14 cen.<sup>-1</sup> for 511 Davida.  This compares favorably with
the internal errors for the outer planets in DE200.  However, because the
asteroids have relatively little mass and are subject to perturbations by other
asteroids the actual uncertainties in their mean motions are likely to be a few
tenths of an arcsecond per century.
<p>
As part of improving the ephemerides, new masses and densities were determined
for 1 Ceres, 2 Pallas, and 4 Vesta, the three largest asteroids.  These masses
are: Ceres = (4.39 &#177 0.04) &#215 10<sup>-10</sup> M<sub>Sun</sub>, Pallas =
(1.59 &#177 0.05) &#215 10<sup>-10</sup> M<sub>Sun</sub>, Vesta =
(1.69 &#177 0.11) &#215 10<sup>-10</sup> M<sub>Sun</sub>.  The mass for Ceres
is smaller than most previous determinations of its mass.  This smaller mass is
a direct consequence of the increase in the mass determined for Pallas.  The
densities found are 2.05 &#177 0.05 gm. cm<sup>-3</sup> for Ceres, 4.2 &#177
0.3 gm cm<sup>-3</sup> for Pallas and 4.3 &#177 0.3 gm. cm<sup>-3</sup> for
Vesta.  The density for Ceres is somewhat greater than that found for the
taxonomically similar 253 Mathilde.
<p>
Comparison of the <b>USNO/AE98</b> ephemerides of Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and
Vesta with the <a href="#duncombe 1969"> Duncombe (1969)</a> shows some
differences that are directly attributable to the inclusion of asteroid
perturbations in the physical model.
<p>
This document is designed for the reader who wants to know the details of
the reduction of the data and determination of the ephemerides.  A paper
summarizing the process for the general reader is in preparation.

<a name="introduction"><center><h2> Introduction </h2></center></a>
<p>
The <i>Astronomical Almanac</i> has published ephemerides for 1 Ceres, 2
Pallas, 3 Juno, and 4 Vesta since its edition for 1953.  Historically, these
four asteroids have been observed more than any of the others.  Even in modern
times few asteroids have had more attention paid to them.  Ceres, Pallas, and
Vesta deserve such attention because they are the three most massive asteroids,
the source of significant perturbations of the planets, and are among the
brightest main belt asteroids making them prime targets for photometric and
spectroscopic studies aimed at understanding the composition of the asteroids.
They are also the largest asteroids in diameter, so they have been the subjects
of diameter determinations by groups such as
<a href="#millis et al 1987">Millis, et al. (1987)</a>,
<a href="#lambert 1985">Lambert (1985)</a>,
<a href="#magnuson 1986">Magnuson (1986)</a>,
<a href="#drummond & cocke 1988">Drummond & Cocke (1988)</a>, and
<a href="#thomas et al 1997">Thomas, et al. (1997)</a>.
<p>
The ephemerides currently published in the <i>Astronomical Almanac</i> are
based on the dated work of <a href="#duncombe 1969"> (Duncombe 1969)</a>.
These ephemerides extend only  until January 7, 2000.  As a result, the U.S.
Naval Observatory has produced a new set of ephemerides for use in the
<i>Astronomical Almanac</i>.
<p>
Interest in the asteroids has increased significantly over the past several
years for many reasons such as looking for clues to the origin and primordial
composition of the solar system, the dynamics of small solar system bodies, and
the potential of asteroid collisions with the Earth.  The asteroids are also a
source of significant perturbations of the major planets.  DE200, the JPL
planetary ephemerides currently used in the <i>Astronomical Almanac</i> was
constructed using perturbations from five asteroids
(<a href="#standish 1990">Standish 1990</a>) while more recent planetary
ephemerides such as DE403 include perturbations from 300 asteroids
(<a href="#standish et al 1995">Standish, et al. 1995</a>).  Thus, it was
decided to include more than the traditional four asteroids in the production
of asteroid ephemerides.  The criteria used to select a small sample of main
belt asteroids for producing ephemerides were:
<ol>
<li> Asteroids over 300 km in diameter, presumably the most massive asteroids.
These were chosen for future studies of their perturbations of the planets.
<li> Asteroids with excellent observing histories of discovered before 1850.
These were chosen to explore the accuracy limits to which current asteroid
ephemerides could be determined.
<li> Asteroids that were the largest in their taxonomic class.
</ol>
A total of 15 asteroids met these criteria and are given in table 1.

These 15 asteroids make up the <b>USNO/AE98</b> (<i>U.S. Naval Observatory
Asteroid Ephemerides of 1998</i>).  The <b>USNO/AE98</b> covers the period 1799
November 16 (JD 2378450.5) through 2100 February 1 (JD 2488100.5).
<p>
The construction of the ephemerides is discussed in the following sections.
<a href="#data"> Data </a> discusses the sources of the data used to determine
the ephemerides and how the data was handled.
<a href="#physical_model">Physical Model</a> discusses the physical model used
to integrate the ephemerides.  <a href="#asteroid_masses"> Asteroid Masses </a>

<a href="#ephemeris"> Ephemerides </a> discusses the resulting ephemerides.
And <a href="#residuals"> Residuals </a> looks at the residuals and places
limits on the accuracy of the ephemerides.

<a name="data"><center><h2> Data </h2></center></a>

<p>
An ephemeris is only as good as the data and the physical model that are used
to generate it.  The ephemerides of the asteroids are based on optical
positions, like the ephemerides of the outer solar system planets.  However,
there are also two <a href="#radar data">radar delay</a> observations of main
belt asteroids.  <a href="#bowell et al 1996">Bowell et al. (1996)</a> finds a
simple relation between the uncertainty in the osculating elements depending
primarily upon the length of time over which the the asteroid has been observed
and the number of oppositions at which observations have been made.  However,
for over sampled asteroids such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta the
uncertainty in the ephemerides can be further reduced based on the number and
quality of observations.  Thus an idea of the currently best available
ephemeris accuracy and accuracy reachable can be inferred from Table 2.

<p>
The optical observations used in creating these ephemerides came from two data
types: <a href="#wide angle data">wide angle</a> data (mainly from transit
instruments) and <a href="#relative data">relative data</a> (positions measured
relative to nearby background stars).  Each of these data types are handled
differently, so their sources and methods of reduction will be discussed
separately.
<p>
Some aspects of the data reduction was handled using the ephemeris program PEP
<a href="#ash 1965">(Ash 1965)</a>.  PEP is a high accuracy ephemeris generating
program capable of of generating ephemerides using complicated physical models,
comparing the results to many different observation types, adjusting designated
parameters and then producing a new set of ephemerides.  PEP can iterate the
ephemerides until a desired level convergence in the model parameters is
reached.  In addition to adjusting physical model parameters, PEP can adjust
such parameters as catalog corrections in right ascension and declination,
electronic delay biases in delay-Doppler observations, and corrections in the
location of observatories.  PEP can also be used to determine the
root-mean-square uncertainty in a set of observations for use in weighting
those observations.

<a name="wide angle data"><h3>WIDE ANGLE DATA</h3></a>

This data is usually taken with a transit instrument.  The measurements are not
made with respect to nearby stars, but are measured by means such as time of
transit or recorded using setting circles.  Usually the data is referred to an
equator and equinox determined from the measurements made by the instrument
itself, that is a fundamental catalog, but occasionally, as in the case of the
Carlsberg Meridian Circle,
<a href="#morrison et al 1990">(Morrison et al, 1990)</a> the observations are
differentially reduced to a preexisting equator and equinox.  The positions
for these observations are usually given as a geocentric apparent position with
respect to the equator and equinox of date.
<p>
Most asteroid observations from the nineteenth century are of the wide angle,
fundamental catalog variety.  The main sources of these observations are the
Royal Greenwich Observatory

Like the nineteenth century data, the Greenwich data prior to 1940 was reduced
on a yearly basis.  However, the data from the U.S. Naval Observatory, the Cape
Observatory, and the Royal Greenwich Observatory after 1940 were reduced to
fundamental catalogs that were the result of multi-year observing programs.
The Carlsberg meridian circle data was also reduced to apparent positions, but
on the system of the FK5 rather than as a fundamental catalog (
<a href="#morrison et al 1990">Morrison et al. 1990</a>).  The Universite de
Bordeaux data, taken from the Minor Planet Center, has been reduced to
topocentric astrometric positions on the mean equator and equinox of J2000.0.
<p>
Another potential source of wide-angle data was the Hipparcos astrometric
satellite.  Hipparcos asteroid observations were examined for inclusion in the
ephemerides.  However, the Hipparcos observations are one dimensional
observations made along a great circle at an arbitrary inclination with respect
to the celestial equator.  The span of the Hipparcos mission was only 3.3 years, so the usefulness of the observations is limited despite the high
one-dimensional accuracy of the observations.  For this reason the Hipparcos
observations were not used.

<h3><a name="relative data">RELATIVE DATA</a></h3>

Relative data is that data in which the astrometric position of the asteroid
is determined relative to other bodies, usually stars,  in the same field.
Over time the methods of taking relative data has changed radically.  Since
the positions of the background objects need to be known before the asteroid
position can be determined, the common practice is to use positions that are
all from a common epoch and corrected for proper motion of the background
objects.  Thus, the asteroid positions are given as topocentric positions of
epoch.  These observations were reduced to the dynamic coordinate system at a
variety of epochs using several different methods.  They also use the positions
of stars as published in a variety of catalogs with varying degrees of accuracy.
As a result, only the most recent relative position observations are of an
accuracy comparable to that of the wide angle, transit observations.
<p>
Data through the late nineteenth century was made using micrometers to compare
the asteroid with one or two field stars.  Essentially, the position  was
calculated at the telescope.
<p>
Beginning in the late nineteenth century photographic plates were used to
record the images of the asteroid and the background stars.  These plates were
later measured and a position calculated for the asteroid.  Photographic plates
have the added advantage of being able to collect light for extended periods of
time allowing objects too dim to be viewed directly to be recorded.  For this
reason photographic plates have been the dominant form of recording asteroid
positions through most of the twentieth century.  Initially, only three or so
stars were measured to determine the asteroid's position because the arithmetic
needed to produce a position could become quite arduous as more background
objects are used to determine the asteroid position.  As computers became more
commonplace, the arithmetic became less of a burden so more stars could be
measured and more sophisticated reduction models could be implemented.
</p>
<p>
Modern relative positions are most often made using CCDs. A CCD produces a
permanent record like photographic plates, and has the added advantage of
consisting of an array of digital pixels allowing a more highly accurate
determination of the center of light of the asteroid and the background objects.
The main drawback to using a CCD is it has a much smaller field of
view than a photographic plate.  Thus reduction of CCD observations require the
use of star catalogs with a much higher magnitude limit to provide enough stars
to determine the asteroid position.
<p>
The observations were originally reduced to the dynamical coordinate system at
a variety of epochs using several different methods.  They also use positions
of stars published in a variety of catalogs with varying degrees of accuracy.
As a result, only the most recent relative position observations are of an
accuracy comparable to that of the wide-angle observations.
<p>
The source for most of the relative observations used was the
<a href="#mpc 1997">Minor Planet Center (1997)</a>.  There are two advantages
to using the Minor Planet Center data rather than collecting it from its
original sources.  First, the data is collected in a single place saving time.
Second, unlike wide angle data which is reduced to apparent position of date,
relative data is reduced to an epoch.  The Minor Planet Center has provided the
transformation from the original epoch of publication to the epoch of J2000.0.
A total of 35,575 relative observations from 131 observatories were included.
<p>
<a href="#herget 1947">Herget (1947)</a> required that all observations
submitted to the MPC be on the B1950.0 coordinate system.  Earlier observations
have been collected by the MPC and converted to B1950.0 coordinates using the
information available along with the published observations.  In January 1992
when the MPC switched over to the J2000.0 coordinate system
<a href="#marsden 1991a">(Marsden 1991a)</a>.  The MPC then converted the
positions of all of the observations it had at that time from the B1950.0 to
the FK5/J2000.0 coordinate system using the procedures given on pages B42 and
B43 of the <i>Astronomical Almanac</i>, taking into account that these are
asteroids and not stars <a href="#marsden1991b">(Marsden 1991b)</a>.
<p>
However, it has always been the responsibility of the observer to reduce the
observations to the required coordinate system.  Thus it was necessary to
subject all observations, both relative and wide-angle to scrutiny to make sure
that there were no significant errors in the data.  How this was done is
described in <a href="#data weighting">Data Weighting</a>.
<p>
One other source of relative astronomical data was
<a href="#stone 1995-1997a">Stone (1995 - 1997a)</a> at the U.S. Naval
Observatory, Flagstaff Station.  The technique used for these high precision
observations is described in <a href="#stone 1997b">Stone (1997b)</a>.  These
data were extremely valuable because they provided very high accuracy data at
the most recent opposition of the asteroids.  This provides a very solid anchor
point for the modern end of the asteroid observations.

<h3><a name="radar data">RADAR DATA</a></h3>

Radar data has the potential of being the most useful of all the data types
because it is highly precise.  A good radar observation will give the position
of a body to a couple of kilometers.  The largest unknown is determining the
position of the center of reflection with respect to the center of mass.
Fortunately, radar mapping such as done by
<a href="#hudson & ostro 1995">Hudson & Ostro (1995)</a> helps in reducing this
uncertainty.
<p>
Radar data is also complementary to optical data.  Rather than producing
a place on the sky it produces a time delay or distance to the object and the
component of the velocity along the line of sight.  As a result, radar data has
been shown able to produce great improvements in asteroid ephemerides for those
asteroids with a rather small number of observations (
<a href="#yeomans et al 1992"> Yeomans et al. 1992</a>,
<a href="#hilton 1997">Hilton 1997</a>).
<p>
Until the recent upgrade of the Arecibo radio telescope, radar observations of
all but the largest main belt asteroids has been impossible.  To date the only
time delay-Doppler observations published for the asteroids whose ephemerides
are determined here are two observations of Iris by
<a href="#ostro et al 1991">Ostro et al. (1991)</a>.  These data were included
in the ephemeris of Iris.  Because the amount and span of other data on Iris is
large and the uncertainty in the time delay was rather large (42 km and
24 km) the contribution of the radar data to the ephemerides was rather
small.  The change in the orbital parameters was about 0.02 <i>sigma</i> and
the reduction in the formal uncertainties in the orbital parameters was about
0.01 <i>sigma</i> in the final solution.

<h3><a name="data weighting">DATA WEIGHTING</a></h3>

The accuracy of the observations varied significantly depending on the type of
observation, the equipment used, the observatory making the observation and the
epoch of the observation so, the weighting of the observations had to be
carefully considered.
<p>
First, the observations from each observatory were divided up into logical
groups.  Several criteria were used to determine what constituted a logical
group.  Easiest to determine were those observations that were published as
part of a catalog.  These data formed the bulk of the twentieth century,
wide angle observations.  The next criterion was for known changes of
equipment, reduction technique, catalog used for reduction, or position of an
observatory.  Next the records of each of the observatories were examined.  If
the observations from an observatory clustered around a set of epochs, those
observation near each epoch were identified as a logical group.  Finally, in
absence of no other information, groups were devised by dividing data into
groups at points where changes of equipment or techniques, such as the
introduction of the impersonal micrometer and atomic time, were known to have
been widely adopted.
<p>
The observations were then examined for relevance to the final solution.
Unless the observations of an asteroid from an observatory met one of the
following conditions, they were dropped from the final solution:

<ol>
	<li> Contributed at least 0.5% of the observations to the final solution
	<li> Observations were made before 1847
	<li> Observations were made during the first observed opposition of an
	asteroid
	<li> Observations were made during the most recently observed opposition
	of an asteroid
	<li> Observations were made at an opposition that would otherwise have
	no observations
</ol>

The total number of observations that remained for each asteroid are given in
Table 3.

</center>

<p>
All of the asteroids used data from their first observed opposition through
the most recent opposition given in Table 3.  Except for Davida and Interamnia
all of the asteroids are fit to substantially more data over substantially more
oppositions than the ephemerides described in <a href="#table 2">Table 2</a>.
As described in the section on <a href="#juno">Juno</a>, it was fit to 7318
observations in right ascension and 7174 observations in declination of a total
7428 observations covering 111 oppositions from 1839 through 1996 because there
are unaccounted for perturbations on Juno.  Observations from 1804 through
1838 were rejected.
<p>
The next step was to determine the root-mean-square error for each logical
grouping.  A single "catalog" root-mean-square error was produced for all of
the asteroids observed at an observatory over the time span of a logical
grouping.  An a priori root-mean-square error was assigned based on the age of
the observation and the technique used for obtaining it.  Initial ephemerides
were constructed and the difference between the a priori error and the actual
root-mean-square error for each logical group was examined to determine the
adjustment in the error.  Iterating with a new ephemerides calculated using the
new root-mean-square errors was possible, but in all cases a single iteration
was sufficient to determine the root-mean-square error of the observations.
For those catalogs contributing 500 or more observations to the ephemerides
corrections to the equinox and declination were also calculated.  Corrections
to the equinox and declination were applied to 70% of the relative observations
and 88% of the wide-angle observations.  Smaller data sets were examined for
deviation from zero in the mean residuals.  In all cases the corrections were
less than 1" and less than 1/5 of the root-mean-square error for any group of
observations, so they did not significantly affect either the root-mean-square
error or the final ephemerides.  Smaller data sets were examined for deviation
from zero in the mean residuals.  The root-mean-square error was then used to
directly weight the observations in each catalog.  Generally, except for the
modern CCD observations, the relative observations were a factor of 2 worse
than wide angle observations for a similar epoch.

<a name="physical_model"><center><h2>Physical Model</h2></center></a>

The planetary model used to determine the ephemerides of the asteroids is the
JPL ephemeris DE405.
<p>
The Planetary Ephemeris Program, PEP, is the software used for generating the
asteroid ephemerides (<a href="#ash 1965">Ash 1965</a>).  PEP is a high
accuracy program capable of generating ephemerides using complicated physical
models, comparing the results to many different observation types, adjusting
designated parameters and then producing a new set of ephemerides. PEP can
iterate the ephemerides until a desired level of convergence in the model
parameters is reached.  <a href="#standish 1987">Standish (1987)</a> compared a
set of PEP generated ephemerides with similar JPL ephemerides and found the
differences between those ephemerides were less than the uncertainties in the
ephemerides. In addition to adjusting physical model parameters, PEP can adjust
such parameters as catalog corrections in right ascension and declination,
electronic delay biases in delay-Doppler observations, and corrections in the
location of observatories.  The final ephemerides were integrated using PEP's
Adams-Moulton integrator with a step size of 2 days.  The epoch of integration
was 18 December 1997 (JD 2450800.5).
<p>
Asteroid perturbations are the largest source of incompletely modeled
perturbations of the planets especially Mars and the Earth-Moon barycenter.
<a href="#williams 1984">Williams (1984)</a> shows no less than seven asteroids
capable of making periodic perturbations of more than a kilometer to Mars.  The
largest asteroid, Ceres, has only 0.13% the mass of Mars and is located within
the asteroid belt itself.  Hence it and the other asteroids are much more
sensitive to the perturbations of the asteroids than are the planets.  Thus the
physical model for the asteroid ephemerides need to include perturbation by other asteroids.

Aside from the effect of the mass of Pallas on the mass determined for Ceres,

<p>
Why are these masses for Ceres so dependent on the mass of Pallas?  The answer
is that there is a degeneracy between the masses of Pallas and Ceres when
fitting observations to an orbit over a long period of time.  The reason for
this degeneracy is that the mean distances of Ceres and Pallas are very similar
(the synodic period of Ceres and Pallas, based on
<a href="#williams 1989">Williams (1989)</a> proper semi-major axes, is 2000
yr.) and Ceres and Pallas have similar mean longitudes (increasing from
approximately 1&#176 at the time of discovery of Pallas to 43&#176 in Dec.
1997).  As a result, if the mass of Pallas is fixed at a wrong value
difference in the perturbations of Pallas are propagated into the mass of
Ceres.  The earliest determinations of the mass of Ceres were made using Pallas
as the perturbed body, but suffered from systematic errors.  Figure 2 shows the
history of the values determined for the mass of Pallas.  The mass determined
here is about 1.5 <i>sigma</i> greater than the two most recent values for the
mass using Ceres as the perturbed body; however, it is in good agreement with
the mass determined using the Viking lander data, in red.  The blue point near
the final mass in green was a preliminary mass determined using approximately
half the data in the final solution.  As Figure 1 shows, using the historic
values for the mass of Pallas brings the mass of Ceres into perfect agreement
with most of the recent determinations of the mass of Ceres.  Thus it is the
difference in the mass determined for Pallas that changes the mass determined
for Ceres.  In the case of <a href="#kuzmanoski 1995">Kuzmanoski (1995)</a> the
act of treating the encounter as an impulse allowed the author to look only at
the immediate effect of Ceres on Pompeja and ignored the long term effect of
Pallas inherent in the traditional fitting the data to an improved physical
model approach.
<p>
Ceres' orbit is mildly eccentric (0.097) and inclined 9&#176.7 to the ecliptic,
while Pallas' orbit is more eccentric (0.180) and inclined 35&#176.7 to the
ecliptic.  Hence Ceres and Pallas are physically close only at the nodes of
their orbits, even though they have similar mean distances and mean longitudes.
This does not affect the degeneracy in determining the masses of Ceres and
Pallas, however, because the observed effect is the average perturbation of
Pallas over several orbits.

<a name="#pallas"><center><h3>PALLAS</h3></center></a>

Since an accurate determination of the mass of Ceres depends upon determining
the mass of Pallas accurately, the accuracy of the mass of Pallas needs to be
addressed.  The mass determined has been found to be very robust.  As long as
the data set covers the full time span of Ceres and Pallas observations, the
mass did not change significantly.  Nor did it change significantly when the
only the mass of Pallas was solved for or if it was solved for simultaneously
with the masses of Ceres and Vesta.  Finally, the 1 <i>sigma</i> error is only
20% that of previous mass estimates.  The mass of Pallas is not based on a
single encounter with Ceres but on a series of close encounters that occurred
in the years shortly after the discovery of Pallas early in the nineteenth
century.  Hence, the mass determined is most sensitive to the oldest, least
accurate data.  That data also have the greatest chance of containing
unaccounted systematic errors.  The possibility of systematic errors is reduced
by using as many sources as possible, but this does not guarantee their
elimination.  Thus confirmation of the mass of Pallas using another technique
or a different perturbed asteroid is desirable.
<p>
The one existing alternative technique is
<a href="#standish & hellings 1989">Standish & Hellings (1989)</a>.  Here the
masses for Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta are determined using the Viking lander
ranging data.  Just as the mass of Pallas found here is nearly 1 <i>sigma</i>
above the <a href="#standish & hellings 1989">Standish & Hellings</a> mass, the
mass for Ceres is nearly 1 <i>sigma</i> smaller, reflecting the degeneracy in
determining their masses.  However,
<a href="#standish et al 1995">Standish, et al. (1995)</a> reverted to a lower
mass for Pallas for DE403 without explanation.
<p>
Looking for other perturbed asteroids is difficult because Pallas is in a
highly inclined, eccentric orbit, reducing the number of close encounters.
Those close encounters that do occur are usually at high velocity, reducing the
size of the perturbation caused by Pallas.  The best candidate found, so far,
is 2495 Noviomagnum which encountered Pallas on 1 Jan. 1991 at a minimum
distance of 0.036 AU (<a href="#hilton et al 1996">Hilton, et al. 1996</a>).
Unfortunately, fitting to existing observations with Pallas as a perturbing
body changes the right ascension by only 0."12 twenty years after the encounter
when compared to ephemerides generated without Pallas as a perturbing body.

<a name="#vesta"><center><h3>VESTA</h3></center></a>

Figure 3 shows the history of the determination of masses for Vesta.  Along
with the final mass in green, there are two preliminary masses using Ceres and
197 Arete as the perturbed asteroid.  All of them are in good agreement with
the most recent previous determinations.  The greatest change was caused by
switching from DE200 to DE405 as the source of planetary ephemerides.  As with
Ceres and Pallas, the mass of Vesta determined here has a significantly smaller
uncertainty than the mass determination from the Viking lander data, the most
recent determination prior to this one.  The smaller uncertainty is a
reflection of the fact that although the Viking lander observations are orders
of magnitude more accurate than optical observations, the size of the
perturbations of the asteroids on Mars is much smaller and the Viking lander
data spans only 5% of the period covered by the optical data.

The final masses here were determined using a simultaneous solution for the
masses of all three asteroids.  Masses for all three asteroids were determined
using a variety of observation data sets and initial conditions.  The masses of
Ceres and Vesta were also determined using other perturbed asteroids.  Aside
from the dependence of the mass determined for Ceres on the mass used for
Pallas, all of the masses are robust.  The masses determined in all other cases
were within 1.5 <i>sigma</i> of the final masses.  Thus, the mass uncertainties
are quite realistic.

<a name="asteroid densities"><h3>ASTEROID DENSITIES</h3></a>

New masses for Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta also give new opportunities for
determining the densities of asteroids.
<p>
The volume of Ceres is based on the observation of a stellar occultation of
BD+8&#176 471 by Ceres <a href="#millis et al 1987">(Millis et al. 1987)</a>.
The equatorial radius was determined to be 479.6 &#177 2.4 km and the polar
radius is 466.3 &#177 4.5 km.  Assuming that Ceres is nearly spheroidal in
shape the mean radius is then 466.3 &#177 5.7 km.  This mean radius is in very
good agreement with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of Ceres
<a href="#merline et al 1996">(Merline et al. 1996)</a>.  The area of Ceres was
found to consist of 240 pixels with a linear dimension of 53 km.  The mean
radius from the HST images is thus 463 km.  The derived volume for Ceres is
(42.5 &#177 0.9) &#215 10<sup>7</sup> km<sup>3</sup> which gives a mean density
of Ceres is 2.05 &#177 0.05 gm cm<sup>-3</sup>.  This density is significantly
greater than the density of the taxonomically similar 253 Mathilde (volume
80000 &#177 12000 km<sup>3</sup> and density 1.3 &#177 0.2 gm cm<sup>-3}</sup>)
<a href="#veverka et al 1997">(Veverka et al. 1997)</a>.  Since Ceres is nearly
8500 times more massive than Mathilde, the difference in the density could be
caused by greater compaction or a minimal amount of differentiation rather than
a major difference in composition.  Or, since Ceres is a G-type asteroid
(considered a sub-type of the C-type asteroids) while Mathilde is a C-type
asteroid (<a href="#tholen 1989">Tholen 1989</a>), compositional differences
may account for the difference in density.
<p>
No HST images for Pallas exist.  However, there are several determinations of
Pallas' shape based on stellar occultations and speckle interferometry (
<a href="#lambert 1985">Lambert, 1985</a>;
<a href="#magnuson 1986">Magnuson, 1986</a>;
<a href="#drummond & cocke 1988">Drummond & Cocke, 1988</a>).  All of these
papers yield similar results.  For the final density calculation, the spheroid
of Drummond & Cocke, 570 &#177 22 &#215 525 &#177 4 &#215 482 &#177 15 km, was
used.  This spheroid is based on a combination of three stellar occultations
and speckle interferometry. The derived volume of Pallas is (7.6 &#177 0.4)
&#215 10<sup>7</sup> km<sup>3</sup>.  The density is 4.2 &#177 0.3 gm
cm<sup>-3</sup>.
<p>
<a href="#thomas et al 1997">Thomas, et al. (1997)</a> have determined a mean
radius for Vesta of 265 &#177 5 km which gives a volume of (7.8 &#177 0.3)
&#215 10<sup>7</sup> km<sup>3</sup>.  The derived density is 4.3 &#177 0.3 gm.
cm<sup>-3</sup>.
<p>
<a name="ephemeris"><center><h2>Ephemerides</h2></center></a>
<p>
The integration of the asteroid orbits, computation of the (O - C)s, and
adjustment of parameters to produce the ephemerides was carried out using PEP.
The adjusted parameters in the solution were the osculating elements of the
asteroids, the masses of Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta, and the catalog corrections
for the 49 catalogs of observations that contributed 500 or more observations
to the asteroid ephemerides.  The total number of adjusted parameters was 191.
The epoch of integration was 18 Dec. 1997 (JD 2450800.5).
<p>
The determination of catalog corrections had little effect upon the ephemerides
generated.  In all cases the adjustment was less than 1" and a factor of 1/5 or
less of the mean uncertainty in the observations.  Not adjusting the catalog
corrections changed the ephemerides by only 10<sup>-6</sup> AU in semi-major
axis, 10<sup>-7</sup> in eccentricity, and 0."004 in the angular elements in
the most extreme case.    The change in apparent position on June 21.5, 1800
between the ephemeris with catalog corrections and that without catalog
corrections is 0."5 or about 17% of the root-mean-square uncertainty of
observations from that time period.
<p>
The  final ephemerides generated for all fifteen asteroids were generated
covering the period November 16, 1799 (JD 2378450.5) through February 1, 2100
(JD 2488100.5) with a tabular interval of 2 days.  The ephemerides give
the position and velocity of each asteroid in equatorial rectangular
coordinates on the mean equator and equinox of J2000.0.  The positions are
given in Astronomical Units (AU) and the velocities are in AU day<sup>-1</sup>.
<p>
The osculating equatorial elements for the asteroids and their formal
uncertainties for the final ephemerides are given in Table 7.  The epoch for
the elements is Dec. 18, 1997 (JD 2540800.5).

Comparing the uncertainty in mean longitude and mean motion with Table 2 of
<a href="#standish 1986">Standish (1986)</a> shows that the uncertainties in
these ephemerides compare very favorably with the uncertainties of the outer
planets in DE200.  Thus the formal errors give ephemerides that compare very
favorably with DE200.
<p>
What then are the realistic uncertainties in the ephemerides?  The least
squares adjustment of parameters assumes that the physical model has no
unaccounted for perturbations.  The truth is all of these asteroids are in the
main belt and have much smaller masses than the planets.  Hence, unaccounted
perturbations by other asteroids may cause departures from these ephemerides
that are potentially significantly worse than the uncertainties given in Table
8.  Juno, as discussed below, is an example of unaccounted for perturbations.
Examination of Juno's ephemeris shows that the realistic uncertainties are, at
most, by a factor of five or so greater than the formal uncertainties.

<a name="residuals"><h3>RESIDUALS</h3></a>

Figures 5 through 19 shows the residuals in right ascension and declination
for the observations of each of the asteroid ephemerides.  The red bar shows
the 3 <i>sigma</i> scatter in each twenty year era of observations.  The number

As expected, there is a drop in the root-mean-square value of the residuals
over time.  Those residuals from the early nineteenth century have a 3
<i>sigma</i> root-mean-square value of approximately 9" while the 3
<i>sigma</i> root-mean-square value for the last twenty years of the twentieth
century is approximately 2".  What is not expected is, aside from Ceres,
Pallas, Juno, and Vesta, the root-mean-square value of the residuals varies
widely between 1900 and 1960.  There are two reasons for these root-mean-square
values of the residuals.
</p>
<p>
First, the early twentieth century is a period during which few astrometric
observations were made of most asteroids.  As a result the statistics during
this time period are poor.  For example:
<ol>
<li>	There is an apparent "kink" in the residuals of Vesta between 1910 and
	1915.  Examination of the residuals in detail reveal that the kink
	contains only 12 observations all made at the same observatory.  This
	observatory has provided several hundred other observations of Vesta
	during and other asteroids over period from 1905 to 1920. None of the
	observations show a systematic departure from 0 in the residuals.  Hence
	the "kink" is a statistical fluke.
<li>	There are only 6 observations of Hebe between 1901 and 1930.
<li>	There are only 6 observations of Metis between 1887 and 1938.
<li>	There are only 9 observations of Eunomia between 1887 and 1932.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Second, During the early part of the twentieth century, several new
observatories, such as Bucharest, Athens, Purple Mountain, Santiago-San
Bernardo, and Madrid, began contributing observations that were significantly
worse, at least initially, than the older established observatories.  As
described in <a href="#data weighting">Data Weighting</a>, the observations
from these observatories were examined to make sure that they did not
contain systematic errors.  In some cases, these observatories contributed a
large number of observations significantly increasing root-mean-square value of
the residuals for some eras.  For example, the Bucharest Observatory
contributed 2863 observations; however, the root-mean-square value of the
residuals of the Bucharest observations was 5.1 times greater than similar
observations at other observatories during the same era.

<a name="juno"><h3>Juno</h3></a>

Figure 7, the residuals for Juno, show residuals for Juno beginning in 1839
although Juno was discovered in 1804.  No observations prior to 1839 were used
in determining the final ephemeris of Juno.  The reason for cutting off the
observations prior to 1839 is shown in Figure 20, the residuals for Juno for
its entire observed history.  There is an obvious systematic departure of the
residuals in right ascension between 1804 and 1839.  Table 9 shows that the
mean residual in right ascension is large throughout the nineteenth century,
and is particularly large before 1840.  The observations prior to 1830 are from
two different observatories.  Observations from both observatories show the
same systematic drift in the residuals of Juno and they do not show systematic
drifts in the residuals for Ceres, Pallas, or Vesta.  Hence, this deviation is
almost certainly caused by an encounter with an unmodeled asteroid during the
mid- to late-nineteenth century.

A search for perturbing asteroids showed close approaches by Psyche and Davida
and an approach with a minimum distance of several tenths of an AU by
Interamnia.  Other large asteroids known to come within a few tenths of an AU
of Juno during the nineteenth century are 24 Themis, 87 Sylvia, and 216
Kleopatra.  However, inclusion of these bodies as perturbers was able to
account for only 20% of the runoff in the ephemeris of Juno.  Thus, to remove
the effect of the unmodeled perturbation, the observations prior to 1839, the
point at which the deviation of the mean residuals becomes greater than 1/3
<i>sigma</i>, were removed from the final ephemeris.

<p>
The change in the initial conditions for Juno resulting from removing the data
prior to 1839 was approximately four times the formal uncertainty in the
initial conditions.  This allows an estimate of the upper limits of the
realistic uncertainties with respect to the formal uncertainties in the
ephemerides.  None of the other ephemerides show any obvious departures such as
Juno does.  Thus it is likely that the effect of any unmodeled encounters for
the other asteroids produce changes in the orbits of the asteroids that result
in changes in the ephemerides of, at most, a few tenths of an arc second.

<p>
Duncombe's ephemerides are old enough that at the time they were computed the
only asteroid with a known mass was Vesta.  Hence, there were no asteroid
perturbations included in these ephemerides.  The comparison with
<b>USNO/AE97</b> shows the effects of asteroid perturbations on these four
large asteroids.

<p>
Ceres, the most massive of the asteroids by a factor of 2.7, shows a systematic
offset of -0."5 in right ascension and some minor fluctuations in right
ascension, declination, and distance.  These are the result of recent
encounters with Vesta which has an orbital period near 3/4 that of Ceres.  The
last really close encounter between these two asteroids was in 1962, but they
do approach to a few tenths of an AU about every 14 years.

<p>
Pallas has very little difference between the <b>USNO/AE97</b> ephemeris and
the Duncombe ephemeris.  This is a result of its highly inclined, highly
eccentric orbit which does not bring it within 1.5 AU of either Ceres or Vesta
in this century.

<p>
Juno shows two definite deviations from the Duncombe ephemerides.  The first,
small deviation is from an encounter with Pallas.  The two asteroids did not
get particularly close together, the minimum distance was several tenths of an
AU, but they were reasonably close for nearly four years.  The second, stronger
deviation is the result of an encounter with 511 Davida.  Notice that the peaks
in the deviations of right ascension and declination do not coincide.  The
symmetry is broken because Juno approached Davida from below and behind, that
is Juno started out on the south side of Davida's orbital plane as defined by
the right hand rule and  from a smaller mean longitude.  Juno then passed in
front of Davida after passing though Davida's orbital plane.  The resulting
encounter was symmetric enough that any long term effect from the encounter is
too small to see at this scale.  The symmetric nature of the perturbation of
Juno by Davida is unfortunate because there is no reliable determination of the
mass of Davida and the two year period of the deviation in Juno's orbit is too
short to provide a good determination from existing data.  An attempt to
determine the mass of Davida from its perturbation of Juno resulted in a mass
with an uncertainty of about 200%.

<p>
Vesta shows the largest deviation from the Duncombe ephemerides.  This is a
result of its frequent encounters with Ceres.  The mean systematic deviation of
1."0 in right ascension is in the opposite direction as the systematic
deviation of Ceres and is nearly what would be naively expected from the ratio
of the mass of Vesta to the mass of Ceres.  The sudden change in the
declination difference in 1999 is a result of the most recent encounter between
Vesta and Ceres.

<a name="conclusions"> <center><h2> Conclusions </h2></center> </a>

A new set of ephemerides, <b>USNO/AE98</b>, for 15 of the largest asteroids for
use in the <i>Astronomical Almanac</i>.  The ephemerides  cover the period from
1800 through 2050.
<p>
A total of 59,258 optical and 2 radar observations were used to fit the
ephemerides.  Except for Juno the observations cover the period from the
discovery of the asteroid to the most recent opposition with observations
available.  Observations for Juno prior to 1839 were not included because
the residuals in preliminary ephemerides indicated that Juno has an unmodeled
encounter with another large asteroid that resulted in a systematic drift
between the ephemeris and the observations.  Only those observations from
1839 or later were used to remove the effect of the unmodeled perturbation on
the rest of the ephemeris.
<p>
As a part of improving the ephemerides, new masses were determined for Ceres,
Pallas, and Vesta, the three largest asteroids.  These masses are: Ceres =
(4.39 &#177 0.04) &#215 10<sup>-10</sup> M<sub>Sun</sub>, Pallas = (1.59 &#177 0.05) &#215 10<sup>-10</sup> M<sub>Sun</sub>, Vesta = (1.69 &#177 0.11) &#215
10<sup>-10</sup> M<sub>Sun</sub>.  The mass for Ceres is smaller than most
previous determinations of its mass.  This smaller mass is a direct consequence
of the increase in the mass determined for Pallas over previous determinations.
The determination of the mass of Pallas from its effect on Ceres depends
critically on the oldest, least accurate data.  Hence it is desirable to make an independent determination of Pallas' mass.  The mass determined by
<a href="#standish & hellings 1989">Standish & Hellings (1989)</a> from Mars
Viking observations is in accord with the mass determined here.  Nor are there
are any known good candidates that are significantly perturbed by Pallas.
<p>
The densities for these three asteroids are 2.05 &#177 0.05 gm. cm<sup>-3</sup>
for Ceres, 4.2 &#177 0.3 gm. cm<sup>-3</sup> for Pallas and 4.3 &#177 0.3 gm.
cm<sup>-3</sup> for Vesta.  The density for Ceres is significantly greater than
that of the taxonomically similar asteroid 253 Mathilde, or it may represent a
difference between the C-type asteroids (Mathilde) and the G-Type asteroids
(Ceres).  This greater density likely represents a greater compaction of the
far larger Ceres.
<p>
The internal accuracy of the ephemerides at epoch (Dec. 18, 1997 JD 2450800.5)
ranges from 0."05 for Iris through 0."22 for Cybele and the uncertainty in the
mean motion varies from 0."02 cen.<sup>-1</sup> for Vesta to 0."14
cen.<sup>-1</sup> for Davida.  This compares very favorably with the internal
errors for the outer planets in DE200.  However, because the asteroids have
relatively little mass and are subject to perturbations by other asteroids the
actual uncertainties in their mean motions are no more than five times the
internal error.  Aside from Juno, there is no evidence of any large unmodeled
perturbations, so their ephemerides should be good to an uncertainty of a few
tenths of an arcsecond..
<p>
Comparison of the <b>USNO/AE98</b> ephemerides with the older Duncombe
ephemerides for the period of 1990 to 2000 of Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta
show some differences.  These differences can be mainly attributed to the
perturbation of asteroids included in this model that were not included in the
Duncombe ephemerides.
