INTERVIEW BY: MATCH MAGAZINE<br>
DATE: 30 January 1999<p></center><br>

Did you always want to be a footballer?<br>
"Yeah, all the time. I've never really been good at much else. I was never very good academically, but I alwats fancied being a footballer. When I was young I was a Chelsea fan, although I'm from Camden which is Arsenal territory, but I've changed. I'm a Hammer now."<p>

When Did you join the ranks at West Ham?<br>
"It was five or six years ago when i was about eleven. There were a few other clubs interested in London and a few northern clubs. West Ham just appealed to me when I went there for a look. I went to Manchester United, which is a great club, but I think the overall set-up at West Ham is the best. You see people like Frank lampard and Rio Ferdinand, and there are others on the verge of coming through. Mani Omoyimni and lee Hodges are quality players coming through and there are more on the way, so it's looking good"<p>

Do you model yourself on anyone?<br>
"Not really. I liked Paul Gascoigne a lot in his prime. I still think he can do it now. I like Michael Owen and David Beckham, but I don't model myself on one player, I try to take the qualities of all of them."<p>

How would you describe yourself as a player?<br>
"I'm an attacking midfielder, a goalscorer every now and then. I'm not saying I can't defend, but it's not really my role. I play where someone like Juninho would play"<p>

How do your mates feel about all of your success?<br>
"They're fine, they love it. There's no jealousy, they're pleased when things go well. I've got good mates at home and they help to keep my feet on the ground. Not that I'd let anything go to my head."<p>

Did you miss your family in your time at Lilleshall?<br>
"Yeah, a lot. You do get homesick now and then, but that's part of football these days. When you hopefully go to a World Cup and European Championships you've got to deal with it. You've got to live with boys around your own age and get on with them, whether you like them or not."<p>

Do you find all the media attention strange?<br>
"It is strange because I haven't really done anything in football. People are saying I'm going to be the new this and the new that and it's just not the case. All I am is a 17-year-old enjoying his football. People can say what they think I can do, but until I do it, it's speculation. It's putting more and more pressure on me to do these things when who knows? A couple of years down the line I might not be good enough to do them."<p>

So what do you see as your short-term aims?<br>
"I broke my toes on holiday, but I'm fully fit again now. I'm playing in the Under-19's and in the reserves, but I don't really look further than the next game. It's lovely to have people speculating about me getting into the first team regularly, but I think that's a bit far off. There are a lot of quality players at the club. It's the best it's been for a few years, so it's going to be really hard to break through."<p>

What about your rumoured boot deal?<br>
"It's not a deal. Adidas sort me out with boots and clothing. There's no money involved. There's no need for money at my age. I'm not interested in it and they're not interested in giving it to me. They just give me boots and I'm happy with that. My dad looks after me. There's no need for an agent because I haven't got any money or anything. i'm just a teenager playing football."<!-- text below generated by server.
