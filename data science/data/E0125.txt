Alan Balmer is the 
              owner of Balmer Consulting, and is a veteran of over 20 years of 
              experience in all aspects of computing; from mainframes to microcomputers, 
              from design to debugging. His undergraduate work was 
              in physics and theoretical math, with a minor in chemistry, and 
              he has spent time as a logic circuit designer, electronics engineer 
              and NIR spectroscopy researcher, with an interesting but not 
              habit-forming excursion into management. He has been a member of 
              Team Powersoft, then Team Sybase, since the Compuserve days. His 
              software career began by writing circuit design programs in Fortran 
              and progressed to work on real-time process control operating 
              systems. He is (or has been) reasonably fluent in several 
              assembler languages, C, C++, Perl, Java, FORTRAN, BASIC, PASCAL, 
              and PL/I, and now thinks Python is neat. Al is now based in 
              Phoenix, Arizona, USA, and does a variety of things, from small business 
              consulting to writing device drivers for process 
              control, but spends the majority of his time writing C on Unix 
              systems for a manufacturer of card-based transaction and security 
              systems. Al enjoys writing tools and though interested in everything, 
              will likely concentrate on the Watcom auxiliary programs, 
              leaving the heavy-duty compiler work to younger and smarter 
              colleagues. You can contact Alan via email at

Craig is now a closet developer as he has 
              taken on a CEO role at Action Engine (<A 
              href="http://www.actionengine.com">http://www.actionengine.com</A>). 
              He worked at Watcom from 1989 to 1993, on versions 8.0 through 
              9.5.  He was reponsible for developing the Windows extender 
              (win386), the editor, the win16/win32/win386/os2 2 debuggers, the 
              win16/win32 runtime libraries and various and sundry other things 
              before moving to Microsoft in 1993. While at Microsoft, Craig was 
              the founding developer for the DirectX project, and left in 
              January of 2000 after spending almost 2 years as the General 
              Manager of the Windows Media Platform group. Craig is 
              still in Redmond, WA, having a blast doing the startup thing, and 
              among other things is doing programming for the Palm OS where his 
              16 bit, low memory, slow processor experience is finally paying 
              off. After all this time, Craig still secretly wishes he was 
              playing poker with his Watcom buddies again. You can contact Craig

Stephen has 
              been programming in C since 1985, C++ since 1996 
              and assembler since sometime in the dark distant past, 
              mostly on Microsoft Operating Systems. Stephen has used every 
              version of Watcom C/C++ since 1987 (version 7.0), and has also 
              used just about every version of Microsoft C, C++  BASIC 
              compilers since 1984. Stephen has been a member of TeamSybase, the 
              official Sybase support team for the Sybase News Server since 
              1996, supporting Watcom C/C++ and more recently Watcom Fortran. 
              Stephen has good knowledge on 16 and 32-bit DOS, 16 and 
              32-bit Windows and as part of he Open Watcom group expects to 
              be looking at the C, C++ and Fortran compilers as well as WASM and 
              the C, C++ and Fortran runtime libraries. Stephen maintains

Timur Tabi is the world's sexiest 
              OS/2 developer. When he's not modeling men's underwear for 
              Victoria's Secret, he writes OS/2 and Linux device drivers. 
              Timur's list of accomplishments, both with and without his clothes 
              on, are too numerous to include here, but you can get an idea of 
              just how studly he is by visiting his web site at <A 
              href="http://www.tabi.org/timur/index.html">http://www.tabi.org/timur/index.html</A>. As 
              a member of the Open Watcom group, Timur will be concentrating on 
              enhancing the OS/2-specific areas of the compiler, but will probably

              Kerouac and Alen Ginsberg. He recalls Burroughs saying , “I have an 
                          exercise I learned from a Mafia Don in Ohio: see everybody on the street 
                          before they see you. It's quite interesting actually because, if you see 
                          everyone before they see you, they won't see you. And then you'll find 
                          that somebody beat you.“ You can contact Jason via email at <a href="mailto:jasonq@scitechsoft.com">

As part of the process of preparing the source code for release under an Open Source license, SciTech Software and a select group of external developers will create and distribute a binary patch upgrade release (11.0c) on the Open Watcom web site. This binary patch will be available free of charge to existing Watcom C/C++ and Fortran customers and will include all updates and bug fixes developed by Sybase since the last commercial update of the product (11.0b).

Hence in order to utilise the 11.0c binary patch release, you will need an official copy of the 11.0, 11.0a or 11.0b installation CD.

<tr><!-- next Part --><!--wide--><td colspan=1 bgcolor=#CBD1E9>Initially the Open Watcom 1.0 compiler will require an official copy of the Watcom C/C++ 11.0b compiler, with the 11.0c binary patch release applied in order to successfully compile it. This is due to the need to rely upon proprietry SDK's for platforms such as Windows, and OS/2 that cannot be distributed along with the Open Source 1.0 compiler release. It is planned to eliminate this dependency in the Open Source 2.0 release, by allowing the compiler to work with freely downloadable SDK's for the supported platforms.
