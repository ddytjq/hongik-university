<B>After the musical revivals of the 60s and 70s, prepare yourself for the debut revival of the 80s. Not only is the sound of the 80s on its way back, but also some of the biggest bands from the so called <B>New Romantics</B> or <B>New Popwave</B> have begun to produce and hit the road again. Last Christmas <B>Wham</B> released their (maybe) definitively last greatest hits album, <B>Culture Club</B> have just embarked on a reunion world tour, kicking of in the USA, and the likes of <B>Duran Duran</B>, <B>Bananarama</B> and <B>Nik Kershaw</B> are cutting new grooves in the studio.</B><P>
So why the revival? Pen poised music journos are currently pulling together theories on why for their next editions, and before  the 80s vibes hit the streets and swamp the clubland and record outlets. Some argue that it's a matter of timing - a perfect distance for people to look at it with fresh eyes. Others are suggesting that it's because the 80s was a time where the music scenes most stylistic groups created such strong images that they have nailed themselves into our musical conscience, and we can now give them a new lease of life by trading their naff factor with a kitsch value. Critics whose interest fall into the camp of the organic nature of music are suggesting that the 80s is the perfect recipe to influence the much needed new edge for pop. They believe that that pop music has had its radar out for new simple elements and components to move it on from the essential over-stylish formula that the 90s has demanded from it.<P>
Like any other youth culture, the 80s was far from one-dimensional. It defined itself in various forms and developed over time. It was England alone that created the <B>New Romantics</B> and <B>New Popwave</B>. No nation like the English has been as good at creating a broad supply of youth cultures with music, clothes, hairstyles and club scenes to match. While groups in the beginning of the 80s continued the so called <B>Post-Punk</B> scene (<B>The Damned</B>), there were many others for whom the only alternative to all the inward looking depressive melodies and lyrics was party, colour, glamour and technicolor escapism. The saviour for these came in the form of the synthesiser, disco beats and the <B>Soul Boy</B> subculture.<P>
By building a bridge between two contrary traditions - punk and disco - <B>New Popwave</B> created the foundation for a new type of mainstream music. Names like <B>Culture Club</B>, <B>Duran Duran</B>, <B>Spandau Ballet</B>, <B>Human League</B>, <B>Heaven 17</B> and <B>ABC</B> developed in their different forms a special kind of English disco where there was also room for <B>African drum patterns</B>, <B>Latin American rhythms</B>, <B>reggae</B>, <B>funk</B>, <B>soul</B> and <B>jazz</B> to fuse.<P>
The English popscene in the early 80s was also glamorous, extravagant, romantic and visual like never before. The pop idols surpassed each other with imaginative looks, and they played with the possibilities of the sexes (<B>Boy George</B>, <B>Pete Burns</B>, <B>Marilyn</B>) and androgyny (<B>Annie Lennox</B>, cropped, suited and booted for the aptly entitled <B>Who's That Girl</B> video). The stylist, hairdresser and designer were just as important as the record producer, in a way never seen before.<P>
The pop culture between 1980 and 1985 was in many ways caught between the punk and new-conservatism. On one hand it was a sharp ridiculed commentary to Thatcherism and its dream of a polished and perfect society where good conservative deeds ruled and where men were real men (<B>Billy Idol</B>) - without eyeliner. On the other hand <B>New Popwave</B> lived up to all Thatchers ideal expectations of the young, resourceful, nouveau rich Englishmen (<B>Spandau Ballet</B>, <B>Duran Duran</B>, <B>ABC</B>). It wasn't a rebellious pop culture, it was all about sales, looks, export drive and money at the expense of social indignation and youthful anger.<P>
It's a question of time before we see what shape the 80s revival will take. Maybe it will start to influence the melodic direction of up and coming sounds, maybe it will just be a short lived nostalgic event, or maybe the old bands will just begin to re-invent their sounds and style to fit in with what we know to be typically 90s. Watch this space.<P>
