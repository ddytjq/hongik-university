<H2>Goals per season</H2>

<p>Does modernisation of football affect on number of goals scored? These are 
  the statistics involving all matches in European cups from 1955/56 to 2001/02.<br>

<p>Conclusion: After few first years of European cups, ugly defense tactic was 
  presented by H. Herrera in 1964/65 and after that number of goals has decreased 
  just slightly. Note that the poorest season was 14 years ago - 1987/88.</p>
