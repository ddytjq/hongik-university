<P>&quot;Creationism&quot; is the name given to the belief that
the creation story of Genesis is the literal truth about how the
world came into being. According to Christian creationists, the
universe and everything in it was created by God in six days,
at a time which biblical scholars have calculated to be just over
6000 years ago. Up until the late nineteenth century it was quite
possible to believe in the scientific world picture and also in
the biblical story of creation, because science itself did not
have any particular account of creation. But in the past 150 years
scientists have gradually pieced together their own accounts of
how life and the universe began. These accounts differ significantly
from the literal account in Genesis, and so they present a significant
challenge to Christian believers.</P>

<P>The scientific account of the creation of life was kicked off
by Charles Darwin in the mid-nineteenth century. He put forward
the theory that all life evolves by processes of &quot;<!g><A HREF="../biogloss/natsel-body.html">natural
selection</a>.&quot; According to Darwin, life began with very simple
creatures, which gradually evolved over millions of years into
more complex forms. Eventually this process gave rise to human
beings. Likewise in the twentieth century, physicists and <!g><A HREF="../physgloss/cosml-body.html">cosmologists</a>
have worked out a scientific account of how the universe came
into being. Again, this account says that in the beginning - at
the moment of the <!g><A HREF="../physgloss/bigbang-body.html">big bang</a> - the universe came into being in a
very simple state that gradually evolved over millions of years
into ever more complex forms. Again, the process did not happen
in a week, but over extremely long periods of time.</P>

<P>The scientific accounts of biological and cosmological evolution
are supported by vast amounts of evidence and data. Yet creationists
reject this evidence. Not only that, in recent decades they have
developed what is often-called &quot;creation science&quot;. Creation
scientists aim to demonstrate through the methods of science itself
that the Genesis account is essentially correct. A key component
of this effort is &quot;flood geology&quot;. Flood geologists
- some of whom are card-carrying Phd's in geology - look at the
geological and fossil record and argue that the correct interpretation
of the evidence is that the earth is really 6000 years old. According
to flood geologists, the massive crevice of the Grand Canyon is
evidence that there was a vast flood just as the Bible depicts
in the story of Noah.</P>

<P>Creation science and flood geology are not just &quot;stupid&quot;
exercises (as is often said). They are attempts on the part of
people of sincere belief to reconcile their faith with science.
But what is troubling about such efforts is that by turning their
beliefs into scientific form creationists are able to argue that
what they are offering is simply an alternative scientific theory.
On these grounds, they are beginning to push for a creationist
perspective to be taught in sciences classes at school. Rather
than being anti-science, creationists have realized that they
can enlist science as their ally. It is just this kind of fusion,
that science educators need to very wary about.</P>
