					<p>The SWTR points out in a press release from 29 May 2002, that research in Switzer-land is currently in a crisis because not enough funding is being invested in science. This delays urgently necessary reforms for increasing the efficiency of the education and research systems. Switzerland is on it's way to losing it's top position in research and technology, which does not bode well for the future of the country.</p>
<p>The program, published in a brochure, makes recommendations on the following points:</p>
<p>1. Structure reforms of the Swiss university system</p>
<p>2. Career structure for next-generation academics</p>
<p>3. Targeted support of long-term research</p>
<p>4. Strengthening of the humanities and social sciences</p>
<p>5. Strengthening of clinical research</p>
<p>6. Improving information transfer and innovation</p>
<p>7. Establishing a Department of Science, Education and Culture</p>
<p>8. Increasing research expenditures</p>
<p>9. Opening the universities more to the public</p>
