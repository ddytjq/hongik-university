          <b>What could you afford to borrow?</b><br><br>
          This depends on your circumstances - how much you earn,
          what your other commitments are and how much your property 
          is worth.
          </p>
          <p>
          Of course we have guidelines on what we could lend you, but 
          the starting point should always be how much you could
          comfortably afford each month.  Why not use the <a href="Detailedbudget.asp?si={B674BB2E-B694-4617-A2DB-61B7EEE72815}">budget planner</a> to help work this out.
          </p>
          <p>
          <b>Our lending guidelines</b><br><br>
          We can usually lend you up to 95% of the total value of your 
          home.  This is called the 'loan to value' - often abbreviated to LTV.
          <br><br>
          The table below shows how much we could lend, depending on your income, and how much you want to borrow as a percentage of the value of your home.

		  <p>If the loan to value of your mortgage is greater than 85%, and either your income (or the higher income if it is a joint application) is less than £18,000 or you are a first time buyer and are using a 'gifted deposit' to buy your house, different income multiples will apply. In these instances we could lend you up to 3x your single income, or if it is a joint application 3x your income plus 1x the second income, or 2.5x the joint income.
		  <p>
		  <b>Higher loan to value mortgages</b></br></br>
		  
		  If the amount of your mortgage is high in comparison to the value of your home, there is an increased risk of loss to the Society in the event of repossession.  For this 
		  reason, a charge is made against loans that exceed 90% of the value of the property or 
		  the purchase price, whichever is the lower.  This is called the High Loan to Value fee.
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>
		  The amount of the High Loan to Value fee that is charged is based on the difference between the 
		  amount you borrow and 75% of the valuation or purchase price, whichever is the 
		  lower.  The current HLTV fee rate is £7.25 per £100 of that difference.
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>
		  <b>
		  Please also note that the High Loan to Value fee protects the Society only. Although you 
		  have to pay the charge if your loan to value is over 90%, you are still liable for any loss 
		  that may be incurred if the Society has to repossess your home.
