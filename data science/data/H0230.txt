                <hr><h4><i>&quotPredictability of bioremediation process
                performance cannot be made with a high level of confidence.&quot
                </i> (Gibson and Sayler, 1992).</h4><hr>
                
                The foundation of bioremediation has been the natural ability of
                microorganisms to degrade organic compounds (Atlas, 1995). 
                Bioremediation is defined by the American Academy of Microbiology
                as "the use of living organisms to reduce or eliminate environmental
                hazards resulting from accumulations of toxic chemicals and other
                hazardous wastes" (Gibson and Sayler, 1992).  "This technology is
                based on the use of naturally occurring or genetically engineered
                microorganisms (GEMS) to restore contaminated sites and protect the
                environment" (Miller and Poindexter, 1994).<p>
                Bioremediation is not a panacea but rather a "natural process"
                alternative to such methods as incineration, catalytic destruction, the use
                of adsorbents, and the physical removal and subsequent destruction of
                pollutants (AgBiotech, 1991). The cost of moving and incinerating
                pollutants is at least ten times that of <i>in situ</i> biological
                treatment (Atlas, 1995).  By integrating proper utilization of natural or
                modified microbial capabilities with appropriate engineering designs to provide
                suitable growth environments, bioremediation can be successful in the field
                (Skladany and Metting, 1992).  However, a gap exists between advances in
                laboratory research and commercial field applications (Sayler, 1995).  Two major
                factors responsible for this gap are the lack of (1) a sufficient knowledge base to
                accurately predict pollutant degradation rates and fates and (2) sites designated as
                field research centers for bioremediation research and technology demonstrations. 
                Laboratory and microcosm studies have documented the potential use of
                microorganisms for bioremediation.  However, the physiologic potential of microbial
                populations to remediate environments of relevant size, heterogeneity, and
                variability has not been adequately tested (Miller and Poindexter, 1994; Skladany
                and Metting, 1992).  Successful application of bioremediation techniques must
                address both the heterogeneous nature of many contaminated waste sites and the
                complexity of using living organisms.<p>
                There has been progress in overcoming some of the barriers that have impeded
                bioremediation from being successfully applied in the field (Atlas, 1995).  Scientists
                have begun to search for organisms with better biodegradation kinetics for a variety
                of contaminants within broad environmental habitats.  Studies examining
                extremophiles could result in using organisms <i>in situ</i>  that have a high
                tolerance for organic solvents and alkaline soils or waters, and that function at high
                temperatures for more efficient <i>ex situ </i> activity in bioreactors. <p>
                <hr><h4><i>Nine assessments have been conducted over the past four years to
                identify bioremediation R&D needs.</i></h4><hr>
                In addition, more often scientists are using molecular biology to optimize
                bioremediation.  For example, molecular engineers are constructing starvation
                promoters to express heterologous genes needed in the field for survival and adding
                additional bioremediation genes that code for enzymes able to degrade a broader
                range of compounds present in perturbed and stressed environments (Atlas, 1995). 
                Genes such as the lux gene are being inserted as monitors for specific enzyme
                activities such as naphthalene degradation.  Much of this work is being
                accomplished through transposon vectors, multimer resolution system vectors, and
                alternative nonantibiotic selection determinants such as resistance to herbicides and
                heavy metals, and nutritional markers (growth on lactose only) (de Lorenzo, 1992,
                1993).  All are efforts to make genetically modified organisms with potential for
                field bioremediation more acceptable to the general public and more predictable in
                terms of performance and ecological behavior.  However, most of this work is still
                conducted at the bench level, and technical gaps remain with respect to designing
                recombinant bacteria that are stable enough for use by process engineers in both
                <i>in situ</i> and <i>ex situ</i> applications.<p>
                Summarized below are the R&D needs expressed by academic, industrial, and
                government participants at workshops on bioremediation sponsored by universities,
                federal granting agencies, and institutions since 1991.  Essentially, the take-home
                message of all these reports is the need to better understand how bioremediation
                works in the field.  Unless there is a concerted effort to apply bench technologies for
                evaluation, implementation, and assessment in field sites containing contaminants,
                bioremediation will not reach its full potential as a proven technology.  And unless
                field engineers and bioengineers get involved in the early stages of R&D for field
                applications, bioremediation will not advance as rapidly as it should as an alternative
                to other, more costly methods.<p>
                At a workshop organized by Rutgers University in 1991, scientists and engineers
                reviewed the current state of bioremediation, addressed the difficulties in making
                bioremediation a successful applied technology, and suggested approaches for
                resolving these difficulties (AgBiotech, 1991).  Eight major problems were
                identified:<p><menu>
                1.  Bioremediation assessment and implementation need more integrated, cross-discipline effort.<p>
               2.   Initial site characterizations, due to site heterogeneity, can be inadequate to
                                    evaluate or employ bioremediation as a treatment alternative.<p>
               3.   To assess biotreatability, widely accepted methods and criteria need to be
                                    established.<p>
               4.   Factors limiting degradation rates in bioremediation applications need to be
                                    adequately identified and addressed.<p>
               5.   To ensure that bioremediation is not prematurely discarded, the full range of
                                    treatment options needs to be considered.<p>
               6.   More adequate information and enhanced modeling principles are needed for
                                    rational scale-up from the laboratory to the field.<p>
               7.   Techniques for monitoring progress and utilizing mass balance concepts in the
                                    field need to be further developed.<p>
               8.   Bioremediation needs an accessible, expanded, and well-documented
                                    database.<p></menu>
                In 1992, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a report recommending
                five key research program areas that were to provide a balanced transition of
                bioremediation research from the laboratory bench to technology applications in the
                field (BTDP, 1992).  These research program areas, listed below, could lead to a
                fundamental understanding of how to apply bioremediation technologies to
                engineering activities. <p><menu>
                1.  Improve site characterization technology.<p>
               2.   Create a "Bioremediation Field Initiative" to expand field experiments and
                                    collect and disseminate bioremediation performance data.<p>
               3.   Develop new approaches to performance evaluation in order to better
                                    determine the extent and rate of cleanup.<p>
               4.   Research processes to identify microbial capability of biotransformation and
                                    develop methods for delivery.<p>
               5.   Develop better models of bioremediation through exploitation of field results
                                    to predict and guide future applications.<p></menu>
                <hr><h4><i>&quotThere is a need to orient aspects of bioremediation research to
                modern biotechnologically integrated science and engineering efforts using field site
                demonstrations as vehicles for integration.&quot</i> (Gibson and Sayler,
                1992)</h4><hr>
                
                The American Academy of Microbiology in 1992 evaluated the scientific
                foundations of bioremediation, its current status, and its future needs (Gibson and
                Sayler, 1992).  The workshop panelists concluded that solid biochemical, molecular,
                and ecological foundations of bioremediation existed and that environmental
                biotechnology has expanded the knowledge base of on-going processes with
                bioremediation.  The report lists examples of bioremediation process performance
                and credibility, such as land farming and soil slurry reactors.  It addresses concerns
                regarding information needs to advance current technology, parameters for
                successful bioremediation (site characterization, biodegradability of the
                contaminants, microbiology, and environmental and nutritional factors) that should
                be included in the engineering framework, and limitations of current knowledge. 
                There are opportunities for enhanced technology if improvements can be made in
                process performance, degradative capacity via molecular engineering, predicting the
                outcome of multicomponent substrate biodegradation, and understanding the
                regulation of microbial enzyme production for simultaneous degradation of several
                compounds that are all present at low concentrations.  Bioremediation can be
                developed as a technology if the exploratory research base is exploited.  There is a
                need to better understand and define the following: the roles and applications of
                microbial biofilms and activities at interfaces, the microbial responses to
                multipollutant mixtures, the dynamics of microbial community structure and
                function, site characterization, process monitoring and optimization, and integration
                of molecular genetics and physiology with environmental needs.  The report also
                recommends that kinetic models be developed and coupled to existing and emerging
                hydrogeochemical transport models to predict the potential success of
                bioremediation and that this technology be evaluated and verified in the field. 
                Finally, the report concludes that there is a lack of well-characterized field sites that
                could be used for understanding the natural events that occur and for demonstrating
                feasibility of the laboratory-demonstrated technology.  Only under environmental
                conditions and by using an interdisciplinary approach can bioremediation be applied
                and verified.<p>
                In 1993, the American Academy for Microbiology held a follow-up workshop to the
                1992 workshop.  The resulting report documented the critical need for field research
                in environmental bioremediation by addressing strategies and mechanisms for field
                research in environmental bioremediation (Miller and Poindexter, 1994).  Criteria
                for field site selection and use are described, as well as use of components of
                scientific disciplines in conducting field research in environmental bioremediation. 
                The report recaps some of the technologies already developed that have applications
                for field use, such as physical and chemical analysis and microbiological and genetic
                methods.  Now, concludes the report, is the time for bioremediation to move into
                field sites, where the necessary information can be obtained to predict efficacy and
                determine the duration of treatment, costs, and safety.<p>
                The National Research Council's 1993 report "In Situ Bioremediation:  When Does
                It Work?" discusses the future prospects for bioremediation and three limiting
                factors that restrict the use of field applications of the variety of microbial processes
                well documented in the laboratory (CISB, 1993).  These factors are the lack of
                understanding of how microorganisms behave in the field, the difficulties associated
                with stimulating microbial growth in the field, and making the contaminant
                bioavailable to the microbial community.  To overcome these limitations, it was
                recommended that research focus on the following:<p><menu>
                1.  Understand microbial processes in nature, such as anaerobic versus aerobic
                                    reactions, and how they are interrelated within a microniche.<p>
               2.   Examine the effect of stimulating materials for increased microbial growth
                                    such as gas sparging.<p>
               3.   Promote more efficient contact between the contaminant and the
                                    microorganism through high-pressure fracturing of the subsurface matrix or
                                    solubilization of the contaminants via steam injection, addition of surfactants,
                                    or through improved dispersal methods.<p>
               4.   Evaluate protocols for the range of chemical contaminants and site
                                    characteristics in the field and document the loss of these contaminants from
                                    the field.<p>
               5.   Develop innovative site characterization techniques that are rapid, reliable, and
                                    inexpensive.<p>
               6.   Improve mathematical models to link the understanding of chemical, physical,
                                    and biological activities occurring in the field.<p>
               7.   Demonstrate that bioremediation is working in the field at fast-enough rates
                                    and in multiple locations to ensure that cleanup goals are met.<p></menu>
                The American Chemical Society sponsored a symposium entitled "Bioremediation
                through Rhizosphere Technology" in 1993.  The published papers from this
                symposium indicate that the rhizosphere provides a complex and dynamic
                microenvironment where bacteria and fungi associated with plant roots can degrade,
                mineralize, and stabilize toxicants, thus offering a potentially important treatment
                strategy for bioremediation of numerous classes of hazardous chemicals in the
                environment (Anderson and Coats, 1994).  Radionuclides and heavy metals were not
                discussed.  However, the recommendations of the participants indicate that an
                understanding of the fundamental biochemical, physiological, and ecological
                interactions in the rhizosphere will facilitate the successful use of vegetation to
                remediate chemically contaminated soils.<p>
                In 1994, the Department of Energy held a workshop to discuss the current status and
                the basic and applied research needs of phytoremediation (DOE, 1994b). 
                Phytoremediation uses the natural attributes of plants for applications in site
                remediation efforts.  Useful attributes of plants include their roots, which have
                enormous surface area to bioaccumulate and concentrate contaminants such as heavy
                metals and other inorganic compounds, and their diverse genetic adaptations to
                handle toxic levels of contaminants and mineralize toxic organic compounds.  In
                addition, there is a positive synergy between microorganisms in the rhizosphere, in
                that the numbers and activities of microorganisms are increased due to the nutrient
                and energy sources provided by the plant.  In many instances these microbial
                activities are bioremedial.  Overall, plant cultivation and management is cost-effective and in many ways more easily accepted by the general public, since it is a
                solar energy driven process.  Even though phytoremediation is considered a viable
                technology for some contaminants, certain research and development needs
                exist:<p><menu>
                1.  To better understand and utilize the physiological, biochemical, and genetic
                                    mechanisms of uptake, transport, and accumulation of pollutants. <p>
               2.   To genetically evaluate those plants that are hyperaccumulators of metals and
                                    other pollutants.<p>
               3.   To better understand the interactions occurring in the rhizosphere between the
                                    plant root system and surrounding biota.<p>
               4.   To implement field evaluations and validation of phytoremediation
                                    technologies.<p></menu>
                A workshop held by the European Community and the U.S. government in 1994
                focused on the potential of microorganisms to solve environmental problems
                (Economidis and Palmisano, 1995).  Three areas of research were discussed: 
                anaerobic biotransformations of pollutants, biodegradability testing using
                microcosm and mesocosm approaches, and tailor-made microorganisms for the
                treatment of toxic waste.  The participants concluded that future research on the use
                of microorganisms to solve environmental problems should focus on the need
                to:<p><menu>
                1.  Examine bioremedial catalytic systems of microorganisms that have not
                                    previously been well studied.<p>
               2.   Focus on the diverse metabolic pathways exhibited by microorganisms when
                                    grown in the absence of oxygen.<p>
               3.   Explore use of combined aerobic/anaerobic or anaerobic/aerobic systems for
                                    biodegradation of pollutants.<p>
               4.   Assess the bioavailability of contaminants and catalysis in the nonaqueous
                                    phase of contaminant biotransformation in multiple-phase systems.<p>
               5.   Develop biological-based methods for the containment, control, and
                                    monitoring of microbial populations in reactors and field sites.<p>
               6.   Further explore inoculation for bioremediation in contained and uncontained
                                    systems.<p></menu>
                <hr><h4><i>The take-home message of all these reports is the need to better

                In 1995, the National Science and Technology Council's Biotechnology
                Research Subcommittee reported that several priorities for research in
                bioremediation are needed to further advance the field (BRS, 1995). 
                These priorities are:<p><menu>
                1.  Develop an understanding of the structure of microbial
                                    communities and their dynamics in response to normal
                                    environmental variation and novel anthropogenic stresses.<p>
               2.   Develop an understanding of the biochemical mechanisms,
                                    including enzymatic pathways, involved in aerobic and particularly
                                    anaerobic degradation of pollutants.<p>
               3.   Extend the understanding of microbial genetics as a basis for
                                    enhancing the capabilities of microorganisms to degrade
                                    pollutants.<p>
               4.   As a standard practice, conduct microcosm/mesocosm studies of
                                    new bioremediation techniques to determine, in a cost-effective
                                    manner, whether they are likely to work in the field, and establish
                                    dedicated sites where long-term field research on bioremediation
                                    technologies may be conducted.<p>
               5.   Develop, test, and evaluate innovative biotechnologies, such as biosensors, for
                                    monitoring bioremediation <i>in situ </i>; models for the biological
                                    processes at work in bioremediation; and reliable, uniform methods for
                                    assessing the efficacy of bioremediation technologies.<p></menu>
                Over a ten-year period, NABIR will address most if not all of the research and
                development needs compiled over five years by international scientists and engineers
                working in the bioremediation field.  In reports written since 1991 on the research
                needs for bioremediation, all agree that the real question that needs to be answered
                is whether or not <i>in situ </i> bioremediation can be an efficient, cost-effective
                technology.  There is a growing body of evidence that various bioremediation
                processes can often provide a clean, natural, and cost-effective method for treatment
                of pollutants (Atlas, 1995).  Yet bioremediation is described as an innovative but
                unproven technology and is often not even considered as an alternative technology
                by field engineers (Grimes, 1995; Sayler, 1995).  One way to answer this question
                of feasibility is to provide a systematic long-term integrated program of field
                research focused on testing and optimizing the potential of bioremediation as a
                major environmental technology for recovery of contaminated sites, and assessing
                its safety.  The following pages describe such a program.<p>
