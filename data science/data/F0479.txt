    statusbar panels can be sized like splitter windows</strong><br>
    <br>
    Ever wanted to use a statusbar (a real one, VB's, or even the CCRP Statusbar) and didn't
    have enough horizontal window real estate to display the status text? Well, here's a new
    solution, allow each panel of the statusbar to be sized just like it had its very own
    vertical splitter bar...<br>
    <br>
    What we do in the demo is first subclass the target statusbar, allowing us to receive and
    respond to its mouse messages. The coordinates of the all of the statusbar's vertical
    panel dividers are then obtained. When the WM_SETCURSOR window message is received and the
    mouse crosses over one of the panel dividers, the mouse pointer is changed to the
    horizontal sizing cursor (&quot;&lt;---&gt;&quot;). When the subclassing procedure
    receives the WM_LBUTTONDOWN message and subsequent WM_MOUSEMOVE messages, the panels on
    either side of the divider the mouse is over are continually resized with the statusbar's
    SB_SETPARTS message. Panel sizing is completed on receipt of the WM_LBUTTONUP message.<br>
    <br>
    And we went the whole nine on this one, and implemented the code as an COM server (ActiveX
    DLL). The project's code can either be compiled into a DLL, or added directly to a
    project.<br>
    <br>
    To aid in VB IDE subclassing development, the &quot;Debug Object for AddressOf
    Subclassing&quot; (Dbgwproc.dll) found at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/downloads/controls.asp">VB owner's area</a> on the
    MS web site is used by the project and is included in the zip. The DLL must be registered
    and referenced by the project for things to work correctly.<br>
