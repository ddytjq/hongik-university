    <td width="100%" align="left" colspan="2"><font face="Arial" color="#004000">The latest
    animated release from Dreamworks (whose earlier movies include Shrek and Chicken Run) is
    Spirit: The Stallion of the Cimarron. This is a movie for horse lovers of all ages due for
    release in time for the upcoming school holidays on June 27 (June 20 Qld).</font><p><img src="spirit3501.jpg" alt="spirit3501.jpg (15438 bytes)" border="2" align="right" hspace="10" WIDTH="350" HEIGHT="163"><font face="Arial" color="#004000">The movie opens following an eagle as it
    glides through the canyons of Spirit&#146;s homeland then zooms in on a mare in the long
    grass. Soon the audience is introduced to a colt foal who see the world as his playground
    and spends his early days frolicking with the herd. As Spirit becomes older he becomes the
    leader of the herd protecting them from all dangers but one evening there is a glow in the
    distance. Spirit chooses to investigate this strange light and happens upon the campsite
    of a small group of travellers. Spirit races off to escape but is eventually captured and
    taken away from his picturesque homeland to the barren plains of the army fort. Here he
    meets the Cavalry Colonel who is intent on breaking the wild mustang something Spirit
    attempts to fight. While Spirit is at the fort a young brave named Little Creek is also
    captured and the two form a friendship through necessity as both struggle to escape their
    captors. Through Little Creek Spirit meets Rain a beautiful paint mare and his heart is
    divided on his future until circumstances make decisions for him as he must continue to
    fight for his freedom.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#004000">The soundtrack is a key part of this film with Han
    Zimmer composing the music and Bryan Adams writing and performing the songs. Previously
    Hans Zimmer has worked on the animated features The Lion King (for which he won an Academy
    Award), The Prince of Egypt and The Road to El Dorado plus the feature films Gladiator,
    Black Hawk Down, Mission Impossible 2, The Rock, Backdraft, Days of Thunder, Green Card,
    Cool </font></p>
    <p><img src="spirit3502.jpg" alt="spirit3502.jpg (22489 bytes)" align="right" border="2" hspace="10" WIDTH="350" HEIGHT="235"><font face="Arial" color="#004000">Bryan Adams has been producing chart
    topping hits since the early 80s with songs such as Summer of 69, Heaven, Run to You, etc
    and has sold over 60 million albums worldwide. He has been involved in movie soundtracks
    since the early 1990s when he produced (Everything I Do) I Do It For You from the Robin
    Hood: Prince of Thieves soundtrack. This song earned an Academy Award and Golden Globe
    nominations plus a Grammy Award and is the record holder for the longest running No. 1
    single in British history. Bryan Adams then received Academy Award nominations for Have
    You Ever Really Loved a Woman (from the Don Juan De Marco starring Johnny Depp) and
    I&#146;ve Finally Someone a duet with Barbara Streisand (from The Mirror Has Two Faces).
    Other songs include All For Love (with Rod Stewart and Sting) from the Three Musketeers
    and the main theme song from the Robin Williams movie Jack. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#004000">The first song to appear is &#145;Here I Am&#146;
    which accompanies Spirit as a foal as he revels in his freedom and his homeland. &#145;You
    Can&#146;t Take Me&#146; encompasses Spirit&#146;s resolve to fight his captors and then
    &#145;Get Off My Back&#146; is his response to the soldiers trying to break him in.
    &#145;Sound the Bugle&#146; involves one of the saddest parts of the movie when it appears
    all hope is gone while &#145;I Will Always Return&#146; serves as the main theme of the
    movie. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#004000">Apart from the voice of Bryan Adams the only human
    &#145;cast&#146; members are Matt Damon who narrates the movie as the voice or more the
    thoughts of Spirit with James Cromwell as the Colonel and Daniel Studi as Little Creek. </font></p>
    <p><img src="spirit3503.jpg" alt="spirit3503.jpg (10647 bytes)" border="2" align="right" hspace="10" WIDTH="350" HEIGHT="165"><font face="Arial" color="#004000">Matt Damon came to prominence with his work
    with Ben Affleck writing the screenplay and the main lead characters in the movie Good
    Will Hunting which won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Matt Damon then went
    on to star in The Talented Mr Ripley, Courage Under Fire, The Rainmaker, Saving Private
    Ryan, Ocean&#146;s Eleven and will be seen in the upcoming spy feature The Bourne
    Identity.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#004000">James Cromwell is best known for his Academy Award
    nominated roll in Babe but has also appeared in Star Trek: First Contact, Babe 2, Space
    Cowboys and will be seen next as the President of the United States in The Sum of All
    Fears.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#004000">Daniel Studi is the son of the famous Native Indian
    actor Wes Studi and has appeared alongside his father in the TV movie Crazy Horse. Well
    known as a stage actor this is one of Daniel Studi&#146;s first forays into motion
    pictures</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#004000">Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is the first
    animated feature movie to have a horse as the main character. One of the main reasons why
    is put down to the fact that horses are extremely difficult for animators to draw. The
    animators spent months learning about the movement, anatomy and behaviour of horses. They
    worked with Dr Deb Bennett and Dr Stuart Sumida plus the Los Angeles Equestrian Centre
    learning by working with skeletons and observing real life horses. Producers acquired a
    buckskin Kiger mustang stallion to serve as the real life Spirit for the main character to
    be based on. The Kiger mustang dates back to the early Spanish breeds brought with
    settlers to the US from Europe. Due to the limitations of horses animators<br>
    used creative licence to add eyebrows and &#145;human like&#146; eyes to convey emotion as
    the characters don&#146;t talk. </font></p>
    <p><img src="spirit3505.jpg" alt="spirit3505.jpg (13935 bytes)" align="right" border="2" hspace="10" WIDTH="350" HEIGHT="213"><font face="Arial" color="#004000">The decision not to have the characters
    talk was made early in production as it was thought that the story wouldn&#146;t be taken
    seriously. The horses do neigh, whinny and make other horse sounds (which were recorded in
    stables) throughout the movie where appropriate and great care was taken to make sure the
    &#145;right&#146; sounds were used.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#004000">This is also the first animated feature to be done
    in a widescreen format Cinemascope which allowed animators an extra 40%&nbsp; of screen
    space to add in more imagery with a greater resolution. The backgrounds are based on
    numerous US national parks that the animators visited in a whirlwind 8 days. The three
    minute opening montage shows many of the landscapes seen at various times later in the
    film. The techniques to animate this movie are also new combining the traditional hand
    drawn images with those created via computers. Producer Jeffrey Katzenberg said
    &#147;There is nothing that takes the place of what happens when an animator gives life to
    a character with a paper onto a piece of paper&#148; however the difference where the
    action changes between the two techniques is seamless throughout and produces a superior
    end product. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#004000">Overall this movie is for anyone who enjoys a good
    story and horse people of all ages should enjoy the tale. The soundtrack is brilliant and
    compliments the on screen action perfectly in assisting to tell the story. The animators
    have done a fantastic job and have got the movements, actions and horse emotions as close
    as could be done in an animated film. Make the time to see this movie it is well worth the
    effort.</font></p>
