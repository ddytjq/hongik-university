        face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="2"><br>
        <br>
        LOS ANGELES, Jul 10, 2002 (Xinhua via COMTEX) -- In a study released Wednesday in the
        online edition of the scientific journal Nature, researchers at three institutions
        describe the identification of a specific susceptibility gene linked to asthma. <br>
        <br>
        The gene is known as ADAM33, a member of the protease sub- family known as
        metalloproteases. It was identified through genetic screening of a large number of
        families from the United States and the United Kingdom. <br>
        <br>
        According to Genome Therapeutics, a biopharmaceutical company that involved in the study,
        researchers amassed clinical information and biological samples from over 450 families
        that suffered from the disease. Using the samples obtained, the company employed its
        proprietary disease-specific gene identification platform to identify candidate genes
        linked to an increased likelihood of suffering from asthma. The other two institutions in
        the study are the University of Southampton in the UK and research- based company
        Schering-Plough. <br>
        <br>
        The researchers found that rather than the allergic and immunological components that
        contribute to asthma, genetic analyses suggest that ADAM33 is involved in the generation
        of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR). The association of this gene with BHR and possible
        links with airway remodeling offers new avenues of research into the underlying causes of
        asthma. <br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, discovery of susceptibility genes for asthma offers the possibility in the
        future of identifying those individuals who are predisposed to asthma and initiating
        therapy early to prevent or ameliorate the disease process before permanent changes occur.
        <br>
        <br>
        Asthma affects an estimated 14.9 million people in the United States and direct economic
        and health care costs associated with the disease are nearly 14.5 billion US dollars per
        year, according to Genome Therapeutics. In the United Kingdom, an estimated 5.1 million --
        1 in 8 children and 1 in 13 adults -- are currently being treated for the disease.<br>

        </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="3">Genetic Test Detects HIV Within Weeks</font></strong><font
        face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="2"><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        HIV infection can be detected earlier and more thoroughly through widespread genetic
        screening and the pooling of blood samples, according to US research. <br>
        <br>
        At present, standard antibody tests can fail to detect infection for up to six months and
        may return a wrong result. <br>
        <br>
        But by pooling blood samples from people being screened for HIV, and testing for RNA - the
        genetic material of viruses - it is possible to pick up infections just a few weeks old,
        the research found. <br>
        <br>
        ``The acute stage of the infection is almost never diagnosed in clinical practice and is
        always missed by routine antibody tests,'' said Dr Christopher Pilcher from the University
        of North Carolina. <br>
        <br>
        The research comes amid news yesterday that Victoria's rate of HIV had leapt over the past
        two years after a decline through the 1990s, prompting warnings from the country's AIDS
        experts. <br>
        <br>
        Dr Pilcher said detection in weeks rather than months would allow anti-retroviral
        treatment to begin sooner and stop HIV from spreading. <br>
        <br>
        ``If we can catch infected people during the first weeks when antibody tests are still
        negative, we can help them avoid spreading HIV to their husbands, wives, unborn children
        or other intimate partners,'' he said. <br>
        <br>
        People infected with HIV can pass on the virus within a few weeks of being infected. <br>
        <br>
        HIV tests designed to detect the virus' RNA - rather than antibodies to it - are already
        available. But they are too time-consuming and expensive to be used in standard HIV
        screening, says the team. <br>
        <br>
        However, a pooling technique, combining samples of antibody-negative blood, gets around
        this problem. First, pools of blood from 10 people are created. Then, portions of these
        pools are drawn and combined to make pools of 90. <br>
        <br>
        By testing the large pools and then, if necessary, the small ones, lab staff can quickly
        eliminate large numbers of HIV-negative people. If one smaller pool contains the virus,
        each of the original 10 samples is then tested individually. <br>
        <br>
        The study, published in New Scientist, involved over 8000 people who visited HIV testing
        sites in North Carolina in 2001. <br>
        <br>
        Standard antibody tests revealed that 39 had long-term HIV infection. Then, using blood
        pooling and RNA analysis, the team identified four people with early HIV infection among
        those with negative antibody results. <br>
        <br>
        ``One important thing we proved with this new work was that a significant number of
        contagious infections are being missed by routine antibody testing,'' said Dr Pilcher. <br>

        which would be available through peer-reviewed application, to every country. It argues

        medicine. "The report anticipates how the global community could use genetics to

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" size="2">Researchers are mapping the genomes of some

        nations, although Brazil, China, India and Cuba are notable exceptions. These achievements

        resulting in the so-called 'digital divide,'" said Professor Dan Brock of Brown
        University, another of the report's writers. "Genomics and related technologies
        should be used to narrow the existing unethical inequities in global health. The report is
        an important first step towards this goal."<br>
        <br>
        "The whole thrust of the report is that we will not change medical practice overnight
        by this new technology," Weatherall said. "However, the long-term possibilities
        are such that developing countries, as well as developed countries, must prepare
        themselves for this new technology and carefully explore its possibilities."<br>
        <br>
        DNA research is under way on a number of projects that can improve health care in
        developing countries, with some projects already yielding results. Among the research
        mentioned in the report are:<br>
        <br>
        Creating a new designer mosquito that cannot carry the malaria parasite, one of the
        biggest killers in the developing world. <br>
        Rapid identification of a class of antimalarial drugs that have the potential to be
        effective against multidrug-resistant parasites, as well as being inexpensive and stable.
        A combination of malaria parasite DNA sequencing, bioinformatics (use of computer
        technology to store, analyze and interpret biological data), and data mining (searching
        for comparative genomic data) have been instrumental in the creation of these drugs. <br>
        Two new types of vaccines derived from genetic research have been developed against
        tuberculosis, which is spreading in both developing and developed countries. Clinical
        trials of one of these vaccines has already started. <br>
        The diagnosis of leishmaniasis and dengue fever, both pandemic in some Latin American
        countries, has already been improved by the use of polymerase chain reaction techniques -
        one of the basic techniques in DNA research. <br>
        Cuba has developed a meningitis B vaccine at the Carlos J. Finlay Institute, attesting to
        the potential of biotechnology in developing countries. <br>
        Clinical trials have begun in Nairobi, Kenya and Oxford, UK, of a DNA-based AIDS vaccine
        candidate designed specifically for Africa. <br>
