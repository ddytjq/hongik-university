<h1>Late pass gives Andretti second straight win</h1>

DETROIT -- Experience and reflexes helped Michael Andretti to his second straight victory as he took the rain-marred IndyCar Detroit Grand Prix on Sunday at Belle Isle Park.<p>

Andretti passed youthful teammate Christian Fittipaldi of
Brazil on a restart with six laps left and recorded his third win of
the season.  Fittipaldi snatched the lead early, and held it
until Andretti finally overtook him on a restart following
a crash by Bobby Rahal. Last week at Milwaukee, Andretti passed Al Unser Jr., another of several drivers to crash Sunday on the
wet track.
<p> 

	   With the two-hour time limit allotted to the race
running out, Andretti feinted outside, then drove hard to the
inside. He steered his Ford-powered Lola past Fittipaldi's on lap
66 of what turned out to be a shortened, 72-lap event. It had been scheduled for 77 laps.<p>

	   Fittipaldi had a lead of almost 3 seconds before the caution
flag that set up the decisive restart.<p>
	   &quot;Poor Christian,&quot; Andretti said. &quot;He got a little wide and I
was there.<p>
&quot;I was going to try to really stay on him for one or two laps
because we were both on cold tires.  I
figured that was the only chance I was going to get.  I noticed he went wide and I jumped on the throttle. I was
just lucky. I took advantage of a mistake. I really feel bad for
Christian.&quot;<p>
	   The win was the 33rd for Andretti, 33, who leads
active Indy-car drivers in victories.<p>
	   &quot;There's not a lot to say,&quot; Fittipaldi said. &quot;Mike has won
the most Indy-car races of anybody out here. He put a lot of
pressure on me and I braked a little late.&quot;<p>
	   The 25-year-old Brazilian, still seeking his first Indy-car
victory, finished six car-lengths behind. He was followed on
by Gil de Ferran, Adrian Fernandez and Mark Blundell.<p>
	   Intermittent, heavy rain was the cause of some problems, with Goodyear's
grooved rain tires considerably better than those offered by
Firestone, which returned to the Indy-car series in 1995 after
a 21-year absence.<p>
	   &quot;These (rain) tires have not been utilized due to lack of
inclement weather,&quot; Firestone said in a released statement. &quot;We do
know work is needed in this area and we have been developing a new
wet tire which will be introduced in the near future.&quot;<p>
	   Most of the drivers were able to stay out of trouble on the
slick surface in the early going, but defending race winner Robby
Gordon brought out the first caution flag when he locked up his
brakes and slid into a tire barrier on lap 4.<p>
	   The next incident came on lap 23 when rookie Greg Moore tried to
pass front-row starter Andre Ribeiro, who had slipped back into the
pack on his Firestones. Moore got into the wet part of the track
and spun into a tire wall, barely missing Ribeiro, who also spun
and briefly stalled his car.<p>
	   As the rain stopped falling and the race continued, the racing
groove on the track dried. All of the leaders switched to the
normal slick tires when the first round of pit stops came on lap 24
during the caution period.<p>
	   That didn't change anything significantly, with Fittipaldi
continuing to dominate the race, easily holding runner-up Andretti
at bay at that point.<p>
	   Jimmy Vasser, who came into the race with a 22-point lead over
Unser in the season standings, started 20th and never got into
contention. He finished a lap down in 12th, earning one point. That
actually increased his lead by one, 98-75, thanks to Unser's
misfortune in sliding into a tire barrier on lap 47 while trying to
pass teammate Tracy for fifth place.<p>
	   Rahal, a three-time series champion, also found a tire wall on
lap 62 after he had worked himself all the way to fourth place.
Ribeiro and Emerson Fittipaldi, another Goodyear driver, both were
knocked out of the event when they glanced hard off concrete
barriers in separate incidents.<p>
	   On the same lap in which Andretti passed Christian Fittipaldi
for the lead, Tracy also slid hard into a tire wall, ending his
race day while running fourth.<p>
	   The race was restarted on lap 68 and one lap later, Pruett,
running fourth, slid backward into the tires, bringing out the
sixth caution flag. Pruett was able to continue and salvaged a
10th-place finish.<p>
