        <p>It is well known that basketball shooting is a deteriorating art in this 
        country.&nbsp; Million dollar athletes in the NBA and star college and
        high school players miss open jumpers with great regularity and often fail 
        miserably at the free throw line.&nbsp; Shaq O'Neal, the multi-million
        dollar L.A. Laker Star, is shooting less than 50% from the free throw line.



        <p>Stories abound about the dilemma.&nbsp; Coaches don't know what to do.&nbsp;
        An article called &quot;Why can't Johnny make a jump shot?&quot; in the San
        Francisco Chronicle* last year said that the three point percentage in college has
        fallen every year since its inception 10 years previously. To miss
        easy jump shots is so common that it's not considered out of the ordinary.
        Seventy Percent for free throws is considered quite good. Teams
        often shoot only 30-40% for a game, and that includes all the lay-ups and dunks!</p>
        <p>
        Europeans and players from other countries shoot better than Americans. As they get 
        their athletic skills up to the level of our athletes, we're
        going to start losing to them because we can't shoot the outside shot. An Olympic 
        medal will not be a sure thing very much longer.</p>
        
        <p><b>I. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?</b>
        <p>
        What is the problem?&nbsp; What can be done about it?&nbsp; The article
        mentioned above lists 7 reasons for the poor shooting:



        <p><i>It's not cool</i><br>
        Swooping dunks are what guys want to achieve.&nbsp; They want to look
        like Dr. J or Michael Jordan.&nbsp; The highlight films on TV are mostly
        about slamming the ball down over an opponent, not about deft passing and a
        smooth outside jumper.



        <p><i>Wrong guys shooting the ball</i><br>
        It used to be that only the better shooters shot the long outside shots,
        the perimeter shots.&nbsp; Now, because of the 3 point shot, everyone
        wants to put them up and be a hero.



        <p><i>Power game</i><br>
        The game has become a lot more physical.&nbsp; Athleticism at all levels
        is revered at the expense of skills.&nbsp; Speed, quickness and jumping
        ability are favored more than good fundamentals or a great shooting touch.



        <p><i>The rise of AAU programs</i><br>
        Kids used to learn basketball on the playgrounds, playing for hours, including lots of time to practice shooting.&nbsp; Now with AAU programs
        and endless structured tournaments, a lot more emphasis is on playing games
        rather than practice.



        <p><i>Poor technique</i><br>
        Europeans learn to shoot the right way, perhaps from some text book. They're encouraged to practice shooting and learn good form.&nbsp;
        Americans often learn it by watching TV and picking up bad habits.&nbsp; Going for
        the 3 point shot too early and too often can wreck a shooting style.



        <p><i>Poor facilities</i><br>
        Another old line is that kids from inner cities don't shoot particularly
        well because they grow up on playgrounds, places where there are bent rims without nets, 
        places not conducive to breeding shooters.&nbsp; To
        learn a reliable shot takes repetition and hours of practice.&nbsp; These days
        there are too many kids and too few courts.



        <p><i>Better defenses</i><br>
        This is certainly one of the major reasons.&nbsp; The in-your-face
        physical pressure initiated by Georgetown in the early 80's probably started
        this.&nbsp; Defense is a statement, and it's tougher than ever to get an
        open jump shot.</p>
        <p>
        These are valid reasons, and they explain some of the problem.&nbsp; But
        how can you explain top players missing open 10-15' jump shots and, even 
        more confounding, free throws?&nbsp; The free throw is an easy shot ?
        15' to the backboard, only 13' 9&quot; to dead center.&nbsp; There's no rush.&nbsp;
        No one is &quot;in their face.&quot;&nbsp; It's not a difficult shot, as evidenced
        by a few non-playing people, some in their 60's and 70's, setting records making
        thousands in a row.</p>
        <p>
        In this article, first of a series, I'd like to suggest two more reasons
        for the problem and offer some ideas that might help.



        <p><i>It's thought it takes a long time to learn</i><br>
        First, I believe it is thought it takes hundreds and hundreds of hours to learn 
        how to shoot well. You have to develop a great stroke and
        then practice from this spot and that spot and that spot every day. 
        With today's attention spans, kids don't focus well on anything very long,
        and if they think it's going to take forever to learn something, why try? 
        Besides it's more fun to work on your spin moves and jamming.
        Shooting practice is looked on like drudgery.



        <p><i>Coaches don't know how to coach shooting</i><br>
        And secondly, and most importantly, I feel there is a problem with the coaching of 
        shooting. Most coaches were not great shooters
        themselves, and it's difficult to coach something you can't do yourself well. 
        What happens is they coach shooting by focusing on the so-called 
        &quot;Fundamentals&quot; of shooting. That way they can't be
        faulted for not coaching the skill. However, the Fundamentals - how to hold the
        ball, how to stand, where to look, how to bring the ball up to the Set Point,
        and the Release and Follow Through - are only the beginning, a stepping off point. 
        But coaching usually stops there, urging the players to
        &quot;go out and practice&quot; and thus, figure out themselves how to put the
        ball into the basket consistently. Most never figure it out.</p>
        
        <p><b>II. SOME ADVICE ON HOW TO IMPROVE SHOOTING</b></p>
        <p>First I want to offer that shooting well is not that difficult and that it can be 
        learned in a fraction of the amount of time normally thought!
        The truth about most physical actions, in my opinion, is that we greatly
        over complicate them.&nbsp; The most efficient, accurate and powerful athletic 
        movements are the essence of
        simplicity, be it golf, tennis, bowling, Tai Chi or basketball shooting as examples. 
        The basketball shot
        has evolved for most players into a throwing motion coming mostly from the upper body. 
        Arms, wrists, hands and fingers are employed to
        power and guide the shot, thus creating a flat arch (30° above horizontal at 
        best) and a ball flight controlled by small muscles.



        <p>Watch yourself or others shoot.&nbsp; Most shots get only 1-2 feet above
        the basket at the highest point.&nbsp; The shots are coming in
        &quot;hot&quot; and flat, around 20-30% above horizontal.&nbsp; How often do you see one that
        rises higher than the top of the backboard.&nbsp; If you do, it's probably
        coming from the best shooter on the court.&nbsp; Shooting high does two major
        things:&nbsp; (1) it creates a larger landing area for the ball, and (2)
        it softens the shot as gravity has more time to slow it down as it rises.



        <p>From my research, a shot coming into the basket at a medium high angle of ~45° 
        above horizontal has an effective landing area about 60% larger
        than for a shot coming in at ~30°.&nbsp; An even higher 60° angle shot
        (the angle considered most effective by some coaches) has a landing area more
        than twice as large than that of a 30° angle shot. A larger
        landing area and a softer shot have to lead to greater success ... why wouldn't
        players want to shoot higher to get these benefits?



        <p>The problem is that most players can't shoot very high with the muscle action they use.
         Arm, wrist, hand and finger actions are
        horizontal motions.&nbsp; They create a flat arch.&nbsp; To get higher arch, the
        players must use more body/leg action.



        <p>Here's a suggestion:&nbsp; (This instruction is written for coaches, but
        if you're a player, do it on yourself.) Have your players jump up and
        down without a ball (with eyes closed, too) and notice what it feels like.
        Ask them what direction the force is.  They will answer it's
        &quot;upward.&quot; They will also notice it's a strong, stable action.&nbsp; I call that
        motion the UpForceT, but you could call it anything you want ? leg power, lift,
        body/leg action, etc.&nbsp; Ask your players then to shoot and notice if 
        there is any of that force in their shot.&nbsp; Is any shot power coming
        from the lower body, or is it all (or mostly) from the upper body
        &quot;Release&quot; muscles?



        <p>As they start to feel and discriminate more and less UpForceT, ask them to tell you what percent of available U/F energy is being used with each
        shot (it will vary).&nbsp; By percent, I don't mean to jump stronger to
        get a higher number.&nbsp; I mean what percent of what's there is utilized.&nbsp;
        A little down &amp; up free throw action can be used 100%.&nbsp; From my
        perspective, the higher the percent, the greater the chance of the ball going in.



        <p>You will discover that the more body/leg action in the shot, the higher,
        quicker, the more stable the shot.&nbsp; And there will be more power
        and range.&nbsp; This one distinction, using more body/leg power in the
        shot, can make a huge difference in shooting proficiency.
