<H2><B>Sequence homology search tools</B></H2>

<H2><B>on the world wide web</B></H2>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Introduction </B></P>

<P>Sequence homology search tools may be divided into four groups,
illustrated in Figure 1.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>1. <B>Pairwise searches </B>(<I>e.g.</I>, BLAST, Smith-Waterman)
These programs compare a single query sequence against each sequence
in a (large) database and report significant similarities</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>2. <B>Profile searches </B>(<I>e.g.</I>, HMMER) These programs, if
supplied with several examples of a family of sequences, will attempt
to construct a profile of this family, then search a database for
sequences that fit the profile</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>3. <B>Automated searches</B> (<I>e.g.</I>, PSI-BLAST) These
programs first seek out close relatives of a single query sequence,
then use these close relatives to build a profile. In other words,
they combine the tasks performed by pairwise and profile search
tools</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>4. <B>Protein family databases</B> (<I>e.g.</I>, PFAM, PROSITE,
BLOCKS) Here, a single query sequence is compared to entries in a
database of profiles, each representing a distinct protein family.
This approach shares many of the benefits of profile searches,
without the duplicated effort of finding members of an already
well-characterised family</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Each method has its advantages. Automated tools take a lot of the
pain out of homology searching, but may return spurious results.
Protein family databases bring greater reliability at little extra
cost but may miss some homologies. Profile searches are best for
investigators who have the time to carefully curate their query
alignment. Pairwise searches arguably remain the most transparent
(and fastest) of methods.</P>

<P>This article briefly discusses the main examples of each type of
search program, outlining relevant issues and giving links to
websites where available. Slightly more detail is given for more
recent tools such as PSI-BLAST, where commentary is less readily
available. Unless otherwise indicated, all programs may be used to
search for both DNA-to-DNA and protein-to-protein homologies. At the
end of the article, a short section outlining promising developments
in automated profiling is included.</P>

<P>This is not intended to be a complete tutorial on sequence
homology searching; for that, see <I>e.g.</I>, &#91;1&#93; for an
introduction or &#91;2&#93; for a more technical treatment. It should
also be noted that links can go out of date quickly; often a
judiciously worded web search is the easiest way to find the service
required.</P>

<P><B>Note regarding algorithms and implementations</B>. Often, the
methodology that a program uses (the underlying algorithm) is shared
by more than one program. Recommending one among several
implementations of an algorithm can be controversial but it has been
attempted here in the interests of clarity.<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->

tools.</I></H6>

<P><B>Pairwise searches </B></P>

<P>In a pairwise search, a query sequence is compared to a database
sequence, yielding a score that indicates the likelihood of homology.
This comparison is repeated for every sequence in the database and
high-scoring hits are reported. This basic procedure is shared by all
pairwise searches. The various tools available differ most noticeably
in speed and sensitivity (<I>e.g.</I>, whether, and how often,
insertions or deletions &#91;"indels"&#93; in one of the sequences
will cause the comparison to fail).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>A default scoring scheme is usually provided; this may be
overridden by the "power user". Most often this scoring scheme
consists of a substitution matrix, which specifies the likelihoods of
all possible point mutations. Other aspects of the scoring scheme can
be a gap penalty, specifying the cost of deletions, and a score
threshold for reporting hits. <!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 --></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><BR>
The fastest and most popular pairwise search tool is BLAST. The most
sensitive is the Smith-Waterman algorithm, of which the most common
implementation is SSEARCH.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>BLAST.</B> The BLAST program works on the principle that
regions of homology are likely to contain strongly conserved,
indel-resistant segments. These areas of strong conservation show up
as ungapped blocks in an alignment. Recent versions &#91;3&#93; are
also capable of producing gapped alignments, but they still build
these gapped alignments up from ungapped segments. This means that
BLAST is most likely to fail to detect a homologous sequence where
indels are scattered liberally and regularly throughout: in other
words, highly divergent sequences may be missed.</P>

<P>Searching for ungapped matches is much faster than searching for
gapped matches. BLAST speeds things up even more by looking initially
for matches to individual words in the query sequence. This makes
BLAST by far the quickest search program on the web today.</P>

<P>Public interfaces to BLAST can be found on the NCBI and EBI
websites:</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/</A></P>

<P><A HREF="http://www2.ebi.ac.uk/">http://www2.ebi.ac.uk/</A></P>

<P>A list of further BLAST servers can be found at:</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.sdsc.edu/ResTools/biotools/biotools1.html">http://www.sdsc.edu/ResTools/biotools/biotools1.html</A></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>BLAST databases.</B> The above BLAST servers search query
sequences against comprehensive databases such as GENBANK, SWISSPROT,
TREMBL or a non-redundant combination of these. In fact, this is true
of most search interfaces to be found on the web. Numerous local
databases, including the HIV database and many genome sequencing
projects, also offer BLAST interfaces to their sequences. It is less
common to find such databases offering interfaces to the other kinds
of search algorithm described below.</P>

<P><B>Low-complexity sequence filters.</B> A lot of theoretical work
has gone into assigning statistical significance to scores produced
by sequence alignment programs. BLAST is the best such studied
system. Unfortunately, most statistics can be skewed by repetitive or
low-information sequences such as DNA microsatellites or protein
coiled-coils. The problem of low-information sequences is so severe
that it is unwise to run any search tool without filtering it for
low-complexity segments. Programs such as SEG and DUST will handle
this. The BLAST server on the NCBI website (see above) is set up to
use these filters automatically and most mirror sites will have
filtering as a selectable option, if not the default.</P>

<P>A wide selection of tools for predicting and masking features such
as coiled-coil sequences can be found at:</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.expasy.ch/tools/">http://www.expasy.ch/tools/</A></P>

<P><B>The Smith-Waterman algorithm</B>. The Smith-Waterman algorithm
performs an exhaustive search of all possible gapped alignments
between a pair of sequences, given a particular set of scoring
parameters. At first this task may appear gargantuan, but the
algorithm employs a dynamic programming technique that keeps the
search time within manageable bounds. Nonetheless, Smith-Waterman
searches do take longer than BLAST searches (as may be expected,
since they're more exhaustive).</P>

<P>The most widely web-accessible implementation of Smith-Waterman is
SSEARCH &#91;4&#93;. The gain in sensitivity of Smith-Waterman has
also prompted some manufacturers (<I>e.g.</I>, Paracel, Compugen,
Time Logic) to produce hardware accelerators for dynamic programming
and some of these boxes also have web front-ends.</P>

<P>Links to web-accessible Smith-Waterman implementations can be
found at the following sites, among others:</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.expasy.ch/tools/%20similarity">http://www.expasy.ch/tools/
similarity</A></P>

<P><A HREF="http://www2.ebi.ac.uk/">http://www2.ebi.ac.uk/</A></P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.sdsc.edu/ResTools/biotools/biotools1.html">http://www.sdsc.edu/ResTools/biotools/biotools1.html</A></P>

<P><B>Smith-Waterman with pre-filtering</B>: FASTA, SCANPS. Somewhere
between BLAST and Smith-Waterman in the speed/sensitivity trade-off
lie a family of algorithms that initially pre-screen the database for
putative hit regions using fast heuristic rules (like BLAST), then
focus in on those regions with a full dynamic programming search
(like SSEARCH). <!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 --></P>

<P><BR>
Examples of these programs are FASTA &#91;5&#93; and SCANPS; the most
commonly encountered of these is FASTA.</P>

<P><B>Wise2.</B> Programs in the Wise2 suite can compare DNA and
protein sequences to one another directly, automatically translating
the DNA. For example, the GeneWise program can do a full
Smith-Waterman comparison between an amino acid sequence and a
stretch of unspliced, untranslated genomic DNA, reporting homologies
in spite of intron-exon structure and sequencing errors (including
frameshifts). The Wise2 tools are relatively slow to run, although
the package includes "HalfWise" programs that employ BLAST as a
pre-filter to speed up gene prediction. The Wise2 suite is written
using the dynamic programming language Dynamite &#91;6&#93;.</P>

<P>There is a form-based interface to some of the programs on the
Wise2 web site:</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Wise2/">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Wise2/</A></P>

<P><B>Bayesian alignment algorithms</B>. Also worth mentioning are
Bayesian probabilistic alignment methods. These handle distant
homologies by averaging over all possible evolutionary relationships
between a pair of sequences, rather than just picking the most likely
one. Notable Bayesian approaches include Lawrence et al's Bayes
aligner &#91;7&#93; and Bucher and Hofmann's PSW (probabilistic
Smith-Waterman) algorithm &#91;8&#93;.</P>

<P>The Bayes aligner is particularly well suited to sequences
suspected to contain several conserved ungapped blocks, such as
transmembrane proteins. Though not currently accessible through web
interfaces, it may be downloaded from:</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.wadsworth.org/resnres/bioinfo/software.html">http://www.wadsworth.org/resnres/bioinfo/software.html</A></P>

<P>The PSW algorithm is implemented in the Wise2 package:</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Wise2/">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Wise2/</A></P>

<P><B>Profile searches </B></P>

<P>Profile searches are considerably more sensitive than simple
pairwise searches as they make use of position-specific substitution
matrices (and sometimes position-specific gap penalties too).
Unfortunately they are also even slower than Smith-Waterman; it is
possible to use hardware accelerators to speed them up, but
interfaces to accelerated profile searches are rarely found on the
web.</P>

<P>In this section, tools to work with probabilistic profiles (the
most successful type of profile) are described.</P>

<P><B>Hidden Markov models.</B> The majority of profiling tools
currently available make use of hidden Markov models (HMMs). The
solid basis of HMMs in Bayesian machine learning theory has helped
this field considerably. Chief amongst HMM tools is the HMMER package
&#91;9&#93;; predating HMMER, but less widely used, is SAM
&#91;10&#93;.</P>

<P>To train an HMM profile from a set of sequences, it is generally
required that the sequences be aligned. Version 1 of HMMER attempted
to do this alignment itself, but good multiple sequence alignment is
a non-trivial challenge and so this feature has been dropped from
HMMER version 2. The most popular of the multiple alignment packages
available is CLUSTAL &#91;11&#93;. A recent benchmark of multiple
alignment programs may be found in &#91;12&#93;.</P>

<P>A comprehensive list of links to HMM-related software can be found
on the HMMER web site:</P>

<P><A HREF="http://hmmer.wustl.edu/">http://hmmer.wustl.edu/</A></P>

<P>SAM may be accessed via a web interface:</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/research/compbio/HMM-apps/HMM-applications.html">http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/research/compbio/HMM-apps/HMM-applications.html</A></P>

<P>The previously mentioned Wise2 package is capable of comparing
protein HMMs to DNA, as well as protein sequences.</P>

<P>The Wise2 web site is located at:</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Wise2/">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Wise2/</A></P>

<P><B>Stochastic context-free grammars</B>. A generalisation of
hidden Markov models, capable of modelling the nested correlations
between base pairs that are characteristic of RNA structures, are
"stochastic context-free grammars" or SCFGs &#91;2&#93;. While their
increased modelling power makes them <!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 --><BR>
<BR>
potentially more sensitive tools, SCFGs are considerably trickier to
use than HMMs and demand more computational resources. Software for
training SCFGs and using them to search sequence databases can be
downloaded from</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software/">http://www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software/</A></P>

<P><B>Automated searches</B></P>

<P><B>PSI-BLAST</B>. A major improvement on the original release of
BLAST, PSI-BLAST automates the process of profile construction and
database searching. Given a query sequence, PSI-BLAST will search a
sequence database for close relatives of the query, then construct a
profile using these relatives and search the database again using the
profile. This process can be repeated several times.</P>

<P>While it has been possible for some time to construct a fully
automated search-and-profiling tool from the modular components
described above, PSI-BLAST is the first such integrated system to
have gained wide appeal. Since its release, PSI-BLAST has proved a
highly popular and useful tool, due perhaps to its ease of use as
well as its increased speed and sensitivity compared to BLAST.</P>

<P>For reference, the successive steps performed in a single
PSI-BLAST iteration are summarised below:</P>

<P>Candidate match "seeds" are picked from the database using an
algorithm similar to BLAST (but incorporating a two-word-hit rule
that is more stringent than BLAST's single-hit rule, thereby saving
time later). Seeds are extended by exploring only high-scoring cells
in the dynamic programming matrix. An appropriate score cutoff for
these high-scoring alignment extensions is found by regression. The
parameters were estimated in simulations performed by the program
authors. Sufficiently high-scoring pairwise alignments between query
and database sequences are combined to give a multiple alignment with
no gaps in the query. Virtually identical sequences in this multiple
alignment are thrown out. Closely related sequences in the multiple
alignment are downweighted, using a sequence weighting scheme that
works best for small families. A substitution/deletion profile is
created using a pseudocount method to incorporate prior knowledge
into sparse datasets. This profile is used as a query and the whole
process begins again, performing a pre-specified number of iterations
before terminating. enumerate</P>

<P>Although the relative contribution of each step to the speed and
sensitivity gains of PSI-BLAST are not entirely clear from the
published data, it seems that step 1 yields a significant speed gain
over BLAST, steps 2-3 improve on the limited sensitivity of BLAST's
ungapped scoring scheme and steps 4-8 are profiling steps that focus
the next iteration of the search on probable family members.</P>

<P>An obvious problem with PSI-BLAST is the very same problem that
would be encountered were a profile being constructed manually: if a
chance similarity is mistakenly included in the profile training set
at an early stage, the error may become "fixed" if the next iteration
of the search algorithm picks up relatives of the imposter sequence
rather than members of the query family. This potential amplification
of false positives is an inherent feature of any iterative search
algorithm; the best way to guard against it is to manually check that
the sequences reported by the program appear relevant when compared
to the query, not just to one another.</P>

<P>The NCBI has a web interface to PSI-BLAST with an attractive
results display (Figure 2):</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/BLAST/nph-psi">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/BLAST/nph-psi</A></P>

<P>Arguably, there is considerable room for improvement on PSI-BLAST.
The previously-described tools specialising in multiple alignment and
profile training are much better at these jobs than the corresponding
parts of PSI-BLAST. This is particularly evident in the way that gaps
are handled. Packages such as MEME &#91;13&#93; and work on
probabilistic models of protein evolution &#91;14&#93; suggest that
more consistent approaches to integrated systems can be found. At the
time of writing, however, PSI-BLAST is the best (perhaps the only)
freely available reliable automated system for homologous sequence
discovery and its popularity signals a clear challenge for
computational biology to shift up a gear.</P>

<P><B>MEME.</B> MEME is a program for identifying motifs from a
training set of unaligned sequences &#91;13&#93;. Particularly suited
to finding short motifs such as nucleotide binding sites, it proceeds
by a "greedy" <!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 --><BR>

</B></P>

<H6><B><I>Figure 2.</I></B><I> The NCBI web interface to
PSI-BLAST.</I></H6>

<P>strategy: beginning with a hidden Markov model seeded on a single
subsequence from the training set, it iteratively refines this model
until no more improvements to the overall score can be found. This
algorithm is a reasonably fast and highly effective way of locating
repeated motifs. MEME is web-accessible:</P>

<P><A HREF="http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme/website/">http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme/website/</A></P>

<P><B>Gibbs sampling</B>. The Gibbs sampling algorithm for multiple
sequence alignment has become a popular tool for discovery of short
ungapped motifs &#91;15&#93;. The algorithm performs a "random walk"
through the space of multiple alignments, weighted by the likelihood
of those alignments (so that, over long enough times, high-scoring
alignments should be visited proportionally more often than
low-scoring ones).</P>

<P>Gibbs samplers are theoretically less prone to getting "stuck"
than greedy algorithms like MEME, as they are capable of making
choices that are unfavourable in the short term. The downside of this
is that convergence is unpredictable. The algorithm can be VERY slow
to run. Perhaps for this reason it is hard to find interfaces to
Gibbs samplers on the web; however, one can download software from
the following URL:</P>

Protein family databases </B></P>

<P>There are a number of efforts underway to attempt to organise the
protein database into clusters, corresponding to motifs that are
conserved throughout nature. Searching these databases rather than
the "raw" protein databases brings several advantages:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>the search is more sensitive, as the query sequence is
   compared to a profile of each family, domain or cluster rather
   than individual members of the cluster alone. This also makes the
   search process faster;</LI>
   
   <LI>the results of the search are more succinct than a typical
   "raw" database search;</LI>
   
   <LI>and the database may have links to other online resources,
   such as structure or functional annotation. itemize</LI>
</UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The main drawback is that the protein family database may be
inaccurate or incomplete</P>

<P>Unfortunately there is no good competitive evaluation of the
various protein family databases accessible on the web. It is
probably best to try more than one; most of them now contain
cross-references to one another anyway, as well as links to structure
and literature databases.</P>

<P>There follows a brief description of the most widely used
databases.</P>

<P><B>Pfam</B>. Pfam is a database of strictly non-overlapping
protein domains &#91;16&#93;. Each domain entry consists of a seed
alignment from which an HMM profile has been trained. Pfam is the
only protein family database to be built using HMM-profiles from the
very beginning and its development is inextricably linked with that
of the HMMER package.</P>

<P>In addition to the curated database (Pfam-A) there exists an
automatically generated database of putative families (Pfam-B), from
which more families are "upgraded" into Pfam-A with each release.</P>

<P>Pfam can be accessed at the following URLs:</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.cgr.ki.se/Pfam/">http://www.cgr.ki.se/Pfam/</A></P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/</A></P>

<P><A HREF="http://pfam.wustl.edu/">http://pfam.wustl.edu/</A></P>

<P><B>PROSITE.</B> PROSITE is a collection of protein families and
domains with comprehensive and thorough annotation that includes
links to scientific literature and even email addresses of
contactable experts &#91;17&#93;. The profiles for each domain are
manually constructed and less quantitatively flexible than the
statistical HMM methods used by Pfam.</P>

<P>PROSITE is located at:</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.expasy.ch/prosite/">http://www.expasy.ch/prosite/</A></P>

<P><B>PRINTS.</B> PRINTS is a well-annotated database of protein
fingerprints, each of which may be compounded of several distinct
motifs &#91;18&#93;. This approach differs from those described above
in that a single motif may be used by multiple fingerprints. This is
intended to reflect the observation that structural patterns may be
decomposed into smaller elements; thus the curators of PRINTS suggest
it to be a useful tool for recognising larger structural
patterns.</P>

<P>PRINTS is located at:</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/dbbrowser/PRINTS/PRINTS.html">http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/dbbrowser/PRINTS/PRINTS.html</A></P>

<P><B>ProDom.</B> The ProDom database is automatically generated from
a clustering of the protein sequence database which currently uses
the PSI-BLAST algorithm &#91;19&#93;. This automatic generation
procedure makes ProDom less tidy than some of the other databases,
but its coverage should be more complete.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.toulouse.inra.fr/prodom/doc/prodom.html">http://www.toulouse.inra.fr/prodom/doc/prodom.html</A></P>

<P><B>InterPro.</B> The above four databases (Pfam, PROSITE, PRINTS
and ProDom) have been gathered together as the composite database
InterPro. Sequences can be queried simultaneously against all four
databases and the results displayed in parallel. InterPro is
searchable online at the following URL:</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/</A></P>

<P><B>Blocks.</B> Blocks is a database of ungapped multiple
alignments &#91;20&#93;. The exclusion of gaps has two immediate
implications: firstly, some motifs present in the other databases
will be missing from Blocks; <!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 --><BR>
<BR>
and secondly, those motifs that are present will tend to be more
strongly conserved.</P>

<P>The Blocks database may be searched at the URL below. The search
engine can also search ungapped subsets of all the other protein
family databases mentioned above.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://blocks.fhcrc.org/">http://blocks.fhcrc.org/</A></P>

<P><B>SMART.</B> The SMART database, like Pfam, contains HMM profiles
of protein families &#91;21&#93;. Although it covers a smaller
fraction of the protein universe than Pfam (it contains around 400
families as opposed to Pfam's 2290), it compensates by providing
significantly enriched structural, functional and phyletic annotation
for each domain. SMART may be queried online at:</P>

<P><A HREF="http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/">http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/</A></P>

<P><B>Developments in integrated profiling </B></P>

<P>Multiple alignment, phylogenetic tree construction and sequence
profiling are all attempts to handle the observed statistical nature
of relationships between protein sequences. For maximum sensitivity
and precision, one would ideally like to be able to model all these
aspects of protein evolution using a single integrated tool.</P>

<P>PSI-BLAST may be viewed as one attempt at this. However, as has
been mentioned, it makes little use of statistical modelling theory.
More promising are probabilistic models of sequence evolution
emanating from the phylogenetics camp &#91;22, 23, 24, 14, 25&#93;
where debates on flavours of statistical method constitute a familiar
theme.</P>

<P>The common theme of these methods is to define a scoring function
for a set of sequences aligned to a profile and related by a
phylogenetic tree. The profile, alignment and tree that optimise this
(probabilistic) scoring function are then to be simultaneously
optimised. By taking phylogenetic correlations into account, these
methods are theoretically capable of detecting signals that
phylogenetically naive programs (read: most of the other algorithms
described in this article) will miss. It is the large number of
parameters and unknowns in this problem that favour approaches with a
solid mathematical foundation such as probabilistic modeling.</P>

<P>Perhaps the simplest of these models is the links model
&#91;22&#93;, in some ways the probabilistic multiple-alignment
analogue of the Smith-Waterman algorithm. This model treats residue
insertion and deletions as independent events that occur at a
constant rate along the length of the sequence, using a birth-death
process familiar from probability theory. The links model has been
implemented as a multiple alignment algorithm &#91;26&#93; which may
feasibly be extended to a non-homogenous profiling system by
concatenating multiple links models.</P>

<P>For profiles without gaps, the RIND program is an interesting and
effective way of modelling site-to-site heterogeneity in conservation
patterns and substitution rates for sets of pre-aligned protein
sequences &#91;24&#93;. RIND attempts to fit the best substitution
matrix to each separate column of an alignment, using a variant of
the EM algorithm from statistical theory that allows all the entries
in the rate matrices to vary.</P>

<P>In contrast, "tree HMMs" &#91;23, 14&#93; permit only a finite
number of rate matrices for each column, but are otherwise similar to
hidden Markov models in that they allow for large deletions (but not
insertions) relative to the profile. Tree HMMs are also capable of
aligning sequences de novo using methods akin to Gibbs sampling.
(Such methods tend to be less effective than dedicated multiple
alignment programs such as CLUSTAL &#91;11&#93; but are, arguably,
easier for independent parties to improve on.) A fusion of tree HMMs
with the links model would allow insertions, bringing tree HMMs
closer to the profile HMMs used for database searching by HMMER and
SAM, but this is speculation.</P>

<P>Probabilistic methods have many advantages over more heuristic
approaches. They are well-defined, facilitating both collaborative
and competitive development by multiple groups. They are also capable
of sophisticated refinement and great sensitivity, as has been
demonstrated in the case of profile HMMs. However they require
considerably more effort to develop than heuristic algorithms that
can be bolted together relatively quickly. It may be hoped that the
success of HMMs in modelling patterns in sequences will encourage
this effort to be spent in developing further probabilistic models in
sequence analysis and indeed bioinformatics in general. <!-- Generation of PM publication page 52 --></P>
