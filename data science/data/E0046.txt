Borland's newsgroup discussion forums are typically very helpful.&nbsp; Many
&quot;experts&quot; regularly monitor the posts and answer questions where they
can.&nbsp; The above two forums are the best places to post questions about
Rich Edit controls.&nbsp; However, there are numerous other forums that cover
everything from the IDE to Delphi.&nbsp; I suggest that you add the server
(forums.inprise.com) to your newsgroup reader and select the forums that most
interest you. <BR>

RxLib is an exceptional kit of tools.&nbsp; Complete with Delphi Pascal source

library is ever complete.&nbsp; On the other hand, if there ever was a free set
of tools that came close, this is it.&nbsp; The only real short-coming &#150;
and it is only a problem if you do not speak Russian &#150; is that there are
no English help files available from the authors.&nbsp; An English translation
is available at The Developer's Corner Journal and on Pete Fraser's FraserSoft
site (see the links above).&nbsp; Version 2.60+ of the RX Component Library

integrated into the Delphi IDE, the BCB IDE integration is, at this writing,

<P> Thanks to tips from site visitors, I learned that there are sites that have
or are working on editors that are, in some cases, substantially similar to the
Rich Edit control.&nbsp; For example, the Unix world is working on replacements
for the Microsoft Rich Edit control.&nbsp; Other sites are simply trying to
produce usable text editors and word processors that import and export Rich
Text Format (RTF) files.&nbsp; As I began chasing down the Rich Edit open
source sites, I discovered other cool stuff.&nbsp; I found sites that are
working on open source compilers, non-RTF editors, linkers, format converters,
assemblers, zip libraries, encryption tools &#150; the list goes on and on. 
</P>
<P> Be warned that I have not personally downloaded, installed, and tested the
code from all of these sites.&nbsp; (I wish that I had the time to do
that.)&nbsp; The information below is mostly glommed from the source
sites.&nbsp; If you find sites not mentioned here, please let me know.&nbsp;
Likewise, if you have comments about these sites (both positive and negative),
please let me know.&nbsp; Before committing to code from these sites, be sure

GExperts is an extensive set of add-in tools for the Borland Delphi and C++

search utility, a message dialog source code generator, a tool for backing up
the current project to a ZIP file, an option to export syntax-coded text to a
file, add keyboard shortcuts to comment/uncomment a block of code, and much
more.&nbsp; While I think that you really should try this code, a couple
warnings are in order: </P>
<UL>
<LI> While this is an &quot;open source&quot; project, some of the code depends
upon licensed code (such as VCLZip).&nbsp; I found that you cannot modify the
source without licensing code from others. </LI>
<LI> Much of the code works only with Delphi sources.&nbsp; For example, the
backup utility recognizes only Delphi files by default; I wanted to add BCB
files to the default but ceased my efforts to add support for BCB file types
after finding that a license for VCLZip was required in order to recompile the
project. </LI>
</UL>
<P> In summary, I think that BCB programmers should look at this tool.&nbsp;
However, until it is entirely free code, we will be forced to live with a
Delphi-centric implementation. </P>

An accessible book on compiler theory and design, it walks the reader through
the development of compiler development tools similar to LEX and YACC.&nbsp;
Each of the tools is presented with complete C code examples preceded by a
section on compiler, lexical analysis, or parser theory.&nbsp; This is not an

is a unique and useful source. </P>

The Developer's Information Library (DIL) is a CD collection of some of the
best technical information about Borland products assembled by the UK
Inprise/Borland User Group (UK/BUG).&nbsp; The CD includes tips taken from
newsgroups and excellent sites (including, ahem, this one); freeware,
shareware, and evaluation versions of programs; the latest Borland software
patches; a collection of several thousand image files; and &quot;antique
software&quot; (need a copy of Turbo C 1.01 or 2.01 or Turbo Pascal 3.02 or
5.5? -- it is on the CD).&nbsp; Of course, you can search through the database
by keyword and filter by category (BDE, C++, CBuilder, CORBA, Delphi, Java,
etc.). </P>
<P> To be fair, much -- if not all -- of the content is available on the

well-entrenched in larger companies, at least in file- and print-server

Delphi versions of the tools that BCB programmers can use.&nbsp; Perhaps I am

Need a free version control system (VCS) for personal use?&nbsp; Well, I
did.&nbsp; As best I remember, this is not a new version control product.&nbsp;
I recall checking this product out several years ago.&nbsp; Back then, it was
not well-integrated into the Windows programming environment.&nbsp; Today it
much more complete and, thankfully, there is a free personal edition available
for download..&nbsp; For what it is worth, I *think* that the product is based
upon the free Unix RCS (Revision Control System) with added support for the
Windows programming environment.&nbsp; Anyway, I suggest that you give it a try

If you need to convert RTF text to HTML or XML, you might want to check out
this site.&nbsp; In my limited tests, the tool translated my RTF files to
virtually identical HTML.&nbsp; The converter is highly configurable, so you
should be able to tweak it to generate exactly what you want, need, or
expect.&nbsp; I was primarily interested in adding the ability to translate RTF
to HTML from within my programs.&nbsp; However, Logictran supplies stand-alone
programs to convert files so, if you simply need to translate files, you can do
so without writing any code. </P>
<P> Frankly, I found the RTF converter to be a bit challenging to use at first
-- there were no BCB interfaces or samples.&nbsp; Worse, the documentation was
directed largely at Visual Basic programmers.&nbsp; (If you have never tried to
port VB OLE code to another language, be warned that it is harder than it
sounds.)&nbsp; Logictran's support was excellent and we quickly resolved the
problems; you can now find BCB sample code and documentation on the Logictran
site. </P>
