      <p>(Oct. 24, 2001)&nbsp;<br>
      A 1950 HRG 1500 is now on display at the Racing Research Center. The HRG
      takes the place of the 1948 MG TC that has been at the Center for the past
      several months. The MG TC is owned by Robert F. Snodgrass Jr. of
      Jacksonville, Fla. The MG TC next goes to the Saratoga (N.Y.) Automobile
      Museum.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The HRG is owned by Gary Ford of Pipersville, Pa. The car is the same
      type as the HRG that won the Watkins Glen Queen Catharine Cup in 1949. HRG
      built the basic design from 1935 through 1955. In that time, only 245 cars
      were built. The car was restored in 1999 and has won major Concours
      awards, including Best of Show at the Grand Prix Festival of Watkins Glen
      in 2000. The HRG will be displayed through December.</p>

      <p>WATKINS GLEN -- Sept. 20, 2001&nbsp;<br>
      Racing legend Dan Gurney is lending his hand - literally - to help the
      International Motor Racing Research Center at Watkins Glen with its 2001
      fund-raising car raffle. A 2001 Toyota MR2 Spyder is the grand prize in
      the raffle. It's &quot;Glen&quot; green, with a tan leather top and
      interior. And it has an additional, unique feature: The back of the
      driver's seat is signed by Gurney. The winner also will receive a
      photograph of Gurney in the car.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Only 1,000 raffle tickets will be sold at $100 each. Tickets will be
      offered until the drawing on Dec. 15 at the Center. The car will be
      delivered by Williams Toyota of Sayre, Pa. &quot;We are grateful for the
      cooperation of Dan Gurney and Williams Toyota in this effort to raise
      important funds for the Research Center,&quot; said Jon Beckman, the
      Center's development director. He noted that dealership owner Randy
      Williams has long been an active supporter of the Center and Gurney
      recently hosted a fund-raising auction at the Center.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The car raffle is crucial to the Center, which is supported solely by
      donations and fund-raisers. It opened in June 1999, with legendary driver
      Jackie Stewart as the honored guest. The Center welcomes casual race fans
      and serious researchers alike.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The heart of the collection is more than 2,500 rare and reference
      books, periodicals, photographs and more than 1,000 race films. The
      library also collects fine art and rare race posters. Raffle tickets are
      available now and may be purchased in person or by mail, at 610 S. Decatur
      St., Watkins Glen, N.Y. 14891. They also may be ordered by telephone, at

      <p>WATKINS GLEN -- Sept. 20, 2001&nbsp;<br>
      Marolyn Rogers, longtime chief registrar for IMSA, has been appointed to
      the Council of the International Motor Racing Research Center at Watkins
      Glen. Rogers takes over the Council seat held by her husband, Robert B.
      Rogers, Rear Admiral, U.S. Navy (Ret.) since the Center opened in June
      1999. She was appointed at the Council's annual meeting in early
      September.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>At the same session, Council member Bryan Sperber, president of Watkins
      Glen International, was appointed as vice president. Council member
      Michael R. Argetsinger, principal in Michael Argetsinger Communications, a
      Chicago public relations firm, was appointed secretary.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Rogers became involved with the Center in the very early days as she
      worked with her husband during the initial campaign to raise money to
      build the Center. &quot;Having a facility where people can come to read,
      study, research and archive information relating to motor racing is very
      special, and I am proud to be involved with it,&quot; Rogers says.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Originally from Statesville, N.C., she now resides in Fernandina Beach,
      Amelia Island, Fla. She developed a great interest in and love for the
      world of sportscar racing beginning in 1976 when she attended the Daytona
      24-Hour race. She later went to work for IMSA as chief registrar, a job
      she held until 1994. It was during this period of her life that she got to
      know most of the people involved in IMSA racing and the world of corporate
      sponsors. &quot;I loved being involved in that arena! It's like stepping
      into another world entirely when you go off to a race weekend. And then,
      on Monday, you go back to the 'other' world! The friends I made throughout
      those years are still good friends today,&quot; Rogers says.</p>

      <p>WATKINS GLEN - Aug. 29, 2001<br>
      Legendary racer Dan Gurney will be in the spotlight in September at the
      International Motor Racing Research Center at Watkins Glen. To celebrate
      Gurney's return to Watkins Glen as grand marshal of the Zippo U.S. Vintage
      Grand Prix, Sept. 7-9, at Watkins Glen International, the Racing Research
      Center has commissioned three works of art to capture great moments in
      Gurney's career.</p>
      <p>The artists are donating the original paintings to the Center's
      permanent collection. The Center also is being granted exclusive rights to
      produce a limited number of prints of two of the paintings.</p>
      <p>Gurney was the first driver to win championship races in all four major
      categories: Formula One, Indy, sports cars and stock cars. In 1964, with
      Carroll Shelby, he founded All American Racers, which would build Eagles
      to win Indy 500 races in 1968, 1973 and 1975.</p>
      <p>Driving an Eagle, Gurney won the Belgian Grand Prix in 1967, becoming
      the only American to win a Grand Prix driving his own car. This victory
      had followed by one week his triumph at Le Mans, where he inaugurated the
      famous tradition of spraying champagne.</p>
      <p>The Center's Gurney prints will be available for sale starting Friday,
      Sept. 7, during the Grand Prix Festival of Watkins Glen, the downtown
      celebration of the village's racing history. They also will be sold at the
      Center, at Watkins Glen International during the Vintage Grand Prix
      weekend and on the Center's Web site at <a href="http://www.racingarchives.org" target="main">www.racingarchives.org</a>.</p>
      <p>The 200 numbered prints will be sold in sets of two or singly. The cost
      of a set will be $125. A single print will be $75. A set of artists'
      proofs will be $250.<br>
      All prints will be signed by Gurney and by the artists.<br>

      <p>WATKINS GLEN - Aug. 29, 2001<br>
      The International Motor Racing Research Center at Watkins Glen is helping
      to celebrate the history of racing here by sponsoring one of the key
      components of the upcoming downtown festival.<br>
      The Grand Prix Festival of Watkins Glen honors the village's rich
      motorsports history. The daylong event will be Friday, Sept. 7, preceding
      the Zippo U.S. Vintage Grand Prix at Watkins Glen International Sept. 8-9.<br>
      Upwards of 40,000 people will attend the Festival, which offers a variety
      of activities, including two road rallies, re-enactments of racing through
      the streets, a Concours d'Elegance and a model car Concours, children's
      racing and a panel discussion about motorsports.<br>
      The Racing Research Center is sponsoring the panel discussion, dubbed
      &quot;The Legends Speak.&quot;<br>
      John Fitch, a legendary Cunningham driver, and Bob Lutz, a partner in the
      Cunningham Motor Co., will be on the panel, as well as noted motorsports
      journalist Brock Yates, the famed Bill Milliken and vintage racer Ed
      Diehl.<br>
      The Legends Speak is a panel seminar featuring folks who have their place
      in Watkins Glen history books or who have significant roles in the world
      of motorsports. This event gives spectators the opportunity to listen to
      and ask questions of these &quot;legends.&quot;<br>
      The Legends Speak is at 4 p.m. at The Glen Theater at the northern end of
      Franklin Street. Admission is $5, which helps finance future festivals. It
      will last about 90 minutes.<br>
      Preceding The Legends Speak, starting at noon, historic racing videos,
      including a film of the 1951 Watkins Glen races, will be shown at the
      theater. There is no admission fee for the films, but donations are
      gratefully accepted to benefit the Racing Research Center.<br>
      With the Cunningham the featured car of this year's Festival, The Legends
      Speak is pleased to present two significant players in the saga of the
      Cunningham.<br>

      Montanari's evocative European architectural backgrounds for Ferrari and
      other classic marques.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>An informal wine and cheese reception, sponsored by Vintage Racecar
      Journal, will take place on Saturday, Sept. 8, starting at 1 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>All are welcome to come and meet Montanari. &quot;Naturally I'm very
      excited that the Research Center is the site of my first one-man show. My
      purpose in this is simply to compliment the great preservation work they
      are doing there.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Montanari, of Hopewell, N.J., was the featured artist at the Pittsburgh
      Vintage Grand Prix in 1998 and 1999 and was selected to paint the event
      poster for the 1999 Castle Hill Concours d'Elegance in Ispwich, Mass.
      Universal Studios contracted him to produce a limited edition lithograph
      based on Ralf Schumacher, Juan Pablo Montoya and the BMW/Williams Formula
      One Team.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>WATKINS GLEN --July 2001</p>
      <p>In the spirit of remembering a thrilling moment at Watkins Glen, the
      International Motor Racing Research Center at Watkins Glen has sponsored a
      photo billboard of Gilles Villeneuve in the rain in 1979.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Despite the treacherous conditions, Villeneuve masterfully
      controlled the Ferrari during this practice lap for the U.S. Grand Prix.
      He nearly broke the track speed record during the cloudburst of
      rain.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The shriek and shrill of hearing the V12 in the rain, through the
      hills, is captured in the photo by John A. Doddato of Big Flats, N.Y. The
      photo is titled &quot;Break Away.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/sitephotos/billboard.jpg" width="480" height="308"></p>
      <p>The billboard is located just north of Watkins Glen on state Route 14,
      one of the main entryways into the village. It is part of a series of
      billboards highlighting points of interest and characteristics of the
      region. The project is sponsored by the ARTS of the Southern Finger Lakes.
      The billboards will be up through the end of September.</p>

      <p>WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. - Four racing greats, including two World Champions, have agreed to be the inaugural members of the Racing Research Center's new Drivers Council.</p>
      <p>Jackie Stewart, Mario Andretti, Hurley Haywood and Rusty Wallace will lend their incomparable expertise to help the Center develop its collections.</p>
      <p>The Racing Research Center is dedicated to the preservation of the history of all motorsports. This non-for-profit facility, located in the home of American road racing, is unique because it is open to the serious researcher and casual fan alike. Its collections include more than 2,500 rare and reference books, fine art, photographs, programs, periodical and hundreds of films.</p>
      <p>Stewart, Andretti and Haywood have well-established relationships with the Center, going back to its first days, when Stewart was the honored guest at the Center's opening in June 1999. While not as familiar with the Center's operations, Wallace is a welcome newcomer to the effort.</p>
      <p>"It's certainly an honor and a pleasure to serve on the Council," says Wallace, who can boast of 54 NASCAR Winston Cup wins. "There is so much history that's wrapped up in motorsports. To be part of this exciting new project is quite a thrill. It promises to be very interesting."</p>
      <p>Since it was established, the Center has been guided by a Council composed of racing aficionados, library professionals and civic and community leaders. The Drivers Council will enhance their efforts.</p>
      <p>"I'm extremely pleased and delighted to welcome the Drivers Council," Council President John Bishop says. "With names like Andretti, Haywood, Stewart and Wallace, it gives us an unprecedented high level of support for the mission of the Center from the pinnacle of motor racing icons."</p>
      <p>Haywood is an especially dedicated friend of the Center. The endurance-driving champion is chairman of the Center's 2001 Sponsorship Team membership drive. His letter has led to more than 200 people joining to support the work of the Center. New memberships are received every day.</p>
      <p>He hosted a fund-raising auction in June 2000 and was here for this year's June event, hosted by Ron Fellows.</p>
      <p>"This is a unique facility within which to research motorsports information," Haywood says. "Being able to give information to create better collections is just incredible."</p>
      <p>Formula One World Champions Andretti and Stewart also have praised the Center's efforts. Andretti was here for a lengthy visit in May 2000, and Stewart was here for the opening.</p>
      <p>At that time, Stewart accurately predicted the success of the Center, which is reflected in the creation of the Drivers Council.</p>
      <p>"Don't think the job is over," he said then, "you will find that one day it will have to be expanded. The sport should be very proud."</p>

      <p>WATKINS GLEN - Phil McCray, who served as director and curator of the

      <p>McCray will head Upstate Archival Consultants, a firm specializing in
      providing archival service and advice to historical societies, colleges
      and private collections.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&quot;The first two years of the Racing Research Center have been a
      great pleasure for me personally, and I have met many interesting and
      gracious people in my time here,&quot; McCray said. &quot;We have together
      accomplished a great deal in preserving the documentary heritage of
      motorsports.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Bryan Sperber, president of Watkins Glen International and a member of
      the Center's Council, will act as interim executive director for the
      Center until a new director is hired.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&quot;Phil was instrumental in moving the Research Center from an idea
      to an internationally respected motor racing archive,&quot; Sperber said.
      &quot;I'm disappointed that Phil is leaving us, but I'm excited that he
      will be moving into an area that will be a new challenge for him. I wish
      him much success in his new venture.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

      <p>WATKINS GLEN - One of the earliest MGs shipped by the factory in
      England to the United States is now on display at the International Motor
      Racing Research Center at Watkins Glen.&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="images/sitephotos/mg.jpg" target="main"><img border="0" src="images/sitephotos/mgs.jpg" alt="1948 MG TC" width="336" height="222"></a></p>
      <p>The black 1948 MG TC was purchased from Inskip Motors on Long Island in
      early 1948. Elmira engineer R. Fred Snodgrass and his friend and fellow
      enthusiast John Riggs, also from Elmira, picked up the car, as well as an
      identical red one.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Snodgrass Sr. and his son, Bob, then age 6, attended the first race at
      Watkins Glen in 1948 in the MG TC. This &quot;one-family&quot; classic is
      on loan to the Racing Research Center by its owner Robert F. Snodgrass Jr.
      and the Brumos Collection of Jacksonville, Fla.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Snodgrass Jr., owner of Brumos Porsche in Jacksonville, has been a
      member of the Center's Council since the facility opened in June
      1999.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&quot;This beautiful MG has immense aesthetic and historical value. It
      also represents the great care and respect that can be taken with memories
      and motorsports,&quot; said Phil McCray, Center director and
      curator.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The car will be on display in the Center's atrium through June 3, the
      weekend of the Watkins Glen Historic Races at Watkins Glen
      International.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The MG TC stayed in Elmira until 1962, at which time Snodgrass Sr. was
      transferred to Minden, La. The MG was transported to Louisiana, where it
      remained until 1978, when the family relocated to Muncy, Pa., upon the
      retirement of Snodgrass Sr. Robert Soars of Muncy completed a full,
      frame-off restoration in 1984.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Subsequently, ownership of the car was transferred to Snodgrass Jr.,
      who has shown the car in many events across the Southeastern United States
      with fantastic results. Numerous Best of Show awards and countless First
      Place trophies in local and regional competitions have been won from 1985
      to the present.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The MG is perhaps one of the most correct of its type in existence.
      Under the bonnet, or hood, is a perfectly detailed and
      sewing-machine-smooth four-cylinder engine producing 54 horsepower. Top
      speed of 72 mph, coupled with the huge 19-inch wheels and skinny Dunlop
      tires, made racing these cars in the early days of Watkins Glen a real
      challenge, Snodgrass Jr. says.</p>

      Over the winter of 2000-2001 the featured race car in the atrium was
      Victor Franzese's McLaren. Press release below. </p>
      <p><b>For immediate release Jan. 8, 2001</b></p>
      <p>WATKINS GLEN - A McLaren M12 that raced at Watkins Glen in the early
      1970s is now greeting visitors to the International Motor Racing Research
      Center at Watkins Glen.</p>
      <p>The gold and green car, known as the &quot;Champagne Car,&quot; is on loan
      from Victor Franzese, owner of the Glen Motor Inn, Route 14, north of
      Watkins Glen.</p>
      <p>The McLaren will remain in the center through early spring. It is
      located in the atrium, which was specially designed to display a car.</p>
      <p>Franzese is the original owner of the McLaren. He purchased it as a
      rolling chassis in 1971 and finished it in a shop in Montour Falls. The
      car was raced in the full 1971 Can-Am series, including that year's event
      at Watkins Glen.</p>
      <p>Its main sponsor was Great Western Champagne, produced by Pleasant
      Valley Wine Co. of Hammondsport, leading to its nickname.</p>
      <p>Ron Goldleaf drove the M12 for Franzese during part of the '71 season,
      including its appearance in the Can-Am series race at Watkins Glen. Other
      drivers that year were Bob Nagle, who set a track record at Watkins Glen
      during an SCCA National event, and Gary Wilson.</p>
      <p>Franzese takes the wheel these days, in both Sportscar Vintage Racing
      Association and Historic Sportscar Racing events.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's fun to drive because it's a real race car,&quot; Franzese
      said. &quot;But it's a real challenge because it's dangerous. It can get
      away from you.&quot;<!--mstheme--></font></td>
