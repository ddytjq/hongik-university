<h1>ARTICLE III - GUTS</h1>

<p><u>Comment</u>: Guts is a sport played between two teams of
one to five players each. The objective is to be the first team
to score 21 points. To start play, each team lines up facing each
other 14 m apart. Play is accomplished by a player attempting to
throw the disc toward or at the opposing team and within the
reach of at least 1 player of that team, in such a manner that
the opposing team cannot make a clean catch. Scoring is
contingent on the success or failure of the throwing team. A good
throw, without a catch, results in a point for the throwing team
and a bad throw results in a point for the receiving team.</p>

                the other team. </li>
            <li><a name="302.05"></a>302.05 <u>Cleats</u>: Cleats

            <li><a name="303.01"></a>303.01 <u>Rules in Effect</u>:
                The WFDF rules of play shall govern play for
                guts, except that a game may be played under any
                variations of the rules, if said variations are
                agreed upon by the two teams. In tournament play,
                such variations are subject to the approval of
                the tournament director. <ul>
                    <li>A. <i>Determining Possession</i>: To
                        determine which team will have possession
                        at the start of the game, the disc
                        flipping method shall be used as set
                        forth in Article I of WFDF rules. The
                        winner of the flip has the option of
                        choosing to make the first throw or
                        choosing the side of the field they will
                        defend. The loser of the flip shall be
                        given the remaining choice. In a two out
                        of three match, the team losing each game
                        has the option to choose first in the
                        following game. </li>
                    <li>B. <i>Start of Play</i>: Prior to
                        commencing the exchange, the team
                        designated to make the first throw shall
                        choose a thrower. The thrower shall
                        signalhis or her intention to deliver the
                        throw by raisinghis or her arm and shall
                        wait for a corresponding signal of
                        readiness from the receiving team. After
                        the readiness signal is received, all
                        players on the throwing team, other than
                        the thrower, shall hold their positions
                        until the exchange is initiated. </li>
                    <li>C. <i>Readiness</i>: Prior to the
                        commencement of the exchange, a player on
                        the receiving team shall signalhis or her
                        team's readiness to accept the throw,
                        either vocally or by raisinghis or her
                        arm. At that time, all players on the
                        receiving team shall be positioned with
                        their toes on the goal line and at such a
                        distance apart that two players in
                        adjacent positions shall be able to touch
                        finger tips by extending their respective
                        arms parallel to the ground in the
                        direction of each other. Each player must
                        remain in their position until the throw
                        is released. </li>
                    <li>D.<i> The Exchange</i>: The exchange
                        consists of the throw and the attempted
                        catch, and ends upon a catch being made
                        or a point being scored. </li>
                    <li>E. <i>Movement by Receiving Team:</i>
                        Once the disc is released by the thrower,
                        players on the receiving team may move in
                        any direction. </li>
                    <li>F. <i>Play:</i> Play is accomplished by
                        continuing one exchange after the next
                        until one team scores enough points to
                        win the game. After an exchange is
                        completed, the teams shall alternate
                        their roles such that the team that was
                        the throwing team on the previous
                        exchange shall become the receiving team,
                        and vice versa. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a name="303.02"></a>303.02 <u>Throwing</u>: <ul>
            <li>A. <i>Designation of Thrower</i>: The designation
                of a player to be the thrower for a given
                exchange shall be made by one of the following
                methods, depending upon the circumstances: <ul>
                    <li>(1) Option of Throwing Team: The throwing
                        team shall choose the thrower for an
                        exchange for the initial throw of the
                        game. </li>
                    <li>(2) Contingent Upon Previous Exchange:
                        Whenever a player makes a good catch
                        whilehis or her team is receiving, that
                        player shall be the thrower on the
                        subsequent exchange. If two players are
                        equidistant from the throw and both fail
                        to touch it, then the throwing team will
                        decide which of the two players shall
                        return the throw. Whenever the players on
                        the receiving team fail to make a good
                        catch, but do touch the disc during the
                        exchange, the player who first touched
                        the disc shall be the thrower on the
                        subsequent exchange. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>B. <i>Good Throw</i>: A good throw is made when
                all of the following requirements are met: <ul>
                    <li>(1) The throw travels to or through the
                        scoring zone of a player on the receiving
                        team, reaching the goal line prior to
                        touching the ground; </li>
                    <li>(2) The throw crosses or hits the goal
                        line topside up at an angle of less than
                        90 degrees to the ground; </li>
                    <li>(3) The throw is released while the
                        thrower's supporting points are behind
                        the foul line; and </li>
                    <li>(4) The disc is not intentionally bent to
                        alter its true flight. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>C. <i>Positioning of Teammates</i>: Teammates of
                the thrower may stand anywhere behind the foul
                line during the throwing exchange so long as
                their location does not obstruct the vision of,
                or otherwise distract the receiving team. </li>
            <li>D. <i>Fouls</i>: Fouls occur whenever the thrower
                steps on the line before or during the release.
                Fouls shall be called by a designated player of
                the throwing team as they occur. The player
                designated shall be located on one end of the
                foul line to provide a clear view of the position
                of the thrower relative to the line. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a name="303.03"></a>303.03 <u>Catching</u>: <ul>

                all of the following requirements: <ul>
                    <li>(1) The disc shall be held solely in one
                        hand long enough to establish complete
                        control; </li>
                    <li>(2) The disc shall not be touched by any
                        two parts of a player's body at any one
                        time; and </li>
                    <li>(3) The disc shall not touch the ground
                        prior to all other prerequisites being
                        satisfied. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a name="303.04"></a>303.04 <u>Scoring Zone</u>: <ul>
            <li>A. <i>Definition</i>: The scoring zone is an area
                within which a receiving player, by using optimum
                effort, can reach an on-coming disc without
                leavinghis or her feet. The scoring zone is in
                effect a two-dimensional vertical plane,
                perpendicular to the field and intersecting the
                field at the goal line. The perimeter of the
                scoring zone is delineated as follows: <ul>
                    <li>(1) The bottom of the plane shall be the
                        goal line; </li>
                    <li>(2) The top of the plane is an imaginary
                        line, directly above and parallel to the
                        goal line, which intersects the top of
                        the longest finger of the longer arm of
                        the receiving player when said arm is
                        extended upward and perpendicular to the
                        ground; </li>
                    <li>(3) The sides of the plane are imaginary
                        lines, one on each side of the player,
                        perpendicular to the goal line and the
                        top of the plane, which intersect the
                        outstretched longest fingers of each arm
                        of the player when his or her arms are
                        held parallel to the goal line. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>B. <i>Optimum Effort</i>: A player shall not be
                required to leave the ground to reach a throw. If
                a receiving player does move in such a way (such
                as jump) as to vertically increase his or her
                reach beyond his or her optimum effort, a throw
                by or below the required outstretched hand shall
                constitute a good throw, notwithstanding that the
                throw may have been outside the player's original
                scoring zone prior to the movement. By moving
                vertically, a player increases the height of his
                or her scoring zone. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a name="303.05"></a>303.05 <u>Scoring</u>: <ul>
            <li>A. <i>Game</i>: Each game shall be played until
                one team scores 21 points, with a margin of
                victory of at least two points. <ul>
                    <li>(1) A game with a score of 20 to 20 goes
                        into overtime and play continues until a
                        two- point margin is achieved by a team. </li>
                    <li>(2) Teams should switch ends of court at
                        11-point (cumulative) intervals. </li>
                </ul>

            <li>B. <i>Points</i>: <ul>
                    <li>(1) A point shall be scored by the
                        throwing team whenever a good throw is
                        made into a scoring zone of one of the
                        receiving players and the receiving team
                        fails to make a good catch, unless a foul
                        was committed by the throwing team, in
                        which case no point is scored. </li>
                    <li>(2) A point shall be scored by the
                        receiving team whenever the throwing team
                        fails to make a good throw, unless the
                        failure was the result of a foul, in
                        which no point is scored. The receiving
                        team shall not be required to make a good
                        catch if a good throw is not made. </li>
                    <li>(3) A good throw by the throwing team
                        with a corresponding good catch by the
                        receiving team shall not be scored as a
                        point for either team. </li>

    </li>
    <li>303.06 <u>Substitutions</u>: <ul>
            <li>A. <i>When Allowable</i>: Substitutions may be
                made, at any time, after one team reaches 11
                points in the match. Further, there shall be no
                restrictions on a player returning to play after
                having left for a substitution. </li>
            <li>B. <i>Injury</i>: A team may substitute, at any
                time, for an injured player. Further, a team may
                substitute a player who is not a member of the
                team, for an injured player, as long as that
                player is not registered as a player on any other
                guts team in the tournament. The injured player
                is not permitted to return for the remainder of
                the match. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a name="303.07"></a>303.07 <u>Judging</u>: <ul>
            <li>A. <i>General</i>: The players shall generally
                make the calls in the match. Usually the thrower
                shall make calls on the throw and the receiver
                shall make calls on the catch. </li>
            <li>B. <i>Disputes</i>: In the event of a dispute,
                the team captains shall meet to discuss and
                resolve the dispute. If the dispute cannot be
                resolved, the throw attempt shall be repeated. </li>
            <li>C. <i>Observers</i>: At their discretion, the
                captains, or the captains and the tournament
                director, may decide to select up to three
                experienced individuals, who are not
                participating in the game, to act as observers.
                The duty of the observer is to carefully watch
                the action of the game for the sole purpose of
                rendering a decision in the event of a dispute
                that cannot be <h96.0007>resolved. Observers shall remain
                passive and shall not make any calls on their own
                initiative. <ul>
                    <li>(1) When a dispute arises which cannot be
                        resolved by the players involved or their
                        captains, the observers may be called
                        upon by the captains to make the call.
                        The observer with the best view of the
                        play makes the call. If the observers
                        choose, they may discuss the play among
                        themselves before rendering a decision. </li>
                    <li>(2) By calling in the observers, the
                        teams agree to abide by the observers'
                        decision. </li>
                    <li>(3) Use of observers will be based on the
                        observer's handbook. </li>

            <li><u>Exchange</u>: One play of guts, commencing
                with the throw and ending with either a catch by
                the receiving team or a point being scored. </li>
            <li><u>Foul Line</u>: One of two parallel lines, 14 m
                apart, the other line being designated as the
                goal line. The foul line is the line closer to
                the throwing team while the goal line is the line
                closer to the receiving team. </li>
            <li><u>Goal Line</u>: <a href="#301.01">See 301.01</a>
                relating to &quot;foul line&quot; for

            <li><u>Good Throw</u>: A throw that meets the
                requirements set forth in <a href="#303.02">section
                303.02(B)</a>. </li>
            <li><u>Optimum Effort</u>: The extension of the hands
                and arms by the player on the receiving team
                nearest the disc as it crosses the goal line. </li>
            <li><u>Receiving Team</u>: During an exchange, the
                team involved in attempting to catch the thrown
                disc. </li>
            <li><u>Scoring Zone</u>: Area within which a
                receiving player, by extending his or her arms
                and hands, can reach an oncoming disc while his
                or her feet remain stationary. The scoring zone
                shall be delineated by an imaginary vertical
                plane as more fully set forth in <a
                href="#303.05">section 303.05</a> herein. Each
                player has an individual scoring zone to his or
                her optimum effort. The team scoring zone is
                simply the cumulative of th player scoring zones.
            </li>
            <li><u>Throwing Team</u>: In an exchange, the team
                who is attempting to score by making a throw into
                a scoring zone of a player on the receiving team.
            </li>
            <li><u>Vertical Plane</u>: A plane, perpendicular to
                the ground, being two dimensional in nature, with
                said dimension defined by the foul line. With
                respect to the receiving team, the vertical plane
                shall equal the scoring zone, and shall be finite
                as set forth in <a href="#303.05">section 303.05
                herein</a>. With respect to the vertical plane
                relating to the throwing team, the plane shall be
                infinite in nature, defined only by the proximity
                of the foul line and its perpendicular angle to
                the field. <hr>
