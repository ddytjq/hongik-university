<p>This chapter discusses porting 32-bit code written for other
compilers to DJGPP.  Mainly for console (TTY or text mode)
applications, and I am bias towards Watcom V11.0 (and 10.5).  In this
chapter I will cover: </p>

</ol></p>


<h2>Watcom</h2>

<p>You may be wondering, if you have Watcom, why use DJGPP in the
first place.  Well I will be the first to admit that Watcom generates
some of the tightest code I have ever seen from a compiler.  However
DJGPP is fairly respectiable too.  DJGPP and WATCOM both share alot of
the same optimizations.  However the area where WATCOM really shines
is in <strong>register calling convention</strong> and
<strong>floating point math</strong>.  In this section I will cover
the runtime differences, which are few.  The tools and how to use them
(compared to Watcom) and what optimizations switches you would like to
use (based on what you used for WATCOM).</p>

<h3>Runtime Difference</h3>

<p>The nice thing about standards, is that they differ very slightly.
Now you make think that a standard doesn't change, but you would be
thinking wrong.  First off WATCOM's differences are to make
programming PC's (i386) a whole lot easier.  Where DJGPP strives to be
compatible with GCC (which it is based on).</p>

<h4>Hardware I/O</h4>

<p>Hardware IO, is provided via the following functions:
<tt>inportb</tt>, <tt>inportw</tt>, <tt>inportl</tt>,
<tt>outportb</tt>, <tt>outportw</tt>, <tt>outportl</tt>.  All of which
are defined in <strong>PC.H</strong>.  You use the
<strong>inport</strong>X functions to read from the ports and
<strong>outport</strong>X to write to them.  The X denotes one of the
following.  <strong>b</strong> for a 8-bit byte sized operand.
<strong>w</strong> for a 16-bit word sized operand.
<strong>l</strong> for a 32-bit long sized operand.</p>

<pre>
/* Code example to write and read from ports */
#include &lt;pc.io&gt;

int main(void)
{
    char a;

    /* read a byte from port 0x100 */
    a = inportb(0x100);

    /* write it to port 0x200 */
    outportb(0x200, a);
}
</pre>

<p> It's that simple </p>

<h4>Inline Assembly</h4>

<p>We all know that sometimes C doesn't suffice and you must use
inline assembly for performace.  Well in DJGPP that too is no
exception.  Therefore DJGPP provides a method for doing so.  I will
write a simple yet complete inline function in watcom, then covert it
to DJGPP and comment on it.</p>

<p>DJ help me, I couldn't find info on inline asm in the gcc.inf!!!
[it's under "Externsions...C..Asm" - DJ] </p>

<h4>Inline Functions</h4>

<p>Sometimes a function is small and written in C, and since you want
it to become portable you decided to keep it in C.  However you would
like to inline to save time.  Well that's ok, DJGPP supports this too.
Making an inlined function is really quite simple watch.</p>

<pre>
/* TEST.H */

__INLINE__ int sum(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}

</pre>

<p>That simple.  Note the <strong>__INLINE__</strong> is used in ANSI
C headers only.  In C code you would use <strong>inline</strong>, but
this only effects the one module only.  In C and objective C, the
<strong>inline</strong> has no effect on how the object is linked in
externally.  Put simply, if you use the <tt>inline</tt> keyword, the
function will be inlined for all the other functions in that one
compilation, and leads me to suggest not to define
<strong>inline</strong> functions in headers, since that is bad
design.</p>

<pre>
/* Test.C */

inline int sum(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}

int test(int a, b, c)
{
    return sum(a,b) + sum(b,c) + sum(c,a);
}
</pre>

<p>In this case, the function sum is inlined in test.  Had you made a
header to call <strong>sum</strong> from outside of this compilation,
you would not have it inlined, <em>even if you add __INLINE__.</em>

<h4>Zero based segments</h4>

<p> In WATCOM you can write to the video memory, using the address
0xA0000 however this is <strong> not true in DJGPP</strong>.  I
suggest you read 'porting from 16-bit compilers' also written by me.
It's <a
href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/ug/compiling/port16.html">here</a
>.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<h3>Compiler Tools</h3>

<p>In every compiler suite you must master (or atleast be able to use)
the compiler tools contained within.  However for most ms-dos users,
who are used to Sybase or Borland style compilers, may find DJGPP
slightly harder to get started with.  However this is not the case.
</p>

<h4>WCL386</strong> vs. <strong>GCC</h4>

<p>WCL386 is Sybases' frontend tool, that will compile, assemble and
link together source/object code to make a final image (read EXE
file).  DJGPP includes a front end too, and in my opinion is easier to
use.  It's called GCC and you will find it in
<strong>\DJGPP\BIN\</strong>.  One difference between them two that
bothered me at first, is that GCC doesn't provide the help screens.
However, determination got me thru it.  It's quite simple.</p>

<h4>Compile Only</h4>

<p>With WCL386 you can type in: <tt>'WCL386 /c file1.c file2.c
file3.c'</tt> to just compile and assemble the source code.  This will
get you object files that you may wish to distribute.  With DJGPP it's
quite the same.  Just type <tt>'GCC -c file1.c file2.c file3.c'</tt>
to get the resulting object files.  You should note that with DJGPP
objects files are in COFF format and have the <strong>.O</strong> file
name extension.</p>

<h4>Linking libraries</h4>

<p>With WCL386 you can type
in <tt>'WCL386 file1.c file2.lib'</tt> to compile, assemble and link
file1.c with file2.lib.  In GCC it gets a little more complicated.  In
DJGPP library files have a <strong>.A</strong> file name extension.
Now the way you link in libraries is dependant on one thing.  If the
library is in your <strong>\DJGPP\LIB</strong> directory, the library
must have <strong>LIB</strong> as the first three letters of the
filename.  I.e test2.lib would be called <strong>libtest2.a</strong>.
Now to compile/link it, type <tt>'GCC test1.c -ltest2 -o
test1.exe'</tt> I just introduced something else, the
<strong>-o</strong> switch.  (Note: make sure you use a small letter
o, otherwise it will toggle the optimizer).  This will make it produce
test1.exe instead of the default <strong>A.EXE</strong>.  Now if the
library is in your current directory.  You <strong>don't</strong> need
to append the letters LIB to the filename.  And to compile/link type
<tt>'GCC test1.c test2.a -o test1.exe'</tt>

<h4>Making libraries</h4>

<p>To make a library with
WATCOM you would type <tt>'WLIB mylib.lib +test.obj +test2.obj'</tt>
and in DJGPP it's just as simple.  Just type <tt>'AR RS mylib.a test.o
test2.o'</tt> and you have library called <strong>mylib.a</strong> for
your use.  If you want to put this library in
<strong>\DJGPP\LIB</strong> thne you should append
<strong>LIB</strong> to the beginning of the filename.  For example:
<tt>'AR RS LIBMYLIB.A test.o test2.o'.</tt></p>

<h4>MAKE vs WMAKE</h4>

<p>With WATCOM you have WMAKE, to process <tt>makefile</tt>s.  In
DJGPP the program is the same, only it's called <strong>MAKE</strong>.
However sometimes WATCOM makefiles will not port to DJGPP because they
use WATCOM extenstions.</p>

<h4>Optimizer Switches</h4>

<p>hmmm....</p>

<p>This concludes my section on Watcom.  If you have any other ideas,
questions, comments, queries, or problems, just email me.

<h2>LCC-WIN32</h2>

<h3>Runtime Differences</h3>

<p>Well LCC-WIN32 is not a dos compiler so there are a few
differences.  :) </p>

<ol>
    <li> No DPMI
    <li> No INT (can't call realmode ones, and can't set one up)
</ol>

<p>Basically when you program for LCC-WIN32 in console mode, or want
to program portably, you must stick to the standard.  That is what LCC
(LCC- WIN32 is based on) was designed for.  It follows the ANSI C
standard closer in more repsects to GCC, but has no addons.  LCC-WIN32
is a port of LCC to make Win32 code (which you must already know :) ).
</p>

<p>Although there is no INT support (IRQ handler, or call real mode
int) there is always a work around.  Say you wanted to hook a INT to
tell when to play music, well in LCC-WIN32 you just use Windows Media
Functions.  </p>

<p>Other then that, porting console mode (text mode) applications to
LCC-WIN32 is really quite simple.  In fact, most GNU software will
port to LCC- WIN32 quite quickly.  </p>

<h3>Compiler Tools</h3>

<h4>Compiling</h4>

<p>In LCC-WIN32 you would type
<tt>'LCC -c test.c'</tt> to compile test.c to an object.  In DJGPP
it's just as easy.  <tt>'GCC -c test.c'</tt> is all you need.</p>

<h4>Linking Libraries</h4>

<p>In LCC-WIN32 to link in a
library you would type <tt>'LCCLNK test.obj test2.lib'</tt> And that
would like <tt>test.obj</tt> and <tt>test2.lib</tt> together (along
with the standard c lib) to make a program.  In DJGPP it's quite
similar.  However there is slight difference.  (Read the watcom
section to understand).  </p>

<h4>Making Libs</h4>

<p>Please read the watcom section.</p>

<h4>Optimization</h4>

<p>in LCC-WIN32 you would type <tt>'LCC -O test.c'</tt> to compile and
optimize test.c.  Probably the closest match is <tt>'GCC -O2
test.c'</tt> however DJGPP optimizes a lot better then LCC-WIN32, the
<tt>-O2</tt> generally doesn't make the code any bigger, and in fact
makes it smaller most of the time.</p>


<p>This sums up this chapter.  I wish to make ammenmants to this
section, such as better code snipets, and more detailed explanations.
