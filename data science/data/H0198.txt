<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>

<p><I>Streptococcus pyogenes</I> is a major cause of bacterial infection ranging from pharyngitis to septicemia and necrotizing fasciitis. Since the late 1980's, world-wide attention has been focused on the resurgence of severe disease caused by group A streptococci (GAS). In 1992, only 118 blood isolates were submitted to the National Centre for Streptococcus (NCS) for serotyping, however by 1995 the annual testing volume had more than tripled to 357. This likely reflects both an increase in serious disease and greater community awareness.

<p>Detection of the genes that code for the production of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (SPE) A, B and C and streptolysin O (SLO) was implemented in this laboratory in 1992. This testing was restricted to those isolates for which relevant clinical information was provided. The number of requests for this service rose from 19 in 1992 to 161 in 1995.

<p>We report the prevalence of GAS serotypes from Canadian blood isolates, and the presence of SPE and SLO genes for isolates recovered from patients with serious disease.

<p><FONT SIZE="-1"><i>ISOLATES:</i></FONT> Blood isolates recovered from 860 Canadian patients were submitted to the NCS between January 1, 1992 and December 31, 1995. Isolates were serotyped as they were received in the laboratory or maintained at -70<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>o</SUP></FONT>C in 20% skim milk until testing could be performed.

<p><FONT SIZE="-1"><i>IDENTIFICATION:</i></FONT> Confirmation of identification was based on susceptibility to bacitracin and the presence of the A group antigen. Colonial morphology and beta haemolysis were noted. Lancefield grouping and M typing were performed from heat acid extracts.

<p><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>T TYPING:</I></FONT>  Antisera were prepared in rabbits from strains obtained from the Central Public Health Laboratory in Colindale, England or from the Centres for Disease Control in Atlanta, USA. Polyvalent antisera Pools X  and Y prepared in-house contain T type 58 and T type 47 respectively in addition to those types typically contained in these T typing pools. Commercial T typing antisera available from the Institute of Public Health, Prague, Czechoslovakia were utilized to confirm multiple T type patterns. T typing was performed according to the standard agglutination method of Griffith. An overnight culture in trypsin treated Todd Hewitt broth with 2% additional neopeptone incubated at 30oC was used for the preparation of the cell suspension.

<p><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>OPACITY FACTOR:</I></FONT>  The microtechnique of Johnson et al. was used to test for the production of opacity factor (OF) with Todd Hewitt broth supernatant and heat acid extracts.

<p><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>M TYPING:</I></FONT>  Demonstration of M protein was performed by the Ouchterlony immuno-diffusion method using the heat acid extracts and absorbed antisera prepared in rabbits. The antisera panel for OF negative M types includes: 1, 3, 5, 6, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 23, 24, 26, 29, 30, 31, 33, 36, 39, 41, 43, 46, 47, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 65, 72, 74, 80 and also R3. 

<p>OF positive strains were M typed by the agar slide method of Maxted et al., using M type specific antisera to neutralize the OF present in the broth supernatant or heat acid extract. The following antisera for OF positive M types were prepared in rabbits: 2, 4, 9, 11, 13, 22, 25, 27, 28, 44, 48, 49, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 66, 68, 73, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 81, and PT2841. Antisera harvested from guinea pigs included M13, 22, 27, 28, 44, 49, 60, 66, 68, 73, 75, 76, 77, 78, 81, and PT2841. Guinea pig antisera were more antigenically active in the OF inhibition test than rabbit antisera. To enhance the detection of opacity factor for weakly OF positive strains, the cells were treated with 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate according to Rehder et al. and retested. Immuno-diffusion was performed on OF positive strains which failed to M type by the OF neutralization test. 

<p><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>EXOTOXIN TESTING:</I></FONT>  The SPE and SLO genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction using specific oligonucleotide primers as described by Tyler et al. The different sized amplicons generated were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis containing ethidium bromide and visualized under ultra violet light.

<p>Figure 1 shows the distribution by province of GAS submitted for serotyping over the study period. Strains are sent to the NCS on a voluntary basis and the distribution reflects the level of participation of each province. The largest portion of the sample was submitted from Ontario, a province with a large population and an active GAS surveillance network and in which invasive GAS is now a notifiable disease.

<p>Table 1 shows the prevalence of M types. Two types,  M1 and M3, make up 39% of our sample. This percentage is very similar to that reported for blood isolates from the United Kingdom<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT> and the United States<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT>. The association of these two M types with increasing numbers of serious invasive disease is well documented <FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1,3,4,5,6</SUP></FONT>. Over 66% of the fatal infections in one report were caused by types M1 and M3<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT>. 

<p>Type M1 was consistently the most common serotype over the four year period. Annual changes were noted for two M types. M3 has shown a steady increase representing 8.5% of the sample in 1992 compared to 19.3% in 1995. In 1995 type M6 accounted for 6.7% of the sample compared to approximately 1% in each of the first three years of the study. This type has been associated with rheumatic fever<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>4</SUP></FONT>, but we found no evidence to confirm this relationship for our strains due to incomplete clinical information.

<p>Table 2 presents the percentage of isolates in which the SPE genes were detected and their relationship with types M1 and M3, which account for over half of the 285 isolates tested.  SPE A and SPE C were detected in 46% and 27% of our isolates respectively.  All but one strain carried the SPE B gene and the genetic sequence for SLO was present in all isolates.  This is similar to the distribution of exotoxin genes reported in an earlier Canadian study<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>7</SUP></FONT>.  SPE A was detected in 98% of M1 strains, 65% of M3, and only 3.7% of the other serotypes.  SPE C was rarely seen in these two M types.  The frequency with which the SPE A gene occurs in M1 strains has been noted by others<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>2,6</SUP></FONT> and it was previously thought that this toxin played a major role in serious GAS disease<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>6</SUP></FONT>.  Clinical information received with our isolates suggests that they caused serious disease, but only 46% of our sample carried SPE A.  We believe that this toxin may be only one of many factors involved in severe GAS disease.

<H3><a name="Conclusions">Conclusions</a></H3>

<p>To our knowledge, this report represents the first published national Canadian data on GAS seroprevalence. Our statistics parallel those reported in other countries. The presence of SPE A in almost half of the strains examined appears to be related more to the serotype (M1 and M3) represented in this collection, than to the association with severe group A streptococcal disease. A Canada-wide laboratory based study of invasive group A streptococcal infection is currently underway. This study is expected to provide clinical correlations with serotype and presence of SPE genes for strains causing serious disease in our country and give accurate disease incidence information.
