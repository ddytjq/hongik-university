    <p align="left"><big>The History behind the formation of The Football Party</big></p>
    <p align="left">The idea for the formation of The Football Party was first put forward in
    my second book England, My England which was published in 1996.</p>
    <p align="left">During research into various campaigns staged by supporters groups at
    football league clubs, it quickly became clear that it was votes, not violence, which was
    the way forward for football activists. This inevitably led to speculation within the book
    about the formation of a single issue political party, The Football Party, dedicated to
    representing the rights of football fans everywhere.</p>
    <p align="left">Initially, the suggestion was that people would stand for their local
    council to give fans a say in issues that directly affected their local club. An approach
    that proved astonishingly successful in 1990, when supporters of Charlton Athletic FC
    formed &#145;The Valley Party&#146; in an, ultimately successful, campaign to get the club
    back to their spiritual home at &#145;The Valley&#146;.</p>
    <p align="left">Yet as this research continued, such was the response, it quickly became
    apparent that many supporters believed that this was an idea worth moving forward. Indeed,
    the more I thought about it, the more plausible it sounded. What finally convinced me that
    the concept of The Football Party was a sound one, was when I realised that the average
    local election generates a turnout of less that 40% and that while over 12 million people
    voted for the Tories in the 1992 general election, approximately 25 million watched the
    England v Germany semi final in Italia &#145;90. </p>
    <p align="left">As soon as England, My England was released, people began writing in to
    applaud the idea and it quickly became clear that this was something people really
    believed in. Popular opinion amongst those who wrote was that as supporters, they were
    becoming increasingly alienated and disenfranchised from the game they both loved and
    funded. The feeling that supporters were simply being regarded as nothing more than an
    asset by their clubs was becoming increasingly prevalent.</p>
    <p align="left">However, of greater concern to most people was the fact that they had no
    credible voice to represent them. Be it at their clubs or within the Football Association.
    This merely reinforced the generally held belief that supporters opinions are regarded as
    irrelevant by those who make decisions that have a direct impact on those who pay their
    money at the turnstiles. The notion that they would be able to use the most powerful
    weapon at their disposal, their vote, to change that appealed to people across the board.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><big>The Future</big></p>
    <p align="left">Whilst letters on this subject continue to arrive almost two years after
    the release of England, My England, I have always believed that the time was not quite
    right to launch The Football Party. There have been numerous reasons for this; the fact
    that I have been forging a writing career as well as working on my anti-intimidation
    campaign are just two.</p>
    <p align="left">Yet one thing changed that and I began to think that maybe now, the time
    was right to unleash the idea and see what happened. France &#145;98.</p>
    <p align="left">Unlike many involved with writing about football, I did not go to the
    World Cup in France. The reason for this was that as someone who studies the hooligansim
    issue, I believed that it was inevitable that trouble would occur in some form or another.
    I also knew, that when that happened, the media would be desperate for comment and by
    providing those comments, I could do a great deal to further my anti-intimidation
    campaign. And so it proved. In the week following the trouble in Marseilles, I gave over
    thirty television and radio interviews. Most importantly, the response to those interviews
    from amongst genuine football supporters was both astonishing and unreservedly supportive.</p>
    <p align="left">Yet despite the fact that I took part in live debates with various MP&#146;s
    from all three of the major political parties, as well as members of the Football Trust,
    the Football Task Force and senior Police officers, I heard nothing that made me believe
    that those who hold the power to make change would ever actually do anything. This, in
    turn, led to the realisation that it would take something new to force this change and
    that could, possibly, be The Football Party.</p>
    <p align="left">Ironically, just after that England&#146;s exit from the World Cup, I
    received a letter from a Tottenham Hotspurs supporter who told me about the problems that
    supporters were having at that club at that time. He wrote about the uncertainty
    surrounding the current chairman, the unhappiness with the management of the team and the
    fact that as a life long fan and season ticket holder, he felt impotent. He had written to
    me because, quite simply, there was no one else who would listen.</p>
    <p align="left">But then, right at the end of his letter, he told me to go ahead and form
    The Football Party. His reasoning was that whilst he cares about the homeless and the
    unemployed in the same way that all reasonable and compassionate people do, he cares about
    football more, because it&#146;s his. And he wants someone in authority who will listen to
    what he has to say about it.</p>
    <p align="left">I understand that perfectly because that, in a nutshell, is what The
    Football Party is all about.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><big>Short Biography of Dougie Brimson, Founder of The Football Party</big></p>
    <p align="left">The driving force behind The Football Party is best-selling author and
    broadcaster, DOUGIE BRIMSON.</p>
    <p align="left">Born in 1959, Dougie left school at sixteen and enlisted in the Royal Air
    Force where he trained as a mechanical engineer.</p>
    <p align="left">After basic training at RAF St Athan in South Wales, Dougie went on to
    complete over eighteen years service with the RAF rising to the rank of Sergeant. During
    his service career, he worked with the Harrier force in Germany, served on Ascension
    Island during the Falklands conflict and played a significant role in the supply of
    aircraft servicing equipment during the Gulf War. He also served in numerous overseas
    locations in support of RAF operations.</p>
    <p align="left">In 1994, following the second round of redundancies amongst HM Forces,
    Dougie left the RAF with an exemplary service record and began a career as a writer.</p>
    <p align="left">His first book, co-written with his brother, Eddy, was entitled Everywhere
    We Go and was an examination of football supporters and the culture of the terraces. It
    was an immediate best-seller and was quickly followed up with <a
    href="../shop/ourgame/englandmyengland.htm">England, My England</a> which examined the
    history of hooliganism involving England supporters abroad.</p>
    <p align="left">Two further books followed, Capital Punishment and <a
    href="../shop/ourgame/derbydays.htm">Derby Days</a>, both of which examined further
    aspects of the terrace culture. All four books have been astonishingly successful both in
    Britain and abroad. This success has established Dougie as one of the leading experts in
    the field of hooliganism and the culture of football and he is in constant demand by the
    media to discuss and comment on issues related to the game.</p>
    <p align="left">Dougie is however, more widely known amongst football supporters for his
    passionate and widely praised campaign to rid the game of intimidation. A campaign which
    encompasses both anti-violence and anti-racism and which has received a tremendous amount
    of support from supporters throughout Britain.</p>
    <p align="left">It is the continuing drive toward the success of this campaign, coupled
    with the desire to see the rights of football fans properly recognised, that is the key
    reason for the formation of The Football Party.</p>
    <p align="left">Dougie is married to Tina and has three children.</p>
