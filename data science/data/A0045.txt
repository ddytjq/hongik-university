        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>BACKGROUND</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Northern Rock plc 
          will shortly be meeting analysts ahead of its close period for the six 
          months ending 30 June 2002. This announcement details the information 
          that will be provided at those meetings.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OVERVIEW</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Northern Rock's 
          strategy is one of growth in good quality lending, centred around home 
          ownership. Lending growth generates income growth and drives down unit 
          costs. Funding is generated from a <br>
          well-balanced franchise of retail deposits, wholesale funds and mortgage-backed 
          securities. Effective use of new technologies helps to improve capacity, 
          enhance distribution and reduce marginal costs - all of which benefits 
          customers and intermediaries and maintains Northern Rock's cost efficiency 
          leadership within the sector.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>ECONOMIC BACKGROUND 
          AND MARKET OUTLOOK</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Economic forecasts 
          continue to predict a gentle slowdown in 2002 and modest recovery in 
          2003. The housing market remains both large and robust: affordability 
          and consumer confidence are good. A slowdown in house price growth is 
          anticipated as interest rates and unemployment begin to rise, which 
          should help to keep affordability within long term trend levels.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Current forecasts 
          for mortgage lending in the UK for 2002 predict strong volumes. This 
          should, naturally, help our performance. A slower housing market will 
          not disrupt our high growth story, which is underpinned by our increasing 
          cost advantage. This will continue to be a differentiating factor for 
          Northern Rock compared to the rest of the mortgage market.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>LENDING</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lending has been 
          strong in all areas with our share of net residential lending in line 
          with achieving at least twice &quot;par&quot; levels. Our total net 
          lending is up by over 50% compared to last year. We have seen a notable 
          increase in re-mortgaging business as borrowers are leaving their existing 
          lenders to enjoy the more attractive products offered by Northern Rock. 
          The pipeline of agreed business has increased to &pound;3.5 billion 
          (cf. &pound;3.3 billion as at end Q1 2002) ensuring solid lending momentum 
          going forward. Our transparent and equitable policy of allowing existing 
          customers to have any product available to new customers has helped 
          to see our share of residential redemptions stay well below our natural 
          share.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The quality of our 
          loan books remains strong. Our residential lending arrears are less 
          than half the industry average, and the absolute number of cases 3 months 
          or more in arrears has fallen from 2,525 at the end of 2001 to 2,433 
          as at the end of April 2002. The credit quality of all other forms of 
          lending (i.e. commercial, unsecured and credit cards) is also good. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>FUNDING</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Funding from all 
          our three sources (i.e. retail, wholesale and securitisation) has been 
          well-balanced and strong.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Retail intake has 
          been positive, supported by fixed rate bonds, on-line tracker products 
          and cash ISA sales; and retail balances - which are expected to grow 
          by around &pound;600 million during H1 2002 - still fund about 50% of 
          our balance sheet assets.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We continue to take 
          advantage of wholesale funding and securitisation. On the wholesale 
          front, with the expectation of interest rate rises, we have moved to 
          more medium term funding and swaps to protect our fixed rate lending 
          exposure to such increases. We are at the forefront in the UK market 
          in residential mortgage-backed securities and so far this year we have 
          already issued &pound;2.4 billion of securitised notes - placed in Sterling, 
          Euro and US Dollar markets - setting new benchmark levels which reflect 
          the high quality of our assets.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>OPERATING PERFORMANCE</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Spreads and margins 
          have remained relatively stable during the first five months of 2002. 
          As expected, greater use of securitisation and Libor increases will 
          have a modest, adverse effect on spreads. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are very successful 
          at up-selling products to our customer base, and anticipate that our 
          growth in Other Income will exceed our Balance Sheet growth. Through 
          a combination of relatively stable margins and high trading volumes, 
          we expect total income growth to be comfortably within our low-to-mid 
          teens range at the half year stage.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>COSTS</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cost efficiency 
          is a key focus for Northern Rock. Our strategic target is to restrict 
          cost growth to between one half to two thirds of the growth in assets 
          under management and less than income growth. With cost growth at the 
          low to mid point of our strategic range, we will see a further reduction 
          in both unit cost ratios at the half year stage.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the same time, 
          we continue to invest to support the Company's high growth strategy. 
          A &pound;50 million expansion of the Head Office site in Gosforth will 
          accommodate future growth in capacity and improve service to both customers 
          and intermediaries. This, in turn, should bring about further improvements 
          in our unit cost ratios.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>PROVISIONS</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The quality of our 
          lending has been strong. Our arrears continue to improve and provisioning 
          remains prudent. A key feature has been the cautious volume-driven increase 
          in Unsecured Lending provisioning.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>PROFITS</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The range of those 
          pre-tax profit forecasts which reflect the new accounting treatment 
          of Reserve Capital Instruments is &pound;309m to &pound;321m (2001: 
          &pound;276.5m). We anticipate profit growth to be around the mid-teens 
          for 2002 and are, therefore, comfortable with the top end of that range. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>COMMENT</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adam J Applegarth, 
          Chief Executive commented: &quot;Northern Rock's lending performance 
          in the first five months of 2002 has been very strong. We are ahead

        <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>NORTHERN 
          ROCK Q1 TRADING STATEMENT</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Northern Rock takes 
          the opportunity to inform the market of its current strong trading performance; 
          particularly that its record lending in 2001 has continued throughout 
          Q1 2002 and is also expected to be strong in Q2 2002. This performance 
          is in line with its strategic intention of taking a market share for 
          the current year of net residential lending of 7-8%, around twice its 
          natural share of stock, which was 3.8% at 1 January 2002. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Lending</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Compared to the 
          first quarter of 2001, total gross lending and total net lending have 
          both increased by more than 35%, with net residential lending higher 
          by more than 55%. Northern Rock starts Q2 with a pipeline of agreed 
          business of over &pound;3.3 billion - 50% higher than at the same time 
          last year. Redemptions have continued to run noticeably lower than natural 
          share, a reflection in part of the transparency of new customers' products 
          being available to all existing mortgagors.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mortgage arrears 
          - including Together loans - continue to be tightly controlled and the 
          level of arrears at more than three months duration remains below half 
          the industry average. Unsecured personal loans and the secured commercial 
          portfolio are also performing well. Northern Rock has no residential 
          loan exposure outside the UK nor any exposure to unsecured corporate 
          lending or leasing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Funding</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Funding has been 
          well-balanced and strong. Wholesale monies and the growth in personal 
          savings have both been positive and have met expectations; and, in addition, 
          during March Northern Rock successfully completed its sixth securitisation 
          transaction raising &pound;2.4 billion. Notes were placed in Sterling, 
          Euro and, benefiting from SEC registration, the US Dollar markets, in 
          line with the Company's objectives and retaining its position at the 
          forefront of securitisation of residential mortgages in the UK.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Costs</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cost control remains 
          a key focus for Northern Rock and cost growth is within the Company's 
          strategic target of being less than total income growth and between 
          one half to two thirds of the rate in asset growth. This ensures unit 
          costs continue to fall.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Accounting for 
          Reserve Capital Instruments (&quot;RCIs&quot;)</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The current range 
          of market expectations of pre-tax profit for 2002 is &pound;310m to 
          &pound;342m. This does not reflect the recent required change to the 
          accounting treatment for RCIs following the introduction of UITF 33, 
          the effect of which will be to marginally enhance our profit attributable 
          to shareholders, return on equity and earnings per share but will reduce 
          our profit before tax. This is because the coupons for our RCIs (adjusted 
          for grossing up of tax and the Foundation covenant) will be treated 
          as a pre, not post, tax deduction.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After adjusting 
          for the new accounting treatment for RCIs, Northern Rock remains comfortable 
          with market consensus profit expectations. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Economic Background 
          &amp; Market Outlook</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Affordability remains 
          at sustainable levels given the UK economy as a whole. The housing market 
          remains both large and robust and the mortgage market - especially with 
          the opportunity to remortgage at relatively low interest rates - is 
          set to be sufficiently large for Northern Rock to achieve its lending 
          targets. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the medium term, 
          signs of a modestly slowing economy may have an impact on housing demand, 
          but this should be offset by a combination of a shortage of new housing 
          and historically low interest rates. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Comment</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adam J Applegarth, 
          Chief Executive, commented: &quot;Operating performance in the first 
          quarter of the year continues to be very good. It is in line with expectations 
          and builds on the strong progress we made in 2001. We are set to deliver 
          against our low cost, high growth strategy.&quot;</font></p>

          A further pre-close period announcement will be made towards the end 
          of May and a more detailed report on Northern Rock's performance will

        <p align="center"> <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NORTHERN ROCK PRE CLOSE PERIOD ANALYST MEETINGS</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Background</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Northern Rock plc will shortly be meeting analysts ahead of its close period for the twelve months ending 31 December 2001.  This announcement details the information that will be provided at those meetings.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Overview</b> 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Northern Rock's virtuous circle strategy uses our low cost operations along with product innovation, technology and customer friendly distribution to produce good products at competitive prices.  This leads to strong growth in high quality assets to provide low risk, attractive returns to shareholders.  This strategy seems especially valid in current market conditions.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Operating performance for the year is at the top of the range of expectations, building on the strong progress made in 2000.  Financial results are also anticipated to be in line with our operational performance and we therefore remain comfortable that we will achieve results at the top end of the consensus range; (PBT Range &#163;282m to &#163;294m based on current published estimates from 14 major analysts).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Lending</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lending volumes have been good in all areas, with net lending up over 40% year to date compared to the same period last year, delivering a share of net residential lending on target at around twice "par" levels.  The level of mortgage business at Northern Rock has remained strong throughout 2001.  Enquiries for Northern Rock products have remained buoyant in October and November.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within residential lending we have further strengthened our product range with the launch of <I>together connections</I> - an off-setting variation of <I>together</I>.   This product is proving attractive to customers and the together family of products continues to perform well in comparison to more traditional type loans.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The improved lending and product mix has allowed the average cost of acquisition to continue to fall despite high volume growth.  New loan business volumes are strong with a pipeline of &#163;2.4 billion of agreed, but not yet completed, loans at the end of November, compared to &#163;1.9 billion at the end of December last year.  Our transparent and fair policy of allowing existing customers to have any product available to new customers has helped to see our share of residential redemptions stay well beneath our natural share</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Arrears and Provisions</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The quality of our lending remains good with arrears in residential lending remaining at less than half the industry average. We see no current deterioration in credit quality in our residential, secured commercial or unsecured personal loan books - with the absolute number of arrears at the end of 2001 set to finish lower than the end of last year.  Naturally, therefore, arrears as a proportion of the number of loans has also fallen substantially.  As a result of the uncertainties created by recent events and the deteriorating outlook for the world economy, including the UK, we have prudently decided that we will increase certain provisions for the current financial year.  This also reflects the higher volumes of business we have generated as a result of our additional growth this year.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Treasury</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Northern Rock's Treasury function acts as an integrated part of the business not as a separate profit centre.  Over 96% of our Liquid Assets are invested in Investments grade A or better.  The quality of this portfolio is illustrated by the fact that we have no exposure to ENRON the US Energy Company</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Funding</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Funding from all areas has grown and continued to diversify.  Retail balances still fund 50% of balance sheet assets.  We continue to take advantage of wholesale funding and securitisation opportunities.  We have issued &#163;3 billion of securitised notes during 2001, and retain our position at the forefront of securitisation of residential mortgages in the UK.  Retail intake has been good, supported by fixed rate bonds and Cash ISA sales, allowing further selling opportunities.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Total net funding in 2001 will be around &#163;6 billion.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Operating Performance</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Spreads and margins have benefited both from lower loan acquisition costs and from lower base rates and therefore are better than predicted at the half year.  As a result of higher total income margins and incremental volumes, total income growth will be in excess of our mid-teens target.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Costs</b> 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We continue to invest for growth.  Cost growth is expected to be below the mid point of our target range of half to two thirds of growth of assets under management and is also set to be less than income growth.  We expect both unit cost ratios to show improvement.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>E-Commerce</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Northern Rock's integrated e-commerce platform continues to show substantial progress in generating further business volumes and supporting our aim of driving down unit costs.  So far this year, around 10% of all loans by value were originated from this source.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Economic Background and Market Outlook</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The UK economy is expected to see growth slow to around the 2% level next year.  Whilst unemployment is set to rise, interest rates are at a 40 year low, meaning that affordability indices are well within their long term sustainable trend bands and are around half the levels seen at the start of the 1990s.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prospects for house price increases have moderated and are at levels sustainable given the UK economy as a whole.  The housing market remains both large and robust and the mortgage market - especially with the opportunity to remortgage at very low interest rates - is set to be sufficiently large for Northern Rock to achieve our strategic target levels of lending.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><I>Summary</I></b> </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><I>Northern Rock has delivered against its strategy in 2001 and is set to continue to do so.</I></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further, more detailed, information on our 2001 trading performance will be provided at the time of the preliminary results - to be announced on Wednesday 30 January 2002.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><I>Comment</I></b> </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><I>Adam Applegarth, Chief Executive, said "Northern Rock's performance is very strong and on target.  The future prospects for our strategy (of good lending growth feeding through to strong financial performance) continue to be attractive".</I></font></p>

        <p align="center"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NORTHERN 
          ROCK Q3 TRADING STATEMENT</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Northern Rock announces 
          that its buoyant lending performance of the first half of 2001 has continued 
          in Q3 and is also set to be strong in Q4. This is in keeping with the 
          strategic target of having a market share of new residential lending 
          at twice natural share of stock.<br>
          Northern Rock remains comfortable with the top end of market expectations 
          of profit performance, with total income margins remaining stable, as 
          seen during H1.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Lending</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Total gross lending 
          was 67% higher and net lending more than double in Q3 than the same 
          quarter last year. This resulted in a 43% increase in net lending for 
          the year to the end of Q3 compared to the same period last year. Northern 
          Rock starts Q4 with a pipeline of agreed business of over &pound;2.2 
          billion - 34% higher than the same time last year. <br>
          Redemptions continued to run noticeably lower than natural share, a 
          reflection in part of the transparency of new customers' products being 
          available to existing customers.<br>
          Credit quality remains extremely robust across all forms of Northern 
          Rock's lending, with no signs of deterioration. Arrears in residential 
          lending remain under half the industry average. Northern Rock, of course, 
          has no residential loan exposure outside the UK nor exposure to unsecured 
          corporate lending or leasing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Funding</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All three funding 
          arms - retail, wholesale, and securitisation - have performed well. 
          The latest tranche of securitisation - &pound;1&frac12; billion of which 
          almost two thirds was in US Dollars - was completed last week - a reflection 
          of not only the credit quality of Northern Rock's loans but also the 
          ability of financial markets to recover and the desire for this type 
          of asset-backed financial instrument.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Costs</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cost control remains 
          strong, and cost growth is within the Company's strategic target of 
          less than two thirds of the rate of asset growth. This ensures unit 
          costs continue to fall. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Market Outlook</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The level of mortgage 
          enquiries at Northern Rock has remained strong over the last 3 weeks 
          - despite recent events. Lower interest rates directly help loan repayment 
          abilities, and contribute to maintaining momentum in the economy generally. 
          <br>
          In the medium term, it may be that weaker consumer confidence feeds 
          through to the housing market. This should mean a rate of growth in 
          the housing market more in keeping with that of the economy as a whole. 
          This should prevent affordability indices moving to unmaintainable levels 
          and therefore create a more sustainable housing market. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>General Outlook</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adam Applegarth, 
          Chief Executive commented: &quot;Northern Rock, with our narrow lending 
          focus in the UK, does not face some of the credit quality questions 
          seen by banks with wider activities. The housing market may see some 
          of its froth disappear - a good thing to happen before the general market 
          became unsustainable. The outlook for the mortgage market is good enough 
          for Northern Rock - the most cost efficient bank - to achieve our strategic 
          goals. In difficult times, Northern Rock is well placed to continue 
          to prosper&quot;.</font></p>

          should be read in conjunction with our announcement for the half year

          of 1995 with respect to certain of the plans of Northern Rock, its current 
          goals and expectations relating to its future financial condition and 
          performance. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk 
          and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances 
          that will occur in the future. Northern Rock's actual future results 
          may differ materially from the results expressed or implied in these 
          forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including 
          UK domestic and global economic and business conditions, market related 
          risks such as interest rates and exchange rates, delays in implementing 
          proposals, unexpected difficulties with computer systems, unexpected 
          changes to regulation, changes in customer preferences, competition 
          and other factors. Please refer to the most recent Annual Report on 
          Form 20F of Northern Rock filed with the US Securities and Exchange

          ROCK PRE CLOSE PERIOD ANALYST MEETINGS</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Background</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Northern Rock plc 
          will shortly be meeting analysts ahead of its close period for the six 
          months ending 30 June 2001. This announcement details the information 
          that will be provided at those meetings. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Overview</b> 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Northern Rock's 
          strategy is one of high quality growth in lending - mainly residential. 
          This growth in lending generates other income growth as well as driving 
          down unit costs. Effective use of new technologies helps to improve 
          capacity, reduce marginal costs as well as enhancing distribution. Funding 
          comes from a well-balanced franchise of retail deposits, wholesale funds 
          and mortgage backed securities. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Operating performance 
          in the first half of the year is in line with expectations, building 
          on the strong progress made in 2000. Results for the first half of 2001 
          are anticipated to be in line with our expectations and we remain comfortable 
          with market forecasts for the full year. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Lending</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Northern Rock's 
          strong performance has continued into 2001 in line with the company's 
          strategy. Lending has been strong in all areas, with our share of net 
          residential lending around twice "par" levels. Within residential lending 
          we have further strengthened our product range with the launch of <i>together 
          connections</i>. Initial indications are that this product is proving 
          very attractive to our customers and the <i>together</i> family of products 
          continues to perform well in comparison to traditional loans. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The improved lending 
          and product mix has allowed the average cost of acquisition to continue 
          to fall despite strong growth. The quality of our lending remains strong 
          and provisioning remains prudent.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Funding</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Funding in all areas 
          has grown and continued to diversify. Retail balances still fund 50% 
          of our balance sheet assets: however, as we grow, we continue to take 
          advantage of wholesale funding and securitisation opportunities. We 
          have issued a further &#163;1.5 billion of securitised notes in the first 
          half of 2001, and retain our position at the forefront of securitisation 
          of residential mortgages in the UK. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Operating Performance</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Total income margin 
          to balance sheet assets remains stable for the year. Costs remain tightly 
          controlled and this will be reflected in our ratios. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Capital Efficiency</b> 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Capital continues 
          to be managed efficiently with a further issue of &#163;100m of Reserve Capital 
          Instruments in the first half of the year, to add to the &#163;200m placement 
          last year. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>E-Commerce</b> 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Northern Rock's 
          integrated e-commerce platform continues to show substantial progress. 
          Continued development throughout this year will generate further business 
          volumes and support our aim of continuously striving to drive down unit 
          costs. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Summary</b> </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Northern Rock is 
          set to continue to deliver against its strategy. Further, more detailed, 
          evidence will be provided at the time of the Interim results - to be 
          announced on Thursday 19 July.</font></p>

          GENERAL MEETING STATEMENT</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Northern 
          Rock plc takes the opportunity to inform the market of its current trading 
          performance, in substantially the same terms as The Chairman will be 
          informing shareholders at today's Annual General Meeting. 
        <p>During the first quarter of 2001, Northern Rock's trading performance 
          has continued to be very strong. All forms of lending, residential, 
          commercial and personal credit are performing well and in line with 
          the Company's growth strategy.
        <p>Our lending is comfortably ahead of the trading volumes seen in the 
          corresponding period of 2000. Indeed, net lending at the 
          end of the first quarter 2001 is 25% higher than the corresponding period 
          last year, reflecting the strong pipeline of new business carried into 
          this year. New residential applications in the first quarter are showing 
          a 24% increase over the equivalent period last year, which itself was 
          buoyant. The pipeline of applications and uncompleted awards has risen 
          to &#163;2.2 billion at the end of March 2001. It is expected that net residential 
          lending market share in the first quarter will be double the Company's 
          share of outstanding stock. Mortgage arrears continue to be tightly 
          controlled and the level of arrears of more than 3 months duration remains 
          at half the industry average.
        <p>Levels of service throughout the Company remain strong. The Decision 
          Call Centre, set up last year to improve the efficiency of mortgage 
          application processing, guarantees qualifying loan awards within service 
          turnaround standards. Our E-Commerce operation continues to contribute 
          significantly - and effectively - to the trading performance.</p>
        <p>Funding has been well balanced and strong. Wholesale monies and the 
          growth in personal savings have met expectations and in addition during 
          March Northern Rock successfully completed its fourth securitisation 
          transaction raising &#163;1.5 billion. Notes were placed in both the Sterling 
          and, benefiting from SEC registration, the US Dollar markets, in 
          line with the Company's objectives.
        <p>Adam Applegarth, Chief Executive, said:
        <p>"Northern Rock is performing well and is set to continue to deliver 
          its low cost, good quality, high growth strategy. We remain comfortable 
          with Analysts' expectations of Northern Rock for 2001."

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Overview</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Northern 
          Rock's strategy is one of high quality growth in lending - mainly residential. 
          This growth in lending generates other income growth as well as driving 
          down unit costs. Effective use of new technologies helps to improve 
          capacity, reduce marginal costs as well as enhancing distribution.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Funding 
          comes from a well-balanced franchise of retail deposits, wholesale funds 
          and mortgage backed securities.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Operating 
          performance in the second half is in line with expectations, building 
          on the company's first half achievements. The 2000 financial results 
          are anticipated to be in line with our expectations and we are comfortable 
          with market forecasts.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Lending</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Northern 
          Rock's strong performance has continued in the second half of the year 
          and the year as a whole has been consistent with its strategy.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lending 
          has been strong in all areas, with net lending expected to be roughly 
          double 1999's total and net residential lending around twice "par". 
          Within residential lending the Together product has proved very attractive 
          to customers and these loans have continued to perform well in comparison 
          to traditional loans. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          improved lending and product mix has allowed the average cost of acquisition 
          to continue to fall despite strong growth. The quality of our lending 
          remains strong and provisioning remains prudent.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Funding</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Funding 
          in all areas has grown and continued to diversify. Having become an 
          SEC reporting company, Northern Rock has a strong platform to ensure 
          international geographic diversification of funding sources continues. 
          Retail funding will again show sensible growth in both halves of the 
          year. Securitisation issues now total &#163;2.65bn with the latest issue 
          (3rd) being more representative of the book as a whole. Northern Rock 
          is - and intends to remain - at the forefront of securitisation of residential 
          mortgages in the UK.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Operating 
          Performance</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Total 
          income margin to balance sheet assets remains stable for the year.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Costs 
          - which include strong investment in emerging technology - remain tightly 
          controlled and this will be reflected in the cost ratios.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Published 
          post-tax profits will benefit from the inclusion of the "one off" &#163;10m 
          tax credit relating to previously disallowed conversion costs.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Capital 
          Efficiency</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Capital 
          continues to be managed efficiently with two capital issues having been 
          effected this year, a &#163;200m Reserve Capital Instrument and a &#163;40m Tier 
          2 placement.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>E-Commerce</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Northern 
          Rock's integrated e-commerce platform continues to show substantial 
          progress. The next stages - with the earlier moves being about expanding 
          distribution to customers - are concentrating on further ties with intermediaries 
          and reducing transaction costs.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Summary</b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A renewed 
          Northern Rock is set to continue to deliver against its strategy. Further, 
          more detailed, evidence will be provided at the time of the preliminary

          ROCK SPRING STATEMENT </font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Northern 
          Rock has made significant progress in the first quarter of the year. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All 
          lending is on target with residential mortgage lending particularly 
          buoyant. In the first three months, residential net lending was more 
          than double 1999's figure, reflecting a very strong gross completions 
          performance. This will translate into an estimated market share for 
          UK net residential lending over twice the Company's natural share. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Equally 
          encouraging was that the level of new residential awards was also almost 
          twice last year's level. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          good progress has resulted from the successful implementation of the 
          Company's new hi-tech Decision Call Centre, increased volumes via the 
          internet and the wide appeal of "together", the Company's innovative 
          combined credit product. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Plans 
          to combine all technological distribution channels are on target. Already 
          15% of all residential and 83% of personal credit applications are originated 
          through the Company's integrated site. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leo 
          Finn, Chief Executive, commented: <i>&quot;We promised a strong start 
          to the year which has been delivered. We are convinced that e-commerce 
          integration is the key and thus far our results support our contention.</i></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;We 
          intend to follow this path rapidly. Our aim is to continue to reduce 
          our already very low unit costs. I believe that low cost multi-channel 
          delivery is a winning strategy giving customers transparency, comparison 
          and choice.&quot; </i></font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>E-Commerce 
          Strategy: </b>Northern Rock's e-commerce strategy has two prongs. The 
          first is to offer products directly to customers with customer choice 
          being the key. The various distribution channels - branch, telephone, 
          post and e-commerce - are being developed as an integrated service, 
          with NR Direct and northernrock.com as a single integrated site. All 
          products already have on-line applications and by the end of 2000 all 
          will be fully transactional. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Northern 
          Rock sees digital TV as both a future major driver in accessing direct 
          customers and keeping down unit costs. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          second prong of e-commerce is through &quot;Business to Business&quot;, 
          in particular to both the existing and new generation of loan intermediaries 
          and information providers, as well as for resource purchasing and hence 
          cost management. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Decision 
          Call Centre:</b> Launched in mid February. Provides on-line guaranteed 
          loan decisions to intermediaries who account for around 60% of Northern 
          Rock's residential loan business. This is the largest automated call 
          centre in the UK to support national intermediaries. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The

          by an economically appropriate mix of personal savings, wholesale funds

          to grow the business further and gives better returns to shareholders.

            intends to introduce, subject to regulatory approval, a <b>rolling 
            share buy-back programme</b>, to commence after the release of its 
            1999 financial results. Further details of this programme - estimated 
            at up to &#163;150m in 2000 - will be contained in the results announcement 
            for the 1999 financial year, which is expected to be made on 26 January 
            2000. </font></li>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mr Finn concluded: 
          "Our performance to date in the second half of this year is very encouraging. 
          For example, in terms of mortgage applications, in the second half of 
          1999 we are running 85% ahead of the same period last year. A good deal 
          of those applications will complete this year, with the rest ensuring 
          we start the New Year strongly. <b>The early signs of success of our 
          renewal programme are already showing</b>."</font></p>
