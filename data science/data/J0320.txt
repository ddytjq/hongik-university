      Citrus Gearing Up For Winter Spectacular II<br>
      &nbsp;(Inverness, Fl. 1/12/02)&nbsp; Just four more work days before the
      new<br>
      playing field at Citrus County Speedway has to be ready for the two day<br>
      practice, tuning and testing session, and then the big, six feature<br>
      event in Winter Spectacular II takes off on Saturday January 19th 2002.<br>
      &nbsp;Promoters Billy Hooker and Jimmy Wear were in the center of
      activity,<br>
      heading up the work crew Saturday putting the final touches on the new<br>
      back stretch expansion.<br>
      The back straight has been expanded from 41 ft. to 63 ft. wide, turning<br>
      the outside groove into a 3/8th mile racetrack.&nbsp; The tuning and
      testing<br>
      session from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Thursday and Friday nights will give<br>
      all the drivers, in all divisions, the opportunity to answer a lot of<br>
      unanswered questions. What is it going to take to master the new<br>
      pavement? How are the Goodyear tires going to work on the new playing<br>
      field? What is the right tire pressure, and answer the big questions of<br>
      what gear to use and how to change the stager and set up. It's a whole<br>
      new ball game on a very different playing field. It would appear no one<br>
      will have an advantage in pursuit of the $5,000 win purse in the all<br>
      green racing, 100 lap Late Model Special.<br>
      &nbsp;Not only has the racetrack been expanded in size but new bleachers
      are<br>
      being set up in the pits. A new exit road allows for departure from the<br>
      track off turn two. There has been new lighting installed on the back<br>
      chute which really makes a difference. The access road to the track from<br>
      the pits has also been restructured to allow for safer entrance to the<br>
      racetrack from the pits.<br>
      &nbsp;Late Model time trials get underway at 4 p.m. Saturday.
      Approximately<br>
      30 of Florida's best are expected to attempt to qualify for the 24<br>
      starting spots in the 100 lap special. Seventeen cars will qualify in<br>
      time trials, with a fifteen lap consolation race setting up the next<br>
      seven starting positions with the final two positions being a promoters<br>
      choice.<br>
      Balancing out the program will be the Sportsman, Street Stocks, Mini<br>
      Stocks, Hobby Stocks, and Thunder Stocks running in 30 lap features.<br>
      Citrus County Speedway's 2002 regular season opens up February 9th and<br>
      continues through March 2nd when the track will be shut down for three<br>
      weeks for the Citrus County Fair activities.&nbsp; Racing resumes on March<br>
      30th with the Sunbelt Series plus a full race card and continues on a<br>
      weekly program through November 16th 2002. All regular divisions will<br>
      run at least 5 specials during the year for bigger purses.&nbsp; Regular
      race<br>
      cards will feature Late Models, Sportsman, Street Stocks, Mini Stocks,<br>
      Hobby Stocks and Thunder Stocks running in heat and features. Figure 8's<br>
      are also on the schedule for the year plus several other specials to be<br>
      announced at a later date.<br>
