<p><a name="C10"><font face="Arial"><b><i>1</i></b></font></a><font
face="Arial"><b><i>. The forelimb movements of the tree-mounting
prebirds.<br>
</i></b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The forelimb
movements of the climbing pre-birds are homologous with the
flapping movements of flying birds and thus a pre-requisite of
flapping flight.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">According to the proposed theory
the climbing pre-birds by mounting as well as by descending, step
by step, simultaneously had to perform two kinds of movements by
each forelimbs:</font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">An embracing grip-movement
        by which the outstretched forelimbs, retaining the
        hooking grip, were carried simultaneously to the rear.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">A recovery movement by which
        the forelimbs released the hooking grip and in a fast
        forward swing carried the forearms forward to take a new
        grip. </font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In details these movements might
be described like this:</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>1. The grip movement:<br>
</b>A1<sup>o</sup>. The entire forelimb is moved ventrally,
pressing the hand against the tree-trunk. This movemet is
performed by the pectoralis major muscles, depressing the humeri.
<br>
The lower arm is bend laterally anteriorly, a movement performed
by the biceps brachii muscles, flexing the elbow. The hand is
bend laterally posteriorly in the wrist.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">A2<sup>o</sup>. The entire
forelimb is still pressed against the tree-trunk and carried to
the rear as the pre-bird descends. The upperarm is turned
laterally rearwards in the shoulderjoint, a movement performed by
the latissimus dorsi muscle.<br>
The lower arm is gradually outstretched as the elbow-joint,
flexed by the biceps brachii muscle opens, which movement is
performed by the triceps brachii muscle. The hand is still flexed
laterally in the wrist.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>2. The recovery movemet:<br>
</b>A3<sup>o</sup>. The hooking of the forelimb claws is released
by a slight stretching of the elbow, performed by the triceps
brachii muscle and by a lateral stretching of the wrist.
Immediately thereafter the entire forelimb is elevated - i.e.
moved dorsally - by the deltoid muscles.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">A4<sup>o</sup>. The released and
elevated forelimb is swung in anterior direction by the
supracoracoideus muscle. During this swing the lower arm is bend
laterally forward by a flex of the elbow, performed by the biceps
brachii muscle, and the hand is bend laterally in ulnar direction
by a flex of the wrist.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">A5<sup>o</sup>. The entire
forelimb is moved towards the tree-trunk and pressed against it
by a ventral movement performed by the pectoralis major muscle.
At the same time the forearm and the hand is laterally
outstretched by an opening of the elbow, performed by triceps
brachii muscle and a laterally opening of the wrist.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">A6<sup>o</sup>. The embracing
grip of the forelimbs is restored by a ventral movement of the
entire arm, performed by pectoralis major muscle. The hooking of
the claws of the digits is restablished by a flex of the elbow,
performed by the biceps brachii muscle.</font></p>

<p><a name="C20"><font face="Arial"><b><i>2</i></b></font></a><font
face="Arial"><b><i>. The jump-descent.<br>
</i></b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The descent of the
climbing pre-bird was surely performed in the head-down manner,
known from modern tree-dwelling reptiles and squirrels. The
forlimb movement might then have been in essence performed as
described above. During the descent the pre-bird had to adher to
the tree-trunk by the claws of the reversed first toes.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This manner of descent might not
have been performed without the danger of loosing the grip and
falling head-down to the ground, which might cost severe injury. <br>
<i>The value of adapting to a safe manner of descent therefore
was great, and the evolutionary motivation equally high.</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">A relatively simple manner of
improving the descent of the climbing pre-birds was to jump a
part of the way down from the side of the cycadoid-trunk in such
a way that the impact of the jump could be buffered by
outstretched hindlimbs. See fig. 12.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This manner of jump-descent
should be performed as a vertical onset by the hindlimbs, as two
movements performed at the same time:</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">B1<sup>o</sup>. A fierce
extention of the hip-joints by a strong backward pull of the
femurs. This movement rotated the entire body at the hip-joints
and throwed the forepart of the body outwards and upwards and
thus made the body-axis perform a rotation in the vertical plane.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">B2<sup>o</sup>. The knee- and
angle joints were fiercely extended which movement threw the
entire body horizontaly outwards from the side of the tree-trunk.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">B3<sup>o</sup>. At the same
moment as these hindlimb movements, the pre-bird released the
hooking grip of the forelimbs by outstretching and performing a
fierce ventral pull by the forelimbs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The latter movement which pressed
the forelimbs against the tree-trunk, also threw the forepart of
the body horizontally outwards. This movement is performed by the
pectoralis major muscles, and thus has a character of a
down-stroke, relatively to the body-axis.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The united effect of these
movements performed a rotation of the body, the more efficient
the movements, the greater chance of the down-jumping pre-bird to
hit the ground feet first.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">By this manner of jump-descent
the last part of the jump was performed by an oblique direction
of the body-axis with the head upward.</font></p>

the characteristics of a simultaneously rotated forelimb
flapping, consisting of fierce downstrokes and fast recovery
strokes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The downstrokes performed with
outstretched forelimbs by pectoralis major muscles and the

</i></b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The concept of
flight should be distinguised in two theoretical elements: the
elevation and the thrust which should be dealt with as gradually
evolved capacities.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">A problem of explaining the
origin of flight is that this manner of locomotion is considered
as an either/or- sort of problem, not as a more/less-problem.
That is to say that an animal either can fly or it cannot. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is the general explanation
that the ability of flight evolved gradually through stages of
parachuting - gliding - powered, i.e. flapping flight (e.g
Heilmann, 1926; Savile, 1962; Bock, 1965 and subsequent papers;
Feduccia, 1980; </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Such a concept is, however,
inconsistent with the general accepted principles of the
evolution as a gradual, continuous improvement of previously
evolved characters.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is the general explanation
that the ability of flight evolved gradually through stages of
parachuting - gliding - powered, i.e. flapping flight (e.g
Heilmann, 1926; Savile, 1962; Bock, 1965 and subsequent papers;
Feduccia, 1980; Norberg, 1985) which stages by analogies from
recent fauna are thought to represent stages of increasing
ability to flight (e.g. Abel, 1912; Oliver, 1951).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>The evolutionary origin of the
ability of flight in birds might, however, be regarded on another
concept which is based on two theoretically distinguished
elements of avian flight: </i></font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The elevation</b>, i.e.
        the ability to counteract the power of gravity which
        inflicts on the body when it is situated in the open
        space, and</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The thrust</b>, i.e. the
        ability to propell in the space without any firm
        connection with the ground.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The evolution of these two
elements are theoretically dealt with separately.</font></p>

<p><a name="C41"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>1</b></font></a><font
face="Times New Roman"><b>. The elevation.<br>
</b>Fully developed the elevation is an ability deliberately to
counteract the force of gravitation to such a degree that the
bird is able to stay unsupported in the space for a period.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Developed to only a lesser degree
this ability does not enable the bird -or pre-bird - to stay in
the space for considerable periods, but enables it to reduce the
velocity of a fall.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">A further development enables the
bird to lift from its actual level, whether this is on the ground
or in the space.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The elevating ability might,
consequently, be comprehended as continuously evolved through the
following stages:</font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">No ability to reduce the
        velocity of a free fall from a level.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Some ability deliberately to
        reduce the velocity of a free fall.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">The ability to stay
        unsupported at a level.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">The ability to lift from a
        level.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><a name="C42"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>2</b></font></a><font
face="Times New Roman"><b>. The thrust.<br>
</b>The other element of flight, the propulsive ability or the
thrust, can only to a small degree develop independently of
elevating, as propelling in space only can be exercised during
the fall.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This means that the evolution of
the propelling ability can be comprehended as an continously
increased ability deliberately to derivate from the track of a
fall.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>According to this concept, the
flight might have evolved in birds as a remedy to reduce the
velocity of a free fall from a level, and as a remedy
deliberately to derivate from the track of the fall.</i></font></p>

<p><a name="C50"><font face="Arial"><b><i>5</i></b></font></a><font
face="Arial"><b><i>. The selective motive.</i></b></font></p>

<p><a name="C51"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>1</b></font></a><font
face="Times New Roman"><b>. Elevation.<br>
</b>The selective pressure on the pre-birds to evolve the ability
of flight in the sence of elevation, most likely was the
reduction of the damaging impact of a jump or a fall from a
level, supposely from the side of a tree-trunk.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This impact might quantitatively
be estimated as the amount of kinetic energy of the body of the
pre-bird at the end of the fall according to the equation</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">E<sub>kin</sub> =
1/2 M x V<sup>2</sup> </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">where M is the mass of the
pre-bird and V is the terminal velocity af the fall.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Templin (1976) has roughly
estimated that the terminal velocity of a falling animal should
not esceed 6 m/sec to prevent injury of its body, which velocity
equals the terminal velocity from a free fall from a hight of 1.8
meters.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This might have been lesser the
hight of a cycadoid, and it seems reasonably that a jump from a
hight of 2 - 3 meters is the ultimate hight from which the
pre-bird with no ability to elevate might have jumped down
without injury, if it was able to buffer the impact of the jump
by its hindlegs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">If, on the other hand, the
down-jump from such a altitude was in any way miscarried, injury
should be inevitable.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Under such circumstances the
price of survival should be high, if the pre-bird, climbing down
from the top of 3 meters tall cycad evolved some means to reduce
the velocity of a fall.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The evolution of such a means to
reduce the impact of the fall, consequently equals the evolution
of some degree of flight in the sence of elevating.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Due to the mentioned general
principles of evolution, the question to be asked therefore is
whether the behaviour, which the pre-birds have evolved by
climbing in the described manner, implied some power of reducing
the terminal velocity of the fall.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Beneath it is demonstrated
that a forelimb flapping performed during the jump-descent in
fact has such an effect! </i></font></p>

<p><a name="C52"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>2</b></font></a><font
face="Times New Roman"><b>. The thrust.<br>
</b>The selective motive of the pre-birds originally to evolve
the ability of propulsing was most likely to elongate the track
of the onset from the side of the tree-trunk when dismounting.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">During the onset the pre-bird
should perform a vertical rotation of its body in order to hit
the ground by its downstretched hindlegs. A horizontal elongation
of the track thus increased the possibility to complete the
rotation and thereby to secure a safe alighting. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Later on, when some ability to
reduce the velocity of the fall had evolved, the motive of
evolving the ability of propelling most likely was to alight at a
lesser angle to the ground and to land on a chosen spot.</font></p>

face="Arial"><b><i>. The elevating effect of flapping forelimbs.<br>
</i></b></font><font face="Times New Roman">To demonstrate the
elevating effect of the forelimb flapping an experiment of
thought shall be caried out:</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">A bird suspended in its
outstretched forelimbs between two supports is imagined to
perform a simultaneous retraction of the pectoralis major muscles
to depress the humeri. The forelimbs then function as a couple of
one-armed levers, the distal fulcrum of which is the distal end
of the forelimb and the proximal fulcrum is the shoulder joint.
See fig. 14.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The distal ends of the forelimbs
are then met by the upward force of the supporters, and if these
are firm, they retard the downstroke completely. The retraction
of the pectoralismuscles therefore press the proximal ends of the
humeri upwards against the scapular edge of the glenoid, the
result of which is an elevation of the body relatively to the
forelimbs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This elevating effect is
homologuous with the elevation of the forepart of the body which
the quadrupedal bird-ancestors used to perform by their forelimbs
in locomotion. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">When a pre-bird performed a
jump-descent, the velocity of the fall solely depends on the
duration and the length of the fall according to the equations</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">V = G x T, and S =
1/2G x T<sup>2</sup>,</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">where V is the velocity of the
fall, T the duration of the fall, S the distance of the fall and
G is the factor of acceleration caused by the gravity,
approximately 9.8</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">By means of these equations the
duration, distance and velocity of a pre-bird, which jumped down
from a level of 3 meters, neglible of air resistance is
estimated.</font></p>

<p><a name="C61"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>1</b></font></a><font
face="Times New Roman"><b>. The mechanical effect. <br>
The forlimb flapping has some mechanical effect of elevating.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">If a pre-bird performs a
down-jump with imovable, outstretched forelimbs, the forelimbs,
of course, fall down with the same velocity as the rest of the
pre-bird's body. But if the pre-bird during the fall performs a
downstroke by its forelimbs, the downward velocity of the
forelimbs is increased during the stroke by the velocity of the
stroke. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">That is to say that the mass of
the forelimbs is accelerated downwards relatively to the trunk.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Newton's second law,
force is equal to mass times acceleration, and according to
Newton's third law on action and reaction, an upward force
therefore is created on the forelimbs. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In principle this force is equal
to the the upward force of the supports in the experiment
mentioned above, and according to this experiment, the downstroke

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Consequently the downstroke
increases the impact of the fall. </i></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The quantity of the upward force
and the elevating effect depends on the mass of the forelimbs and
of the velocity of the downstroke. Further this depends on the
duration of the stroke and the length of the outstretched
forelimbs and of the angle of the stroke.</font><a

<p><font face="Times New Roman">However little this solely
mechanical effect of a downstroke might be, its mere existence
might have bridged the evolutionary slope between the stage of <i>no
elevating ability</i> and the stage of <i>some elevating ability</i>.
And it might have been the evolutionary motive of the pre-birds
to maintain the performance of the climbing forelimb movements
during the down-jumps.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">A further evolutionary
improvement of the mechanical effect of the downstrokes might
have been the elongation of the forelimbs, especially of the
hands, as this increased the accelerated mass of the forelimbs
and thereby the momentum of the elevation.<br>
Such an elongation of the hands should also have been usefull as
a prerequisite of the winged flight.</font></p>

face="Times New Roman"><b>. The aerodynamic effect.<br>
Another aerodynamic principle than that of Bernoulli's governed
the evolution of flapping flight in birds.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Most authors, who have dealt with
the lifting effect of birds' flight, e.g. Brown (1951),
Pennycuick (1972, 1975) and most textbooks, seem almost to have
considered this effect to be based on Bernoulli's theorem. Only
Headly (1912) deals with another aerodynamic elevating effect of
wingstrokes</font><a href="oricom.htm#5) Actually Heilman"><font
face="Times New Roman">.</font><font color="#FF0000"><sup>5</sup></font></a>)</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">According to Bernoulli's theorem,
an airstream which passes over a tilted plate creates a negative
dynamic air pressure which causes a lift of the plate.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">However relevant this aerodynamic
principle might be in modern flying birds, it is of no relevans
what so ever considering the origin of flight in pre-birds which
had not yet evolved feathered wings as airfoils.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The elevating effect of an
airstream according to Bernoulli's theorem depends on the
presence of airfoils of considerable size held in an acute angle
of attac against an airstream of considerable magnitude, the
latter produced by a forward thrust.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The down-jumping pre-birds did
not possess such airfoils, and the thrust, which they were able
to exersice was the horizontal onset from the tree-trunk. This
onset was moreover opposed by the air resistance - the drag - the
greater the force of the onset and the area of the airfoil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The lifting effect, consequently,
should be neutralized by further evolution of airfoils and more
powerful onset!</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The evolutionary motive of
evolving feathered wings for elevating purpose by Bernoulli's
principle, therefore seems to vanish by the same evolution. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Therefore, it is obvious that
another aerodynamic - aeromechanical - principle governed the
primordeal evolution of the capacity of flight. </i></font></p>

<p><a name="C63"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>3</b></font></a><font
face="Times New Roman"><b>. The aerodynamic principle of
elevation in flapping.<br>
</b>When a plate is moved in a right angle to its extention
through an airfilled space, it removes an amount of air from its
frontside into the adjacent space. And a similar amount of air
should be removed from the adjacent space to the back of the
plate. The distance of the removal depends on the extention of
the plate.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The amount, i.e. the mass of air
to be removed per time unit is direct proportional to the area of
the plate and to the velocity of its movement through the space.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The removal of air demands
kinetic energy according to the equation</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">E<sub>kin</sub> =
1/2 M x V<sup>2</sup></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">where M is the mass of air to be
removed and V is the velocity of the removal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">As this energy must be delivered
by the moved plate, the kinetic energy of which is reduced
equally, it is obvious that the moved plate is met by a force
which increases proportionally to the area of the plate and
square to its velocity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>This opposing force is
generally known as air resistance or drag.</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">When a pre-bird in jump-descent
accomplished a downstroke by its outstretched forelimbs, these
had the character of plates, however small, which moved through
an airfilled space, and they were met by an upward force of the
air resistance which, according to the said principle was
increased by square the velocity of its movement through the
space.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>That is to say that the
forelimbs in downstroke have some elevating effect in the said
meaning, i.e. some ability to decrease the velocity of the fall
and thus to reduce the impact of the jump. </i></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">As to be seen from the equation
the effect increases by <i>square</i> the velocity of the
downstrokes. That motivates evolutionarily pre-birds with a
previous habit of performing the strokes to maintain and further
to develop this habit.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This effect is also increased by <i>any
enlargement</i> of the area of the forelimbs, which emerged as
the feathers evolved. Even a rim of small feathers should have
increased the elevating effect and have motivated a further
evolution of the feathered wings.</font></p>

face="Arial"><b><i>. The propulsive effect. The thrust.<br>
</i></b></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>The aerodynamic
principle of propulsion in flapping.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">When a plate is moved in an
obtruse angle through an airfilled space, a positive dynamic air
pressure is created and reacts upon the plate at a right angle to
the direction of its movement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This aerodynamic effect is
well-known from air screws and its magnitude depends on the angle
of the plate, its extension and its velocity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The downstroke with the
unfeathered forelimbs during the jump-descent had hardly any
propulsive effect on the pre-bird, and the only way to derivate
from the track of the fallway was the onset from the tree.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">When the feathers had emerged on
the rear border of the forelimbs, motivated by the elevating
effect, some aeromechanical propulsive effect might, however,
originate:</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">If a pre-bird with small feathers
on its forelimbs accomplished a downstroke during the fall, the
air pressure should have bend the feathers obliquely upwards so
that a forward air pressure was created, throwing the animal
forward.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>That is to say that some
propulsion was created.</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In the recovery stroke - the
upstroke - the feathers were bend obliquely downwards and a
similar forward air pressure was created. This air pressure
created also some effect of propulsion or thrust.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This effect might evolutionarily
have bridged the slope between pre-birds with no propulsive
ability and those with <i>some</i> propulsive ability.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This effect motivated a further
evolution of the flapping flight, which in modern birds gives a
considerable effect of trust.</font></p>
