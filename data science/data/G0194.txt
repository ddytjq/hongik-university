<H2>ANNUAL REPORT </H2>
</center>
The following report is organised scientifically according to the six subject
areas set out in the original proposal. In addition to the subject workshops
mentioned in the individual sections, an annual meeting of the entire network was
held over the period 19 to 24 May, 1997 at Ringberg Castle, Bavaria. 63~scientific
participants in the network attended this meeting. Further details of this and other
activities can be found on the network webpage.

<B> 1 Radio Galaxy Evolution </B><br>
 The `Westerbork Northern
Sky Survey' (WENSS) has now been completed, and has enabled the selection and study
of samples of low luminosity radio galaxies. In addition, in conjunction with other
radio surveys, it has been used as the basis for a successful search for the most
distant radio galaxies. Optical and infrared imaging using the HST has been carried
out on distant radio galaxies with giant ionised gas halos, showing these to consist
of many distinct clumps, possibly subunits coming together to form a massive central
galaxy. <br>
<UL>
<LI> Highlights:
<br><br>
Demonstrating, using powerful radio galaxies from a Cambridge
survey, that distant radio galaxies lie at the centre of the most massive
structures in the early Universe. 
<br><br>
A detection of powerful extended X-ray emission from a very distant
radio galaxy, indicating an extremely large mass of material.
<br><br>
The use of WENSS to show that the comoving number density of radio
galaxies falls beyond a redshift of two, thus defining the extent of the
`quasar epoch'.
<br><br>
The discovery of the most distant radio galaxy known in the southern
hemisphere.
<br><br>
<LI> Networking and coordination activities:
<br><br>
A network meeting on ``The K$-z$ relationship, observations and theory'' was held
in Leiden on 31st January 1997, involving participants from 5 network sites.
The report is available on the network WWW site. A number of Leiden
scientists have travelled to network meetings at other nodes of the network. In
addition, Christian Kaiser (Cambridge) visited Leiden from one week in July 1997 for
collaborative work with Philip Best and Huub R&oumlttgering, and with
Guinevere Kauffmann (Munich) who was working in Leiden for two weeks at the time.
<br><br>
<LI> Appointment of young researchers:
<br><br>
Two young researchers are employed by the network on this topic. One is
Philip Best. He has travelled to meetings
at other sites of the network, and is now involved in active
collaborations with researchers in Leiden, Cambridge, Paris and Munich. The second
is Malcolm Bremer in Paris who maintains active collaborations with Cambridge and
Leiden.

<B> 2 Evolution of Field and Cluster Galaxies </B>
<br><br>
A key objective in the network programme is the understanding of how
galaxies evolve in rich cluster environments. Detailed comparisons of a
very large imaging and spectroscopic dataset (from ground-based
telescopes and HST) have allowed us link the morphological and stellar
population properties of cluster galaxies at large look-back-times with
those in similar environments at low redshift. A strong morphological
evolution has been found for the S0 and spiral populations, as well as
for the morphology-density relation in irregular clusters.  Moreover,
the brightest cluster galaxies have increased their mass in stars by
factors $\simeq2$--$4$ in the last $\simeq8\,$billion years.  Detailed
semi-analytic galaxy formation models linked with spectro-photometric
galaxy evolution models have provided a good understanding of the
origin of these evolutionary phenomena within the context of the
hierarchical scenario of structure formation in the Universe.
<br><br>
To understand the strong evolution found in the field galaxy
populations at high redshift a key issue is how galaxy interactions
(collisions, mergers, etc) affect the gaseous interstellar medium (the
raw material from which stars will form) and the consequent formation
of stars.   We have found that gas is expelled during the process of
star formation. Moreover, in a close interaction between a small and a
large galaxy, the cannibalism of the interstellar medium of the smaller
system by the larger  may be almost 100\% efficient in a single
crossing of the galaxies ---this is something not previously considered
possible.
<br><br>
The commissioning of the new SCUBA bolometer array receiver at the
James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) has improved the performance of
submillimetre-wave continuum observations by between one and three
orders of magnitude. This has made observations of dust ---a key
ingredient of star-formation--- in extremely distant galaxies
practical for the first time.  Exciting recent observations in the
fields of rich clusters have provided our first look at the population
of distant ($z>1$) star-forming galaxies in the submillimetre
waveband.
<br><br>
The detailed study of the field galaxy population in the crucial
$1<z<2.5$ redshift range, where the star-formation density of the
universe is expected to peak, has been severely hampered  so far by the
lack of sensitive and versatile near-infrared spectrographs because the
most useful spectral diagnostics of the star-formation history of the
galaxies appear in the near-infrared windows. A unique instrument, the
Cambridge OH-suppression spectrograph is now nearly completed and will
be commissioned in January 1998. It will allow us, for the first time,
to obtain near-infrared spectra of large samples of very faint galaxies
at the epoch of maximum star formation activity.
<br><br>
<UL>
<LI> Highlights: 
<br><br>
A remarkable new result is the discovery with the Ryle
Telescope of a cluster candidate via the Sunyaev--Zel'dovich
decrement in the cosmic microwave background radiation towards the
quasar pair PC1643+4631A\&B at redshift $z=3.8$.  Very deep optical,
infrared and X-ray images have revealed no cluster at $z<2$ that is
similar to known galaxy clusters, implying that the system must be a
massive cluster either at $z>2$, or at $z<2$ and dark.  Either way,
this system is a challenge for models for the formation of galaxies and
larger structures.
<br><br>
<LI> Networking and coordination activities:
<br><br>
Cambridge hosted a working group meeting on the subject "Evolution of
Field and Cluster Galaxies" (February 28 - March 1, 1997).  The primary
aim of the meeting was to discuss and set up collaborative projects,
and to produce work plans and ideas for exchange of personnel within
the network. The following scientific topics were discussed: evolution
of galaxies in clusters, redshift surveys of field galaxies, star
formation rate history of the Universe, HII and starburst galaxies at
different redshifts,  chemical evolution and IGM enrichment, relation
starbursts-AGNs,  star formation and stellar populations in nearby
galaxies and high redshift galaxies. The meeting was attended by 16
researchers from other network institutions, and 24 Cambridge-based
researchers.
<br>
An Internet WWW home page with scientific and practical information on 
Network activities has been established. It contains links to the rest
of the network institutions. The URL is:

<br><br>
<LI> Appointment of young researchers:
<br><br>
In October 1st, 1996, Dr. Bianca M. Poggianti
was appointed as a research fellow in Cambridge, funded by the Network. The
appointment has a duration of two years. She had been awarded a PhD from the
University of Padova, and had a post-doctoral research appointment at the Kapteyn
Instituut in Groningen before moving to Cambridge. Her main research activities
are related to the evolution of the stellar populations and spectral
properties of galaxies. She actively collaborates with researchers in
Cambridge, Padova and Durham within the Network. At the same time Dr.\ Itziar
Aretxaga was appointed for two years in Garching. She works on starbursts in
galactic nuclei and collaborates actively with Cambridge researchers.

<B> 3 QSO absorption lines</B>
<br><br>
The study of the gas in and around galaxies as seen in quasar
absorption lines has progressed in the direction of understanding the
extent, structure, metallicity and ionization state of galaxy halos at
high redshift. A collaboration between IAP and
IoA has detected for the first time CO emission at very
high redshift (4.4 and 4.7), in correspondence of strong
associated absorption systems and revealed the presence of dust.
A collaboration including IAP and Padova has successfully obtained
a spectrum of one of the galaxies showing these remarkable properties,
observing a strong Lyman-$\alpha$ emission at $z=4.702$ and inferring
a star formation rate of about 20 solar masses per year.
Suitable groups of quasars for testing with multiple lines of sight (LOS)
the characteristic sizes and clustering properties of the high-z absorbers
have been searched for in a collaboration between Padova and IAP.
A very interesting group of 4 relatively bright
QSOs ($V \leq 19.5$), all at $z>2$ and
within a square field of 10 arcmin side, has been located in the SGP and
will allow to probe multiple LOS separations between 0.6 and 3.4 Mpc
with observations planned for fall 1998.
A collaboration for comparing this type of observations with hydro-dynamical
simulation is starting between Garching and Padova.
A search for high-z ($z>3$) relatively bright ($18.5<R<20$) quasars
in the candidate areas for the Hubble Deep Field South is in progress.
This provides a unique opportunity for European astronomy since
subsequent VLT observations will combine two fundamental pieces of 
information: high resolution spectroscopy of the quasar and low-resolution 
deep spectroscopy of the field galaxies.  The first will provide insight into
the properties of the gaseous components along the line of sight (at $z>1.8$ 
and $z>1.2$ for the detection of Ly-alpha and CIV absorbers, respectively).  
The second the distribution with redshift of the faint galaxies close to 
the quasar sight-line and in the surrounding field. The Network has proposed
successfully to begin follow--up of HDF--South on ESO's telescopes. <p>
<B> 4 Stellar population modelling </B>
<br><br>
The primary objectives in this area are to match the full observed 
ranges of wavelengths, metallicities, and elemental abundance ratios
in population synthesis models and to identify reliable indicators
of star formation. At this time, Padova and Cambridge team members
have calibrated with unprecedented accuracy the effects of varying 
metallicities and elemental abundance ratios on stellar evolution and on
the spectral signatures of early-type galaxies (Tantalo et al. 1997;
Poggianti \& Barbaro 1997; Rampazzo et al. 1997; Garcia-Vargas et al.
1997). Accurate calibrations of stellar infrared colors by the Padova
and Paris team members and the inclusion of circumstellar dust emission
in the Padova synthesis models also opens new possibilities to disentangle
age and metallicity effects in observed stellar populations (Ng et al. 1997;
Bressan et al. 1997). In addition, Cambridge and Padova team members have
developed nebular emission models that will now be used to calibrate the 
star formation rates of distant galaxies (Poggianti \& Barbaro 1997;
Barbaro \& Poggianti 1997). In Paris, population synthesis programs 
were completed for the full observed range of metallicities (Bruzual
\& Charlot 1997) and implemented in the Munich semi-analytic models.
Highly encouraging first results show that hierarchical galaxy formation
is compatible with all observed properties of early-type galaxies (Kauffmann
et al. 1996; Kauffmann \& Charlot 1997). Paris team members also developed
new models for the infrared emission of galaxies to interpret current and
future IR/submm observations (Guiderdoni et al. 1997a, b). This prescription,
is being implemented into the Durham semi-analytic models and combined with
the Padova scheme of AGN/QSO formation to make detailed comparisons with
observations (Baugh et al. 1997; Franceschini et al. 1997). In particular,
the models will be tested against a successful Paris-Padova survey achieved
with the Infrared Space Observatory (Puget et al. 1997).

A workshop on this topic took place in Paris on Feb. 7/8 1997 and was
attended by 11 researchers from the other 5~sites.

Dr. Y. Ng has been employed for two years in Padova as a network postdoc in this
field. He has active collaborations with Paris and Leiden.

<B> 5 Semi-Analytic Models of Galaxy Formation </B>
<br><br>
There has been considerable progress this year in using semi-analytic
techniques to understand the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies in a
scenario where they are formed from mergers of disks.
G.Kauffmann a (MPA) and S.Charlot (IAP) included a prescription for chemical
evolution into their modelling and demonstrated that it is possible to 
obtain a good fit to the slope and scatter colour-magnitude relation of cluster
ellipticals, both at present and at high redshift. G.Kauffmann (MPA), S. Charlot (IAP) 
and S. White (MPA) analyzed the reddest galaxies from a large, deep redshift survey
and showed that only one third of present-day ellipticals existed in their 
present form at redshift 1, lending important new support to the merger picture. 
A. Aragon-Salmanca (IoA), C.Baugh (Durham) and G. Kauffmann (MPA) have studied the evolution
of brightest cluster galaxies from a redshift of one to the present day. They also find
that the semi-analytic merger model provides a good fit to the data. 
<br><br>
An ongoing collaboration between G. Kauffmann (MPA) and S. Charlot (IAP) aims to
explain the observed properties of globular cluster systems of elliptical galaxies.
P. Best (Leiden), H. Rottgering (Leiden) and G. Kauffmann (MPA) are also modelling
the evolution of environments and luminosity functions of radio galaxies and other
AGN using semi-analytic techniques.
<br><br>
S. Cole, C. Baugh \&  C. Frenk (Durham) in collaboration with C. Lacey 
(Copenhagen) have rewritten their code for studying semi-analytic 
galaxy formation. More comprehensive stellar population models and chemical 
enrichment has been incorporated into the model. A treatment of galaxy sizes is also made. 
The new code has been applied to study the properties of 
the recently discovered population of Lyman break galaxies at $z=3$, 
leading to the interpretation that these objects mark the first 
significant episode of galaxy formation in the universe.  
The amplitude predicted for the clustering of these objects has been 
tested in a project with Governato (Durham) and Quinn \& Stadel (Seattle), 
in which the semi-analytic model was used to identify halos in 
an N-body simulation that should contain Lyman break galaxies.
<br><br>
Collaborations have been started with the Padova group 
(Bressan, Granato, Silva) and the Paris group (Guiderdoni, Devrient, Buchet) 
to study the effects of dust on galaxy SEDs, with an aim to make predicitons 
for ISO/SCUBA counts.
<br><br>
<UL>
<LI> Highlights: 
<br><br>
The demonstration that most observed ellipticals attained their observed form after
redshift one, but that such a history is nevertheless consistent with the
systematic properties of the elliptical population.
<br><br> 
<LI>Networking and coordination activities: 
<br><br>
A workshop on semianalytic was held in Garching on 20/21 March 1997 and was
attended by about 25~scientists from all 6~sites.

<B> 6 Simulations of galaxies and clusters </B> 
<br><br>
Progress in this area has been substantial. The year 1 milestone
(characterising the expected ``core" structure of dark halos in different
cosmologies) was reached on schedule (see ``highlights" below) and
significant progress was achieved against our remaining objectives.
Activity took place at Durham, Munich and Padova, resulting in 24 joint
publications involving researchers in the first two of these. Network
researchers (Colberg, Frenk, Jenkins, Kay, Pearce, Springel and White, in
collaboration with external scientists in some cases) carried out
simulations of the clustering evolution of dark matter in different
cosmogonies. These were performed on supercomputers in the UK and Germany
and are amongst the largest ever attempted. In collaboration with network
partners at Durham and Munich, one of the young researchers funded by the
network (Dr. Governato) began an extensive programme of
N-body/gasdynamical simulations of the formation of galactic disks,
working towards the year 2 milestone. Another young researcher at Padova
(Dr. Carraro) performed similar simulations, in this case applied to the
formation of elliptical galaxies. Finally, researchers at Munich and
Durham completed the first phase of development of a new fully parallel
N-body/gasdynamical simulation code specifically designed to work on the
massively parallel supercomputers to which network researchers have
substantial access. An interim (N-body only) version of this code is now
operational and will soon be used to perform the largest ever cosmological
simulation of the evolution of dark matter over virtually the entire
visible universe.
<br><br>
<UL>
<LI> Highlights: 
<br><br>
1) The discovery that the radial density profiles of dark matter halos
formed in hierarchical clustering cosmologies have a universal form,
independent of mass and cosmological parameters. This form accurately
describes the density profile over approximately two orders of magnitude
in radius. The characteristic density (or radial scale) of a halo is well 
correlated with its total mass, reflecting the later formation epochs 
of halos of increasing mass. 
<br><br>
2) The largest ever supercomputer simulations of the formation of cosmic
structures. These were used to derive high precision determinations of the
clustering statistics of cold dark matter as a function of time in large
cosmological volumes, and of the abundance and internal properties of
galaxy and galaxy cluster halos.
<br><br>
<LI> Networking and coordination activities: 
<br><br>
Durham organized a 2-day meeting to coordinate research in cosmological
simulations across the network. The meeting, held on 2-3/May/1997, was
attended by 17 participants from 5 network institutions. Several
collaborative projects were advanced or initiated at this meeting and some
have already led to publications (see below). A programme and minutes of
the meeting were posted on the network webpage.
<br><br>
<LI> Appointment of young researchers: 
<br><br>
Dr. Fabio Governato was appointed to a postdoctoral position at Durham
funded by the network. His main responsibility is to carry out
N-body/gasdynamical simulations of the formation of galaxy disks in a
cosmological context, including prescriptions to model star formation and
feedback. The post was advertised alongside those at the other network
institutions. In order to integrate Dr. Governato into the network
programme, he undertook visits to Padova, Paris and Munich.
