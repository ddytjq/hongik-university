<h2>Introduction to Phylogenetics</h2>

<p> <img alt="D" align="left" src="/pictures/letters/D.gif" width="42"
height="45" />escent from a common ancestor entails a process of branching and
divergence of species, in common with any genealogical process. Genealogies can
be graphically illustrated by tree-like diagrams, and this is why you will hear
evolutionists refer to the genealogy of species as the "tree of life." Diagrams
such as these are known as phylogenetic trees or phylogenies. Figure 1 shows an
example I will use here. <i>The macroevolutionary prediction of one true
historical phylogenetic tree is the most important, powerful, and basic
conclusion from the hypothesis of universal common descent.</i> A thorough
grasp of this concept is necessary for understanding macroevolutionary
deductions. In the following section, I give a brief overview of phylogenetic
trees and how biologists determine them. </p>

<h3>Phylogenetic Reconstructions: Reliability</h3>

<p><small> In order to establish their validity in reliably determining
phylogenies, cladistic methods have been empirically tested in cases where the
true phylogeny is known with certainty, since the true phylogeny was directly
observed. </small></p>

<ol>

<li><small> Bacteriophage T7 was propagated and split sequentially in the
presence of a mutagen, where each lineage was tracked. Out of 135,135 possible
phylogenetic trees, the true tree was correctly determined by cladistic methods
in a blind analysis. Five different statistical cladistic methods were used
independently, and each one chose the correct tree (<a
href="#Hillis1992">Hillis et al.1992 </a>). </small></li>

<li><small> In another study, 24 strains of mice were used in which the
genealogical relationships were known. Cladistic analysis reproduced almost
perfectly the known phylogeny of the 24 strains (<a
href="#AtchelyFitch1991">Atchely and Fitch 1991</a>). </small></li>

<li><small> Bush et. al. used phylogenetic analysis to retrospectively predict
the correct evolutionary tree of human Influenza A virus 83% of the time for
the flu seasons spanning 1983 to 1994. </small></li>

<li><small> In 1998, researchers used 111 modern HIV-1 (AIDS virus) sequences
in a phylogenetic analysis to predict the nucleotide sequence of the viral
ancestor of which they were all descendants. The predicted ancestor sequence
closely matched, with high statistical probability, the actual HIV sequence
found in an HIV-1 seropositive African plasma sample collected and archived in
the Belgian Congo in 1959 (<a href="#Zhu1998">Zhu et al.1998 </a>).
</small></li>

<li><small> In the past decade, phylogenetic analyses have played a significant
role in successful convictions in several criminal court cases (<a
href="#Albert_etal1994">Albert et al. 1994</a>; <a
href="#Arnold_etal1995">Arnold et al. 1995</a>; <a href="#Birch_etal2000">Birch

href="#Vogel1997">Vogel 1997</a>; <a href="#Yirrell_etal1997">Yirrell et al.

legal testimony in the United States (97-KK- 2220 <i>State of Louisiana v.
Richard J. Schmidt</i> [<a
href="http://www.denverda.org/legalResource/schmidt1997.PDF">PDF</a>]) . The
legal test in the U. S. for admissibility of expert testimony is the
<i>Daubert</i> guidelines (U. S. Supreme Court Case <a
href="http://supct.law.cornell.edu:8080/supct/html/92-102.ZS.html"><i>Daubert
v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</i></a>, 509 U.S. 579, 587-89, 113 S. Ct.
2786, 2794, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469, 1993). The Daubert guidelines state that a trial
court should consider five factors in determining "whether the testimony's
underlying reasoning or methodology is scientifically valid": (1) whether the
theory or technique in question can be and has been tested; (2) whether it
has been subjected to peer review and publication; (3) its known or potential
error rate; (4) the existence and maintenance of standards controlling its
operation; and (5) whether it has attracted widespread acceptance within the
relevant scientific community (quoted nearly verbatim). Phylogenetic analysis
has officially met these legal requirements. </small></li>

<p> Phylogenetic trees are normally portrayed with two dimensions: a time
dimension and a morphological dimension. In most examples, such as this one,
the time dimension is plotted on the vertical axis, and the morphological
dimension is plotted on the horizontal axis. It is important to be aware that
morphology is extremely multidimensional in reality, but it is usually
displayed as one-dimensional for graphical simplicity and clarity. When
phylogenies are constructed from molecular sequence data, sequence similarity
replaces morphology on the horizontal axis. Note that in most phylogenies, as
with this illustration, both time and morphology are relative, not absolute.
Exceptions include phylogenies that are correlated with fossil data and
phylogenies that incorporate a "molecular clock." </p>

<p> A common misconception is that some modern species are ancestral to another
modern species. However, all modern species are found at the tips of the tree's
branches, and one modern species is as "evolved" as any other. That is,
although mammals are thought to have evolved from something that resembled
modern reptiles, modern reptiles are just as "old" evolutionarily as modern
mammals (<a href="#Brooks1991">Brooks 1991</a>, p.68; <a
href="#Futuyma1998">Futuyma 1998</a>, p.113). </p>

<p> If modern species have descended from ancestral ones in this tree-like,
branching manner, a rigorous classification of species should reflect their
divergence and it should be possible to infer the true historical tree that
traces their paths of descent. The consensus model which evolutionary
biologists use to represent the well-supported branches of the true tree I will
refer to as the "standard phylogenetic tree" (see <a href="#fig1">Figure
1</a>). In 1950, taxonomist <a
href="http://www.cladistics.org/about/hennig.html">Willi Hennig</a> proposed a
method for determining the standard phylogenetic tree based on morphology by
classifying organisms according to their shared derived characters (<a
href="#Hennig1966">Hennig 1966</a>). This method, now called cladistics, does
not assume genealogical relatedness <i>a priori</i>, since it can be used to
classify anything in principle, even things like books, cars, or chairs that
are obviously not genealogically related (although I'm not sure why one would
want to). Neither does it use circular logic; the conclusions and predictions
from a cladistic analysis are not part of the input data. Using firm
evolutionary arguments, Hennig reasoned that his method was the most
appropriate classification technique for determining evolutionary relationships
generated by lineal descent. In fact, Hennig's cladistics is really just a
rigorous formalization of the classification methods biologists had been using
intuitively ever since Linnaeus. Evolutionists today construct their
phylogenetic trees based on Hennig's method, and because of cladistics these
phylogenetic trees are reproducible and independently testable. (<a
href="#Brooks1991">Brooks 1991</a>, Ch. 2). </p>

<p> It is important to keep in mind that Hennig's phylogenies are determined
<i>using only shared <a href="glossary.html#derived"
target="_blank">derived</a> characters of organisms, not <a
href="glossary.html#primitive" target="_blank">primitive</a>, paralogous, or
analogous characters</i> (<a href="#Brooks1991">Brooks 1991</a>, pp. 35-36).
"Primitive" and "derived" are relative terms. As a generality, primitive
characters are characters shared by the most organisms; derived characters are
shared by fewer organisms. For example, backbones are primitive characters of
vertebrates; hair is a derived character particular to mammalian vertebrates.
However, when considering mammals only, hair is primitive, whereas an opposable
thumb is derived. <a href="glossary.html#paralogy"
target="_blank">Paralogous</a> characters have the same structure but different
functions; <a href="glossary.html#analogy" target="_blank">analogous</a>
characters have different structures but the same function. For example, bird
wings and ape arms are paralogous; bird wings and insect wings are analogous.
</p>

<p> In contrast, <i>shared derived characters must have the same function and
structure</i> (<a href="#Brooks1991">Brooks 1991</a>, Chs. 3 and 5).
Consequently, paralogous and analogous characters cannot be used to determine a
cladistic phylogeny; in fact, the phylogeny ultimately determines which
characters are analogous and/or paralogous (<a href="#Brooks1991">Brooks
1991</a>, pp. 25-26). Hennig's method of maximum statistical parsimony resolves
which characters are the most probable primitive and derived characters for a
group of species. Thus, some parts of a phylogeny can be ambiguous, and some
parts can be well determined. </p>

<h3>Phylogenetic Reconstructions: Caveats</h3>

<p> <small>As with any investigational scientific method, certain conditions
must hold in order for the results to be reliable. The list below gives some of
the more important caveats that scientists must keep in mind when interpreting
the results of a phylogenetic analysis (<a href="#Swofford_etal1996">Swofford
1996</a>, pp. 493-509). In general, the contribution of each of these concerns
will be "averaged out" by including more independent characters in the
cladistic analysis.</small> </p>

<h4><i>Cladistics</i></h4>

<ol>

<li><small> <b>Correlated characters:</b> each character used in the analysis
optimally should be genetically independent. Characters that are strongly
functionally correlated are better thought of as a single character. There are
statistical tests that can control for unrecognized character correlation, such
as the subsampled bootstrap and the jackknife with 50% deletion. </small></li>

<li><small> <b>True structural convergence:</b> structures that have undergone
convergent evolution can artificially result in incorrect tree topologies.
Fortunately, compared to other phylogenetic methods, cladistics is especially
useful for resolving apparent structural convergence. Including more characters
in the analysis also aids in overcoming convergent effects. </small></li>

<li><small> <b>Character reversals:</b> characters that revert to an ancestral
state pose a challenge similar to convergence. </small></li>

<li><small> <b>Lost characters:</b> lineages that have lost characters (such as
whales and their hindlimbs) can also pose cladistic problems. Often, if a
cladistic analysis indicates strongly that a certain character has been lost
during evolution, it is best to omit this character in higher resolution
analyses of that lineage. </small></li>

<li><small> <b>Missing characters:</b> incomplete fossils are problematic,
since they may lack important characters. Better fossils are the answer.
</small></li>

<li><small> <b>Parsimony:</b> requiring that the best tree is the one with the
least amount of change is only justified if each character under analysis has
the same probability of evolving (in the long term). If there is independent
evidence that this assumption is not justified, it is best to weight characters
according to their evolutionary probability. For instance, it is known that
certain base mutations are more likely to happen than others. </small></li>

<li><small><b> Intractable number of possible phylogenetic trees:</b> for
computational reasons, this is one of the most important phylogenetic
challenges to overcome. The goal of a phylogenetic reconstruction is to
determine the best tree that the data supports. For an analysis of only five
species, there are 15 possible trees. For an analysis of 50 species, there are
over 10<sup>74</sup> possible trees that must be searched - which is
computationally impossible. This problem is not as bad as it first sounds,
since narrowing down the number of reasonable trees can be trivial in many
cases (for instance, using the branch and bound algorithm). Several methods
have been developed to work around this issue successfully, and ultimately more
powerful computers are better. </small><br />

<p> Every branch of a phylogeny can be assigned an objective statistical
confidence based on the data (<a href="#MaddisonMaddison1992">Maddison and

href="#Swofford_etal1996">Swofford et al. 1996</a>, pp. 504-509). The preceding
point is significant - any cladogram, including what I call the standard
phylogenetic tree, is a best approximation of the true tree. Some cladistic
analyses are strongly supported by the data, some are weakly supported. When
comparing two independent phylogenies of the same organisms, one must take into
account the statistical significance assigned to each branch of the
phylogenies. As with all scientific analyses, the details of a cladogram may
change as new information and data are incorporated. </p>

<p> According to the theory of common descent, modern living organisms, with
all their incredible differences, are the progeny of one single species in the
distant past. In spite of the extensive variation of form and function among
organisms, several fundamental criteria characterize all life. Some of the
macroscopic properties that characterize all of life are (1) replication, (2)
information flow in continuity of kind, (3) catalysis, and (4) energy
utilization (metabolism). At a very minimum, these four functions are required
to generate a physical historical process that can be described by a
phylogenetic tree. </p>

<p> If every living species descended from an original species that had these
four obligate functions, then all living species today should necessarily have
these functions (a somewhat trivial conclusion). Most importantly, however, all
modern species should have inherited the <i>structures</i> that perform these
functions. Thus, a basic prediction of the genealogical relatedness of all
life, combined with the constraint of gradualism, is that organisms should be
very similar in the particular mechanisms and structures that execute these
basic life processes. </p>

<h3>Confirmation:</h3>

<p> All known living things use polymers to perform these four basic functions.
Organic chemists have synthesized hundreds of different polymers, yet the only
ones used by life, irrespective of species, are polynucleotides, polypeptides,
and polysaccharides. Regardless of the species, the DNA, RNA and proteins used
in known living systems all have the same chirality, even though there are at
least two chemically equivalent choices of chirality for each of these
molecules. For example, RNA has four chiral centers in its ribose ring, which
means that it has 16 possible stereoisomers - but only one of these
stereoisomers is found in the RNA of known living organisms. </p>

<p> Ten years after the publication of <i>The Origin of Species</i>, nucleic
acids were first isolated by Friedrich Miescher in 1869. It took another 75
years after this discovery before DNA was identified as the genetic material of
life (<a href="#Avery_etal1944">Avery et al. 1944</a>). It is quite conceivable
that we could have found a different genetic material for each species. In
fact, it is still possible that newly identified species might have unknown
genetic materials. However, all known life uses the same polymer,
polynucleotide (DNA or RNA), for storing species specific information. All
known organisms base replication on the duplication of this molecule. The DNA
used by living organisms is synthesized using only four nucleosides
(deoxyadenosine, deoxythymidine, deoxycytidine, and deoxyguanosine) out of the
dozens known (at least <a
href="http://medlib.med.utah.edu/cgi-bin/rnafind.cgi?NAM=1">99 occur
naturally</a> and many more have been artificially synthesized) (<a
href="http://medlib.med.utah.edu/RNAmods/" target="_blank">Rozenski et al.
1999</a>; <a href="#VoetVoet1995">Voet and Voet 1995</a>, p. 969). </p>

<p> In order to perform the functions necessary for life, organisms must
catalyze chemical reactions. In all known organisms, enzymatic catalysis is
based on the abilities provided by protein molecules (and in relatively rare,
yet important, cases by RNA molecules). There are 293 naturally occurring amino
acids known (<a href="#VoetVoet1995">Voet and Voet 1995</a>, p. 69; <a
href="http://www.ncifcrf.gov/RESID/" target="_blank">Garavelli et al.
2001</a>); however, the protein molecules used by all known living organisms
are constructed with the same subset of 22 amino acids. </p>

<p> There must be a mechanism for transmitting information from the genetic
material to the catalytic material; all known organisms, with extremely rare
exceptions, use the same genetic code for this. The few known exceptions are,
nevertheless, simple and minor variations from the "universal" genetic code
(see Figure 1.1.1) (<a href="#Lehman2001">Lehman 2001</a>; <a
href="#VoetVoet1995">Voet and Voet 1995</a>, p. 967). </p>

<p> All known organisms use extremely similar, if not the same, metabolic
pathways and metabolic enzymes in processing energy-containing molecules. For
example, the fundamental metabolic systems in living organisms are glycolysis,
the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. In all eukaryotes and in
the majority of prokaryotes, glycolysis is performed in the same ten steps, in
the same order, using the same ten enzymes (<a href="#VoetVoet1995">Voet and
Voet 1995</a>, p. 445). In addition, the most basic unit of energy storage, the
adenosine triphosphate molecule (ATP), is the same in all species that have
been studied. </p>

<p> Thousands of new species are discovered yearly, and new DNA and protein
sequences are determined daily from previously unexamined species (<a
href="#Wilson1992">Wilson 1992</a>, Ch. 8); each and every one is a test of the
theory of common descent. Based solely on the theory of common descent and the
genetics of known organisms, we strongly predict that we will never find any
modern species from known phyla on this Earth with a foreign, non-nucleic acid
genetic material. We also make the strong prediction that all newly discovered
species that belong to the known phyla will use the "standard genetic code" or
a close derivative thereof. For example, according to the theory, none of the
thousands of new and previously unknown insects that are constantly being
discovered in the Brazilian rainforest will have non-nucleic acid genomes. Nor
will these yet undiscovered species of insects have genetic codes which are not
close derivatives of the standard genetic code. In the absence of the theory of
common descent, it is quite possible that every species could have a very
different genetic code, specific to it only, since there are 1.4 x
10<sup>70</sup> informationally equivalent genetic codes, all of which use the
same codons and amino acids as the standard genetic code (<a
href="#Yockey1992">Yockey 1992</a>). This possibility could be extremely useful
for organisms, as it would preclude interspecific viral infections; however, it
has not been observed, and the theory of common descent effectively prohibits
such an observation. </p>

<p> As another example - nine new lemur and two marmoset species (all primates)
were discovered in the forests of Madagascar and Brazil in 2000 (<a
href="#Groves2000">Groves 2000</a>; <a
href="#Rasoloarison_etal2000">Rasoloarison et al. 2000</a>; <a
href="#ThalmannGeissmann2000">Thalmann and Geissmann 2000</a>). Ten new monkey
species have been discovered in Brazil alone since 1990 (<a
href="#VanRoosmalen_etal2000">Van Roosmalen et al. 2000</a>). Nothing in
biology prevents these various species from having a hitherto unknown genetic
material or a previously unused genetic code - nothing, that is, except for the
theory of common descent. However, we now know definitively that the new lemurs
use DNA with the standard genetic code (<a href="#Yoder_etal2000">Yoder et al.
2000</a>); the marmosets have yet to be tested. </p>

<p> Furthermore, each species could use a different polymer for catalysis. The
polymers that are used could still be chemically identical yet have different
chiralities in different species. There are thousands of thermodynamically
equivalent glycolysis pathways (even using the same ten reaction steps but in
different orders), so it is possible that every species could have its own
specific glycolysis pathway, tailored to its own unique needs. The same
reasoning applies to other core metabolic pathways, such as the citric acid
cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. </p>

<p> Finally, many molecules besides ATP could serve equally well as the common
currency for energy in various species (CTP, TTP, UTP, ITP, or any ATP-like
molecule with one of the 293 known amino acids or one of the dozens of other
bases replacing the adenosine moiety immediately come to mind). Discovering any
new animals or plants that contained any of the anomalous examples proffered
above would be strong falsifications of common ancestry, but they have not been
found.<br /> </p>

<h2><a id="pred2" name="pred2"></a><a id="nested_hierarchy"
name="nested_hierarchy"></a>Prediction 1.2: A nested hierarchy of species</h2>

<p> As you can see from the phylogeny in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, the
predicted pattern of organisms at any given point in time can be described as
"groups within groups." This nested hierarchical organization of species
contrasts sharply with the continuum of "the great chain of being" and the
continuum predicted by Lamarck's theory of organic progression (<a
href="#Darwin1872">Darwin 1872</a>, <a href="CDhierarchy.html"
target="_blank">pp. 552-553</a>; <a href="#Futuyma1998">Futuyma 1998</a>, pp.
88-92). Mere similarity between organisms is not enough to support
macroevolution; the nested classification pattern that satisfies the
macroevolutionary process is more specific than simple similarity. Few other
natural processes would predict a nested hierarchical classification. Real
world examples that cannot be objectively classified in nested hierarchies are
the elementary particles (which are described by quantum chromodynamics), the
elements (whose organization is described by quantum mechanics and illustrated
by the periodic table), the planets in our Solar System, books in a library, or
specially designed objects like buildings, furniture, cars, etc. </p>

<h3> Phylogenetic Reconstructions: Caveats </h3>

<h4> <i>Molecular methods</i> </h4>

<small> While, theoretically, molecular systematic methods have all the same
caveats as any cladistic method, in practice molecular phylogenetics has
several specific concerns. In fact, some molecular methods (such as UPGMA) are
not truly cladistic, and they are better described as <i>phenetic</i> methods.
</small>

<ol> 

<li><small> <b><i>Maximum Likelihood</i> assumptions:</b> the <i>maximum
likelihood</i> method makes explicit assumptions about the pattern of
nucleotide substitutions based upon a given model of nucleotide evolution.
These assumptions are based upon a solid statistical foundation; however, the
validity of the models must be considered when evaluating the results.
</small></li>

<li><small> <b>Reversals:</b> because DNA and RNA only have four different
character states, they are especially prone to reversals during evolution.
</small></li>

<li><small> <b>Long branch attraction:</b> a theoretical phenomenon in which
lineages that diverged relatively long ago will tend to "cluster" together in a
phylogenetic reconstruction under the appropriate conditions. The mathematical
reasons are somewhat complicated, but using more slowly evolving genes (or
regions of genes) helps overcome the problem. </small></li>

<li><small> <b>Rate variation between lineages:</b> rates of nucleotide
substitution may differ between lineages; this can contribute to long branch
attraction and result in incorrect tree topologies. However, maximum likelihood
methods are particularly useful here. </small></li>

<li><small> <b>Rate variation within a single gene:</b> rates of nucleotide
substitution can vary along the length of a single gene - this also exacerbates
long branch attraction. </small></li>

<li><small> <b>Gene trees are not equivalent to species trees:</b> from simple
Mendelian genetics we know that genes segregate individually, and that
throughout time individual genes do not necessarily follow organismic genealogy
(<a href="#AviseWollenberg1997">Avise and Wollenberg 1997</a>). An obvious
example is the fact that while you may have brown eyes, your child may have the
genes for blue eyes - but that does not mean your child is not your descendent,
or that your brown-eyed children are more closely related to you than your
blue-eyed children. Including multiple genes in the analysis is a solution to
this conundrum. </small>

<p><small> However, it should be noted that a common assumption of all
molecular phylogenetic methods is that genes are transmitted via vertical
inheritance, i.e. from ancestor to descendant. If this assumption is violated,
then gene trees will never recapitulate an organismic phylogeny. This
assumption obviously is violated in instances of horizontal transfer, e.g. in
transformation of a bacterium by a DNA plasmid, or in retroviral insertion into
a host's genome. During the early evolution of life, before the advent of
multicellular organisms, horizontal transfer was likely very frequent (as it is
today in the observed evolution of bacteria and other unicellular organisms).
Thus, it is doubtful whether molecular methods are applicable, even in
principle, to resolving the phylogeny of the early evolution of life (near the
most recent common ancestor of all living organisms) (<a
href="#Doolittle1999">Doolittle 1999</a>; <a href="#Doolittle2000">Doolittle

<p> Although it is trivial to classify anything subjectively in a hierarchical
manner, only certain things can be classified <i>objectively</i> in a
consistent nested hierarchy. The difference drawn here between "subjective" and
"objective" is crucial and requires some elaboration, and it is best
illustrated by example. Different models of cars certainly could be classified
hierarchically - perhaps one could classify cars first by color, then within
each color by number of wheels, then within each wheel number by manufacturer,
etc. However, another individual may classify the same cars first by
manufacturer, then by size, then by year, then by color, etc. The particular
classification scheme chosen for the cars is subjective. In contrast, human
languages, which have common ancestors and are derived by descent with
modification, generally can be classified in objective nested hierarchies (<a
href="#Pei1949">Pei 1949</a>; <a href="#Ringe1999">Ringe 1999</a>). Nobody
would reasonably argue that Spanish should be categorized with German instead
of with Portugese. The difference between classifying cars and classifying
languages lies in the fact that, with cars, certain characters (for example,
color or manufacturer) must be considered more important than other characters
in order for the classification to work. Which types of car characters are more
important depends upon the personal preference of the individual who is
performing the classification. In other words, certain types of characters must
be weighted subjectively in order to classify cars in nested hierarchies; cars
do not fall into natural, unique, objective nested hierarchies. </p>

<p> Because of these facts, a cladistic analysis of cars will not produce a
unique, consistent, well-supported tree that displays nested hierarchies. A
cladistic analysis of cars (or, alternatively, a cladistic analysis of
imaginary organisms with randomly assigned characters) will of course result in
a phylogeny, but there will be a very large number of other phylogenies, many
of them with very different topologies, that are as well-supported by the same
data. In contrast, a cladistic analysis of organisms or languages will
generally result in a well-supported nested hierarchy, without arbitrarily
weighting certain characters (<a href="#Ringe1999">Ringe 1999</a>). Cladistic
analysis of a true genealogical process produces one or relatively few
phylogenetic trees that are much more well-supported by the data than the other
possible trees. </p>

<p> The degree to which a given phylogeny displays a unique, well-supported,
objective nested hierarchy can be rigorously quantified. Several different
statistical tests have been developed for determining whether a phylogeny has a
subjective or objective nested hierarchy, or whether a given nested hierarchy
could have been generated by a chance process instead of a genealogical process
(<a href="#Swofford_etal1996">Swofford 1996</a>, p. 504). These tests measure
the degree of "cladistic hierarchical structure" (also known as the
"phylogenetic signal") in a phylogeny, and phylogenies based upon true
genealogical processes give high values of hierarchical structure, whereas
subjective phylogenies that have only apparent hierarchical structure (like a
phylogeny of cars, for example) give low values (<a href="#Archie1989">Archie
1989</a>; <a href="#FaithCranston1991">Faith and Cranston 1991</a>; <a
href="#Farris1989">Farris 1989</a>; <a href="#Felsenstein1985">Felsenstein

href="#HillisHuelsenbeck1992">Hillis and Huelsenbeck 1992</a>; <a
href="#Huelsenbeck_etal2001">Huelsenbeck et al. 2001</a>; <a
href="#Klassen_etal1991">Klassen et al. 1991</a>). </p>

<p> There is one caveat to consider with this prediction: if rates of evolution
are fast, then cladistic information can be lost over time since it would be
essentially randomized. The faster the rate, the less time needed to obliterate
information about the historical branching pattern of evolution. Slowly
evolving characters let us see farther back into time; faster evolving
characters restrict that view to more recent events. If the rate of evolution
for a certain character is extremely slow, a nested hierarchy will be observed
for that character only for very distantly related taxa. However, "rate of
evolution" vs. "time since divergence" is relative; if common descent is true,
then in some time frame we will always be able to observe a nested hierarchy
for any given character. Furthermore, we know empirically that different
characters evolve at different rates (e.g. some genes have higher background
mutation rates than others). Thus, if common descent is true, we should observe
nested hierarchies over a broad range of time at various biological levels.
</p>

<p> Therefore, since common descent is a genealogical process, common descent
should produce organisms that can be organized into objective nested
hierarchies. Equivalently, we predict that, in general, cladistic analyses of
organisms should produce phylogenies that have large, statistically significant
values of hierarchical structure (in standard scientific practice, a result
with "high statistical significance" is a result that has a 1% probability or
less of occurring by chance [P &lt; 0.01]). As a representation of universal
common descent, the universal tree of life should have very high, very
significant hierarchical structure and phylogenetic signal. </p>

<h3>Confirmation:</h3>

<p> Most existing species can be organized rather easily in a nested
hierarchical classification. This is evident in the use of the Linnaean
classification scheme. Based on shared derived characters, closely related
organisms can be placed in one group (such as a genus), several genera can be
grouped together into one family, several families can be grouped together into
an order, etc. </p>

<p> As a specific example (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>), plants can be
classified as vascular and nonvascular (i.e. they have or lack xylem and
phloem). Nested within the vascular group, there are two divisions, seed and
non-seed plants. Further nested within the seed plants are two more groups, the
angiosperms (which have enclosed, protected seeds) and the gymnosperms (having
non-enclosed seeds). Within the angiosperm group are the monocotyledons and the
dicotyledons. </p>

<p> Most importantly, the standard phylogenetic tree and nearly all less
inclusive evolutionary phylogenies have statistically significant, high values
of hierarchical structure (<a href="#Baldauf_etal2000">Baldauf et al. 2000</a>;

<h3>Potential Falsification:</h3>

<p> It would be very problematic if many species were found that combined
characteristics of different nested groupings. Proceeding with the previous
example, some nonvascular plants could have seeds or flowers, like vascular
plants, but they do not. Gymnosperms (e.g. conifers or pines) occasionally
could be found with flowers, but they never are. Non-seed plants, like ferns,
could be found with woody stems; however, only some angiosperms have woody
stems. Conceivably, some birds could have mammary glands or hair; some mammals
could have feathers (they are an excellent means of insulation). Certain fish
or amphibians could have differentiated or cusped teeth, but these are only
characteristics of mammals. A mix and match of characters like this would make
it extremely difficult to objectively organize species into nested hierarchies.
Unlike organisms, cars <i>do</i> have a mix and match of characters, and this
is precisely why a nested hierarchy does not flow naturally from classification
of cars. </p>

<p> If it were impossible, or very problematic, to place species in an
objective nested classification scheme (as it is for the car, chair, book,
atomic element, and elementary particle examples mentioned above),
macroevolution would be effectively disproven. More precisely, if the
phylogenetic tree of all life gave statistically significant <i>low</i> values
of phylogenetic signal (hierarchical structure), common descent would be
resolutely falsified. In fact, it is possible to have a "reciprocal" pattern
from nested hierarchies. Mathematically, a nested hierarchy is the result of
specific correlations between certain characters of organisms. When
evolutionary rates are fast, characters become randomly distributed with
respect to one another, and the correlations are weakened. However, the
characters can also be anti-correlated - it is possible for them to be
correlated in the opposite direction from what produces nested hierarchies (<a
href="#Archie1989">Archie 1989</a>; <a href="#FaithCranston1991">Faith and
Cranston 1991</a>; <a href="#Hillis1991">Hillis 1991</a>; <a
href="#HillisHuelsenbeck1992">Hillis and Huelsenbeck 1992</a>; <a
href="#Klassen_etal1991">Klassen et al. 1991</a>). The observation of such an
anti-correlated pattern would be a strong falsification of common descent,
regardless of evolutionary rates. </p>

<p> As a specific example of the above - one widely used measure of cladistic
hierarchical structure is the <i>consistency index</i> (CI). The statistical
properties of the CI measure were investigated in a frequently cited paper by
Klassen et al. (<a href="#Klassen_etal1991">Klassen et al. 1991</a>; see <a
href="#fig1.2.1">Figure 1.2.1</a>). The exact CI value is dependent upon the
number of taxa in the phylogenetic tree under consideration. In this paper, the
authors calculated what values of CI were statistically significant for various
numbers of taxa. Higher values of CI indicate a greater degree of hierarchical
structure. As an example, a CI of 0.2 is expected from random data for 20 taxa.
A value of 0.3 is, however, highly statistically significant. Most interesting
for the present point is the fact that a CI of 0.1 for 20 taxa is also highly
statistically significant, but it is too <i>low</i> - it is indicative of
anti-cladistic structure. Klassen et al. took 75 CI values from published
cladograms in 1989 (combined from three papers) and noted how they fared in
terms of statistical significance. The cladograms used from 5 to 49 different
taxa (i.e. different species). Three of the 75 cladograms fell within the 95%
confidence limits for random data, which means that they were indistinguishable
from random data. All the rest exhibited highly statistically significant
values of CI. None exhibited significant <i>low</i> values; none displayed an
anti-correlated, anti-hierarchical pattern. And note, this study was performed
before there were measures of statistical significance which would allow
researchers to "weed out" the bad cladograms. Predictably, the three "bad" data
sets considered under ten taxa - it is of course more difficult to determine
statistical significance with very little data. Seventy-two independent studies
from different researchers on different organisms and genes with high values of
CI (P &gt; 0.01) is an incredible confirmation with an astronomical degree of
combined statistical significance. If the reverse were true - if studies such
as this gave statistically significant values of CI (i.e. cladistic
hierarchical structure) which were lower than that expected from random data -
common descent would have been firmly falsified. </p>

<p> Keep in mind that ~1.5 million species are known, and that the majority of
these species has been discovered since Darwin first stated his hypothesis of
common ancestry. Even so, they all have fit the correct hierarchical pattern
within the error of our methods. Furthermore, it is estimated that only 1 to
10% of all living species has even been catalogued, let alone studied in
detail. New species discoveries pour in daily, and each one is a test of the
theory of common descent (<a href="#Wilson1992">Wilson 1992</a>, Ch. 8).<br />
</p>

<h2><a id="pred3" name="pred3"></a><a id="independent_convergence"
name="independent_convergence"></a>Prediction 1.3: Convergence of independent
phylogenies</h2>

<p> If there is one true historical phylogenetic tree which unites all species
in an objective genealogy, all separate lines of evidence should converge on
the same tree (<a href="#Penny_etal1982">Penny et al. 1982</a>; <a
href="#Penny_etal1991">Penny et al. 1991</a>). Independently derived
phylogenetic trees of all organisms should match each other with a high degree
of statistical significance. </p>

<h3>Confirmation:</h3>

<p> Many genes with very basic cellular functions are ubiquitous &ndash; they
occur in the genomes of most or all organisms. An oft-cited example, which I
will use frequently, is the cytochrome <i>c</i> gene. Since all eukaryotes
contain the gene for this essential protein, neither its presence nor its
function correlates with organismal morphology. Additionally, because of the
fact of DNA coding redundancy, parts of certain DNA sequences have absolutely
no correlation with phenotype (e.g. certain introns or the four-fold degenerate
third-base position of most DNA codons). Due to these two aspects of certain
DNA sequences, ubiquity and redundancy, DNA sequences can be carefully chosen
that constitute completely independent data from morphology. (See <a
href="section4.html#protein_redundancy" target="_blank">point 17</a> and <a
href="section4.html#DNA_redundancy" target="_blank">18</a> for more background about
the molecular sequence evidence and for more detail about how it is independent
of morphology.) It turns out that the phylogenetic tree determined by
morphological analysis indeed matches closely the phylogenetic tree constructed
from morphologically independent protein, DNA, and ribosomal RNA sequences. The
degree of congruence between these independently derived phylogenies is
extremely high, in terms of statistical significance. </p>

<p> In science, independent measurements of some value (such as a physical
constant like the charge of the electron, the mass of the proton, or the speed
of light) are never exact. There always exists some error in the measurement,
and all independent measurements are incongruent to some extent. Of course, the
true value of something is never known for certain - all we have are
measurements that we hope approximate the true value. Scientifically, then, the
important relevant questions are "When comparing two measurements, how much of
a discrepancy does it take to be a problem?" and "How close must the
measurements be in order to give a strong confirmation?" Scientists answer
these questions with probability and statistics. Some measurements match with
statistical significance, some do not. </p>

<p> So, how well do phylogenetic trees from morphological studies match the
trees made from independent molecular studies? There are over 10<sup>41</sup>
different possible ways to arrange the 30 major taxa represented in <a
href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> into a phylogenetic tree (<a
href="#Felsenstein1982">Felsenstein 1982</a>; <a href="#Li1997">Li 1997</a>, p.
102). In spite of the odds, the exact relationships given in Figure 1 were
independently determined from morphological characters and from cytochrome
<i>c</i> molecular studies (for consensus phylogenies from pre-molecular
studies see <a href="#Carter1954">Carter 1954</a>, Figure 1, p. 13; <a
href="#Dodson1960">Dodson 1960</a>, Figures 43, p. 125, and Figure 50, p. 150;
<a href="#Osborn1918">Osborn 1918</a>, Figure 42, p. 161; <a
href="#Haeckel1898">Haeckel 1898</a>, p. 55; <a href="#Gregory1951">Gregory
1951</a>, Fig. opposite title page; for phylogenies from the early cytochrome
<i>c</i> studies see <a href="#McLaughlinDayhoff1973">McLaughlin and Dayhoff
1973</a>; <a href="#DickersonTimkovich1975">Dickerson and Timkovich 1975</a>,
pp. 438-439). Speaking quantitatively, independent morphological and molecular
measurements such as these have determined the standard phylogenetic tree, as
shown in Figure 1, to better than 41 decimal places. This phenomenal
corroboration of macroevolutionary theory is referred to as the "twin nested
hierarchy." </p>

<p> In general, phylogenetic trees may be incongruent (i.e., some of the
branches may not match), while still retaining an extremely high degree of
statistical significance (<a href="#Hendy_etal1984">Hendy et al. 1984</a>; <a
href="#Penny_etal1982">Penny et al. 1982</a>; <a href="#PennyHendy1986">Penny
and Hendy 1986</a>; <a href="#SteelPenny1993">Steel and Penny 1993</a>). Even
for a phylogeny with a small number of organisms, the total number of possible
trees is extremely large. For example, there are about a thousand different
possible phylogenies for only six organisms; for nine organisms, there are
millions of possible phylogenies; for 12 organisms, there are nearly 14
trillion different possible phylogenies (<a href="#Felsenstein1982">Felsenstein
1982</a>; <a href="#Li1997">Li 1997</a>, p. 102). Thus, the probability of
finding two similar trees by chance via two independent methods is extremely
small in most cases. In fact, two different trees of 16 organisms that mismatch
by as many as 10 branches still match with high statistical significance (<a
href="#Hendy_etal1984">Hendy et al. 1984</a>, Table 4; <a
href="#SteelPenny1993">Steel and Penny 1993</a>). </p>

<p> The stunning degree of match between even the most incongruent phylogenetic
trees found in the biological literature is widely unappreciated, mainly
because most people (including many scientists) are unaware of the mathematics
involved (<a href="#Penny_etal1982">Penny et al. 1982</a>; <a
href="#PennyHendy1986">Penny and Hendy 1986</a>). To put the significance of
this incredible confirmation in perspective, consider the modern theory of
gravity. Both Newton's Theory of Universal Gravitation and Einstein's General
Theory of Relativity rely upon a fundamental physical constant,
<i><b>G</b></i>, the gravitational constant. If these theories of gravity are
correct, independent methods should determine similar values for
<i><b>G</b></i>. However, to date, very precise independent measurements of the
gravitational constant <i><b>G</b></i> disagree by nearly 1% (<a
href="#Kestenbaum1998">Kestenbaum 1998</a>; <a href="#Quinn2000">Quinn
2000</a>). Here is how David Kestenbaum describes the current scientific status
of the theory of gravity, as reported in the prestigious journal

<p> Nevertheless, a disagreement of just under 1% is still pretty good; it is
not enough, at this point, to cause us to cast much doubt upon the validity and
usefulness of modern theories of gravity. However, if tests of the theory of
common descent performed that poorly, the standard phylogenetic trees
independently determined by morphological and molecular methods would have to
differ by more than 25 branches (out of 30)! In their quest for scientific
perfection, some biologists are rightly rankled at the very minor discrepancies
between some phylogenetic trees (<a href="#Gura2000">Gura 2000</a>; <a
href="#Patterson_etal1993">Patterson et al. 1993</a>; <a
href="#MaleyMarshall1998">Maley and Marshall 1998</a>); however, the standard
phylogenetic tree is known with much greater precision and accuracy than even
the most well-determined physical constants (e.g., the charge of the electron
is known to only seven decimal places, the Planck constant is known to eight
decimal places, and the mass of the neutron, proton, and electron are all known
to nine decimal places). </p>

<p> Furthermore, if common descent is true, we expect that including more data
in phylogenetic analyses will increase the correspondence between phylogenetic
trees. As explained in the <a href="#box2">phylogenetic caveats sidebar</a>,
gene trees are not equivalent to species trees (<a
href="#AviseWollenberg1997">Avise and Wollenberg 1997</a>). Genetics and
heredity are stochastic (i.e. probabilistic) processes, and consequently we
expect that phylogenies constructed with single genes will be partially
incongruent. However, including multiple independent genes in a phylogenetic
analysis should circumvent this difficulty. Phylogenetic trees constructed with
multiple genes should thus be more accurate than those constructed with single
genes, and indeed combined gene trees are more congruent (<a
href="#Baldauf_etal2000">Baldauf et al. 2000</a>; <a href="#Hedges1994">Hedges
1994</a>; <a href="#HedgesPoling1999">Hedges and Poling 1999</a>; <a
href="#Penny_etal1982">Penny et al. 1982</a>). </p>

<h3>Potential Falsification:</h3>

<p> When it became possible to sequence biological molecules, the realization
of a markedly different tree based on the independent molecular evidence would
have been a fatal blow to the theory of evolution, even though that is by far
the most likely result. More precisely, the common descent hypothesis would
have been falsified if the universal phylogenetic trees determined from the
independent molecular and morphological evidence did not match with statistical
significance. Furthermore, we are now in a position to begin construction of
phylogenetic trees based on other independent lines of data, such as
chromosomal organization. In a very general sense, chromosome number and length
and the chromosomal position of genes are all causally independent of both
morphology and of sequence identity. Phylogenies constructed from these data
should recapitulate the standard phylogenetic tree as well (<a
href="#Hillis_etal1996">Hillis et al. 1996</a>; <a href="#Li1997">Li 1997</a>).
</p>

<p> One common objection is the assertion that anatomy is not independent of
biochemistry, and thus anatomically similar organisms are likely to be similar
biochemically (e.g. in their molecular sequences) simply for functional
reasons. According to this argument, then, we should expect phylogenies based
on molecular sequences to be similar to phylogenies based on morphology even if
organisms are not related by common descent. This argument is very wrong. There
is no known biological reason, besides common descent, to suppose that similar
morphologies must have similar biochemistry. Though this logic may seem quite
reasonable initially, all of molecular biology refutes this "common sense"
correlation. In general, similar DNA and biochemistry give similar morphology
and function, but the converse is not true - similar morphology and function is
not necessarily the result of similar DNA or biochemistry. The reason is easily
understood once explained; many very different DNA sequences or biochemical
structures can result in the same functions and the same morphologies (see <a
href="section4.html#protein_redundancy" target="_blank">predictions 4.1</a> and
<a href="section4.html#DNA_redundancy" target="_blank">4.2</a> for a detailed
explanation). </p>

<p> As a close analogy, consider computer programs. Netscape works essentially
the same on a Macintosh, an IBM, or a Unix machine, but the binary code for
each program is quite different. Computer programs that perform the same
functions can be written in most any computer language - Basic, Fortran, C,
C++, Java, Pascal, etc. and identical programs can be compiled into binary code
many different ways. Furthermore, even using the same computer language, there
are many different ways to write any specific computer program, even using the
same algorithms and subroutines. In the end, there is no reason to suspect that
similar computer programs are written with similar code, based solely on the
function of the program. This is the reason why software companies keep their
source code secret, but they don't care that competitors can use their programs
- it is essentially impossible to deduce the program code from the function and
operation of the software. The same conclusion applies to biological organisms,
for very similar reasons. </p>

<p> To reiterate, although similar genotypes (e.g. molecular sequences) often
give similar phenotypes (e.g. morphological characters), similar phenotypes are
not necessarily the result of similar genotypes. Thus, it is entirely possible
that phylogenetic trees constructed from genotypic data could be radically
different from phylogenetic trees constructed from phenotypic data. In fact, in
the absence of common descent or any other reason to suppose that these two
types of trees should be similar, the most likely result by far is that they
will be radically different. This is precisely why it is possible to falsify
the macroevolutionary prediction that independently derived phylogenies should
be similar.<br /> </p>

name="morphological_intermediates"></a>Prediction 1.4: Intermediate and
transitional forms: the possible morphologies of predicted common ancestors</h2>

<p> Any fossilized animals found should conform to the standard phylogenetic
tree. If all organisms are united by descent from a common ancestor, then there
is one single true historical phylogeny for all organisms, just like there is
one single true historical genealogy for any individual human. It directly
follows that if there is one true phylogeny, then all organisms fit in that
phylogeny uniquely. In other words, all organisms, both past (e.g. fossils) and
present, must conform to the true phylogeny. Since the standard phylogenetic
tree is the best approximation of the true historical phylogeny, we expect that
all fossilized animals should conform to the standard phylogenetic tree within
the error of our scientific methods. </p>

<p> Every node shared between two branches in a phylogeny or cladogram
represents a predicted common ancestor; thus there are ~29 common ancestors
predicted from the tree shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. Our standard
tree shows that the bird grouping is most closely related to the reptilian
grouping, with a node linking the two (A in Figure 1); thus we predict the
possibility of finding fossil <a href="glossary.html#intermediate"
target="_blank">intermediates</a> between birds and reptiles. The same
reasoning applies to mammals and reptiles (B in Figure 1). However, we predict
that we should never find fossil intermediates between birds and mammals. </p>

<p> It should be pointed out that there is no requirement for intermediate
organisms to go extinct. In fact, all living organisms can be thought of as
intermediate between adjacent taxa in a phylogenetic tree. For instance, modern
reptiles are intermediate between amphibians and mammals, and reptiles are also
intermediate between amphibians and birds. As far as macroevolutionary
predictions of morphology are concerned, this point is trivial, as it is
essentially just a restatement of the concept of a nested hierarchy. </p>

<p> However, a phylogenetic tree does make significant predictions about the
morphology of intermediates which no longer exist or which have yet to be
discovered. Each predicted common ancestor has a set of explicitly specified
morphological characteristics, based on each of the most common derived
characters of its descendants and based upon the transitions that must have
occurred to transform one taxa into another (<a
href="#Cunningham_etal1998">Cunningham et al. 1998</a>; <a
href="#Futuyma1998">Futuyma 1998</a>, pp. 107-108). From the knowledge of avian
and reptilian morphology, it is possible to predict some of the characteristics
that a reptile-bird intermediate should have, if found. Therefore, while
pterodactyl fossils are not considered possible candidates for reptile-bird
intermediates (<a href="#Futuyma1998">Futuyma 1998</a>, pp. 154-155), we do
expect the possibility of finding reptile-like fossils with feathers, bird-like
fossils with teeth, or bird-like fossils with long reptilian tails. </p>

1990</a>; <a href="#Kardong2002">Kardong 2002</a>, pp. 255-275). As mentioned
above, the standard phylogenetic tree indicates that mammals gradually evolved
from a reptile-like ancestor, and that transitional species must have existed
which were morphologically intermediate between reptiles and mammals - even
though none are found living today. However, there are significant
morphological differences between modern reptiles and modern mammals. Bones, of
course, are what fossilize most readily, and that is where we look for
transitional species from the past. Osteologically, two major striking
differences exist between reptiles and mammals: (1) reptiles have at least four
bones in the lower jaw (e.g. the dentary, articular, angular, surangular, and
coronoid), while mammals have only one (the dentary), and (2) reptiles have
only one middle ear bone (the stapes), while mammals have three (the hammer,
anvil, and stapes) (see Figure 1.4.1). Early in the 20<sup>th</sup> century,
developmental biologists discovered something that further complicates the
picture. In the reptilian fetus, two developing bones from the head eventually
form two bones in the reptilian lower jaw, the quadrate and the articular (see
the Pelycosaur in Figure 1.4.1). Surprisingly, the corresponding developing
bones in the mammalian fetus eventually form the anvil and hammer of the unique
mammalian middle ear (also known more formally as the incus and malleus,
respectively; see Figure 1.4.2) (<a href="#Gilbert1997">Gilbert 1997</a>, pp.
894-896). These facts strongly indicated that the hammer and anvil had evolved
from these reptilian jawbones - that is, if common descent was in fact true.
This result was so striking, and the required intermediates so outlandish, that
many anatomists had extreme trouble imagining how transitional forms bridging
these morphologies could have existed while retaining function. Young-earth
creationist Duane Gish stated the problem this way: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" cellpadding="10" summary="">
<tr>
<td>

<p> "All mammals, living or fossil, have a single bone, the dentary, on each
side of the lower jaw, and all mammals, living or fossil, have three auditory
ossicles or ear bones, the malleus, incus and stapes. ... Every reptile, living
or fossil, however, has at least four bones in the lower jaw and only one
auditory ossicle, the stapes. ... There are no transitional fossil forms
showing, for instance, three or two jawbones, or two ear bones. No one has
explained yet, for that matter, how the transitional form would have managed to
chew while his jaw was being unhinged and rearticulated, or how he would hear
while dragging two of his jaw bones up into his ear." (<a href="#Gish1978">Gish

<p> Gish was incorrect in stating that there were no transitional fossil forms,
and he has been corrected on this gaff numerous times since he wrote these
words. However, Gish's statements nicely delineate the morphological conundrum
at hand. Let's review the required evolutionary conclusion. During their
evolution, two mammalian middle ear bones (the hammer and anvil, <i>aka</i>
malleus and incus) were derived from two reptilian jawbones. Thus there was a
major evolutionary transition in which several reptilian jawbones (the
quadrate, articular, and angular) were extensively reduced and modified
gradually to form the modern mammalian middle ear. At the same time, the
dentary bone, a part of the reptilian jaw, was expanded to form the major
mammalian lower jawbone. During the course of this change, the bones that form
the hinge joint of the jaw changed identity. Importantly, the reptilian jaw
joint is formed at the intersection of the quadrate and articular whereas the
mammalian jaw joint is formed at the intersection of the squamosal and dentary
(see Figure 1.4.1). </p>

<p> How could hearing and jaw articulation be preserved during this transition?
As clearly shown from the many transitional fossils that have been found (see
Figure 1.4.3), the bones that transfer sound in the reptilian and mammalian ear
were in contact with each other throughout the evolution of this transition. In
reptiles, the stapes contacts the quadrate, which in turn contacts the
articular. In mammals, the stapes contacts the incus, which in turn contacts
the malleus (see Figure 1.4.2). Since the quadrate evolved into the incus, and
the articular evolved into the malleus, these three bones were in constant
contact during this impressive evolutionary change. Furthermore, a functional
jaw joint was maintained by redundancy - several of the intermediate fossils
have <i>both</i> a reptilian jaw joint (from the quadrate and articular)
<i>and</i> a mammalian jaw joint (from the dentary and squamosal). Several late
cynodonts and <i>Morganucodon</i> clearly have a double-jointed jaw. In this
way, the reptilian-style jaw joint was freed to evolve a new specialized
function in the middle ear. It is worthy of note that some modern species of
snakes have a double-jointed jaw involving different bones, so such a
mechanical arrangement is certainly possible and functional. </p>

<p> Since Figure 1.4.3 was made, several important intermediate fossils have
been discovered that fit between <i>Morganucodon</i> and the earliest mammals.
These new discoveries include a complete skull of <i>Hadrocodium wui</i> (<a
href="#Luo_etal2001">Luo et al. 2001</a>) and cranial and jaw material from
<i>Repenomamus</i> and <i>Gobiconodon</i> (<a href="#Wang_etal2001">Wang et al.

incus, and angular completely detached from the lower jaw and became solely
auditory ear ossicles. </p>

<p> Recall that Gish stated: "There are no transitional fossil forms showing,
for instance, three or two jawbones, or two ear bones" (<a
href="#Gish1978">Gish 1978</a>, p. 80). Gish simply does not understand how
gradual transitions happen (something he should understand, obviously, if he
intends to criticize evolutionary theory). These fossil intermediates
illustrate why Gish's statement is a gross mischaracterization of how a
transitional form should look. In several of the known intermediates, the bones
have overlapping functions, and one bone can be called both an ear bone and a
jaw bone; these bones serve two functions. Thus, there is no reason to expect
transitional forms with intermediate numbers of jaw bones or ear bones. For
example, in <i>Morganucodon</i>, the quadrate (anvil) and the articular
(hammer) serve as mammalian-style ear bones <i>and</i> reptilian jaw bones
simultaneously. In fact, even in modern reptiles the quadrate and articular
serve to transmit sound to the stapes and the inner ear (see Figure 1.4.2). The
relevant transition, then, is a process where the ear bones, initially located
in the lower jaw, become specialized in function by eventually detaching from
the lower jaw and moving closer to the inner ear. </p>

whales</i></h3>

<p> Another impressive example of incontrovertible transitional forms predicted
to exist by evolutionary biologists is the collection of <a
href="http://www.talkorigins.org/features/whales/" target="_blank">land
mammal-to-whale fossil intermediates</a>. Whales, of course, are sea animals
with flippers. Since they are also mammals, the consensus phylogeny indicates
that whales and dolphins evolved from land mammals with legs. In recent years,
we have found several transitional forms of whales with legs, both capable and
incapable of terrestrial locomotion. </p>

<p> There are many other examples such as these - most can be found in the
excellent <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-transitional.html"
target="_blank">Transitional Vertebrate Fossils FAQ</a>. </p>

<h3>Potential Falsification:</h3>

<p> Any finding of a striking half-mammal, half-bird intermediate would be
highly inconsistent with common descent. Many other examples of prohibited
intermediates can be thought of, based on the standard tree (<a
href="#Kemp1982">Kemp 1982</a>; <a href="#Stanley1993">Stanley 1993</a>; <a
href="#Carroll1997">Carroll 1997</a>; <a href="#Chaterjee1997">Chaterjee
1997</a>). </p>

<p> A subtle, yet important point is that a strict cladistic evolutionary
interpretation precludes the possibility of identifying true ancestors; only
intermediates or transitionals can be positively identified. (For the purposes
of this article, transitionals and intermediates are considered synonymous.)
The only incontrovertible evidence for an ancestor-descendant relationship is
the observation of a birth; obviously this is normally rather improbable in the
fossil record. Intermediates are not necessarily the same as the exact
predicted ancestors; in fact, it is rather unlikely that they would be the
same. Simply due to probability considerations, the intermediates that we find
will most likely not be the true ancestors of any modern species, but will be
closely related to the predicted common ancestor. The minor implication
concerning fossil intermediates is that the intermediates we do find will
likely have additional derived characters besides the characters that
identified them as intermediates. Because of these considerations, when a new
and important intermediate fossil species is discovered, careful
paleontologists will often note that the transitional species under study is
probably not an ancestor, but rather is an evolutionary "side-branch." For
further clarification see <a href="section5.html#strange_past"
target="_blank">prediction 5.4</a>.<br
/> </p>

<h2><a id="pred5" name="pred5"></a><a id="chronology"
name="chronology"></a>Prediction 1.5: Chronological order of intermediates</h2>

<p> Fossilized intermediates should appear in the correct general chronological
order based on the standard tree. Any phylogenetic tree predicts a relative
chronological order of the evolution of hypothetical common ancestors and
intermediates between these ancestors. For instance, in our current example,
the reptile-mammal common ancestor (B) and intermediates should be older than
the reptile-bird common ancestor (A) and intermediates. </p>

<p> Note, however, that there is some "play" within the temporal constraints
demanded by any phylogeny, for two primary reasons: (1) the statistical
confidence (or conversely, the error) associated with a phylogeny and its
specific internal branches, and (2) the inherent resolution of the fossil
record (ultimately stemming from the vagaries of the fossilization process). As
mentioned earlier, most phylogenetic trees have some branches with high
confidence, because they are well-supported by the data, and other branches in
which we have less confidence, because they are statistically less significant
and poorly supported by the data. See also the <a href="#box2">caveats</a>
associated with phylogenetic analysis. </p>

<p> When evaluating the geological order of fossils, remember that once a
transitional species appears there is no reason why it <i>must</i> become
extinct and be replaced. For instance, some organisms have undergone little
change in as much as 100 to 200 million years in rare cases. Some familiar
examples are the "living fossils," such as the coelacanth, which has persisted
for approximately 80 million years; the bat, which has not changed much in the
past 50 million years; and even the modern tree squirrel, which has not changed
in 35 million years. In fact, paleontological studies indicate the average
longevity of 21 living families of vertebrates is approximately 70 million
years (<a href="#Carroll1997">Carroll 1997</a>, p. 167). </p>

<p> Furthermore, the fossil record is demonstrably incomplete; species appear
in the fossil record, then disappear, then reappear later. An exceptional
instance is the coelacanth, which last appeared in the fossil record 80 million
years ago, yet it is alive today. During the Cretaceous (a critical time in
bird evolution), there is a 50 million-year gap in the diplodocoidean record,
greater than a 40 million-year gap in the pachycephalosaurian record, greater
than a 20 million-year gap in the trodontidiae, and about a 15 million-year gap
in the oviraptosaurian fossil record (both of these last two orders of
dinosaurs are maniraptoran coelurosaurian theropods, which figure significantly
in the evolution of birds). During the Jurassic, there is a 40 million-year gap
in the fossil record of the heterodontosauridae (<a href="#Sereno1999">Sereno
1999</a>). Most organisms do not fossilize, and there is no reason why a
representative of some species must be found in the fossil record. As every
graduate student in scientific research knows (or eventually learns, perhaps
the hard way), arguments based upon negative evidence are very weak scientific
arguments, especially in the absence of proper positive controls. Thus, based
on the fossil remains of modern species and the known gaps in the current
paleontological records of extinct species, the observation of transitional
species "out of order" by 40 million years should be fairly common. This degree
of "play" in the fossil record is actually rather minor, considering that the
fossil record of life spans between 2 to 3.8 billion years and that of
multicellular organisms encompasses a total of ~660 million years. An
uncertainty of 40 million years is equivalent to about a 1% or 6% relative
error, respectively - rather small overall. </p>

<h3><a id="chronology_conf" name="chronology_conf"></a>Confirmation:</h3>

<p> The reptile-bird intermediates mentioned above date from the Upper Jurassic
and Lower Cretaceous (about 150 million years ago), whereas pelycosauria and
therapsida (reptile-mammal intermediates) are older and date from the
Carboniferous and the Permian (about 250 to 350 million years ago, see <a
href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/timescale.html" target="_blank">the
Geological Time Scale</a>). This is precisely what should be observed if the
fossil record matches the standard phylogenetic tree. </p>

<p> The most scientifically rigorous method of confirming this prediction is to
demonstrate a positive corellation between phylogeny and stratigraphy, i.e. a
positive corellation between the order of taxa in a phylogenetic tree and the
geological order in which those taxa first appear and last appear (whether for
living or extinct intermediates). For instance, within the error inherent in
the fossil record, prokaryotes should appear first, followed by simple
multicellular animals like sponges and starfish, then lampreys, fish,
amphibians, reptiles, mammals, etc., as shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>.
Contrary to the erroneous (and unreferenced) opinions of some
anti-evolutionists (e.g. <a href="#Wise1994">Wise 1994</a>, p. 225-226),
studies from the past ten years addressing this very issue have confirmed that
there is indeed a positive corellation between phylogeny and stratigraphy, with
statistical significance (<a href="#Benton1998">Benton 1998</a>; <a

href="#NorellNovacek1992b">Norell and Novacek 1992b</a>; <a
href="#Wills1999">Wills 1999</a>). Using three different measures of
phylogeny-stratigraphy correlation [the RCI, GER, and SCI (<a
href="http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/cladestrat/Gho2.html" target="_blank">Ghosts
2.4 software</a>, Wills 1999)], a high positive correlation was found between
the standard phylogenetic tree portrayed in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> and
the stratigraphic range of the same taxa, with very high statistical
significance (P &lt; 0.0001) (this work, <i>Ghosts</i> input file available
upon request). </p>

<p> As another specific example, an early analysis published in <i>Science</i>
by Mark Norell and Michael Novacek (<a href="#NorellNovacek1992b">Norell and
Novacek 1992b</a>) examined 24 different taxa of vertebrates (teleosts,
amniotes, reptiles, synapsids, diapsids, lepidosaurs, squamates, two orders of
dinosaurs, two orders of hadrosaurs, pachycephalosaurs, higher mammals,
primates, rodents, ungulates, artiodactyls, ruminants, elephantiformes,
brontotheres, tapiroids, chalicotheres, Chalicotheriinae, and equids). For each
taxa, the phylogenetic position of known fossils was compared with the
stratigraphic position of the same fossils. A positive correlation was found
for <i>all</i> of the 24 taxa, 18 of which were statistically significant. Note
that the correlation theoretically could have been negative. A statistically
significant negative correlation would indicate that, in general, organisms
rooted deeply in the phylogeny are found in more recent strata - a strong
macroevolutionary inconsistency. However, no negative correlations were
observed. </p>

<p> As a third example, Michael Benton and Rebecca Hitchin published a more
recent, greatly expanded, and detailed stratigraphic analysis of 384 published
cladograms of various multicellular organisms (<a
href="#BentonHitchin1997">Benton and Hitchin 1997</a>). Using the three
measures of congruence between the fossil record and phylogeny mentioned above
(the RCI, GER, and SCI), these researchers observed values "skewed so far from
a normal distribution [i.e. randomness] that they provide evidence for strong
congruence of the two datasets [fossils and cladograms]." Furthermore, Benton
and Hitchin's analysis was extremely conservative, since they made no effort to
exclude cladograms with poor resolution or to exclude cladograms with very
small numbers of taxa. Including both of these types of cladograms will add
confounding random elements to the analysis and will decrease the apparent
concordance between stratigraphy and cladograms. Even so, the results were
overall extremely statistically significant (P &lt; 0.0005). As the authors
comment in their discussion: </p>

<blockquote>
<table class="grey" cellpadding="10" summary="Benton and Hitchin 1997 comment
on the strong congruence found between the fossil record and phylogenetic
analyses">
<tr>
<td>

<p> "... the RCI and SCI metrics showed impressive left-skewing; the majority
of cladograms tested show good congruence between cladistic and stratigraphic
information. Cladists and stratigraphers may breathe easy: the cladistic method
appears, on the whole, to be finding phylogenies that may be close to the true
phylogeny of life, and the sequence of fossils in the rocks is not misleading.
... it would be hard to explain why the independent evidence of the
stratigraphic occurrence of fossils and the patterns of cladograms should show
such striking levels of congruence if the fossil record and the cladistic
method were hopelessly misleading." (<a href="#BentonHitchin1997">Benton and
Hitchin 1997</a>, p. 889) </p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> Additionally, if the correlation between phylogeny and stratigraphy is due
to common descent, we would expect the correlation to improve over longer
geological time frames (since the relative error associated with the fossil
record decreases). This is in fact observed (<a href="#Benton_etal1999">Benton
et al. 1999</a>). We also would expect the correlation to improve, not to get
worse, as more fossils are discovered, and this has also been observed (<a
href="#BentonStorrs1994">Benton and Storrs 1994</a>). </p>

<h3>Potential Falsification:</h3>

<p> It would be highly inconsistent if the chronological order were reversed in
the reptile-bird and reptile-mammal example. More generally, the strongest
falsification of this prediction would be the finding that there was a
<i>negative</i> correlation between stratigraphy and the phylogenetic tree that
describes the genealogical relatedness of all living organisms. Even the
finding that there was no overall correlation, neither positive nor negative,
between stratigraphy and the consensus phylogeny of the major taxa would be
very problematic for the theory of common descent. In addition, the observed
correlation could decrease over longer time frames or as we acquire more
paleontological data - but neither is the case (<a
href="#Benton_etal1999">Benton et al. 1999</a>; <a
href="#BentonStorrs1994">Benton and Storrs 1994</a>). </p>

<p> Based on the high confidence in certain branches of phylogenetic trees,
some temporal constraints are extremely rigid. For example, we should never
find mammalian or avian fossils in or before Devonian deposits, before reptiles
had diverged from the amphibian tetrapod line. This excludes Precambrian,
Cambrian, Ordovician, and Silurian deposits, encompassing 92% of the earth's
geological history and 65% of the biological history of multicellular
organisms. Even one incontrovertible find of any pre-Devonian mammal, bird, or
flower would shatter the theory of common descent (<a href="#Kemp1982">Kemp
1982</a>; <a href="#Carroll1988">Carroll 1988</a>; <a
