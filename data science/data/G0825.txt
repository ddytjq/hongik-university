In the infrared, astronomers can gather information about the universe as
it was a very long time ago and study the early evolution of galaxies.   
Although light travels extremely fast (186,000 miles per
second) the universe is so incredibly vast that it can take up to billions
of years for light to reach us.  The farther away an object is, the
farther in the past we see it.  For example, it takes light about 8 minutes
to reach us from our Sun, so solar astronomers see the Sun as it was 8 minutes
ago. If a large flare started this second, they would not see it for
another 8 minutes.  Light from the nearest star takes about 4.3 years to 
reach us, and light from the center of our own galaxy takes about 25,000 
years to reach us.  The billions of galaxies outside our own galaxy range in 
distance from hundreds of thousands to billions of light years away.  For
the most distant galaxies, we see them as they were billions of years ago.

As a result of the Big Bang (the tremendous explosion which marked the
beginning of our Universe), the universe is expanding and most of the
galaxies within it are moving away from each other. Astronomers have
discovered that all distant galaxies are moving away from us and that the
farther away they are, the faster they are moving. This recession of galaxies
away from us has an interesting effect on the light emitted from these
galaxies. When an object is moving away from us, the light that it emits is
"redshifted". This means that the wavelengths get longer and thereby shifted
towards the red part of the spectrum. 
This effect, called the Doppler effect, is similar to what happens to sound
waves emitted from a moving object.  For example, if you are standing
next to a railroad track and a train passes you while blowing its horn,
you will hear the sound change from a higher to a lower frequency as 
the train passes you by.
As a result of this Doppler effect, at large redshifts, all of the ultraviolet
and visible light from distant sources is shifted into the infrared part of the
spectrum. This means that infrared studies can give us much information about
the ultraviolet and visible spectra of very young, distant galaxies.
The image on the left is an infrared view of some of the farthest galaxies 
ever seen.  It was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope's NICMOS camera.

In 1965, the remnant radiation from the Big Bang  was discovered by
radio astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson.
This radiation, which peaks at 3 K (-454 degrees Fahrenheit) can be found
in all directions in space.  Astronomers believe that this radiation 
was much hotter in the past and that it should behave like a "blackbody"
(an object that is perfectly black because it absorbs all of the electromagnetic
radiation that reaches it).
To prove this, additional data were needed.
In 1975, infrared observations made from a balloon flight proved that the
Cosmic Background Radiation follows a blackbody curve. 
<p>
Additional studies
of the Cosmic Background Radiation were done using the
<a href="http://space.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/cobe/">COBE</a>
satellite which was launched in
1989.  COBE discovered that the background radiation is not entirely smooth
and shows extremely small variations in temperature.  These small 
temperature differences may be due to variations in the density of the
early universe which may have led to the formation of galaxies.
<p>
Infrared studies have also found a potential protogalaxy
(a galaxy in the process of formation) more than 15 billion light years from
Earth.  This object, named IRAS 10214+4724, may be a huge, contracting
hydrogen cloud just beginning to shine with newborn stars.  This is close to
the edge of the observable universe and its light has taken since nearly the
beginning of the universe to reach us.  Protogalaxies provide us with a look
at the era when galaxies were first coming to life.
