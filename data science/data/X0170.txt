      <h2 align="center"><!-- #BeginEditable "text" -->HuntGuide.Com Visits Southern 
        Farms<!-- #EndEditable --></h2>
      <!-- #BeginEditable "article%20text" -->After adding the Southern Farms 
      account I was quick to notice the potential of this trophy Whitetail operation. 
      When Troy invited Kirk Fox (co-owner of HuntGuide.Com) and myself to go 
      on a hunt, we eagerly accepted. 
      <p>Our trip began with a brief flight from Harrisburg to Atlanta, and then 
        a quick 30 minute connection to Columbus, Georgia. Troy was waiting for 
        us at the airport. Southern Farms is happy to provide airport pickup for 
        those guests who choose to fly. As we made the 1 hour drive to the lodge 
        Troy shared a lot of information about his hunting operation. Southern 
        Farms was founded in 1993, and started out as a 300 acre lease. Since 
        then it has grown into a full scale trophy whitetail operation. They now 
        have exclusive hunting rights to over 6000 acres of prime whitetail habitat. 
        This land consists of 1500 acres of farm land, 2500 acres of swamp / clear 
        cuts, and 2000 acres of hardwoods. 35 food plots are also maintained on 
        the property. 50 tree stands are strategically located through out the 
        property. They are a combination of ladder stands, tripods, and Texas 
        tower stands. All of them are built by Troy and his staff. They are very 
        comfortable and have shooting rests. In addition to these stands, some 
        climbing stands are also located on the property. </p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/images_articles/southernfrm_lodge.jpg" width="300" height="226" alt="Southern Farms Lodge" align="right">As 
        for accommodations, you certainly won't be disappointed here. A brand 
        new 2500 square foot lodge can comfortably handle 8 hunters. As you can 
        see from the photo of the dining room and living room, prepare to relax 
        and unwind in a cozy lodge after your hunt. The package price includes 
        a continental breakfast, full lunch and dinner. Our meals included roast 
        beef, chicken, pork chops, spare ribs along with various side dishes. 
        It is difficult to tell lunch from dinner when eating here. With most 
        operations similar to Southern Farms, lunch is simply soup or a sandwich. 
        Let's just say don't plan on losing any weight on your hunting trip !</p>
      <p align="left">As we arrived at the Lodge, both Kirk and I were anxious 
        to begin our hunt. The first night I was located on a grassy field and 
        a food plot that served as a crossing area to some dense pines. Kirk was 
        also located on a food plot. I was in my stand at 3:45 and at 4:15 a nice 
        6 point took a leisurely stroll across the field. As darkness fell later 
        that evening, a larger buck appeared approximately 150 yards away. I could 
        tell the rack was wider, but due to the darkness I was not able to get 
        a close enough look at the rack to determine if it was a &quot;shooter&quot; 
        buck. Southern Farms harvests 8 point or better bucks with a 15 inch spread 
        or larger. For those wishing to take home plenty of venison, you are allowed 
        to harvest 1 doe per day. That evening Kirk saw a young 4 point buck chasing 
        2 doe.</p>
      <p><img src="images/images_articles/southernfrm_lodge3.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="Southern Farms Lodge" align="right">The 
        next morning was pretty uneventful. Kirk didn't see a deer, and I saw 
        a doe cross a food plot a little after 9:00 AM. That evening Kirk saw 
        a 4 point buck, a 6 point buck and 3 doe. As we returned to the lodge 
        that evening we learned that Ryan, an 8 year old trying to bag his first 
        deer missed the 6 point buck that I had seen the previous evening. Troy's 
        policy and attitude toward young, first time hunters who have never taken 
        a buck is very admirable. Fathers who bring their son or daughter to hunt 
        and sit with them in the stand are only charged a fee for 1 hunter. Troy 
        also waives the 8 point, 15 inch minimum requirement for these hunters 
        because he understands that when it comes to bagging a youngsters first 
        buck, every buck is a trophy !</p>
      <p>The following morning was accompanied with heavy rains and quite a light 
        show just before dawn. Luckily, Troy's well built Texas tower stands shielded 
        us from the elements allowing us to stay dry. As dawn broke deer were 
        definitely on the move. That morning I saw 6 doe and a 4 point buck, while 
        Kirk saw 2 doe and a nice 6 point buck. That evening overall deer activity 
        slowed down, but Kirk was still lucky enough to see 5 doe and a rack buck. 
        Due to darkness falling, he wasn't able to count the exact number of points. 
        He was able to determine that the whitetail was not big enough to be a 
        shooter buck. </p>
      <p>The next day came with the same unfavorable weather conditions as was 
        the case the prvious few days. Morning lows were in the mid 60's, with 
        afternoon temperatures soaring into the mid and upper 80's. For those 
        of you who have tried to pursue a trophy whitetail buck, you understand 
        how difficult it is to get one of these guys to appear on a hot, sunny 
        80 degree day. With these conditions against us, little did we realize 
        what is in store for Kirk later that evening. </p>
      <p>The morning hunt was quiet, the only deer sighted was a small 6 point 
        buck by Kirk. After an excellent lunch we tried some new stands in the 
        evening hunt. I wasn't lucky enough to see a deer, but Kirk ended up experiencing 
        one of those &quot;once in a lifetime&quot; evenings. He arrived in his 
        stand a little before 4:00 PM. Within 15 minutes of getting settled, a 
        6 point buck with a very high rack, appeared only 75 yards away. Kirk 
        scoped the buck, trying to somehow squeeze another 2 points out of the 
        rack. Then suddenly, a monster buck appeared about 300 yards away, only 
        showing the top of his neck and head. Kirk was able to count 17 points 
        including a large drop tine on one side and a kicker on the other. At 
        that distance scoring the rack was difficult, but he thinks the buck was 
        easily a 170+ class whitetail. As the buck stood there, it let out a sound 
        Kirk had never experienced in the woods before, much louder and deeper 
        than a grunt. The smaller 6 point buck quickly scurried off. After this, 
        the monster buck retreated into the dense swamp area. A little later the 
        small 6 point buck again appeared, and within seconds the monster buck 
        again came to the same spot, let out the same noise and again the 6 point 
        buck quickly scurried off. The monster buck once again retreated.</p>
      <p>Kirk has spent a lot of hours in the woods watching whitetail bucks and 
        has taken several nice bucks. He was quick to point out that this was 
        the first buck in a long time that made his knees shake. The buck was 
        smart though, he never stepped out to offer a clear shot. Obviously he 
        didn't get to be that big by being careless. As the evening went on, Kirk 
        managed to see 4 more shooter bucks in the swamp area behind him. It was 
        both a rewarding and frustrating experience. He would first see the large 
        bodies of the deer moving through the thick brush and swamp area approximately 
        150 yards from the stand. As soon as he was able to select a spot to scope 
        the animal, it would briefly appear giving him only a glimpse of the large 
        rack.. As soon as he was able to verify that it was a shooter buck, the 
        buck would avoid offering a clean shot. Hard to believe 5 bucks of this 
        class would all be in the same condensed area. As Kirk told his story 
        over dinner, Troy was relieved that we were finally able to get a taste 
        of what Southern Farms whitetail hunting has to offer. Kirk was impressed 
        with not only the racks but also the body size of the bucks he had sighted. 
        All 5 bucks easily weighing in excess of 200 lbs. So much for the notion 
        that all southern, east coast deer are small. The above picture is of 
        a buck taken that same evening. As you can see for yourself, Southern 
        Farms bucks are anything but small. </p>
      <p>The next morning was our last chance. Kirk was eager to return to the 
        same stand in the morning. I wasn't lucky enough to site a deer, but Kirk 
        once again experienced plenty of action. As luck would have it, Mother 
        Nature still was unwilling to give us a break. Not only was the last morning 
        warm, but now a dense fog covered the area Kirk was hunting. A good hour 
        before daylight, Kirk could hear the loud crashing of 2 bucks fighting 
        down in the swamp. This continued for several minutes. Eventually, both 
        the sound and the deer disappeared as dawn approached Later that morning 
        Kirk saw a spike buck and a small 4 point buck. Kirk could only laugh 
        as he considered his last 6 hours in that tree stand. 8 different bucks 
        were sighted, 2 others heard fighting, and not a single shot fired.</p>
      <p align="left"><img src="images/images_articles/southernfrm_deer.jpg" width="300" height="255" alt="Southern Farms Buck" align="right">Troy 
        has a lot of good ideas for the future. In 2002 he plans on running a 
        &quot;Mega Bucks&quot; contest. He plans to have a maximum of 50 hunters. 
        The entry fee will be $1500.00 which includes meals and lodging. Each 
        hunter will be randomly assigned a tree stand each day. First place will 
        pay $10,000 along with numerous other cash prizes. For further details 
        of the upcoming Mega Bucks hunt contact Troy.</p>
      <p>Due to the large Whitetail population in Georgia the season is fairly 
        long. Archery season begins in mid-September and runs to mid-October. 
        This is followed by a 1 week muzzleloader season. Gun season begins in 
        late October and runs through the second week in January. In addition 
        to Trophy Whitetail hunting, Spring gobbler season is also a big attraction 
        for Southern Farms. 2001 turkey hunters enjoyed a 90% success rate. For 
        the avid bird shooter, Southern Farms offers some of the fastest dove 
        and quail shooting to be found anywhere in Georgia. Contact Troy or visit 
        his website for further details.</p>
      <p>Both Kirk and I enjoyed are hunt. Even though neither of us were lucky 
        enough to take a buck, it was obvious to see that Southern Farm holds 
        numerous quality bucks. If you are able to time your hunt right and able 
        to get a few breaks from Mother Nature you will thoroughly enjoy a hunt 
        with Southern Farms.</p>
