<span class="textbd">In the first of a series of interviews with people involved in the wide field of astronomy, AT's Lydia Lousteaux interviews Al Kelly, a highly talented amateur astronomer in the field of CCD Imaging.
</span>
<br><br>
<span class="text">
<p>
<span class="textbd">AK:</span><br>
"I was born in 1946 and grew up on a farm in Indiana, about 80 kilometers north of Indianapolis. The night sky was very dark and I became curious enough about the real universe at the age of ten to ask my father for a telescope. The views through that 40mm refractor were wonderful, but I had to see more, so at the age of twelve, I built a 115mm Newtonian reflector. It too was wonderful.<br>
Since that time I have built or helped build dozens of telescopes, up to 815mm in diametre, and have built a CCD camera, but it has all been in the same pursuit I started at the age of twelve: to see deeper and better into that dark night and to capture part of it. I think this is the primary common pursuit of astronomers, particularly
amateur astronomers, who are involved for the simple love of the subject."
</p>

<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Mr. Kelly, may I ask what your parents thought of you going into the field of ASTRONOMY? Were they maybe a 'Wee bit upset' you didn't become, maybe, a DENTIST? (Mr. Kelly has a "Colgate Smile!)
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AK:</span><br>
"My parents knew nothing about astronomy, but were certainly not put off by my interest in it.  I'm sure, though, that Mom thought I was nuts on those cold winter nights when I would brush away a patch of snow in the middle of the yard, get all bundled up, and hunker down on the ground with my homemade scope in my lap, since at first it had no mount!  I had my first
good look at the rings of Saturn this way and practically froze to the ground staring at them..:-).<br><br>
CCD imaging has now become a mainstay for many of us who are continuing
the pursuits of our youth. It is delightful in its concatenation of the most modern technology with the ancient and simple principles of capturing part of the night sky for closer inspection. Those principles have always been to use a dark, clear, steady sky; to keep your eyes as sensitive as possible; to look carefully and effectively at an area of interest; and 
to record what has been seen as faithfully as possible. For millenia,astronomers used their eyes, their memories, and their stones or papyrus. Over a few short decades, our eyes have become gigantic slabs of delicately hewn glass, our attention has become riveted by intricate guiding mechanisms, and our memories have been etched on fine-grain films and computer hardware. Only the cosmos is essentially unchanged."
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
(Mr. Kelly couldn't have stated his "PHILOSOPHY OF ASTRONOMY" in a more fluid, poetical and romantic style!)<br>
Indiana's winters are so different from South Texas's winters, Mr. Kelly. What took you from CORN to BEEF? 
In other words, what brought you to Texas?
Did you come directly under the employ of NASA?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AK:</span><br>
"My wife, Lori, and I moved to Texas in 1973 when I was hired by NASA as a management intern.  I had just completed a degree in Political Science after
serving in the Army (those were very different times) and was made an offer I couldn't refuse...a job!  I completed a master's degree (MPA) after moving
here and have stuck around, making NASA my career."

<br>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
And how did you become involved with the FINE FOLKS at JSCAS? (<a href="http://www.ghg.net/cbr/jscas/" class="nav2">Johnson Space Center Astronomical Society</a>) Do they ALL work for NASA or Johnson Space Center?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AK:</span><br>
"The JSCAS was started at JSC in the late 60's and I became a member in 1973. We revitalized the group in the late 80's and it remains a very active, vital astronomy club today. It serves the entire community of people interested in astronomy, from NASA employees to anyone else in the JSC/Houston area, or anywhere in the world, for that matter, since we have folks who participate only through our website and JSCAS mailing list. There are no dues. Even though we have very well organized and attended monthly meetings, a fine 
newsletter, and a slate of officers who are re-elected
annually, there are no "Roberts Rules of Order" formalities. We just have traditions..:).  We have no treasurer, but we do keep a bag man &lt;grin&gt;!  
The only costs are for the stamps for mailing out the monthly newsletter to those folks who need to get it through the postal service.
As a member of JSCAS, my interests grew in the early 1980's to the construction and use of large Newtonian reflectors on Dobsonian mounts. I had also been active in film astrophotography since the late 1970's, using
a Celestron 8, and was interested in ways of imaging through the larger telescopes. From about 1983 to 1987 I experimented with video imaging, sometimes using image intensifiers. Finally, sometime in 1988, I had my
first experience with an astronomical CCD imaging system, a Photometrics Star I, and became an instant convert. I was fortunate enough to be able to borrow and use several other CCD cameras over the ensuing years, including the SBIG ST-4 and ST-6 systems."

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Mr. Kelly's details above lead me to believe "Averageman" is able to do the same.  All that is required is the (Betty Crocker or Julia Childs) "Cookbook of Astronomy CCD Imaging"!
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AK:</span><br>
"Making CCD images can be very simple or very complex, depending on the type of imaging (deep-sky, planetary, color composite, 'snapshot', etc.) and the
desired results.  If one simply wants to extend what the eye can see with 15-30 second snapshots of deep-sky objects, the work can be easy and quick,
yet still very rewarding; but, as higher quality results for esthetic and scientific purposes are desired, then the effort required can be much more
demanding.  There is always something new to be learned..:-).<br>
With the publication of the CCD Camera Cookbook 
in 1994, the avenue was open for me to build and own my own CCD camera. Since I am not an electrical engineer or electronics technician, I needed a book which could tell me in simple terms every step necessary to build such a sophisticated device. I completed a CB245 in August of 1994 which I use 
today coupled to either my Celestron 8 (f10/f5.6) or one of my two large Newtonian reflectors. Until recently, the reflectors had been mounted on 
equatorial platforms for tracking purposes (see the December 1991 issue of Sky and Telescope for an article on one of these platforms). At present, 
my Newtonians use altitude-azimuth-focal plane (Alt-Az-FP) drive systems designed by Andy Saulietis, a close friend and also extremely talented member of JSCAS and the Texas/New Mexico amateur astronomy world."

<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
One thing I really liked about Mr. Kelly, besides his sense of humour, friendly smile and exceptional talents in CCD Imaging, he is a very ethical gentleman.  He always gives credit where credit is due.
<br>
Mr. Kelly, I believe I have also seen CCD images of yours in 'Sky and Telescope'. Can you confirm this?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">AK:</span><br>
"Yes.  Over the years I have had many images published in S&T, Astronomy, and the more popular German and Japanese astronomy magazines.  I also authored a chapter on building a Cookbook CCD camera in a book entitled 'Amateur Telescope Making', edited by Stephen Tonkin and published by Springer-Verlag in 1999.  I have given permission many times for my images
to be used in CD-ROM compilations, children's books, and other places. Sometimes I see one of my images and recognize it before I even see the credit &lt;grin&gt;.  
CCD imaging takes you to a lot of interesting places!  I think I was happiest the first time I saw one of my images pop up on the APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day)".

Mr. Kelly, and his lovely wife, Lori, live in the Houston area. They have three talented sons: Keith, Travis, and Logan. Besides Astronomy, his hobbies are computers, and sports (especially golf). He looks FORE-ward to shooting a Hole-In-One, and retiring to the Texas Hill Country.
