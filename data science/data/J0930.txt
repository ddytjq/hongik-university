CJ's Racing has a complete racing facility including fabrication and setup shop.<br>
<br>
Our fabrication capabilities include in-house milling and lathe machinery, hydraulic mandrel tubing bending, 
<img SRC="mig.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="113">
large capacity bead blaster cleaning cabinet, complete welding and cutting systems, 
and most other tooling necessary for building entire race chassis and parts in tight tolerances.<br>
<br>
<img SRC="bender.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="85" HEIGHT="95">
The designated chassis setup area within the facility includes most of the latest technology in chassis setup
and measuring devices.  Electronic scales, turn plates, bump guages, suspension spring checker, and other various
<img SRC="airtank.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="75" HEIGHT="83">
components are used regularly as part of the weekly setup and maintenance procedures.<br>
<br>
<img SRC="weldinghelmut.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="45" HEIGHT="66">
Computer systems are located both within the race shop facility and aboard CJ's Racing's enclosed race trailer.
The computers are used analyze race car behavour, calculate fueling and carburation, gearing considerations, 
as well as other critical information processing.

<img SRC="computer.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="75">
The computers are also used to interface with 
<img SRC="laptop.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="95">
a specifically designed Data Acquisition system for suspension and chassis analysis.  
CJ's Racing is working closely with the Data Acquisition
system's manufacturer to tailor their system specifically for short track asphalt racing.<br>
<br>
<img SRC="scales.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="129">
Engine assembly takes place both at our race shop and at a local machine shop.  Machine shop services include all 
<img SRC="goggles.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="69">
the latest and best machining systems for all engine components.  
Individual engine parts are flowed and balanced 
<img SRC="springchecker.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="104" HEIGHT="268">
within tight tolerances, and powerplant R&amp;D regularly takes place.<br>
<br>
CJ's Racing owns two complete race cars.  One of the racecars is designated specifically for experimental 
research and development, data acquisition, and testing for newly fabricated components. 
CAD (Computer Aided Design) systems are used to improve already existing designs as well as create new ones.<br>
<br>
CJ's motto is &quot;always excel for more!&quot;  Sometimes our ideas do not work, and sometimes they do... 
but without failure, success wouldn't feel so good.
