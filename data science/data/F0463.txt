<span class=subheading>Interview with Gustavo Eydelsteyn, VideoSoft</span>
<span class=text><p>
<p>
We are happy to have Gustavo Eydelsteyn, founder and CEO of VideoSoft, with us today for this interview. Gustavo Eydelsteyn has a Masters degree in Computer Sciences, and has taught various computer classes for the University of California at Berkeley Extension Center.
Gustavo launched VideoSoft in 1991 with the intent to create and distribute high-quality, powerful ActiveX components for Windows application developers. Gustavo is on the board of directors of the Component Vendors' Consortium  (CVC), a nonprofit organization whose purpose it is to advance and promote the use of third-party software components and tools.
</p>
<p><b>VBT: Thanks for being with us today, Gustavo. Tell me a little bit about the latest edition of VSVIEW. What do you see as the most important features of this product release?
</b></p>
<p>We introduced version 1.0 of VSVIEW back in 1994; we're now up to Version 6.0.  We put a lot of work into this new release and I am very pleased with it.  
</p>
<p>VideoSoft VSVIEW 6.0 is best known for it powerful printing engine; it's a replacement for the Visual Basic Printer object. VSVIEW 6.0 makes it easy to create documents and reports for printing and to add print previewing to applications--it only takes a single statement to print plain text or RTF files, and just a few more lines of code to print graphics, tables, and formatted text.
</p>
<p>VSVIEW uses a familiar word processing metaphor to create output: it supports headers, footers, paragraphs, pictures, columns and tables, which makes VSVIEW a very flexible tool to create printed documents.  VSVIEW also supports embedded tables, graphs and metafiles, as well as rich text format (RTF), Java, VBScript and DHTML. And it is ADO compatible so it allows the creation of bound tables that are populated from variant arrays.
</p>
<p>VSVIEW 6.0 was completely rewritten using ATL; performance is now approximately twice as fast as the previous version in most typical tasks. It's also dependency-free so you don't need to distribute the bulky MFC libraries with your applications. 
</p>
<p>VSVIEW also features a WYSIWYG print previewing control; the amount of zoom can be determined by keywords (zm PageWidth, zm WholePage, etc.) or percentages. There's even a Thumbnail view that allows you to see many preview pages at once. Also, at the request of our customers, we've added the ability to mix both landscape and portrait page orientation in the same document. Previewing a document before printing is critically important as it saves time and energy and eliminates the frustration of trial-and-error printing from Visual Basic.
</p>

<p><b>VBT: Who do you see as the primary user for this product? Are there situations where this might not be the best solution?
</b></p>
<p>
Anyone who has ever needed to create printed output in a Visual Basic application will benefit from the flexibility and power of this one control. In addition to the printing engine, VSVIEW 6.0 has two utilities that the developer may pass on to the end users--an ad-hoc report generator and a label generator. Both are ADO compliant, and easy to use.
</p>
<p><b>VBT: What products do you see as competitors to your product?  How does your product compare to these other products?
</b></p>
<p>There is no direct commercial competition for our printer object, VSPrinter; the alternative is to use the 32-bit API for the Visual Basic Printer object and then write a massive amount of code by hand. VSPrinter is one of the only ActiveX components that allows you to create sophisticated, professional documents and reports, then preview and print them from Visual Basic.
</p>
<p>Occasionally the Data Reporter is compared to Seagate's Crystal Reports, but there really is no direct comparison. Crystal Reports is an expansive, robust application designed for a very broad range of complex report generation requirements. The Data Reporter is an easy-to-use, lightweight utility designed to be used at runtime by the end-user who needs to create custom report layouts from a specified database or recordset. In an environment where many people access the same database for dissimilar purposes, this one utility alone is worth the price of the package as it frees the programming staff for more important programming tasks.  
</p>
<p><b>VBT: Tell me about the support options users have for the VSVIEW product. 
</b></p>
<p>We are developers ourselves, so we understand how important it is to ensure our customers receive the support they need to be as productive as possible with our products. Thus we try to make support as fast and convenient as possible. A section of our Web site is devoted to Tech support and programming tips. If the user is unable to find a solution there, he can call us on our toll-free number (US & Canada), or send email. These technical support options are provided at no charge to all registered users of our products.
</p>
<p><b>VBT: Anything else to add about VSVIEW?
</b></p>
<p>Many of our customers have told us VSVIEW appears to be a well-kept industry secret--which we hope to change. Until you are faced with the need to create, preview and print documents from within a Visual Basic application, it's difficult to appreciate what a big timesaver this product can be. This one control can save you thousands of lines of code, and alleviate significant stress as it does the work for you. Many third-party developers have chosen to integrate VSVIEW into their products to add printing capabilities, rather than writing the code required to develop it from scratch.  
</p>
<p>VSVIEW has received several industry awards, the most recent being the 1999 VBPJ Reader's Choice Merit Award for reporting tools.
