Open clusters are physically related groups of stars held together by mutual 
gravitational attraction. Therefore, they populate a limited region of space,
typically much smaller than their distance from us, so that they are all 
roughly at the same distance. They are believed to originate from large cosmic 
gas and dust clouds (<a href="diffuse.html">diffuse nebulae</a>) in the 
Milky Way, and to continue to orbit the galaxy through the disk. 
In many clouds visible as bright diffuse nebulae, star formation takes still 
place at this moment, so that we can observe the formation of new young star
clusters. 
The process of formation takes only a considerably short time compared to the 
lifetime of the cluster, so that all member stars are of similar age. Also,
as all the stars in a cluster formed from the same diffuse nebula, they are 
all of similar initial chemical composition.
<p>
Open clusters are of great interest for astrophysicists because of these 
properties:
<ol>
<li>the stars in a cluster are all at about <i>the same</i> <b>distance</b>
<li>the stars have approximately <i>the same</i> <b>age</b>
<li>the stars have about <i>the same</i> <b>chemical composition</b>
<li>the stars have <i>different</i> <b>masses</b>, ranging from about 80-100 
  solar masses for the most massive stars in very young clusters to less than 
  about 0.08 solar masses.
</ol>
Therefore, they represent samples of stars of constant age and/or constant 
chemical composition, suited for study with respect to stellar structure and 
evolution, and to fix lines or loci in many state diagrams such as the 
color-magnitude diagram (CMD), or Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD). 
Comparing the "standard" HRD, derived from nearby stars with sufficiently 
wellknown distances, or the theory of stellar evolution, with the measured CMD 
of star clusters, provides a considerably good method to determine the distance 
of star clusters. 
Comparing their HRD with stellar theory provides a reasonable way to estimate 
the age of star clusters.
The result that all the cluster HRDs can be explained by the theory of stellar 
evolution gives convincing evidence for this theory, and moreover for the 
underlying physics including nuclear and atomic physics, quantum physics and 
thermodynamics. 
<p>
Over 1100 open clusters are known in our <a href="more/mw.html">Milky Way 
Galaxy</a>, and this is probably only a small percentage of the total 
population which is probably some factor higher; estimates of as many as about 
100,000 Milky Way open clusters have been given. 
<p>
Most open clusters have only a short life as stellar swarms.  As they drift
along their orbits, some of their members escape the cluster, due to velocity
changes in mutual closer encounters, tidal forces in the galactic gravitational 
field, and encounters with field stars and interstellar clouds crossing their 
way.  An average open cluster has spread most of its member stars along its 
path after several 100 million years; only few of them have an age counted by 
billions of years. The escaped individual stars continue to orbit the Galaxy 
on their own as field stars: All field stars in our and the external galaxies 
are thought to have their origin in clusters quite probably.
<p>

The first open clusters have been known since prehistoric times: The
<a href="m/m045.html">Pleiades (M45)</a>, the
<a href="xtra/ngc/hyades.html">Hyades</a> and the
<a href="m/m044.html">Beehive or Praesepe (M44)</a>
are the most prominent examples, but <i>Ptolemy</i> had also mentioned
<a href="m/m007.html">M7</a> and the
<a href="xtra/ngc/mel111.html">Coma Star Cluster (Mel 111)</a>
as early as 138 AD.
First thought to be nebulae, it was <i>Galileo</i> who in 1609 discovered
that they are composed of stars, when observing <a href="m/m044.html">M44</a>.
As open clusters are often bright and easily observable with small
telescopes, many of them have been discovered with the earliest telescopes:
As seen in the <a href="#Messier">list below</a>, there are 27 in Messier's
list, and 32 others were also known in summer 1782. Note that all these early 
known clusters belong to our <a href="more/mw.html">Milky Way Galaxy</a>.
<p>
In 1767, Reverend John Michell (<a href="#michell1767">Michell 1767</a>)
derived that clusters were most probable physically related groups rather
than chance collections of stars, by calculating that it would be extremely 
improbable (1/496,000) to find even one cluster like the Pleiades anywhere in 
the sky, not to speak of the number of then-known open clusters; moreover he 
presumed that all or at least most then-known nebulous objects actually were
composed of stars. 
The finding of common proper motion by M&auml;dler for the Pleiades and other
stellar groups, including the <a href="xtra/ngc/uma-cl.html">Ursa Major 
Moving Cluster</a> by Proctor (<a href="#proctor1869">Proctor 1869</a>), 
further established the physical relationship between cluster stars. 
Finally, spectroscopy was needed to show the common radial motion (velocity)
of the cluster stars, and to show that the stars perfectly match in a 
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD), indicating that they all lie at roughly the 
same distance. The final confirmation of the roughly common distance came only
from the direct measurement of parallaxes for a number of nearby clusters, 
both from Earth-bound observatories and from ESA's astrometric satellite 
Hipparcos.
<p>
Eventually, the theoretical study of stellar evolution has provided convincing 
evidence that the stars of a cluster are all roughly of the same age, and thus 
have formed within a short period of time on the cosmic time scale, i.e. their
HRDs represent isochrones, or pictures of stars of all the same age.
<p>

Open clusters are often typized according to a simple scheme which goes 
back to <a href="xtra/Bios/shapley.html"><b>Harlow Shapley</b></a>, which 
describes richness and concentration roughly:
<dl>
<dt>
  <dl compact>
  <dt><b>c</b>
  <dd>very loose and irregular
  <dt><b>d</b>
  <dd>loose and poor
  <dt><b>e</b>
  <dd>intermediately rich
  <dt><b>f</b>
  <dd>fairly rich
  <dt><b>g</b>
  <dd>considerably rich and concentrated
  </dl>
</dl>

Another important and more sophisticated scheme was introduced by 
<a href="xtra/Bios/trumpler.html"><b>R.J. Trumpler</b></a>
(<a href="#trumpler1930">Trumpler 1930</a>). 
This scheme consists of three parts, characterizing the cluster's degree 
of concentration, the range of brightness of its stars, and the richness, 
as follows:

<dl>
<dt><i>Concentration</i>
<dt>
  <dl compact>
  <dt><b>I  </b>
  <dd>Detached; strong concentration toward center
  <dt><b>II </b>
  <dd>Detached; weak concentration toward center
  <dt><b>III</b>
  <dd>Detached; no concentration toward center
  <dt><b>IV </b>
  <dd>Not well deteached from surrounding star field
  </dl>
<dt><i>Range in Brightness</i>
<dt>
  <dl compact>
  <dt><b>1</b>
  <dd>Small range in brightness<br></td></tr>
  <dt><b>2</b>
  <dd>Moderate range in brightness<br></td></tr>
  <dt><b>3</b>
  <dd>Large range in brightness<br></td></tr>
  </dl>
<dt><i>Richness</i>
<dt>
  <dl compact>
  <dt><b>p</b>
  <dd>Poor: Less than 50 stars<br></td></tr>
  <dt><b>m</b>
  <dd>Moderately rich: 50 to 100 stars<br></td></tr>
  <dt><b>r</b>
  <dd>Rich: More than 100 stars<br></td></tr>
  </dl>
</dl>

A "<b>n</b>" following the Trumpler class indicates that there is nebulosity
associated with the cluster.

All the <a href="diffuse.html">diffuse nebulae</a> in Messier's catalog are

material in (astronomically) very recent times, and are still formed today in
many cases.
