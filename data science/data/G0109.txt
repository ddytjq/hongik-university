<B>Q&A with Harry Ferguson<BR>
Astronomer, Space Telescope Science Institute</B></center><p>
<P>

We asked for your feedback and boy did you deliver! During our first question and answer forum, more than 150 astronomy buffs submitted their questions to astronomer Dr. Harry Ferguson of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STSI). To help answer some of the great questions submitted by "Mysteries of Deep Space" viewers, Dr. Ferguson has enlisted the aid of several of his peers at the STSI, all of whom were  responsible for planning and analyzing the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) observations. In addition to Harry Ferguson, respondents in this forum include:
<ul><li>
<b>Dr. Marc Postman</b>, an associate astronomer at the STSI in Baltimore, MD. His research interests include
observational cosmology, galaxy and cluster formation and evolution,
and measurements of large-scale structure in the universe. Dr. Postman
has used many ground-based telescopes as well as the Hubble Space
Telescope in the course of his research.</li>
<p>
<li><b>Andy Fruchter</b>, an astronomer at the STSI.
He
studies faint galaxies and galaxy clusters as well as compact objects, such as
pulsars. He was one of the architects of the HDF, and
was responsible for the software that was used to improve the resolution
of the final images.</li>
<p>
<li><b>Mauro Giavalisco</b>, an observational cosmologist at the Carnegie
Observatories in Pasadena, California. He pioneered techniques for
identifying very distant galaxies by their colors, and has been
studying such galaxies with Hubble and with the largest ground based
telescopes.</li>
<p>
<li><b>Mark Dickinson</b>, the Davis Postdoctoral at the Johns Hopkins
University. His specialty is studying distant galaxies, identified
around bright radio sources, along the lines of sight to distant
quasars, or in blank fields such as the HDF. He was
one of the first astronomers to use the Keck telescope to obtain
spectra of galaxies detected in the HDF.</li></ul>
<p>
And don't forget <b>Dr. Ferguson</b> himself, who was one of the
  architects of the ground-breaking HDF
  observations, taken with the
  Hubble Space Telescope in December
  1995.

  Dr. Ferguson specializes in the study of
  very faint, distant galaxies. He received his
  undergraduate degree in Astrophysics
  from Harvard University in 1981, his PhD
  from Johns Hopkins in 1990, and worked
  as a postdoctoral fellow at Cambridge
  University before joining the staff at the
  STSI in
  1993.<p>

I just finished watching the PBS special on deep space.  My question
concerns the farthest galaxies we are able to see.  We are seeing them
as they were say 12 billion years ago.  Where are those galaxies now.
They are obviously in a different location now and we won't see the
light from that location till far in the future.<P>


<B>That's exactly right, Tom. We can only see those galaxies as
they were. We can only speculate about what those galaxies look
like now. Presumably, they look like the galaxies that are right
around us (only, say, a billion light years away). But we really
haven't got a good handle on how the distant galaxies evolved
into the ones we see nearby. We have to piece the puzzle together
by studying galaxies at intermediate distances.<P>

By the way, the aliens or whatever on those galaxies we see
in the Hubble Deep Field, see our galaxy as it was 12 billion
years ago. So all we have to do is figure out some way to ask
them what the Milky Way looked like :)<P>

MAYBE THIS HAS BEEN COVERED ,BUT, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THERE IS MORE
STAR STUFF OUT DEEPER IN THE UNIVERSE. THAT THERE LIGHT HAS SIMPLY NOT
REACHED US YET ? IF SO COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT 1 DAY IN THE FUTURE
YOU COULD LOOK UP AND SEE NOTHING BUT STARS WITH NO VOIDS?<P>

WHEN THE BIG BANG TOOK PLACE THE STUFF ON THE OUTSIDE OF THIS SHAPE
WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE, BE TRAVELING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT ? IF
SO HOW COULD WE EVER SEE THE EDGE OF THE UNIVERSE?<P>

<B>
There is probably a lot of stuff out there we haven't seen yet.
However, it's not a matter of light not having time to reach us
from places that are more distant. Because we can see the
microwave background all around us, we know that radiation from
the era before stars and galaxies formed has already reached the
earth. What we are missing is both the very small galaxies and
possibly the individual isolated stars that formed when the universe
was very young. And, for very distant galaxies, we are seeing them
as they were, not as they are. So we are missing the chronology
of evolution, and have to try to piece it together by studying
the properties of galaxies at the whole range of distances from
very nearby to 15 billion light years away. <P>

Because stars have finite lifetimes, it is unlikely that the universe
will ever reach a phase where the whole night sky is filled with
stars.<P>

The universe encompasses all of what exists in the dimensions
that we can sense (space and time). There could be other universes,
or things "outside" our universe that are completely disconnected
from our set of dimensions. I don't know how we would ever find
out, but it is food for thought.<P>

Dr. Ferguson,<P>
After watching the first episode last night, I'm troubled by what I
believe is a simple question.  If we know the known universe started
with the big bang, where's the starting point?  There has to be a
"ground zero" doesn't there?  If we do know where it all started, how
far are we from the center?<P>

Respectfully Submitted,<BR>
Mark Guthrie<P>

<B>
Everything in the universe was part of the big bang. There is no center. <P>

The analogy that only partially works in helping to visualize this
is to take a look at a globe. Imagine you are a two-dimensional
being. You live only on the surface of the globe. You cannot move
in toward the center of the globe, and you cannot leave its surface.
In fact, the only dimensions you can sense at all are along the
surface. So, now, where is the center of your world? Put another
way, where is the center of the SURFACE of the earth?<P>

Now imagine that the globe is actually a balloon and someone starts
to blow it up. All the continents start to move apart. The ones
that are further away from where you are standing move away faster.
Your whole world is expanding. Yet it doesn't have a center in
the two dimensions you are familiar with.<P>

The universe works the same way, but in three dimensions. <P>

                               Best Regards,<BR>

Dr. Ferguson, I have a question re the big bang that has been bothering
me for a long time.  If everything began with a tremendous explosion
with everything accelerating away from everything else at fantastic
speed there, then all the matter of the universe should be gathered in
a thin band like the skin of a bubble. So if we look back towards the
origin of the big bang, there should be a large void until we see the
other side of the bubble where the matter that has been travelling out
from the big bang is located (the other side of the bubble) and if we
use that distance in order to ascertain the age of the universe, should
we not divide that number by 2. Hope I've explained myself clearly
enough for you to understand my delima. Thank you<P>

<B>
The big bang isn't really an explosion. It is a uniform expansion
of space. A better analogy than an explosion is the rubber sheet
that Margaret Geller showed in the first episode of the Mysteries
of Deep space. When she stretched the rubber sheet, all the stars got
further apart. Another analogy is those little dehydrated sponges the
size of a pill that expand to a much larger size when put in water.
Unlike the sponge and the rubber sheet, the universe has no center.
All points in space are equivalent.<P>

Dr Ferguson,<BR>
At the unveiling of the Hubble Deep Field photographs, a couple of the
astronomers were seen extrapolating the results of the Deep Field observations
to the whole sky, coming up with a massive 50 billion observable galaxies from
Earth (assuming an uninterrupted view, of course).<P>

Is that extrapolation a valid one? Assuming the Universe was created from the
Big Bang - the galaxies must all be rushing outwards from a single point, and
as it is highly unlikely that our own galaxy is located in the center, I would
have thought that there should be more observable galaxies if we look back
towards our point of origin, and fewer if we look in the direction we are
moving. Is that the case.<P>

Secondly, do we know how fast the Universe is expanding? If it is only at a
fraction of the speed of light, then surely we should only be able to see as
far as the distance light has travelled since the Universe came into being,
and
that distance would be less than 90% of the way back to the Big Bang as
mentioned on the program. If that is not the case, what is the theoretical
limit to our observations? Could be actually see the Big Bang itself if we had
a big enough telescope?<P>

When astronomers talk about an expanding Universe, I expect most people,
myself included, think of something like expanding ripples on a lake surface and make
assumptions based on that model. I suspect reality is more complex, but I do
not have a good idea as to what it can be!<P>
Regards,<BR>
Mike Walker<P>

<B>
As one of the astronomers shown in that picture, I can't give you
an unbiased answer. I believe the extrapolation is valid insofar as
we knew what fraction of sky we observed, and simply had to multiply
by the ratio of the area of the whole sky to the area of our tiny
pencilbeam. However, a lot of subtleties are glossed over in going
from the number 50 billion, which is the number of galaxies we could
see if we observed to the same depth with Hubble over the whole sky
and portions of our own galaxy weren't in the way (incidentally, it
would take about 600,000 years of observations to do this). To
estimate the total number of galaxies in the universe, we would also
have to guess how many there are that are fainter than ones we
detected, and how many were too distant to see. We can make educated
guesses, but that's about it.<P>

There is no center to the universe, and no identifiable point of origin
of the big bang. The expansion of the universe is uniform, like the
stretching of the rubber sheet shown in the show. Think of yourself
living on the surface of a balloon covered with a bunch of dots
(galaxies) spaced at random. As the balloon inflates, all the dots
move apart. However whatever direction you look, you will see about the
same number of dots.<P>

It's a bit hard to answer your second question, since we are in
a sense "inside" the big bang. There are portions of the universe
that are disconnected from us, in the sense that it would take longer
than the age of the universe for light to reach us from these distances.
However, the real reason we cannot see back to the big bang no matter
how large a telescope we build is that our view is blocked.
Right after the big bang and up through the first 300,000 years or so,
matter in the universe was so hot that it only existed as a soup of
protons, neutrons, electrons, photons (light), and a few other
subatomic particles. Under these conditions, a beam of light (what we
call a photon) could not travel far before hitting one of the
particles. When such a collision occurs the light is scattered in
another direction (or in some cases, actually creates a new particle of
matter). With the universe in such a state, one can only "see" things
which are happening out to a distance equal to the typical path length
between these matter-photon collisions - which at that time was a very,
very small distance. It was not unlike being in a very thick fog.  Thus
when we look back at this fog, we can only see a very small depth
into it.<P>

This fog shows up as very faint microwave and radio radiation
(a fraction of the "snow" on your television set comes from the
cosmic microwave background). This radiation comes from every direction,
because, as I said, we are essentially inside the big bang. The
radiation from different parts in the sky is uniform to one part
in 100,000. However, small non-uniformities have been picked up.
The COBE satellite was the first to detect the ripples on the
microwave background. Satellites are in the works now to map the
signal in detail. The nature of the fluctuations will provide an
extremely good probe of the physics in the early universe. So even
though we can't see the big bang itself, we can learn about what
was going at very early times.<P>

Are there any good models for the distribution of elements within our
own galaxy? Current theories of stellar evolution suggest that all the
elements beyond Hydrogen (and Helium) are "produced" in various types of
stellar explosions. Does this then imply that the suns close to the
center of our own galaxy are "poor" in the heavier elements, since they
are much older than those suns in the spiral arms?<P>

<B>
There are models. It is debatable whether there are any "good" models.
Most of the models make very simple assumptions for how primordial gas
fell into the galaxy as it was forming, how and when stars formed out
of the gas, and what range of masses these stars had. The models also
make assumptions for how the chemical elements get distributed as
different generations of stars form and die. In fact, we have only a
rudimentary understanding of these different physical processes, so the
models are only as good as our guesses.<P>

Interestingly, the stars near the center of our galaxy and other
galaxies are very rich in heavier elements, but you are right they
are in general much older than suns in the spiral arms. The favored
explanation is that the stars in the center formed rapidly, enriching
the gas around them to high levels within about a billion years.
The stars that produce Oxygen, Magnesium, and Silicon live only about
10 million years, so there is time for many generations of them to
pass. Interestingly, these stars don't produce much iron. That comes
later from the explosions of coalescing binary stars (according to
stellar-evolution theory). So this model of the formation of the center
of our galaxy predicts that the Oxygen to Iron ratio in stars there
should be higher than in the sun. This is exactly what is observed.
That doesn't mean the model is right, but it might be on the right
track.  <P>

Is there a better model to understanding the images we
receive from space (billions of light years in the past)?<P>

By the time we get this "light" from distant galaxies,
it is already millions of years old (which would imply
from a "smaller" universe closer to the Big Bang),
but yet these galaxies are already spread across the . . .
universe, as it were.<P>

Why don't we see the beginning?  (Since I don't know the
numbers, you can relay the Math.  I can handle it!<P>

I tried the time vs. 3D concept.  I'm just not getting' it!<P>

<B>
The furthest back we can look is to a time when the universe
was about 300,000 years old. Earlier than that, the universe
was made up of subatomic particles, and light couldn't travel
very far before being scattered off in another direction.<P>

There are all sorts of analogies to the expanding universe
(living on the surface of an inflating balloon is a good
two-dimensional analogy). However, none of them are wonderfully
satisfactory, I agree. <P>

Dear Dr. Ferguson,<BR>

During this fascinating program one of the scientists involved in
the Hubble Deep Field observations described having discovered galaxies
up to 14 billion light years away, the image therefore being of the
universe at its infancy.  How, I wonder, did these particular galaxies
come to be so far from the Milky Way - from the explanation given of the
Big Bang, 14 billion years ago galaxies must have been much closer
together; indeed, only a billion years before they had been part of the
same mass.  It would appear, therefore, that our galaxy and those distant
ones must have been travelling away from each other at practically the
speed of light to be 14 billion light years apart after only 15 billion
years.  Please help me with my confusion about this.<P>

Sincerely,<BR>
Howard Alter<P>

<B>
Yes, the relative motion of our galaxy relative to the
most distant seen in the Hubble Deep Field is nearly the speed
of light.<P>

1. Is a Galaxy a group of planets or early form of solar system?<P>

2. We see movies in theaters about outer space and the types of space
craft is awesome; even though it is just a movie, these are cool ideas
and the question that comes to mind is why can't someone build a much
faster space shuttle so that it wouldn't take years to visit other
planets??<P>

3.  All joking a side, is it possible for someone to buy$$$ a planet?
The Moon for Example?<P>

One of my future goals someday is to become an astronaut and the
mysteries that it holds encourages me to keep this dream alive.  One
draw back however is the speed that the shuttle moves.  Man, if only
there would be a faster shuttle!!<P>

Thanks for your time!  <P>

<B>
1) Galaxies are huge assemblages of stars and planets. Our galaxy
has about 100 billion stars. It probably has even more
planets (our own solar system has nine, and we only have one star).<P>

2) Even if you could build a space shuttle that could travel close
to the speed of light, it would still take quite a long time to
speed up and slow down (otherwise you kill the astronauts),
so a trip to even the nearest star is something that would take generations
-- and lots of $$.<P>

3) Can I interest you in some beachside property around Alpha-Centauri?<P>
                               Best Regards,<BR>

How is the size and distance to various space objects determined?<P>

<B>
There are lots of different ways. None are very precise. The
most direct way is to measure "parallax," that is the change in the
position of a star when the earth is on one side of the sun, compared
to when the earth is on the other side of the sun. This can only be
done for fairly nearby stars.  For distant objects like galaxies,
astronomers try to find "standard candles," such as certain types of
variable stars which are known to have a fairly constant brightness
from studies of our own galaxy. By comparing the brightness of the
stars in the distant galaxy to the brightness of the same type of
stars in our own galaxy, we can get the distance.<P>

Your program said that there are over 50billion estimated galaxies in
space...I was wondering...When you look up into the night sky with the
naked eye, are most of the lights up there stars...or galaxies??  I am
starting to think that a star is never alone...but always included in a
galaxy...I hope I do not sound to un (space) educated....Thanks<P>

Most of the objects you can see with your plain eye are stars
in our own galaxy. If you go to the southern hemisphere and look up
on a dark night, you will see our two nearest neighboring galaxies,
the "Magellanic Clouds." These are actually "dwarf galaxies" orbiting
around the Milky Way. Each contains only a few billion stars.
In the northern hemisphere, you can make out our nearest big neighbor,
the Andromeda galaxy, if you know where to look. It's hopeless to
try this in the city; you need a really dark sky. The Andromeda galaxy
is 2.5 million light years away.<P>

There may be some stars out there that are not included in galaxies.
In fact, we think we have found some with Hubble. However, they were
most likely born in a galaxy and thrown off in an interaction with
another galaxy. The densest concentration of such intergalactic
stars is in the Virgo Cluster, 60 million light years away.<P>

If one would blow up a balloon & then let it go in the
vacuum of space what would happen to the balloon?<P>
Mickey<P>

<B>
Because there is no pressure outside the balloon,
it would suddenly expand, and then, since latex is not
all that strong, it would (soundlessly) pop.<P>

1. Astronomers who use the famous red shift as a means of determining
distance of a stellar object must rely on the quality of the (visual)
spectrum data they receive. There lies the crux of the problem-- how
reliable is the faint light emitted by a galaxy ninety percent to the
edge of the observable universe?<P>

If astronomers get a photon per second (or less), how can a shift be
determined with any degree of accuracy? It's the equivalent of using a
very powerful telephoto lens to photograph a person 20 miles distant.
Sure, you might recognize certain general features, but what about skin
color, etc.?<P>

This may be the best means we have at the moment, but isn't the red
shift measure progressively limited, the closer to the creation point
we focus? Put another way, without any other yardstick, how accurate
can we say the red shift is?<P>

2. What was the cause of the surface aberration found on the Hubble
mirror, and how was a corrective lens designed, given that the
aberration probably could not be measured by any physical means short
of removing the mirror and returning it to earth?<P>

3. Is optical astronomy still the most comprehensive avenue of
information for science, or has it become only a small portion of the
research done today?<P>

<B>
1) The redshift itself can be measured very precisely if you can
get enough photons. The features we use to measure redshifts are
emission and absorption lines of common elements like Hydrogen and
Oxygen. Unless the physics of atoms changes over time, the comparison
of the positions of the spectral lines to their positions in laboratory
measurements on earth yields a redshift. It is not out of the question
that physics on the scale of atoms evolves as the universe evolves.
However, so far, every test we have been able to do indicates that
the universe is well-behaved when it comes to atoms.<P>

You are absolutely right that you need to get lots of photons to measure
a redshift. Even the largest telescopes on earth can only measure
redshifts for the brightest 150 or so of the 3000 galaxies detected
in the Hubble Deep Field. For galaxies fainter than that, we can estimate
an approximate redshift from their color. But that is a very imprecise
estimate. It is fairly useful, though, if you want to divide up the galaxies
we see in the images into those that are closer than half-way
across the universe and those that are further away. These sorts of
imprecise redshift estimates are actually teaching us a lot
about how and when galaxies form.<P>

2) The Hubble mirror was originally polished to the wrong figure
(it had what is known as "spherical aberration," which means all the
rays of light hitting different portions of the mirror did not come to
the same focus.  The cause of this disaster was a washer that was put
in backwards in a piece of test equipment that was used during the
fabrication of the mirror. Precise measurements of the distorted images
of stars taken with the flawed mirror were used to determine
the nature of the aberration and the correction needed.<P>

3) Optical astronomy is only a small portion of research being done
today. It has the widest public appeal, for obvious reasons, but much
of our information about the universe comes from telescopes that
observe in the radio, infrared, or x-ray regions of the spectrum.<P>

Does anyone really know what gravity is or can we just describe its
effects?  Could a understanding of the mechanics of gravity possibly
force a new theory of relativity?<P>

<B>
We can just describe its effects. It is hoped that something along the
lines of string theory will lead to a real understanding of what
gravity is.<P>

What are your current views on the hubble constant and will there ever
be a consensus on it? Also, why are astronomers getting such different
results? Please keep in mind that I'm only an amateur astronomer....no
complicated math theories please!!! Thank you, Rick.<P>

<B>
I suspect that the Hubble constant will come in around
65 km per second per Megaparsec, when all the dust settles.<P>

The dust actually is settling a bit already, I think. Most of the
recent measurements have been between 50 and 80. The reason there is
disagreement is that it is quite tricky to measure the distance to a
distant galaxy. For example, one way to estimate the Hubble constant is
to measure Cepheid variable stars in a distant galaxy.  To be able to
see Cepheids, the galaxy has to be closer than about 100 million light
years. However, even at that great distance, random motions of galaxies
are a fair fraction of their motions due to the overall expansion of
the universe. So you have to use the galaxy with the Cepheids to
calibrate some other distance measurement that will allow you to
estimate the distance to galaxies that are too far away to see
individual stars. For the galaxy that has the Cepheids, you have to
worry that there might be dust in front of them, or that they might be
a little different than Cepheids in our own galaxy. These are just a
few of the issues. The reason there is such heated disagreement is that
astronomers don't even agree on which issues are important and which
aren't.<P>

The big bang theory does not account for 'spin'.
Only an outward release from centrifugal forces
will allow such motion and orbit on a narrow path.
If the matter to make planets is manufacture in
suns, this centrifugal force is developed as the
ever complexing molecules rise and fall to be compressed
until finally spewed forth as molten liquid.Only a
'black hole'could compress the energy represented by
temperature into the stuff of galaxies. Quasars and
empty black holes would be failed, or forming galaxies.
Saying that the universe is any number of billions of
years old is false, it has no age we could calculate.<P>

<B>
You are right that the big bang theory does not account for spin. The
spin of astronomical objects like galaxies and solar systems probably
came about as the result of tidal interactions between gas clouds that
existed as these entities were forming.<P>

Most of the available evidence supports a finite age to the universe.
The concept of age does get a bit tricky in curved space time, but
if the big-bang theory is right, the age is calculable once you define
what it is you want to call the age.<P>
