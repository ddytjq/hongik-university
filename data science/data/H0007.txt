<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>"The main conclusion here arrived at... is that man is descended from some less highly organized form. The grounds upon which this conclusion rests will never be shaken, for the close similarity between man and the lower animals in embryonic development, as well as in innumerable points of structure and constitution, both of high and of the most trifling importance,- the rudiments which he retains, and the abnormal reversions to which he is occasionally liable,- are facts which cannot be disputed." <B>Darwin</B> </P>
<P>"But nature -that is, biological evolution - has not fitted man to any specific environment. On the contrary, ... he has a rather crude survival kit; and yet -this is the paradox of the human condition - one that fits him to all environments. Among the multitude of animals which scamper, fly, burrow and swim around us, man is the only one who is not locked into his environment. His imagination, his reason, his emotional subtlety and toughness, make it possible for him not to accept the environment but to change it." <B>Jacob Bronowski</B> </P>
<P>"The replicators which survived were the ones that built <I>survival machines</I> for themselves to live in... Now they swarm in huge colonies, safe inside gigantic lumbering robots... They are in you and me; they created us, body and mind; and their preservation is the ultimate rationale for our existence. They have come a long way those replicators. Now they go by the name of genes, and we are their survival machines." <B>Richard Dawkins</B> </P>
<P>"What distinguishes our species is thought. The cerebral cortex is a liberation. We need no longer be trapped in the genetically inherited behavior patterns of lizards and baboons." <B>Carl Sagan</B> </P>
<P>"But as much as we would like to take a unified view of nature, we keep encountering a stubborn duality in the role of intelligent life in the universe, as both subject and student. We see this even at the deepest level of modern physics."<B> Steven Weinberg</P>
</B></FONT><P><A HREF="#HOME"><IMG SRC="WB01339_.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40></A><A NAME="Place"><A HREF="A11place.htm"><B>1.1 Our Place in the Universe</B></A></A></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>"Whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed laws of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful, have been and are being, evolved." <B>Darwin</P>
</B><P>"The large-scale homogeneity of the universe makes it very difficult to believe that the structure of the universe is determined by anything so peripheral as some complicated molecular structure on a minor planet orbiting a very average star in the outer suburbs of a fairly typical galaxy." <B>Steven Hawking</B> </P>
<P>"If all else fails, we may be thrown back on an anthropic explanation. There may in some sense or other be many different universes, each with its own value for the cosmological constant. If this were true, then the only universe in which we could expect to find ourselves is one in which the total cosmological constant is small enough to allow life to arise and evolve." <B>Steven Weinberg</P>
</B><P>"The argument of this book is that we, and all other animals, are machines created by our genes. Like successful Chicago gangsters, our genes have survived, in some cases for millions of years, in a highly competitive world. This entitles us to expect certain qualities of our genes. I shall argue that the predominate quality to be expected in a successful gene is ruthless selfishness." <B>Richard Dawkins</P>
</B><P>"Insofar as it makes for the survival of one's descendents and near relations, altruistic behavior is a kind of Darwinian fitness, and may be expected to spread as a result of natural selection." <B>J. B. S. Haldane</P>
</B><P>"What is the direct evidence for genetic control of specific human social behavior? At the moment the answer is none whatever... Sociobiologist must therefore advance indirect arguments based on plausibility." <B>Steven Gould</P>
</B><P>"It is nature's intention also to erect a physical difference between the body of the freeman and that of the slave, giving the latter strength for the menial duties of life, but making the former upright in carriage and useful for the various purposes of civic life... It is thus clear that just as some are by nature free, so others are by nature slaves, and for these latter the condition of slavery is both beneficial and just." <B>Aristotle</B>. </P>
<P>"A devil, born a devil, on whose <I>nature Nurture</I> can never stick; on whom my pains, Humanely taken, are all lost, quite lost." <B>Shakespeare</B> </P>
<P>"Nature hath made men so equal in the faculties of the body and mind; as that though there be found one man sometimes manifestly stronger in body, or of quicker mind than another. Yet when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man, is not so considerable, as that one man can thereupon claim to himself any benefit, to which another may not pretend, as well as he." <B>Thomas Hobbes</P>
</B><P>"This Rousseauist tradition has a remarkably strong grip on the post-occidental imagination. It is feared that without it we shall be prey to reactionary persuasion by assorted villains, from social-Darwinists to eugenicists, fascists and new-right conservatives. To fend of this villainy, the argument goes, we must assert that man is either innately neutral (<I>tabula rasa</I>) or innately good and that bad circumstances are what make him behave wickedly." <B>Robin Fox</B> </P>
<P>"In time, much knowledge concerning the genetic foundation of social behavior will accumulate, and techniques man become available for altering gene complexes by molecular engineering and rapid selection through cloning. At the very least, slow evolutionary change will be feasible through conventional eugenics." <B>E O Wilson</B> </P>
</FONT><P><A HREF="#HOME"><IMG SRC="WB01339_.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40></A><A NAME="Genes"><A HREF="A12gene.htm"><B>1.2 Genes and Behavior</B></A></A></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>"The initial configuration of the universe may have been chosen by God, or it may have been determined by the laws of science. In either case, it would seem that everything in the universe would then be determined by evolution according to the laws of science, so it is difficult to see how we can be masters of our fate." <B>Steven Hawking</P>
</B><P>"These facts are in accord with the hypothesis that human social behavior rests on a genetic foundation... The same facts are unfavorable for the competing hypothesis, which has dominated the social sciences for generations, that mankind has escaped its own genes to the extent of being entirely culture bound." <B>E O Wilson</P>
</B><P>"It is quite entertaining to watch a computer simulation which starts with a strong majority of suckers, a minority of grudgers which is just above the critical frequency, and about the same sized minority of cheats. The first thing that happens is a crash in the population of suckers as the cheats ruthlessly exploit them. The cheats enjoy a soaring population explosion, reaching their peak as the last sucker perishes. But the cheats still have the grudgers to reckon with..." <B>Richard Dawkins</P>
</B><P>"Complex organisms are not the sum of their genes, nor do genes alone build particular items of anatomy or behavior by themselves. Most genes influence several aspects of anatomy and behavior - as they operate through complex interactions with other genes and their products, and with environmental factors both within and outside the developing organism. We fall into deep error, not just harmless oversimplification, when we speak of genes "for" particular parts or behaviors." <B>Steven Gould</B> </P>
<P>"A society based simply on the gene's law of universal ruthless selfishness would be a very nasty society in which to live. But unfortunately, however much we deplore something, it does not stop it being true." <B>Richard Dawkins</P>
</B><P>"The practice of war is a straightforward example of a hypertrophied biological predisposition." <B>E O Wilson</P>
</B><P>"Minuscule samples, uncontrolled experiments, exquisite analysis of heterogeneous data, and unsupported speculations in place of measurements are all common features of biological determinist literature. Paper after paper&nbsp;published in the leading journals of human and behavioral genetics... commit the most elementary errors... which would never be tolerated in, say, the Agronomy Journal or Animal Science. To write about human beings gives one a license not extended to the study of corn!" <B>Rose, Kamin and Lewontin</B></FONT> </P>
<P><A HREF="#HOME"><IMG SRC="WB01339_.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40></A><A NAME="Goedesic"><A HREF="A13geo.htm"><B>1.3 The Human Geodesic</B></A></A></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>"An intelligence knowing at a given instance of time, all forces acting in nature, as well as the momentary positions of all things of which the universe consists, would be able to comprehend the motions of the largest bodies of the world and those of the of the smallest atoms in one single formula... To it, nothing would be uncertain, both future and past would be present before its eyes." <B>Simon De Laplace</B> </P>
<P>"The problems of determinism have been discussed over the centuries. The discussion was somewhat academic, however, as we were far from a complete knowledge of the laws of science, and we didn't know how the initial state of the universe was determined. The problems are more urgent now because there is the possibility that we may find a complete unified theory in as little as twenty years. And we realize that the initial state may itself have been determined by the laws of science." <B>Steven Hawking</P>
</B><P>"But radical contingency is a fractal principle, prevailing at all scales with great force. At any of the hundred thousand steps in the particular sequence that that actually led to modern humans, a tiny and perfectly plausible variation would have produced a different outcome, making history cascade down a pathway that could never have led to Homo sapiens, or to any self-conscious creature." <B>Steven Gould</P>
</B><P>"Here then is Darwin's dangerous idea: the algorithmic level is the level which best accounts for the speed of the antelope, the wing of the eagle ... and all the other occasions for wonder in the world of nature. It is had to believe that something as mindless and mechanical as an algorithm could produce such wonderful things. No matter how impressive the products of an algorithm, the underlying process always consists of nothing but a set of individually mindless steps succeeding each other without the help of any intelligent supervision..." <B>Daniel Dennett</B> </P>
<P>"Best are all things as the will Of God ordained them, his creating hand Nothing imperfect or deficient left Of all that he created, much less man. Or ought that might his happy state secure, Secure from outward force; within himself The danger lies, yet lies within his power: Against his will he can receive no harm. But God left free the will, for what obeys Reason, is free." <B>Milton <P/></P>
</B><P>"Central to our feelings of awareness is the sensation of the progression of time. We <I>seem</I> to be moving every forward, from a definite past to an uncertain future… More often, we feel ourselves to be helpless spectators - perhaps thankfully relieved of responsibility, - as, inexorably, the scope of a determined past edges its way into an uncertain future. Yet physics, as we know it tells a different story. All the successful equations of physics are symmetrical in time. They can be used equally well in one direction of time as in another." <B>Roger Penrose</B> </P>
<P>"You have written this huge book on the system of the world without once mentioning the author of the universe." <B>Napoleon</B> </P>
<P>"Sire, I had no need of that hypothesis." <B>Simon De Laplace</P>
</B></FONT><P><A HREF="#HOME"><IMG SRC="WB01339_.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=40></A><A NAME="Facts"><A HREF="A14facts.htm"><B>1.4 Facts, Theories, and Options</B></A></A></P>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>"The insights of the philosophers I studied seemed murky and inconsequential compared to the dazzling successes of physics and mathematics. From time to time since then I have tried to read current work on the philosophy of science. Some of it I found to be written in a jargon so impenetrable that I can only think that it aimed at impressing those who confound obscurity with profundity." <B>Steven Weinberg</B> </P>
<P>"Maybe I'm being a bit harsh on philosophers, but they have not been very kind to me... I have been variously called nominalist, an instrumentalist, a positivist, a realist, and several other ists. The technique seems refutation by denigration: If you can attach a label to my approach, you don't have to say what is wrong with it... I am sure that Einstein, Heisenberg and Dirac didn't worry about whether they were realists or instrumentalists." <B>Steven Hawking</P>
</B><P>"Most of the propositions and questions to be found in philosophical works are not false but nonsensical. Consequently we cannot give any answer to questions of this kind, but can only point out that they are nonsensical." <B>Wittgenstein</P>
</B><P>"All other inquiries of men regard only matter of fact and existence, and these are evidently incapable of demonstration. Whatever <I>is</I> may <I>not be</I>. No negation of a fact can involve a contradiction. The non-existence of any being, without exception, is as clear and distinct an idea as its existence. The proposition which affirms it not to be, however false, is no less conceivable and intelligible than that which affirms it to be." <B>David Hume</P>
</B><P>"This throws some light on the question of why logical propositions cannot be confirmed by experience any more than they can be refuted by it. Not only must a proposition of logic be irrefutable by any possible experience, but it must also be nonconfirmable by any possible experience." <B>Wittgenstein</P>
</B><P>"Geometry however, is not concerned with the relationship of ideas involved in it to objects of experience, but only with the logical connection of these ideas among themselves." <B>Einstein</P>
</B><P>"The fact that all Mathematics is Symbolic Logic is one of the greatest discoveries of our age; and when this fact has been established, the remainder of the principles of mathematics consists in the analysis of Symbolic Logic itself." <B>Bertrand Russell</B> </P>
<P>"What constitutes a propositional sign is that in it its elements (the words) stand in a determinate relation to one another. A propositional sign is a fact." <B>Wittgenstein</B></FONT> </P>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>"The accompanying papers... related to the same subject, viz. the Laws which affect the Production of Varieties, Races, and Species, contain the results of the investigations of two indefatigable naturalists, Mr. Charles Darwin and Mr. Alfred Wallace. The gentlemen having, independently and unknown to one another, conceived the same very ingenious theory to account for the appearance and perpetuation of varieties and of specific forms on our planet. ...

<P>"Is mathematics invention or discovery? When mathematicians come upon their results are they just producing elaborate mental constructions that have no actual reality... or are mathematicians really uncovering truths which are, in fact, already 'there' - truths whose existence is quite independent of the mathematician's activities?

<P>"It might at first be thought that the proposition 7 + 5 = 12 is a mere analytical judgment... according to the law of contradiction... But on closer examination... the concept of twelve is by no means thought merely by thinking of the combination of seven and five." <B>Kant</P>

Is human reason, then, without experience, merely by taking thought, able to fathom the properties of real things?" <B>Einstein</P>
</B><P>"The point of mathematics is that in it we have always got rid of the particular instance, and even of any particular sorts of entities. So that for example, no mathematical truths apply merely to fish, or merely to stones, or merely to colors. So long as you are dealing with pure mathematics, you are in the realm of complete and absolute abstraction. ...

Godel's theorem defines a deed, it seems, that a genuine human mind can perform but that no impostor, no mere algorithm controlled robot, could perform.

The controversy all lies in how to harness the theory to prove anything about the nature of mind." <B>Daniel Dennett</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>"Most of what is unusual about man can be summed up in one word: 'culture'. I use the word not in a snobbish sense, but as a scientist uses it. Cultural transmission is analogous to genetic transmission in that, although basically conservative, it can give rise to a form of evolution." <B>Richard Dawkins</P>
</B><P>"The same conclusion may be extended to man; the intellect must have been all-important to him, even at a very remote period, as enabling him to invent and use language, to make weapons, tools, traps, etc. whereby with the aid of his social habits, he long ago became the most dominant of all living creatures." <B>Darwin</P>
</B><P>"And that series of inventions, by which man from age to age has remade his environment, is a different kind of evolution - not biological but cultural evolution." <B>Jacob Bronowski</P>
</B><P>"The theory of population genetics and experiments on other organisms can show that substantial changes can occur in less than 100 generations, which for man reaches back only to the time of the Roman Empire... The question of interest, then, is the extent to which the hereditary qualities of the hunter-gatherer existence have influenced the course of subsequent cultural evolution." <B>E O Wilson</P>
</B><P>"The brain does much more than recollect. It compares, synthesizes, analyzes, generates abstractions. We must figure out much more than our genes can know. That is why the brain library is some ten thousand times larger than the gene library. Our passion for learning, evident in the behavior of every toddler, is the tool for our survival." <B>Carl Sagan</P>
</B><P>"A great stride in the development of the intellect will have followed, as soon as the half-art and half-instinct of language came into use; for the continued use of language will have reacted on the brain and produced an inherited effect; and this again will have reacted on the improvement of language... The largeness of the brain in man relatively to his body, compared with the lower animals, may be attributed in chief part to the early use of some simple form of language,- that wonderful engine which affixes signs to all sorts of objects and qualities, and excites trains of thought which would never arise from the mere impression of the senses, or if they did arise could not be followed out." <B>Darwin</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>"The development of the moral qualities is a more interesting problem. The foundation lies in the social instincts, including under this term the family ties.

</B><P>"When we study the sage grouse or elephant seals in their natural habitat we can be fairly sure that they are striving to maximize their long-term reproductive success. But it is much more difficult to make the same claim for human beings. People strive for something, certainly, but it is usually money, power security of happiness. The fact that they do not translate these into babies is raised as evidence against the whole evolutionary approach to human affairs." <B>Matt Ridley</B> </P>
<P>"I believe that the human mind is constructed in a way that locks it inside this fundamental constraint and forces it to make choices with a purely biological instrument. If the brain evolved by natural selection, even the capacities to select particular esthetic judgments and religious beliefs must have arisen by the same mechanistic process." <B>E O Wilson</B> </P>
<P>"For moral philosophy is nothing else but the science of what is <I>good</I>, and <I>evil</I>, in the conversation, and society of mankind. <I>Good</I>, and <I>evil</I>, are names that signify our appetites and aversions; which in different tempers, customs, and doctrines of men are different." <B>Hobbes</P>

Indeed, the fear of disapproval and the need for approval seem to be the most powerful and almost exclusive motivation for ethical judgment." <B>Erich Fromm</P>
</B><P>"The high standard of our intellectual powers and moral disposition is the greatest difficulty which presents itself, after we have been driven to this conclusion on the origin of man. But every one who admits the principle of evolution, must see that the mental powers of the higher animals, which are the same in kind with those of man, though so different in degree, are capable of advancement." <B>Darwin</P>

His trivial behavior may be decided by reason, but his important decisions have already been made: what kind of person he will marry, how many children he will have, what kind of bed he will die in... It is incredible to think, at first, that man's fate, all his nobility and all his degradation, is decided by a child no more than six years old, and usually three...
