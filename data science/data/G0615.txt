It's a little trickier.

have to take my word that most of this is true, because it involves some
math that I'd rather not show here (for fear of scaring people
away---myself included!).  This is just a spacetime diagram of Lupin
coming up behind me, flying over my shoulder, and flyin away in front of
me.  That green parabola is a line of constant distance.  See Lupin's line
of simultaneity?  See mine?  X and Y trace out the same proper distance,
for that's where our lines of simultaneity cross the parabola.
<p>
If someone else were moving faster than Lupin, their line of simultaneity
would cross the parabola above Y and would trace out an even longer
distance.  This has to do with something called length contraction.
Length contraction is a lot like time dialation.  The faster someone
moves, the shorter they seem to an inertial observer.  Likewise, the
faster someone moves, the shorter the inertial observer seems to them.  A
line (parabola, really) of constant time is the same green line rotated
90&#176 counter-clockwise.

Aha, now I can show you what a spacetime diagram of an accelerated
object---in this case a spaceship.  Again, those green parabolas are lines
of constant distance.  One is the front of the rocket, and one is the back
end.  You'll notice that the parabolas have different, well...curvature,
for lack of a better word.  The parabola at the front is less curved than
the one at the back.  What does this mean?  This means that the front of
the rocket experiences less acceleration than the back.  The closer the
parabola gets to looking like the light rays, the more acceleration that
object experiences.  Material things cannot have a parabola that exactly
follows the light ray---that would mean they have infinite acceleration
and are going at the speed of light (which matter just can't do).
<p>
<a name="simultaneity"><h1>What about simultaneity?</h1>
Before you saw that two different observers had
different lines of simultaneity.  Does that mean that the front of the
rocket would describe different events as simultaneous than the back?
Nopers!  See that top blue line?  That's the line of simultaneity for both
front and back!  What's the catch?  There's gotta be a catch.  While both
ends agree about what events are simultaneous, they do not agree about the
time said events happened.  Someone at the back end would think the person
at the front end has a fast watch, and someone at the front would complain
the person at the back has a slow watch.  Granted, these effects are
miniscule in most situations.  The disparity between the two watches is
only significant when the difference in acceleration is large.  Spaceships
are certainly not large enough for that!
