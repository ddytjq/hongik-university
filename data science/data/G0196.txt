					<P>A galaxy is an ecosystem. Interstellar gas is condensed to
					form stars. As they evolve, star loose mass and energy in form of
					stellar winds and radiation. As a massive star dies in a
					supernova explosion, it heats the surrounding gas to millions of
					degrees. This gas can then circulate between the disk and halo of
					a galaxy. Finally, when the gas cools down, it may be
					condensed again to form new stars. There is a great deal of
					uncertainties in this picture of the galaxy ecosystem, however.
					The study of the amount and extent of hot gas in a galaxy is
					critically important for us to understand how the whole system works.
					Therefore, the discovery of the hot gas halo around NGC 4631 may
					lead to a better understanding of the structure and evolution of
					galaxies.

					<P>Supernova explosions are believed to be the major heating
					mechanism of hot gas in a galaxy. The supernova blastwave can
					naturally heat the interstellar gas to a temperature of a few
					million degrees. The hot gas with its high pressure and low
					density tends to flow out from the galactic disk, just as an
					atomic bomb explosion produces a mushroom cloud flowing into the
					upper atmosphere of the Earth. The comparison of the Chandra and
					Hubble images clearly shows that the hot gas indeed originates
					in recent massive star forming regions, where the supernova
					explosions are most frequent.</P>

					<P>We don't know yet. NGC 4631 is the very first galaxy that
					convincingly shows the presence of a diffuse hot gas halo. This
					galaxy is located in a direction far away from the Galactic
					plane of the Milky Way so that soft X-ray absorption by cold
					interstellar gas in our Galaxy is minimal. Also, NGC 4631 is
					quite active in star formation, which is presumably required to
					produce enough hot gas to be observable. Galaxies that are not
					edge-on are also not ideal for detecting halo gas because of
					confusion with X-ray emission from galactic disks. Most
					importantly, the Chandra X-ray Observatory provides us for the
					first time the high spatial resolution capability to separate discrete
					sources from the diffuse hot gas contribution. Chandra is going
					to observe other nearby edge-on disk galaxies. So in the near
					future we will know what kind of galaxies have hot gas halos.</P>

					<P>This is a million dollar question. The notion that there
					might be a hot extended corona around our Milky Way was
					postulated more than four decades ago. Spitzer (1956) proposed
					the presence of the corona as a way to confine cold gas clouds
					observed away from the Galactic disk. Since then, various
					observations have been conducted in various wavelengths to probe
					the hot gas. While there are indications for the presence of the
					hot corona (the soft X-ray background and ultraviolet
					emission/absorption lines), the interpretation of the
					observations has been controversial. There are two major
					difficulties in the study of hot gas in our own Galaxy: first,
					we are in the mist of the hot gas. Second, we cannot see far
					from the solar neighborhood because of the X-ray absorption by
					cool gas in the Milky Way. These facts make it difficult for us
					to appreciate the overall extent and shape of hot gas, let alone
					its interaction with other components (massive stars and cool
					interstellar gas) of the Galaxy. Therefore, an outsider's view
					of a nearby disk galaxy such as NGC 4631 helps us greatly in
					interpreting observations of our own Milky Way.</P>

					<P>Both the Milky Way and NGC 4631 are disk galaxies and are
					active in star formation. Unlike so-called starburst galaxies
					with star formation concentrated in their nuclear regions, both
					the Milky Way and NGC 4631 show active star formation over much
					of the galactic disks. But NGC 4631 appears to be smaller (and
					lighter) and is interacting more vigorously with neighboring
					galaxies than our own Galaxy. How these differences may affect
					the amount and overall morphology of the hot gas halo is yet to be
					determined. This is why we still need observations of galaxies
					with various properties.</P>
