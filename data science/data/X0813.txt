<p>At first they would only participate in Perlis Open, Pahang Cycling Challenge
and maybe in the Tour of Malaysia. One week before it started we also received
an invitation to take part in Selangor Open. Luckily some riders could change
their flight schedule and Village Peddler was with 4 riders in Selangor Open.</p>

<br>
<tt>Dear cycling fans</tt><br>
<tt>The first stage of the 2 day Selangar Open began on the morning of the 7th</tt><br>
<tt>of October here in Shah Alam with an 11.5km individual time trial. The four</tt><br>
<tt>members representing the ‘Village Peddler’ World Wide Cycling team (Peep</tt><br>
<tt>Mikili (Estonia), Rafael Chyla (Germany), Tim Vincent and I, Nathan Dahlberg</tt>
<tt>(both of New Zealand) were all in various states of fatigue after long</tt>
<tt>flights from New Zealand and Europe, however we are recuperating well with</tt>
<tt>the normal Asian hospitality.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>The Selangar Open is a relatively small warm-up event for the upcoming 4 day</tt><br>
<tt>‘Perlis Open’ in Northern Malaysia followed by the 9 day ‘Tour of
Pahang’</tt><br>
<tt>later this month so it was a great event to use to begin to attempt to</tt><br>
<tt>adjust to the mid 30 degree temperatures and high humidity.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>The Open consists of 3 stages, an 11.5 km time trial and a 40 km Circuit</tt><br>
<tt>Points Race both on the 7th. On the 8th of October is a 130 km Road Race.</tt><br>
<tt>The courses consist of small rolling hills and are contested by six</tt><br>
<tt>international and nine local teams, each of 6 riders, (except the time trial</tt>
<tt>where only three riders from each team rode). The overall classment is for</tt>
<tt>teams only, quite different from normal procedure which recognises</tt><br>
<tt>individuals.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>In the time trail, Peep Mikli finished 10th (at +1:13), Rafael Chyla 6th (at +1:03) and</tt>
<tt>Nathan 7th (at + 1:13) to the strong Russian rider Irator Damir of the</tt>
<tt>Uzbekistan National Team. All three felt that they started well but then</tt>
<tt>began to struggle at the halfway mark. Luckily, of the three stages, the</tt>
<tt>time trial is the least important.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>In the mid afternoon heat, the 40 km circuit points race proved much more</tt><br>
<tt>exhausting than expected. The locals set a hot pace from the start but it</tt><br>
<tt>was to prove a sprinters day. The whole team got behind Rafael, our best</tt><br>
<tt>sprinter, and with Tim and Nathan keeping the group together and Peep</tt><br>
<tt>leading out, Rafael was&nbsp; able to show his talent by winning all three</tt><br>
<tt>sprints to take the overall win. Peep also placed 4th overall behind two</tt><br>
<tt>Indonesian riders. Interestingly the time trial&nbsp;&nbsp; specialist and
winner of</tt><br>
<tt>stage one, Irator Damir didn’t start the second stage, another rider
filled</tt><br>
<tt>his spot but it didn’t help as the Uzbeks were unable to feature.</tt><br>
<br>
<tt>Tomorrow we have the 130 km circuit race on the circuit used for the</tt><br>
<tt>Commonwealth Games in 1998.</tt><br>

<br>
Hot, hot, hot again. The race distance was shortened to just 105 km, but even
this felt long in the incredible afternoon heat on the rolling course.<br>
<br>
The plan was to win the team classment, this being the most important part of
the race. Once again, Tim and I cotrolled the race for our two sprinters
Peep and Rafael, however one of the workers would also have to sprint, as the
team classment was based on the third rider.<br>
<br>
The Indonesians were very active on the small climbs, and the Uzbecks also
launched attacks but in the end it was a very strong Robert Tan from Malaysia
who soloed the last 8km to victory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peep and Rafael scored a one two in the bunch sprint and with
Me in 7th
the team classment was won. A good days work.<br>

<p><b>Oktober 12</b></p>
<p>Yesterday the Perlis Open started with a mountainbike race. Tim Vincent who
is one of the best New Zealand mountainbikers brought his mountainbike as well.
He won this race and made a perfect start of the Perlis Open for the Village
Peddler International Team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The road events of the Perlis Open started today with a 50 kilometer time
trial. It was won by an Indonesian rider, 2nd was a Malysian and 3rd an Uzbek.
Nathan got 5th, and Peep 6th.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Oktober 13</b></p>
<p><font size="3">Peep Mikli won the road race in closed foto

</font></p>
<p><b>Oktober 14</b></p>
<p>The final stage of Perlis Open was a 46 kilometer points criterium. We did
one before in Selangor Open so we knew we had a good chance with our fast
sprinters Peep Mikli and Rafael Chyla.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The criterium was very fast, over 45 kilometer average and nobody got away.
This time Peep could gain the most points and won the race, Rafael got second.</p>

<br>
Another first for Village Peddler&nbsp; Worldwide Cycling when Tim Vincent won
the opening Mountain Bike Race. Already the hero of the local girls after
catching one of them when she fainted at the opening ceremony, Tim set about
demolishing the field in the 20 km race.<br>
The 56 starters had to contend with torrential tropical rain, jungle and
mosquitoes as they raced over four laps of the rolling course. Tim extended his
30 second lead after the first lap to win by one and a half minutes, and in the
process became the hero of the local mountain bike boys as well.<br>

The following mornings 50km Individual Time Trial was won by Tonton Susanto of
Indonesia, widley acclaimed as the best rider in SE Asia. He took almost a
minute out of Malaysian Sahahrulneeza and 2:30 out of Nathan Dahlberg in 5th
place, while averaging almost 48km/hr in hot and windy conditions.<br>
<br>
Day 3 was perhaps the main event, the 150km road race. After 15 mins of piano,
the race turned fast and furious, fortunately the overcast conditions were more
cooling than previous days.<br>
With constant atacking, particularly on the part of the Indonesians, 15 riders
eventually escaped, including Tim and Nathan. Later Peep bridged up with 4
others after a long hard chase. The last stages of the race along the sea front
saw a group of seven riders slip away in the cross-winds with Nathan leading
Peep out for the final sprint. Peep had already been 8 times second in races
this year without a victory and the sprint was so close he really didn't know if
he had his seasons first victory or his 9th second place. The judges didn't know
either, it took 30 minutes of studying the photo finish before finally awarding
Peep the victory. Second place went to Indonesian Wanwan Setibudi.<br>
<br>
Peep had only just time to celebrate his victory before he got his second in the
Criterium the very next day, ahead of Rafael in second place. Right from the
start the pace was on, and the 47 km were covered in 1 hr and 2 mins. With
Nathan and new team member Craig Thomson leading out and covering breaks, the
two sprinters only had to do what they do best.<br>
<br>
Next day was a 13 hr bus trip from hell to Kauntan Pahang where the 10 day tour
of Pahang will start on the 16th.<br>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The tour of Pahang is a very tough 10 day race through Malaysia's biggest
state, with long stages, thru steaming tropical jungles, and beside beautiful
beaches.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The Village Peddler International Team arrived well in Pahang for the Cycling
challenge, a ten day stage race. There were some problems because the Team
arranged an extra cyclist, a Team manager and&nbsp; a Mechanic, all three were
Malysian. The commisaires didn't give their permission. Because it is an
International Team they don't accept Malaysian riders or personel. At the last
moment they found another Manager and an extra rider. Ulzii-Orshikh, a mongolian
cyclist completes the team as 6th rider. He is an excellent rider with many good
results. He is the current Mongolian Champion and was 2nd on the Asian Games
this year.</p>
<p>Report received on Oktober 24:
</p>
<p>The tour includes 2 timetrials , one individual opening TT of 15km, followed
by a 62km team time trial on the 4th day. However the real decider won't be the
long stages or the heat and timetrials, but the 30km (2000m altitude gain) climb
up to Genting Highlands, surely one of the hardest climbs in the world!!<br>
A truly international team lines up for VP worldwide cycling, including<br>
Ulzii Orshikh out of Mongolia<br>
Peep Mikli out of Estiona<br>
Rafael Chyla out of Germany/Poland<br>
Nathan Dahlberg, Tim Vincent and Craig Tompson all out of New Zealand.<br>
For the last two this will be the longest and hardest race they've ever done<br>
The competition includes Malaysian National team along with 11 other Malaysian
teams , two teams from Uzibekistan, and the Indonesians for a total of 86
starters.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
Stage 1.<br>
15km Time Trial.<br>
All aero equipment was banned so the opening time trial was a&nbsp; real race of
truth!<br>
Time trial specialist Iratov Damir still came out on top posting 18 min, 14 sec
(48km/hr average) but this time Peep and Nathan came in 2nd and 3rd (18:35 and
18:43 respectively) as the other Uzbekistan riders without the aero bikes they
used previously came in behind. Rafael also showed good form finishing 6th.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
Stage 2.<br>
140km Road Stage to Bundar Jenku.<br>
Although the stage was mainly into a head wind, a fast pace was maintained
through the tropical forest all day. The Uzbekistan riders, who have two teams
in the race, spent all day on the front controlling the race, but in the last
30km, 5 riders broke clear. They were Peep, Nathan, Iratov (the leader) plus
Indonesians Ton Ton and Sulistiyo. Peep was looking very strong but it was
Nathan who jumped away in the last km leaving Peep to win the sprint for a VP
International 1,2. The rest of the field was spread over 7 mins after what
proved to be a very tough opening road stage.<br>

</p>
<p>
<br>
Stage 3.<br>
141km Road Stage to Jerantut.<br>
Despite numerous attacks the bunch arrived intact for a crazy sprint into
Jerantut. Indonesian Matnur Matnur profited from the chaos of the last 500m
which included several tight turns through roadworks, road islands and parked
motorbikes, to win the sprint. VP International failed to place.<br>
</p>
<p>
Stage 4.<br>
61km Team Time Trial.<br>
Team Time Trials are tough at the best of times, but the course between Jerantut
and Kuala Lipis was a killer with 39 x 23 climbs and hardly an inch of flat. The
Uzbekistan A team showed its strength by taking 1 min 40 sec out of nearest
rivals VP International. The Malaysian National Team were a further 30 seconds
back in third. The Indonesian team of climbers lost a lot of time, nearly 5 mins
to the Uzbecks.<br>
</p>
<p>
Stage 5.<br>
187km Road Stage to Raub.<br>
The longest stage so far but no-one was slowing down any. The Uzbeck teams
controlled attacks from the start for Irator who now had a 2 min buffer to Peep
and Nathan. After numerous attacks on rolling hills mid-course, Rafael escaped
with a group of 5 and 65km to go. The Uzbecks limited the gap to 2 mins and many
strong attacks in the last 10km saw the group caught by a small group of 10
riders in the last 2km, but not before Rafael had jumped away from it. A move
that earned him the stage win. Craig won the sprint from group behind Raphael
and got second.<br>
<br>
Stage 6.<br>
61km Road Stage to Raub.<br>
The shortest road stage of the Tour and the first 20km was ridden at training
pace. Was it an indication of fatigue from the day before or anticipation of the
next day's 'King' stage up to the Genting Highlands? That all changed at the
first sprint prime. The points jersey, previously worn by VP International
riders Nathan and Peep, was now worn by Wan Wan Setibudi. A text-book lead out
from VP International at the first sprint to reclaim the jersey, was no obstacle
for Wan Wan who still beat the VP sprinters and stregthened his grip on the
jersey.<br>
Action really followed with numerous attacks, field splits, a puncture from Peep,
a wheel change with Craig. Finally VP International took contol in the final kms
and Rafael made no mistake to win his second stage in a row from Wan Wan.<br>
<br>
<b>
Oktober 25</b>
</p>
<p>Stage 7.
</p>
<p>The King's stage to Genting Highlands has been a incredibly tough one! 39 x
25 for 20 km's!!! (Incredible Mountain!!) I failed to get the yellow jersey. I
did beat every rider in front of me in the GC, but not by enough time... In the
General Classment I am 4th now, three Uzbeks are leading. The difference was
more then 2 minutes before this stage and now 1 min 04. They beat us by 1 min 40
in the Team Time Trial, so it's not hard to find out where we lost it.
</p>
<p>I was third on the stage, Ton Ton won.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The team is second (after Uzbeks of course), Raphael has the Sprint jersey,
Peep is 10th, Ullzii 11th in GC.
