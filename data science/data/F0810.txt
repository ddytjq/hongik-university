<p></font><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">Most successful IT professionals share a common
desire to keep their skills up to date and to get the best available rates for the most
challenging and interesting assignments available.&nbsp; Keeping your skills up to date is
no easy task as the rate of technology change can be rapid and sometimes
mind-bogling.&nbsp; New versions of developement tools are frequently being released,
brand new technologies are emerging every day, new bugs are being discovered.&nbsp; Unless
you are constanly upgrading and retraining, you could find yourself stale within six
months.&nbsp; Also, if you always do only what you're expert at, the skill is soon
outdated and you are no longer marketable. Here are some of the resources that can help
you <a href="zedge.htm">keep your skills at the leading edge.</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2"><strong>Just getting started</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">If you are new to this field, it can get very confusing
trying to figure out where to start.&nbsp; There are many training courses and books out
there promising great results.&nbsp; Sometimes it is hard to tell which ones are valuable
and which ones are just a waste of time?&nbsp; Here are some suggestions on <a href="training.htm">where to get started.</a></font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">Finding the right career</font></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">If you are in technology business, you should consider
yourself fortunate.&nbsp; The media keeps telling us that there is a great shortage of
skilled IT labour in North America and that it is difficult for many companies to find and
keep good people.&nbsp; However, finding that next great assignment or even a full-time
job is not always that easy.&nbsp; There are several ways of looking for one including
personal networking, <a href="headhunt.htm">employment agencies</a> or even <a href="inetjobs.htm">on-line job search boards</a>. </font></p>
