      <P><I><FONT SIZE="-1">The August issue of Footnotes, newsletter
      of the Tarheel Chapter BMW CCA contained an interesting article
      entitled &quot;Have You Attended One of Our Driving Schools?&quot;
      by Peter Reinhart. Peter has graciously re-written it &quot;for
      a broader appeal&quot; [e.g., removed those big words only BMW
      owners can understand]. In case you haven't met Peter, check
      your mirrors&#133;he may be that <A HREF="http://www.neuro.duke.edu/phr/m3.html">red
      M3</A> bearing down on you, although it could be his co-driver
      Chris Foster, so careful with those creative passing gestures.
      And apologies to Peter for my added comments&#133;just couldn't
      help myself - coco</FONT></I></P>

      <H1><CENTER>Have You Attended a Driving School?<BR>
      <FONT SIZE="+2">by <A HREF="mailto:billabong@neuro.duke.edu">Peter
      Reinhart</A></FONT></CENTER></H1>

      <P>A question that seems to come up frequently is - <I>&quot;<B>I've
      heard Driving Schools are a lot of fun and teach me a lot about
      how my car handles, but what do I need to do to prepare my car
      and myself?</B>&quot;</I></P>

      <P>The short answer is - not very much. For your first event
      you really only need to do four things:</P>

      <P><B>(1)</B> Sign up for an event, such as one of the events
      listed on Coco Strayer's outstanding site (http://www.trackschedule.com/)
      [<I>Honestly! Peter wrote this in the original article with no
      prompting from me.</I> ;-) ]. For many events you can now even
      download the application form directly from club websites. Keep
      in mind that for many events you will need to sign up early,
      as they can fill quickly. If you applied early enough this will
      result in you receiving a package of information from the Driving
      School Committee within a few weeks. For our own Chapter Driving
      Schools you can see a list of participants on our website.</P>

      <P><B>(2)</B> Organize your helmet. Once you know you're <B><I>in</I></B>
      for your first driving event borrow or rent a helmet. To work
      out your size measure your head circumference one inch above
      the eyebrows in front and at a point in the back of the head
      that results in the largest possible measurement. Inches are
      translated into sizes as follows.</P>

      <P>Make sure the helmet is rated <B><I>Snell 95 SA</I></B> for
      motorsports applications (<B><I>Snell 95 M</I></B> is for motorcycle
      helmets). A good source for rental helmets is OG Racing (800-934-9112).
      They charge $25 for an open face helmet and $35 for a full-face
      helmet. You're responsible for shipping the helmet back to them.
      If you get into this more, you'll want to buy your own helmet.
      Use your first driving school to check out other people's helmets
      and ask them about their choice. [<I>For a large selection of
      helmets that you can try before you buy: The Simpson World store
      in Mooresville, NC is a great place to spend a rainy afternoon
      with your favorite credit card!</I>]</P>

      <P><B>(3)</B> Book your hotel room. The club has a <B><I>headquarters</I></B>
      hotel that usually has very reasonable rates. You won't be in
      your room much&#133; [<I>and you'll be dog-tired when you are
      there so don't be too concerned about that lumpy mattress or
      thin walls&#133;you'll never notice after a day at the track!</I>]</P>

      <P><B>(4)</B> A week or so prior to the event clean everything
      out of your car and have it inspected by your favorite mechanic.
      The relevant <B><I>inspection form</I></B> will be part of the
      package sent to you by the Driver School Committee, or you may
      be able to download it. One of my favorite places to go is Krause
      &amp; England (919-781-1871) out on Rt. 70 near the RDU airport.
      Peter Krause always has a number of interesting cars in his shop.
      The inspection will be over before you've finished drooling over
      some of the Ferraris or Lamborghinis he's prepping.</P>

      <P><B>That's it! Really!!</B> There are a few other things you
      may want to take with you (see list below), but for the first
      school, people will help you out with anything else you might
      need. Once you've done a few driving events you may want to pack
      some of the items listed below.</P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Driving School Checklist</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The last driving school I attended I forgot
      &#133;.my helmet! Fairly embarrassing when you roll up to grid-tech
      inspection and the volunteer inspectors ask to see the Snell
      rating of your helmet. Ouch! Since then I've assembled a checklist
      of track items ranging from essential to desirable. Thought maybe
      this list would be useful for other folk as well.</FONT></P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">A. Essential Items</FONT></B></P>

      <UL>
        <LI>Helmet - don't leave home without it
        <LI>Tarp - keeps all you stuff covered when it rains
        <LI>Filled-out tech inspection, health, helmet forms and your
        hotel confirmation number - all the paperwork
        <LI>Sunglasses, suntan lotion, water-proof poncho, hat - keeps
        you covered when it rains and when it doesn't
        <LI>Cooler - keep all of your drinks cool. Bring lots of water.
        <LI>3 quarts of oil - check your oil between <B>every</B> run
        <LI>Brake fluid - it's good to be able to stop
        <LI>Window cleaner and paper towels - it's good to see well
        <LI>3 or 4 long-sleeved t-shirts - for safety reasons most events
        insist you wear long-sleeved tops.
      </UL>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">B. Desirable Items</FONT></B></P>

      <UL>
        <LI>Torque wrench, correct socket for your lug nuts, torque settings
        for your car
        <LI>Tire pressure gauge
        <LI>Camera - take pictures of those 'tough' corners during parade
        laps
        <LI>A few tools i.e. enough to bleed brakes, change pads...
        <LI>Spare set of brake pads - you never know when you'll run
        out
        <LI>5 gallon fuel container - particularly if 2 of you are sharing
        a car
        <LI>Long-necked funnel - tough to get fuel into the tank without
        one
        <LI>Racers Tape - protect those driving lights, change your run
        group etc.
        <LI>White Shoe Polish - change your car number
        <LI>Folding Chairs - sit in comfort
        <LI>Comfortable driving shoes - thin soled with minimal edges
        are best
        <LI>Spare key - I always bring a single spare key. I hate the
        jingle of a bunch of keys when on the track, and it also saves
        you from getting locked out.
      </UL>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">C. Track Junkie Extras</FONT></B></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The list of equipment track junkies can bring
      to the track is almost endless. In part this is due to the fact
      that these people trailer their cars. Ergo - much more room to
      fill with stuff. Some of the more popular items are:</FONT></P>

      <UL>
        <LI>3-ton car jack and flat board to place it on
        <LI>More tools
        <LI>Set of track wheels with R-compound rubber
        <LI>Canopy for shade
      </UL>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1">To get you into the right frame of mind for
      your first school you may want to look at <B><I>Going Faster
      : Mastering the Art of Race Driving : The Skip Barber Racing
      School</I></B> by Carl Lopez and Danny Sullivan. This book has
      received rave reviews, which I can second. Even though there
      is no racing at driving schools, most of the concepts discussed
      in this book apply to driving in general. Approx. $23 online
      from <A HREF="http://www.buy.com/">http://www.buy.com</A> . So
      sign up and see for yourself what a great resource these driving
      schools really are.</FONT></P>
