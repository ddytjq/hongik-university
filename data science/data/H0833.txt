<h3> Abstract </h3>
</center>

Artificial neural networks have been combined with a rule based system to predict intron
    splice sites in the dicot plant 
<em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> . A two step prediction scheme, where
    a global prediction of the coding potential regulates a cutoff level for a local prediction of
    splice sites, is refined by rules based on splice site confidence values, prediction scores,
    coding context and distances between potential splice sites. In this approach, the
    prediction of splice sites mutually affect each other in a non-local manner. The combined
    approach drastically reduces the large amount of false positive splice sites normally
    haunting splice site prediction. An analysis of the errors made by the networks in the first
    step of the method revealed a previously unknown feature, a frequent T-tract
    prolongation containing cryptic acceptor sites in the 5 ' end of exons. The method
    presented here has been compared with three other approaches, GeneFinder, GeneMark
    and Grail. Overall the method presented here is an order of magnitude better. We show
    that the new method is able to find a donor site in the coding sequence for the jelly fish
    Green Fluorescent Protein, exactly at the position that was experimentally observed in
    A.thaliana transformants. Predictions for alternatively spliced genes are also presented,
    together with examples of genes from other dicots, monocots and algae. The method has
    been made available through electronic mail
