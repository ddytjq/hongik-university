1. In these Terms and Conditions:
<P>'Account' means a Business Direct Account, Business Select Deposit Accounts
and Corporate Reserve Account.
<P>'Bank' means The Co-operative Bank p.l.c. of P.O. Box 101, I Balloon Street,
Manchester M60 4EP.
<P>'BCS' means Business Customer Services.
<P>'Business Select
'Deposit Accounts' means the Instant Access, 14 Day and 30 Day Deposit Accounts.
<P>'Customer' means the company, organisation, partnership, trust, society, club, sole
trader or individual in whose name or in the name of which the Account
is opened.
<P>'HandyBank' means those branches of the bank notified to the Customer as
'HandyBanks' from time to time.
<P>2. The minimum age for opening an Account is 18. Customers will not be allowed to draw on
any initial deposits until the Account is opened and all funds are cleared.
<P>3. The bank reserves the right to refuse a deposit, or decline to open an Account or to require a depositor to close the Account without giving a reason for any such decision. However, the bank will not close an Account without sound financial, business or legal reasons and will
give at least one month's notice of its intention to do so. The bank reserves the right at any
time to require references and/or completion of mandates.
<P>4. Cheques issued may be made payable to third parties and may be drawn for any amount. In
the case of a Joint Account in the names of two or more persons, the bank has authority to
debit the Account with cheques and/or orders signed by any one or the survivor of the
Account holders (Partnerships only).
<P>5. Interest is calculated on cleared balances on a daily basis. The interest rate to be paid by the bank will be the rate notified by the bank from time to time for such Accounts. For deposits made at a 'HandyBank' please allow up to ten working days for the funds to reach the
Account.
<P>6. If the ledger balance of the Account falls below the minimum balance required to run this
Account, interest will be paid at the published rate.
<P>7. Account holders are NOT permitted to overdraw. If there are insufficient cleared funds in the Account to meet cheques and/or other items presented for payment, they will be returned
unpaid and a charge at the rate current at the time will be levied for each item so
dishonoured. Cheques and/or other items negotiated by the bank and which are returned or
dishonoured for other than technical irregularities will incur a charge for each item. Should
circumstances arise whereby an overdraft is inadvertently created, overdraft interest will be
charged. A monthly service charge will be applied to the Account in addition to the bank's
standard overdraft charges. In the event that the Account is in joint names, the Account
holders will be jointly and severally liable for debt due. (Partnerships Only).
<P>8. Statements are issued each time 25 transactions have gone through a Customer's Business
Current Account, every six months for Business Select Deposit Accounts and monthly for a
Corporate Reserve Account, or on request.
<P>9. Post dated cheques must not be issued. The bank reserves the right to treat a post dated
cheque as if dated on the date of receipt and may pay the cheque on that day.
<P>10. There will be no facility for the return of paid cheques or vouchers.
<P>11. Cheques sent through the post will be credited to a Customer's Account on the day of
receipt. Cash and cheques deposited through the bank's depositories (except for
HandyBanks) will be credited within five working days to a Customer's Account.
<P>12. Customers will be pre-notified of the Account charges 16 days prior to the 5th day of each month. The Account will be charged on the 5th day of each month or the nearest working
day prior to the 5th.
<P>13.
<BR>(a) All overseas Inward Payments expressed in foreign currency received by the bank
destined for an Account will be converted into sterling at the rate obtainable by the bank
for similar accounts, on the date of receipt of such foreign funds.
<BR>(b) Any items requiring clearance and not denominated in sterling but drawn on Bank
branches outside the UK which are sent to BCS for credit of an Account will be sent for
payment on a collection basis. Once the cleared proceeds have been received from the
drawee bank, they will be converted to sterling at a rate obtainable by the bank for
similar amounts at that time.
<P>14. Where lodgements are made by Bank Giro Credit through other branches or banks in the
UK, the bank reserves the right to recover (by debit to the depositor's Account) the amount
of any interbranch/interbank charges which may be levied against any of the Business
Accounts in respect of these transactions.
<P>15. The bank reserves the right to levy charges for any additional services provided and details may be obtained on request.
<P>16. Any stop payment orders given to the bank must specify the exact amount of the cheque,
the Account number, the payee, the date and the serial number of the cheque. A charge will
be made for each stop payment order.
<P>17. Any instructions regarding a standing order or direct debit must be made in writing.
No acknowledgement will be given unless specifically requested by the Customer.
<P>18. All changes of address must be notified immediately by the Account holder in writing to
the bank at the BCS address.
<P>19. The bank shall not be liable if it is unable to perform its obligations under this agreement due (directly or indirectly) to the failure of any machine, data processing systems, or any transmission link or any dispute, or anything outside the control of the bank, its agents
or sub-contractors. The bank will endeavour to make alternative payment/deposit
arrangements for customers where this is feasible in the event of a postal strike.
<P>20. With a 14 Day account, should a Customer wish to make a withdrawal without giving
14 days' notice, a Customer may do so subject to loss of 14 days' interest.

<P>1. DEFINITIONS:
<P>Service: the service provided by the bank via its Business Customer Services.
<P>Bank: The Co-operative Bank p.l.c. of P.O. Box 101, I Balloon Street,
Manchester M60 4EP.
<P>The Customer: the person (or persons) or corporate body whose name, address and
current account number are given in the Registration Form.
<P>Pass-Number: the number which is selected by the Customer for use every time the
Customer uses the Service.
<P>2. PASS-NUMBER:
<P>It is the Customer's responsibility to ensure that its Pass-Number is kept confidential. This is to prevent any unauthorised person using the Service.
<P> If the Customer knows or even suspects that someone else knows its Pass-Number, it
should telephone the bank's Business Customer Services on 0345 215 215 immediately.
We will then be able to allocate a new Pass-Number.
<P>3. INSTRUCTIONS:
<P>3.1 The Customer irrevocably authorises the bank to act upon telephoned instructions received
through the Service provided they are accompanied by use of the correct Pass-Number. In
the case of a Joint or Corporate Account, authorisation is required from only one of the
account holders or authorised signatories.
<P>3.2 The authority given above will continue to apply during any period of notice of termination of the Service whether given by the bank or the Customer or one of its representatives.
<P>3.3 the bank reserves the right to refuse to implement such instructions if it feels there is a justifiable reason.
<P>4. VARIATION:
<P>4.1 the bank may add to, vary, suspend or terminate any part of the Service at any time.
It will, of course, try to inform the Customer of any changes as soon as possible.
<P>4.2 the bank may also vary, amend or add to the Terms and Conditions of the Service. Any
variation will come into effect once notice has been given to the Customer. This will
generally be through use of either a notice in the bank's branches or over the Service
telephone or fax lines.
<P>5. TERMINATION:
<P>5.1 The Customer can terminate their Service use agreement by giving at least seven days
notice in writing to the bank.
<P>5.2 the bank reserves the right to discontinue the Service to the Customer at any time.
It will always endeavour to inform the Customer that the Service has been withdrawn.
