<h1>Thunderhill Park</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Located on 540 acres of rolling hills off I-5 in California's
central valley, Thunderhill Park Raceway is an
<a href="/Organizations/SCCA/">SCCA</a>
owned and operated facility, run by the SCCA's
<a href="http://www.sfrscca.com/">San Francisco Region</a>.
It is located about 75 miles north of
Sacramento.  The residents of the nearby town of Willows welcomed the
new racing facility and the local business which it attracts.

<P>
The current configuration of the track is a 1.9 mile long
counterclockwise loop, with limited paddock area.  There are plans for
considerable lengthening of the track and expansion of the paddock.
The track has nine numbered turns and a very long main straight.  There
is a short track option in turn 7.  This option bypasses turns 8, 8A
and 9.  There is a fairly large hot pit, but no cold pit.  There are no
spectator areas, but most of the track can be seen from the paddock.

<h2><a name="HistoricalNote">Historical Note</a></h2>

The track is relatively young.  The first races were held in 1994.  It is
located inside of the Thunderhill Ranch; the owners of Thunderhill Ranch
sold a small section in the center of their property to the San Francisco
Region of the SCCA for the express purpose of building a race track there.

<h2><a name="GettingThere">Getting to Thunderhill</a></h2>

From the San Francisco Bay Area, take I-80 east to I-505 north and
then to I-5 north.  Exit in Willows on Highway 162, and head about 6
miles west of town to Thunderhill.  Rumor has it that 162 is patrolled
on event weekends.

<EM>
[Note: This is a description of a qualifying or school line.  A
racing situation will require a more defensive line through some
corners.]
</EM>

<P>
Exit pit lane to the far right.  Watch for oncoming traffic setting up
for the left-hand turn 1.  Don't turn-in too late at 1 or you will get
out in the marbles and have bad camber as well.  The apex to 1 is mid
to late.  A mild rise near the apex will lighten the car.  The exit is
near the end of the burm on the outside.  There may be a drop-off at
the edge of the track after the burm where cars have dug a rut in the
dirt.

<P> 
There is a short, slightly downhill straight leading up to turn 2,
a long, wide carousel with a very late apex.  This is a very good turn
to work on the limits and the balance of the car.  There are some bumps
in the beginning 1/3 of 2.  There are a couple lines to avoid the
bumps.  Formula cars like a tight line.  Street cars like a wide line,
about 2/3 away from the inside edge.  The apex is a bit hard to see
from the entrance, but the black pavement patches on driver's left can
be used as reference points in lining up the turn.  After clipping a
late apex, drift out to the burm on driver's right.  Near the end of
the burm is a good spot to exit.

<P> 
Now quickly get back across to setup for the right-hand turn 3.
Move to about 1/3 the track width away from the edge at drivers left.
There is a bit of a crest leading to the entrance of the turn.  Braking
should be done before the crest.  The turn itself is very late apex and
significantly off camber, so the entry will probably feel a bit slow.
Take a gentle arc to a very late apex, using gentle throttle
application to avoid excessive power slide.  The apex is hidden by the
hill, but there is a small white concrete patch in the asphalt which
can be used as a mid-turn reference point.  Turn 4 is a fast
left-hander, so 3 is sacrificed with a very late apex to setup for a
good entry to 4.  The transition must be fast and smooth.  Don't toss
the car through here.

<P>
Some cars may need slight braking out of 3 to set up for 4; others can
be flat.  The apex for 4 is late.  At the entrance, look through the
apex and up the hill to the entrance to 5.  This will help keep a nice,
straight stable line out of 4 and into 5.

<P>
Turn 5, a.k.a. the Cyclone, is where you learn to trust your corner
workers.  It is reminiscent of the Corkscrew at Laguna Seca, but is
faster and blinder.  The Cyclone consists of a sharp left-hand turn
at the top of a ridge followed by a right-hand off-camber sweeper.
Brake in a straight line coming up the hill, downshift to second, and
turn in early, perhaps sooner than feels right.  Begin to straighten
and sqeeze the throttle as you crest.  If you have aimed correctly, you
will be against the burm on drivers right on the way down.  This is a
good place to grab third.  Modulate the throttle through the right-hand
sweeper, drift out, but bring the car back to driver's right to set up
for the left hand turn 6.

<P>
Turn 6 may call for some lift to settle the car.  Turn in and aim for a
late apex.  Throttle steer through the apex out to the exit burm.  The
exit is about 1/4 from the end of the burm.  Exit speed is very
important because 7 is really a long dogleg straight.

<P>
As you exit 6, pick up the entrance to 8 to guide your line through
seven.  Turn 8 will call for the heaviest braking on the course.  Turns
8 and 8A should be taken as a single turn.  The best line may be to
take it a little wide at the "apex" of 8, focusing on hitting the true
apex at 8A.  The real key through this set of turns is to get the
throttle down early.


<P>
It's very important to get a good run through 9 for a fast exit speed
onto the main straight.  Turn 9 has a drop near the apex as the curved
section transitions onto the flat straightaway.  This can upset the
car, so pick your line carefully.  There is plenty of run-off room at
the exit of nine.  If you need it, use it.  Jerking the car back on
track will hook you across the track into the only armco on the track
-- the pit wall.


<P>
As you exit 9, watch for cars slowing to get to the pit entrance over
on driver's right.  This is a good time to check your guages.  As you
pass start-finish and the end of the pit wall, you will want to move to
driver's right to set up for turn one.  Watch for cars entering the
track.
