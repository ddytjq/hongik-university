Aspart of this program, ISIS has developed a software application known asI-SPINE (ISIS's Spine Procedure Imaging Navigation Engine). I-SPINE is aWindows NT application, which is based on the Analyze/AVM libraries. Thesoftware architecture follows the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) singledocument, multiple view paradigm. This has allowed the developers to add newvisualization modules to I-SPINE that aid physicians in procedures outside thespine. One such procedure I-SPINE has been expanded for is uterine fibroidembolization. The idea is that by registering and subtracting post-embolizationangiographic images from pre-treatment images the resulting image can be usedto quantify the embolization effect on the fibroid circulation and predict thetreatment response. The I-SPINE digital subtraction angiography (DSA) moduleallows the interventional radiologist to open a series of pre andpost-embolization DSA images that shows the vascular structures of the uterusand the fibroid or fibroids. From these images, the radiologist selects anappropriate image from each series. The selected images are then handregistered using pixel shifting. Once the images are registered, the pixels aresubtracted resulting in an image that shows the embolized arteries that weresupplying the fibroids.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Angiography,-Digital-Subtraction-instrumentation;*Embolization,-Therapeutic-instrumentation; *Leiomyoma-therapy;*Software-Design; *Uterine-Neoplasms-therapy<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Computer-Systems; Leiomyoma-blood-supply;Uterine-Neoplasms-blood-supply<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Support,-U.S.-Gov't,-Non-P.H.S.<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  instrumentation; blood-supply; therapy<p>SUBSET:  Health-Technology-Assessment<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  20318139<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 2 of 63 in MEDLINE (R) 2000<p>TITLE:  Interhemispheric transfer of language in patients with left frontalcerebral arteriovenous malformation.<p>AUTHOR:  Lazar,-R-M; Marshall,-R-S; Pile-Spellman,-J; Duong,-H-C; Mohr,-J-P;Young,-W-L; Solomon,-R-L; Perera,-G-M; DeLaPaz,-R-L<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Neurology, Columbia University College ofPhysicians &amp; Surgeons, NY, New York, USA. ral22@columbia.edu<p>SOURCE:  Neuropsychologia. 2000; 38(10): 1325-32<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0028-3932<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  2000<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  ENGLAND<p>ABSTRACT:  Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are frequently evaluatedbefore therapeutic embolization by superselective injection of anesthetics intoindividual arterial branches so as to determine whether permanent occlusionwould affect eloquent function. In Experiment 1, we used this adaptation of theWada procedure to study three right-handed adult patients with left frontalcerebral AVMs by injecting vessels in Wernicke's and Broca's areas,respectively, and assessing language functions. The results showed thatsuperselective testing in the inferior division of the left MCA in all threepatients produced a dense Wernicke's aphasia. Injections into the left frontalregions, however, resulted in right paresis in all patients, but no languagedeficits including no loss of fluency. In Experiment 2, Patient 2 underwentfMRI activation for spontaneous word-list generation using multi-slice echoplanar BOLD techniques at 1.5 Tesla. A voxel-by-voxel comparison of rest vsactivation for each task was performed with a Z-score threshold of 2.5 SD foractivated voxels. There was activation in the right hemisphere in the insula,frontal operculum pars opercularis, and inferior frontal gyrus, an areahomologous to Broca's area in the left hemisphere. There was also activation inthe left hemisphere in the Rolandic region, but language function wasunaffected during Wada testing in this area. These data suggested that featuresof expressive language were no longer controlled by the left frontal lobe wherethe AVM was located, and provided new evidence for interhemisphericre-organization under conditions of chronic neurovascular disease.<p>MAJOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  *Cognition-drug-effects;*Frontal-Lobe-physiopathology;*Intracranial-Arteriovenous-Malformations-physiopathology; *Language-<p>MINOR MESH DESCRIPTORS:  Adult-; Amobarbital-administration-and-dosage;Anesthetics,-Local-administration-and-dosage;Aphasia,-Wernicke-chemically-induced; Cerebral-Angiography;Echo-Planar-Imaging; Frontal-Lobe-blood-supply; Frontal-Lobe-drug-effects;Frontal-Lobe-pathology; Injections,-Intra-Arterial;Intracranial-Arteriovenous-Malformations-diagnosis;Intracranial-Arteriovenous-Malformations-pathology; Language-Tests;Laterality-; Lidocaine-administration-and-dosage; Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging;Middle-Age; Middle-Cerebral-Artery; Paresis-chemically-induced;Sedatives,-Barbiturate-administration-and-dosage; Temporal-Lobe-drug-effects;Temporal-Lobe-physiopathology<p>CHECKTAGS:  Female; Human; Male; Support,-Non-U.S.-Gov't;Support,-U.S.-Gov't,-P.H.S.<p>PUBLICATION TYPE:  Clinical-Trial; Journal-Article<p>SUBHEADINGS:  administration-and-dosage; chemically-induced; drug-effects;blood-supply; pathology; physiopathology; diagnosis<p>CAS REGISTRY NUMBER OR EC NUMBER:  0; 0; 137-58-6; 57-43-2<p>NAME OF SUBSTANCE:  Anesthetics,-Local; Sedatives,-Barbiturate; Lidocaine;Amobarbital<p>CONTRACT OR GRANT NUMBERS:  NS27713NSNINDS<p>SUBSET:  Index-Medicus<p>UPDATE CODE:  20001218<p>ACCESSION NUMBER:  20330311<p>RECORD FEATURES:  ABSTRACT (AB)<p>Record 3 of 63 in MEDLINE (R) 2000<p>TITLE:  Interhemispheric transfer of language in patients with left frontalcerebral arteriovenous malformation.<p>AUTHOR:  Lazar,-R-M; Marshall,-R-S; Pile-Spellman,-J; Duong,-H-C; Mohr,-J-P;Young,-W-L; Solomon,-R-L; Perera,-G-M; DeLaPaz,-R-L<p>ADDRESS OF AUTHOR:  Department of Neurology, Columbia University College ofPhysicians &amp; Surgeons, NY, New York, USA. ral22@columbia.edu<p>SOURCE:  Neuropsychologia. 2000; 38(10): 1325-32<p>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD SERIAL NUMBER:  0028-3932<p>PUBLICATION YEAR:  2000<p>LANGUAGE:  English<p>COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION:  ENGLAND<p>ABSTRACT:  Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are frequently evaluatedbefore therapeutic embolization by superselective injection of anesthetics intoindividual arterial branches so as to determine whether permanent occlusionwould affect eloquent function.
