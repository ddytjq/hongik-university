<h1>APPENDIX World Flying Disc Federation World Record
regulations</h1>

<hr>

<h3>Ground Rules</h3>

<p><b>Individual Events:</b> </p>

<p>In order to receive sanction as an official record, the
performance must take place under WFDF competitive format at a
meet which is sanctioned by WFDF or a national member
association. The information about a new record must be sent to
the WFDF board as soon as possible. This must be done on a World
Record<a href="wfdfrecr.htm"> report form</a>, which must be
completely filled out and accompanied by evidence that the
tournament was properly organized and sanctioned.</p>

<h3>Special Notes:</h3>

<p><b>Distance:</b> The throw must be made over level ground. No
noticeable degree of slope is acceptable. There is no restriction
on wind level for the outdoor record. Measure to the nearest
centimeter.</p>

<p><b>MTA:</b> Three watches must record the event with the
median of the three times being used as the official result.
Ground must be level. Time to hundredths of a second.</p>

<p><b>Accuracy:</b> The target and field must meet WFDF
standards.</p>

<p><b>Children's, Canine, Mini and All Others Listed Under
&quot;Other Records&quot;:</b> Attempts on these records may be
made outside of normal competition, but must conform to
competitive standards for field layout and measuring.</p>

<p>Number of attempts for distance, MTA and TRC should be limited
to two sets of five within a 15 minute period. If there is doubt
about the rules, it is recommended that the strictest
interpretation be adopted. For any attempt, expert officiating by
impartial witnesses is desirable.</p>

<p><b>Guts Speed Catch</b>: A professional model Frisbee disc
must be delivered and caught behind the respective foul line on a
regulation guts court (14 m apart). The catch must be clean:
caught cleanly in one hand with no bobbling or trapping against
body. The speed must be electronically timed by a radar device
operated by qualified personnel.</p>

<p><b>Marathon Ultimate or Guts:</b> Play must be held under
official WFDF rules with normal halftimes or time-outs and 10
minutes between each &quot;game.&quot; Unlimited substitution is
allowed with a maximum of 15 players per ultimate team and seven
per guts team.</p>

<p><strong>Wheelchair Records:</strong> The field event records
for players in wheelchairs are divided in to categories
determined by the player's level of disability:</p>

<p>Class 1 - paralyzed from the chest down<br>
Class 2 - paralyzed from the waist down<br>
Class 3 - amputee or full hip mobility<br>
</p>

<h3>Group Records:</h3>

<p>Discs used in all of the following records must meet vintage
class specification <a href="art8.htm#804.08">(see section
804.08[A]</a>).</p>

<ul>
    <li>(A) Group Marathon: An unlimited number of participants
        is allowed. At least two players must be playing at any
        time, at a distance of at least 14 m. No more than 30
        seconds may pass without an exchange.</li>
    <li>(B) Two-person Marathon: Play must be from at least 14 m.
        No more than 30 seconds may pass without an exchange
        during the attempt. Five minute rest intervals are
        permitted, but only after each completed hour. These rest
        breaks are optional and may be accumulated (for example,
        3 hours of activity earns 15 minutes of rest time, etc.).
        Violation of the rest interval rules will disqualify an
        attempt. The accepted record will be the gross time
        (total elapsed time, including rest intervals, from start
        to finish). However, unused accumulated rest break time
        cannot be added to the final figure. In the very nature
        of record-breaking, the duration of &quot;marathons&quot;
        will tend to be pushed to greater and greater extremes.
        It should be stressed that marathon attempts are not
        without possible dangers. Those responsible for marathon
        events would be well counseled to seek medical advice
        before, and surveillance during, marathons which involve
        extended periods with little or no sleep.</li>
    <li>(C) 24 Hour Pair Distance: The playing field is
        determined by two parallel lines which are to be at least
        10 m apart. Any greater separation may be used and
        altered during the attempt, if accurate documentation is
        maintained. The distance between the lines is to be added
        to the total distance covered each time the disc is
        transferred from a player holding the disc while standing
        behind a foul line to being held by a player standing
        behind the opposite foul line. The disc may be moved in
        any way including being carried from behind one line to
        behind the other. Short throws must be picked up and
        carried behind the line to get credit for the distance.
        Overthrows may be thrown back from well behind the line
        but credit is only given for the distance between the
        lines on each transfer. Time begins with the release of
        the first throw and final measurement should be made to
        the point at which the disc is held or flying at the end
        of 24 hours. If a disc is replaced it must enter play at
        the exact point the previous disc was removed. Players
        may take breaks as desired.</li>
    <li>(D) 24 Hour Group Distance: An unlimited number of
        players may participate. Only four players may perform at
        any given time. To insure comparability of all attempts,
        play must take place on an official group distance field
        with the minimum side length being 10 m. Players are
        stationed A,B,C, and D with the disc being thrown either
        A-B-C-D or the reverse. For a lap to be completed, the
        disc must be held by a player standing in each of the
        corner sites extended. If a throw is errant, it must be
        retrieved, taken to the site, and thrown to the next
        site. A lap judge must constantly be present to log
        players and record laps. Time begins with the release of
        the first throw and final measurement should be made to
        the point at which the disc is held or flying at the end
        of 24 hours. If a disc is replaced it must enter play at
        the exact point the previous disc was removed.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Documentation and Verification:</b> No particular form is
required, and no entry fee is payable. In any case, the burden of
proof rests with the claimant. No claim that is insufficiently
documented can be accepted as accurate.</p>

<p>Claimants should obtain independent corroboration in the form
of local or national newspaper, radio or TV coverage. Newspaper
clippings must be annotated with the name of the newspaper, its
place of publication, and the date of issue in which the article
appeared. When possible, the name of the reporter and
black-and-white and/or color action photograph should also be
supplied. Video tapes should not be sent, but held in reserve in
the event further documentation is requested.</p>

<p>Claimants should send signed authentication by independent,
impartial adult witnesses or representative of organizations of
standing in their community. Where applicable, a signed document
showing ratification by a governing body should be supplied (see
above). A claim is naturally enhanced by a witness with a high
degree of expertise in the area of endeavor.</p>

<p>Signed log books should show there has been unremitting
surveillance in the case of endurance events. These log books
must include, in chronological order, the times of the activity
and the times and durations of all rest breaks taken. The log
books must be legible and readily decipherable. They must include
signatures of witnesses with times of entering and leaving (at
least two independent witnesses must be on hand at all times).
Where applicable, scoresheets must be kept to demonstrate a
satisfactory rate of play.</p>

<p>All submissions become the property of WFDF. WFDF will
consider, but not guarantee, the return of material, only if a
self-addressed, stamped envelope is supplied with sufficient
postage.</p>

<p><b>Special Note:</b>The WFDF serves as a clearing house for
all flying disc records for Guinness Superlatives Ltd. Prior to
the printing of each edition, existing records for the various
categories are forwarded to the Guinness offices for inclusion.
They reserve the right, however, to print those records which
they feel are best suited for publication.</p>
