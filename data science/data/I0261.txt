    <td>An all to familiar scenario seemed to be unfolding at Bath City when it was announced
    late in 1997 that the club's directors were looking to sell their Twerton Park ground for
    redevelopment. With no plans in hand to build a replacement stadium, the club faced the
    prospect of forking out a large sum of money to groundshare elsewhere. This process would
    have frittered away the proceeds of the sale of Twerton Park, probably to such an extent
    that within a couple of years not enough money would remain to build a new ground anyway.
    This type of situation has occurred too often in the past: Wealdstone. Sheppey United,
    Ilford and Romford arejust a few of the clubs that spring to mind, and the hope was that
    Bath City would not fall into the same trap. After all Twerton Pork is notjustany ground.
    Extensively improved during the 11 year stay of now departed Football League tenants
    Bristol Revers, it is one of the best non-league stadiums in the country and the thought
    of its demise, especially if no replacement was on the horizon, was an extremely
    depressing one.<p>Fortunately a group of Bath City supporters, among them film maker Ken
    Leach and Groundtastic writer Bob Brimson. decided to do something about it. They took
    over control of the club and after sfabilising the precarious financial position, set
    about discussing the future of Twerton Pork. While if was their wish to stay at the ground
    if at ail possible, it was agreed that despite all its extensive spectator facilities.
    Twerton Pork had its limitations. If ambitious plans to set up a community based football
    academy were to come to fruition, it was unclear how this could be fitted into the
    comparatively restricted land space around Twerton Park. With this in mind the new
    directors were interested to learn that some decommissioned MoD land at Foxhill in the
    Combs Down area of the city was shortly to become available.</p>
    <p>After discussions with councillors at Combs Down, an outline brief for a 'Foxhill
    Football Academy' was drawn up. The stadium would have a capacity of 4-5.000 with a 1000
    plus seater main stand and terracing on the other three sides. Permission would also be
    sought to extend the stadium to 9.000 should the need arise. The stand itself would house
    seating on one side , but built into the two storey structure would be a large social
    club/sports bor, large community hail and the remaining third would be the club offices,
    administrafion, changing rooms and meeting rooms. The terracing would be built along the
    lines of Dorchester Town's ground incorporating gables. clock towers and other facilities
    to bring an air of dignify and tradition to the ground. In addition a gymnasium would be
    built as well as an all weather pitch and a further enclosed arena up to Western ieague
    standard. It is estimated that the cost of the project would be in the region of; £4.5
    million with the finance coming from a variety of sources, including the sale of Twerton
    Park.</p>
    <p>However, the club have insisted that they would only consider a 'turnkey' arrangement
    whereby they would not leave Twerton Pork until the new facility is built. Whatever
    eventually happens, the important thing is that the destiny of Bath City is now firmly in
    the honda of the supporters. Safeguards have<br>
    been built into the club's constitution, protecting Twerton Park from the clutches of land
    speculators, ensuring that whether they decide to stay at Twerton Pork or not, it will not
    be at the behest of some faceless asset stripper with no interest in the club.</td>
