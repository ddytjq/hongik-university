Setup Tips - AKA The Checklist
<p>
<p>
<h4>
<font color=#ff0000>
NOTE:  The tips below may not be legal in your derby!
Before you make irreversible changes, check your own rules carefully!
<font color=#7000ff>
<p>
<p>
The car that works best in the demo derby is the 1964-1968 Chrysler Imperial
<br>
It works so well, in fact, that in many derby's they have been banned!
<br> 
The Imperial pictured below has been run in several derbies. 
<br>

<p>
<p>
Probably the 2nd most wanted car for the derby is the 1971-1976 GM fullsize Station Wagon.  
<br>
These cars are very heavy and came with strong frames, leaf springs, tough bumpers and good motors. 
<br>
Wagons in general are sometimes outlawed.

<p>
<p>
GM fullsize sedans (1971-1976) are probably the 3rd most wanted car for the derby.
<br>
They too are sturdy, heavy and have good motors.

<h3>
Body
<h4>
<p>
Pound up or cut out the front/rear fenders for clearance
<br>
Why: keeps tires from getting cut
<p>
Remove headlights, taillights and all trim
<br>
Why: No glass or loose parts are allowed
<p>
Remove all windows
<br>
Why: No glass is allowed
<p>
Cut 24" hole in hood 
<br>
Why:  Easy to put out fires under hood
<p>
Cut 12" hole in trunk
<br>
Why: So officials can see that you haven't cheated or filled the trunk with trash
<p>
Wire trunk and hood down (use threaded rod if allowed)
<br>
Why:  Threaded rod holds everything together nicely.  Run the threaded rod all the way through the frame.
<br>
I like wire because it is easier to use, cheaper than chain and you can get it real tight by twisting it
<p>
Where possible, replace body mounting bolts with grade 8 bolts and larger washers.  Run the bolts all the way through the frame.
<br>
Why:  Body is less likely to pull apart from the frame
<p>
When your replacing the body mounting bolts, toss the rubber bushings
<br>
Why:  Having the body sitting right on the frame, strengthens both the body and the frame
<p>
Cement in the driver's door (local rules)
<br>
Why: Protects driver from door hits
<p>
Mount bars, chains or wire where windshield used to be.  I prefer to use wire for this.  I run about 4 strands
<br>
through and then twist it nice and tight
<br>
Why: If hood comes loose, it doesn't come in and cut your head off
<p>
Weld, wire, or chain doors shut
<br>
Why:  Keeps doors from opening and also strengthens the body
<p>
Remove hood latch mechanism
<br>
Why:  If the front gets really smashed, you may have problems getting the hood open
<p>
Kink the trunk and quarter panels (coil spring cars)
<br>
Why:  The rear end of coil spring (non-GM)cars, tend to bend down.  This will help it bend up.
<p>
<p>
<h3>
Tires
<h4>
<p>
Weld a 3 inch piece of pipe around valve stems
<br>
or
<br>
Weld 2 thick bolts before and after valve stems
<br>
Why: Protects valve stem from getting sheared off
<p>
Mount tallest bias ply truck tires allowed (wider is not better) 
<br>
Why: The higher the car sits the better.  Keeps other cars from going over the top of your front bumper
<br> and smashing your radiator.  The vice-versa is true also.
<br>  Bias ply tires are tougher than radials
<p>
Run inner tubes in all tires
<br>
Why: Tires will not loose air if the bead comes off the rim
<p>
<h3>
Fuel System
<h4>
<p>
Remove gas tank and install boat motor tank 
<br>
Why: Original tanks are in a location that is easily damaged.  Since driver's door hits are against the rules,
<br>
mounting the gas tank behind the driver's seat is the safest location
<br>
Boat motor tanks also sit flat and have secure hose connections
<p>
Cover the gas tank with fiberglass insulation and cover that with half of a 55 gallon drum
<br>
Why: If the gas tank leaks, the gas cannot splash on the driver.  If the car rolls over, all the gas will be trapped
<br>
in the 55 gallon drum
<p>
Blow out fuel line with compressed air
<br>
Why:  Removes all the rust and stuff that could plug up a fuel filter.
<p>
Replace or remove fuel filter
<br>
Why: It may already be partially plugged
<p>
Clean carburetor with spray cleaner
<br>
Why: Removes any debris and varnish that could cause problems
<p>
Turn up idle good and high
<br>
Why: When a car hits hard, the fuel in the carburetor sloshes around and floods out the engine.  
<br>
With the idle up high, the car will keep running
<p>
Wire choke wide open
<br>
Why: When a car hits hard, the choke may slam shut, causing the engine to stall
<p>
<p>
<h3>
Cooling System
<h4>
<p>
Run a solid fan, instead of a clutch type fan
<br>
Why:  This will ensure that the fan runs all the time and will not stop if it comes into contact with the shroud
<p>
Flush radiator/engine
<br>
Why:  Promotes better coolant circulation
<p>
Leave the thermostat in just remove all the guts inside of it
<br>
Why:  If the thermostat locks up, the coolant will not circulate at all.  Removing the thermostat all together causes
<br>
the coolant to circulate too fast.
<p>
Weld radiator brackets/housing
<br>
Why:  Gives the radiator more protection
<p>
Remove battery bracket
<br>
Why: Excessive front end damage may cause to come in contact with the radiator
<p>
Cut hole in hood over radiator cap
<br>
Why: You can easily top off the radiator with coolant
<p>
Plug or loop the heater hoses 
<br>
Why: One less hose that might rupture
<p>
Duct tape radiator hoses
<br>
Why: Helps prevent ruptures
<p>
Unbolt radiator and use gas tank straps or wire to hold it in place
<br>
Why: Excessive frame damage may actually cause the radiator to be ripped in two
<p>
Secure the radiator overflow hose in the container or route it to the outside of the radiator
<br>
Why:  If the radiator overheats, you don't want the bypass hose to blow coolant into the aircleaner
<p>
<p>
Leave the airconditioning radiator in place.
<br>
Why: It helps protect the radiator from flying mud and rocks
<p>
<p>
<h3>
Interior
<h4>
<p>
Re-enforce drivers seat with chain, pipe or seat belt
<br>
Why:  Hard hits can sometimes break the back of the seat off
<p>
Remove dash and all wiring
<br>
Why: Prevents electrical shorts, fires and promotes easier driver access 
<p>
Remove headliner
<br>
Why: The less flammable material in the car, the better
<p>
Remove door upholstery (except driver's door - local rules)
<br>
Why: Bits of plastic may come loose and fly around the car
<p>
Lock door and remove doorlock stems 
<br>
Why: You want the doors to stay shut.  The doorlock stems tend to rip your pants when entering/exiting the car 
<p>
Remove outside door handles 
<br>
Why:  They may get knocked off by another car and hurt someone
<p>
Remove rear seat
<br>
Why:  It's a fire hazard.  It may come loose.  You're better off mounting your gas tank lower to the ground and on solid metal
<p>
Remove sun visors
<br>
Why:  Just another think that may come loose and poke your eye out
<p>
Remove carpet
<br>
Why:  Another fire hazard
<p>
<p>
<h3>
Engine
<h4>
<p>
Change Oil - use 1 quart Slick 50 (or equivalent)
<br>
Why: You want to most protection possible.  Friction causes heat.  Heat kills engines.
<p>
Install new/clean sparkplugs, distributor cap and wires.
<br>
Why: Lessens the chance of electrical problems.
<p>
Duct tape wires on distributor cap.
<br>
Why: Hard hits may actually knock the wires off of the distributor cap.
<p>
Cutoff exhaust pipe, flip manifolds if possible.
<br>
Why:  You can hear and tell how the engine is running.  Running the exhaust through the hood keeps heat away from the engine,
<p>
If you keep the exhaust in the stock location, make sure that you don't cut if off to short and it blows on the starter or transmission
<p>
Tie plug wires away from exhaust manifold.
<br>
Why:  Keeps them from burning or melting.
<p>
Weld or chain motor mounts.
<br>
Why:  If a motor mount breaks, the engine doesn't jump around under the hood.
<p>
Remove all unused vacuum lines.
<br>
Why:  Just something else in the way or could catch fire or go wrong.
<p>
Clean engine/transmission with gunk off.
<br>
Why:  Clean engines/transmissions dissipate heat better and are less likely to catch fire.
<p>
<p>
<h3>
Electrical
<h4>
<p>
Re-route battery cables to passenger side floorboards and mount battery securely there.
<br>
Why: This will keep the battery our of harms way.
<p>
Run all electrical cables through a section of heater/radiator hose where they pass through the floorboards.
<p>
<br>
Why:  Chaffing can cause electrical shorts and fires.
<p>
Run battery ground to intake manifold bolt.
<br>
Why: Promotes a better ground than the frame of the car.  The stock cable will usually reach the battery inside the car.
<p>
Cut hole in firewall behind distributor (if needed).
<br>
Why: Excessive front end damage can cause the distributor to contact the firewall and crack or break.
<p>
Wire up starter, coil and battery to toggle switches.
<br>
Why: The less electrical connections the better.  
<p>
<A HREF="wiring.jpg"> Here's a diagram on how to do the wiring</A>
<p>
Solder and use electrical tape on all connections.
<br>
Why: You want to secure all the connections and keep them from coming apart.
<p>
Remove all extra wiring.
<br>
Why:  It's more stuff that's in the way and could catch fire.
<p>
<p>
<h3>
Frame/Suspension
<h4>
<p>
Weld spider gears together.
<br>
Why:  Both tires will still turn when flat.  Promotes better traction and maneuverability.
<p>
Jack up car and stuff rags into shocks (repeat several times).
<br>
Why:  Makes the car sit up higher.
<p>
Loosen bumper mounting bolts and relocate bumper as high as possible.
<br>
Why: Protects the radiator better.
<p>
Replace bumper mounting bolts with grade 8 ones and large washers
<br>
Why:  Keeps the bumper from falling off
<p>
Wire or chain the bumper to the frame
<br>
Why:  Keeps the bumper from falling off
<br>
<p>
Drill holes in bumper shocks, compress, and weld in place (front and rear).
<br>
Why: Strenghthens them and keeps them from falling off.
<p>
Cutoff bumper ends and leave them good and sharp.
<br>
Why: Keeps you from getting stuck up on other cars.  You can use the sharp ends to puncture tires.
<p>
Notch frame behind real axle if car is a non-gm and has coil springs.
<br>
Why: The read end will bend up, instead of down.
<p>
Run chains through hood, in front of radiator, around bumper and back up (if allowed).
<br>
Why: Protects the radiator.
<p>
Remove the front sway bar if equipted.
<br>
Why:  Frontend damage may push it into the fan.
<p>
<h3>
Transmission
<h4>
<p>
Hook up threaded rod shifter.
<br>
Why:  The stock linkage is easily broken.
<p>
Chain or wire transmission to mount.
<br>
Why: Broken transmission mounts are not good. 
<p>
Change transmission fluid and filter after every derby.
<br>
Why: Transmissions get hot and burn the fluid and sometimes even melt the plastic filter.
<p>
Connect the 2 lines at the transmission using rubber transmission hose (not rubber gasline).
<br>
Why:  Rusty metal lines break or crack easily.
<p>
Grease/replace U-joints.
<br>
Why:  Broken u-joints are a show stopper.
<p>
