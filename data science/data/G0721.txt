<P>In a now-famous statement, at the end of his book &quot;The
First Three Minutes&quot;, the Nobel Prize-winning theoretical
physicist <!g><A HREF="../bio/wein-body.html">Steven Weinberg</a> wrote that &quot;the more the universe
seems comprehensible, the more it also seems pointless.&quot;
In effect Weinberg was claiming that science paints a picture
of our universe as a vast purposeless place in which we can see
no evidence of a point for ourselves as human beings. Weinberg's
statement was perhaps one of the coldest ever issued by a scientist,
and not surprisingly it annoyed many religious believers. For
Christians, and also for those of many other faiths, the universe
is inherently purposeful and humanity's role is central.</P>

ALT="Steven Weinberg" BORDER="0" ALIGN="RIGHT"></A>Needless to
say, religious believers have risen to the challenge. One Christian
who disputes Weinberg's view is <!g><A HREF="../bio/birch-body.html">Charles Birch</a>, an Australian biologist
who is one of the founders of the modern science of ecology. Birch
suggests that it is probably not surprising that Weinberg, as
a physicist, should come to such a cold hard view of the universe,
because he says physicists are &quot;used to looking at the world
in a very mechanist way&quot;. But where Weinberg sees a pointless
world, Birch reads the evidence in a very different way. In particular,
where Weinberg sees the universe from an impersonal perspective,
Birch sees himself as an inherent part of the universal system
that science describes. Looking at the universe from this personal
perspective, he says, &quot;I find meaning in it.&quot;</P>

<P>Likewise, Father <!g><A HREF="../bio/coyne-body.html">George Coyne</a> - a Jesuit priest and astronomer
who has spent his life studying the formation of stars - insists
that the universe is full of meaning and purposefulness. He points
out that for all science's great achievements it is not necessarily
the field which can show us the point of either our own lives
or of the universe as a whole. That task is outside science, he
says; instead it is to be found in our own experience as human
beings living in the world. As he explains: &quot;The whole of
human experience, I think, tells us that there is a point, that
there is meangingfulness to things. When I hold the hand of a
dying friend, and see the expression of hope and joy - even at
the moment of death - in that friend's eyes, I can see that there
is a meaningfulness to existence that goes beyond scientific investigation.&quot;</P>

BORDER="0"></A>Interestingly, Weinberg is much in agreement with
Father Coyne. Although he believes that science paints a picture
of a &quot;chilling, cold&quot; and pointless universe, he also
insists that we human beings can give the universe a purpose through
the way we live our lives - &quot;by loving each other by discovering
things about nature, by creating works or art.&quot; We may not
be the stars in any great cosmic drama, Weinberg says, but &quot;faced
with an unloving and impersonal universe&quot; we can nonetheless
create for ourselves &quot; a little island of warmth and love
and science and art.&quot; It is a deeply humane statement from
a man often associated with a cold, impersonal vision. What is
most surprising, perhaps, is that here an avowedly atheistic scientist
expresses a view not dissimilar to that of some religious believers.</P>
