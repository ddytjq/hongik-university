    25, 1999: </B>In <I>Julius Caesar</I> William Shakespeare wrote
    &quot;But I am constant as the Northern Star, of whose true and
    resting quality there is no fellow in the firmament.&quot; However,
    had he known about cosmology, he'd have probably chosen a better
    comparison than <I>Polaris</I>, which is actually a variable
    star. <BR>
<BR>
    Stars like <I>Polaris</I>, called Cepheid variables, have a wonderful
    property (wonderful to astronomers, that is). The rate at which
    they pulsate is simply related to their luminosity. So, by observing
    the apparent brightness of a Cepheid and its period of variability
    it is straightforward to estimate its distance. Because astronomers
    can measure the distance to Cepheids -- and, thus, to the galaxies
    they inhabit -- these peculiar stars hold the key to many important
    questions in Cosmology. <BR>
<BR>
    At <A HREF="ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/pressrel/1999/99-065.txt">today's
    NASA Space Science Update</A>, scientists announced that they
    had used the Hubble Space Telescope to study Cepheid variables
    and measure the expansion of the Universe with unprecedented
    precision. To fully grasp the meaning of these new measurements
    it may help to reflect on events 70 years ago, when a young American
    astronomer named Edwin Hubble was using the great telescopes
    of his day to study the large-scale structure of the Universe.
<BR>
<BR>
    In 1929 as Hubble pursued his studies of distant galaxies, he
    realized something extraordinary. Ten years earlier Shapley had
    noticed that other galaxies appeared to be flying away from our
    own Milky Way. Hubble had the insight to realize that not only
    were these objects apparently speeding away, but the farther
    away they were, the faster they appeared to be moving. Thus the
    Hubble Constant, H<sub>o</sub>, was born. H<sub>o</sub> is a
    number which relates a galaxy's apparent speed of recession to
    its distance from the Milky Way, as shown in the graph below.
<BR>
<BR>
    Scientists now know that the recessional velocites that we observe
    are not actually distant galaxies flying through space, all away
    from the Milky Way, but instead we are actually observing the
    expansion of the Universe itself (and everything in it).&nbsp;This
    expansion would look the same no matter what galaxy we actually
    inhabited, and is one of the visible pieces of evidence that
    points to a &quot;Big Bang&quot; origin for our Universe. <BR>

    The Hubble Constant describes how fast objects appear to be moving
    away from our galaxy as a function of distance. If you plot apparent
    recessional velocity against distance, as in the figure above,
    the Hubble Constant is simply the slope of a straight line through
    the data. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
    The Hubble Constant is usually expressed in units of &quot;kilometers
    per second, per Megaparsec.&quot;&nbsp;One parsec is a unit of
    distance equal to about 3.2 light years, and a Megaparsec is
    a million times this, or about 3.2 million light years.&nbsp;So
    what the Hubble Constant says is that for every 3.2 million light
    years you look out into space, the objects there appear to be
    receding from you at a rate of H<sub>o</sub> kilometers per second.&nbsp;If
    H<sub>o</sub> is 100, then the objects appear to recede at 100
    km/second for every 3.2 million light years you look out into
    space.&nbsp;If H<sub>o</sub> is 50, then you have to look about
    6.4 million light years out into space for the same 100 km/second
    recessional velocity.&nbsp;</P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="+2">B</FONT>ut how do astronomers measure H<sub>o</sub>
    in the absence of a cosmic &quot;radar gun&quot; and mile-markers?&nbsp;There
    are actually several ways, each with their own advantages, disadvantages,
    and sources of uncertainty.&nbsp;Some involve the study of supernovae
    with optical telescopes, others capitalize on a physical process
    in distant clusters of galaxies called the <A HREF="/newhome/headlines/ast22feb99_1.htm">Sunyaev-Zeldovich
    effect</A> that can be detected by combining X-ray images and
    microwave astronomy measurements. Another method, used by scientists
    working with the Hubble Space Telescope, for example, involves

    </TABLE>Cepheids (named as a group after the star delta-Cephei)
    have been known for quite awhile, and they exhibit a very regular
    fluctuation in their brightness on timescales of about 2 to 100
    days.&nbsp;<I>Polaris</I>, the &quot;North Star&quot; is indeed
    a member of this class of variables. It turns out that the frequency
    with which they change their brightness is directly related to
    the star's intrinsic luminosity.&nbsp;This so-called &quot;Period-luminosity
    relationship&quot; was discovered by Henrietta Levitt, an astronomer
    who worked at Harvard in the early decades of this century.&nbsp;</P>

    <P>For nearby Cepheids that can easily be resolved in ground-based
    telescopes, it is fairly easy to measure both the brightness
    and the period of the star.&nbsp;&nbsp;With these measurements
    in hand, by using the period-luminosity relationship, one can
    find the luminosity of the star.&nbsp;And since the luminosity
    and brightness are related by an inverse-square law, the distance
    to the star can be determined with a bit of simple 7th or 8th-grade
    algebra.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This works great for stars within our
    galaxy, and in some nearby galaxies like M31 (Andromeda) and
    M33.&nbsp;Indeed Hubble himself put the question of &quot;the
    realm of the nebulae&quot; to bed in 1923 by measuring Cepheids
    in these galaxies, and deducing a distance of about 900,000 light
    years.&nbsp;This distance was at least a factor of 20 or more
    farther than any object within our galaxy, showing that these
    nebulae were indeed galaxies in their own right, rather than
    collections of stars, gas, and dust within our own Milky Way.</P>

    <P>But on cosmological scales, 900,000 light years is the equivalent
    of a local phone call.&nbsp;At these nearby distances, the cosmological
    expansion proceeds very slowly (two dots near each other on the
    surface of the balloon experiment above hardly move with respect
    to one another) with velocities equal to or less than typical
    random motions of stars within the galaxy, more like the velocity
    of the Earth around the Sun, about 30 km/second or less.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
    Going deeper into space, where the expansion proceeds more rapidly,
    to look at individual Cepheids was a difficult task for most
    ground based telescopes.&nbsp;So until the Hubble Telescope came
    along, with its ability to resolve Cepheids in extremely distant
    galaxies, astronomers had to be a bit more resourceful in getting
    at the Hubble Constant.</P>

    <P>And resourceful they were.&nbsp;Using a variety of methods,
    many fraught with uncertainty and large systemtic errors, the
    answers have traditionally come out somewhere between 50 km/s/Mpc
    and 100 km/s/Mpc.&nbsp;And therein lies the rub.&nbsp;In this
    difference between 50 and 100 km/s/Mpc lies the fate of the entire
    Universe. <BR>

    <FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT>he fate of the Universe actually depends
    on four numbers, which have been described as the &quot;Holy
    Grail of Cosmology.&quot; Three of these numbers are independent,
    meaning if you find three, the fourth one can be computed from
    the three you know.&nbsp;&nbsp;Among these numbers is the Hubble
    Constant.</P>

    <P><IMG SRC="../images/button1.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> The first number is called the
    ``deceleration parameter,'' and it is a measure of how fast the
    cosmological expansion is speeding up or slowing down.&nbsp;Or,
    colloquially, does the Universe have it's foot on the gas or
    on the brake?&nbsp;Written by scientists as q<sub>o</sub> (&quot;q-naught&quot;),
    a positive value of the deceleration parameter means the universe
    is slowing down (foot on the brake), a value of 0 means the universe
    is expanding at a constant speed (coasting), and a negative value
    means that the universe is accelerating (foot on the gas).</P>

    <P><IMG SRC="../images/button2.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> The second number is the ``density
    parameter.''&nbsp;Called either `omega' or `sigma,' depending
    on the units one uses, this number describes how much &quot;stuff&quot;
    is in the universe. The larger the density parameter, the more
    stuff there is. Issues related to &quot;missing mass&quot; are
    often tied up in measurements of the density parameter that turn
    out to be smaller than one needs to theoretically halt the expansion,
    for example through the self-gravitation of all objects in the
    Universe.</P>

    <P><IMG SRC="../images/button3.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> The third number is simply the
    age of the universe.&nbsp;How old is this place?&nbsp;We can
    actually get a decent handle on lower-limits to this number simply
    by recognizing that the universe has to be older than the oldest
    objects in it.&nbsp;Radioactive isotope studies yield ages of
    at least nine to sixteen billion years for our Galaxy, and the
    ages of the oldest star clusters put the limit at about 14 billion
    years.&nbsp;Give or take a billion years, a reasonable lower
    limit to the age of the Universe turns out to be about 15 billion
    years.</P>

    <P><IMG SRC="../images/button4.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="30" HEIGHT="30" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> The fourth number is our Hubble
    Constant H<sub>o</sub>.&nbsp;Two other numbers that are often
    discussed in cosmology, the &quot;cosmological constant,&quot;
    which Einstein referred to as one of his greatest blunders, and
    the &quot;curvature of the Universe,&quot; are determined by
    the density parameter and the deceleration parameter. <BR>

    </TABLE>The way these numbers play together mathematically allows
    one to write the product of H<sub>o</sub> and the age of the
    universe as some function of the density parameter and the deceleration
    parameter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">(Age of the Universe) x (Hubble
    Constant) = A complicated function of&nbsp;the density and deceleration
    parameters</FONT></P>

    <P>In other words, given our fairly robust limit of the age of
    the Universe, and a reliable measurement of the Hubble Constant,
    their product restricts our Universe to only a very limited set
    of combinations of density parameter and deceleration parameter,
    many of which can be further ruled out by other independent observations.
    Conversely, if one assumes a cosmological model (i.e. values
    for sigma<sub>o</sub> and q<sub>o</sub>), a measure of the Hubble
    Constant can give you a measure of the age of the universe.</P>

    <P>Regardless of the approach, by getting a reliable measurement
    of the Hubble Constant, we therefore have a much greater understanding
    of the nature and eventual fate of the Universe.&nbsp;If the
    Hubble Constant is large enough, for example, for a given age
    of the Universe, the deceleration parameter must be negative,
    meaning that the Universe is not slowing down, but instead is
    accelerating its expansion.</P>

    <P>One can actually draw a &quot;map&quot; of where our Universe
    might be within the realm of all possibilities, to see these
    implications of a measurement of H<sub>o</sub>.&nbsp;Using the
    `sigma-q' notation, it looks something like the accompanying
    figure.</P>

    and rapidly accelerating, low-density universes are at the lower

    where the cosmological constant (lambda) is zero (sigma<sub>o</sub>
    = q<sub>o</sub>).&nbsp;Below this line, the cosmological constant

      </TR>
    </TABLE>The curves from upper left to lower right are the locus
    of points where the Hubble Constant times the age of the Universe
    equals some number, indicated on the line. For example, the Einstein-deSitter
    model located at the bold dot (sigma<sub>o</sub> = q<sub>o</sub>
    = 1/2) has a value of H<sub>o</sub> times the age of the universe
    equal to 2/3. By measuring the Hubble Constant and multiplying
    by the age of the Universe, we are restricted to live on one
    of these curves.</P>

    <P>We are somewhere on this diagram...but where?&nbsp;</P>

    <P>A value of H<sub>o</sub> = 70 km/second/Mpc in an Einstein-de
    Sitter Universe results in an age of the universe slightly less
    than 10 billion years, and with the uncertainty in H<sub>o</sub>,
    a value of about 12 billion years is likely not out of the question
    for this model.</P>

    <P>With an age of 15 billion years, consistent with the ages
    of the oldest star clusters [<A HREF="#ref">ref</A>],
    and a Hubble Constant measurement of 70 km/s/Mpc, one obtains
    a product of 1.07 (when the units are accounted correctly). This,
    combined with a strong theoretical impetus for a flat topology
    (k = 0), would confine our position to a narrow area in the lower
    left of the diagram, with a positive cosmological constant.&nbsp;</P>

    <P>It is indeed possible that our latest measurements of the
    Hubble Constant may have shown us that our universe is accelerating,
    and will continue to do so forever. Nature appears to have its
    foot on the cosmological gas pedal - and we're along for the
    ride.</TD>
