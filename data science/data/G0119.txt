<b> 3.1 Observations</b><p>

Thirty-one galaxies were observed with the 1.5 meter telescope (P60)
of Palomar Observatory on the night of 1991 May 4 with the Wide Field
Prime Focus Universal Extragalactic Instrument (Wide Field PFUEI).
The wide field camera has a 306 mm f/4 aerial camera lens collimator
and a Nikon 58 mm f/1.2 camera lens. The field of view is 16' x 16',
and it is projected on an 800 x 800 Texas Instruments (TI) CCD in the
Cassegrain focus, yielding a scale of 1.19 arcsec per pixel. The focal
ratio of the system is f/1.65.

Images were obtained in the <i>g</i>, <i>r</i>, and <i>i</i> bands of
the Thuan-Gunn photometric system. The original, 4-band system
(<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>g</i>, and <i>r</i>) was introduced by Thuan
and Gunn in 1976. It was later extended by Wade <i>et al.</i> with the
<i>i</i> band, and by Schneider <i>et al.</i> with the <i>z</i>
band. Most CCDs are not efficient in the <i>z</i> band, but <i>g</i>,
<i>r</i>, and <i>i</i> CCD surface photometry of galaxies have been
extensively done in the past decade. These filters are centered at
500nm, 650nm and 820nm, respectively.  The filters were placed in
front of the camera optics to avoid problems with reflection. The
system transmission functions are plotted on the right.

<p>

All exposures were 60 seconds. The 9 electron CCD readout noise was
low enough to allow such a short exposure time and still ensure that
the background was sky noise limited. The gain of the instrument is
about 2 electrons/ADU (analog-to-digital units).  The readout noise
was negligible.  Typical counts around the center of galaxies are
10,000-20,000 ADU.  Keeping the exposure time short for all the
observations made it possible to obtain more than 150 images
(including flats and standard star observations) in one night. The
centers of some of our brightest galaxies, however, are
saturated. Saturation was limited to only a few pixels around the
photometric center of these galaxies. We introduced a scheme to repair
these regions and to calibrate these galaxies.

<p>

Eighty-two galaxies were observed with the 1.1 meter telescope of the
Lowell Observatory on several nights between 1989 March 24 and April
4. A camera with a thinned, back-illuminated 320 x 512 pixel RCA CCD
was in the Cassegrain focus. A 2:1 focal reducer gave an f/4 focal
ratio, yielding a scale of 1.35 arcsec per pixel. The field of view was
about 7' x 11'.

We used the three-band <i>J</i> (sometimes designated as <i>B_J</i>),
<i>R</i> and <i>I</i> photometric system, which was developed to take
advantage of silicon CCDs. Only <i>J</i> and <i>R</i> images were
obtained of each galaxy. These filters are centered at 450nm and
650nm.  You will find a plot of the system transmission curves on the
right.  Typical exposure times were between 100 and 600 seconds,
depending on the galaxy core brightness.  Short test exposures were
first obtained of each galaxy in each filter in order to avoid nuclear
saturation. The readout noise of the CCD was 90 electron, and the gain
of the instrument was 11 electron/ADU.  Typical counts in central
regions of the galaxies reach above 10,000 ADU.

<p>
<a name="processing"></a>
&nbsp;<br>
<b> 3.2 Image processing</b><p>

Debiasing and flat fielding the images of galaxies observed at
Palomar were straightforward. We used the data in the extended
horizontal register of the CCD to obtain the bias level, which was
subtracted from the image. Twilight sky flats were obtained in all
three passbands during the night of observations. These were used to
create a median flat, which was used to flat field the images.

<p>

Besides subtracting the bias level, we had to use a more complicated
flattening procedure for the images observed at Lowell. Because of the
glass substrate of the RCA CCD, the night sky emission lines caused
Fabry-Perot fringing in the <i>R</i> band (<i>J</i> is not affected
since there are no strong atmospheric emission lines in this
band). Because of fringing, we treated the <i>R</i> and the <i>J</i>
images differently.  Another problem was that observations took place
in both bright and dark conditions, since the observing run was longer
than a week. The color of the background sky is close to the color of
the twilight flat in bright conditions, but is quite different when
the Moon is down. 

<p>

A few pixels around the photometric centers of some of the galaxies
observed at Palomar were saturated. Compared to the total area of the
fields, only a very small portion of the images were affected,
accounting for only a negligible part of the total light of the
galaxy. We modeled the light distribution around the photometric
centers with a seven-parameter, two dimensional Gaussian
distribution. First, to preserve integer representation of the images,
we divided all pixel values by 2 in the entire image if the center was
saturated; in no case did this compromise the sampling of the noise
histogram. Next, we used the information in the image just around the
saturated center to fit these parameters, and then replaced all
saturated pixels with analytical values from our fit.  Eleven of the
31 spiral galaxies observed at Palomar were saturated at the
photometric center, eight of them in all bands, three of them only in
two bands.

<p>

We used an empirical two dimensional point-spread-function (PSF) to
fit and remove the foreground stars from the images. The program we
developed for this purpose first identifies stars off the galaxy to be
used for constructing the PSF. Second, it finds those objects that
are likely to be foreground stars (versus HII regions, bright stars
belonging to the galaxy, etc.) and removes them by using a PSF fit. Third,
the residuals left in the image are repaired cosmetically. Although
the program does not perform all necessary steps automatically, it was
very useful for the purpose of cleaning these images.  Details of this
procedure are to be found in Frei: "<a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=J96-06231&db_key=AST&high=35a573dc3d26640">Semi-automatic
removal of foreground stars from images of galaxies</a>," in the
Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, vol. 108,
p. 624, 1996.

<p>

On several occasions the area occupied by the galaxy was much
smaller than the total area of the original image, so we chose to
extract square regions out of the original images that contained the
galaxy, thereby saving a considerable amount of storage space. The CCD
chip used at Lowell was not square, making it necessary to crop to
obtain square images. We decided to construct the catalog using
only square images of a few standard sizes. Offsets (the coordinates
of the lower left corner of the trimmed image in the original image)
and the coordinates of the photometric center of the galaxies in the
final clipped images were recorded in the FITS file headers.

<p>

We also calibrated all the galaxies photometrically, but not without
difficulty. Conditions during several nights of observations at
Lowell, and part of the observing night at Palomar, were
non-photometric. Moreover, observations of standard stars were not
available for all nights at Lowell. In Frei and Gunn: "<a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=A95-64002&db_key=AST&high=35a573dc3d26693">Generating
colors and k-corrections from existing catalog data</a>," in the
Astronomical Journal, vol. 108, p. 1476, 1994, we derived
transformation relations for colors of galaxies among five different
photometric systems. These were used to calculate magnitudes in the
given filter systems from data available in the Third Reference
Catalog of Bright Galaxies (RC3).  For those data from Palomar, both
the calculated magnitudes and the magnitudes obtained from
standard-star-calibrations are given in the FITS file headers (seven
standard stars were observed during the night of observations).  The
Lowell data contain only magnitudes calculated via color
transformations of the RC3 data.

<b> 3.3 Properties of galaxies in the catalog</b><p>

All of the galaxies in our catalog are listed in RC3.  We list the
most important parameters in the table below.  The first column is the
New Galaxy Catalog (NGC) number of the galaxy in our catalog.  The
second column identifies the source of the image (Palomar Observatory
or Lowell Observatory). The revised morphological type (T) on the
"Handbuch der Physik" system is listed next.  T=-5 for elliptical
galaxies, T=-3 for lenticular galaxies and T is between 0 and 9 for
spirals. T=10 and above describes irregular and peculiar
galaxies. Columns 4 and 5 are right ascensions and declinations as
recorded in the file headers at the time of observations. Columns 6 to
10 are the total <i>B_T</i> magnitudes, heliocentric mean radial
velocities (v), major axis isophotal diameters (D), inclination
angles, and position angles, respectively.

We recorded useful information in the header keys in the FITS files of
the images. There are several keys among those we used that are
standard FITS keys: SIMPLE BITPIX, NAXIS, NAXIS1, NAXIS2, BSCALE,
BZERO, BUNIT, OBJECT, DATE, DATE-OBS, INSTRUME, TELESCOP, OBSERVER,
HISTORY, CRVALn, CRPIXn, CDELTn, CTYPEn, DATAMAX, DATAMIN, and EQUINOX.
There are several keys that we added to describe the data as best as
we could. These are listed in the table below.

<p>

The first column contains the name of the header key, the second
column has the type of the variable, and the last column gives a short
description. The first six keys (EXPOSURE to TIME) were recorded
during the observations. We obtained PSF_FWHM from the data at the
time of foreground star removal, and SKY and SKYSIG at the time of
calibration.  The photometric zero-points DNAT0_ST and DNAT0_BV are
calculated from observations of standard stars (not available for the
Lowell data) and by using data from RC3, respectively. We recorded the
photometric center of the galaxy in the trimmed, square image
(G_CENT_X and G_CENT_Y). The parameter SATURATE is used to tell
whether the galaxy center was saturated and repaired. The last seven
header keys (B_RC3 to VELO_RC3) are populated with data from
RC3. These are well described in RC3 and in the previous section. We
gave the location (column and line) of the actual data entry in the
RC3 table.
