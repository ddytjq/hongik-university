<H3>What the NAPCM is About</H3>

<!--ICparagraph_text-->
<!--ICparagraph_text-->
<P>Founded by Mark Padgett, current jackman for the #55 Winston Cup team, the NAPCM is an organization recognizing the efforts of racing pit crew and team members and the contribution that they make to their field. It is a way for these athletes to address the issues that they face in their industry and come up with ideas to solve common problems faced by all racing pit crew and team members.  The NAPCM also provides these athletes the chance to keep up with the latest track and team news as well as a variety of information that they can use to constantly improve their performance.<BR><BR><a href="page607487.htm">WHO FOUNDED THE  NAPCM?</a><BR><BR>Everyone is talking about the NAPCM and for good reason!!  Every race fan, at some point, dreams of going over that wall or setting up that car on raceday.  Pit crew and team members live that dream but it is very hard work.  They sacrifice their personal lives, families and free time for the sport that they love.  That is why the NAPCM was founded.  To give these athletes the appreciation and credit that they deserve while keeping them updated about all aspects of their constantly changing field.<BR><BR>Above photograph courtesy of RacingDiva.com.</P>

<H3>Race City Resumes Hosts Race Team Softball League</H3>

<!--ICparagraph_text-->
<!--ICparagraph_text-->
<P>The Totally Racin' Softball League is an association of active NASCAR race team members, who play in an organized weekly series of softball events every Tuesday night at North Mecklenburg Park in Huntersville, North Carolina. <BR><BR>The Race City Resumes Totally Racing Softball League has been formed with NASCAR Winston Cup, Busch, and Truck race teams. League Founder Bob Hubner, first came up with the idea to form a league with race team employees in 1998 after watching his brother Rick play for the company he works for in Orlando, Florida. Bob thought it would be great to get everybody together for some fun away from the race track and shops. "It's a real blast, I enjoy every minute of it" says Hubner. "The best part is watching everybody getting along and having a great time doing something together besides working. It gives the guys back at the shops who don't go to the races each week a chance to get out and meet other people from other teams."  The NASCAR Softball League is comprised of NASCAR race team employees only.  Each player on each team works for that team they are playing for. <BR><BR><center><BR><a href="http://www.racecityresumes.com" target="_top">Visit Race City Resumes for Pit Crew Softball Information</a><BR><a><BR><BR>As a way to reward its' members the NAPCM is giving away $100 of free money.
