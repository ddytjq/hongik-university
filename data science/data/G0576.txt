<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The more involved I get with this topic, the more often I ask myself such questions as why did things turn out the way they did?   For example, if Theodor Kaluza suggested the feasibility of a fourth spatial dimension in the early 1920s, why was it not viewed as a theoretical confirmation of a four-dimensional Riemannian hypersphere, which was Einstein's personal favorite at the time?    When Edwin Hubble announced that the universe was expanding, why did the astronomical community embrace the open-flat-closed Friedmann models from the 1930s until fairly recently, when everything has been thrown up in the air, and no one knows for sure how it will come back down.   Why has the interest of extra-dimensional space sometimes waxed, sometimes waned during the twentieth century?
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The following links are chosen not only to show "where we are" but also "how and why did we got there".   The best history of the fourth spatial dimension in the early twnetieth century was written by an art professor, Linda D. Henderson, rather than a cosmologist, and so a link to her book (scheduled to be republished in 2003) appears near the end of this file.   Any discipline - art, math, physics, cosmology, even architecture - which contribututes to a better understanding of this still esoteric topic is fair game in this file.

  <li><a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/%7Ewright/cosmolog.htm">Cosmology
File</a> by Ned Wright.    Probably the best site for cosmology on the WEB.
  The latest headline news items are usually summarized at the start of this
file. 
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.sciam.com/1999/0499issue/0499weeks.html">Is Space Finite?</a>   This is an article written by Jean-Pierre Luminet, Glenn Starkman, and Jeffrey R. Weeks in the April 1999 issue of Scientific American.   It provides a good survey of the topic and 
mentions the current problems of the big bang model and why alternate cosmologies/topologies
are being pursued.    The fifth and sixth paragraphs discuss
the possibility that space in the universe might be "multiply-connected".   Then the next section in the article is entitled "Comfort in the Finite".    The Riemannian 4D
hypersphere mentioned here is the one which is analyzed in this series of
essays.   As you will see <a href="hubhor3.html">in Essay #3</a>, there
is an easy way to define the singularity which yields this "multiply-connected" model.

<Li><a href="http://xxx.lpthe.jussieu.fr/abs/gr-qc/0106033">Topological Lensing in Spherical Space</a> by Evelise Gaussman, Roland Lehoucq, Jean-Pierre Luminet, Jean-Philippe Uzan, and Jeffrey Weeks.   The "topological lensing" refers to the possibility of seeing the same object more than once - not necessarily in the opposite, or even the same, direction - and this unusual phenomenon is considered for virtually every known three-dimensional structure (some of them rather exotic).   There is a very good discussion of the model I'm interested in<strong>:</strong> the one in which a sperical surface is "embedded" in higher dimensional space.   The Introduction in particular is worth a look, and I refer to this article several times in the essays.
<p>
What the authors refer to as the Einstein - de Sitter universe, I call Riemannian space (or the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric).   There is sometimes a "lingo" problem in cosmology in that different names are used to refer to the same model, although there may be a subtle difference in the models I'm not aware of. 
</li>
<p>  
<li><a href="http://physicsweb.org/article/world/13/11/9/1">The search for extra dimensions</a> was written by Steven Abel and John March-Russell in the November 2000 issue of Physics World.   In the first ten paragraphs or so, it explains why a fourth spatial dimension allows Maxwell's equations governing electromagnetic radiation to be a specific solution of Einstein's theory of relativity.   The fourth paragraph mentions a "rotation" presumably around some axis<strong>;</strong> Einstein and Kaluza thought it was the axis of a cylinder.    It really has been an unanswered question for decades<strong>:</strong> in (or on) what type of structure does this "rotation" occur and what is its "size"? 
<p>
<li><a href="http://focus.aps.org/v4/st28.html">
An Invisible Dimension</a> is a summary in Physical Review Focus of an article written by Lisa Randall and Raman Sundrum proposing that the fourth
spatial dimension might not necessarily be "compactified".   Perhaps there
    <em>is</em> a way of looking for it, as Lisa and Raman suggest. </p>    
    <p> </li>
<li><a href="http://focus.aps.org/v9/st13.html">Ring Around the Singularity</A> is a synopsis of a more extensive article authored by R. Emparan and H. S. Reall in the fall of 2001 (with revision in the spring of 2002) and is available <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0110258">here</a>.   Notice the reference to a "large" fourth spatial dimension.
</li>
<p>
<li><a href="http://www.sciencewatch.com/may-june2001/sw_may-june2001_page3.htm">New Dimensions in Theoretical Physics</A> is an article in Science Watch about novel concepts by Savas Dimopoulos and his colleagues.   It's one of the better articles explaining why "extra dimensions" are necessary to explain gravitational anomalies in physics, and puts the previous Randall/Sundrum in better perspective.   There are two linked files, and when you scroll about halfway down the first file, you'll see a paragraph referring to the Kaluza/Klein idea of how one more spatial dimension - the fourth one - could unify gravity and electromagnetism.   Although tradition holds that a fourth spatial dimension exists in the way it is described in string theory, it's possible to derive a realistic cosmological model of the universe in which it exists as a "large" dimension, which is what I do <a href="condensed.html">here</A>.   
<p>
<li><a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/Paraphys/kal1x.htm">Up, Up, and Away.   The fifth dimension in physics.</a> by James E. Beicher.   This article is probably as close to a reprint of Kaluza'a original idea as there is on the internet at the moment.   Even though the mathematics is formidable - readily conceded by the author - the written text is usually easy to follow.  There are two linked files and the first 25% of the initial file on history is particularly good reading, as is the Conclusion in Part II.

<p>
<li><A href="http://www.fm/7-sphere/dual.htm">Seven Dimensional (and up) Einsteinian Hyperspheric Universe</A>.   This is an excellent site maintained by Sam Cox.   You should <em>definitely</em> read the short essay at this link.   If you compare the previous article with Sam's site you'll see certain similarities: a reference to higher dimensional "embeddedness" in the three spatial dimensions (and one time dimension) we know are there, plus the possibility of dual universes.   If one more dimension can unify gravity and electromagnetism, Sam suggests that two more (for a total of seven dimensions: six space, one time) might be the holy grail of modern physics: the "grand unified theory" (GUT), which provides a common explanation of gravity, electromagnetism, plus the large and small nuclear forces. 
<p>
But I'm going to limit my discussion to topology, because I'm primarily interested in deriving the most likely alternate global structure of the universe, just in case it's not the conventional "spherical" model.   Although it seems late in the game and perhaps even hopelessly outdated, I'm going to derive the topological model consistent with the original Kaluza/Klein suggestion back in the 1920s of one more spatial dimension, under the assumption that it exists as a (very) large, rather than a (very) small, dimension.

  <p>
<li><a href="http://tap3x.net/EMBTI/j6greene.html">A Conversation with
Physicist Brian Greene</a> is written by John Fudjack in September, 1999,
and has a interesting discussion of the alternate character of the fourth
spatial dimension - there are only two choices<strong>:</strong> very large
or very small - if it's there. &nbsp;&nbsp; (In the mid 90s Columbia physics
professor Brian Greene wrote <a href="http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~motl/universe/">
The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for
the Ultimate Theory</a>, a surprising bestseller.) &nbsp; In fact, there
are a few quotes from my "old" series of essays (which will still be there
for another month or two) in Fudjack's file. &nbsp; By my biased reckoning,
the most interesting part of the file begins when you scroll about one fourth
of the way down, beginning in Section Three. 
    <p> (Incidentally, there are two links to my site at this site.   The
first link is OK, but the quote from my Introduction has been revised slightly
in later editions.   The second link at the end of Fudjack's file is to my
old site which will  be shut down on of these days.)      </p>

  <li><u>Flatland</u> by Edwin Abbott.  This is the classic in the field,
a popular book in college courses, and a "must read" (not to mention a good
read) if you're interested in this topic.
<p>
I'm going to do you a favor<strong>:</strong> Here's the <a href="http://promo.net/pg/">Project Gutenberg</a>  Search Page.   Simply insert "Edwin Abbott" as the author or "Flatland"
the title in the Search Area, and you'll get two titles in the Gutenberg
files (one illustrated, one not).   On the same page you might want to click
on the "Browse" link as it will lead you to a file when you can search the
book inventory alphabetically by author or title.   The objective of the
Project Gutenberg is to add classic books (whose copyright has expired) that
can be downloaded for the user's convenience.    
    <p>
 (Incidentally there are probably half a dozen sites with the full
text of Edwin Abbott's  classic.   Just insert "flatland" in one of the search
engines - such as <a href="http://www.Google.com">Google</a> - and you'll
get other snazzier versions of Flatland than the two at the Gutenberg Project.)

<li><A HREF="http://members.aol.com/jebco1st/Paraphysics/hinton01.htm">Charles Hinton</A> was influenced by the English mathematician <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Clifford.html">William K. Clifford</A>, a mathematician who died in his 30s and who doubted that space in the universe was "homoloidal" (a fancy way of saying he didn't think that space in the universe could be properly described in Euclidean terms).   Hinton was the probably the mathematician in America most involved with the fourth spatial dimension at the turn of the nineteeenth into the twentieth century.   Hinton also gave us the term (still used) for a four-dimensonal cube<strong>:</strong> tesseract.   The four paragraphs of the Introduction are worth reading, and at the end it quotes Hinton as saying that we should use the fourth spatial dimension only if it's necessary, which is still good advice.

  <li><a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/7997">The Fourth Dimension</a>
 is a fine web page maintained by Eric Saltsman.   Nearly everything you
need to know about hypercubes and  hyperspheres is right here.   On the main
and FAQ pages there is a oblique reference  to what I call "embeddedness"
in Essays #1 and #2.   This is the idea that a 4D hypersphere is created
by "stacking" 3D spherical surfaces on top of one another.   (Its basis is
the  "derivative" in calculus and is explained at the start <a href="hierarchy(1).html">
of Essay #1</a>.) 
    <p> The recently added "message forum" at this site discusses many of
the questions usually asked about the fourth dimension, e.g., is it time
or is it space? </p>

  <li>Sten Odenwald maintains an excellent series of <a href="http://itss.raytheon.com/cafe/cosm/cosmol.html">

<li><a href="http://www.physicstoday.org/pt/vol-54/iss-12/p49.html">Einstein, Picasso: Space, Time, and the Beauty That Causes Havoc</a>.   This is a review of a book written last year by Arthur Miller which appeared in the December 2001 issue of Physics Today.   One wouldn't think that Einstein and Picasso would be the subject of a scholarly book, and this shows the strange twists and turns non-conventional geometry has taken over the years in both art and science.   The review gives the flavor of what was in "in the air" in the early part of the twentieth century.

<li>There are at least a few teachers who have written general
or college level texts on higher dimensions.    Check the home pages of the

      <li><a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/~banchoff/">Thomas Banchoff's
Home Page</a>, who is a professor at Brown University (RI).   If there is
one person who can lay claim to being the world's expert on the fourth spatial
dimension, he's it.

      </li>
      <li><a href="http://www.mathcs.sjsu.edu/faculty/rucker">Rudy Rucker's
Home Page</a>, who is now a professor at San Jose State University.   Back
in the 1970s while teaching in upstate New York, he wrote <em>Geometry, Relativity,
and the Fourth Dimension</em> which, since there are so few books published
on the subject, is still referred to quite often.   The biography mentions
this book, in addition to several other books, including a novel, <em>Spaceland</em>, which will describe what happens when a creature from the fourth dimension visits Joe Cube (who lives in just three dimensions), and is scheduled to come out in the summer of 2002.

      <li><a href="http://www.mkaku.org">Michio Kaku</a> is on the "compactified"
side of the ledger with respect to the fourth spatial dimension, and has
written several books, the most interesting one  in 1994 called "Hyperspace:
A Scientific Odyssey Through the Tenth Dimension".   If you click on the
"Hyperspace" link listed in the left column with other books <a href="http://www.mkaku.org/hyper_toe.htm">
(or this link)</a> and read the short description, you will see that Dr.
Kaku concedes that a fifth dimension might be there, and not necessarily
the way it's described in string theory.   As you may gather by browsing
around at this site, Dr. Kaku has done much to popularize the current revolution
in science.   </li>
<p>
<LI><A HREF="http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/fourth_fc.html">Surfing Through Hyperspace</A> by Clifford A. Pickover.   This site gives the preface of his book published in 1999 and it's an excellent overview of the topic.   Dr. Pickover writes<strong>:</strong> "Although the concept of the fourth spatial dimension is more than a century old, its strange consequences are still not widely known".   (This is same sentiment I expressed near the end <A HREF="index.html#einstein">of the Introduction</A>.)   I certainly admire how Dr. Pickover frames the subject and then tells you how he is going to discuss it.</li>

<li><A href="http://www.utexas.edu/cofa/a_ah/faculty/hendlin.html">The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art</A> by Linda Dalrymple Henderson.   I could write the copy, but Linda did a much better job than I could via an e-mail received on March 13, 2002: 
<p>
<font color=navy>
<blockquote>I wrote a book in 1983 on the centrality of interest in higher spatial
dimensions for early 20th-century artists--from the Cubists and Marcel
Duchamp to the Russian Suprematist Malevich and even Surrealists.   The
first chapter contains what is still perhaps the fullest history of the
early interest in the idea in the 19th century.  Michio Kaku, for example,
drew extensively on it in the art-related chapter of his book.  It has been
wonderful in recent years to see the resurgence of interest in this idea.
<p> 
MIT Press will reprint my book next year, with a long new intro. essay in
which I'm tracking the fate of the idea in popular culture, science, and
art from 1950 to 2000.  Obviously, the Web has made a huge difference in
the diffusion of related information.

Also, you might find <a href="http://www.weeklywire.com/ww/07-19-99/austin_books_feature1.html">this article</a> in The Austin Chronicle (July 19, 1999) a good elaboration of Linda's interest in this topic and how the book evolved. 
<p>
<li><a href="http://tonyrobbin.home.att.net/">Tony Robbin's Homepage</a>.   If you take the book link to"<em>fourfield</em><strong>:</strong> Computers, Art, & the 4th Dimension", you'll see that the Forward was written by Rudy Rucker and that the Introduction was contributed by Linda Henderson.   The 1992 copyright coincides with the resurging interest in the general topic.   You might want to check out the lecture link too.

<p>
<li><a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/generalscience/astrobizarre_fourD_010619.html">Astronomy Bizarre: The Fourth Dimension is Back</A> by J. Craig Wheeler.   Naturally I have an objection to the title; I don't think a fourth spatial dimension is "bizarre" at all.   If it <em>seems</em> bizarre, it's because we haven't been looking at things the right way.   This link was suggested by Linda Henderson (March 15, 2002), and she also mentioned: 
<blockquote>
<font color=navy>
I loved hearing Craig Wheeler say to his students about embeddedness, "I used to tell students that asking what the universe might be curved into was not a legitimate question, but now we're interested in that topic."  
</font>

<p>
The article mentions Tony Robbin's book (link directly above) and Arthur Miller's new book (link 13).
</li>
 
   </ol>
</ol>
The objectives is this series of essays is actually rather simple<strong>:</strong> (1) precisely what assumptions do we make for a large fourth dimension to exist in a way that  "embeddedness" works and (2) assuming that a spherical surface is "embedded" in higher dimensional space, what happens if we project that behavior out to, and even beyond, its opposite side?   In other words, might we be looking out far enough these days to notice the difference between conventional Euclidean space and another alternative?   If we are, what is that alternative?
