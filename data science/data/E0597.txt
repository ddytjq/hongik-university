<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">For those unfamiliar with Phil, he
wrote a great compression utility called PKARC.&nbsp; This program
was fully compatible with the System Enhancement Associates' (SEA's)
ARC program.&nbsp; (ARC was one of the first compression tools for
the DOS environment.&nbsp; What many now refer to as &quot;zipping a
file&quot; was, at that time, called &quot;arcing a file.&quot;)&nbsp;
Phil's PKARC differed significantly only in that it was much faster
and free.</P>
<P>Over time, Phil's free PKARC program largely displaced the
&quot;not-free&quot; ARC program.&nbsp; In one of the early examples
of a larger technology company using the courts to protect a poor
product against a smaller company with a superior product, SEA
proceeded to sue Phil.&nbsp; If I remember correctly, eventually Phil
was prohibited from writing programs that could read or write
ARC-formatted files.</P>
<P>Phil did not give up.&nbsp; He created the now ubiquitous ZIP
compression format.&nbsp; He placed the format, the compression
algorithms, and the ZIP extension into the public domain in 1989.&nbsp;
System operators quickly replaced virtually all ARC files with ZIP
files as a show of support for Phil.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Phil Katz passed away on April 14,
2000, at the age of 37.&nbsp; Personally, I think the world would be
a somewhat different place had Phil not given so freely.&nbsp; May he
rest in peace.</P>
