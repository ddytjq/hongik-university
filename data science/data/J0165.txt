      <H2>Part II of Aaron's 1997 LeMans trip</H2>

      <P><B>From: <A HREF="mailto:aaron@heimke.com">Aaron Heimke</A>
<BR>
      To: Travels with TrackSchedule.com - http://www.trackschedule.com</B></P>

      <P>After a longer delay than I planned, here is Part II:</P>

      <P>You will remember that we have arrived at the track, gotten
      the car into the campground, and are all setup. Thursday practice
      is underway, and we can hear the cars from the campground.</P>

      <P>Before we head over to the track, let's look around the campground
      a little bit. The campground is in the infield, behind the main
      grandstands. Right next to our spot is a berm that surrounds
      the dirt track that is part of the ACO club complex. Between
      us and the main stands, there is also a small paved road course
      that hosts various club races, DEs, etc. throughout the year.</P>

      <P>The camp ground is a bit primitive, but adequate. (My version
      of adequate may not match yours. Usually, when I go &quot;camping&quot;
      it is with my rich Uncle Sam. I often sleep on top of a M1A1
      Abrams Main Battle tank in whatever weather is occurring at the
      time. Having an actual tent with an air mattress is pretty luxurious
      by my standards.) The campground is grass, with gravel roads.
      Lots of trees keep things fairly shady and comfortable. There
      are 3 latrine buildings. They have male and female bathroom areas
      with toilets and sinks. There are also shower areas. (This is
      also more than I am used to, since I have often gone 2-3 weeks
      with no real showers in the service of our nation.) They are
      kept pretty clean by attendants, and when you go in for showers,
      etc.., bring change to pay the mandatory &quot;tip.&quot; These
      facilities are perfectly acceptable, in my opinion. There were
      lines in the mornings, but by waiting until later in the day,
      you can avoid the lines. There was also a little store that got
      fresh baked goods every morning. The croissants are better than
      any I have ever had outside of France. Get up early to get your
      stuff though, because they sell out pretty quickly. This campground
      is filled mostly with Brits, and I saw lots of very expensive
      cars. It is a bit strange to see a nice, later model Porsche
      Turbo or Ferrari something or another next to a tent in a campground.
      I was most envious of a guy and his 6 or 7 year old son who had
      driven to the race in his Carrera. They had a small 2 man tent
      and some basic camping gear. Just enough to live on. They looked
      to be having a grand time!</P>

      <P>There is at least one other campground that I know of. It
      is over near the Maison Blanc, and was primarily filled with
      large motor homes. It is nice groomed grass and paved roads.
      More ritzy, but surely more expensive. I was able to tag along
      with Jerry and the rest of the PCA crowd, sharing the cost of
      the spot we had 6 or 8 ways. I think my portion was $20 or 30.
      In my opinion, this is the way to really experience LeMans. Once
      you park the car, you just walk everywhere. It is very convenient.
      I could come and go whenever, without messing with the car. If
      I went back to the campground, and someone had a good place to
      go or something good to do, I could just turn around and head
      right out. If I were in a hotel somewhere, it would be very hard
      to be as flexible. Keep in mind that LeMans is a big party atmosphere,
      and only very diehard fans will constantly watch the race. Having
      a base of operations and a safe place to keep things made it
      great. If I wanted to watch a couple of hours of the race, I
      could grab my folding chair and head out. Then, if I wanted to
      go to the village (More on this later), I could go drop off the
      chair and then head back without having to keep lugging the chair
      around. At our spot, we could see one of the &quot;Jumbo-Tron&quot;
      TV screens, so if we happened to be in our campground when something
      exciting happened, we would hear it on Radio LeMans and see it
      on the screen. I have heard they have added even more of these
      screens, which will increase the areas you can see then from.
      Another point: Since LeMans is a big party atmosphere, alcohol
      is consumed. It was great not to have to worry about driving
      to a hotel. I plan to camp again for 2000, and I think I can
      get a tent, a mattress, a cooker, and some munchies in an air
      freight container, which I will check onto the airplane. Once
      I hit Paris, I will get down to the track and get linked up with
      the PCA folks (I hope) again.</P>

      <P>OK, enough logistics. Thursday is a practice day, and the
      track is filled with lots of cars. If I remember right, you don't
      need tickets for the practice day. Even if you do, they are cheap.
      The hot tip is to buy the weekend general admission ticket. You
      get a discount if you join the ACO at the same time. Again, in
      the interest of economy, I didn't buy reserved seating. There
      is enough open areas in front of the stands opposite the pits
      that you can squeeze in, even at the start and finish. Once the
      race is underway, there is plenty of room to bring a folding
      chair and set up for a good long stay. The amount of time spent
      actually sitting in the reserved seats don't seem to make them
      a very good buy. If any of them would be worth it, it MIGHT be
      the ones above the pits. I went up there on Friday, just to look
      around. Nice seats in the shade with a good view, but you can't
      really see into the pits because of the skyboxes, which are right
      above the pits. Everyone recommended against buying these reserved
      seats, and I didn't miss having them at all. It is much more
      fun to move from place to place around the track. You get to
      see the cars doing many more things.</P>

      <P>On Thursday, the cars practice most of the day until around
      dinner time. Everyone takes a break, and gets ready for night
      practice. Sunset comes about 10 PM, and then there is a few hours
      of night practice. It is really cool to see the cars in the dark.
      They have various ways to show their numbers at night, ranging
      from strategic spotlighting to really cool neon numbers in the
      side windows. The Porsche GT2s and GT3s looked the best, since
      these neon lights fit nicely in the quarter windows. Brake discs
      glow, turbos shoot fire and the headlights bore holes in the
      night. Tres Cool!</P>

      <P>Friday dawns crisp, clear and silent. Friday is the final
      prep day and tension starts to build. The pits are open, and
      you can walk around among the transporters and watch everyone
      work on the cars from 10 feet away. The way these teams are organized
      is incredible! In my life with Uncle Sam's Traveling Circus,
      it was my job to organize lots of men and equipment, and transport
      them across great distances to accomplish a specific task. These
      guys were doing pretty much the same thing, but they take the
      organization and planning to a high science. I spent lots of
      time looking and watching, and these guys have got it down. I'd
      love to be a team manger for one of these slick operations!</P>

      <P>After cruising the pits from one end to the other, front and
      back, we headed over to the museum. This is a very good museum
      that covers the entire history of the LeMans race, plus a large
      amount of information about the French automobile industry. (I
      still don't understand why French cars are so ugly! ;-)) We spent
      a couple of hours in the museum. There was a bus tour of the
      track available, but it was kind of pricey, so we skipped that.
      We went looking around the vendor areas along the back side of
      the old grandstands. I literally bumped into that famous Porsche
      fan Jerry Seinfeld in the crowd. I am not the type who would
      walk 10 feet to ask a celebrity for an autograph, so it didn't
      really click who it was. One of the guys I was with recognized
      him, and wanted to get his autograph. I hung back, and he went
      to bug him. Jerry nicely, but firmly, declined, and we moved
      on. If I had some tickets to the PCA BBQ, I might have invited
      him over. We saw him a couple more times in various parts of
      the track during the whole weekend. He was obviously just there
      to have a good time and watch the race.</P>

      <P>We spent the rest of the day walking around the track scouting
      good viewing spots for the race. We checked out the carnival
      (same as anywhere else in the world) and the village. The village
      has lots of shops and stands. The famous Grand Marinier crepe
      stand is here. <B>You have not really been to LeMans unless you
      have a Grand Marinier crepe!</B> After getting our crepe, we
      move on through the village. All of the major vendors (tire,
      oil, etc.) are there, as well as several of the specialty manufacturers.
      Nissan and Porsche had their GT1 street cars there, and Panoz
      also had a stand. There were 3 or 4 sports cars from companies
      I never heard of - essentially glorified kit cars. You can also
      get stuff from all of the race teams and manufacturers. Porsche
      was there with the full line of goodies and souvenirs. Lots of
      neat stuff in the village. I made several visits during the weekend.</P>

      <P>Whew, it has been a long day with lots of walking. Time to
      head back to help get set up for the PCA Germany Region BlowOut
      BBQ. In years prior to 1997, this was a big event with lots of
      people. Jerry and the rest of the PCA officers decided to tone
      it down a little because of the logistics of getting everything
      to France. For 1997, the big event, Porsche Clubwise, was Porsche
      Club Great Britain's bash. They had it catered, and it was nice
      (I was a traitor and snuck over for a short while) but the crowd
      was a bit snooty. Back to the PCA party.</P>

      <P>We stayed up late eating and drinking and talking too much,
      and I was very glad that I only had to travel 25 feet to my bed!</P>

      <P>Good Night, see you in the morning.</P>

      <P>Saturday is Race Day!<BR>
