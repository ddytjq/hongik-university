            <p>Interest rates may vary which could affect repayments. Rates correct as at 14th November 2001. Typical example:
              A Flexible Repayment Mortgage of &pound;50,000 over 18 years and 7 months at an interest rate of 5.95% (<span class="contenttextbold">typical
              APR 6.2% variable</span>) gives 223 monthly repayments commencing at &pound;324.73 in the first year with repayments
              increased thereafter by 1.95% each year giving 12 repayments of &pound;331.06, &pound;337.51, &pound;344.09,
              &pound;350.79, &pound;357.63, &pound;364.60, &pound;371.70, &pound;378.94, &pound;386.32, &pound;393.85, &pound;401.53,

              &pound;459.61 and 1 final repayment of &pound;269.21. The total amount repayable of &pound;86,086.79 includes

              based on the lower of the purchase price or valuation. For loans of 90% or more Mortgage Guarantee Insurance
              is required. Loans of more than 75% of the lower of purchase price or valuation may require a professional valuation
              and an additional fee.</p>
            <p class="contenttextbold">Flexible Repay Facility and Rapid Repay Facility </p>
            <p>Written quotations are available on request. All loans are subject 
              to status and applicants must be 18 or over. Security is required.</p>
            <p>For <b>Clydesdale Bank Flexible Repay</b> the minimum gross income 
              required is &pound;25,000 single or &pound;35,000 joint income. 
              For <b>Clydesdale Bank Flexible Repay</b> and <b>Clydesdale Bank 
              Rapid Repay</b> the minimum loan amount is &pound;40,000. These 
              Facilities are not available for business purposes.</p>
            <p>The savings which you are able to make are based on comparing our 
              <b>Clydesdale Bank Rapid Repay/Clydesdale Bank Flexible Repay</b> 
              to our Standard Repayment Home Loan of the same amount. For example, 
              if you had a <b>Clydesdale Bank Rapid Repay/Clydesdale Bank Flexible 
              Repay</b> of &pound;50,000 and you paid &pound;1,500 into your account 
              each month and spent &pound;1,000 at even intervals throughout the 
              month, you would have a surplus of &pound;500 in the account to 
              reduce your outstanding loan amount and cover any debit interest 
              due. By leaving this amount each month you could pay off your mortgage 
              13 years and 9 months early and save &pound;23,792 in interest.</p>
            <p>Interest rates may vary which could affect repayments. Rates correct 
              as at 23rd April 2002. Typical example: for a <b>Clydesdale Bank 
              Rapid Repay/Clydesdale Bank Flexible Repay</b> of &pound;50,000 
              over 11 years and 3 months if you paid &pound;1,500 into your current 
              account each month and spent &pound;1,000 at even intervals throughout 
              the month you will pay 5.24% <b>(APR 5.4% variable)</b>. The APR 
              includes an arrangement fee of &pound;200, legal fees estimated 
              to be &pound;176, professional valuation estimated at &pound;150, 
              a CHAPS fee of &pound;22.50 and a security release fee of &pound;75. 
              The maximum loan is 90% of the value of the property for <b>Clydesdale 
              Bank Rapid Repay</b> and 80% for <b>Clydesdale Bank Flexible Repay</b>, 
              based on the lower of the purchase price or valuation. Loans more 
              than 75% of the lower of purchase price or valuation may require 
              a professional valuation and an additional fee. You will be paid 
              credit interest if the balance of your current account and <b>Clydesdale 
              Bank Rapid Repay/ Clydesdale Bank Flexible Repay</b> is in credit 
              - please refer to the Personal Banking Tariff Guide.</p>
            <p>With <b>Clydesdale Bank Rapid Repay</b> and <b>Clydesdale Bank 
              Flexible Repay</b> there is no fixed repayment amount or repayment 
              frequency. You have complete flexibility to pay in additional sums 
              and withdraw sums so long as you ensure that the Limit is not exceeded. 
              With the <b>Clydesdale Bank Rapid Repay</b> the Safety Limit reduces 
              until the loan is fully repaid and can be over any term up to 25 
              years. The Safety Limit is based on what would otherwise have been 
              the balance of our 25 year Standard Repayment Home Loan. With <b>Clydesdale 
              Bank Flexible Repay</b> the Limit remains unchanged for the term 
              of your loan. You must repay the whole balance of the loan outstanding 
              at the end of the term from your own resources.</p>
            <p>With <b>Clydesdale Bank Rapid Repay</b> and <b>Clydesdale Bank 
              Flexible Repay</b> it is a requirement that the principal borrower's 
              salary must be paid into the account.</p>

              Scheme established under the Financial Services and Markets Act 
              2000. In respect of credit balances with a UK office, payments under 
              the Scheme are limited to 100% of the first &pound;2,000 of a depositor's 
              total credit balances with the bank and 90% of the next &pound;33,000, 
              resulting in a maximum payment of &pound;31,700. Most depositors, 
              including individuals and small firms, are covered. The Scheme covers 
              deposits made with the offices of the bank within the European Economic 
              Area and deposits denominated in all currencies are treated alike. 
              Further details of the Scheme are available on request. </p>

              Mortgage of &pound;50,000 over 25 years at an interest rate of 5.75% 
              (<span class="contenttextbold">typical APR 6.1% variable</span>) 
              fixed for 2 years with repayments thereafter charged at the standard 
              variable rate, which is currently 5.95% gives 300 monthly repayments 
              commencing at &pound;316.44 thereafter increased to &pound;322.13.

              end of the Fixed Rate period customers will be able to swap into 
              another home loan product (including Flexible Repay) without having 
              to pay an arrangement fee (a booking fee is payable if another fixed
