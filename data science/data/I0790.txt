West Ham's Teenage Star On Making The Grade, The Pressures On Him And Why The Irons Got His Signature...<p>


 You're getting a reputation as a bit of a prodigy, aren't you?<br> 
"I suppose so, but football is all I know; I was never any good at anything else. I hate to think what would have happened to me if I hadn't made it. I guess I was like most kids. I desperately wanted to make it as a footballer and dreamed about it all the time. The only difference between me and millions of kids is that I really felt I had the ability to make it. I never doubted myself, even at an early age."<p> 


You made it to the FA's school of excellence. How tough was that?<br> 
"The difficult thing was getting in there in the first place. I got used to being away from home and all that and I knew that, if I was going to make it, I would have to go through that anyway. Sometimes I missed home, but I had to be professional, it was all for my own good. I was far more interested in proving myself."<p> 


Nobody else seemed to doubt you either. There were loads of clubs after you, weren't there?<br> 
"There were a few. Most of the London clubs wanted to sign me and two or three of the bigger clubs up north. I enjoyed looking at most of them but, after going to West Ham, it was always difficult to look at anyone else. Everything was so nice. It's a great family club and they made me feel more welcome than most. After I signed at 11, I never looked back. I think I made the right decision. Look at the players they've brought through; guys like Rio Ferdinand and Frank Lampard. And there are plenty more where they came from, people like Manny Omoyimni and Lee Hodges. I reckon West Ham are going to have an even better side in the future than they have now."<p> 


You've now made the first team. How did that feel?<br> 
"I was a bit nervous, but it didn't have anything to do with the football. There was a lot of hype about me playing and that didn't help. I'd prefer to be left alone and just play football. I've never claimed I was this great player or anything; it's people outside who've put a lot of pressure on me and I don't think that's fair. I've not achieved anything in football yet and who knows whether I ever will? But I like to stay level-headed. That's why my mates are important to me. I'm just Joe to them, nothing else. They don't put me under pressure, they don't expect things from me. It's a good environment for me to be in. They keep my feet on the ground."<p>


You don't want hero worship, then. But do have any heroes yourself?<br> 
"Not really. I mean, there are certain players I like - Michael Owen, David Beckham, Paul Gascoigne - but I don't look to be like them. I try to take everything that is good out of a player's game and add it to mine."<p> <!-- text below generated by server.
