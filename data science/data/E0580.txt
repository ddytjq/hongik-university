<center><h2>Section 7.1: Declaring a Class</h2></center>
<p> 
Once you have designed your objects, writing the C++ code is
simple.  The hard part is designing objects that will interact well
with each other, that will do everything you need them to be able to
do, but nothing more.  There is almost no new syntax you need to learn
to write objects in C++.  It involves using the syntax for variables
and functions, so make sure you understand this syntax before
continuing.
</p>

<p>
Let's continue to flesh out our text-based adventure game.  First,
we'll write the code for our <code>Player</code> object.  In Chapter
6.1, we decided that players would have the following attributes, or
member data: health, strength, agility, type of weapon, and type of
armor.  To simplify this example, we'll just use the first three
attributes.  We also wanted the <code>Player</code> to have the
following actions, or member functions: move, attack monster, and get
treasure.
</p>


<p>

To write the code for our object, all we need to do is declare the
member data and member functions, and wrap them up inside an object
declaration.  Here's how it's done:

<pre>
class Player {
  int health;
  int strength;
  int agility;

  void move();
  void attackMonster();
  void getTreasure();
};
</pre>


This is a completely valid, working class declaration for the
<code>Player</code> object.  All we did was declared our member data
(variables for our object) and member functions (functions that our
object can use), and enclosed them inside a <i>class declaration
block</i>.  The class declaration block consists of the keyword
<i>class</i>, followed by the name of the object, in this case
<code>Player</code>, a pair of braces, and a semi-colon.
</p>

<p>

Of course, this object won't be able to do anything, because we
haven't <i>defined</i> its member functions.  Inside the class
declaration, we said that the <code>Player</code> object would be able
to do things like move, attack monsters, and get treasures; but we did
not say how a <code>Player</code> would execute these functions.  We
need to write a function body for each function, so that a
<code>Player</code> instance knows how to attack a monster, for
example.
</p>

<p>

Here's the syntax for writing a function <i>definition</i> for a member function:

<pre>
void Player::move() {
  //function body goes here
}

</pre>

In other words, it's almost identical to writing a function definition
for a plain-old, stand-alone function.  The only difference is that we
precede the name of the function, in this case <code>move()</code>,
with the name of the object, <code>Player</code>, and two colons.
This tells the compiler that this function is part of the
<code>Player</code> class.
