        <b>
        <p class="body"><font size="3">The Scheme</font></p>
        <p class="body">Introduction</p>
        </b>
        <p class="body">All UK building societies are participants in the
        Financial Services Compensation Scheme established under Part XV of the
        Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The Scheme is administered by
        the Financial Services Compensation Scheme Limited (FSCS), a body
        established by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). The Scheme is
        governed by FSA Rules.</p>
        <b>
        <p class="body">Activation of the Scheme</p>
        </b>
        <p class="body">Before the Scheme can be activated, the FSA or a court
        must make a determination about a building society participant in the
        Scheme. This would usually happen if it was determined that a
        participant was unable to repay investments which were due and payable.
        An example of where this might happen is if there had been a winding-up
        order in insolvency proceedings.</p>
        <b>
        <p class="body">Amount of Protection</p>
        </b>
        <p class="body">Under the Scheme, payments are limited to a maximum of
        £31,700, that is 100% of the first £2,000 of an investor's total
        shares and/or deposits in a building society and 90% of the next
        £33,000. The payment is calculated by reference to all the investor's
        protected shares with, and deposits in, the society. Therefore, for
        example, if a claimant had two separate accounts with the society, one
        containing £2,000 and the other £1,500, he or she would receive
        £3,350 (100% of the first £2,000 and 90% of the next £1,500).</p>
        <b>
        <p class="body">Protected Currencies</p>
        </b>
        <p class="body">Most shares or deposits with a building society are held
        in pounds sterling, but all other currencies are also covered.</p>
        <b>
        <p class="body">Interest on an Account</p>
        </b>
        <p class="body">Interest earned on accounts at the time the shares or
        deposits become due and payable is covered by the Scheme (within the
        limit of the maximum payment). If a winding-up order against a society
        has been made by the Court, interest will immediately stop being paid on
        the society's accounts.</p>
        <b>
        <p class="body">Shares and Deposits which are Protected</p>
        </b>
        <p class="body">All building society shares and deposits are protected
        by the Scheme except -</p>
        <p class="body">(i) a bond issued by a building society which is part of
        its capital (for example subordinated debt);</p>
        <p class="body">(ii) a secured deposit;</p>
        <p class="body">(iii) a deferred share issued by a building society
        (usually permanent interest bearing shares);</p>
        <p class="body">(iv) a non-nominative deposit (that is, a deposit made
        without disclosing the depositor's identity).</p>
        <b>
        <p class="body">Investors who are Protected</p>
        </b>
        <p class="body">Most investors are protected including individuals and
        small firms, but there are some exceptions, such as larger companies and
        government bodies.</p>
        <b>
        <p class="body">Joint Accounts</p>
        </b>
        <p class="body">In the case of a joint account each joint owner is
        treated as having a claim for his or her share, and unless there is
        evidence about their respective shares, they will each be regarded as
        entitled to an equal share. For example, if two people have a protected
        investment of £70,000 the maximum compensation to each would be
        £31,700, which would usually mean a maximum total payment of £63,400.</p>
        <b>
        <p class="body">Partnerships</p>
        </b>
        <p class="body">If two or more persons have a joint beneficial claim,
        the claim is to be treated as the claim of the partnership if they are
        carrying on business together in partnership. Otherwise the joint
        account rules (above) apply.</p>
        <b>
        <p class="body">Trustees</p>
        </b>
        <p class="body">If a claimant's claim also includes a claim as a
        trustee, his or her claim as trustee will be treated as being separate
        from the claim in his or her own right. If the same person claims as
        trustee for different trusts, these will be treated as claims of
        different claimants. If a group of people claim as trustees their claim
        will be treated as that of a single person. If the claimant has a claim
        as a bare trustee for one or more beneficiaries, the beneficiary or
        beneficiaries will be treated as having the claim. There are further rules relating to
        trustees.</p>
        <b>
        <p class="body">Personal Representatives</p>
        </b>
        <p class="body">Where a person numbers among his or her claims a claim
        as a personal representative of someone who has died, the claimant will
        be treated in respect of that claim as if he or her were standing in the
        shoes of that other person.</p>
        <b>
        <p class="body">Agents</p>
        </b>
        <p class="body">If a claimant has a claim as agent for one or more
        principals, the principal or principals will be treated as having the
        claim.</p>
        <b>
        <p class="body">Funding the Scheme</p>
        </b>
        <p class="body">The cost of the FSCS in respect of savings and deposits
        in building societies, banks and others, and the cost of compensation
        payments under the Scheme, is funded by contributions from the
        businesses, that are covered by the Scheme (including building
        societies, banks and others).</p>

        <p class="body"><font size="3">Making a claim under the scheme</font></p>
        </b>
        <p class="body">The Rules of the Scheme require a claim to be brought to
        the FSCS within a set time (normally within six years of the date on
        which the claim occurred). In practice, a building society would give to
        the FSCS a list of the names and addresses of the investors who may be
        able to claim under the Scheme. The FSCS would then send a claim form to
        each investor for completion. Full details of how to complete the form
        would be provided at the time.</p>
        <p class="body">Each claim would need to be verified before payment
        could be made. This could involve further questions being asked of those
        who have claimed and the FSCS asking the liquidator or administrator to
        confirm the amount of the investment on which the claim is based and to
        confirm that the claim does not relate to shares or deposits of a type
        that are not covered by the Scheme. Again, detailed procedures would
        normally be notified at the time.</p>
        <p class="body">Claims would be paid as soon as practicable (subject to
        the checking procedure) once the share or deposit became due and
        payable. In liquidation, that share or deposit would become due and
        payable on the date that the final winding-up order is made - in all
        other cases it would continue to its original maturity date. Payments
        would be made, normally by cheque in the currency of the account in
        which the share or deposit was held.</p>
