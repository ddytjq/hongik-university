DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- Dale Jarrett came from the 15th starting position to capture the
18th annual Busch Clash, the second of three major events at
Daytona International Speedway leading up to next Sunday's Daytona 500. 
<p>
Jarrett ran well in both 10-lap segments of the unique sprint
race for the previous season's pole winners, racing from 12th to
second -- just behind Marlin -- in the first half, then coming from
the back row in the inverted second-half start win the event.
<p>
&quot;It kind of opened up for me,&quot; Jarrett said. &quot;Everyone wanted to
follow Earnhardt and I took the inside. I'm happy as I can be to
win this.&quot; 
<p>
During the final five laps of the race, Jarrett was absolutely
dominant. As Sterling Marlin, Ken Schrader and Dale Earnhardt
battled each other for a shot at the lead, Jarrett stayed cool,
taking the center line through the 31-degree banks at Daytona. 
<p>
Jarrett won the race averaging 184.995 miles per hour, beating
Marlin by 0.19 seconds. Jarrett took home $62,500. 
<p>
Marlin, who has won the last two Daytona 500s, ultimately showed
the impressive speed that has led to his emergence as a top
superspeedway driver the past two years by drafting right behind
Jarrett. The two cars immediately pulled away from the field and
crossed the finish line one and two. 
<p>
&quot;We had a ball. I just wished we'd done one better,&quot; said
Marlin, who beat Jarrett in the first 10-lap segment. &quot;It's just
another day at the office, I guess.&quot; 
<p>
Earnhardt was strong but couldn't muster the muscle to overcome
the speed of Jarrett and Marlin. 
<p>
&quot;All the Chevrolets were racing each other and let that Ford get
out in front,&quot; said Earnhardt, the seven-time Winston Cup
champion who won his first pole-position for the Daytona 500
Saturday. 
<p>
Jeff Gordon, making his first appearance as the defending
Winston Cup champion, finished ninth. 
<p>
&quot;This race you only want to win,&quot; said Gordon.  &quot;Ninth doesn't
mean anything different than second or third.&quot; 
<p>
The field consisted of Busch Pole Award winners from 1995 and a
wild card entry. Gordon led all drivers last year, sitting on
the pole eight times, followed by Martin with four and Earnhardt
with three. 
<p>
The Busch Clash is a pair of 10-lap races, in which the starting
order is determined by a draw. The second race inverted the
starting order of the field from the first race. 
<p>
It is the middle event, sandwiched between the IMSA 24 Hours of
Daytona and the NASCAR Daytona 500 during Speedweeks '96. The
Daytona 500 kicks off the 31-event NASCAR season next Sunday at
2 pm EST.
