              I'm having an Achilles problem. I've tried to run through it and 
              finesse it. It's not a killer injury, but it means I haven't done 
              speedwork. Going into a race without having done speedwork makes 
              me very nervous. I ran the Azalea Trail 10k two weeks ago. There 
              and at another 10k this year, I ran 34 minutes; I was happy with 
              those. But I haven't done any speed since February. Tomorrow, I'm 
              just going to shoot for 59 minutes. [The next day, Rodgers ran the 
              first six miles on pace to break 57:00, then stepped off the course 
              because of his injury. After sitting in a bus for about 10 minutes 
              and telling himself he had never dropped out of a race that's not 
              a marathon, he got back on the course and jogged to the finish in 
              1:14:03.] </font></p>

              Like anyone else, I base it on my training and my earlier races. 
              But I know I'm not in my best shape. My racing right now is not 
              the top priority for me, for more personal reasons in my life. It 
              always means something to me --running means a great deal to me 
              -- but the racing side&#133;If you're injured, you need to take 
              care of that, and you lose the focus on your racing. I trained hard 
              this winter. I did a 20-miler, some 18-milers on the Boston course. 
              I got to a high of 87 or 89 miles. I did a 15-miler last weekend 
              and awww, my foot started to hurt!</font></p>

              They don't care how fast I run. It's a matter of pride for me. But 
              you're right, the race directors don't care. Here at the Nortel 
              Networks Cherry Blossom, they said you're welcome to run any pace 
              you choose. Sometimes I run relays. That's what I'll be doing at 
              the Oklahoma City Marathon, Flying Pig and probably also the Silicon 
              Valley Marathon in October. They auction me off to other people 
              who want to be on my team. I'm supposed to bring great speed to 
              the team. Little do they know I'm not quite as fast as Fita Bayesa 
              or Haile Gebrselassie! But they don't care, it's for fun and encouragement. 
              But usually I run my relay legs pretty hard, you know? I use them 
              as tune-ups for other races.</font></p>

              I don't have a shoe deal. There aren't too many endorsements available 
              for any runners, no matter what your age. I still work with John 
              Hancock and the Boston Marathon. Financially I do well, I'm happy 
              with it. I haven't missed being with a shoe company in the sense 
              that I don't have to bust my butt for them. I think I did more for 
              shoe companies in terms of daily labor than any other road racing 
              athlete. I also like the option of picking out my own racing shoes. 
              But I would be interested in working with one if something good 
              came up.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Other than 
              that, little things come along. I got asked to talk to a law firm 
              for an hour about the Chase Corporate Challenge. I think, &quot;This 
              is cool, I'll take your money.&quot; And of course I do stuff for 
              free, for charity organizations in Boston. But I still have to make 
              a living, and a lot of people don't understand that and don't offer 
              me much money. I had one company that wanted me to come in and work 
              for four hours at a marathon expo and they didn't offer me very 
              much, and I sorta vetoed it. It's kinda frustrating. On the other 
              hand, I know there are many runners who really struggle and are 
              in poverty where I was, and that's part of our sport.</font></p>

              the word out to the American running public on fundraising for top 
              up-and-coming post-collegiate American distance runners. Ryan has 
              talked about putting a letter in <i>Runner's World</i>, <i>Running

              runners can help our international representatives, the people who 
              are really struggling to stay in the sport. You know, tell how to 
              use some of the money we raised through these different organizations, 
              whether it's races like the New York City Marathon or other races.

              races going to a hospital or some other charity?</font></font></p>

              I think you can do both. Other events raise money for charity and 
              worthwhile causes. These are our Olympians, our international representatives, 
              and it's such a high-impact sport, so to have Americans in the mix 
              leads to more excitement about a race. But also I think we want 
              to support our international representatives. Maybe a lot of beginners 
              don't feel that connection, but over time, they come to see how 
              the sport is so good for them, and they see that these athletes 
              are not only good athletes but good representatives in their communities 
              and internationally, that they're very well educated and have a 
              deep love for the sport.</font></p>

              They can be motivators to other runners. Just like in other sports, 
              they can play a key role in motivating people to stay focused on 
              what their goals are. They can look to our top runners and learn 
              from them about how they became a better runner, how they conquered 
              injuries or became fitter and got more out of life, how they have 
              this program that they make part of their life. In other words, 
              they can emulate these runners; they can do the same thing. Hopefully 
              it's feeling a little bit of connection, an emotional connection. 
              People have emotional connections to people they see in big stadiums 
              that they never get close to, and yet you might be on the starting 
              line with our top Americans.</font></p>

              <font color="#003366">You've said how when you were at your best, 
              it was different because there weren't tons of altitude-born athletes 
              at every race, and that how things are now make it hard for Americans. 
              At the same time, you ran 2:09 at Boston twice. If you ran 2:09 
              at Boston last year, you would have won. Someone playing devil's 
              advocate could say, &quot;Well, why can't these guys at least run 
              2:09? It's not like people are running so much faster than 20, 25 
              years ago.&quot; So why is the onslaught of Kenyans an impediment 
              to American success?</font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366"><b>BR:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
              I don't think it's really an impediment. The Kenyans are a good 
              focus for our top runners to emulate. Their programs are good programs 
              that we are now applying -- group training in a kind of isolated 
              environment where you can really focus for a period of time and 
              help each other, push each other. This is the way to do it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I would like 
              to see some of the races do a better job of offering incentives 
              to Americans. It's encouraging to see what the New York City Marathon 
              is doing, with a separate purse for the Americans. I'd like to see 
              that at Boston, at Chicago and all the big races, because it's important 
              to help these people stay in there. You can do almost any job in 
              America and make more than a distance runner. These young up-and-coming 
              runners, they're extremely idealistic, they're running for these 
              dreams, it's almost like a movie. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But it's such 
              a demanding occupation to be a distance runner. You can't really 
              work and make much money otherwise, so they often struggle financially, 
              and if there's no chance to make much money on the roads because 
              it might go to altitude-born athletes, that's pretty tough. On the 
              other hand, I love the international-born athletes, what they bring 
              to our sport. I love our sport representing itself that way to our 
              country. I believe in international sport; I think we have too much 
              focus on domestic sports like baseball, football.</font></p>

              They're all memorable, but winning in '75 was the most memorable, 
              the one that had the most impact on my life. That first one was 
              where I got invitations to go to other races and where I suddenly 
              realized&#133;I knew I could run faster than I had the year before, 
              because I had won the bronze medal in the world cross country the 
              month before, and I felt pretty damn good in that race. It was not 
              a tough race for me except at the very last 700-800 meters, because 
              I didn't have enough fast-twitch fibers. If I had those&#133;I wasn't 
              really tired -- I went out the next day and did a two-hour run. 
              I wasn't beat up, I just didn't have the speed. So from that race, 
              I kinda sensed I had really improved.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I didn't have 
              much else in my life at the time. I was poor, I was in grad school, 
              I was a little nervous about becoming a teacher. My real passion 
              was running, and suddenly I was a top runner, and there was even 
              a little money coming in, which further encouraged me. It wasn't 
              much money, but it gave me encouragement, and that's why I think 
              today&#133;I was here at the elite athlete room --actually, I don't 
              like that word &quot;elite&quot; -- I was in the international athlete 
              room, and I saw these runners looking at the prize money chart and 
              showing each other how much money was there. For Americans it's 
              not a lot of money, but for someone from a Third World economy, 
              it is a lot of money. They're just as excited as heck to be checking 
              out the money. I don't think the average runners are aware of that, 
              and neither is the sports media, even the media that covers our 
              sport. They're not aware of how much of a focus, a driving force 
              that is for these runners.</font></p>

              Yes. People thought I was on drugs! But there were no drugs in those 
              days. The world record then was 2:08:34, Ian Thompson had run 2:09:12, 
              Ron Hill had done 2:09, so back then, that made me the fourth fastest 
              in the world. I was very, very stunned, really psyched. But I thought 
              I would go faster. I went to Fukuoka that December and ran 2:11. 
              Actually, my first marathon after winning Boston was a DNF in Holland, 
              on a hot day in May. That's when I came up with the term, &quot;The 
              marathon can humble you,&quot; which is now on a shirt that we sell 
              in our store. My brother did that to kind of remind me.</font></p>

              I felt very competitive. After world cross country, there was a 
              major, major change, a breakthrough. I was duking it out with the 
              best runners in the world there and beat all of them except two 
              people. Right behind me was John Walker. Still you can't translate 
              that to a marathon. I think that's the neat thing about the marathon, 
              is that it's always kind of a toss-up. A lot depends on the weather. 
              Fortunately, we had a very good weather day -- I like cool weather 
              -- but I knew I could duke it out with most of the runners there, 
              like Jerome Drayton from Canada and the Mexicans. As it turned out, 
              Steve Hoag from the U.S. took second in 2:11 that day. So we did 
              have good Americans, some real marathoners.</font></p>

              Yes. We've seen it over the years. I can think of some very, very 
              fine 10k runners who tried to move to the marathon but they were 
              really tired from training so hard for the 10k for six, eight, ten 
              years, that by the time they tried the marathon, their heart wasn't 
              in it, their body was real tired. I think some of the runners thought, 
              &quot;I'll make some money here.&quot; They think the marathon is 
              easier than the 10K -- you know, that whole thing about road racing 
              being easier than the track. Then they find there are a hell of 
              a lot of very, very fine marathoners running for that money. The 
              marathon is a different breed of cat. It's not like the 10k.</font></p>
