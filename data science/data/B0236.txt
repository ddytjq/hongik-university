  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>NEW APPLICATION HIGH PERCENTAGE LOAN FEE: </b></font>
  This is charged when
  a mortgage loaan represents 85% or more of the
  purchase price or valuation, whichever is the lower. The
  charge is made because of the generally higher level of risk
  involved in loans 85% or more of the property’s
  valuation. The fee is calculated based upon the amount
  lent above the 75% level. It is added to your loan and is paid off
  within your monthly mortgage payment over the term of the mortgage.

  <font size=1>e.g. Valuation: £40,000. Mortgage advance: £38,000 = 95%
  <br>
  75% level = £30,000. The loan fee would be 8.75% of £8,000
  <br>
  (£38,000-£30,000) = £700.00
  <br>
  Note: The minimum fee applicable is £145.
  </font>
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>NEW APPLICATION ADMINISTRATION AND VALUATION FEES: </b></font>
  These fees go
  towards the Society’s administrative costs when
  processing a mortgage application and the sum
  payable to the Valuer for the preparation of a basic
  valuation report. More detailed reports on the condition
  and value of a property can be arranged, if required,
  based on a fuller inspection. For the cost involved in
  arranging such a report, please contact the Society. The
  fees are payable at the time an application is made.

  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>SPECIAL ADMINISTRATION FEES: </b></font>
  Special administration fees apply on the following loans which are
  charged in addition to the valuation fee. The fee is payable
  when the mortgage application is made.

  Fixed Rate and Capped Rate Loan Fees are dependent upon
  the particular issue on offer.
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>SOLICITORS FEES: </b></font>
  When mortgaging a property the
  services of a solicitor are required and you will be responsible
  for meeting all the costs. In order to establish the fees involved
  you will need to speak to your chosen firm of solicitors.
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>C.H.A.P.S. PAYMENT FEE: </b></font>
  Usually on completion
  of a loan, we issue the monies to the solicitor by cheque for
  which no charge is made. However, if we are requested to
  transfer the funds using the Clearing House Automated
  Payment System, a fee of £25.00 is charged for each transfer.
  The charge is deducted from the completion amount.
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>FURTHER LOANS</b></font>
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>ADMINISTRATION FEE: </b></font>
  A fee of £50.00 is charged
  to cover the administration involved in a further loan
  and is debited to the mortgage account on completion.
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>HIGH PERCENTAGE LOAN FEE: </b></font>
  When a further loan takes the total mortgage to 85% or more of the
  property’s value, a High Percentage Loan Fee becomes
  applicable. The scale is identical to that appearing under the
  New Application section, with the fee being charged on the
  total amount of your mortgage debt over the 75% level. A
  rebate against this fee may apply, however, if your mortgage
  is under 4 years old and you paid a High Percentage Loan
  Fee at the time of the original loan. The minimum fee
  applicable is £105.00. When a fee applies it is added to your
  further loan and paid off within your monthly mortgage payment over
  the term of the loan.
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>MORTGAGE ADMINISTRATION</b></font>
  <br>
  In the normal course of events, no charges apply to the
  operation of your mortgage account. However fees are
  payable in the following circumstances:
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>UNPAID DIRECT DEBIT: </b></font>

  charged and debited to the mortgage account. Similarly, a recalled
  Standing Order Payment will attract a fee of £20.00.
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>RETURNED CHEQUE: </b></font>
  If our Bankers have to return
  a cheque unpaid, a fee of £20.00 is charged and debited to
  the mortgage account.
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>LENDERS REFERENCE: </b></font>
  When we are asked to
  provide a reference to another lender in support of our
  borrower applying for a new mortgage, we charge a fee of
  £25.00. The fee is usually paid by the lender at the time of the
  request, who may then seek payment from the borrower.
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>SECOND MORTGAGE QUESTIONNAIRE: </b></font>
  When we are requested to provide account information
  to another lender in support of our borrower applying for
  a further loan, we charge a fee of £50.00 per questionnaire.
  The fee is usually paid at the time of the application by the
  other lender who will seek repayment from the borrower.
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>DUPLICATE MORTGAGE STATEMENTS: </b></font>
  We provide an annual mortgage statement in January each year
  detailing the transactions on your account. Should you require
  a duplicate, this is available on request, subject to a fee of
  £25.00 which will be debited to your mortgage account.
  <br><br>

  to cover the administrative cost of loaning out Property Title
  Deeds (for disputes, sales, etc.). The fee is debited to the
  mortgage account.
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>TITLE DEEDS - SAFE CUSTODY: </b></font>
  When a mortgage
  account has been repaid, we can offer a safe custody facility
  for the title deeds. We charge a one off fee of £50.00 which
  must be paid when the arrangements are made. This fee can
  be refunded after 5 years provided the past borrower
  maintains full buildings insurance with us.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>TITLE DEEDS - PHOTOCOPIES: </b></font>
  Requests for photocopies of Title Deeds documents will incur a charge
  0f £15.00.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>REDEMPTION FEE: </b></font>
  A fee of £50 is payable when mortgages are repaid. This fee
  covers the preparation of documents for discharge and sealing, together
  with the updating of the Society's records upon closure
  of your account. The fee is payable on final payment of the loan.
  <br>
  <font size=1>
  See also the section below on Early Repayment Charges which may apply.
  </font>
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>EARLY REDEMPTION CHARGES: </b></font>
  If your mortgage is
  arranged under a special scheme, an early repayment charge may
  apply if the mortgage is paid off during the early years. In
  such a case, the mortgage offer will give the terms of the
  early repayment charge, but if you are in any doubt as to how it is
  applied please contact the Society. Part redemptions during
  the early years on special schemes may also incur an
  early repayment charge and again, if so, the details will be
  specified in the mortgage offer.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>ARREARS CORRESPONDENCE CHARGES: </b></font>
  When payments are missed
  we will send borrowers up to 3 reminder letters without any
  charge being made. After these we will charge a fee of
  £20.00 per reminder, debited to the mortgage account.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>ARREARS ADMINISTRATION FEE: </b></font>
  We will charge £50.00 if we instruct our Solicitors to take legal
  action in connection with arrears outstanding on your account.
  In addition we will debit your account with charges made by the Society's 
  Solicitor for acting on the Society's behalf. The level of these fees
  will depend on the nature and extent of the proceedings taken by the Society.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>POSSESSION ADMINISTRATION FEE: </b></font>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS</b></font>
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>CHEQUE CLEARANCE: </b></font>
  Under normal circumstances we
  require 9 working days, including the days of receipt and withdrawal,

  stopped, we charge a fee of £7.00 per cheque. This is payable
  before the stop can be placed with our bankers.
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>DEBIT INTEREST: </b></font>
  The Society is not able to allow
  overdrafts or overdrawn balances on investment accounts. If
  these should arise for any reason, debit interest will be charged
  at the current rate of interest until the account balance is
  restored to credit. Debit interest arises when the amount of
  penalty or debit interest on a transaction exceeds the credit
  interest earned in any given interest period. Outstanding debit
  interest will be deducted from the capital balance at the next
  interest payment date or date of account closure, whichever
  occurs first.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>GENERAL NOTES</b></font>
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>DATA PROTECTION ACT: </b></font>
  Every customer has the right
  to see their personal data held on our files. However, a fee of
  £5.00 will be charged each time this information is requested,
  to meet the cost of administration.
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>CHANGES IN FEES: </b></font>
  All the charges and fees discussed
  are subject to change at the discretion of the Society. However,
  when changes are made, we will print new advisory literature
  which will be available in all Branch and Agency offices.
  Furthermore a copy of the revised Charges and Fees leaflet
  will then be sent to you shortly after the year end along
  with your mortgage statement.
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>THE MORTGAGE CODE AND THE BANKING CODE</b></font>
  <br>
  Barnsley Building Society subscribes to both of the above Codes
  which set standards of good Mortgage Lending and Banking
  practice. Copies of The Codes are held at the Head Office of
  the Society and its branches and will be given out on request.
  <br><br>
  
  Under the Mortgage Code the Society offers three levels of
  service to all customers dealing direct with the Society to help
  them choose a mortgage, these being:-
  <ol>
    <li>Advice and recommendation as to which of our mortgage products is most suitable for you based on your particular requirements.
    <li>Information on the range of mortgage products we offer.
    <li>Information on a particular mortgage product from our range, if you have made up your mind already.
  </ol>
  
  We can provide information on the particular mortgage chosen
  to customers applying to the Society through a mortgage
  intermediary.
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>MUTUALITY STATEMENT</b></font>
  <br>
  As the world of finance changes and some building societies are choosing to relinquish
  mutuality and become banks, we wish to make clear the position of the Barnsley
  Building Society.
  <br><br>
  
  We are firmly committed to continuing as an independent mutual society for the sole
  benefit of our members. We remain loyal to the first principle of our founders, who in
  1853 stated as the Society’s objectives:-
  <br><br>
  
  "To enable persons to purchase their own residences or other freehold or leasehold
  property, to pay off mortgages or invest money profitably."
  <br><br>
  
  Although lifestyles have changed over the years we believe that the Barnsley Building
  Society, as an independent and profitable Society, continues to give its members
  benefits which only mutuality can offer - keenly priced, affordable mortgages and
  secure investment opportunities.
  <br><br>
  
  We would like to thank our existing members for their support over the years and trust
  that we maybe of continued assistance to family and friends in the years to come.
  <br><br>

  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>"OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU"</b></font>
  <br>
  At the Bamsley Building Society we maintain our commitment to
  ensuring that our customers are kept fully informed about all our
  products and services, including their relevant charges and fees. We
  believe that up-to-date information is essential to allow our customers
  to make valued decisions regarding their financial
  affairs. All charges and fees which are currently in force are
  contained on this page.
