Title:  The Norwegian Polio Study 1994: a nation-wide survey of problems in
long-standing poliomyelitis.<p>
Source Spinal Cord.  36(4):280-4, 1998 Apr.<p>
Abstract:  'The Norwegian Polio Study 1994' was performed to make a nation-wide
survey of the medical and social situation, and of the needs of anterior
poliomyelitis (polio). A questionnaire, consisting of 133 questions with
sub-questions, was sent to a total of 2392 polio victims, most of them
registered in 'The National Society of Polio Victims' in Norway. 1449 persons
(61%) answered. Sixty-six per cent were between 45 and 64 years of age, 25%
were above 64 years and 9% were under 45 years. When specifying new health
problems, 85% stated that they had experienced increased weakness in muscles
affected by polio, while 58% had experienced increased weakness in previous
non-affected muscles. Other health problems related to polio were fatigue
during exercise (80%), general fatigue (57%), joint pain (58%), muscular pain
(58%) and cold intolerance (62%). The participants indicated an increasing need
of aids, but 80% were still independent of help from others and 57% were still
employed, fully or part time. Only 17% were satisfied with the public health
services for polio survivors, while 67% of those who had undergone
comprehensive examination at some central hospital were satisfied. This study
indicates an obvious need of building up expertise in multidisciplinary
evaluation and treatment of post polio problems in countries where acute polio
has been eliminated. <p>

Abstract:  OBJECTIVE: To determine if the chronic pain frequently presented by
postpolio patients can be relieved by application of magnetic fields applied
directly over an identified pain trigger point. DESIGN: Double-blind randomized
clinical trial. SETTING: The postpolio clinic of a large rehabilitation
hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty patients with diagnosed postpolio syndrome who
reported muscular or arthritic-like pain. INTERVENTION: Application of active
or placebo 300 to 500 Gauss magnetic devices to the affected area for 45
minutes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Score on the McGill Pain Questionnaire. RESULTS:
Patients who received the active device experienced an average pain score
decrease of 4.4 +/- 3.1 (p &lt; .0001) on a 10-point scale. Those with the
placebo devices experienced a decrease of 1.1 +/- 1.6 points (p &lt; .005). The
proportion of patients in the active-device group who reported a pain score
decrease greater than the average placebo effect was 76%, compared with 19% in
the placebo-device group (p &lt; .0001). CONCLUSIONS: The application of a
device delivering static magnetic fields of 300 to 500 Gauss over a pain
trigger point results in significant and prompt relief of pain in postpolio
subjects. <p>

Title:  Normal postexercise facilitation and depression of motor evoked
potentials in postpolio patients.<p>
Source Muscle &amp; Nerve.  21(7):948-50, 1998 Jul.<p>
Abstract:  We studied the effects of exercise on motor evoked potentials (MEPs)
elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation in healthy subjects and postpolio
patients. Subjects performed repeated sets of isometric exercise until the
muscle fatigued. In both groups, the mean MEP amplitude immediately after each
exercise set was approximately twice that of the baseline amplitude, indicating
similar postexercise facilitation, and after fatigue was approximately half
that of the baseline amplitude, indicating similar postexercise depression. We
conclude that the intracortical component of central fatigue is normal in
postpolio patients. <p>

Title:  Motor unit size estimation of enlarged motor units with surface
electromyography.<p>
Source Muscle &amp; Nerve.  21(7):878-86, 1998 Jul.<p>
Abstract:  Surface EMG is hardly used to estimate motor unit (MU)
characteristics, while its non-invasiveness is less stressful for patients and
allows multi-electrode recordings to investigate different sites of the muscle
and MU. The present study compares motor unit potentials (MUPs) obtained with
surface EMG and macro EMG during voluntary contraction of the biceps brachii
muscle of patients with enlarged MUs caused by prior poliomyelitis. Averaged
surface MUPs were obtained by means of needle EMG (SMUP1) and surface EMG
(SMUP2) triggering. The MUPs area and peak amplitudes correlated well when
comparing the macro MUP and SMUP1 of the same MUs. When MU populations of
different patients were compared, the SMUP1s and SMUP2s were equally sensitive
to pathology as macro MUPs. In this, the late non-propagating positive wave
(only present in unipolar recordings) is more robust than the triphasic
propagating wave. Therefore, surface EMG can be used for detecting enlarged
MUs. <p>

Title:  New laryngeal muscle weakness in post-polio syndrome.<p>
Source Laryngoscope.  108(5):732-4, 1998 May.<p>
Abstract:  The authors describe the clinical presentations of post-polio
laryngeal muscle weakness in three patients with prior polio infection who
presented with new complaints including slowly progressive dyspnea, dysphagia,
and/or hoarseness. Evaluations by laryngeal videostroboscopy and
electromyography revealed vocal cord abductor and/or adductor weakness,
recurrent posterior glottic web in one case, and, in the two patients who
agreed to electromyography, evidence of prior denervation and reinnervation in
laryngeal muscles. Treatment was directed at attempting to maintain an airway
and optimize vocal quality. One patient benefitted from tracheostomy, one
benefitted from vocal cord medialization, and one benefitted from resection of
interarytenoid scarring. The authors conclude that diagnosis of laryngeal
post-polio syndrome is facilitated by laryngeal electromyography. Interventions
directed at maintaining an appropriate airway and optimizing vocal quality may
be helpful. <p>

Title:  Assessment Instrument for Problem-focused Coping. Reliability test of
APC. Part 1.<p>
Source Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences.  12(1):18-24, 1998.<p>
Abstract:  A new self-report instrument, the Assessment Instrument of
Problem-focused Coping (APC) developed from qualitative interviews, is
described. This instrument provides knowledge of the patients' own competence
in coping with activities of daily living (ADL), the patients' own assessment
of what they experience as problems, and the extent to which they are satisfied
with their ADL. The purpose of the study was to test the reliability of the
instrument with regard to intra-rater reliability and internal consistency. The
study group comprised 40 patients with muscular weakness and other symptoms
relating to the postpolio syndrome. The result showed an acceptable internal
consistency (alpha 0.70), which confirms the construct validity of the
instrument. The test-retest showed that the stability over a period of time
varied from low to high for a total of 28 items. At the same time, it is
evident that the instrument does not achieve the aim of being a good evaluation
instrument, because the stability over a period of time was unsatisfactory. The
test-retest should be repeated with a larger test group in future research
projects. <p>

Source Annals of Neurology.  43(5):661-4, 1998 May.<p>
Abstract:  We studied sleep architecture and sleep apnea pattern in patients
with postpolio syndrome (PPS). Ten patients with clinical signs of PPS
underwent polysomnographic recording for two consecutive nights. Although sleep
efficiency and proportions of sleep stages were within the normal range, sleep
architecture was disrupted owing to sleep apnea. Patients with bulbar
involvement had more frequent sleep apnea (mean sleep apnea index, 11.09) than
patients without (apnea index, 5.88). The former also had significantly more
central apnea, which occurred more commonly during non-rapid-eye-movement
(NREM) than rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, than those without bulbar signs.
This finding suggests reduction in forebrain control of compromised bulbar
respiratory centers during NREM sleep in PPS. <p>

Abstract:  Muscle computed tomography (CT) and muscle strength assessment of

muscle weakness showed significantly more CT scan abnormalities as compared
with the stable postpolio patients. No other features discriminative of
symptomatic postpolio patients were found. In individual patients, muscle CT
scan evaluation is a useful adjunct to muscle strength assessment. <p>

Title:  "Postpolio" sequelae and sleep-related disordered breathing.<p>
Source Mayo Clinic Proceedings.  73(3):216-24, 1998 Mar.<p>
Abstract:  OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical manifestations and various types
of sleep-related disordered breathing (SRDB) in patients with a history of
poliomyelitis and with current "postpolio" sequelae (PPS). MATERIAL AND METHOD:
We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 108 consecutive patients
with PPS and sleep disturbances encountered during an 11-year period at Mayo
Clinic Rochester and abstracted the features of acute polio, PPS, and results
of sleep evaluation (overnight oximetry or polysomnography). Only those
patients who were not receiving ventilatory support were included in the study.
RESULTS: The features of PPS were dyspnea, fatigue, new weakness, and
musculoskeletal pain. Of the 108 patients, 35 fulfilled the inclusion criteria.
Sleep evaluations revealed three general types of disturbances: obstructive
sleep apnea (group O, N = 19); hypoventilation (group H, N = 7); and both
(group OH, N = 9). The mean apnea/hypopnea index was 37, 4, and 16 per hour in
patients in groups O, H, and OH, respectively (P &lt; 0.05), and the mean
arterial carbon dioxide tension was 39, 60, and 55 mm Hg in these respective
study groups (P &lt; 0.05). The overall mean age at onset of symptoms of SRDB
was 47 years, and the mean latent period after acute polio was 37 years.
Hypersomnolence was the commonest SRDB symptom, present in 32 of the 35
patients. Snoring was noted in 100% of patients in group O, 0% in group H, and
67% in group OH. Patients in group O were obese and had normal lung function.
Patients in group H tended to have normal weights and a history of diffuse
neurologic deficits involving the trunk during the acute episode of polio.
Scoliosis, restricted lung function, cor pulmonale, and decreased maximal
respiratory pressures were common in patients in group H. Patients in group OH
had overlapping features of those in groups O and H. CONCLUSION: In patients
with PPS, we identified three patterns of sleep disturbances--obstructive sleep
apnea, hypoventilation, and a combination of both. These groups are
characterized by clinical features and by results of arterial blood gas
determinations, overnight oximetry, and polysomnography. SRDB is a late sequela
of poliomyelitis, and clinical evaluation should include information about
sleep. <p>

Title:  Neuromuscular ventilatory insufficiency: effect of home mechanical
ventilator use v oxygen therapy on pneumonia and hospitalization rates.<p>
Source American Journal of Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation.  77(1):8-19,
1998 Jan-Feb.<p>
Abstract:  The purpose of this study was to determine rates of pneumonia and
hospitalization for patients receiving oxygen therapy, patients having
indwelling tracheostomy tubes, and those using tracheostomy or noninvasive
methods of home mechanical ventilation. Six hundred eighty-four users of
assisted ventilation for 13,751 patient-years or 19.8 years per patient were
surveyed by mail and twice by telephone over a span of four years. Pneumonia
and hospitalization rates were significantly higher for ventilator users with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or with neuromuscular ventilatory
insufficiency and gastrostomy tubes than for ventilator users with
neuromuscular ventilatory insufficiency without gastrostomy tubes. Of the
latter group, more than 90% of the pneumonias and hospitalizations were
triggered by otherwise benign intercurrent upper respiratory tract infections.
Oxygen therapy was associated with a significantly (P &lt; 0.001) higher rate
of pneumonias and hospitalizations than that seen for untreated patients after
initial episodes of respiratory distress or during the use of either
tracheostomy intermittent positive pressure ventilation or noninvasive
ventilatory assistance methods. The lowest pneumonia and hospitalization rates
(P &lt; 0.001) were by full-time, noninvasive intermittent positive pressure
ventilation users. We conclude that oxygen therapy is not an effective
substitute for assisted ventilation for patients with primarily ventilatory
insufficiency. Noninvasive ventilatory aids can be used effectively for up to
full-time ventilatory support for patients with neuromuscular conditions whose
bulbar muscle function is adequate to avert the need for gastrostomy tube
placement. <p>

Title:  Reticuloendothelial "activation" noted after splenectomy for ITP and
presence of a post-poliomyelitis asymmetry.<p>
Source Clinical Nuclear Medicine.  23(1):8-9, 1998 Jan.<p>
Abstract:  A radiocolloid study was carried out, after splenectomy, in a
75-year-old man who had idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. The patient, who
did not have an increase in platelet counts after spleen removal or after
platelet infusions, showed radiocolloid accumulation in the lungs and in the
bone marrow. This suggested some "activation" of reticuloendothelial cells,
perhaps by circulating immune complexes. The left femur (site of an episode of
poliomyelitis many years previously) had less radiocolloid uptake than the
right. <p>

Abstract:  The cases of three patients with a history of paralytic
poliomyelitis in childhood who developed the flat back syndrome before or after
spinal fusion for degenerative disease as adults were reviewed. The flat back
syndrome, a combination of an inability to stand erect because of forward
flexion of the trunk and pain in the low back and/or legs, typically occurs in
the setting of decreased lumbar lordosis as a result of distraction
instrumentation of the spine for scoliosis, vertebral fracture, or degenerative
disease. Focus was placed on determining the factors responsible for the
development and/or persistence of the flat back syndrome in these patients
despite maintenance of, or partial operative restoration of, lumbar lordosis.
Considering the essential role that the trunk extensor musculature plays in
maintaining upright posture, it may be that a new onset of weakness (postpolio
syndrome) in this musculature represents a major contributing factor to the
flat back syndrome in these patients. Spine surgeons considering operative
procedures in patients with a remote history of paralytic poliomyelitis should
be aware of the possible increased risk of the flat back syndrome in this
population of patients. <p>

Abstract:  OBJECTIVES: To assess the usage of carbon fibre orthoses in
assisting post-polio syndrome patients who reported advancing weakness and
difficulty in maintaining their independent ambulatory status. DESIGN AND
INTERVENTIONS: Carbon fibre orthoses that are 30% lighter than metal braces
were constructed. SUBJECTS: Thirty patients who complained of difficulty in
maintaining their ambulation using long-leg braces were provided with
lightweight orthoses. RESULTS: Seventy per cent of the patients reported
satisfaction with their braces. There were, however, problems in construction
and use. CONCLUSIONS: Ambulation can be preserved in some patients who report
advancing weakness because of post-polio syndrome. <p>

Abstract:  Here we report a case of a 56-year-old male with post-poliomyelitis
muscular atrophy (PPMA), who presented with cranial nerve signs and widespread
atrophy of the extremities. He had suffered from poliomyelitis at the age of 2
years. After recovery from the acute stage, the paralysis remained in his left
arm. He noticed muscle weakness of the right upper and lower extremities at the
age of 45 years and the muscle atrophy progressed to his arms, hip and thigh at
the age of 55 years. Neurological examination revealed muscle atrophy of the
neck and disturbance of left V, VIII, IX, X and bilateral XI cranial nerves. We
diagnosed this case as PPMA from his history and electromyographic and muscle
biopsy findings which suggested chronic denervation. Among the 21 PPMA cases in
the past in which the acute poliomyelitis had resulted in paralysis of the only
one limb, ours was the only case that had muscle atrophy of all the limbs.
Cranial nerve involvement is known to occur in acute poliomyelitis; therefore,
there is a possibility that the involvement of the cranial nerves in our case
might be a delayed progressive symptoms. <p>

life; 36.32% of them could not play out-door and do shopping; 2.58% of them
could not normally communicate with others. 84.53% of the 1487 handicapped
victims caused by polio aged 15 or over wholly or partly lost their working
ability. We also compared handicapped people's employment rate and the status
of marriage with non-handicapped people. Data showed that the employment rate
and the number of married handicapped polio victims were remarkably lower then
those non-handicapped people. <p>

Abstract:  A prospective study was carried out on 12 patients with
postpoliomyelitis clawing of the hallux treated by a modified Jones procedure
using Kirschner wire for the interphalangeal joint fusion. The purpose of this
study was to evaluate the outcome of a modified Jones procedure in the
treatment of postpolio claw hallux deformity. All the patients had symptoms
related to the claw hallux deformity; foot biomechanics and gait were affected.
Patients were assessed both pre- and postoperatively using Axer's criteria.
Mean follow-up was 32 months. Ten patients had very good results and two
patients had fair results. The transferred extensor hallucis longus became
loose in two patients who had a coexistent tight Achilles tendon. Recurrence of
medial cavus deformity occurred 3 months after the operation in both of these
patients. This was treated by shortening the transferred extensor hallucis
longus after elongating the tight Achilles tendon. No pseudoarthrosis of the
interphalangeal joint was identified. When the Jones procedure is performed,
the motor power of the extensor hallucis longus should be Medical Research
Council Grade V before transfer. The Achilles tendon should be evaluated for
equinus preoperatively and lengthened when equinus deformity is present in
order to avoid residual foot deformities. <p>

Source Respiration.  64 Suppl 1:35-8, 1997.<p>
Abstract:  Patients with neuromuscular disease may suffer from nocturnal
respiratory failure despite normal daytime respiratory function. The
physiological reduction in muscle tone during sleep may be life-threatening in
a patient with impaired muscle strength. Nocturnal respiratory failure may
occur in patients with the postpolio syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
myasthenia gravis, myotonic dystrophy, and muscular dystrophy. Diagnosis of
obstructive, central and mixed apneas, hypopneas, and hypoventilation is best
made using polysomnography. Therapeutic options include noninvasive ventilation
such as continuous positive airway pressure, bilevel positive airway pressure,
intermittent positive pressure ventilation and, rarely, tracheostomy, oxygen,
or protriptyline. Evaluation by a sleep specialist should be initiated in any
neuromuscular patient with nocturnal symptoms such as air hunger, intermittent
snoring or breathing, orthopnea, cyanosis, restlessness, and insomnia. Daytime
symptoms may include morning drowsiness, headaches and excessive daytime
sleepiness. Polycythemia, hypertension, and signs of heart failure may also be
seen. Effective treatment is available, and may improve the quality of life,
and possibly increase survival. [References: 14] <p>

Source Muscle &amp; Nerve.  20(11):1341-51, 1997 Nov.<p>
Abstract:  Eleven patients with previous polio were studied. The concentration
of energy-related metabolites and energy charge was measured from the vastus
lateralis muscle, as was isometric muscle strength of knee extension.
Cross-sectional area of the quadriceps femoris muscle was calculated from
magnetic resonance imaging. Reinnervation was studied using
macroelectromyography. Muscle weakness, pain, and newly acquired muscle
weakness in the legs was estimated by the patients. The findings in the legs in
which the patients experienced new loss of muscle function were compared with
the stable legs. There were no significant differences between these groups in
any of the objectively measured variables. Only hip pain correlated with new
loss of muscle function. Creatine phosphate was decreased in 5 patients. The
symptoms and subjective muscle strength did not correlate with any of the
objective measurements. There were no significant relationships between
energy-related metabolites and postpolio symptoms. <p>

Title:  Effects of oral supplementation of coenzyme Q10 on 31P-NMR detected
skeletal muscle energy metabolism in middle-aged post-polio subjects and normal
volunteers.<p>
Source Molecular Aspects of Medicine.  18 Suppl:S291-8, 1997.<p>
Abstract:  The effects of oral supplementation of 100 mg coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)
for 6 months on muscle energy metabolism during exercise and recovery were
evaluated in middle-aged post-polio (n = 3) and healthy subjects (n = 4) by the
use of phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The metabolic
response to isometric plantar flexion at 60% of maximal voluntary contraction
force (MVC) for 1.5 min was determined in gastrocnemius muscles before, after
3- (3MO) and 6-month (6MO) of CoQ10 supplementation. The MVC of plantar flexion
was unchanged following CoQ10 supplementation. The resting Pi/PCr ratio in
gastrocnemius muscles of all subjects decreased after 3MO- and 6MO-CoQ10 (P
&lt; 0.05). The post-polio individuals showed a progressive decrease in this
ratio, while less pronounced changes were observed in the control subjects.
Similarly, the post-polio individuals showed a lower Pi/PCr ratio at the end of
60% MVC in both 3MO- and 6MO-CoQ10, whereas no change in the ratio was observed
in the control subjects. A less pronounced decrease in muscle pH was observed
at the end of 60% MVC in both 3MO- and 6MO-CoQ10 in the post-polio individuals,
but not in the control subjects. No systematic difference in end-exercise ATP
was observed between the three phases in both groups. The half-time of recovery
for PCr decreased in all subjects after 6MO-CoQ10 supplementation (P &lt;
0.05). The results suggest that CoQ10 supplementation affects muscle energy
metabolism in post-polio individuals to a greater extent than in control
subjects. The mechanism for this effect is not clear, but may involve an effect
of CoQ10 on peripheral circulation in the calf muscles, its action in
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and/or its antioxidant potential. <p>

Title:  The ability of male and female clinicians to effectively test knee
extension strength using manual muscle testing.<p>
Source Journal of Orthopaedic &amp; Sports Physical Therapy.  26(4):192-9, 1997
Oct.<p>
Abstract:  It has been suggested that the accuracy of manual muscle testing is
dependent on examiner strength. Our purpose was to relate male and female
clinicians' upper extremity strength to their ability to challenge the
quadriceps and detect weakness in patients using manual muscle testing.
Quadriceps muscles of seven men and 12 women with postpoliomyelitis were tested
manually by a male and female clinician while forces were recorded with a
hand-held dynamometer. Patients' maximal isometric knee extension force was
recorded with a Lido dynamometer and clinicians' maximal vertical push force
was recorded with the hand-held dynamometer. Manual muscle testing forces,
patient maximum quadriceps forces, and examiner push forces were compared with
repeated measures analysis of variance. Female examiners' maximal vertical push
force (235.7 +/- 54.3 N) was not significantly different from either female or
male patients' maximal quadriceps force (166.8 +/- 66.7 N and 341.6 +/- 123.7
N) but was only 60% and 40% of the isometric knee extension forces generated by
a group of normal women and men. Male examiners were significantly stronger
(357.0 +/- 93.4 N) than the female but not the male patients and produced 90%
and 60% of the normal isometric quadriceps forces for women and men. Examiners
gave appropriate grades in 30 of 38 tests. Examiner strength limits detection
of moderate quadriceps weakness with manual resistance. Most of the muscle test
grades, however, were appropriate, given the examiner's upper extremity
strength. Clinicians using manual muscle testing should determine their maximal
vertical push force and the extent of weakness they can detect. <p>

behavior, self-concept, and loneliness.<p>

76(5):378-82, 1997 Sep-Oct.<p>
Abstract:  To examine the effect of Type A behavior, self-concept, and
loneliness on completion of and compliance with a postpolio sequelae treatment
program, all 204 individuals who had been evaluated by the Postpolio Service
were mailed the Postpolio Fatigue Questionnaire, the revised UCLA Loneliness
Scale, and the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale. Patients were also asked to rate
the frequency of assistive device use, their engaging in self-care activities,
and requesting physical assistance from others; they had previously been
administered the brief Type A Scale. Of the 46 respondents, 63% had completed
the Postpolio Sequelae treatment program (completers), and 37% had either been
discharged for noncompliance or refused treatment (noncompleters). Wheelchair
use was significantly positively correlated with age at the time of contracting
polio, number of limbs affected by polio, the Loneliness score, and months
since leaving the treatment program, but significantly negatively correlated
with Social Self and Family Self scores on the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale.
Family Self score was significantly negatively correlated with crutch use but
significantly positively correlated with asking co-workers for assistance. The
frequency of taking two 15-minute breaks each day was significantly negatively
correlated with a Type A score. Noncompleters reported a 61% increase in muscle
weakness compared with a 1% decrease for completers. These results indicate
that Type A behavior must be decreased so polio survivors complete and comply
with a postpolio sequelae treatment program, be able to make necessary
lifestyle changes, and possibly feel less lonely. Friends and family members
must help polio survivors to accept lifestyle changes and support new assistive
device use if patients are to feel valuable within their families and society
and treat their postpolio sequelae. <p>

Abstract:  Over a four-year period, all in-patients at our department with the
diagnosis of polio-sequelae were clinically examined for development of new
neuromuscular deficit. 19 out of 125 patients (15%) had developed a postpolio
syndrome. All 19 had acquired additional functional deficit and 17 new,
localized pareses. Five patients had developed polio-related hypoventilation.
The mean time from acute poliomyelitis to debut of the post-polio syndrome was
39 years. The post-polio syndrome occurred in patients with severe pareses in
the acute stage, but was not related to age, sex or specific epidemic. Most of
the 106 other patients had similar subjective complaints but did not have any
clinical signs indicating new neuromuscular deficit. 67 of these patients had
tendinitis and/or myalgia and 83 had chronic pain. Whereas many patients have
progressive symptoms many years after poliomyelitis, only a minority develop
the post-polio syndrome. <p>

Abstract:  The purpose of this investigation was to study subjective symptoms,
medical and social situation, pulmonary function and physical work capacity
over a period of 3-5 years in patients with post-polio syndrome. We assessed a
consecutive series of 68 patients admitted to our hospital because of
post-polio syndrome, and re-assessed 63 of these patients 3-5 years later; 43
women and 20 men with mean age 55 +/- 10 (1 SD) years at the second evaluation.
The patients answered a questionnaire about their subjective symptoms and
medical and social situation, and underwent spirometry and symptom-limited
exercise stress testing. Most patients experienced more serious symptoms and
physical disability connected with their polio, while the majority reported
that their psychological health was unchanged or had improved. Lung function
was on average moderately reduced and of restrictive type, and only minor
changes were found over the 3-5 years. A pronounced reduction in peak oxygen
uptake was seen at the first evaluation, especially in women (59% of
predicted). At the second examination, peak oxygen uptake was further reduced,
especially in men, more than predicted by increasing age. The body weight and
body mass index of the patients increased significantly during the same period.
These results indicate that subjective symptoms and physical disability
connected with polio increased with increasing age in these patients with
post-polio syndrome, and cardio-respiratory deconditioning and weight gain also
became more serious problems in most patients. The psychological status of the
patients remained stable, however, or improved, possibly due to our
comprehensive re-rehabilitation and educational programme. <p>

Abstract:  "The Norwegian Polio Study 1994" was conducted in order to survey
the medical and social situation and the needs of polio victims. A
questionnaire consisting of 133 questions with subquestions was sent to a total
of 2,392 polio victims in Norway. 1,449 persons responded, of whom 66% were
between 45 and 64 years of age. When specifying new health problems, between
55% and 85% stated that they had experienced increasing weakness of the muscles
affected by polio, weakness in previously non-affected muscles, fatigue,
intolerance to cold and/or pain in muscles and joints. Only 17% were satisfied
with the public health services for polio victims. On the other hand, 67% of
those who had undergone a comprehensive evaluation and had been treated at a
central hospital were satisfied. The study indicates an obvious need to build
up expertise in multidisciplinary evaluation and treatment of post-polio
victims. <p>

cohort study during 11 years.<p>
Source European Respiratory Journal.  10(1):146-9, 1997 Jan.<p>
Abstract:  The object of this investigation was to prospectively study the
annual decline in lung function in a cohort of postpolio patients, and to
determine the usefulness of initial lung function tests in the prediction of a
subsequent poor outcome. Cross-sectional data were analysed in 55 patients from
the total cohort of 350 survivors of poliomyelitis in our admission area of
550,000 inhabitants. Longitudinal data (&gt; 5 yrs, average 8.9 yrs) were
available for 31 patients. Seventeen of the patients had a poor outcome (13
were started on domiciliary artificial ventilation and five died from
respiratory failure; with one overlap). At the time of entry to the study (on
average 4.3 years before the poor outcome), these patients had a lower vital
capacity (VC) (43 vs 65% of predicted; p &lt; 0.01) and arterial oxygen tension
(Pa,O2) (9.9 vs 11 kPa; p &lt; 0.05) and a higher arterial carbon dioxide
tension (Pa,CO2) (6.0 vs 5.0 kPa; p &lt; 0.01). They also had a more rapid
increase in Pa,CO2 (0.3 vs 0.03 kPa.yr-1; p &lt; 0.01), but the difference in
decline in VC (40 vs 30 mL.yr-1) was not significant. Initial VC &lt; 50% of
predicted and/or Pa,CO2 &gt; 6 kPa was associated with a poor prognosis. In
conclusion, annual decline in vital capacity was not abnormally rapid but
annual increase in arterial carbon dioxide tension was higher in patients with
a poor outcome. Initial determination of vital capacity and initial and
repeated blood gas analysis appear to be useful in identifying high-risk
postpolio patients. <p>

Abstract:  OBJECTIVE: To compare depressive symptoms and life satisfaction in
aging polio survivors with age-matched controls and to relate these outcomes to
scores to psychosocial and disability-related variables. DESIGN: A planned
medical, functional, and psychosocial study with multivariate analyses.
SETTING: A large, urban rehabilitation center. PARTICIPANTS: A volunteer sample
of 121 polio survivors and an age-matched control group of 60 people with
similar sociodemographic backgrounds. MAIN OUTCOMES: Depression as measured by
the Geriatric Depression Scale and an 11-item life satisfaction scale. RESULTS:
The prevalence of depressive disorders was not significantly different in the
two groups, although the postpolio group tended to have more symptomatology and
an overall depressive disorder prevalence of 28%. Some life satisfaction scale
scores were significantly lower in the postpolio group, especially those
concerned with health. People with postpolio syndrome scored significantly
higher on depression scales and lower on some life satisfaction scales than
people with a history of polio but without postpolio syndrome. Several
psychosocial variables, most notably family functioning and attitude toward
disability, helped to mediate this effect. Among people with significant
depression, there was little, evidence of adequate treatment in the community.
CONCLUSIONS: Postpolio by itself does not relate to higher depression scores or
lower life satisfaction. Postpolio syndrome has some relation to depression,
but family functioning and attitude toward disability are more important. There
is a need for better community-based psychological services. <p>

Title:  [The clinical use of an individually fitted nasal mask ("Freiburg
Respiratory Mask") within the scope of a case report of controlled BiPAP
ventilation]. [German]<p>
Source Pneumologie.  51 Suppl 3:798-801, 1997 Aug.<p>
Abstract:  PURPOSE: Noninvasive mechanical ventilation with nasal or face mask
using either BiPAP or IPPV (intermittent positive pressure ventilation) modes
is meanwhile the standard type of mechanical ventilation instead of
endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy in many patients with chronic and acute
respiratory failure. However, problems occur very often in noninvasive
mechanical ventilation due to mask problems with leakage of air out of the mask
or erasions and necrosis of the skin by constant pressure through the mask
frame. Hence, some clinical work groups developed customized molded masks
mostly in cooperation with dentistry labs. These masks, however, are often very
expensive and take several weeks to be manufactured. Our aim was to develop an
inexpensive (less than 600 USS) and easy-(in one day)-to-produce customized
nasal mask, the so-called "Freiburg nasal mask". We wish to show by a case
report the clinical efficacy of this customized mask in severe respiratory
failure. CASE AND METHOD: A 52 y old women (BMI 19, nonsmoker) suffering from a
severe hypercapnic respiratory failure (PCO2 over 100 mmHg) due to a severe
kyphoscoliosis as result of a postpoliosyndrome and already on controlled nasal
BiPAP with a standard respironics nasal mask, was referred to our clinic as an
emergency case. After not succeeding to normalise blood gases and clinical
status of the patient in mechanical ventilation on BiPAP mode and additional 2
lit/min of oxygen insufflation via the mask (patient was refusing invasive
ventilation) for 12 days due to mask leakage and mask discomfort we made a
mould of the patients face. Using this mould in a vacuum process the two EVA
polymers Erkoflex and Erkodent were combined to build up the customized mask
over the mould on the same day. In the first three days using the customized
mask in the patient PCO2 decreased below 70 mmHg, on the 8th day after starting
with the customized mask, blood gases almost normalised. Patient compliance in
using the BiPAP device increased from 8 h a day to 16 h a day. CONCLUSION: This
case shows that sometimes due to leakage of air in standard nasal masks
noninvasive mechanical ventilation may fail in patients with severe respiratory
failure. Therefore, in these patients customized moulded nasal or face masks
should be used instead of standard masks. We think that the Freiburg nasal mask
is an example of an easy to produce and nonexpensive customized mask and may be
used in such patients, as this case report shows. <p>

Abstract:  OBJECTIVE: To compare strength and endurance variables obtained in
the quadriceps muscles of postpolio and control subjects over a 7-year interval
with macro and single fiber electromyography (EMG) variables. DESIGN: A
controlled inception cohort study. SETTING: Neuromuscular research laboratory
of a university hospital. SUBJECTS: A cohort of 23 postpolio and 14 control
subjects. All postpolio subjects had a history, physical examination, and EMG
consistent with previous poliomyelitis, and had greater than antigravity
strength in the quadriceps muscle tested. Unstable postpolio subjects
acknowledged new quadriceps weakness over the 7-year period of the study (n =
11), and stable postpolio subjects denied new weakness of the quadriceps over
the same period (n = 12). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All subjects had tests of
neuromuscular function of the quadriceps muscles at the onset of this study and
yearly over a 7-year period. EMG variables were determined on a separate day
after the seventh year of neuromuscular measurements. Neuromuscular variables
measured were isometric knee extension peak torque, isometric endurance (time
to inability to maintain knee extensor contraction at 40% of maximal torque),
tension time index (TTI) (product of isometric endurance time and 40% of
maximal torque), and recovery of torque at 10 minutes after the endurance test.
EMG variables were macro EMG and single fiber EMG (jitter, fiber density, and
percent blocking). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Unstable postpolio subjects did not
lose strength more rapidly than stable postpolio subjects or control subjects.
Unstable postpolio subjects were significantly weaker, had decreased TTI,
larger macro EMG amplitude, greater jitter, blocking, and fiber density in
comparison with stable postpolio subjects (all p &lt; .05). Strength was
negatively correlated with macro EMG amplitude in the stable postpolio group (p
&lt; .05). The slope of the regression line of strength over 7 years did not
correlate (p &gt; .05) with neuromuscular or EMG variables in control, stable,
or unstable postpolio subjects. <p>

symptom-limited exercise stress testing. Most patients experienced increasing
symptoms and physical disability related to their polio, while the majority
reported that their mental health were unchanged or improved. The lung function
was in average moderately reduced of restrictive type, and only minor changes
were found during the 3-5 years. A pronounced reduction in peak oxygen uptake
was seen at the first evaluation, especially in women. At the second
examination, peak oxygen uptake was further decreased, especially in men, more
than predicted from increasing age. The patients increased their body mass
index significantly during the same period. These results indicate that
subjective symptoms and physical disability related to polio increased with
increasing age in these patients with the post-polio syndrome, and
cardiorespiratory deconditioning and weight gain also became increasing
problems in most patients. However, the mental status of the patients remained
stable or improved, possibly due to our comprehensive re-rehabilitation and

Source Neurologic Clinics.  15(3):481-500, 1997 Aug.<p>
Abstract:  The acquired motor neuron disorders are a heterogeneous group of
conditions in which motor neuron degeneration or dysfunction produces the
predominant manifestation of weakness, while the sensory system is clinically
spared. The disorders most commonly seen in clinical practice are amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, late manifestations of poliomyelitis, and lower motor neuron
syndromes, including motor neuropathy. Less often, acquired motor neuron
disorders may complicate metabolic, toxic, or systemic disorders. The
pathogenesis of most acquired motor neuron disorders is poorly understood, and
treatment is mainly supportive; however clues to understanding the pathogenesis
of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are emerging, and new pharmacologic therapies
are available. There is a growing sense of hope that combinations of drugs that
are currently being tested may impact the survival of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis. [References: 78] <p>

Abstract:  Post Polio Syndrome, or PPS, is defined as a clinical syndrome of
new weakness, fatigue, and pain in people who have previously recovered from
acute paralytic poliomyelitis. Other common symptoms include cold intolerance,
dysphagia, dyspnea, and overuse syndromes. PPS afflicts an estimated 50% of
polio survivors, a population estimated at 1.6 million people, and begins
roughly 30 years after the acute disease. The main impact of PPS is on mobility
related activities affecting one's daily routine. With an insidious onset, and
several differential diagnoses for each symptom, PPS can be difficult to
diagnose and to validate. However, once identified, there are treatment plans
and many avenues of support for this disabling syndrome. The purpose of this
article is to provide an overview of the pathophysiology of both acute
paralytic poliomyelitis as well as PPS. This article also reviews the current
literature concerning the etiology and pathophysiology of both poliomyelitis
and PPS, symptom evaluation and differential diagnoses, and treatment
recommendations. The psychosocial impact and care of the client are also
identified, and several resources for support and education of both the client
and provider are provided. [References: 46] <p>

Abstract:  Enteroviruses (Coxsackie A and B, echovirus, poliovirus) belong to a
group of small RNA-viruses, picomavirus, which are widespread in nature.
Enteroviruses cause a number of wellknown diseases and symptoms in humans, from
subclinical infections and the common cold to poliomyelitis with paralysis. The
development of polio vaccines is the greatest accomplishment within the field
of enterovirus research and the background work was awarded the Nobel prize in
1954. New knowledge implies that enteroviruses play a more important part in
the morbidity panorama than was previously thought. Chronic (persistent)
enteroviruses were formerly unknown. Serologic and molecular biology techniques
have now demonstrated that enteroviral genomes, in certain situations, persist
after the primary infection (which is often silent). Persistent enteroviral
infection or recurrent infections and/or virus-stimulated autoimmunity might
contribute to the development of diseases with hitherto unexplained
pathogenesis, such as post polio syndrome, dilated cardiomyopathy, juvenile
(type 1) diabetes and possibly some cases of chronic fatigue syndrome.

Abstract:  OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a 12-week home quadriceps muscle
strengthening exercise program would increase muscle strength, isometric
endurance, and tension time index (TTI) in postpolio syndrome subjects without
adversely affecting the surviving motor units or the muscle. DESIGN: A
longitudinal study to investigate the effect of a 12-week exercise program on
neuromuscular function and electromyographic variables. SETTING: Neuromuscular
laboratory of a university hospital. SUBJECTS: Seven subjects were recruited
from a cohort of 12 subjects who had participated in a previous exercise study.
All subjects had greater than antigravity strength of the quadriceps. Upon
completion of a postpolio questionnaire, all acknowledged common postpolio
syndrome symptoms such as new fatigue, pain, and weakness; 6 of the 7
acknowledged new strength decline. INTERVENTION: On Mondays and Thursdays
subjects performed three sets of four maximal isometric contractions of the
quadriceps held for 5 seconds each. On Tuesdays and Fridays subjects performed
three sets of 12 dynamic knee extension exercises with ankle weights. MAIN
OUTCOME MEASURES: Neuromuscular variables of the quadriceps muscles were
measured at the beginning and completion of the exercise program and included:
isokinetic peak torque (ISOKPT, at 60 degrees/sec angular velocity) and total
work performed of four contractions (ISOKTW), isometric peak torque (MVC),
endurance (EDUR, time subject could hold isometric contraction at 40% of the
initial MVC), isometric tension time index (TTI, product of endurance time and
torque at 40% of MVC), and initial and final ankle weight (WGT, kg) lifted.
Electromyographic variables included: fiber density (FD), jitter (MCD), and
blocking (BLK) from single fiber assessment and median macro amplitude (MACRO).
Serum creatine kinase (CK) was also measured initially and at 4-week intervals
throughout the study. RESULTS: The following variables significantly (p &lt;
.05) increased: WGT by 47%, ISOKPT, 15%, ISOKTW, 15%; MVC, 36%; EDUR, 21%; TTI,
18%. The following variables did not significantly (p &gt; .05) change: FD,
MCD, BLK, MACRO, and CK. CONCLUSIONS: This home exercise program significantly
increased strength, endurance, and TTI without apparently adversely affecting
the motor units or the muscle, as the EMG and CK variables did not change. <p>

Abstract:  Recent research has shed light on the pathogenesis of the postpolio
syndrome and has helped explain its symptoms and the rationale for management.
The aim of this article is to familiarize physicians with this syndrome. The
history, acute infection, definition, and diagnosis are discussed, as well as
the various symptoms and their management. People with postpolio syndrome can
educate health professionals about this condition and can help others inflicted
with this syndrome. Thus far, no cure is available. A correct diagnosis is
important, and the physician must realize that severe comorbidities tend to
afflict people with this syndrome. Numerous management options are available to
help these people enjoy a high quality of life. [References: 67] <p>

Abstract:  The aim of the study was to seek knowledge of psychological and
psychosocial aspects of coping with late effects of polio. Sixty-three polio
survivors, 43 women and 20 men (mean age 55.3 years) 3-5 years ago former
inpatients at the Post-Polio Program at Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital,
participated in the study. In addition to a semi-structured interview-guide,
the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD), the Sickness Impact Profile
(SIP), Cope-Scale, Brief Type-A Questionnaire (BTAQ) and the Fatigue Severity
Scale (FSS) were used. As a measure of physical status, we used working
capacity defined as peak O2 (oxygen) uptake. Levels of working capacity did not
correlate significantly with any psychological variables, and the subjects
reporting improved psychological health over the last 3-5 years did not have
higher levels of working capacity or less physical decrement. A significant
correlation was found between self-reported fatigue. psychological variables
and social support. Compared to previous studies, low psychological distress,
normal type-A scores, high adjustment and problem-focused coping characterized
the respondents, pointing to the importance of timing in psychosocial research
of post-polio. <p>

Title:  Quantitative assessments of elbow flexor muscle performance using
twitch interpolation in post-polio patients: no evidence for deterioration.<p>
Source Brain.  120 ( Pt 4):663-72, 1997 Apr.<p>
Abstract:  A large number of patients previously affected by polio have
symptoms, including increased weakness and fatigue, which are collectively
known as a post-polio syndrome. Prospective measurements of strength and
endurance using twitch interpolation in post-polio patients are lacking and
hence the exact rate of decline in muscle function in these patients is not
well defined. We therefore measured performance of the elbow flexor muscles
twice, at a mean of 2.5 years apart in a group of selected post-polio subjects
(Group A, n = 13) and matched control subjects (n = 11), and in a second group
of unselected polio patients from a post-polio clinic (Group B, n = 40) at a
mean of 1.7 years apart. All subjects performed 10 attempted maximal voluntary
isometric contractions of the elbow flexor muscles, during which voluntary
activation of the elbow flexor muscles was measured using a sensitive form of
twitch interpolation. The first group of selected polio subjects (Group A) and
matched control subjects also performed 45 min of submaximal exercise. During
this time, at 5-min intervals, maximal voluntary force, voluntary activation
and the amplitude of twitch responses to single and paired stimuli were
measured in order to investigate central and peripheral components of muscle
fatigue. There was no change in the polio patients' strength, voluntary
activation or peripheral muscle endurance between testing sessions, despite an
80% probability of detecting a 2.5% change per year in these variables. The
unselected group of patients from the post-polio clinic (Group B) showed no
change in maximal voluntary strength or voluntary activation between the first
and second test. There was an absence of decline in muscle performance in these
polio patients over the test interval, despite a subjective deterioration in
muscle function consistent with the 'post-polio syndrome'. This supports the
view that symptoms of the post-polio syndrome are not due to a progressive
neuronal dysfunction. <p>

Source Journal of General Virology.  77 ( Pt 7):1469-76, 1996 Jul.<p>
Abstract:  We have searched, using a sensitive nested-PCR, for enterovirus RNA
in cerebrospinal fluid and post mortem central nervous system (CNS) tissue from
patients with previous poliomyelitis with or without late functional
deterioration, patients with motor neuron disease (MND), and control patients
with other neurological disease or without neurological disease. Enterovirus
RNA was detected in patients with previous poliomyelitis and MND, but also in
control patients with and without neurological disease. Our results do not
provide any evidence that such enterovirus infection is related to late
functional deterioration in patients with previous poliomyelitis, which could
be attributed to other medical conditions in most instances, and do not support
the hypothesis that MND is associated with enterovirus infection of the CNS.
Nucleotide sequence analysis of enterovirus RNA sequences detected indicated
that enteroviruses detected were of the non-polio type. <p>

Abstract:  The disorder consists of fatigue accompanied by new muscle weakness
and muscle pain or, for patients whose acute polio had included bulbar
involvement, new difficulty in swallowing or change in voice. The epidemiology
remains unclear, fueling anxiety among polio survivors. Yet its course is not
drastically progressive, and impairment is usually limited. [References: 6] <p>

Abstract:  Fifteen cases of paralysis of the quadriceps muscles secondary to
poliomyelitis were managed by hamstring tendon transfers with an average
follow-up of 48 months. Results of 13.5% excellent, 73% good, and 13.5% fair
were obtained, according to an objective scoring system. Significant
improvement in gait pattern, relief from brace use, or "hand-on-thigh"
ambulation was seen in all cases. A mean extension lag of 30 degrees was
observed in patients examined in the sitting position. Lack of active terminal
knee flexion, prohibiting comfortable floor sitting, was the main untoward
effect and the source of complaint in four patients. <p>

Abstract:  Polysomnographic evaluation in the sleep laboratory is recommended
for patients with neuromuscular disorders who develop symptoms and sign of
sleep-wake abnormality or nocturnal respiratory failure. Nocturnal
sleep-related ventilatory alterations may occur in disproportion to the
severity of the neuromuscular disorder. Diaphragmatic paralysis occurring in
the context of a neuromuscular disorder is often an overlooked complication.
Failure to thrive, daytime tiredness, and incapacitating fatigue may be the
result of a potentially correctable sleep-related abnormality and not due to
relentless progression of the neuromuscular condition. Application of CPAP and
BiPAP and administration of supplemental oxygen are relatively simple,
noninvasive, ambulatory, therapeutic maneuvers that may correct sleep-related
ventilatory alterations in patients with neuromuscular disorders. [References:

[53 refs]<p>

Abstract:  Swallowing difficulties, oral motor weakness, and oral pharyngeal
paralysis have been reported in the historical literature on polio and
post-polio. Attention to this finding was minimal in the original epidemics as
many persons with bulbar polio who may have been dysphagic did not survive.
Swallowing was often supplemented by artificial feeding for those who were
placed in respirators. Although swallowing difficulty was often present in the
acute stages of the initial attack, it usually subsided or disappeared after
several weeks. In cases in which bulbar polio was diagnosed, swallowing
impairment may have lingered, but most survivors learned to produce
compensatory maneuvers to aid them to swallow and did not complain of
difficulty. In the recent decades of the 20th century, many persons who had
believed themselves fully recovered from the insult of polio began to
experience new symptoms; among them were new or heightened complaints of
swallowing difficulty. Studies of these patients with PPS have revealed that
dysphagia is not only present but may be progressive, and suggest that there is
a slowly progressive deterioration of the bulbar neurons of PPS patients
underlying the finding of new or exacerbated swallowing signs. Patients with
PPS should be referred to speech-language pathologists for evaluation of voice,
phonatory-respiratory, and swallowing function and initiation of appropriate
remediation strategies to avoid the potential negative consequences of
dysphagia. [References: 53] <p>

Abstract:  The thigh and lower leg of six patients with prior polio were
examined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the strength of their weak
foot dorsiflexors was measured isokinetically. Spinecho images of the lower
extremities were visually evaluated on a semi-quantitative four-point scale,
and T1 and T2 relaxation times of the lower leg anterior compartment were
analysed. There were prominent MRI signs of randomly distributed muscle
degeneration. The high signal intensity changes in the affected muscles on
T1-weighted images and T1 and T2 values indicated replacement of muscle fibres
with fat and the accumulation of tissue water, respectively. MRI findings were
compared with isokinetic strength in foot dorsiflexor muscles. Foot dorsiflexor
peak torque values at 30 deg/s ranged from 6 to 29 Nm. There was no significant
correlation between MRI visual scoring, T1 and T2 relaxation times and peak
torque values at 30 deg/s. However, the most severe MRI changes with visual
scoring and T2 relaxation times were observed in the patients with the most
pronounced muscle weakness. <p>

Abstract:  To determine the character and prevalence of bladder dysfunction
among persons with a history of polio, we conducted a survey of randomly
selected polio survivors. The survey solicited information on the acute episode
of polio and the nature of late-onset neurologic symptoms that could be
attributed to postpolio syndrome. There were 242 female and 88 male respondents
to the study. Symptoms attributable to postpolio syndrome were present in 87.2%
of female subjects and 73.9% of male subjects. Respondents with postpolio
syndrome had a significantly greater prevalence of urologic symptoms than seen
among respondents without postpolio syndrome, although no dominant pattern of
voiding dysfunction was noted. The early onset of erectile dysfunction was more
common among male subjects with postpolio syndrome than among male subjects
without postpolio syndrome. Genuine stress incontinence was seen in 36.3% of
the survey population. Sixteen women with postpolio syndrome underwent surgical
repair for urinary incontinence, with a success rate of 60.5%. Bladder
disorders are common among persons with PPS, but further clinical and
urodynamic data are necessary to define the nature and magnitude of this
dysfunction. <p>

Abstract:  1996 is polio awareness year. This paper reviews the clinical
syndrome of acute paralytic poliomyelitis and its sequelae. We discuss
epidemiological studies of the syndrome of late functional deterioration many
years after the acute infection and the current hypotheses of the
pathophysiology of such disorders. Recent evidence has suggested that
potentially treatable factors may be implicated in the majority of such
patients and it is therefore important to exclude such disorders before
attributing late functional deterioration to progressive post-polio muscular
atrophy. [References: 57] <p>

Abstract:  The postpolio syndrome (PPS) is characterized by new neuromuscular
symptoms occurring 30 to 40 years after the acute episode of poliomyelitis
paralysis. The presence of the poliovirus RNA genome in the cerebrospinal fluid
from 10 patients with PPS and from 23 control patients was sought by using
reverse transcription and a PCR specific for polioviruses and/or other
enteroviruses. Poliovirus-specific genomic sequences in the 5' untranslated
region and in the capsid region (VP1) were detected by reverse transcription
PCR in 5 of 10 patients with PPS but in none of the control patients.
Sequencing confirmed the presence of mutated poliovirus sequences. This finding
suggests persistent viral infection in the central nervous system related to
the presence of poliovirus genomes. <p>

Abstract:  Fatigue is the most commonly reported and most disabling of all
post-polio sequelae (PPS). Bromocriptine mesylate (Parlodel) was employed in a
placebo-controlled trial in five survivors of paralytic polio who continued to
report moderate to severe daily fatigue after complying with the conservative
treatments prescribed for PPS. Placebo was given for 4 wk followed by
increasing doses of bromocriptine mesylate, administered at 12:00 pm for 28
days, which reached a total dose of 12.5 mg/day. Three subjects reported marked
symptom improvement on bromocriptine but not on placebo. Their reported
difficulty with attention, concentration, word finding, mind wandering, memory,
thinking clearly, and fatigue on awakening was significantly negatively
correlated with days on bromocriptine but not with days on placebo. Before the
drug trial began, responders had clinically impaired performance on
neuropsychologic tests of attention and information processing speed, more than
twice as many hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain,
abnormally low fasting adrenocorticotropic hormone levels, and nearly double
the mean plasma prolactin level compared with nonresponders. The implications
of these findings for the pathophysiology of fatigue are discussed. A
double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study will be needed to confirm
bromocriptine's efficacy in treating attentionally and neurophysiologically
impaired polio survivors whose severe and disabling fatigue does not respond to
conservative therapies. <p>

Jun.<p>
Abstract:  OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the prevalence of sleep-related and
sleep-disordered-breathing (SDB)-related complaints in a group of postpolio
patients compared with healthy controls. DESIGN: A questionnaire, consisting of
the validated Sleep Wake Experience List (SWEL), and a list of questions
pertaining to sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), was mailed to a group of 43
postpolio patients. PARTICIPANTS: The patient group consisted of 43 former
polio patients who had been evaluated at a neuromuscular disease clinic in a
tertiary referral center for new complaints of progressive muscle weakness. The
patients were requested to select two healthy controls from their neighborhood
who also filled out a questionnaire. RESULTS: In the group of postpolio
patients the frequency of tiredness on waking up and during the day, headache
on waking up, daytime sleepiness, and restless legs was significantly higher
compared with the control group. Complaints specifically related to SDB, such
as apneas and snoring, were not mentioned significantly more often by the
postpolio patients. CONCLUSION: Up to half of postpolio patients report
complaints of disordered sleep, which is likely to influence daytime
functioning. Further studies, including sleep studies into SDB and restless
legs, are necessary to elucidate the causes for these complaints. <p>

Abstract:  OBJECTIVE: To study changes in cross-sectional thigh muscle area and
muscle strength in late polio subjects over a 4-year period. DESIGN:
Longitudinal study of a cohort of polio survivors, comparing subjects who
acknowledge (unstable) with those who do not acknowledge (stable) new muscle
weakness. SETTING: University hospital. SUBJECTS: Eighteen subjects (6 men, 12
women) with polio-myelitis sequelae (39 to 46 years of age) were studied on two
occasions 4 years apart; the first examination was 37 to 44 years after onset
of polio. Subjects were recruited through hospital registers, newspaper
advertisement, and a patient organization. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Thigh muscle
and intermuscular and intramuscular adipose tissue (AT) cross-sectional areas
were measured by computed tomography. Isometric muscle strength for knee
extension and flexion was measured using a Kin-Com dynamometer. RESULTS:
Cross-sectional muscle area decreased on average 1.3 +/- 3.6 cm2 (1.4%, p &lt;
.05); the intermuscular and intramuscular AT area increased 1.8 +/- 3.4 cm2
(12.1%, p &lt; .05). When divided by legs in which subjects reported (unstable)
or did not report (unstable) or did not report (stable) increased muscle
weakness, unstable legs showed significant reduction (p &lt; .05) in muscle
area, whereas stable legs did not. Estimated total thigh muscle strength
decreased 7.8% +/- 2.9% (p &lt; .01), with a significant (p &lt; .001)
reduction in unstable legs (13.4% +/- 4.3%) but not in stable legs. The
reduction in strength appears to be greater than the reduction in
cross-sectional muscle area, but there is still a significant correlation (r =
.44, p &lt; .05). CONCLUSION: The present results demonstrate not only progress
of muscle weakness, but also of muscle atrophy in postpolio subjects. <p>

caused lameness. The prevalence rate was 0.44%, the rate was higher in plains
than in hilly and mountainous areas. Rate was higher in ural than in urban
areas. The disease mainly occurred in children at age below 3. The result
showed that there were two epidemic peaks during 1976-1991, but the incidence
rate tended to be declining. The incidence rate was the lowest in 1991. Many
cases were not reported during 1976-1988. <p>

Abstract:  A 17-year-old patient presented with paralytic valgus left foot
deformity after poliomyelitis. Forefoot instability resulted from the transfer
of peroneus brevis to the second metatarsal bone. This was secondary to a
medial gapping of the talonavicular joint as a result of unbalanced pull of the
transferred tendon. Talonavicular arthrodesis following a medial-based wedge
articular resection has corrected the deformity. <p>

Abstract:  Over half a million Americans who had paralytic poliomyelitis as
children or young adults are at risk for experiencing the unexpected late
effects of post-poliomyelitis syndrome (PPS). When hospitalized or treated for
a variety of conditions requiring medical or surgical interventions, these
individuals present challenges which include life-threatening complications.

without apparent adverse effect in postpolio patients.<p>

1996 Jan-Feb.<p>
Abstract:  The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a
low-intensity, alternate-day, 12 wk quadriceps muscle-strengthening exercise
program on muscle strength and muscle and motor unit integrity in 12 postpolio
patients. Patients performed six to ten repetitions of a 5-s duration knee
extension exercise with ankle weights. After completing six repetitions,
patients rated the perceived exertion (RPE) in the exercised muscle. The
patient continued repetitions until RPE was &gt;/= 17 or ten repetitions were
performed. The weight was increased the next exercise day whenever the RPE was
&lt; 17 after ten repetitions. Before and after the training program, median
macroamplitude as well as jitter and blocking were determined
electromyographically (EMG), serum creatine kinase (CK) was measured, and
quadriceps muscle strength was assessed. The ankle weight lifted after 2 wk of
training and at the end of the program were also recorded. Although the ankle
weight lifted at the end of the program significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased
from a mean +/- SD of 7.1 +/- 2.7 to 11.2 +/- 4.7 kg, the dynametrically
determined muscle strength measures did not significantly (P &gt; 0.05)
increase. The EMG and the serum CK variables also did not significantly (P
&gt;0.05) change as a result of the exercise program. We conclude that
performance was improved, as demonstrated by an increase in the amount of
weight the patients lifted in the exercise program. No evidence was found to
show that this program adversely affected the motor units or the muscle as the
EMG and CK did not change. <p>

Abstract:  The aim of this paper is to describe a patient with severe postpolio
problems who developed achalasia. A 66-year-old patient came to our observation
for severe dysphagia. He had suffered from paralytic poliomyelitis at the age
of 7 months and had severe residual deficits. At the age of 62 he presented
with sudden pain localized in the distribution of the C4 and C5 dermatomes and
an inability to abduct the left arm. At the time, he experienced only
occasional and mild dysphagia; his esophagus was not dilated and emptied
normally. Over the following months his muscular function improved, but
dysphagia worsened. We found a megaesophagus with a sigmoid appearance and the
manometric features of achalasia. Pneumatic dilatation produced good resolution
of dysphagia. A year later manometry showed the reappearance of peristalsis
after all wet swallows. In patients with postpolio dysphagia, the possible
presence of achalasia must be considered. [References: 20] <p>

Abstract:  Forty-three former polio patients now complaining of new progressive
muscle weakness (symptomatic patients) plus 13 former polio patients without
new neuromuscular complaints were included in the study. The symptomatic
patients reported high frequencies of other neuromuscular complaints and a
decline in their functional level. Most frequent complaints were general
fatigue, low backache, and muscle pain (97.7%, 86%, and 79.1%, respectively)
and a decline in the ability to walk (80%). In a prospective follow-up
averaging 2.1 years, the muscle strength of 26 muscles in all four limbs of
each patient was assessed by manual muscle testing and was also measured
isometrically using a handheld dynamometer. During the follow-up period, we did
not find a significant decrease in muscle strength in the symptomatic patients
as compared to patients without new neuromuscular complaints. <p>

Abstract:  Delayed consequences of polio virus infection are of growing
interest because of the increasing incidence of new symptoms in patients who
previously had poliomyelitis. We examined 121 patients with an earlier
diagnosis of acute anterior poliomyelitis for features of the postpolio
syndrome using the criteria of Halstead and found evidence of the syndrome in
68.07% of the patients. Meaningful management of these patients requires
recognition of the clinical features of the condition and a collaborative
approach involving physicians, physiotherapists, psychotherapists and social
workers. <p>

[60 refs]<p>

Abstract:  Recent studies have shown that judicious exercise can improve muscle
strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, and the efficiency of ambulation in
post-polio patients. It may also add to the patient's sense of well-being.
These benefits appear to occur when the patients stay within reasonable bounds
while exercising in order to avoid overuse problems. In particular, the
patients should be instructed to avoid activities that cause increasing muscle
or joint pain or excessive fatigue, either during or after their exercise
program. The literature indicates that exercise within these constraints leads
to a number of beneficial physiologic and psychologic adaptations in patients
with post-polio syndrome. Judicious exercise should be viewed as important
adjuvant in the overall therapeutic program of the patient. Patients seen in
post-polio clinics frequently complain of new fatigue, weakness, muscle pain,
and/or joint pain. The most frequent complaints involving activities of daily
living include new difficulties with walking and stair climbing. The
therapeutic benefit of exercise in these patients to minimize or reverse
decline in function is an important question frequently asked by patients with
post-polio syndrome. In the general population, physical activity is known to
be an important adjunct to good health, bestowing both physiologic and
psychologic benefits leading to a reduction in the risk to develop a number of
serious ailments as well as leading to better psychological adjustment. On the
other hand, limitation in physical activity results in a number of deleterious
effects. Patients with post-polio syndrome have unique problems, however, which
need to be considered when prescribing an exercise program for an individual
patient. A number of functional etiologies for declining function have been
hypothesized including disuse weakness, overuse weakness, weight gain, and
chronic weakness. Because of the variability in which the motor neurons to
different muscle groups may have been affected in a particular patient, both
asymmetric and scattered weakness may be present. The challenge in prescribing
exercise for the patient with post-polio syndrome comes in recognizing these
unique factors in each patient and modifying the prescription accordingly. One
must protect muscles and joints experiencing the adverse effects of overuse or
body areas with very significant chronic weakness (in general, in areas where
the muscles have less than antigravity strength on manual muscle testing) while
exercising those body areas experiencing the deleterious effects of disuse.
Weight gain is to be avoided if at all possible in this population, because
increased weight only leads to further difficulty in the performance of daily
activities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) [References: 60] <p>

calf as a source of late pain and fatigue of muscles of the thigh after
poliomyelitis.<p>

1995 Aug.<p>
Abstract:  The purpose of this study was to identify overuse of muscles and
other alterations in the mechanics of gait in twenty-one patients who had
muscular dysfunction as a late consequence of poliomyelitis. All of the
patients had good or normal strength (grade 4 or 5) of the vastus lateralis and
zero to fair strength (grade 0 to 3) of the calf, as determined by manual
testing. Dynamic electromyography was used, while the patients were walking, to
quantify the intensity and duration of contraction of the inferior part of the
gluteus maximus, the long head of the biceps femoris, the vastus lateralis, and
the soleus muscles. Patterns of contact of the foot with the floor,
temporal-spatial parameters, and motion of the knee and ankle were recorded.
The principal mechanisms of substitution for a weak calf muscle fell into three
groups: overuse of the quadriceps (twelve patients) or a hip extensor (the
inferior part of the gluteus maximus in eight patients and the long head of the
biceps femoris in four), or both; equinus contracture (twelve patients); and
avoidance of loading-response flexion of the knee (five patients). Most
patients used more than one method of substitution. These observations support
the theory that post-poliomyelitis syndrome results from long-term
substitutions for muscular weakness that place increased demands on joints,
ligaments, and muscles and that treatment--based on the early identification of
overuse of muscles and ligamentous strain--should aim at modification of
lifestyle and include use of a brace. <p>

Abstract:  A cohort study with initial and 4-year follow-up evaluations was
performed in 78 post-polio volunteers aged 34-65 years at the time of enrolment
in the study, which was made to compare post-polio individuals living in Sweden
and the United States, to determine whether lower limb musculature becomes
weaker over time, and to determine whether individuals with complaints of
post-polio syndrome, new weakness, fatigue, walking or stair climbing
difficulty were weaker or lost more strength over a 4-year interval than those
individuals without such complaints. Dynametrically-measured knee extensor and
flexor strength and questionnaire data were obtained initially and 4 years
later. The two cohorts were fairly similar, though they differed in weight
gain. The Americans gained significantly (p &lt; 0.05) more weight than the
Swedish subjects. Both groups lost significant (p &lt; 0.05) knee extensor
strength (approximately 8%), but the loss was not significantly (p &lt; 0.05)
different between the groups. Knee flexor strength did not change significantly
(p &lt; 0.05) over time. Subjects acknowledging new strength loss were not
significantly (p &lt; 0.05) weaker than those denying strength loss; however,
they lost significantly (p &lt; 0.05) more isometric knee extensor strength
than the other individuals. Subjects acknowledging new fatigue, walking or
stair climbing difficulty were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) weaker in both
muscle groups than those without such complaints. Subjects acknowledging
post-polio syndrome were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) weaker than those denying
this symptom, but the amount of loss of strength over time was not
significantly (p &lt; 0.05) different. We conclude that the two cohorts were
quite similar. Knee extensor strength decreased during the study interval.
Individuals acknowledging post-polio syndrome had weaker knee extensor
musculature. Subjects with new fatigue, walking difficulty, or stair climbing
difficulty were weaker in both the knee extensors and the knee flexors than the
other subjects. Subjects reporting new muscle weakness also had a greater
decline in isometric knee extensor strength during the study interval than
those without such complaint. <p>

knowledge of the etiopathogenesis of PPS and PPMA and their possible therapy.

Abstract:  OBJECTIVE: Post-polio subjects experience functional deterioration
many years after developing acute poliomyelitis and have been shown previously
to have a deficit in strength recovery after isometric activity. This study
characterized the size and stability of the motor units in a group of
post-polio subjects with macro and single fiber electromyography (EMG) and
correlated these variables with isometric strength, endurance, "work capacity,"
and strength recovery after fatiguing isometric exercise. DESIGN: A cohort of
12 post-polio subjects was tested for neuromuscular function. Electromyographic
variables were determined on a separate day. SETTING: Volunteers were recruited
from the community and tested in our neuromuscular research laboratory.
SUBJECTS: A volunteer sample was obtained from advertisements. All subjects
acknowledged post-polio syndrome symptoms. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neuromuscular
variables were isometric knee extension peak torque, endurance (time to
exhaustion) at 40% of maximal torque, tension time index, and recovery of
torque at 10 minutes. Electromyographic variables were macro EMG and single
fiber EMG (percent blocking and jitter). RESULTS: Macro EMG amplitude was
ninefold the control value, and both jitter and blocking were greatly increased
in comparison to control values. Isometric strength significantly (p &lt; .05)
correlated negatively with macro EMG amplitude. CONCLUSIONS: The weakest
subjects had the greatest number of muscle fibers within the motor unit (as
measured by macro EMG amplitude). Jitter and blocking did not correlate with
neuromuscular function. <p>

correct the calcaneus deformity, after reduction of the calcaneus in the
subtalar joint, using a Steinmann pin passed through the calcaneus. Good
results were obtained in patients treated by arthrodesis. However, the
deformity recurred in patients treated only with tendon transfer. <p>

immunopathology.<p>

Abstract:  Post-polio syndrome (PPS) describes the clinical onset of
progressive muscular weakness many years after survival of acute paralytic
poliomyelitis, often in muscle groups clinically unaffected by the original
disease process. Prior pathologic descriptions of this often disabling, but not
usually fatal, syndrome have been scanty. These have emphasized the presence of
persistent or new inflammation in the meninges, spinal cord, and muscles of
affected patients. The inflammation suggests several pathogenetic hypotheses,
including persistent active poliovirus infection, autoimmune attack on central
and peripheral nervous system elements, or increased vulnerability of
poliovirus-damaged tissue to new infections. We have recently examined the
central nervous system from a PPS patient. The cord showed focal perivascular
intraparenchymal chronic inflammatory infiltrates. Immunoperoxidase staining
demonstrated that the infiltrates were virtually pure populations of B
lymphocytes (immunopositive with antibody L26, and immunonegative with the T
cell marker UCHL1 as well as the macrophage marker HAM56). There were rare
macrophages (HAM56 immunopositive) and no T cells. The character of the
infiltrates suggests that PPS could be an autoimmune disorder mediated by
antibodies produced in situ, and not by a cell-mediated process. Additional
important pathological features were the presence in the anterior horns of
axonal spheroids and of moderate Wallerian degeneration in the lateral columns.
The brain was entirely unremarkable, with no detectable cell loss of gliosis in
the internal capsules or precentral gyri. <p>

Abstract:  Twelve patients (14 feet) with the diagnosis of postpolio syndrome
underwent patients-specific transfer of perimalleolar tendons to the os calcis
for triceps surae insufficiency. One to 5 tendons were transferred, for a
resulting mean muscle strength of Grade 3 at a mean followup of 2.7 years. At
final followup, 7 patients were restudied with ankle plantar flexion torque
measurements, range of motion, and gait analysis. Patients reported subjective
improvements in endurance (86%), pain (90%), and ambulatory distance (50%). No
progression of foot deformity was noted. Three of 5 patients became brace free.
After tendon transfer, patients recorded increased ankle plantar flexion torque
strength (80%) and an increase in 1 grade of muscle strength (29%). There was
no significant change in gait velocity, stride length, or heeloff time between
pre- and postoperative gait analysis. No tenodesis effect was observed. In
conclusion, perimalleolar tendon transfers for triceps surae insufficiency in
postpolio patients was effective in decreasing subjective complaints, arresting
progressive foot deformity caused by muscle imbalance, and increasing plantar
flexion strength, whereas the results of gait analysis failed to show
significant improvement. <p>

Abstract:  A recent study of 10 men with postpolio syndrome indicated a low
secretion of growth hormone (GH) as reflected by serum insulin-like growth
factor-I (IGF-1). Therefore, 87 patients were studied, 17 to 71 years after
acute poliomyelitis, of whom 65% reported the occurrence of new or increased
weakness (ie, during the last 2 years) in muscles previously affected by polio.
Serum IGF-1 concentrations in the patients were compared with those found in a
reference population comprising 392 randomly selected individuals. No
differences from the reference population values were observed. No correlation
was found between IGF-1 concentrations and the severity of the original polio
affliction, the recovery status, the need for ambulation aids, or the presence
of new symptoms. The results do not indicate a need for GH substitution
treatment of patients with postpolio syndrome. <p>

Source Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.  753:96-102, 1995 May 25.<p>
Abstract:  Post-poliomyelitis respiratory impairment is extremely common and
entails considerable risk of morbidity and mortality. Respiratory muscle
weakness is the primary etiological factor but post-poliomyelitis individuals
(PPIs) also have a high incidence of scoliosis, obesity, sleep disordered
breathing, and bulbar muscle dysfunction, all of which can add to the risk. One
hundred forty-five PPIs were managed by noninvasive alternatives to
intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) via an indwelling
tracheostomy. When properly managed in this manner, acute respiratory failure
requiring hospitalization, tracheal intubation, and bronchoscopies were
avoided. Timely introduction of mouthpiece IPPV, nasal IPPV, manually and
mechanically assisted coughing, and noninvasive blood gas monitoring in the
home were the principal techniques used for optimizing quality of life and for
avoiding complications. <p>

clinical description. [Review] [63 refs]<p>

Abstract:  Post-polio syndrome (PPS) refers to the new neuromuscular symptoms
that occur at least 15 years after stability in patients with prior acute
paralytic polio-myelitis. They include: (1) new muscle weakness and atrophy in
the limbs, the bulbar or the respiratory muscles [post-poliomyelitis muscular
atrophy (PPMA)] and (2) excessive muscle fatigue and diminished physical
endurance. PPS is a clinical diagnosis that requires exclusion of all other
medical, neurological, orthopedic or psychiatric diseases that could explain
the cause of the new symptoms. Routine electromyography is useful to confirm
chronic and ongoing denervation and exclude neuropathies. Muscle biopsy, single
fiber electromyography (EMG), macro-EMG, serum antibody titers to polio virus,
and spinal fluid studies are very useful research tools but they are rarely
needed to establish the clinical diagnosis. PPS is a slowly progressive
phenomenon with periods of stability that vary from 3 to 10 years. Current
evidence indicates that PPS is the evolution of a subclinically ongoing motor
neuron dysfunction that begins after the time of the acute polio. It is
clinically manifested as PPS when the well-compensated reinnervating process
crosses a critical threshold beyond which the remaining motor neurons cannot
maintain the innervation to all the muscle fibers within their motor unit
territory. [References: 63] <p>

Title:  Expression of poliovirus receptor in human spinal cord and muscle.<p>
Source Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.  753:48-57, 1995 May 25.<p>
Abstract:  Because a prerequisite for infection of a cell with the poliovirus
is the presence of poliovirus receptor (PVR), we examined its tissue
localization in the human muscle, spinal cord, and muscle cultures using a
specific monoclonal antibody against PVR in immunocytochemical studies on
serial sections. We found weak expression of PVR in the motor neurons but not
the axons. In normal muscle, PVR was expressed at the end plate as confirmed by
immunolocalization in serial sections with alpha-bungarotoxin. In neurogenic
conditions and in myopathies, PVR was found in occasional denervated muscle
fibers and in several regenerating ones. Human myotubes expressed PVR and were
susceptible to the poliovirus infection. We conclude that PVR is present at the
motor end-plate that can serve as one of the routes of entry of the virus to
the motor neurons. The presence of PVR in the regenerating muscle fibers is in
accord with clinical observations that muscle injuries can predispose patients
to paralytic poliomyelitis. <p>

Title:  Role of poliovirus receptors in the spread of the infection.<p>
Source Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.  753:37-47, 1995 May 25.<p>
Abstract:  Although the poliovirus receptor (PVR) has been cloned, lack of
knowledge of its precise tissue distribution makes assessment of its role in
mediating poliomyelitis difficult. Our recent work demonstrated that PVR is
expressed on human monocytes and that primary human blood cells can support PV
replication. In the current work, we demonstrate that CD14-positive cells
(monocytes) support PV replication but that only a minority (&lt; 10%) of the
cells become infected. In other preliminary studies, immunocytochemical
analyses of human brain tissue demonstrated the presence of PVR in the
olfactory bulb, a tissue thought to not support PV replication. Thus, it
appears that some apparently "ectopic" sites of PVR expression may in fact be
sites for PV replication, whereas other sites may indeed be restricted. The
ability of monocytes to replicate PV may pertain to some unexplained phenomena
in PV pathogenesis, such as the specific cell type carrying out the initial
round of replication in the gut, sites of extraneural replication and transport
of the virus into the CNS. Preliminary studies with monocytes from post-polio
syndrome patients showed no difference in the levels of PVR relative to control
monocytes. In other preliminary work, PVR was shown to be phosphorylated and
its expression on monocytes increased by treatment with gamma-interferon. The
normal function of PVR is likely to be involved in monocyte function during
immune activation. <p>

Source Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.  753:343-53, 1995 May 25.<p>
Abstract:  A need exists for an objective classification of polio patients for
clinical and research purposes that takes into account the focal, asymmetric,
and frequent subclinical nature of polio lesions. In order to prescribe a safe,
effective exercise program, we developed a five-level (Classes I-V)
limb-specific classification system based on remote and recent history,
physical examination, and a four-extremity electrodiagnostic study (EMG/NCS).
Class I limbs have no history of remote or recent weakness, normal strength,
and a normal EMG. Class II limbs have no history of remote or recent weakness
(or if remote history of weakness, full recovery occurred), normal strength and
EMG evidence of prior anterior horn cell disease (AHCD). Class III limbs have a
history of remote weakness with variable recovery, no new weakness, decreased
strength, and EMG evidence of prior AHCD. Class IV limbs have a history of
remote weakness with variable recovery, new clinical weakness, decreased
strength, and EMG evidence of AHCD. Class V limbs have a history of severe
weakness with little-to-no recovery, severely decreased strength and atrophy,
and few-to-no motor units on EMG. In a prospective study of 400 limbs in 100
consecutive post-polio patients attending our clinic, 94 (23%) limbs were Class
I, 88 (22%) were Class II, 95 (24%) were Class III, 75 (19%) were Class IV, and
48 (12%) were Class V. Guidelines for the use of this classification in a
clinical/research setting are presented along with sample case histories and
class-specific exercise recommendations. <p>

Title:  How to design a therapeutic study in patients with the post-polio
syndrome. Methodological concerns and status of present therapies.<p>
Source Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.  753:314-20, 1995 May 25.<p>
Abstract:  The innervation of muscles in patients with the post-polio syndrome
(PPS) may differ from limb to limb or even within the same limb because of the
segmental nature of the initial involvement and the varying degree of
subsequent recovery. Consequently, the compensatory effort of the neighboring
muscles varies even in the same limb. Clinicohistological studies have
confirmed that in PPS the various muscle groups differ according to whether
they were affected during the acute polio and have recovered (partially or
completely), or whether they were clinically spared during the original
disease, in spite of subclinical involvement. Because the impact of the late
effects of polio is also variable in these muscle groups, the effect of
therapies may be different not only from patient to patient and from limb to
limb, but also from muscle to muscle within the same limb. These variables
require careful statistical determination of the sample size at the design of a
trial. Another problematic issue in the therapy of PPS is to define the end
point of therapy. The two disabling PPS symptoms, excessive fatigue and new
muscle weakness, can coexist. An experimental therapeutic design must focus
separately on the fatigue, using validated fatigue scales, and on muscle
weakness, using quantitative muscle testing. Another methodological concern is
the placebo-controlled design. Patients with PPS, even those without
depression, can be prone to a placebo effect; hence the need for controlled
trials. Finally, the length of a trial remains unresolved because of the slow
and unpredictable progression of PPS that varies from patient to patient. Until
the natural history of PPS is defined, therapies aimed at arresting disease
progression are not reliable. <p>

Abstract:  Because amantadine has been shown to reduce fatigue in patients with
multiple sclerosis, we performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
assess its efficacy in the disabling symptom of post-polio fatigue.
Twenty-three patients completed six weeks of therapy. Fatigue was measured by
the patients using visual analogue scales (twice per day) and numerical fatigue
severity scales (once per week) and by overall impression (at end of therapy).
Formal neuropsychological testing and serum drug levels were performed to
assess compliance. On all measures, no significant difference was found between
treatment and placebo groups. Fifty-four percent of patients given amantadine
and 43% given placebo reported a decrease in fatigue; however, the visual
analogue scales and fatigue severity scales failed to reflect any improvement.
Several patients in the treatment group elected to continue amantadine therapy
after the study was completed. Our findings suggest that amantadine is not
significantly better than placebo in reducing the sensation of fatigue in
post-polio syndrome, and that the measures we employed were insensitive to
capture the subjective response experienced by a few patients. <p>

survivors.<p>
Source Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.  753:276-84, 1995 May 25.<p>
Abstract:  In the later years of life, many polio survivors develop post-polio
syndrome manifested by progressive muscular weakness. Previous work by the
authors showed low IGF-I level in polio survivors compared to age-matched
controls. IGF-I concentration tended to be lower in polio survivors who were
older, male, obese, and also in persons experiencing difficulty in the
activities of daily living which were independent of other factors. IGF-I
levels did not correlate with the subjective report of recent decline in
functional status. Further studies of nocturnal GH secretion indicated that low
IGF-I level was secondary to impaired growth hormone secretion. Low IGF-I
levels in subjects with post-polio syndrome were corrected by physiologic doses
of hGH and the response was dose dependent. Lesser dosage was required to
normalize IGF-I level compared to standard dosages previously used in younger
persons. Inasmuch as low IGF-I level resulting from GH deficiency is known to
be associated with weakness, muscle atrophy, and decrease in aerobic work
capacity, it is postulated that low IGF-I levels that occur in aging polio
survivors may have an adverse effect on their neuromuscular function, and that
hGH replacement may improve their functional status. Moreover, the new
dose-response data may decrease the frequency of side effects in future hGH
treatment of older adults. <p>

[Review] [39 refs]<p>

Abstract:  Because polio and ALS are both manifestations of anterior horn cell
disease, consideration of some etiologic or pathogenetic relationship continues
to recur. Studies that show an association are infrequent and are greatly
outnumbered by negative reports in spite of possible journal bias to report
positive results. Our limited studies in Guam and Rochester, Minnesota, have
added to the negative list, and support the conclusion that there is no
etiologic association of these two distinct diseases. The role, if any, of
nonparalytic polio and polio vaccines with respect to ALS is not clear. With
such a high proportion of the population having antibodies to polio, it may not
be feasible to differentiate ALS with respect to the presence or absence of
polio antibodies. Although the results to date do not support a polio-ALS
relationship, further long-term studies are desirable for both the classical
and the Western Pacific forms of ALS with respect to past polio outbreaks and,
for the future, the unknown effect of polio vaccines on the incidence of ALS.

system in patients with previous paralytic poliomyelitis.<p>
Source Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.  753:219-32, 1995 May 25.<p>
Abstract:  It has been suggested that late onset neurological deterioration
after poliomyelitis may be due in some cases to persistent poliovirus infection
of the central nervous system. In view of this, we decide to determine whether
polioviruses and other enteroviruses can persist in the central nervous system.
In a previous study, one of us (M.K.S.) reported serological evidence of
persistent poliovirus infection of the central nervous system (CNS) in a
proportion of these patients. We have now studied cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
from these patients for the presence of enterovirus RNA sequences using the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Enteroviral RNA was detected in 3 of 24
patients with a clinical diagnosis of post-polio syndrome, but in none of 36
patients with stable poliomyelitis, and none of 36 patients with other
neurological conditions of noninfective origin. All 3 patients in whom viral
RNA was detected had high intrathecal levels of poliovirus-specific oligoclonal
IgM bands. In a second study we examined formalin-fixed postmortem CNS tissue
from 7 patients with a history of paralytic poliomyelitis. Enterovirus RNA was
detected in tissue from the spinal cord from 3 patients, but not in the
cerebral cortex. We are now conducting a larger prospective, blind study of
patients with evidence of late deterioration. Analysis of the first 30 patients
studied revealed the presence of enterovirus RNA in CSF of 1 of 4 patients with
unexplained late-onset post-polio weakness, 1 of 6 with some evidence of
clinical deterioration, but none of 20 without inexplicable signs of post-polio
weakness. Enteroviral RNA was also detected in spinal cord from 2 of 3 patients
who died from other causes during this study. These studies provide virological
evidence that enteroviruses may persist in the CNS of man. Further study is
required in order to understand fully the biological and clinical significance
of these findings. <p>

Abstract:  To investigate the role of poliovirus (PV) infection in the
development of the post-polio syndrome (PPS), we studied the serum, spinal
fluid, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and muscle from 47 patients with PPS. We
found high titers of IgM PV antibodies (up to 1:250) in the serum of 6
patients, compared to very low titers (less than 1:50) in normal subjects or
disease controls. By polymerase chain reaction, using primers of the replicase
PV gene, we amplified PV sequences in the peripheral blood lymphocytes in 7 of
37 patients and in the CSF in 4 of 40 patients, but in none of the controls.
Sequencing of the amplified product confirmed that it belonged to PV type 1
with a 99.3% homology. We conclude that some patients with PPS have in the
serum high titers of IgM anti-PV antibodies, implying an ongoing antibody
response to a viral antigen. The presence of PV-RNA in the CSF or lymphocytes
suggests possible persistence of mutated virus or defective PV particles. The
significance of these findings in the pathogenesis of PPS remains to be
determined. <p>

Abstract:  To understand the mechanism of post-poliomyelitis muscular atrophy

studies: (1) histopathology in spinal cord sections from patients who died 9
days to 44 years after acute paralytic poliomyelitis; (2) enzyme
histochemistry, immunocytochemistry (for lymphocyte subsets, MHC antigens and
N-CAM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for poliovirus RNA in the muscle
biopsies from symptomatic or asymptomatic muscles of post-polio patients; (3)
determination of lymphocyte subsets and circulating IgG or IgM antibodies
against GM1 and poliovirus; (4) virological studies in the spinal fluid for
oligoclonal bands and search for poliovirus genome with PCR; (5)
electrophysiological studies including single fiber EMG, fiber density and
macro-EMG; and (6) [31P] exercise MRS spectroscopy on previously affected
muscles to search for a metabolic correlate of fatigue. These studies concluded
that in PPS a continuing dysfunction is present in the spinal cord motor
neurons, resulting in ongoing muscle denervation and reinnervation first
evident at the axonal branch points. Symptoms are related to attrition of the
oversprouting motor neurons which after a period of time cannot support all
their axonal sprouts, resulting in failure of re-reinnervation. In some
patients with PPS there is also an ongoing immune activation and presence of
defective viral particles in the spinal fluid. However, their role in the
pathogenesis of PPS is presently unknown. [References: 65] <p>

syndrome.<p>

Abstract:  We performed a detailed morphological and electrophysiological
analysis of the neuromuscular junction in muscle biopsies from 10 patients with
post-polio syndrome (PPS). This was done to clarify the basis for the apparent
neuromuscular transmission impairment in PPS. In six patients, intracellular
microelectrode recordings demonstrated either reduction of amplitudes of
miniature end-plate potentials (MEPPs) or decreased quantal content or both. In
one patient, reduction of quantal content was only present with prolonged or
high-frequency nerve stimulation. In three patients no significant
abnormalities were found by the intracellular microelectrode studies.
Histologically, atrophy of individual muscle fibers were present in 6 out of
the 10 biopsies, but grouped atrophy was not seen. Fiber type grouping
suggesting reinnervation was seen in 8 out of the 10 muscle biopsies.
Fragmentation and dispersion of the end plate was present in three patients. In
two of these patients dispersion of the end plate was associated with an
apparent increase of the quantal content. Electron microscopy revealed either
normal neuromuscular junctions or small axon termini apposed to normal
postsynaptic folds. In summary, variable degrees and different types of failure
of neuromuscular transmission were seen in association with histological signs
of reinnervation in the muscle biopsies of affected patients. Functional and
structural abnormalities of the neuromuscular junction, although very common,
were not invariably present and, therefore, they do not appear to be a
necessary condition to define the post-poliomyelitic syndrome. <p>

the effect of expiratory positive airway pressure.<p>
Source European Respiratory Journal.  8(3):436-40, 1995 Mar.<p>
Abstract:  Increasing expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) has
theoretical advantages during overnight nasal ventilation. We wanted to
evaluate the effect of the addition of EPAP upon the control of nocturnal
hypoventilation. Seven patients with neuromuscular/skeletal (NMS) disorder
(mean +/- SD forced vital capacity (FVC) 1.06 +/- 0.28 l, arterial oxygen
tension (PaO2) 9.1 +/- 0.6 kPa, and arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) 6.9
+/- 0.9 kPa), and seven patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) (FEV1 0.46 +/- 0.14 l, PaO2 6.2 +/- 0.6 kPa, and PaCO2 8.4 +/- 1.1 kPa)
all underwent full polysomnography on two nights during bilevel positive airway
pressure (BiPAP) ventilation, with and without the addition of expiratory
positive airway pressure, which was matched to the level of dynamic positive
end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or set at a minimum value of 5 cmH2O. In the
group with neuromuscular/skeletal disorders the maximum transcutaneous carbon
dioxide tension (PtcCO2) overnight was lower (inspiratory positive airway
pressure (IPAP) 8.1 +/- 1.4 kPa, IPAP/EPAP 7.3 +/- 0.9 kPa) and the minimum
level of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2 min) increased (IPAP 77.1 +/- 6.7%,
IPAP/EPAP 83.6 +/- 4.2%) when expiratory positive airway pressure was added.
There were no differences in mean PtcCO2 or mean oxygen saturation, but sleep
quality was worse (non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep IPAP 266 +/- 44 min,
IPAP/EPAP 226 +/- 32 min). In the patients with COPD, expiratory positive
airway pressure conferred no advantage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) <p>

Abstract:  Postpolio syndrome is a sequela of paralytic poliomyelitis seen in
approximately 25% of polio victims. Because the symptoms are nonspecific, it
can be difficult to diagnose. Getting information about diagnosis and treatment
of unusual conditions in rural and remote regions can be difficult, and
physicians sometimes find themselves in the position of being the on-site
"expert." Physicians must make difficult decisions with patients and their
families about life-giving therapies, advance directives, and the like.

Title:  Fibromyalgia is common in a postpoliomyelitis clinic.<p>
Source Archives of Neurology.  52(6):620-4, 1995 Jun.<p>
Abstract:  OBJECTIVE: To determine prospectively the occurrence and clinical
characteristics of fibromyalgia in patients serially presenting to a postpolio
clinic. Fibromyalgia may mimic some of the symptoms of postpoliomyelitis
syndrome, a disorder characterized by new weakness, fatigue, and pain decades
after paralytic poliomyelitis. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: A
university-affiliated hospital clinic. PATIENTS: One hundred five patients were
evaluated with a standardized history and physical examination during an
18-month period. Ten patients were excluded because of the absence of past
paralytic poliomyelitis. INTERVENTIONS: Patients with fibromyalgia were treated
with low-dose, nighttime amitriptyline hydrochloride or other conservative
measures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients with fibromyalgia had diffuse pain
and 11 or more of 18 specific tender points on examination (American College of
Rheumatology criteria, 1990). Patients with borderline fibromyalgia had muscle
pain and five to 10 tender points on physical examination. RESULTS: Ten (10.5%)
of 95 postpolio patients met the criteria for fibromyalgia, and another 10
patients had borderline fibromyalgia. All patients with fibromyalgia complained
of new weakness, fatigue, and pain. Patients with fibromyalgia were more likely
than patients without fibromyalgia to be female (80% vs 40%, P &lt; .04) and to
complain of generalized fatigue (100% vs 71%, P = .057), but were not
distinguishable in terms of age at presentation to clinic, age at polio, length
of time since polio, physical activity, weakness at polio, motor strength
scores on examination, and the presence of new weakness, muscle fatigue, or
joint pain. Approximately 50% of patients in both the fibromyalgia and
borderline fibromyalgia groups responded to low-dose, nighttime amitriptyline
therapy. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Fibromyalgia occurs frequently in a postpolio clinic.
(2) Fibromyalgia can mimic some symptoms of postpoliomyelitis syndrome. (3)
Fibromyalgia in postpolio patients can respond to specific treatment. <p>

Abstract:  A crossectional study was conducted to assess the prevalence of late
symptoms among post-polio survivors. The aim was to increase awareness of late
symptoms among professionals involved in rehabilitation, and to evaluate the
need for accessible diagnostic and treatment facilities. Of the 146 subjects
surveyed, about half reported decline in general health since maximal recovery.
Among the late symptoms were muscle and joint pain (46%), fatigue (31%), cold
intolerance (67%) and muscle cramps (39%). About 25% reported decreased
functional ability and 13% required braces or mobility devices. Most of the
late symptoms appeared gradually (median time 45 years after onset of polio).
The prevalence of these late symptoms is slightly lower than that described in
previous studies, but that of decreased functional ability, much lower. These
differences may be due to differences in the populations surveyed. Symptomatic
post-polio subjects should be identified and encouraged to use appropriate
medical facilities. <p>

Title:  Multiple sclerosis presenting as late functional deterioration after
poliomyelitis.<p>
Source Postgraduate Medical Journal.  71(831):52-4, 1995 Jan.<p>
Abstract:  We describe five patients with previous poliomyelitis who developed
multiple sclerosis (two laboratory supported definite and three clinically
definite). The initial symptoms of functional deterioration developed a mean of
30 years following poliomyelitis. Initial functional deterioration was due to
progressive limb weakness or impaired mobility and in three cases this led to
an initial diagnosis of post-polio muscular atrophy. The clinical diagnosis
became apparent with the subsequent development of characteristic clinical
features, including optic nerve, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord
involvement. The occurrence of multiple sclerosis in these patients emphasises
that late functional deterioration may be apparently unrelated to previous
poliomyelitis. Furthermore, characteristic clinical features may be masked by
the severe pre-existing neuromuscular and orthopaedic impairment leading to
diagnostic delay and confusion with the ill-defined clinical syndrome of
progressive post-polio muscular atrophy. <p>

Abstract:  Pulmonary rehabilitation strives to relieve symptoms, improve
functional status, and enhance quality of life for patients with pulmonary
disease. This article describes the condition called postpolio syndrome and its
associated pulmonary complications. Forty-two percent of the respondents to a
national survey on the late effects of polio were experiencing new problems
related to breathing. Pulmonary rehabilitation, originally developed to address
functional impairment and disability related to chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, can benefit patients with postpolio syndrome. A case study is
presented. <p>

Abstract:  Of the 250,000 survivors of the polio epidemics, approximately 25%
experience progressive muscle weakness known as postpolio syndrome (PPS).
Laryngeal function in postpolio patients previously has not been studied. This
paper presents data detailing laryngeal function in a group of postpolio
patients who had been evaluated for swallowing complaints. Nine patients
underwent comprehensive history and physical exam, acoustical voice analysis,
and laryngeal videostroboscopic endoscopy. Three patients underwent laryngeal
electromyography (EMG) evaluation. Results indicated some degree of phonatory
or laryngeal deficit in all subjects. Subjects with dysphagia also demonstrated
vocal fold paralysis. EMG revealed decreased recruitment and increased
amplitude, findings consistent with EMG studies in skeletal muscle in postpolio
patients. Results suggest that postpolio patients who complain of swallowing
difficulties are at risk for laryngeal pathology. <p>

Abstract:  A severe left-sided cervical radiculopathy that developed after a
work-related injury is reported. Because this involved the upper limb opposite
to a long-standing postpolio sequela, it is suggestive of postpolio syndrome.
Work-up showed left-sided multilevel acquired foraminal stenosis. These
unilateral degenerative changes were very likely the result of overuse of the
cervical apophyseal joints, the consequence of the muscle imbalance created by
the poliomyelitis. It was successfully treated by appropriate surgical
decompression. <p>
