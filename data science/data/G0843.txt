<H2>Simulated Microwave Background Anisotropy Maps</H2><P>

Microwave background anisotropy (fluctuations) is a natural
outcome of physical processes in the early universe.  Starting
with super-large-scale fluctuations in the energy density or
entropy, gravity and pressure forces lead to acoustic oscillations
in the photon-baryon plasma.  ("Baryon" refers to one of the ordinary
atoms in the universe; these are mostly hydrogen and helium.)
Until about 200,000 years after the big bang, the hydrogen in
the universe was fully ionized, resulting in a high Thomson opacity.
In other words,the plasma was opaque, like the interior of the sun.
About 200,000 years after the big bang, when the temperature decreased
to about 3000 Kelvin, the electrons and protons joined to make neutral
hydrogen, a colorless, transparent gas.  Looking out in space in the
microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum, we look back in time
to when this "recombination" took place.  What we see are the
fluctuations in microwave background intensity shown in the
<A HREF="cobe.html"> COBE maps</A>. <P>

Starting from a "spectrum" of primeval fluctuations, and a model for
the contents and evolution of the universe, we can simulate on a
computer the processes that generated the cosmic microwave background
anisotropy.  The maps shown below are based on calculations performed
by Paul Bode and Edmund Bertschinger on massively parallel supercomputers.
In all cases, the level of fluctuations has been set to match the COBE
quadrupole anisotropy, Qrms-PS=20 micro-Kelvin.  Deep blue and red colors
represent Delta_T = +/-200 micro-Kelvin.  Remarkably, for models similar
to standard cold dark matter, the observed level of anisotropy is about
what is needed to account for the formation of large-scale structure by
gravitational instability.  (Given the difficulty of testing theories,
cosmologists argue, sometimes loudly, about whether this rough agreement
is good or bad!)

This map shows a simulated microwave background sky with angular
resolution 0.5 degrees, 20 times sharper than the COBE maps shown
on the <A HREF="cobe.html">preceding page</A>.  The cosmological
model is standard cold dark matter (CDM), with mass fractions in
CDM and baryons of Omega_c=0.95 and Omega_b=0.05, respectively.
The Hubble constant was assumed to be 50 km/s/Mpc, against the
better wisdom of our observational colleagues.  This model assumes
primeval isentropic fluctuations in the energy density with a
scale-invariant (n=1) spectrum, as would (almost) be produced by
primeval cosmic inflation.  The computations were performed on
the IBM SP-2 at the
<A HREF="http://www.tc.cornell.edu/">Cornell Theory Center</A>.
5000 wavenumbers and up to 10000 multipole moments were used,
in a full calculation of linearized general relativity carried out
to the present day.

Can you see any differences with the map of standard CDM?  They are very
slight!  In this case, we have converted 20% of the cosmic mean density
from cold dark matter to massive neutrinos of rest mass energy 4.7
electron-Volts.  The thermal motions of massive neutrinos reduces the
level of matter fluctuations, paradoxically increasing the level of
microwave background fluctuations because the resulting changes in the
gravitational potential change the photon energies.  However, the
differences in the two maps are only a few percent.  For the experts,
there is one other difference in the two maps.  The CDM computations
were performed in the conformal Newtonian (longitudinal) gauge, while
the MDM computations were performed using synchronous gauge.  It is
comforting to see that the physical results are gauge-invariant.
The computations were performed on the Cray T3D at the
