ERRORS in the CHRONOMETRIC COSMOLOGY: CMB, Source Counts, and Redshifts
</H1>

<H2>
I. CMB
</H2>

<P>
The chronometric cosmology proposed by Segal is incompatible with the cosmic
microwave background (CMB).  Segal predicts an angular size distance
</P>
 
<PRE>
D_A(z) = X/theta = R*sin(chi) = 2*R*sqrt(z)/(1+z),
</PRE>
 
<P>
where X is the physical size of an object, theta is the apparent angular size,
[I will assume that theta &lt;&lt; 1 radian and approximate sin and tan 
of theta]
chi is an angle measuring distance around the spherical geometry of the
chronometric cosmology, and R is the physical radius of the Universe in the
chronometric model.  The redshift is given by
 
<PRE>
z = tan^2(chi/2)
</PRE>
 
<P>
and the luminosity distance is given by
</P>
 
<PRE>
D_L(z) = sqrt[L(bol)/(4*pi*F(bol))] = sqrt(1+z)*D_A(z) = 2*R*sqrt(z/(1+z)).
</PRE>
 
<P>
Note that bolometric fluxes are integrated over all frequencies and have
units of Watts/meter^2, and L(bol) is the total luminosity with units of
Watts.
</P>

<P>
Now a blackbody (any opaque isothermal object) with temperature T and 
radius X has a luminosity L(bol) = 4*pi*X^2*sigma*T^4 where sigma is the 
Stefan-Boltzmann constant.  The peak frequency of the spectrum is 
f(pk) = A*T/h, where A is close to 2.82 times Boltzmann's constant and 
h is Planck's constant.  For a nearby source (z << 1), the relationship 
between the flux F(bol), angular radius theta, and temperature T is
</P>

<PRE>
F(bol) = L(bol)/(4*pi*D^2) = [4*pi*X^2*sigma*T^4]/(4*pi*D^2)
       = theta^2*sigma*T^4 = theta^2*sigma*[h*f(pk)/A]^4
</PRE>

<P>
The observed quantities F(bol), f(pk) and theta have to satisfy this
relationship for an object to appear to be a blackbody.  Now consider
a distant blackbody with redshift z.  The peak frequency is shifted to
</P>

<P>
f(pk) = (A*T/h)/(1+z), and
</P>

<PRE>
F(bol) = L(bol)/(4*pi*D_L(z)^2) = [4*pi*X^2*sigma*T^4]/(4*pi*D_L(z)^2)
       = theta^2 * [D_A(z)/D_L(z)]^2 * sigma * (1+z)^4 * [h*f(pk)/A]^4
</PRE>

<P>
In all respectable cosmological models, D_L(z) = (1+z)^2*D_A(z) so a
redshifted blackbody looks like a blackbody.  In Segal's chronometric
cosmology, this is NOT true, D_L(z) = sqrt(1+z)*D_A(z), and
</P>

<PRE>
F(bol) = (1+z)^3 * theta^2*sigma*[h*f(pk)/A]^4
</PRE>

<P>
Thus by observing F(bol), f(pk) and theta for the cosmic microwave 
background one can determine the redshift at which the Universe becomes
opaque.  The FIRAS instrument on COBE adjusted the temperature of its
calibrator (a local blackbody) so its f(pk) exactly matched the f(pk)
of the CMB from the sky.  It then removed the calibrator from the horn
and looked at the sky to see if F(bol) changed.  The change was a 
factor of 1.00001 +/- 0.00005 (Fixsen etal 1996, ApJ, 473, 576): in other
words, NO change was seen, and an upper limit on the redshift at which
the Universe is opaque is (1+z)^3 &lt; 1.00001 + 3*0.00005, 
so z &lt; 0.00005.
Since quasars are observed at millimeter wavelengths (same as f(pk)
for the CMB) out to z = 4.7, the chronometric cosmology FAILS the CMB test.
</P>

<P>
Note that Segal will always try to wiggle out of the CMB problem by
stating that any theory that maximizes entropy while conserving energy
will give a Planck function.  But maximizing the entropy requires
interactions to scatter photons giving isotropy and to absorb and
re-emit photons, giving a Planck function once everything is isothermal.
But these interactions don't occur in a vacuum - the "grain of sand" in
the blackbody cavity is needed.  We know the local region of the Universe
(out to z = 4.7) is transparent and won't serve to create a blackbody.
Since Segal's theory is static and homogeneous, there is no place and no
time in the Universe that could have produced a blackbody.  
In Segal's book he assumes that the antipode (z = infinity) is the place
where photon directions and energies are mixed up, but he forgets that
everybody is somebody's antipode, so we should see this mixing locally.
He also calculates a CMB energy density that is 100 times too large but
doesn't care about this discrepancy.  What I have shown above is that even 
if there were a place to make the blackbody, the CMB would still disagree 
with the COBE data unless that place were closer than z = 0.00005.
</P>

<P>
However, the chronometric model is not the only incorrect CMB theory
from Segal.  Let me quote from p. 117 of the proceedings of IAU Symposium
104, "Early Evolution of the Universe and its Present Structure", 
G. O. Abell and G. Chincarini eds., (c) 1983 (Dordrecht: Reidel), a
discussion after papers presented by myself and Rowan-Robinson:
</P>

<P>
Segal - "The cosmic background radiation is, of course, not uniquely
indicative of a Big Bang, but a Planck law for the background 
photons is implied by any temporally homogeneous theory in which the
energy is modelled, as usual, by the infinitesimal time evolution
generator.  A very simply quasiphenomenological explanation of the Woody-
Richard anomaly is a postulated non-vanishing isotropic angular momentum
for the CBR in, for example, the vicinity of the Local Group.  This
provides a very good fit to their data, depends only on a single 
contemporary parameter rather than by hypothetical events at redshifts
such as 200 or 1000, and automatically displaces the pure black-body law
in the observed direction, rather than the opposite direction, as early
discussion of perturbations of a Big Bang predicted.  Therefore, isn't
this scientifically more economical and in principle empirically accessible
explanation of the Woody-Richards anomaly more natural than those presented
that require a complete scenario hardly capable, in principle, of
independent substantiation?"
</P>

<P>
Wright - "The Jakobsen, Kon and Segal model (1979, Physical Review Letters,
42, 1788, hereafter JKS) of the Woody and Richards (WR) spectrum has two
basic flaws.  The first flaw is that it does not fit the data if the low 
frequency results are included.  The Planck brightness temperature of the
JKS model is a nonincreasing function of the frequency, while the observed
data rises from 2.7 K at low frequencies to 3.0 K at the peak, then falls 
to 2.8 K on the high frequency side of the peak.  The JKS model matches the
WR spectrum at the peak and higher frequencies, but predicts 3.4 K at low
frequencies (see accompanying figure.)
<P>
	The second flaw in the JKS model is that the predicted background
is inhomogeneous and anisotropic (Wright, 1980, Physical Review D, 22, 2361).
The local perturbation just proposed by Segal is also manifestly 
inhomogeneous.  An inhomogeneous background violates the cosmological
principle, and is thus incompatible with all modern cosmological models,
including the chronometric cosmology of Segal."
</P>

<P>
This figure shows the JKS model fitting the Woody-Richards data (closed points)
but missing the ground-based data (open points).  The Woody-Richards distortion
in the CMB was shown to be incorrect years before COBE was launched.  The COBE
spectrum is shown by the horizontal line, with the +/- 2 sigma uncertainty
in the COBE data indicated by the width of the line.  Click here for a

<A HREF = "./jks.ps">Postscript</A> version.
</P>

<P>
This story indicates a number of factors.  One is that Segal always takes a
very complicated approach.  The other is that he is satisfied to fit a small
part of the data, and then does not check to see that his model is consistent
with all of the data.
</P>

<H2>
II. Source Counts
</H2>

<P>
When counting sources down to a flux limit S, one expects to see to a 
distance proportional to 1/sqrt(S), and hence to see a volume
proportional to 1/S^1.5.  Thus the number of sources brighter
than a flux limit S, N(>S), should follow the law N(>S) = const/S^1.5
in Euclidean space.  But the observed radio source and quasar counts 
are steeper than this law for medium to large S, giving an excess of 
moderately faint sources compared to the number of bright sources.  In 
Segal's book, he notes that the flux per unit frequency for a source 
with luminosity per unit frequency L(nu) = C/nu^a is given by
</P>

<PRE>
F(nu) = [L(nu)*(1+z)^{2-a}]/[16*pi*R^2*z]
</PRE>

<P>
This flux reaches a minimum value for z = 1/(1-a) when a is less than
1 as it usually is for radio sources.  There is an excess of sources
at fluxes close to the minimum flux, and Segal used this mechanism to
make a qualitative explanation for the radio source counts.
</P>

<P>
Wright (1987, ApJ, 313, 551) did the calculations to see whether a 
quantitative fit to the source counts was possible, and found that it was 
impossible to make a statistically acceptable fit to the source counts in 
the chronometric cosmology.  Wright introduced a source count excess ratio
</P>

<PRE>
E(S1,S2) = (S1/S2)^{1.5} N(&gt; S1)/N(&gt; S2)    for S1 &lt; S2
</PRE>

<P>
and showed that E &lt; 3*pi/2 in the chronometric cosmology, while the
observed quasar counts had E &gt; 17.  Thus while Segal can produce a
small excess of faint sources, he can not produce an excess that is
as large as the observed excess.
</P>

<P>
In Segal's reply to this paper (1987, ApJ, 320, 135) he claimed that
E could go to infinity in the chronometric cosmology in the limit
S2 goes to zero.  But since the flux S1 is positive, the limit
S2 goes to zero violates the condition S1 &lt; S2.  It is sad to see
that a math professor at MIT could have forgotten how to manipulate
inequalities.  I pointed out this error to Segal before his paper
was published, but he went ahead and published his incorrect results.
</P>

<H2>
III. Redshift-magnitude
</H2>

<P>
The most unusual prediction made by Segal is that the redshift
is a quadratic function of the distance, instead of the linear
Hubble law.  For z &lt;&lt; 1 Segal then predicts that the flux should follow
F = const/z, and since magnitudes are defined as m=Const-2.5*log(F),
Segal predicts that m = 2.5*log(z) + M, where M is the absolute
magnitude defined with a standard distance at z=1 instead of 10 pc.
The Hubble law predicts that m = 5*log(z) + M.  Soneira (1979, ApJL, 
230, L63) made a test of this prediction using the average redshift of 
galaxies in magnitude bins, which I will denote as &lt;z|m&gt; for the mean 
redshift at a given magnitude.  Soneira found m = 5*log(&lt;z|m&gt;) + CONST,
so Hubble was right.  Segal, however, likes to use the mean
magnitude in a redshift bin, &lt;m|z&gt;, and finds that
&lt;m|z&gt; = 2.5*log(z) + CONST.  How can this be?  It turns out that the
mean magnitude in a redshift bin is strongly biased by the
fact that galaxy samples are flux-limited.  Galaxies are not all
the same brightness, and in fact very faint dwarf galaxies are
much more common than luminous galaxies like M31.  In the observed
samples, the very faint galaxies (large m) are missing, and thus 
&lt;m|z&gt; is biased downward.  To study this bias one needs to know the 
relative number of faint versus luminous galaxies, known as the
luminosity function.  Schechter  (1976, ApJ, 203, 297) found a
luminosity function n(M) = const*10^{0.1*M}/exp(10^{0.4*(Ms-M)})
galaxies per unit volume per magnitude, using both field galaxies
(assuming the Hubble law) and clusters of galaxies where no assumption
about the redshift-magnitude law is needed.  Other workers have
found n(M) = const/exp(10^{0.4*(Ms-M)}) is a better fit.  Approximate
this as n(M) = const for M &gt; Ms, and zero for M &lt; Ms.  Then the
redshift-magnitude diagram will be populated with a density of
galaxies proportional to z^2*dz for bright(z) &lt; m &lt; faint, where
bright(z) = Ms + 5*log(z), and faint is the magnitude limit.  In defining
bright(z) I have assumed the Hubble law is correct.  I can now easily
find that &lt;m|z&gt; = (bright(z) + faint)/2 = 2.5*log(z) + (Ms+faint)/2.
Thus Segal's analysis technique will bias the results to fit his theory.
On the other hand Soneira's technique using &lt;z|m&gt; gives 
&lt;z|m&gt; = 0.75*10^{0.2*(m-Ms)}, so 5*log(&lt;z|m&gt;) = m + const.
Segal has since introduced a new statistical technique that he calls ROBUST,
but since the original claim of a quadratic redshift-distance law was due 
to a biased statistical technique, any method that agrees with the original
biased analysis is also flawed. 
</P>

<P>
I am fairly sure that the problem with ROBUST is caused by a gradual loss of 
completeness as the catalog limit is approached, but why should I bother to 
work this out?  Segal is wrong on the CMB, wrong on the source counts, and
wrong on the redshift-magnitude law.  Three strikes and you're out is the
popular criminal law these days, but in science it has always been ONE strike
and you're out.  That's why theorists invented free parameters, but the
chronometric theory doesn't have any parameters except for the scale
factor, so it makes very definite predictions which are WRONG.

This figure shows the &lt;m|z&gt;, &lt;z|m&gt; and all of the
magnitudes and redshifts for four
samples of galaxies: Sandage and Visvanathan (1978, ApJ, 223, 707),
Kirshner, Oemler and Schechter (1978, AJ, 83, 1549),
the galaxies NOT associated with quasars in Stockton (1978, ApJ, 223, 747),
and Koo (1982, in the proceedings of IAU Symposium 104).  The three panels
from top to bottom show all the galaxies, &lt;z|m&gt;, and 
&lt;m|z&gt;.  Note that
Segal's law definitely fits &lt;m|z&gt; for a SINGLE sample better than the
Hubble law does, but different zero points are needed for each sample.
This is expected because the different samples had different limiting
magnitudes, and the bias in &lt;m|z&gt; depends on the flux limit.
On the other hand, the Hubble law with a single zero point fits all the
&lt;z|m&gt; points well, 
and even gives a better overall fit to &lt;m|z&gt; when all
the samples are fitted simultaneously.
