<p>
During the past few decades, infrared astronomy has become a major field of 
science due to the rapid advances in infrared detector technology.  Many of
these advances arose from U.S Department of Defense research into infrared
array technology in the 1980's.

Infrared radiation, having longer wavelengths and lower energy than visible
light, does not have enough energy to interact with the photographic plates
which are used in visible light astronomy.  Instead infrared astronomers
rely on electronic devices to detect radiation.   Early infrared astronomers
used thermocouples and thermopiles (a group of thermocouples combined in
one cell).  
<p>
In the 1950's astronomers started to use Lead-sulphide (PbS) detectors       
to study infrared radiation in the 1 to 4 micron range.  When infrared
radiation 
in this range falls on a PbS cell it changes the resistance of the cell.
This change in resistance can be measured and is related to the amount of
infrared radiation which falls upon the cell.  To increase the sensitivity
of the PbS cell it was cooled to a temperature of 77 degrees Kelvin
by placing it in a flask filled with liquid nitrogen.

A major breakthrough came in 1961, with the development of the germanium
bolometer.
This instrument was hundreds of times more sensitive than previous detectors
and was capable of detecting all infrared wavelengths.
Basically, a cool thin strip of germanium is placed in a container which has
a small opening in it.  When infrared radiation comes through the opening
and hits the germanium, it warms the metal and changes its conductivity
(a measure of how much electrical current flows through an object).  The
change in conductivity can be measured and is directly proportional to the
amount of infrared radiation entering the container.                         
The germanium bolometer works best at an extremely low temperature
(much lower than liquid nitrogen).
The best way to cool the bolometer to such a low temperature 
is to surround it with liquid helium which cooled it to 4 degrees Kelvin. 
This is only a few degrees above absolute zero.  To do 
this a metal Dewar (similar to a well insulated thermos
flask) was developed which was able to
hold the liquid helium in which the germanium bolometer was immersed.         
This type of infrared detector is sensitive to the entire range of infrared
wavelengths.  To study a particular wavelength of infrared emission
from astronomical objects, astronomers place filters in front of the detectors,
which filter out all but the desired wavelengths.

Infrared detector technology continues to advance at a rapid rate.  
Astronomers now use InSb and HgCdTe detectors for the 1 to 5 micron range.
These operate in a way similar to the PbS detectors but use materials which
are much more sensitive to the infrared.
The development of infrared array detectors in the 1980's caused another
giant leap in the sensitivity of infrared observations.                     
Basically a detector array is a combination of several single detectors.
These arrays allow astronomers to produce images containing tens of thousands
of pixels at the same time.  Infrared arrays have been used on several
infrared satellite missions.  In 1983 the IRAS mission used an array of
62 detectors.  Astronomers now commonly use 256x256 arrays (thats 65,536
detectors!). 

Due to these 
breakthroughs in infrared technology, infrared astronomy has developed
more rapidly than any other field of astronomy and continues to bring us
exciting new views of the universe.
