<h3>Undergraduate studies at EPFL</h3>

<p>I have grown up in the french-speaking part of <a
href="http://heiwww.unige.ch/switzerland/">Switzerland</a>, more
specifically in the <a href="http://www.lausanne.ch/">Lausanne</a>
area, which is located in the <a href="http://www.vd.ch/">Canton
de Vaud</a>. I have graduated in January 1992 in <a
href="http://dewww.epfl.ch/">Electrical Engineering</a> at <a
href="http://www.epfl.ch/">EPFL</a> (french acronym meaning
&quot;Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne&quot;).
My thesis (&quot;projet de diplôme&quot;) was about implementing
a particular type of neural network, called <a
href="http://cochlea.hut.fi/nnrc/teuvo.html"><em>Kohonen network</em></a>
or <em>Self-Organizing Feature Map</em>, as an analog CMOS
integrated circuit. My advisor was <a
href="http://diwww.epfl.ch/w3lami/team/vschaik/avp/evi.html">Prof.
Eric Vittoz</a>. This work has been <a
href="publica.htm#Neural networks">published</a>.</p>

<h3>Research and development job at CSEM</h3>

alt="fuzzy logic chip picture" align="right" border="0"
hspace="6" vspace="6" width="200" height="187"></a>I have been
hired in March 1992 as an R&amp;D engineer by a company called <a
href="http://www.csem.ch/">CSEM</a>, located in <a
href="http://www.nenet.ch/">Neuchâtel</a>, Switzerland. There, I
joined a team called &quot;Advanced Research Group&quot;, led by
Prof. Eric Vittoz (the same as above: he has two jobs). This
group was focused on implementing neural networks and visual
perception on analog VLSI hardware. My own project from 1992 to
1994 consisted of designing <a href="images/el102.jpg">fuzzy
logic controllers</a> in analog VLSI. My primary interest in this
field was to make fuzzy rule circuits as compact and low power as
possible. I ended up with a fully parallel, continuous time chip
with 60 rules/mm2 and submicrowatt power consumption in a 2um
CMOS technology. This chip was <a href="publica.htm#Fuzzy logic">published</a>
at MicroNeuro'96.</p>

<p>Toward the end of 1994, I adopted a new perspective on fuzzy
logic hardware. It occured to me that the representation of data
after the &quot;fuzzification&quot; stage of classical fuzzy
controllers actually resembles population coding as found in
biological neural structures. I suspected that it should be
possible to implement computation based on fuzzy logic operators
without the burden of converting back and forth between
&quot;crisp&quot; (non fuzzy) representations and fuzzy
representations. Since I was considering writing a Ph.D. thesis
around this time, I selected this idea as a topic. I defined a
representation of data called <em>place coding</em> (related to
biological population coding), and figured out how to build
circuits that carry out useful computation based on this
representation. Some time in 1995, I registered at <a
href="http://www.epfl.ch/">EPFL</a> as a graduate student,
although I did not leave my job at CSEM (in Switzerland, graduate
students are not requested to follow any lectures, therefore it
is possible to carry out research outside of a university and
still get a Ph.D. for it).</p>

<p><a href="images/eye_muscles.gif"><img
src="images/eye_muscles_s.gif" alt="eye muscles" align="left"
border="0" hspace="6" vspace="6" width="247" height="150"></a>At
the beginning of 1995, I have started a new project aiming at
building an <a href="images/oculomot.jpg"><em>oculo-motor system</em></a>,
i.e. a device having essentially the functionality of a <a
href="images/eye_muscles.gif">moving eye</a>. For a number of
years already, other people at CSEM and elsewhere had been
working on building electronic retina chips and visual processing
hardware, but these chips lacked the ability of moving their
field of view as most animals do. A team of people led by myself,
including Patrick Debergh, Friedrich Heitger, Stève Gyger and
many other CSEM engineers, built a device based on <a
href="images/microprism.jpg">micro-prism gratings</a> capable of
deflecting the field of view of an underlying image sensor,
together with an electronic control system relying heavily on
neuromorphic analog VLSI chips. My own contribution to the
project was essentially the design of these chips. Since the
control of the <a href="images/microprism.jpg">micro-prism
gratings</a> involved heavily non-linear mappings between the
visual and the motor space, this project provided a perfect
opportunity to apply my ideas on place coding and demonstrate
that it actually works. Therefore, much of the <a
href="images/oculomot.jpg">oculo-motor system</a> is described in
my Ph.D. thesis, an extended version of which has been published
as a <a href="publica.htm#Place coding">book</a>.</p>

<p>At some point, CSEM was reorganized into different units,
whereby most of the integrated circuits design center became a
spin-off called <a href="http://www.xemics.ch/">Xemics</a>. The
neuromorphic engineering unit was renamed &quot;Bio-Inspired
Systems Section&quot; and remained part of CSEM within a new unit
called &quot;Advanced Microelectronics Division&quot; led by Eric
Vittoz. Around this time, responsibility for the Bio-Inspired
Systems Section was taken over by Friedrich Heitger, and I was
promoted Project Manager.</p>

alt="saccadic chip" align="left" border="0" hspace="6" vspace="6"
width="250" height="139"></a>The &quot;oculo-motor project&quot;
has been running until I left CSEM (December 1998), and work is
still going on under the responsibility of Stève Gyger as I
write these lines. By the end of 1998, our &quot;moving eye&quot;
was able to explore the visual field in quick jumps called <em>saccades</em>,
while spending most time and returning most frequently to the
most interesting places. The degree of interest - or <em>saliency</em>
- of an area in the visual field was simply determined by light
intensity, therefore our eye was interested chiefly in bright
areas. Another functionality of our system was to track light
spots, i.e. it would keep a light spot centered on its retina,
even if the spot moves around in the visual field. The first
improvement Stève plans to make to this system consists of
getting it to operate on &quot;natural&quot; visual scenes,
instead of scenes made of light spots only. Stève, myself and
others plan to work on this topic at the <a
href="http://www.ini.unizh.ch:80/telluride99/">Telluride Workshop
on Neuromorphic Engineering</a> in July 1999.</p>
