<IMG SRC="images/back.gif" ALIGN="right" WIDTH="82" HEIGHT="99">The fifty scientists, engineers, and economists who attended the Santa Fe
Institute's recent Business Network for Complex Systems Research meeting were
more interested in manufacturing, microprocessors, and novel economic modeling
than in the origin of new species. But they all were interested in gaining
something Charles Darwin said successful species have in common: an adaptive or
competitive edge. Most of the meeting participants were more than willing to
entertain the SFI notion that biological systems, built upon a simple
nucleic-acid alphabet and layered with features of self-organization and
complexity, just might offer practical lessons for business. Why not use the
incredible, multilayered sophistication of the mammalian immune system as a model
for computer-virus detection and better computer security? 
<P> The Business
Network meeting was the Institute's sixth. It comes at a time when complexity
research has grown in stature to both attract critics as well as proponents armed
with ample evidence that conventional economic theory, for example, fails to
predict either the direction or magnitude of U.S. interest-rate swings. Institute
President Ellen Goldberg opened the meeting by posing this question to speakers
who would discuss everything from economic metaphors to "new mental landscapes"
to adaptive computation: "How do we apply all of this to business?" </P> <P> The
mere fact that SFI's leader asks such questions may be one reason the Business
Network's membership grew 60 percent in the past year to fifty-three companies.
Of course, another explanation for the rise is SFI's growing stature among
academicians as the nation's leader in complexity research. A representative of
The Boeing Company, a new Business Network member, wrote on a comment card after
the October meeting; "This is some of the best work being done on complex
adaptive systems." </P>
<P> So what practical lessons can biology offer a company
like Boeing, Coopers & Lybrand, or Solectron Corporation? Plenty, it seems. One
of the liveliest discussions at the one-day meeting involved the development and
use of genetic algorithms, or GAs, as they are more often called. Genetic
algorithms introduce a series of "mutations" in software designed to solve a
particular problem and then test each mutant's computational performance with a
so-called fitness function. Scheduling is one of many applications of GAs. </P>

<BR><BR>
<P> One longtime Business Network supporter
sitting quietly in the audience-Deere & Company analyst Bill Fulkerson-knows
first hand how algorithms can boost factory productivity. After the 1970s and
1980s shakeout in the farm-equipment industry, Deere laid off thousands of
workers and razed older plants in the face of a steep downturn in demand caused
by declining farm income. The company remodeled its remaining plants and switched
to incentives that rewarded the performance of teams of workers. </P> 

<P> After Fulkerson learned about SFI's research on complexity theory and genetic
algorithms, he convinced Deere executives to fund development of a prototype
system incorporating GAs to schedule the remodeled Moline, Illinois, seed-planter
manufacturing plant. The plant relies on a challenging
just-in-time-at-point-of-use delivery of parts. The system puts a premium on
optimal assembly of parts to assemble eight-, ten-, twelve-, sixteen-, twenty-,
twenty-four-, and thirty-one-row planters. Shipping dealer orders directly off
the assembly line without large inventories of planters of various sizes can be a
day-to-day scheduling conundrum. </P> <P> At the same time, plant managers are
not SFI regulars and no Deere plant manager could be expected to assume the risk
of incorporating a GA into his or her facility. To overcome that hurdle,
Fulkerson convinced engineering managers at the John Deere Technical Center to
assume the risk. They funded the development of the GA for the Moline plant and
agreed to assume the liability if it didn't work.</P><P>Fortunately, a Deere
production scheduler at the Moline factory had come up with a few rules of thumb
that-when broken-resulted in production delays. For instance, one rule of thumb
was: don't build too many identical pieces of equipment in a row. When that
happened, key parts were exhausted and that resulted in delays. "These rules of
thumb," Fulkerson said, "were incorporated into the fitness function of the GA."
</P> <P> With the introduction of the new scheduling system, the atmosphere of
the factory improved along with productivity. Shop floor schedulers and
supervisors were free to focus on strategic issues. Now, the GA has the final
word; it produces daily and weekly schedules. Employees even began checking the
GA-generated production schedules to plan their weekly activities-even vacation
time. "The GA software became the focal point for improving the processing and
performance on the assembly-line floor," Fulkerson said. "Now, production is up
50 percent at that plant, and the scheduling tool is one reason why." Other Deere
plants are implementing GAs. </P> Lawrence "David" Davis, founder of Tica
Associates of Newbury, Massachusetts, and a meeting speaker, noted Deere's
experience as well as that of U S West, which currently is studying the use of
GAs to more efficiently route telephone calls through its fiber optic network.
Davis also noted that a Pasadena-based investment company manages a $12 billion
securities fund with the help of a GA. The software helps its managers decide
which securities to buy and which securities to sell. Understandably, Davis said
companies and other investment funds that use GAs would rather not talk about
their particular applications in great detail. But Davis thinks the potential for
GAs is beginning to be realized by other U.S. companies. "There are a lot of GAs
out there, and a lot of them are successful-they are exploding right now," he
said. "There is a war heating up in the scheduling domain." Charles Darwin
probably would be pleased.<BR><BR></TD>

<FONT SIZE="1" face="helvetica, ariel"><B>How Plants and Animals Evolved</B></font>
<BR>SFI researchers are investigating how GAs
might be used to create or modify other computer programs. Their work and that of
other researchers also could provide insights into how species of plants and
animals evolved. "What I like are these feelings of analogy between GAs and
genetics," Davis said, "like how the DNA encodes how to construct more DNA." On
the other hand, he said many academics are reluctant to use techniques like GAs
for which  no theory has yet been developed. </P> <P> Melanie Mitchell, director
of SFI's Adaptive Computation Program, described her research on algorithms. One
approach uses a population of virtual chromosomes with "bit strings" of ones and
zeros instead of the alphabet of the four nucleotide bases of DNA. "Mutations"
are introduced into the virtual chromosomes and the chromosomes are allowed to
"crossover," or reciprocally exchange pieces of bit strings among each other. The
technique is being used in an attempt to crack one of structural biology's
toughest nuts--how to design a protein that, after it crimps, folds, and twists,
assumes a desired three-dimensional structure. For a given sequence of amino
acids that make up such a hypothetical protein, "fitness" can be defined as a
molecule that folds up neatly and, thus, contains low potential energy. "We can't
solve it yet," Mitchell said.</P> <P> However, she said the algorithms have
already been used to optimize scheduling, designs of circuits, and drug design,
as well as phone-call routing. She said she and her SFI colleagues are trying to
understand how to predict which algorithms would work in given situations. "They
are not the best algorithms for global optimization, unless they are used in a
hybrid way with other search methods," she said. "However, they seem to be good
at finding reasonably good solutions fairly quickly." </P>

Roger Ray, program manager of Intel Corporation's External Research Relations, took notes during
Mitchell's presentation. Later, during a break, Ray said such novel spin-offs of
complexity research are vital to Intel, because they should inevitably create
more demand for speedy Intel chips. GAs and other "compelling new software
applications" will require the next generation of Intel chips. That, of course,
will be good for Intel as well as the users of such algorithms, said Ray. "We
need to help the industry discover new applications," he said. "And we continue
to look at complex systems, which might create or enable some interesting new
applications that involve high performance."

<FONT SIZE="1" face="helvetica, ariel"><B>The Car and How We Live</B></font><BR>
Intel's strategic corporate approach is itself being viewed as a promising paradigm 
for building "the new economy." The Intel approach
is based on cooperation and interdependence with "complementors," hardware and
software companies that might benefit from Intel chips. Intel's interdependent
mind-set surfaces on TV advertisements for computer makers that conclude with the
microprocessor equivalent of the Nike swoosh, the "Intel Inside" logo and the
now-familiar five-tone chime. Harvard Business School Professor Adam
Brandenburger, the luncheon speaker at the October meeting and an expert on the
science of game theory, said Intel is not alone. "We're constructing new mental
landscapes," he said. "We're moving toward greater interdependence." 
<P>
That interdependence is blossoming on company desktops and the Internet. It is, as
Brandenburger said in his luncheon talk, part of "the new infrastructural change"
in modern society. The last technologically induced societal shift came with the
development of the mass-produced automobile. Of course, the car changed where we
live, how we live, and what our society has become. In Brandenburger's new
infrastructure, the whole is everything while the parts are nothing: Computer
hardware and software, networks and browsers have no value in isolation. The
interdependence can be seen each day as millions of computer users boot up and
phone lines begin to hum with data. Brandenburger thinks the virtual real estate
sitting vacant along the Internet is primed for development. He predicts that
things like consumer buying coalitions, custom newspapers, customized compact
discs, and search engines that have an individual's interests in mind could soon
be a mouse click away. "The only reason we haven't seen consumers doing this," he
said, "is they couldn't find each other." 
</P>
<P>As after-lunch coffee was being imbibed
along with Brandenburger's ideas, Rosanne Cahn, chief economist of the equity
division of the New York-based Credit Suisse First Boston raised a question. Did
his definition of economics include the creation and distribution of scarce
resources? Brandenburger responded that his new economics would be one in which
entities will be judged in the marketplace by the "value" rather than the
"resources" they create. "There are all kinds of things out there that we would
want if we could use our existing resources more efficiently," agreed Cahn.
Later, she said she needed to sit down and have a long discussion with
Brandenburger about the economic implications of value versus resources. 
</P>
<P>
Such lively interactions were exactly what SFI President Goldberg had hoped for when
she opened the meeting. You could call it creating value out of the thin Santa Fe
air.
