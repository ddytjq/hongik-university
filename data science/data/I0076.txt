<H1>The Ryman Football (Isthmian) League</H1>
<H2>Founded: 1905</H2>
<P>Until the early years of this century the only competitive fixtures for
amateur clubs in the South of England were various cup competition. The
remainder of the season was filled with friendly matches. Several leading London
clubs were invited to a meeting to consider forming a strong amateur league and
the result was the Isthmian League. Membership of the league was by invitation
only. Its motto was 'honor sufficit' and consequently no trophy was awarded to
the champions, nor were medals awarded to the players. This tradition continued
until 1973 when the FA abolished the term 'Amateur' as no longer being
appropriate. Since the early 70's the league has benefited from sponsorship and
consequently has been known by a variety of names. The previous sponsorship by
ICIS was terminated by the league in September 1997, alleging that various
payments due under the sponsorship had not been made, and for a while the league
was once again known as the Isthmian League. Since 1998 the League has been
sponsored by Rymans and is known as the Ryman Football League.</P>

<H2>Area Covered</H2>
<P>The League's members are based in and around the Greater London area.
Traditionally the boundary was set at 40 miles from the centre of London, 
recently Yeovil Town have expanded this boundary somewhat. The area covered
overlaps that of the <A HREF="docmarten.html">Dr. Marten's League</A>, clubs
relegated from the <A HREF="conf.html">Conference</A> are placed in the league
of their preference where possible, usually the one which they were previously
members of.</P>
<H2>Structure</H2>
<P>4 divisions, 87 clubs<BR><A HREF="#isthp">Premier Division</A> (22 clubs)<BR><A
HREF="#isth1">Division One</A> (22 clubs)<BR><A HREF="#isth2">Division Two</A>
(22 clubs)<BR><A HREF="#isth3">Division Three</A> (21 clubs)</P>
<P>Over the years the Isthmian League gradually increased its membership from
the initial number of 6 to 22 by 1972. Clubs which graced the Isthmian League in
this period include Wimbledon, Wycombe Wanderers and the now defunct Maidstone
United. The league was expanded to two divisions in 1973 and a third division
followed in 1977 at which time the divisions were re-designated as Premier,
First and Second. From 1982-83 it was agreed that the league champions would be
promoted to the <A HREF="conf.html">Alliance Premier League</A> and that the
bottom two clubs in Division Two would be relegated to the Athenian League and
replaced by the top two of that league, subject to facilities. The arrangement
with the Athenian League only lasted a couple of years. Previous expansion of
the Isthmian League had drawn new clubs mainly from the Athenian League and  in
1985 the Isthmian League effectively absorbed the Athenian by electing most of
their clubs to an expanded Division Two which was split into two sections. The
Athenian League was forced to close down as it was unable to find enough
replacement clubs of a suitable standard. More recently the regionalised
Division Two has been abandoned in favour of Division Two and Division Three.</P>
