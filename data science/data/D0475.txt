<h3>
<b>Will you answer questions ?</b>
</h3>

As a rule, we read all questions and if these indicate omissions, errors or lack of clarity, we adapt the lessons. We answer personally only, if time permits.
If a question is of general interest and is an important alteration of or addition to the lessons, it will end up in this faq.
<h3>
<b>Why isn't your site sexy ?</b></h3>
We want it to be clear and fast.
<h3>
<b>Other tutorials are for free, why isn't yours ?</b></h3>
<ul><li>
Ours is better ;-) &nbsp;: less encyclopedical, less theoretical, less to read, you just want to code Java, right ?
<li>
You get, you give, you don't want to disturb the balance of the Force.
<li>
Compare our rates to what you'd pay for a book that covers everything that we do.
