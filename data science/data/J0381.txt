      <P>&nbsp;</P>

      <P>I have owned a Miata since 1996 and between the wife and I
      we now own 3 of them. I got started driving the Miata in autocrossing
      and very quickly modified my car to CSP status. A fellow club
      member and his wife then introduced me to track events. It didn&#146;t
      take long for me to decide that autocrossing was fun but what
      I enjoyed most was high-speed track events. I started going to
      as many Driver Education seminars as I could afford and fit into
      my schedule.</P>

      <P>My local track is Roebling Road Raceway in Bloomingdale, GA.
      This is a great track to learn car control and is a fun track
      to drive in a Miata. I have been lucky to attend events here
      with Florida Crown Region of PCA and also with the Z Club from
      North Carolina. I also have track time at both circuits of Summit
      Point in W.Va., Pocono&#146;s North circuit and at Texas Motor
      Speedway.</P>

      <P>At a recent event at Roebling, where I&#146;ve gained most
      of my track time experience, I was surprised to see my name on
      the roster as an instructor. I had never instructed before and
      had not expected to be asked to do so at this event. I went to
      the Head Instructor to find out if he had made a mistake. He
      told me that it was &quot;time I paid my dues&quot; since I had
      been driving with them so often. I explained that I didn&#146;t
      know if I was ready to instruct. The Head Instructor told me
      that I was needed and would do fine.</P>

      <P>With a little trepidation I accepted the role of instructor
      and tried to find my student. I met him for the first time on
      Saturday morning about 10 minutes before he had to attend his
      mandatory classroom time. I wished I had been able to get him
      in my car for some laps before he was scheduled to drive. By
      taking him onto the track as a passenger I would have been able
      to show him the line and the braking points before he drove.
      The run groups made it impossible since he was attending classroom
      instruction while I was on the track.<BR>
<BR>
      My student was running in the group for first time drivers, which
      is the Green group. He was an 18-year-old high school student
      who lived about 10 minutes from me in Charleston. He had zero
      track experience but worked after school for the local Porsche
      racecar shop. He was driving a 924 so at least we had similar
      style cars in common. Both cars are of the front engine/rear
      wheel drive configuration and would handle similarly on the track.</P>

      <P>After some explanations of the signals I would use to guide
      him around the track we got strapped in and waited on pit road
      for our turn to drive. To say I was nervous was an understatement.
      To say this kid was full of testosterone was an understatement
      too!! Oh, by the way did I mention he worked at Porsche racecar
      shop!!! Important point here. The owner&#146;s sons are only
      about 3 or 4 years older than my student but have been doing
      this for years. They spent Friday at a lapping day and had taken
      him for rides in their very fast racecars. He was ready to go
      prove what he could do!!!</P>

      <P>I determined the first thing we needed to do was learn that
      he was not going to turn championship lap times. After a very
      touchy warm up lap I impressed upon him that his first job was
      to learn the line of the track. We spent the whole session working
      on the line but I quickly discovered that &quot;going fast&quot;
      was his primary goal. The second problem was his perception of
      what going fast involved. It seemed that the feeling of the car
      accelerating out of the turns was what he perceived as turning
      a fast lap. He did not seem to understand the need to be smooth.</P>

      <P>The next thing I did was to take him for a ride in my car
      during my run session. He seemed to understand what was needed
      to get a car around the racetrack and turn decent lap times.
      The problem was as soon as we made some progress in one area
      we lost ground somewhere else. He started learning to be smooth
      but then started missing all his turn in points.</P>

      <P>At our lunch break I sat with one of the experienced instructors
      and talked about my progress or lack there of in learning how
      to instruct. She gave me the most important tip I received all
      weekend. She told me to make my student leave his car in 4th
      gear and concentrate on driving. I realized that this was what
      he needed and was determined to try it.</P>

      <P>When we went out on the track the next time he was VERY unhappy
      about not shifting. He kept complaining about how his car had
      no power in 4th gear and how slow we were driving. I insisted
      and we finished the session with a big improvement on his ability
      to drive the line. The next session he wanted to know what we
      were going to learn and do this time. Once again I insisted on
      no shifting and he was even more unhappy than before. He spent
      the better part of the session complaining to me about how slow
      we were. I then pointed out to him how we had caught and passed
      at least 4 or 5 cars with more horsepower than his car had. When
      I asked him how that could happen he was puzzled. I then explained
      to him that the only explanation for this was that he was driving
      better than the other drivers. This made a big impression and
      his complaining stopped.</P>

      <P>In the next session as we were headed down the straight a
      much faster 944 caught us and we let him pass. The next thing
      I knew my student decided he was going to &quot;catch this guy
      and pass him&quot;. I told him to forget it and pay attention
      to driving. A few turns later, and what did we see?! The 944
      was finishing a 360-degree spin off the track. As we passed him
      I looked over to my student and asked him if he knew why that
      had happened. He said no. I then beat on my chest with my fists
      and told him it was because that guy was bragging about how he
      had passed you and forgot what he needed to do to get around
      the track safely. Made another impression.</P>

      <P>Little did I know that all weekend my student had had some
      of his friends timing his laps. I heard them telling him how
      he was running more than 5 seconds a lap faster than he had at
      the start. I figured we had a pretty good weekend. His Dad was
      really happy that he hadn&#146;t crashed and thanked me for my
      patience and time. He had shaved 5 seconds a lap off his times
      so he felt like he was FAST. He started to learn to be consistent
      on his turn in points. He learned that he did not need to feel
      like he was going fast to be going fast. And last but not least
      we had not had any off track excursions and I left the track
      in one piece.</P>

      <P>Was it fun?? You bet. Do I want to do it again? Yup!! I just
      hope that the PCA people think I did as good a job as my student&#146;s
      Dad thinks I did.<BR>
