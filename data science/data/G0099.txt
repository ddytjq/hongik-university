    <P><B>July 14, 1999: </B>Since 1977, Dr. Martin Weisskopf of
    NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center has served as the project
    scientist for the Chandra X-ray Observatory, which is scheduled
    for launch on July 20. <FONT COLOR="#000000">Chandra will be
    the most powerful and most sensitive X-ray telescope ever launched,
    and it will do for the field of X-ray astronomy what the Hubble
    Space Telescope has done for the field of astronomy in the visible
    and near-visible portions of the spectrum.</FONT></P>

    <P>Earlier in his career, Weisskopf was a co-investigator on
    the second High-Energy Astronomy Observatory (HEAO-2, also called
    the Einstein Observatory) launched in 1978, a forerunner of Chandra.</P>

    <P>Recently, Science@NASA sat down with Weisskopf to interview
    him about the pending launch and the new science that Chandra
    will make possible.</P>

    <P><B><I>Science@NASA: </I></B><I>How long have you been working
    working on Chandra and how does it feel being so close to getting
    it off the ground?</I></P>

    <P><B>MW: </B>I started in 1977 [when it was still called the
    Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility, or AXAF], so you can do
    the arithmetic. It has been a long time. My feelings are hard
    to describe. I know that I am getting very excited despite the
    fact that I am a veteran of the space program and I know we have
    still a few hurdles to go through successfully before we start
    getting data. These are incredibly complex systems that we are
    launching and we've done everything possible to make sure that
    they will operate perfectly, but I will be much happier when
    I see the X-ray data coming through the system. So I am extremely
    excited and and at the same time extremely nervous.</P>

    <P><B><I>Science@NASA: </I></B><I>More so than on HEAO-2?</I></P>

    <P><B>MW</B>: Oh, yes. On HEAO-2, I was one of many co-investigators.
    I played a role in the formation and concept of HEAO-2, and helped
    write the original proposal. But I had not spent every day of
    my life breathing it until the time of its launch. For the Chandra
    X-ray Observatory, I am &quot;the&quot; Project Scientist, although
    I am very ably helped by a staff of scientists both here at Marshall
    Space Flight Center, colleagues at the University of Alabama
    in Huntsville -- a handful who have been with the program even
    longer than I have -- and a large number of outstanding scientists
    at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.</P>

    <P>Chandra is the product of so many talented people. Thousands
    of people have worked on various aspects of this observatory
    throughout these many years and all of them have played an important
    role, from the person who does the inventory of the spare parts
    to the scientist who dreamed up a clever way of making a charge-coupled
    detector work reliably in a radiation environment. All have contributed
    and it is impossible to list all their names and you always get
    nervous that you left somebody out. I would like to note the
    major contributions of Harvey Tannenbaum [director of the Chandra
    Science Center], Leon van Speybroeck [the Telescope Scientist],
    and Riccardo Giacconi who is the father of X-ray astronomy and
    whose vision and insight this mission represents.</P>

    <P>But I am the one who has the responsibility for the scientific
    integrity of this great observatory and at times you really feel
    the awesomeness of that burden and privilege. It is a burden
    and a privilege all at the same time.</TD>

    </TABLE><B><I>Science@NASA: </I></B><I>Briefly, what is a project
    scientist? Is it a sort of point man in the science community?</I></P>

    <P><B>MW</B>: I think that is fairly accurate. Let me try to
    define point man. I am the person responsible for the scientific
    integrity of the program. Accomplishing this requires making
    sure this entire observatory is responsive to the scientific
    program and objectives set out. That can be everything from chairing
    the science working group that debates issues of science policy
    and discusses requirements. It's making sure that the requirements
    are understood by the engineers and managers. It is making sure
    that when requirements could be changed by a little bit and save
    the taxpayer a lot of money that it is brought to everyone's
    attention. It is doing detailed calculations, it is staying up
    late at night during the calibration of the observatory. It is
    going to Washington to help NASA Headquarters explain to congressmen
    why is it that this observatory is important -- after all they
    have already bought one observatory -- and why does this country
    need another one? All of these things are tied up in the role
    and responsibility of what it is to be a project scientist.</P>

    <P><B><I>Science@NASA: </I></B><I>That brings up the next question.
    Why </I>do<I> we need another observatory? What will CXO give
    us that the Hubble Space Telescope and Compton Gamma Ray Observatory
    do not? How will it go beyond HEAO-2 and some of the other X-ray
    observatories?</I></P>

    <P><B>MW</B>: Clearly that is an important question. The Chandra
    X-ray Observatory is one of NASA's Great Observatories for Astrophysics.
    It's the one that will observe X-ray emissions (light at extremely
    high energies) of the universe. Chandra is designed to complement
    the Hubble (which looks at the visible light emissions from the
    universe), the Compton (which looks at even higher energies than
    Chandra is capable of), the planned Space Infrared Telescope
    Facility (SIRTF), and the ground-based radio observatories.</P>

    also managed this program and its three spacecraft. Credit: NASA/Marshall</FONT></P>

    <P>We discovered years ago with the launch and operation of the
    Einstein X-ray Observatory (HEAO-2), the forerunner of Chandra,
    that X-ray emission was not just an oddity but is, if I can use
    a fancy word, ubiquitous: it's everywhere. Every known major
    class of astronomical objects emits X-rays. In many cases this
    was an outstanding discovery, and a very surprising discovery.
    We X-ray astronomers brought astrophysics the first unique evidence
    that black holes exist based on X-ray observations of Cygnus
    X-1. With radio observations and subsequent optical observations,
    we helped nail down the location, identify the companion -- a
    normal star -- and nail down the period, so we could use Kepler's
    laws and determine that the compact object emitting the X-rays
    was a black hole.</TD>

    <!--/NOEDIT-->It is an important piece of scientific capability
    that Chandra is providing, so important that the National Academy
    of Sciences said twenty years ago that we abs<FONT COLOR="#000000">olutely
    need to have it in order to further our understanding of the
    universe. There are some things it can do that no other observatory
    at other wavelengths can do, and there are some things it cannot
    do where we need the other wavelengths. I a</FONT>m not saying,
    &quot;We're the best discipline and everybody else should go
    away.&quot; We need a multiwavelength view to understand what
    makes the universe tick. NASA and the National Science Foundation
    (for the ground-based work) are providing the scientific community
    with the tools to do that.</P>

    <P><B><I>Science@NASA: </I></B><I>X-ray astronomy has been a
    series of surprises. In 1949, a simple spectrometer carried by
    a U.S.-launched V-2 rocket detected X-rays coming from the Sun.
    Even so, for years afterwards the conventional wisdom was, &quot;Well,
    maybe stars and galaxies are emitting, but they're so weak that
    you will just see a black sky.&quot;</I></P>

    <P><B>MW: </B>A wonderful compliment to X-ray astronomy is that
    every mission has brought such incredible surprises, starting
    from the first one, where no one thought we would see anything.
    The Sun was known to be an X-ray source, although no one understood
    exactly how this 6,000-degree sun could produce a million-degree
    outer skin. It takes a temperatures on the order of millions
    of degrees to produce X-rays, you move the sun back to the distance
    of the nearest stars you would never see it with the equipment
    of the time in 1962.</P>

    vspace="10"></I>It turned out that was not true. We could see
    lots of bright X-ray sources. They turned out to be black holes
    and neutron stars orbiting more normal stars throughout our galaxy.
    The next missions found the incredible time variability of these
    objects, then missions like Einstein found X-rays coming from
    quasars to normal stars to hot gas pervading the space between
    the clusters of galaxies, and many extra-galactic sources. It's
    a wavelength-chauvinistic fact, but most of the mass that we
    see in the universe is tied up in hot X-ray emitting gas, even
    more than we see from the stars in the galaxies.</P>

    <P>Every X-ray mission has provided a dramatic surprise. The
    most recent one was the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). RXTE
    increased the size of its detectors (not the ability to resolve
    objects) to be able to look at time variability more carefully.
    It has brought beautiful surprises. Researchers here at Marshall
    Space Flight Center, in fact, have made some discoveries with
    Rossi about magnetars,<B> </B>which are X-ray sources with huge
    magnetic fields on the order of 10<!--NOEDIT--><sup><!--/NOEDIT--><FONT

    On the surface of the Earth, the field is half a Gauss, so this
    is a huge difference. Just as any technology advances in sciences
    have brought enormous surprises, I am confident that Chandra
    will also, because it is more powerful.</P>

    <P>I hate to use superlatives because we have superlatives in
    our culture today that are so overvalued for our athletes, our
    cars, etc. -- but this observatory is a technological marvel.
    It has the capability to distinguish objects -- we call that
    the &quot;angular resolution&quot; -- to almost a factor of ten
    better than anything that has been done before. It has the sensitivity
    to look for distant and faint objects at a factor of 20 to 50
    times better than anything that has been done before. It brings
    to the fore, at a practical level, spectroscopy -- the ability
    to dissect the energy spectrum and look very carefully at the
    different energies emitted by the X-ray sources. We can study
    the line features and their characteristics -- what we call plasma
    diagnostics. We'll be studying plasmas under conditions you can't
    reproduce on Earth.</P>

    see that gravity is holding these gases in the clusters, and
    that gravity has to do with some type of matter. Right now we

    we don't know what it is. It could be anything from rocks to
    superconducting cosmic strings that some theorists talk about,
    an exotic relic from the Big Bang. Perhaps we X-ray astronomers

    like this: both in the clusters of galaxies and even in certain

    <P><B><I>Science@NASA: </I></B><I>You mentioned black holes earlier.
    They became very popular when they were proposed and possibly
    observed in the '70s. The public kind of took for granted that
    they existed but the scientific community stood back and said
    that they probably were there but we just don't have the observational
    evidence yet.</I></P>

    <P><B>MW</B>: In the last decade we astrophysicists, both observers
    and theorists, have come to the conclusion that there is no question
    as to the existence of black holes. There are two categories
    that are quite unambiguous. The first is the category of black
    holes with 10 to 12 times the mass of our Sun. We typically find
    these in binary systems where there is a normal star and such
    a stellar-mass black hole -- a small black hole -- orbiting each
    other in a binary system.</P>

    It takes two to make a black hole noticeable: the black hole
    itself, and a visible companion feeding gigatons of material
    towards the hole. Like too many commuters crowding into a subway
    entrance, things get hot as the gas falls toward the black hole
    and emits X-rays.</FONT></P>

    <P>Then there is a second category of black holes which weigh
    from a million to a billion times as much as the Sun. We typically
    find these in the centers of galaxies, especially active galaxies,
    that can have a lot of X-ray, radio, and optical emissions. It
    seems to be a property of the universe that a galaxy can have
    a massive black hole at its center. That also, astrophysically
    speaking, is incontrovertible.</P>

    <P>We once thought of the universe as kind of quiet and peaceful
    and soothing. It was assumed to have no beginning or end. We
    now know that is not correct. There was a revolution in our understanding
    -- with the discovery of red shifts, the expansion of the universe,
    the cosmic microwave background and so on. But I think black
    holes are here to stay. This is no longer just science fiction.
    We believe in them: the mathematics is there, and the physical
    evidence is there. If it looks like a rose and smells like a
    rose, then it must be a rose.</TD>

    is certainly an interesting question, and one where I think it
    is reasonably fair to say there is not universal agreement, but
    lots of theories floating around.Gravity is holding these clusters
    together, and if you add up what is in the stars and galaxies,
    and what is in the hot X-ray emitting gas, you find there is
    not enough matter to hold that stuff together.</P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Right</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1"
     FACE="Arial">: What looks like abstract art from the 1960s is
    a pinpoint of beauty for the Chandra team. The message in this
    piece of art is that the telescope will focus most of the incoming
    X-rays into a very narrow circle, so distant stars will appear
    as points and not blurs.</FONT></P>

    <P>So something else is there. And that &quot;something else&quot;
    could be anything from rocks to brown dwarves [very cool, small
    stars], and perhaps more exotic objects. As I noted previously,
    Chandra can play a significant and unique role in helping us
    unravel this puzzle.</P>

    <P>Another area that I think will be very fruitful and very interesting
    to us -- and perhaps surprising to the theorists -- follows the
    recent discovery of the afterglow of gamma-ray bursts. Gamma-ray
    bursts are another two-hour topic of discussion. These mysterious
    bursts of energy in X-rays and gamma rays -- first discovered
    in the gamma rays -- have been shown to be at cosmological distances.
    These are not local phenomena, hence the amount of energy output
    is humongous! These systems will be studied in all wavelength
    bands. I anticipate that observations with Chandra will be very
    exciting!</TD>

    </TABLE>The origin of the gamma-ray bursts is a very interesting
    question and observatories such as Chandra have such great sensitivity
    they will be able to look at the afterglows long after the bursts
    have taken place. We will have the sensitivity to study those
    objects and help determine what they are. Right now people are
    talking about neutron star-neutron star collisions, neutron star-back
    hole collisions and who-knows-what. Whenever there's a phenomenon,
    there are new theories, and I think we will make some very interesting
    progress over the next few years with Chandra and the other observatories
    -- Hubble, Compton, SIRTF, and radio telescopes -- to see what
    is really producing the gamma-ray bursts.</P>

    Artist's concept depicts X-rays arriving at the high-energy imaging
    camera to produce a picture of an X-ray object.</FONT></P>

    <P>A third topic, interestingly enough, is the study of baby
    quasars. By taking an extremely long exposure -- a deep survey
    to see much more faintly than anything done before -- you will
    detect very distant, very faint X-ray emitting objects. Then
    we will use optical and radio telescopes to see what those objects
    look like in those wavelengths. Lots of them will turn out to
    be stars, lots of them will turn out to be quasars, and lots
    of them will turn out to be galaxies or clusters of galaxies.
    But one thing we know already is that some have to be very different
    than they are today. From previous missions we know if you take
    a less sensitive telescope and look, there is a glow, and that
    glow is made up of unresolved objects.</P>

    <P>If you had a telescope, with the sensitivity and resolution
    of Chandra, you would see three or five or ten objects. What
    is terrifically exciting is that we already know that some of
    these objects must either be very different in their physical
    properties than their older counterparts, or that there are other
    types of objects waiting to be discovered. This is because we
    cannot simply account for this glow, the diffuse X-ray background,
    without appealing to some differences. The deep exposures will
    be very interesting. Either we will we discover new classes of
    objects or discover something interesting about the old classes
    of objects. Baby quasars didn't do what you thought they did
    -- or perhaps there is something very different in the early
    universe waiting for us to discover.</TD>

    four Great Observatories for orbiting astrophysics. Comparisons
    to Hubble are going to be inevitable. What should the public
    expect to be different about the images from Chandra, and what
    should they expect to be magnificent about the images that Chandra
    produces?</I></P>

    <P><B>MW</B>: Some of the most interesting astronomical pictures
    are those not of what we call point objects but of extended objects,
    because there's this very interesting pattern. Many types of
    X-ray sources are extended: the debris of exploding stars as
    shock waves heat the interstellar medium, dense regions of bright
    X-ray stars, the hot gas in galaxies, and clusters of galaxies,
    the largest known structures in the universe. In my opinion,
    the pictures will be as spectacular as any of the pictures from
    Hubble.</P>

    other. We are certainly not in competition with any other wavelength

    observations to understand how the universe ticks.</TD>

    <P><B>MW</B>: Several weeks after the launch, assuming that everything
    goes nominally and smoothly. Quite frankly, I will be very surprised
    if it does. Not that I think anything will go terribly wrong,
    but I've been through launches before, and it always takes us
    a little bit longer to get everything going than we thought.
    Certain events cannot take place immediately. We want to make
    sure that the vacuum of space pumps out all the water vapor and
    gases that have collected inside the various pieces of equipment.
    We have to do certain calibrations which have to wait until the
    contamination covers open. So sometime in the third or fourth
    week we will start to actually take some data. You can imagine
    - for me, the nervousness and excitement just begin with the
    launch. They don't end with a successful launch, it just starts,
    until we have checked out all the instruments and see the first
    X-rays.</TD>
