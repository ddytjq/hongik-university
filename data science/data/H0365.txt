</H3>
<H5>            Dear Readers of Virtual Physics,
</h5>
<p><DD>     
          Since the recent edition of Virtual Physics has been published,
          several important organizational events took place.
<p>
          We are pleased to inform you that a new mirror site of Virtual
          Physics, http://www.tp.umu.se/vp.html, has been made available
          for browsing. The site is located at Department of Theoretical
          Physics at Umeå University in Sweden, at the TIPTOP server,
          which is the largest and the best known place with the
          collection of materials related to physics. We do believe that
          the new site will significantly improve the access to our
          journal by the European users of WWW.
<p>          
          The new mirror site is administered by Dr. Kenneth Holmlund. We
          were pleased when Dr. Holmlund accepted our invitation to join
          the Editorial Board of Virtual Physics. Dr. Holmlund's work in
          theoretical physics is already well known, especially the study
          of certain electrodynamic properties of superconductors. This
          is a subject which has a long and appreciated tradition of
          research in Sweden. Right now, Dr. Kenneth Holmlund is strongly
          involved in a research activity which is related to the
          implementation of the Internet technology in education and the
          exchange of information between physicists.
<p>          
          It is great pleasure and honor to introduce to you yet another
          member of the Editorial Board. Dr. Krzysztof Wroblewski is a
          Research Assistant Professor of Biochemistry and Biophysics and
          the director of the NMR Facility at the University of
          Pensylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia. His research
          interests include implementation of multi-dimensional NMR
          spectroscopy to medical sciences, nuclear relaxation,
          techniques of image processing, and artificial intelligence. We
          believe that Virtual Physics will benefit from collaboration
          with Dr. Wroblewski also due to his excellent experience with
          the Internet.

<h3>            Abstract
</h3>  
            A multifractal Wavelet Packet approach is described for characterising
            one dimensional signals using the Hurst exponent. The Hurst exponent
            quantifies scaling behaviour between data points, and classifies these
            trends as persistent, antipersistent, or random walk. A multifractal
            approach provides additional information regarding local scaling
            behaviour. This algorithm uses commercially available software to
            perform the Wavelet Packet Transform, with additional manipulation
            carried out using an iterative spreadsheet function to determine the
            regression slope in lagged windows. The method is demonstrated in a
            biophysical reaction- diffusion system where image-analysis was used
            to collect raw data concerning the spatial distribution of local
            chemical (enzyme) concentrations. These one dimensional signals
            (Enzyme Walks) display antipersistent scaling at small lags, but
            random walk and persistent scaling at longer lags. This emphasises the
            importance of local coordination during enzyme secretion, which breaks
            down at longer lags as a function of the advancing diffusion front.

                                      
<h3>          Introduction
</h3> 
          A straightforward approach to quantify, interpret or visualise
          correlations within one dimensional (1-D) sequences can be
          achieved with some partition function. We consider here the
          partition function called Wavelet Packet Analysis (WPA) which
          can identify local and global ordering in 1-D signals with
          respect to position, frequency and scale. Previous efforts have
          applied this technique to estimate the global Hurst exponent in
          1-D signals [1}. The Hurst exponent was developed to estimate
          the fluctuations which occurred in the reservoir water level in
          the Nile River Dam [2]. The Hurst exponent is a time-series
          method named after the hydrologist who measured the daily water
          discharge levels over a 40 year period. He found a positive
          correlation between the 'peaks' and 'troughs' which fluctuate
          about an average value across the time-series of water level
          measurements. This statistic was used to quantify the
          persistence or antipersistence of feature details (in this
          original case, the day-to-day or month- to-month water levels).
          We note that in 1-D the Hurst exponent, H falls in the range
          of: 0 &lt;  H &lt;  1. A persistent trend is characterised by
          repetitive behaviour. For example, if a high value occurs at
          time, tx then at time t<sub>x+1</sub> one would expect the probability of
          another high value to be greater than 0.5. Persistent trends
          fall in the range 0.5 &lt;  H &lt; =1.0. Note that a random walk
          process which exhibits no correlation between values has a
          Hurst exponent H=0.5. This contrasts with an antipersistent
          trend where successive values are likely to alternate. For
          example, if a high value occurs at time, tx then at time t<sub>x+1</sub>
          one would be more likely to see a low value. Similarly,
          antipersistent scaling has a Hurst exponent, 0 &lt; = H &lt;  0.5.
<p>          
          This paper uses WPA to estimate the Hurst exponent. In
          addition, we demonstrate the method by examining a complex
          biophysical system which displays fractal-like scaling trends
          during enzyme secretion1. This gives rise to one dimensional
          signals called 'Enzyme Walks', which can be characterised using
          time series tools. Enzyme Walks are an example of a diffusion
          controlled spatial deposition process. From a practical
          viewpoint, we also extend the global method to estimate
          multifractal, or local scaling trends. This therefore extends
          the utility of this method to heterogeneous systems which
          display complex behaviours at multiple length or time scales.
          It is hoped that this method will find widespread application
          for the rapid analysis of complex, multifractal type signals
          encountered in physics, chemistry, biology or in other signal
          analysis situations.

          
<h3>        Global versus Local Scaling
</h3>          
          A global method provides a mean overview of statistical scaling
          behaviour. This may be useful as a first attempt at sequence
          characterisation, but is essentially best suited for
          homogeneous signals which do not display abrupt or complex
          feature fluctuations. A global analysis method only considers
          'macro-level' organisation [3]. This approach is therefore
          limited to simple systems, although the computational effort is
          usually small. This contrasts with a multifractal approach
          which looks for local feature fluctuations and therefore
          provides a 'micro-level' interpretation of scaling behaviour.
          However it is computationally more intensive than the global
          approach. This analytical method is best suited for
          heterogeneous signals which display complex feature
          fluctuations.

          
<h3>        Self-affine Scaling
</h3>  
          The application of the Hurst approach to characterise digital
          elevation profiles is straightforward in theory and in
          practice. Two dimensional images contain pixel information,
          which is defined by a grey-level range in the z-axis: 0 &lt; = z &lt; =
          255, as well as positional localization using cartesian
          coordinates. Using image-analysis, a one dimensional line (or
          lines) can be overlaid onto the image, and the grey-scale
          values which fall under the line generates an elevation profile
          series which constitute the 'Enzyme Walk'. These are examples
          of self-affine 1-D signals, where the x and y positions are
          well defined, but the z-axis is a fluctuating quantity.
          Magnified portions of such signals do not scale equally in all
          directions, resulting in scalar anisotropy. This violates the
          property of true self-similarity where finer feature details,
          under a magnification scale transform, should occur
          isotropically in all directions. The magnification factor used
          to rescale self-affine functions therefore depends on the
          direction.

          
<h3>        Biological Background
</h3>          
          We consider a biochemical synthesis system in a filamentous
          fungus. Fungal colonies can be grown on solid nutrient media in
          Petri-dishes. They can be germinated from a single spore, and
          differentiate into an interconnected mycelium composed of fine
          filaments called hyphae (see for example reference 3). These
          microorganisms derive their nutrition by secreting a range of
          exo-enzymes which enable them to breakdown substrate
          constituents for synthesis of new cell material. From a
          practical viewpoint, many of these exo-enzymes are useful
          industrially since the catalytic reactions carried out by
          enzymes such as laccase, Mn-peroxidase or lignin peroxidase are
          relatively non-specific and therefore valuable for breakdown of
          industrial dyes [4], bioremediation of pesticide residues [5]
          or lignocellulose bio-processing [6] for paper manufacture.
          From a theoretical viewpoint, the way in which these enzymes
          diffuse out and away from the hyphae gives rise to interesting
          chemical feedback reactions which generate spatial patterns via
          chemical diffusion, oscillations, travelling waves or
          multistability. Experimental details have been given previously
          [1], but we are considering the active secretion and diffusion
          of laccase enzyme during growth on a nutrient rich medium.
          Figure 1 illustrates both the radially symmetric growth of the
          fungal colony, and the histochemical stain (Orange colour)
          which has been used to identify the enzyme. Normally the
          spatial secretion zone of this enzyme is invisible. Figure 2
          displays the image-captured colony with a single digital line
          profile (in White) placed across the colony. Note that the
          colony germinated at time zero from the centre-point of the
          image. Figure 3 shows a pseudocoloured view of the grey-scale
          distribution which indexed the local, symmetrical fluctuation
          in laccase enzyme concentration. The rest of this paper
          considers the statistical scaling behaviour of a series of line
          profiles (Enzyme Walks) which were placed across different
          regions of the colony. Details regarding the global Hurst
          exponent are detailed in reference 1, while this paper extends
          this work by analysing for multifractal scaling.

<h3>       Numerical Approach
</h3>          
          Each radially symmetric colony grows outwards from the
          centre-point. Therefore we have two ways of approaching the
          analysis of this spatially extended system. Firstly, we can
          consider enzyme fluctuation from edge-to-edge across the plate
          [ALL], as in Figure 2. Secondly, we can consider growth only in
          one half of the circle [HALF], i.e. from centre-point to the
          edge. This second approach provides some indication of the
          importance of symmetrical growth in filamentous fungi.
          Furthermore this may reveal that the 'natural' antipersistence
          provided by the 'two-halves' of the radially symmetric colony
          is also present at very small scales in only one half of the
          whole. Note that in these experiments scaling is considered in
          short signal lengths of, L=256. Figure 4a shows a typical
          single digital line profile extracted from across the middle of
          the whole colony [ALL]. Figure 4b shows the frequency
          partitioning for the wavelet transform with the d.4 wavelet.
          The best basis entropy algorithm was used to compute the best
          basis from the wavelet packet table and these coefficients
          blocks are shown in black.

          To examine sensitivity to resolution scale changes, one can double the
          magnification and take a line profile from the centre-point to
          the right hand edge [HALF]. Figure 4c and 4d shows the
          respective 1-D profile and frequency partition with the d.4
          wavelet packet.

          
<h3>        Computer Software and Methodology
</h3>  
          One dimensional wavelet packet analysis (WPA) was performed on
          ascii data obtained via image processing which was imported
          into PC compatible software [7]. Example data sets are shown in
          Figures 4a and 4c. The best basis function was computed for at
          least 15 line profiles for each magnification (ALL and HALF).
          This listing of wavelet packet best basis coefficients,
          <img src=_cmn> was then used to estimate multifractal scaling
          behaviour. Note that the best basis coefficient listing is
          output in raw or unsorted format. Normally to compute the
          global fractal dimension we sort this list of coefficient
          energies from Highest to Lowest. However, to estimate local
          scaling trends we require the unsorted list of coefficient
          energies - which is equivalent to the order in which they were
          generated. If you look closely at the spatial relationship
          between Figures 4 a and b or Figure 4c and d it is clear that
          the 'black' blocks have significant spatial significance. In
          moving from left to right across the signal space, blocks of
          nodes are highlighted in black, which completely tile the
          position-frequency plane. This indicates the relative
          importance of individual features at different scales necessary
          to describe the signal. To estimate local Hurst exponents,
          Hlocal we can process these naturally ordered best basis
          coefficients to quantify scaling behaviour in windowed regions.
          This gives rise to the identification of local scaling trends.
          The global monofractal Hurst exponent was estimated using all
          coefficients with a windowed lag equal to one. In contrast, the
          degree of correlation between best basis coefficients separated
          by different lags can be estimated as follows. For local
          exponents, Hlocal one takes the listing of naturally ordered
          best basis coefficients and retains all coefficients at
          different lagged positions, e.g. 2,3,4,...etc. A second vector
          listing of coefficient index positions at each lag is also
          constructed and retained. One then sorts the best basis
          coefficients for each lag versus the lagged coefficient index
          positions, N, in descending order of magnitude.
          
<h3>        Mathematical Notation
</h3>  
          Wavelet Packet best basis coefficients are referred to by the
          notation, <img src=_cmn>. The sub- and superscripts index location
          and scale respectively. A power-law has been found [1] to
          describe the scaling shown between the numbers of coefficients,
          N<sub>r</sub> having a particular energy magnitude,<img src=_cmn> and 
          index position, N in a sorted listing from highest to lowest on
          log-log axes, following:
          
<P align=center><img width="312" height="42" border=2 alt="[ Equation 1 ]" src="e01.gif"></P><P align=right><b>(1)</b></P>
          
          The slope, <img src=_d> can then be used to index the Hurst
          exponent. From here, a straightforward algebraic arrangement of
          terms can be used to extract the Hurst exponent following:
          
<P align=center><img width="270" height="39" border=2 alt="[ Equation 2 ]" src="e02.gif"></P><P align=right><b>(2)</b></P>
          
          Note that in 2-D, the following relationship holds between the
          Fractal Dimension, D and the Hurst exponent, H: D=2-H.
          

<h3>         Multifractal Data Manipulation
</h3>  
          A simple spreadsheet function was used to estimate multifractal
          Hurst exponents (H<sub>local</sub>) using Sigma-Plot (Jandel Scientific,
          ver. 1.02). The list of unsorted best basis coefficients should
          be placed into column 1 - [e.g. notation is col(1),
          col(2),...]. A second list of length L, i.e. 1,2,3,...L<sub>max</sub>
          should be placed into col(2). Here L<sub>max</sub>=256. These 2 columns
          are the reference columns, and all subsequent calculations are
          performed by manipulating these two columns and placing output
          lagged data into adjacent columns to the right. In this example
          we estimate multifractal scaling over 12 different lag
          positions, however additional lagged positions can be added by
          extending this protocol. Sigma-Plot allows the data in columns
          1 and 2 to be manipulated. Essentially we need to isolate
          different data points belonging to the unsorted best basis in
          column 1, and isolate the respective coefficient index position
          from column 2 for each lag. This will allow us to estimate the
          global Hurst exponent. Then to carry out a local Hurst exponent
          analysis at lag=2, we need to identify and copy those
          coefficients in col(1) which are at a lagged position of 2, and
          do the same in col(2). In Sigma-Plot this function is performed
          by taking the n<sup>th</sup> value in a particular sequence (Figure 5a).
          In practice, we first operate on col(1) and col(2) by taking
          the n<sup>th</sup> data points at lag=1 for both columns and placing this
          data set into col(4) and (3). Later we will plot (x vs y)
          col(3) vs col(4) to estimate the regression [see Figure 5b].
          Then we again operate on col(1) and (2) but take the n<sup>th</sup> data
          points at lag=2 and place this paired data set into col(6) and
          (5) [see the first 8 lines of Figure 5a]. This process is
          continued until all lagged data sets have been created. Once
          all 12 lagged data sets are in place, we then plot a series of
          x vs y least-squares linear regressions on log-log axes. Figure
          6 details an example of this plotting scheme with the linear
          regressions plotted for all 12 lag positions. One can then use
          the slope exponent of the regression to estimate the individual
          H<sub>local</sub> values for each lag position following equations 1 and
          2. The necessary data manipulations in a spreadsheet
          environment are detailed below:

<h3>         Results and Discussion
</h3>          
          Since we had a minimum of fifteen digital line profiles for
          each enzyme walk (i.e. ALL and HALF), a series of graphs were
          generated similar to the one shown in Figure 6.
          
<p><center><TABLE WIDTH=90% BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=4 CELLPADDING=4><TR><TD><img alt="[ Image: Figure 6 ]" width="385" height="373" border=3 src="fig6.gif"></a></TD><TD><font size=-1>

          By taking the average slope for all data sets for the two treatments,
          it was possible to obtain mean statistics for a multifractal
          description of local enzyme activity concentration. This provides an
          overview of the scaling behaviour between nearest neighbour regions
          separated by a defined lag position (measured in pixel units). This
          data is plotted for both ALL and HALF in Figure 7.

          Clearly the global Hurst exponent at a lag=1 returns an
          H<sub>global</sub>=0.378 for ALL, and for HALF, 
          the H<sub>global</sub>=0.345. However
          the multifractal description shows a more complicated picture
          for the scaling behaviour. For example in the ALL data set, an
          antipersistent trend occurs up to a lag of 6, with longer lags
          showing approximate random walk behaviour (H=0.5). For HALF,
          there is a rapid degeneration towards random walk behaviour,
          although there is a pronounced sinusoidal oscillation from
          antipersistent to random walk to antipersistent to persistent
          across the lags. This general trend is less clear for the ALL
          data set, with random walk behaviour dominating at lags of 7
          and above. Notice too that the error bars for H<sub>local</sub> for both
          data sets are quite large. This demonstrates the large
          variability in convergence towards a mean local scaling
          exponent. This is partly a function of small data sets, with
          L=256 and the fact that at longer lags the cross-correlation
          falls away sharply between nearest neighbour regions separated
          by a defined lag.
          
  
<h3>        Biological Implications
</h3>  
          The biological implications of antipersistent scaling at short
          lags suggests one hypothesis that nearest neighbour hyphae are
          more likely to have alternate 'high' and 'low' local enzyme
          activity concentrations. This would be an adaptive advantage
          during enzyme expression by limiting release out of selected
          hyphae. Once in the external medium, local diffusion
          distributes the enzyme where it can perform useful work. This
          scaling correlation may also index nearest neighbour signalling
          fields, where hyphae in close proximity don't overproduce
          exo-enzymes already released by their neighbours. The breakdown
          in scaling (random walk) at shorter lags for HALF reveals a
          realistic distance estimate for the cross-correlation between
          nearest neighbour hyphae and their role in enzyme secretion.
          The small persistent scaling regions may be due to the linear
          nature of the diffusion front (out of and away from the hyphal
          tips) in a fixed area volume.
       
   
<h3>        Conclusions
</h3>  
          One should note that multifractal WPA is an alternative to
          established techniques such as the local second moment method
          to quantify the Hurst exponent in lagged windows [8]. The WPA
          method has been demonstrated using commercially available
          software (see reference 7), and although the data manipulations
          have been performed externally in a spreadsheet environment, it
          is anticipated that this algorithm will be ported to a common
          operating environment such as S-Plus running S+Wavelets. In
          addition, this multifractal algorithm is currently being
          adapted to operate on two dimensional images - extending the
          practical utility of the global 2-D Wavelet Packet method for
          Fractal Analysis outlined in recent papers [3,9,10].

<h3>      Nonlinear Diffusion - a One-Dimensional Case
</h3>  
<h4>      Animated demonstration
</h4>          
          In this demonstration, solutions of the following nonlinear
          differential equation is modelled:
          
<P align=center><img alt="[image: a nonlinear diffusion equation ]" width="158" height="59" border=3 src="beta.gif"></p>
                                         
          where beta is a function of time (t) and space-coordinate (x).
          The parameter kappa governs the nonlinearity: when kappa is
          equal to 0, a usual linear diffusion equation is recovered
          which has very well known solutions. This time, only that
          simplest case will be illustated. The quantity beta may
          represent, for instance, the magnetic field penetrating into a
          superconductor.
<p>          
          Here, the following cases can be viewed, corresponding to
          various time-dependences of the external magnetic field, H(t),
          at the surface of a flat superconductor (see also the figures):
<DL>          
<DT>      + MODE 0: External field H is a step function of time
<DT>      + MODE 1: External field has a triangle-dependence on time
<DT>      + MODE 2: External field is a periodic function of time
</dl>

                GIFs over the years have only one image per file.
                According to the <A HREF=
                "http://members.aol.com/royalef/gif87a.txt">
                technical specifications from 1987</A>, a
                GIF could have had more than one image per file, making
                it like a slide show presentation and not a single image.
                However, most programs that work with GIF are designed
                around the idea of one image per file. So the multi-image
                aspect of GIFs was forgotten. In 1989, they added timing
                and various other abilities to the GIF format, including
                transparency. Nobody used these new additions either.
                Then the Web took off. Transparency and interlacing
                became features people wanted to use and software
                companies began supporting those features.
