The cranial nerves:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The cranial nerves (with the exception of I and II)originate in the brainstem, which includes the <B>midbrain</B>,the <B>pons</B>, and the <B>medulla</B>.  The 12 cranial nervescan be divided into sensory, motor, or mixed nerves.  Overall,sensory nerve nuclei tend to be located in the lateral brainstem,while motor nuclei tend to be located medially.  Nerves with mixedsensory and motor fibers must have more than one nucleus of origin- at least one sensory (<B>afferent</B>) and one motor (<B>efferent</B>). Sometimes more than one nerve will originate from a single nucleus:for example, the sense of taste is spread across at least twonerves but merges into a single nucleus.  Finally, keep in mindthat any sensory nucleus is receiving input from the periphery,but the sensory receptor cell bodies are never in the nucleusitself.  They will always be located just outside the CNS in aganglion.  <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Here is a dorsal view of the brainstem, looking downthrough it as though it were transparent, so you can see the relativepositions of the cranial nerve nuclei.

As a result your eyes are dilated, so the physician can look inside clearly.  As a side effect, you cannot accommodate your lens (focus on close objects) which is why you can't read while you are sitting in the waiting room. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2 WIDTH=504><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">IV - the trochlear nerve</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino"> -</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">&quot;Trochlea&quot; is from the Latin word for pulley.  If you remember from gross anatomy, the superior oblique muscle loops through a pulley-like sling on its way to the back of the eye.  Hence the IVth nerve innervates the <B>superior oblique</B>.  This nucleus is also located near the midline.  It is very small, and hard to find in sections.  It looks like a crescent-notch taken out of a dark fiber bundle in the rostral pons.  The fiber bundle is the MLF, which carries eye movement signals between brainstem nuclei.</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2 WIDTH=504><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The trochlear nerve is unique for two reasons:  1) it exits the brainstem dorsally, and 2) it crosses on the way out.

The nucleus is again near the midline, but this one is in the pons.  The key landmark for finding the abducens is actually the facial nerve.  The facial nerve fibers come up to the floor of the fourth ventricle, loop around in a hairpin turn, and dive back into the pons.  The bump that they loop over is the abducens nucleus.</FONT></TD><TD WIDTH=252><BR><BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="brst4.gif"></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2 WIDTH=504><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The abducens fibers exit the pons medially and ventrally.

The trigeminal nerve:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">All <B>sensation from the face and mouth</B> is coveredby the mixed <B>trigeminal nerve</B>.  A branch of the trigeminalis injected by your dentist when you have a cavity filled.  Thetrigeminal also carries motor fibers to the <B>muscles of mastication</B>(chewing).  The most prominent of these is the masseter muscle,the hard knot in your cheek when you clench your teeth.  The functionsof the different trigeminal nuclei are extensively covered inthe &quot;Somatosensory pathways from the face&quot; section,so they will not be repeated here. <BR></FONT><CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD WIDTH=252><BR><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The <B>mesencephalic nucleus</B> is a thin ribbon of cells that runs along the fourth ventricle and cerebral aqueduct, just outside the periaqueductal grey.  </FONT></TD><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><IMG SRC="brst5.gif"></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH=252><BR><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The <B>motor nucleus</B> is located in the mid-pons, and is often hard to see.

The facial nerve:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">All of the <B>muscles of facial expression</B> areinnervated by the <B>facial nerve</B>.  It is considered a mixedcranial nerve, however, since it also carries the sensation of<B>taste</B>.  The facial nerve also carries some <B>parasympatheticfibers</B> to the salivary glands.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Recall that the facial nerve fibers loop over theabducens nucleus in the pons.  The facial nucleus itself is hardto see in a myelin stain.  The fibers of the facial nerve do notacquire their myelin (and become dark) until they arrive at thehairpin turn, so you cannot even trace them back to the nucleus. The approximate location is shown below, however.<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="brst9.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>E.  Taste:</FONT></B><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Taste</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino"> fibers, from thetaste buds, are predominantly (from the front 2/3 of the tongue,anyway) carried by the <B>facial nerve</B>.  (Keep in mind thattouch and pain sensation from the tongue is V, and motor to thetongue is XII.)  Taste from the back of the tongue and palateis carried by the <B>glossopharyngeal nerve</B>.  Regardless oftheir origin, the taste fibers enter the <B>solitary tract</B>of the medulla, and synapse in the surrounding <B>solitary nucleus</B>. <BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="brst10.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Taste and touch sensation at the back of the throatare carried by the glossopharyngeal nerve, and also synapse inthe solitary nucleus.

Hearing and balance:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The VIIIth nerve carries <B>auditory</B> informationfrom the <B>cochlea</B> and <B>vestibular</B> information fromthe <B>semicircular canals, utricle, </B>and<B> saccule</B>. It is really two nerves running together, the auditory (cochlear)nerve and the vestibular nerve.  The VIIIth nerve is very importantclinically because a common type of tumor, the acoustic neuroma,can arise from the nerve as it exits the brainstem.  </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The cochlear nuclei are like small hands draped overthe inferior cerebellar peduncles (ICP), and are fairly smallin primates.  The vestibular nuclei have several subdivisions,however, and extend throughout a large fraction of the pons.<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="brst11.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>G.  The glossopharyngeal nerve:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The IXth nerve has no real nucleus to itself.  Insteadit shares nuclei with VII and X.  The sensory information in IXgoes to the <B>solitary nucleus</B>, a nucleus it shares withVII and X.  All motor information, essentially the innervationof the stylopharyngeus muscle, comes from the <B>nucleus ambiguus</B>,also shared with X.  Finally, like VII, there are some parasympatheticfibers in IX that innervate the salivary glands.  <BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>H.  Salivation:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The salivation center is a pair of nuclei locatedjust rostral to the dorsal nucleus of the vagus, the <B>superior</B>and <B>inferior salivatory nuclei</B>.  They supply the parasympatheticinnervation of the various salivary glands, and send their axonsthrough the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves.  <BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>I.  The various and sundry nucleiof the vagus:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">When you think vagus, you tend to think parasympathetic- this is a flashback to your gross anatomy days.  However, thevagus has dozens of functions.  They can be grouped into aboutthree categories, and each category is associated with a medullarynucleus.  The first is the <B>nucleus ambiguus</B>, which is amotor nucleus.  Cells in the nucleus ambiguus are very difficultto see (hence the name), and innervate striated muscle throughoutthe neck and thorax.  This includes some muscles of the palateand pharynx, muscles of the larynx, and the parasympathetic innervationof the heart.  Problems with the vagus can show up as hoarseness,or a deviated uvula:  X elevates the palate when you open up andsay &quot;AH&quot;.  An asymmetrical uvula would indicate thatX is not working on one side.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The second is the <B>dorsal nucleus of the vagus</B>,which is the <B>secretomotor</B> parasympathetic nucleus.  Secretomotorprimarily means that it stimulates glands - including mucus glandsof the pharynx, lungs, and gut, as well as gastric glands in thestomach.  (Incidentally, it is fair-inks, not far-nicks.)<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The third is the sensory nucleus of the vagus, the<B>solitary nucleus</B>.  As we have seen, it receives taste information,sensation from the back of the throat, and also visceral sensation. Visceral sensation includes blood pressure receptors, blood-oxygenreceptors, sensation in the larynx and trachea, and stretch receptorsin the gut.<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="brst12.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>J.  The spinal accessory nerve:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The XIth nerve actually originates in the <B>cervicalspinal cord</B>.  Were it not for the fact that it sneaks up alongside the medulla and exits the skull with IX and X, it might noteven be a cranial nerve.  It is a motor nerve that innervatestwo muscles: the <B>trapezius</B> and the <B>sternocleidomastoid</B>.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>K.  The hypoglossal nerve:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The XIIth nerve innervates the muscles of the tongue. Like most pure motor nuclei, the XII nucleus is located alongthe midline, and can be found throughout most of medulla.  Thetongue muscles actually push the tongue forward, so a problemwith the hypoglossal nerve can be detected by asking the patientto stick out his tongue.  The tongue will deviate towards theweak side, towards the side of the lesion.</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="brst13.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>L.  Information overload!!</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">If your head is spinning, it could be your vestibularnerve, but it could also be the sheer volume of information. This is a fairly superficial look at the cranial nerves; the detailsand subtleties could fill a book (and has, many times - an excellentone is <U>Cranial Nerves</U>, by Wilson-Pauwels, Akesson, andStewart).  For now, you should know a single phrase or two thatdescribes the <U>main</U> function of each cranial nerve - justenough to be able to effectively test each nerve.  Evidence ofnerve damage could mean a peripheral lesion in the nerve, or acentral lesion in the brainstem.
