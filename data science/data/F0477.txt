move to .NET.  It covers five basic areas
<br><br>
(1) An introduction to C#<br>
(2) Creating Windows Forms applications using the UI Framework and
data-bound controls<br>
(3) Building ASP.NET applications<br>
(4) Creating Web Services<br>
(5) Component Usage (Assemblies, Signing/Versioning, COM Interoperability,
Threads)<br>
<br><br>
With such a wide breadth of coverage, the authors don't try to go into a
large amount of detail about any one topic.  The sections on C# and Windows
Forms are both relatively good and go into more detail than the others.  I
got the impression that the authors felt more comfortable on these topics
than on the more web oriented sections of the book which are presented as a
shorter introduction.
<br><br>
The material is oriented towards intermediate and advanced developers who
already have some experience with object oriented programming using C++ (or
Java).  The language is clean and to the point and quickly gets into the
meat of each topic.  The examples are mostly good, however some of the later
ones are a bit long considering the introductory nature of the book.  The
code for the book is available at http://www.samspublishing.com (although
this is not mentioned in the book)
<br><br>
There are a couple of pleasant surprises in the book.  One interesting
chapter explains how the Microsoft Intermediate Language (IL) works and the
authors also provide a couple of examples using the IL Assembler.  Another
is the chapter on using Managed Extensions to C++ which gives an
introduction to integrating both legacy and new C++ code with C# and .NET.
<br><br>
I'll probably use this book over the next few months as I move up the .NET
learning curve.  However, I'll probably get some more sophisticated
reference books to supplement this one.
<br><br>
I wouldn't recommend this as a general reference, or to people without a
background in object oriented programming using either C++ or Java.  In
particular, if you are a VB programmer trying to learn C#, I'd keep looking.
However, for C++ or Java programmers looking for an introduction to .NET
using C# this book is a pretty good place to start.
