    <td><font SIZE="2">Under the CJA supporters no longer have the right to peacefully protest
    about what is happening at their club. Fans can now expect yet more body searches on their
    way to matches, face a criminal record for selling on a spare ticket, be arrested for
    joining in with lively chanting and have their DNA samples forcibly extracted and logged
    on to a national database. <p>If all that wasn't bad enough, the Government is still
    considering a national identity card scheme. Consider this - you're at a game shouting at
    your team for playing badly - next thing you know you're arrested under the
    &quot;intentional harassment&quot; laws, dragged off to the station, samples taken and
    your identity card electronically marked. Next time you try and go to football you find
    yourself barred.</p>
    <p>Sounds far fetched? Tell that to the fans who've been arrested and charged just for
    selling single spare tickets to fellow fans at cost price...</p>
    <p>We're now planning a &quot;Bust Card&quot; to be given out at all grounds. This will
    detail what rights you have when arrested and offer details of a network of sympathetic
    lawyers.</p>
    <p>We need your help on this one - donations, help with distribution , liasing with the
    local press, materials, stationery, rattling a cash bucket on matchdays, whatever!</p>
    <p>Write to us and tell us what you can do.</p>
    <p>We're also working on a Charter of Rights for football fans which will establish the
    rights of fans to enjoy their game without harassment and intimidation.</p>
    <p>We need your feedback and your ideas. Please get in touch with your experiences and
    thoughts. </p>
    <p>We have no funding whatsoever and we're doing this because we care passionately about
    what's happening to our game.</p>
