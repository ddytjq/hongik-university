Biological-like evolution-understood as aprocess that involves both the origination of novel entities, and the adaptationand modification of those entities through mutation, replication, andselection-is seen as fundamental to the behavior of diverse non-biologicalsystems. Implementations of evolutionary strategies are widely used as the basisof novel computational optimization techniques.  Broadly defined, evolutionarystrategies are also seen as a central mechanism of social and cultural change.</p><p>The multiple interpretations of, and roles attributed to, evolution have expandedour understanding of the term far beyond that envisaged by Darwin and otherevolutionary biologists. In order to integrate the piecemeal and ofteninconsistent notions of evolutionary processes, and to develop a generalframework for understanding them, SFI is establishing this new scientificinitiative. It is intended to serve as a source of catalysis, synthesis, andinnovation for the scientific community interested in evolutionary processes.</p><p>An integrated approach will combine general theoretical investigations withdetailed case studies of the mechanisms and phenomenology of evolution in bothbiological and non-biological systems. The approach will emphasize the search forgeneral principles of evolutionary dynamics, general organizational principles,and behavioral commonalities of systems undergoing evolutionary change. Equallyimportant to the approach is a respect for the details and subtleties of specificphenomena, and an emphasis on understanding how and why evolutionary processesdiffer in diverse contexts. The extent to which biological evolution is valid anduseful as a metaphor for other forms of evolution will be an explicit focus.</p><b>Synthesizing Two Central Questions</b><br><br><p>The program's scientific approach will be based on the belief that anunderstanding of the origins and nature of complexity will bring a novelperspective to the study of evolutionary dynamics. Implicit in the emphasis oncomplexity is a recognition of its importance in addressing two questions SFIsees as central to evolutionary dynamics:</p><p><font size="+1">How do entities with complex organizational structure and function arise anddevelop, and what organizations are attainable given specific kinds oflower-level constituent entities?</font></p><p>What are the dynamical features characteristic of populations of mutatingentities capable of replication and subject to selection?</p><p>This initiative is singular in taking the synthesis of the above two questions asits basic perspective. The importance of the first question has been longrecognized, but has not been systematically pursued. The second question has beenan active subject of research for many decades, especially in the field ofpopulation genetics, but has been typically considered in a context decoupledfrom the first.</p><p>By focusing on this synthesis, the program will contribute in a fundamental wayto an understanding of the nature of organisms and organizations that arisethrough the dynamics of the process of evolution; in other words, to contributeto what Leo Buss (evolutionary biology, Yale University, and author of TheEvolution of Individuality) has called a "theory of the possible."  With asynthetic approach, for example, successions of evolutionary innovations will beunderstood not as isolated events, but in terms of how each innovation affectsthe potential-in both an organizational and a dynamical sense-for futureinnovation.</p><p>The long-range goal of the program is to combine our understanding ofevolutionary dynamics and organizational principles so as to understand whichfeatures of a phenomenon-in natural, computational, or social systems-arenecessary consequences of internal organization, and which are consequences ofthe particular histories of environment and selection to which thoseorganizations were exposed.</p>The program will be structured around the following multiple researchthemes:<br><br><font size="+1"><li> Evolution of complex structure and form<br><li> Dynamics of evolutionary search<br><li> Molecular and genetic insights into evolution <br><li> Evolutionary, developmental, and ecological 	aspects of biodiversity; and<br><li> Social and cultural evolution. <br></font><br> <p>The first two themes address general theoretical issues relating to the twocentral questions of organization and dynamics. The next three focus on "casestudies" for which the goal is to address organization and dynamics byinvestigating the details of the specific evolutionary processes, by buildingtheoretical and computational models that capture their salient features, and byvalidating these models against experimental and empirical data.</p><p>Activities within each research theme will include collaborative researchprojects, visitor programs, working groups, and educational activities. Theprogram as a whole will also support workshops and group meetings that areexpressly designed to address issues that cut across the themes. Suggestions forspecific research activities are being considered now. Participation in researchthemes is expected to evolve over time, and proposals for new themes will besolicited from the general scientific community on an ongoing basis. Inparticular, the Institute recognizes that many individuals and researchcommunities that are important sources of expertise in evolutionary phenomena arenot currently active in SFI research programs, and SFI is committed toidentifying and recruiting the best of those individuals and communities into theresearch activities as they develop.</p><b>Evolution of Complex Structure and Form</b><br><br><p>Central emphasis will be on theory and model development focusing on majorevolutionary transitions involving the evolution of complex structure and form.Such transitions, as identified by John Maynard Smith and Eors Szathmary, forexample, involve aggregation of previously separately reproducing units, theemergence of specialization, or the origins of cooperation and collectivebehavior. Examples include the transitions from unicellularity tomulticellularity, and the aggregation of individuals into villages.</p><p>Such a theory, if it could be developed, might lead not only to models thatexhibit the features of major evolutionary transitions, but also to predictionsfor (i) the circumstances under which these transitions occur, (ii) measurablecharacteristics of the state of systems poised to undergo such transitions, (iii)the sensitivity of the transitional process to historical accidents, and (iv) thestability of the new entities that are thereby produced. The goal is tounderstand not only the dynamics of transitions, but also the organization of theentities that enable these transitions. An essential component of any such theoryis an understanding of the kinds of organizations and phenomena to which thetheory may not apply.</p><p>Work will focus on modeling one aspect of the formation and variation of newentities; namely, the interactions between agents and the aggregates they form.An example of a specific collaboration that may be sponsored by the program isthe work by Leo Buss and Walter Fontana (chemistry, SFI) on developing aformalism for describing self-maintaining organized networks of molecularreactions. The formalism that is needed for this problem is one in which theconstituent entities have the ability to modify each other and to change fromwithin, and in this sense differs from the formalisms provided by traditionaldynamical systems approaches. Research on this effort will focus on developing anappropriate model based on functional calculus, and investigating the functionalorganizations that emerge in a many-body setting, such as a chemical flowreactor.</p><p>Research on the evolution of complex structure and function will be coordinatedby Walter Fontana and John Padgett (political science, University of Chicago).</p><b>Dynamics of Evolutionary Search</b><br><br><p>The dynamics of evolutionary search, in both natural and social systems,represents the second major component of the program.  This project will explorethe generic features of evolutionary processes in order to develop a theoreticalbasis for an understanding of adaptive dynamics. It will analyze observableprocesses and relate them to the repertoire of attainable solutions that areconstrained by the particular realization of evolutionary dynamics. Specificresearch problems include the phenomenon of epochal evolution, the adaptiveadvantages of recombination, and the dynamics of coevolving systems. Questions tobe addressed include conditions for stepwise rather than gradual evolutionaryadaptation; the role of selectively neutral variants in adaptation; andtrade-offs and scaling relationships among genome complexity, rates of geneticvariation, and population size.</p>This work will directly draw upon the research in the other topics in the programincluding the formation of new entities, evolution of RNA secondary structure,originations and extinctions, and evolution in social and cultural contexts. Asis true in the first theme, a key question to be addressed will be the interplayof organizational principles, historical accidents, random changes over time, andDarwinian forces such as natural selection.<p>Work in this area will be coordinated by Jim Crutchfield (physics, SFI), MarcFeldman (population genetics, Stanford University), and Peter Schuster (molecularbiology, University of Vienna).</p><b>Molecular and Genetic Insights into Evolution</b><br><br><p><img src="images/geek.gif" align=left border="0" hspace="4" vspace="4"><br clear="all"><br>The focus of this theme will be on biological systems that provide insight intogenotype-phenotype mappings. The work on evolution of RNA molecules, for example,incorporates a study of landscape features, variational constraints, andselective boundary conditions in the development of models for macromoleculargenotype-phenotype mappings. By combining theoretical, simulational, andexperimental results, a description of the evolutionary process is emerging thatexplains, for example, the causes of major structural transitions in RNA andconsequent evolutionary jumps. This work will build on this new understanding ofthe evolutionary process to focus on the analysis of predictability in evolution,to address questions of prebiotic evolution, and to make comparisons withartificial systems that perform evolutionary computation.</p><p>A second component of the research will focus on evolution of robustness inorganismal design. The basic observation motivating this research theme is thatorganisms appear to be surprisingly robust to genetic and environmentalperturbations. The evolutionary origins of robustness, as well as the biologicalmechanisms that maintain it, remain largely unexplored. This research componentof the program will coordinate studies of robustness relating to geneticperturbations and to secondary RNA structure to address questions including: Whatare the origins of robustness in cellular biology and development? And what arethe mechanisms by which robustness is achieved?</p><p>A final component will focus on the evolution of the immune system. The immunesystem is highly instructive in the ability it has evolved to coordinate adaptiveprocesses at the molecular and cellular levels, including somatic mutation,clonal selection, and affinity maturation, so as to generate useful behavior-suchas recognition of a pathogen-at the level of the organism. The immune systemresearch effort will develop models and test hypotheses of how the system as awhole has evolved its sophisticated pattern recognition and information storagecapabilities. The fundamental question is to understand the evolutionarymechanisms that enable an immune system with limited genetic resources to attainvery broad pathogen set coverage.</p><p>The research effort on dynamics of evolutionary search will also be coordinatedby Jim Crutchfield, Marc Feldman, and Peter Schuster.</p><b>Evolutionary, Developmental, and Ecological Aspects of Biodiversity</b> <br><br><p>A major focus of this research will be on the interplay between internalevolutionary dynamics of an ecosystem, on the one hand, and externalenvironmental stresses, on the other, in leading to extinctions. A second majorthrust will be on understanding the interplay of extinction withmacroevolutionary dynamics. A mass extinction event, for instance, may clear theway for the adaptive radiation of a new group of organisms, such as the mammalsin the aftermath of the end-Cretaceous extinction, but it may also wipe out manyspecies that were in other respects well-adapted. The objective will be toexplore the ways in which extinction can help or hinder the development ofsuccessful species, and the type of organization one will expect to see in anecosystem subject to regular extinction.</p><p>The study of extinctions will be closely related to a study of originations andto the diversity of biological forms. Research on origination will focus on thedynamics of novelty generation in evolution, on the nature of major episodes ofdiversification, and on recoveries from major extinction events. Research on thediversity of biological form will focus on phenotypic variation as an arena inwhich to explore generic and specific properties of the genotype-phenotype map,and the general issue of the relationship between development and evolution.Current objectives include the identification of developmental constraints onform and structure, as well as of asymmetries in the temporal manifestation ofsuch constraints.</p><p>The final component of the biodiversity theme focuses on ecological complexity,and, in particular, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function.The assemblage and self-maintenance of ecosystems represent outstanding problemsin understanding the evolution of complex entities. How do the organizationalprinciples of ecosystems differ from those of biological organisms?Unquestionably, ecosystems show regularities in structure and function acrossregions. An essential first step, therefore, is to catalogue the similarities anddifferences among and across systems, and then to understand which of thepatterns that one finds are uniquely determined by regional climate and soilconditions, for example, and which are the result of internal dynamics includingselective processes acting at the level of individual agents. An outstandingchallenge will be to compare the organizational and dynamical features ofecosystems with those of biological organisms-the differences in this regard willbe as interesting as the commonalities. An engaging question that the program maybe positioned in the future to address is the relation between evolutionaryprocesses that take place on long time scales and ecological processes that takeplace on relatively short time scales, and the possibility of a syntheticapproach to these two sets of problems.</p><p>Research on evolutionary, developmental, and ecological aspects of biodiversitywill be coordinated by Gunther Eble (paleontology, SFI/Smithsonian Institution),Simon Levin (biology, Princeton University), and Mark Newman (physics, SFI).</p><b>Social and Cultural Evolution</b><br><br><p>The theoretical focus of this research will be on the question of whether theperspective of evolutionary dynamics can assist in explaining social and culturaltransformations. To this end, the research will address some detailed mechanismsand large-scale patterns characteristic of social and cultural change. Forexample, the mechanisms of cultural transmission will be compared to those ofgenetic transmission with the aim of understanding the implications of thecommonalities and differences for the emergence, diffusion, and extinction ofpopulation-level change. As a second example, the research will consider thepossibility that the human and social context can amplify the consequences ofevolutionary factors such as differences between in-group and between-groupvariances so as to lead to results different than would be expected in biologicalcontexts.</p><p>How human behaviors have evolved to support cooperation, generosity, andreciprocity among non-kin is a question to be considered in the future.</p><p>This theme will be coordinated by Sam Bowles (economics, University ofMassachusetts), Marc Feldman, and Tim Kohler (archaeology, Washington StateUniversity).</p></small></font>	</td>	</tr>	</table></body></html>
