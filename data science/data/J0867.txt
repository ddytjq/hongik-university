<h1>Mid America Raceways</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Mid America Raceway is a 2.89 mile course with varying elevation changes, a 
very long straight, and ten corners, 7 right and 3 left turns. There are 11 
flag stations, #11 being on the straight after the driveover bridge near the 
end of the dragstrip.  MAR has a dragstrip that is slightly short. I am not 
sure but I believe it is 1200 feet, so no records can be recorded, only
racing. 
The dragstrip also has its run-off area downhill, so there is a strong need 
for good brakes.
</p>
<p>
Mid America is located West of St. Louis, MO, between Highways
61 and 70l.  The drag strip is still in active use but there are no
events using the road course at the present time.

<h2><a name="HistoricalNote">Historical Note</a></h2>

MAR was built in late 1965 and was the site of the second SCCA Trans Am race
in 
the spring of 1966. The first Trans Am was at Sebring in March, 1966.  Over the
years, MAR has hosted many drag races and road races. St. Louis Region ran its
National and Regional races until 1984 when MAR closed its doors to road racing
and St. Louis International Raceway opened its new road course in 1985. St.
Louis International is now

<h2><a name="GettingThere">Getting to MAR</a></h2>

From St. Louis and the East, take I70 to Wentzville. Continue west past US 
61 to Pierce Road exit. It is the one with McDonald's, Burger King, and an 
Amoco Station. Get on the frontage road on the north side and continue west. 
For those without a compass, exit I70, make a right, and then a left. You are 
going away from McDonald's. <p>

Continue until you reach Point Prairie Road. There is a small sign for MAR, 
about 4 foot by 6 foot, in attention-getting black and white.<p>

Follow Point Prairie Road for about 6 miles or so. You will drop in an esse 
curve into a gully and see the signs that point you to spectator and entrant 
entrances (1 on map). Continue straight, do not turn left. Go over the hill 
and down to the bottom, where you will find an extremely rough rock driveway 
heading back uphill on your left (2). If you cross the creek, you missed it. 
Drive up the driveway to the barn (3), where registration is held. After getting

your credientials, follow the rock road down to the driveover bridge. Cross 
the bridge (9) and drive alongside the track to the paddock (10). Only during 
spectator events is there anyone at the gate.<p>
<h2><a name="TrackDesc">Track Description</a></h2>
<p>
This seems rather silly, since there isn't any road racing there anymore, but 
maybe this will spur some interest in getting the track re-opened to road racing

again. MAR was a drivers course, full of challenge and always fun to drive. 
there was a very laid back atmosphere there with plenty of camping space.
Facilities were poor, but then that was over ten years ago.
</p>
<p>
On the main straight, you leave the pits and pull out just before the walk-over 
bridge and turn 1, a 90 degree right-hander that has a concrete. The road course

runs clockwise, so you are headed south. there is a drainage ditch that runs 
south across turn 1, so you have a dip just past the apex.<p>

From Turn 1, you are headed into a long , fast sweeper of Turn 2. In many cars, 
you are in fourth gear and going quite fast, as it is possible to enter turn 
1 about 90 mph and exit with considerable speed. this sweeper is a slow downhill

run, also. <p>

The Sweeper straightens out in the bottom between the trees and heads into 
turn 3, a sharp right-hander that heads uphill on the exit. A slight bend is 
in the straight between turns 3 and 4 but in most cars, you never notice it. 
This section is quite rough and a softer than normal suspension settings help 
to keep the car from skipping around too much.<p>

Turn 4 is a large decreasing radius carousel with the peak of the hill about 
where the apex is. It is also very fast and those who misjudge the length of 
the corner can run off about the apex and find the tire wall protecting the 
paddock. those who misjudge only slightly can find themselves running off before

the trackout point and running downhill through the grass towards the spectator 
areas.<p>

You leave Turn 4 and head slightly downhill and slightly bending left to turn 
5 which bends sharply to the left but not a full 90 degree turn. The track 
also makes an abrupt downhill change and drops you quickly into Turn 6 at the 
bottom, a very sharp right-hander that turns about 120 degrees. <p>

Turn 6 has a large run-off area before reaching the trees, but at some Corvette 
events, there were a few who crossed that expanse and entered the trees, to 
disappear far within. Trees have been cut to get them out. Now there were no 
signs of skid marks and it appeared that the drivers suffered brain fade and 
just drove off, but it is something to consider since you carry a lot of speed 
into turn 6 and are running downhill.<p>

From 6 you head down a short straight, hill on the right and open field on 
the left. There is enough room to get around some slower cars here, if you 
are quick.   You enter Turn 7, a flat right-hander. You get another short
straight into Turn 8, a flat carousel that can be double apexed and is
surprisingly big. In this area, you will notice some signs with Xs on them that
mark the locations of stumps. If you go off, avoid this signs.<p>

Out of turn 8 you have a short straight, then a bend to the right for another 
straight into turn 9, a 90 degree right-hander. You run down a fair straight 
to turn 10, also a flat 90 degree right-hander. Your trackout point from 10 
is unnervingly close to the abutment for the driveover bridge and has collected 
more than one car. Be careful.<p>

At the bridge, you begin climbing back up the end of the dragstrip. As you 
clear the trees near the bridge, you find Turn 11at the end of the trees, which 
really isn't a turn but just a flag station. shortly past this, you will reach 
the peak of the hill and the straight. Pit entrance is on your right. In most 
cars, you should be near your top speed and still have at least an eighth of 
a mile to turn 1.  This completes one lap.<p>

A/Prod cars were turning about 2:02 laps and an F/Atlantic (F5000) had the
record at 1:58.  E/Prod was around 2:17.


<h2>Hazards and Other Cautions</h2>

In many of the fields that surround the track, there are crops planted or there 
are tree stumps remaining. the stumps have been marked with small square signs 
with an X painted on them. Some stumps are low enough to drive over, but don't 
count on it. Avoid them.  <p>

Turn 1 has a bluff on the outside near the trackout point. Since there is a 
drainage ditch that upsets the suspension, many cars end up trying to climb 
the embankment. The Bilstein Rabbit Cup Series had many Rabbits climb part 
of the way and then land in the track on their roofs. The next car through 
would hit the nose or tail and spin them in the middle of the track.<p>

As I said, there is a drainage ditch across the track. When it rains, this 
becomes a stream of water that can cause problems.<p>
