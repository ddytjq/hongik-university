HTML=<BODY BACKGROUND="goldplastic.gif"><H3>Thor's Mighty Hammer</H3> (for those who may not know) is a travelling plaque awarded to one player voted by his peers - at one particular event -to have earned tournament Most-Valuable Player status.  That event was, andevidently still is, called the Guts Players Association Guts Frisbee WorldChampionships.<P>Previous winners of Thor's Mighty Hammer include the following Guts playersand the names of their teams:<P>1978 - Gerard Newman / Library Bar<P>1979 - Steve McLean / Foothill Pure Food & Drug Act<P>1980 - Al Bonopane / California Foothill<P> 1981 - Jim Dinser / Cupola Bandits<P>1982 - Steve Trauger / Beer City Express<P>1983 - Dave Young / Hartland Heartbreakers<P>1984 - Dave Young / Labatt's Heartbreakers<P>1985 - David Trauger / Beer City Express<P>1986 - Joe Welch / Video Sensations - Rotted Legends, Inc.<P>1987 - Art McGuff / Video Sensations<P>1988 - John Begoske / Cupola Bandits<P>1989 - Jim Dinser / Cupola Bandits<P>1990 - Gary Ciaglaski / Hard Knocks Cafe<P>1991 - Joe Brady / Cupola Bandits<P>1992 - Mike Flynn / Red Cloud<P>1993 -<P> 1994 -<P> 1995 - Bill DePetro / Marquette<P>1996 - Roger Hill / Marquette<P>1997 - Joe Welch / White's Bar<P>As for the years 1993 and 1994, I do not have information which states thattournaments called the GPA World's were held.  (Please enlighten me if I'mmistaken.)<P>For you trivia buffs, there were two players to win Thor's Mighty Hammer whodid not play on the winning teams.  My team, Beer City Express lost in thefinals to Cupola Bandits in '82 and Dow Plastics beat Mike Flynn's Red Cloudin the '92 GPA World Championships.  Wonder what will happen in 2002...<P>As for Thor's Mighty Hammer...  As a past winner, I strongly suggest that ifa Guts Frisbee World Championships tournament is held, that both trophies -Thor's Mighty Hammer AND the Jumbo Jug, the winning team trophy, stay withthe event.<P> Furthermore, I recommend that if there is no specific event to be foreverknown to all as the Guts Frisbee World Championships tournament, then eachsubsequent year, one of the other Pro Guts Players Circuit (or whatever thatyear's Guts Frisbee tournament calendar of events is called) events shall beselected (possibly by random draw) to be advertised, played, and rememberedas that year's Guts Frisbee World Championships tournament.<P>  As some of you may remember, IFT for a number of years was also known as GutsFrisbee's World Championships.<P>Guts IS Catchin'!<P>Steve Trauger<P>
