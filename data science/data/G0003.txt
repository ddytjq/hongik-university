  Introduction </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let me begin by 
  asking the question: where does astronomy education take place in the United 
  States and Canada? I suspect many of you who teach would say, it takes place 
  in classrooms just like mine. But I want to argue that astronomy education happens 
  in many other places as well: <br>
  </font></p>
<ul>
  <li> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> it happens 
    in hundreds of planetariums and museums </font> 
  <li> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> it happens 
    at meetings of amateur astronomers around the country </font> 
  <li> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> it happens 
    in front of television and radio sets (and, alas, less and less frequently, 
    when someone reads a good astronomy story in a newspaper) </font> 
  <li> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> it happens 
    when someone reads a popular book on astronomy, or leafs through a science 
    magazine </font> 
  <li> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> it happens 
    in youth groups taking an overnight hike and learning about the stars </font> 
  <li> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> it happens 
    when someone surfs the astronomy resources on the internet. </font> 
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is not to 
  say that the classroom is not a vital and large part of the puzzle. In the U.S. 
  for example, formal education is a big business. At all levels, from kindergarten 
  to college, the U.S. in 1997 enrolled 67 million students -- 38 million in grades 
  K-8, 14 million in grades 9-12, and 15 million in colleges and universities. 
  The entire U.S. educational system employs almost 5 million teachers and other 
  staff. The annual cost of the U.S. educational enterprise is almost $500 billion, 
  about 8% of our gross domestic product. Are we getting our money's worth? </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1988, the Public 
  Opinion Laboratory at Northern Illinois University, conducted a survey of a 
  representative sample of 2,041 American adults to get a sense of their scientific 
  literacy. Among the 75 basic science questions was one about the Earth: <br>
  </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Does the Earth 
    go around the Sun or the Sun around the Earth? 21% got it wrong and 7% said 
    they did not know </font> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
    <br>
    2. The 72% who got it right were then asked what period of time the trip took. 
    45% got it right, 17% said 1 day, 2% said one month, 8% said they did not 
    know. </font> </p>
</blockquote>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This means 94 
  million people in our country could not correctly say that the Earth went around 
  the Sun AND that it took a year to do so. And astronomy is not alone in being 
  a field about which Americans know little. The Carnegie Commission on Science, 
  Technology and Government reported in 1991 that 47% of US 17-year olds could 
  not convert 9 parts of ten to a percentage and that (in a multiple choice survey) 
  63% of adult Americans thought that lasers work by focusing sound waves. [Reported 
  in Beardsley, T. "Teaching Real Science" in Scientific American, Oct. 1992, 
  p. 98.] </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In September 1993, 
  the Dept. of Education issued the report of a survey on adult literacy in the 
  U.S. In one question, those in the survey were given a calculator, were told 
  the cost a carpet per square yard, and were given the size of a room. The question 
  was, how much should carpet cost to cover the entire room. Even with a calculator, 
  96% of those interviewed could NOT do it correctly. [See Barber, B. "America 
  Skips School" in Harper's, Nov. 1993, p. 39.] </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That's one part 
  of our problem; here is another. In June 1990, the Gallup organization conducted 
  a national survey of beliefs among adult Americans. About one in four said they 
  believed in the basic premise of astrology, and 74% read their horoscopes at 
  least occasionally. 47% thought that UFO's are real, and 27% thought that aliens 
  have actually touched down and visited the Earth. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now you may laugh 
  at the notion of taking this kind of belief seriously. But if a large number 
  of our citizens (and even our leaders) believes that our lives are governed 
  by magic and superstition, will they feel the same urgency we do about the need 
  for more science and technology education to solve the difficult problems of 
  our age? And if you don't believe that such fiction sciences have an influence, 
  I should perhaps just remind you of the revelation during the Reagan administration, 
  that a San Francisco astrologer named Joan Quigley was given control over the 
  president's schedule during much of his time in the White House. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What makes this 
  kind of widespread belief in pseudoscience and widespread ignorance about science 
  possible? Greedy and ignorant media, cynical publishers, and scientists sticking 
  their heads in the sand all bear some of the responsibility, but our system 
  of education is certainly a main culprit. Many teachers, especially at the elementary 
  level, just don't have adequate training in science and the scientific method. 
  Thus it is a lot easier and less frightening for them to teach as little science 
  as possible or to teach science out of the textbook. And many high schools in 
  the U.S. spent the 1980's relaxing their requirements and offerings in science 
  to the point where we might say they are not just relaxed, they're ASLEEP. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1986, the National 
  Science Teachers' Association surveyed the high school teaching scene. To take 
  one example, of the 24,000 high school in the US, about 1/3 offered no physics 
  course at all. Many of the courses that were offered in physics are taught by 
  teachers whose training is in some other field. And of the physics teachers, 
  82% taught only two or one physics classes in a school year! In the decade since 
  this survey, some tightening of standards has taken place but its effect on 
  overall levels of physics literacy have been small so far. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That same survey 
  showed that in the year of the survey, only 57% of US high school students were 
  enrolled in any science class! 43% were taking no science at all that year! 
  Of the 1990 graduating class, fewer than 50% took a chemistry class, and about 
  20% took physics. (In more recent surveys, this rose to about 24%, touted by 
  some observers as a marvelous step forward!) Contrast that with other countries 
  where students take three science classes every year of high school. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A 1985 survey 
  by the Stanford School of Education revealed an interesting fact about the roots 
  of the problem. A typical elementary school student in the US spends about 25 
  hours per week in instructional activities (that by itself is sobering). But 
  of those 25 hours, how much time does a student spend on science? What would 
  you guess ... a fifth, an eighth? The answer turned out to be 44 minutes or 
  about 3% -- and much of that on learning vocabulary rather than discovering 
  ideas. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But I want to 
  follow these sobering statistics with a positive thought: survey after survey 
  reveals that when students are asked what topic in science is most interesting 
  to them, the top two winners are consistently dinosaurs and outer space. The 
  fascination of astronomy is a powerful tool for engaging the intellect and imagination 
  of our youngsters, and this is what encourages us to work to make it part of 
  the positive school experience of every child. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Nor do I want 
  to imply that the public is necessarily uniformly hostile toward astronomy (or 
  even science). There is by all indications a tremendous hunger among many people 
  in this country to share in the excitement of scientific discovery and to know 
  more about the fruits of scientific exploration. And astronomy seems to be near 
  the top of the list of topics the public is eager to learn more about. The problem 
  is more that this hunger is so often left unsatisfied, that the meager meal 
  of science gruel set before the public by our educational system and the media, 
  leaves them like Oliver Twist, dreaming of a richer repast. </font></p>

  </font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> So let us turn 
  from this very quick taste of the problem to the places where solutions might 
  be expected. Some of the programs I will mention briefly below are described 
  in more detail in the Catalog of National Astronomy Education Projects that 
  we have compiled for Project ASTRO (see the web site: <a href="naep.html">National 
  Astronomy Education Projects</a>). I've divided the places where astronomy education 
  takes place into six broad (and somewhat arbitrary) areas:<br>
  </font></p>
<ul>
  <li> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">graduate education 
    </font>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#6666CC"><b><a name="3"></a>3. 
  Graduate Education </b></font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> According to the 
  American Institute of Physics, there were about 175 astronomy and astrophysics 
  PhD's in 1995. Some estimates are that once they are done with their post-doctoral 
  positions (which are still plentiful), and begin searching for permanent jobs, 
  perhaps half will end up in non-traditional astronomy careers because permanent 
  academic or research jobs in our field are so scarce. And even those who are 
  in traditional astronomy careers will increasingly be asked to communicate the 
  results of their work to students, funders, and the public.<br>
  </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> What kind of 
  job are we doing in training these graduates of our programs for their future 
  in the competitive world of 21st century science? Many scientific and engineering 
  disciplines (as well as the National Academy of Science) are taking a new look 
  at this question and beginning to urge university departments to broaden the 
  skills with which their students emerge from graduate school. In astronomy, 
  the American Astronomical Society in the early 1990's appointed an Astronomy 
  Education Policy Board, which took on as its first task a nationwide re-examination 
  of graduate training in our field. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Astronomer Eugene 
  Levy, Dean of Science at the University of Arizona, in an eloquent introduction 
  to one of the workshops this Board held on the future of graduate education, 
  pointed out that in this era of shrinking opportunities, academia has for the 
  most part adopted "a posture of studied denial" about the problem. He reminded 
  the group that we have lived through several decades of tremendous growth in 
  both research institutions and colleges and universities in this country. This 
  growth has been fueled both by generous federal spending on science and by the 
  fact that, as a B.A. degree has replaced the high school diploma as the minimum 
  qualifier for many jobs, many more people have gone to college. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The expansion 
  of research funding and higher education has allowed our country to absorb a 
  very high - much greater than replacement level - growth in the number of PhD's. 
  If the growth in research support or the expansion of universities slows (as 
  it now appears to be doing), we will quickly have an oversupply of PhD's in 
  science - just as we already do in some areas of the humanities, for example. 
  </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There are several 
  reasons why today's and tomorrow's PhD's in astronomy may find a broader training 
  in science education and communication useful. As we shall see, even those who 
  find traditional research-oriented jobs in our field will increasingly be called 
  upon to participate in educational outreach. Universities are placing increasing 
  teaching demands on their faculty. NASA has begun requiring an educational component 
  to all their future missions and is placing emphasis on how scientists can get 
  involved in leveraging their work for maximum educational benefit. NSF has announced 
  that future research grant proposals will also be evaluated on their value to 
  the nation. And those scientists who obtain jobs in the corporate sector will 
  find that many companies value and reward such abilities as working well within 
  teams, communicating results and proposals effectively, and getting involved 
  in community service to education. Ultimately, some observers are even predicting 
  that Congress or NSF may make continued funding of research in universities 
  and laboratories contingent on these institutions becoming actively involved 
  in assisting K-12 education. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Yet, despite 
  these signs on the horizon, the culture of most of our astronomy departments 
  today clearly follows the research goal: research skill is what is sought out, 
  research skill is what is rewarded. Little attention is paid in most departments 
  to teaching or to making contributions to education in other ways. In some departments, 
  students or faculty members who do take an active interest in education are 
  quietly warned that it may negatively affect their chances for future success, 
  tenure, and promotion. Indeed, graduate school often manages to convey to research 
  students that having to teach is a minor irritant in one's research career that 
  any smart person can learn to put up with, doing the minimum one can. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A few departments 
  make a serious effort to help their students become better teachers, but most 
  follow the old prescription for how you teach a kid to swim: throw a graduate 
  student into a pool of lukewarm students and let him fend for himself - he'll 
  soon get the hang of it! A graduate student -- often in his or her very first 
  year - is simply assigned to be a teaching assistant and told (explicitly or 
  implicitly) that teaching is something they can pick up on their own. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This unfortunately 
  means that in many introductory undergraduate courses around the country, the 
  first person non-science students have close contact with in astronomy turns 
  out to be a nervous graduate student who is mostly unprepared for that contact. 
  The resulting experience is often an unsatisfying one for each side. A first 
  step in remedying this situation would be for all astronomy departments to foster 
  a sense that education has value in the training and work of astronomers that 
  is - if not equal - at least within the same order of magnitude as the value 
  they place on research. In some departments that will be harder than finding 
  a snowball on Venus; but in others, the slow winds of change are starting to 
  blow. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Hearing about 
  the difficult employment picture, some departments have started to feel that 
  giving their students a mastery of educational skills could give them a competitive 
  advantage. As more and more narrowly-focused research graduates are unable to 
  get jobs doing astronomy research, professors may come to the realization that 
  success in training their PhD's does not require that all of them turn out to 
  be clones of their advisor and his or her research colleagues. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In a few places, 
  such as the University of Chicago, graduate students themselves have begun to 
  organize educational outreach efforts into local schools. A number of graduate 
  students and post-docs around the country have joined Project ASTRO, the national 
  effort to set up partnerships between astronomers and local 4th-9th grade school 
  teachers (more on this below.) And a number of universities are now starting 
  or considering special masters programs that are not failed research PhD's, 
  but will combine astronomy and education, and specifically prepare students 
  for teaching, planetarium education, or science communication. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> These are small 
  first steps, and we, as a community, need to try and encourage more efforts 
  along these lines.</font></p>

  Undergraduate Education</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  </font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In this section, 
  I want to discuss educating non-science majors as part of some general education 
  program, and not the undergraduate education of scientists. As we saw, there 
  has been a tremendous increase in the number of people getting college degrees 
  in recent decades, something few us who took going to college for granted really 
  appreciate enough. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Before World 
  War II, only 8% of Americans went to college; today more than half will get 
  a bit of college education, and about a third actually graduate from college. 
  In 1950, about 500,000 college degrees were awarded in the country (432,000 
  bachelors, 58,000 masters, 6,000 PhD's). By 1995, 1.7 million degrees were awarded, 
  among them almost 1.2 million bachelors, 75,000 medical legal and other professional 
  degrees, 377,000 masters, 41,000 PhD's. [U.S. Dept of Education: Digest of Education 
  Statistics, 1996.] </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There are some 
  2,200 four-year colleges and universities in the U.S., plus about 1,500 two-year 
  colleges (but some of these are technical training schools, so that the number 
  of two-year colleges as we would think of them may be closer to 1200.) In 1997, 
  according to the U.S. Dept of Education, about 15 million students were enrolled 
  in some institution of higher education, from community college to research 
  university. And we keep learning beyond our younger years: In 1994-95, out of 
  a total US adult population of 190 million, the U.S. National Center for Educational 
  Statistics reported that 76 million had taken some sort of adult education or 
  training course in the last 12 months. (That's an impressive figure: almost 
  40% of the population!) </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> No one quite 
  knows how many students take an introductory astronomy course each year. I surveyed 
  textbook authors and publishers who keep track of this sort of statistics and 
  the best estimate I can come up with is that roughly 200,000 students take astronomy 
  in the U.S. per year. (The one hard figure I could get in this area was from 
  the American Institute of Physics. So far, they only survey degree granting 
  physics and astronomy institutions, and those reported in 1994-95 a combined 
  introductory astronomy enrollment of about 155,000. Given that many smaller 
  introductory courses are taught at places where physics and astronomy degrees 
  are not granted -- such as many community colleges, evening adult schools, etc., 
  this figure is in accord with the publishers' estimates.) </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> And how good 
  are the introductory survey courses we teach? How well do they convey the excitement 
  and the methods of science to undergraduates? Are the techniques and tools we 
  use to teach them appropriate to the kinds of students who are taking these 
  classes? As a new textbook author, I have spent the last two years thinking 
  about these issues and worry that we often teach our non-science majors astronomy 
  as if they were just like our science majors but without the good sense to have 
  made a wise career choice. This leaves many of them feeling alienated from science 
  and less supportive of the scientific enterprise than they might otherwise have 
  been. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In fact, the 
  reasoning ability, learning styles, and science and math preparations of our 
  general education students may now be radically different from the students 
  of even just a few decades ago and certainly from those students who choose 
  to major in astronomy or physics. Let me just mention a brief sobering thought 
  about the situation in California. We have three levels of higher education 
  in our state: the elite University of California at the top and the extensive 
  system of over 100 community colleges at the bottom. In between is the California 
  State University System (with 22 campuses and 320,000 students), where students 
  are supposed to have about a B average in high school to get in. In 1994, all 
  entering freshmen at California State Universities were given assessment tests: 
  49% were not ready in their skills for college-level English and 54% were not 
  able to perform even basic college-level math. I taught introductory astronomy 
  on one of these campuses for over 10 years and the challenges involved in reaching 
  some of these students effectively in a science class are indeed considerable. 
  </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A large fraction 
  of the introductory courses in astronomy are taught at community colleges and 
  other institutions where research is not required or expected of faculty. With 
  the help of NASA's IDEA grant program and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 
  I have begun a systematic <a href="../survey.html">survey</a> of these instructors. 
  It is interesting to note that (judging from the first 300 respondents) only 
  20% of these instructors have an astronomy degree, most do not consider themselves 
  primarily astronomers, most teach one or more other subjects, and most rarely 
  come to meetings of astronomers. Many have teaching loads of 15 units, or five 
  3-unit classes each and every semester, with small or non-existent budgets, 
  and little opportunity for professional growth. These institutions represent 
  the quiet backwater of astronomy and the instructors of these courses often 
  feel and are left out of the mainstream discussions about astronomy and astronomy 
  education. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The Astronomical 
  Society of the Pacific has begun a series of discussions and symposia at its 
  summer meetings focusing on the teaching of astronomy at non-research-oriented 
  institutions and we invite anyone with an interest in this topic to contact

  K-12 Education </b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  </font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In many ways, 
  the school system in America reminds one of Saturn's rings: from far away, it 
  looks ordered and beautiful, a testament to the organizational powers at work 
  in the system. But the minute you get inside, what you see is the chaos of countless 
  individual pieces, some colliding, some moving together, some all knotted up. 
  And what are all the pieces doing ultimately - going in circles of course! </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I've already 
  mentioned some of the serious problems in science education in our schools -- 
  those problems are, of course, only a tiny subset, of the much larger problems 
  confronting the entire educational system. One legacy of our frontier past is 
  that the US education scene consists of many fiercely independent empires. Fifty 
  states have different rules and requirements; and there are 16,000 school districts 
  in the country, in many of which local school boards maintain their own priorities 
  and regulations with a grim determination. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This means that 
  innovation and improvement in one place often has little chance of spreading. 
  Even on the national level, there is little push for consistent, progressive 
  change. And - as can be seen from the abysmally bland and ineffective K-12 textbooks 
  - the system strongly favors the lowest common denominator. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Our Society expects 
  our schools to do much more than merely teach our students basic liberal knowledge. 
  Today, we expect our schools to fulfil many of the functions that were the province 
  of the extended family, of religious institutions, and of the community at large 
  just a few decades ago. As Peter Schrag wrote recently in The New Republic, 
  (Dec. 16, 1991, p. 20): "No country has ever done, or even tried, what this 
  country is now trying: To take such a diverse population of children -- 20% 
  of them from below the poverty level, many of them speaking little English, 
  many from one parent or no-parent families -- and educate each child at least 
  through the 12th grade... [Now add to this] what we've learned about the school's 
  external problems -- poverty, broken families, teenage pregnancies, drugs, lack 
  of health care, lack of child care..." </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 1990, Bruce 
  Alberts, now the head of the National Academy, wrote poignantly about high school 
  science teachers in California: Such a teacher might typically teach five classes 
  a day, with three different preparations with a total of more than 160 students. 
  A dedicated teacher, with labs, setup, preparation, grading, student conferences, 
  and all the paperwork schools require, will work something like 70 hours a week, 
  and have an average starting salary of $22,500 per year. Who would want this 
  job? Or who, once having this job, would not be tempted to cut corners, give 
  lots of rote assignments, skimp on hands-on lab experience, and just try to 
  survive? ["Agenda for Excellence" in the Journal of NIH Research, Apr. 1990, 
  p. 19.] </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> During the school 
  year 1993-94, (at the same time that the starting salary for teachers was $22,500 
  on average) the average overall teachers' salary in the U.S. was $35,958 [NEA: 
  Estimates of School Statistics (1994).] If we really felt that education is 
  important in the U.S., would we pay teachers so much less compared to lawyers, 
  accountants, business leaders? Why, in a culture that glorifies money, are we 
  surprised when students (especially students from low-income families) get the 
  message early on -- teaching and learning must not be so important to adults, 
  or film stars and basketball players would not earn outrageously more than a 
  mentor teacher. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> And, despite 
  our expectations of them, schools in our country cannot by themselves solve 
  all the problems that threaten the education of young people. If we really want 
  to make changes in the ways our children are educated, we must be prepared to 
  examine the other influences on their lives as well. For some children, these 
  include poverty, violence, drugs, neglect, ill health, and lack of proper housing. 
  But even for children growing up in economically and emotionally stable environments, 
  there is a pernicious influence that was much discussed as a problem when I 
  was growing up, but today seems to be treated mainly with resignation  television 
  . </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A typical student 
  in the US spends about 900 hours a year in school and between 1200 and 1800 
  hours in front of a television set. In 1993, the average US household had a 
  television set on for about 8 hours per day. And what does a youngster learn 
  from commercial television? More often than not, they gather the exact opposite 
  of what we try to teach them in school:<br>
  </font></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
  <li> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That the only 
    thing that matters is the instant gratification of every urge ("just do it," 
    as the popular slogan says). </font> 
  <li> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That what counts 
    in America is money, celebrity, and fun. </font> 
  <li> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That anything 
    can be true and can happen (and that anecdotal evidence is enough to prove 
    any assertion.) </font> 
</ul>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Think of how 
  teachers are shown on most television programs on the commercial services: mostly 
  as objects of derision. And how are scientists usually portrayed (when they 
  are shown at all)? Mostly as evil villains, or naive agents of serious catastrophe 
  that result from their experiments getting out of control. These "lessons" of 
  television viewing are rarely lost on our students! </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Before leaving 
  the disquieting arena of K-12 education, let me turn just briefly to the places 
  where so many of our teachers are trained - our schools of education. In the 
  20th century, the US has evolved a whole slew of specialized schools and departments 
  for preparing our teachers. In many of these programs, you do not need to take 
  any science (and certainly any physical science) to become an elementary level 
  teacher. It is one of the few majors that do not have such a requirement, which 
  means it actually selects out those people who are afraid of science. This is 
  one reason why so many elementary teachers transmit a fear, a hostility, a shudder 
  at the very mention of science to their young students, at just the time when 
  kids' minds are seeking not just information but values. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Estimates are 
  that more than 2/3 of math and science teachers in the US today do not meet 
  the recommended proficiency standards of their own professional associations 
  (Beardsley, T. "Teaching Real Science" in Scientific American, Oct. 1992, p. 
  98.) But, especially in the higher grades, the problem is not that teachers 
  do not know enough science. The problem is more often that the schools of education, 
  despite their many courses on teaching technique, rarely prepare teachers to 
  present science the way it should be taught -- in ways the students, at their 
  own stages of reasoning, are ready to understand. So science teachers often 
  model their teaching of science on how they learned science, in big college 
  lecture courses, from textbooks full of facts to be memorized. No wonder 11-year 
  olds get turned off when science is presented to them in this way! </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Now some schools 
  of education in this country do make a valuable effort to train teachers in 
  the value of science and its most effective presentation. But as long as schools 
  of education remain separate "fiefdoms" from the departments of science at our 
  universities, and as long as these programs continue to allow teachers to graduate 
  without proper grounding in the method and teaching of science, our children 
  will continue to have role models whose own attitudes toward science would be 
  charitably described as luke-warm. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 1983 the National 
  Commission on Excellence in Education published A Nation at Risk, a report that 
  decried state of education in the U.S. It called the "rising tide of mediocrity" 
  a "peril to our very future as a nation and a people." It compared what was 
  happening in our schools to an act of war, except it was an act we had declared 
  on ourselves. The report (and others like it) made many recommendations, but 
  so far there have been few effective follow-ups and few additional resources 
  for waging this hidden war. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> No amount of 
  teacher training in science will address the fundamental problems of low pay, 
  low morale, and student overwhelmed by life that confronts teachers in so many 
  schools. We as a country must confront those issues, and yet I am very pessimistic 
  about the will or the ability of our elected leaders to do so. This is why many 
  leaders in both science and education are now saying that the hope of the future 
  is for scientists (and other educated citizens) to get personally involved in 
  local and national efforts to reform science education. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In astronomy, 
  such efforts include the A.S.P.'s <a href="../astro/project_astro.html">Project 
  ASTRO</a>, and its "Universe in the Classroom" program with workshops and materials 
  for teachers in grades 3-12; the A.A.S.' A-ASTRA project training mentor teachers 
  in astronomy around the country; several innovative programs in the Education 
  Division at the Center for Astrophysics, led by Phil Sadler; and others listed 
  in my Catalog of National Education Projects. But far more remains to be done 
  and there are not enough astronomers in the country to have much of an effect 
  on their own. Only by joining with other scientific disciplines, and encouraging 
  some meaningful changes in the cultures of our universities, colleges, and research 
  institutions, could we even hope to make any headway in this area.</font></p>

  Informal Education Institutions </b></font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Much of the learning 
  of astronomy in this country is done outside the formal classroom, in institutions 
  and through organizations that sometimes interact with the schools (through 
  class visits, for example) and sometimes act independently. These include planetaria, 
  science museums, observatory visitor centers, NASA facilities, youth groups, 
  and many similar organizations. I can examine each category only briefly here, 
  and want to comment mainly on the organizational strengths that they bring to 
  the task of astronomy education. </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#6666CC"><b><a name="6a"></a>A. 
  Planetaria </b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There are approximately 
  1,100 planetaria in North America, visited by millions of people each year.) 
  About 30% of these serve school groups only, while about 60% do both school 
  and public shows. For many youngsters, a planetarium visit is their first (and 
  in some cases only) introduction to astronomy. The quality of this introduction 
  can vary widely, depending on the skill and background of the presenter and 
  how the planetarium environment is used. Nevertheless, most children have a 
  fond recollection of their planetarium experience, and for many children in 
  cities, it may be the only time they really experience a dark night sky. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Planetarium educators 
  are organized into a number of regional organizations, and into the International 
  Planetarium Society (although not everyone belongs to these groups.) My main 
  observation of the field is that planetarium educators tend to be somewhat isolated 
  from the astronomy research and even college education community; this can occasionally 
  lead to some problems in keeping up with current science, but I don't think 
  these are a major cause for concern. More important is a sense that planetarium 
  educators get of being peripheral to astronomy, despite the large numbers of 
  people for whom they serve as primary contact with the world of astronomy. I 
  think it would be very useful for the main astronomical societies to make more 
  of an effort to involve and get involved with the planetarium enterprise; the 
  AAS has recently taken some first steps in this direction. </font></p>

  Museums </b></font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Many science museums 
  have astronomy exhibits, where visitors can read or participate in activities 
  relating to astronomy or at least space exploration. Many museums also sponsor 
  youth and education programs after school or on weekends. As in planetaria, 
  there are many museum visitors who are first exposed to modern astronomy through 
  such programs. Science museum educators also have an organization, called the 
  Association of Science and Technology Centers (ASTC), with offices in Washington. 
  The same comments I made above for planetaria would apply to astronomy staff 
  at many science museums as well. And astronomers and astronomy research institutions 
  could interact profitably with a local science museum from time to time. The 
  museum could gain access to recent results, images, and surplus equipment, while 
  the astronomy institutions could gain local exposure and be able to demonstrate 
  their commitment to public education to funding agencies. </font></p>

  Observatory Visitor Centers </font></b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A number of the 
  major observatories are expanding or introducing visitors centers at their sites, 
  many of which have an educational as well as a tourist component. Some of these 
  centers accommodate a large number of visitors; for example, the National Optical 
  Astronomy Observatory center on Kitt Peak has some 100,000 visitors per year. 
  An especially good center has been built at the Lowell Observatory, where you 
  can experience a computer simulation of a night at the observatory. A new center 
  has been put in at Arecibo in Puerto Rico, with bilingual educational programs. 
  Of course, there are budget problems that prevent much expansion in this area, 
  but my feeling is that more cooperation among observatories and more communication 
  among those of us working in astronomy education would have a salutary effect 
  on these efforts. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Another aspect 
  of the work of observatories is responding to requests for information from 
  the public. Some observatories have developed excellent materials of their own, 
  others use the materials developed by such groups as the Astronomical Society 
  of the Pacific, NASA, NOAO, and Sky & Telescope magazine. It would be helpful 
  to have a national database of available resources for those whose responsibility 
  is responding to public inquiries. </font></p>

  NASA Centers and Divisions </font></b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> NASA has extensive 
  efforts to help in science education, on many fronts, but the agency is so large, 
  and has so many centers and divisions that the education situation is complicated. 
  My impression is that even NASA people don't know what all the different branches, 
  missions, and centers are doing, and there still much less coordination among 
  the many different programs than an outside observer might expect. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> NASA's Education 
  Division produces a lot of educational materials, mostly about space flight, 
  but some about astronomy and space science. But because of government regulations 
  that prevent the government from competing with private industry, NASA distributes 
  these materials according to rules that can only be described as quantum mechanical. 
  If you happen to be at the right place at the right time, you can get it free; 
  if not, you probably can't even learn the material exists. No database exists 
  of these materials (at least as far as I can find) and no one seems to be responsible 
  for keeping the best ones in print or updated. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> NASA supports 
  a wide-spread network of K-12 teacher resource centers in a variety of locations 
  around the country (the centers are of varying size, quality, and effectiveness). 
  The best of them are at the NASA Centers themselves and can be important sources 
  of information and visuals for teachers about NASA programs for educators. There 
  is also a national network of Space Grant Colleges and Universities whose educational 
  programs also can vary all over the map in approach and effectiveness. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In part out of 
  frustration with the Education Division, and in part in response to Congressional 
  pressure and its own interest in education, the NASA's Office of Space Science 
  (OSS) has in recent years already undertaken an independent series of initiatives 
  in education, which include giving several million to the Space Telescope Science 
  Institute for public outreach and instituting a series of small grants for educational 
  projects called the IDEA grant program. These smaller IDEA grants have been 
  awarded to a number of astronomy and space science institutions over the last 
  few years, but there has been little evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
  grants or widespread dissemination of the resulting materials. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Recently, as 
  we have pointed out, NASA has begun requiring that all new missions have a built-in 
  education component, and it will be interesting to see whether and how the resulting 
  infusion of funds will change the way space science education is done in this 
  country. The concern that some of us have is that many NASA projects are simply 
  striking off on their own, and not coordinating, and often can spend their resources 
  creating materials for which the demand exists mostly in the imagination of 
  the scientists, not in the real classrooms of this country. (How much demand 
  is there really for information on anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background 
  at the 4th grade level?) </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But now, a very 
  welcome program which involves both coordination and leveraging of OSS educational 
  resources is being put in place under the directorship of Dr. Jeff Rosendhal. 
  Two reports, Partners in Education: A Strategy for Integrating Education and 
  Public Outreach into NASA's Space Science Programs (Mar. 1995) and Implementing 
  the Office of Space Science Education/Public Outreach Strategy (Oct. 1996) have 
  been issued and are well worth reading for their analysis of the situation and 
  novel proposals. OSS has just established a network of educational forums and 
  brokers/facilitators around the country - institutions which will work to coordinate 
  and leverage the work and materials that individuals or groups produce in astronomy 
  and space science education to make sure they reach the widest audiences. It 
  will be very interesting to see how these NASA initiatives will play out in 
  the years to come. In the past, NASA has often played the "Lone Ranger" in science 
  education - proceeding as if no one else existed in this field. The new era 
  of cooperation and coordination that seems on the horizon may mean that everyone 
  - NASA and the rest of us - will benefit from the sharing of resources and ideas.

<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In response to 
  some of the crises in K-12 education that I discussed above, a number of interesting 
  grass-roots efforts are springing up to supplement science in the schools with 
  after-school and summer activities, sometimes in connection with a local science 
  center, youth group, or community organization. At the present time, there is 
  unfortunately no central clearing house that would keep track of and disseminate 
  the results of such efforts or coordinate their activities. </font></p>

  Amateur Astronomers </b></font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The U.S. has a 
  large population of amateur astronomers, people whose hobby is astronomical 
  observing or following astronomical developments in a serious sort of way. I 
  like to divide the amateur community into three categories: Research-level amateurs 
  are those who have sophisticated telescopes and detectors, or who carry out 
  serious observing programs. These amateurs are usually members of such specialized 
  organizations as the American Association of Variable Star Observers, Association 
  of Lunar and Planetary Observers, or the International Amateur-Professional 
  Photoelectric Photometry Group, or they are working in conjunction with a professional 
  astronomer in their community. There are probably not more than a few hundred 
  of this group in our country. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Observing amateurs 
  are those who have a telescope and regularly take it out for observing the sky, 
  either for their own amusement or with a community or school group. These amateurs 
  are frequently members of some of the more than 200 amateur clubs in the U.S., 
  many of which are, in turn, members of the umbrella organization called the 
  Astronomical League. The League currently has a combined membership of almost 
  13,000 people. Armchair amateurs, on the other hand, are those who mainly prefer 
  to read about astronomy and may or may not do some casual observing from time 
  to time. Some of these amateurs are members of local clubs, but many are not, 
  and pursue their interest in astronomy through magazines or books they read, 
  programs they watch on television, and lecture series they may attend. Some 
  are members of such national organizations as the Astronomical Society of the 
  Pacific or the Planetary Society. New converts to this group these days can 
  come from those browsing the many interesting astronomy rest-stops on the information 
  superhighway. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Many members 
  of the three groups are tied together by the two main magazines for amateurs, 
  Sky & Telescope and Astronomy. Astronomy had a circulation in 1996 of 170,000, 
  while S&T was at 110,000. Estimates of the total number of amateurs in the U.S. 
  range from 200,000 to 500,000, often depending on how exactly you define the 
  term. In any case, this figure, 40 to 100 times the number of professional astronomers, 
  represents a tremendous population with potential in astronomy education. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Many amateurs 
  are already involved in education, by going for occasional visits to local schools 
  or putting on neighborhood star parties, where youngsters get their first look 
  through a telescope. The amateur community organizes a National Astronomy Day 
  each spring, where they make a special effort to bring telescopes to where people 
  are and show them the night sky. The Astronomical League has a number of educational 
  programs and publications, although they are limited by being purely volunteer 
  efforts with no budget to support them. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But much more 
  could be done. Many amateurs have time, knowledge, energy, and enthusiasm, which 
  could much more actively be harnessed in the service of education. Some professional 
  astronomers and educators worry that amateurs will tell students erroneous things; 
  but at the level of a 5th grade class, the physics of quasar energy mechanisms 
  isn't really a relevant topic. The phases of the Moon, why telescopes are needed 
  to observe celestial objects, or the joys of hunting comets are much more appropriate 
  to the reasoning level of the youngsters. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This was the 
  thought behind Project ASTRO, a pilot program in the early 1990's at the Astronomical 
  Society of the Pacific (supported by the National Science Foundation and NASA): 
  to set up ongoing partnerships between amateur (and professional) astronomers 
  and 4th to 9th grade teachers in sites around California. After a training workshop 
  for the partners, astronomers visited "their" classroom not once, but at least 
  four times (some went as many as 10 times), and worked with the teacher to present 
  age-appropriate hands-on classroom and after-school activities. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> We found that, 
  with proper training, and when they are provided with a suite of good activities 
  and teaching resources, amateurs (and professionals) can do an excellent job 
  in helping students get excited about astronomy and science in general. Project 
  ASTRO has produced The Universe at Your Fingertips, an 815-page loose-leaf notebook 
  of exemplary activities, resource lists, and teaching suggestions that incorporate 
  the best ideas from our project and many others around the country, which is 
  now in its second printing and is being used by thousands of scientists and 
  educators around the world. A How-to Manual for Astronomer-Educator Partnerships 
  and a short video are also available through the project. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The pilot program 
  was so successful that NSF has funded the expansion of the program to nine sites 
  around the country, from Boston to Seattle. The Clark Foundation is supporting 
  a tenth site in Salt Lake City. The program also offers training workshops for 
  interested partners at meetings attended by either professional or amateur astronomers. 
  Given the limited number of professional astronomers in the country, however, 
  any expansion of the program will clearly depend on the active involvement of 
  the amateur community. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In some ways, 
  the interpreters to the public are the most far-reaching part of the astronomy 
  education community, because they include the media. It is sobering to remember 
  that one episode of "Unsolved Mysteries" on television is seen by far more people 
  than all the students any of us will ever teach during our entire careers. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The astronomy 
  interpretation community includes editors and reporters at daily newspapers 
  and magazines, producers and writers on radio & television, the authors of introductory 
  books on astronomical topics, the writers of children's books, and the authors 
  of astronomy software and Web-sites. Let's look at this world briefly: </font></p>

  Magazines </font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  </font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If you examine 
  a list of the top 100 magazines by circulation, you do find some rays of hope 
  amidst the gathering darkness of gossip and entertainment magazines. In 1994, 
  there was one in the top 5 U.S. magazines that regularly features very high 
  quality astronomy articles: can you guess which magazine that is? It's National 
  Geographic (with a circulation of about 9.5 million). </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In the top 20, 
  we have Time and Newsweek, both of which have had excellent physical science 
  reporting, although both are now tending toward shorter and more superficial 
  articles. The top 30 includes Smithsonian and the top 40, Popular Science. And 
  one of the largest circulation periodicals in the country, the Sunday newspaper 
  supplement called Parade (which is mostly pap), regularly featured wonderful 
  essays by the late Carl Sagan which extolled the scientific perspective and 
  debunk popular pseudo-sciences. David Levy (the comet hunter) has now been hired 
  to continue this series. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In the category 
  of smaller circulation special interest magazines, we have a number that do 
  an excellent job of reporting astronomy to their readers: In addition to Sky 
  & Telescope and Astronomy (which we have already mentioned), there are Discover, 
  Scientific American, American Scientist, and Air and Space. Excellent and regular 
  coverage also appears in the news pages of such magazines as Science, Nature, 
  or Science News. Plus many of the astronomical and space interest societies 
  issue their own magazines, such as The Planetary Report from the Planetary Society, 
  Mercury from the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, or Ad Astra from the National 
  Space Society. Here, although specialist occasionally complain about a subtle 
  point being missed, the reporting is very, very good indeed, and astronomy stands 
  out among sciences as receiving and offering the best coverage for readers with 
  a serious interest in the field. Of course such readers are relatively small 
  in number compared to the population of the country. </font></p>

  Daily Newspapers (Radio/TV News) </font></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If you follow 
  astronomy reporting in U.S. newspapers, you are probably used to reading the 
  syndicated copy of some of the very best science reporters (from such newspapers 
  as The New York Times, The Boston Globe, or The Los Angeles Times.) But these 
  reporters, many of whom have some training in science, and who generally belong 
  to a trade organization called the National Association of Science Writers, 
  are really the cream of the profession. Under that cream comes a much larger 
  group of reporters, editors, and radio and TV people whose training and judgment 
  have become a cause for national concern. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In the old days, 
  many journalists were trained in some academic subject (or self-trained) and 
  went out to report the news. Today, there are over 400 schools or departments 
  of journalism in the US (although many are slowly changing their names to include 
  words like communication and media Ü in part because many of their graduates 
  hope to earn large salaries reading the news from cue cards on television.) 
  These graduates, armed with courses as unspecific and muddled as anything our 
  schools of education can come up with, are beginning to fill the ranks of the 
  radio, television, and print media in the country. Many have minimal or no training 
  in science and a good fraction share the larger public's distrust of and sense 
  of intimidation by scientists. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Even many of 
  the elite journalists in the first group don't do as much digging and reporting 
  these days as you might imagine. They have a kind of symbiotic relationship 
  with the public information officers at universities, research labs, and scientific 
  societies, whose job it is to get out the news from their institution and have 
  it be as widely disseminated as possible. (The two groups are actually so interwoven 
  that journalists frequently move from one to the other and back again with ease.) 
  Because no reporter can keep up with all that is happening in every science, 
  many have come to rely on public information officers to identify noteworthy 
  stories for them. And those are usually the stories that are then developed. 
  There are exceptions &#151; often stories with a local angle or a whiff of scandal 
  &#151; but many journalists are happy to pluck the fruit from the low hanging 
  branches of the information tree; it is rare to see them do much climbing on 
  their own. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In San Francisco, 
  for example, the majority of non-local astronomy stories the public has gotten 
  to read or hear about in the past two years have been determined by only two 
  processes: 1. what stories Steve Maran, the Public Information Officer of the 
  American Astronomical Society, decides to feature at the society meeting press 
  conferences (which are attended by many top science reporters whose stories 
  are frequently syndicated around the country); and 2. what stories NASA and 
  Space Telescope Science Institute public information officers decide to hold 
  news conferences or issue illustrated news releases about. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When the non-elite 
  group of journalists cover some science story (especially on radio and TV), 
  they often do so reluctantly and frequently make a muddle of it. Or they wind 
  up simply rewriting a press release or wire service copy, or focusing on a local 
  scientist who can comment in 20 seconds on the story. Furthermore, it often 
  turns out that most of what these journalists call science news is actually 
  news about medicine or applied technology. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> It is these second-tier 
  journalists who often get confused (to make the most charitable interpretation) 
  between science and pseudoscience. They were the ones who reacted to the Nancy 
  Reagan astrology revelations by interviewing local astrologers (who made it 
  all sound like the most natural thing in the world that the president's schedule 
  should be determined by astrological forecasting) and by doing puff pieces on 
  all the movie stars that also guided their lives by astrology. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But there is 
  another part of modern journalism, which more rarely gets discussed: the gatekeepers 
  of the media. Decisions about what gets on the evening news are usually not 
  made by the people you watch on your screen. Decisions about what gets significant 
  coverage in the newspapers are not made by the people whose bylines you know. 
  Decisions about what topics are discussed on the radio are often not made by 
  the people whose voices you hear. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Making these 
  decision is the role of the gate-keepers, editors and producers who filter the 
  news, select the stories to be covered, and direct the tone of the material 
  that will be read on the air. These gate-keepers are often young, superficially 
  educated, and lack any serious knowledge of science. Yet they are the ones who 
  assign the stories to reporters, determine the length of articles or broadcast 
  pieces, and decide where these pieces will appear. They have been, many of them, 
  raised on a steady diet of the kind of journalism we now have, and so accept 
  the current system without question. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Furthermore, 
  it is this group, more than the reporters, that is actually charged with minding 
  the corporate bottom line at their institutions, and is thus most likely to 
  pander to the worst instincts of the public instead of educating them. (Just 
  count the number of news stories about ghosts around Halloween or the predictions 
  of psychics around the new year.) Their sense of the public trust of journalism 
  is founded much more on an entertainment than an educational model, and the 
  trends in what gets reported and how it gets reported clearly bear out their 
  influence. Small wonder that serious science and skeptical inquiry, which is 
  the best thing the scientific method has to teach us, get such short shrift.

  Radio and Television Programming </font></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Now we get further 
  into the media wasteland, where oases are harder to find. Scientists tend to 
  focus on and hear about these oases, such as the Stardate and Earth & Sky radio 
  programs, the NOVA television series on PBS, the new telecourse on astronomy 
  from Coast Community College, an occasional special somewhere on a cable channel, 
  etc. The most successful astronomy TV program was Cosmos, estimated to have 
  been seen by 500 million people in more than 60 countries since 1980. But all 
  these are merely exceptions to the general rule of what is seen on television 
  on an average night. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Overall, the 
  television picture is very dim indeed, with vast quantities of pseudo-science 
  being served up by most of the commercial networks. (This is being exacerbated 
  by the tremendous growth of what is called "tabloid tv" &#151; shows that generally 
  imitate the contents and approach of the tabloid newspapers.) Science on many 
  stations is often limited to ten-second newsbites on the evening news that make 
  little sense to the uninitiated (and are often "Guinness Book of World Records" 
  stories &#151; the farthest galaxy, or the most massive black hole.) </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As a country, 
  we need to recognize the enormous power that the media have, and pay more attention 
  to how decisions are made in the media. By this I don't mean censorship, but 
  rather undertaking a long-term educational program to make sure that those who 
  have the responsibility for deciding what goes on the air (or what is printed) 
  have the education and the informed background to make sensible judgments. One 
  step would be to introduce and require excellent science overview courses developed 
  specifically for students going into journalism. Another would be for everyone 
  who is dissatisfied with science coverage on the media to make his or her voice 
  heard locally or nationally. (In San Francisco, the work we have done at the 
  ASP has increased the amount of astronomy on local radio and television significantly 
  and, although it took a while, it was not a very painful exercise.) </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The argument 
  the media always make in response to such concerns is that they are merely giving 
  the public what it wants. But this argument is specious. Someone like me, who 
  began life in Communist Eastern Europe, never got to taste a mango or an avocado 
  as a child. Thus I would never have known to ask for a mango or an avocado, 
  or have realized that I might want one. But after we came to America, I was 
  introduced to a much wider range of foods: my palate was educated...and now 
  I ask for mango and avocado regularly. Similarly, I would suggest that when 
  the media tell us that people are much more interested in the Bermuda triangle 
  that the Great Attractor, they are merely confessing our joint failure at educating 
  both the gatekeepers of the media and the public about the tasty treats real 
  science has to offer. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In focusing so 
  strongly on the entertainment aspect of their mission over the educational aspect, 
  the media lose sight of the fact that there is an alternative to pandering to 
  the lowest taste. It is the far more difficult and long term job (and the almost 
  forgotten pleasure) of elevating the tastes and desires of their audience to 
  new levels of perception and understanding. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I should mention 
  that there is a national organization which is making a creditable effort to 
  help the media sort out science from fiction science. The group is called the 
  Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), 
  a mouthful of a name, but a group with their hearts in the right place. It consists 
  of scientists, educators, magicians, philosophers, lawyers, and other skeptics 
  whose interest is to get the rational, skeptical perspective about fiction science 
  out to the media and the public. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Through their 
  superb magazine, The Skeptical Inquirer, their meetings and workshops, and their 
  information releases to the media, CSICOP has managed to alert and educate a 
  significant number of reporters to stop and consider what they are doing when 
  they file a story involving pseudoscience. They also work to bring together 
  such reporters with skeptical spokespeople before a story is written. (They 
  can be contacted at: P.O. Box 703, Amherst, NY 14226; I urge everyone in astronomy 
  education to get to know their work and support what they are doing.) </font></p>

  Nontechnical Books for Adults </font></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 1993, roughly 
  45,000 new books were published in the U.S. [Publishers Weekly, Mar. 7, 1994, 
  data from R.R. Bowker Co.] Of these, about 2,000 were classified as science, 
  although I suspect that the librarians who do this classifying may well include 
  some pseudoscience in this category. Such books, written by both scientists 
  and science journalists, can be an important way that educated laypeople learn 
  about new developments and ideas in science. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> When a really 
  excellent book comes along, such as Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos or First Light, 
  it can give laypeople marvelous insight into how astronomy is really done today. 
  A best seller, such as Cosmos or The Brief History of Time (which by the end 
  of 1993 had sold over 5.5 million copies worldwide), can turn many people on 
  to astronomy, although such initial enthusiasm generally needs more to sustain 
  it than a single book can provide. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> On this front, 
  there is good news and bad news: the good news is that fine books in popular 
  astronomy are still finding a publisher; the bad news is that these publishers 
  rarely promote or advertise such books with any energy or enthusiasm. Instead, 
  they reserve their advertising budgets for the books they consider "guaranteed 
  big sellers", a phrase which then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. As a result, 
  some of the best astronomy books of the last decade have sunk without a trace 
  in the vast murky ocean of modern publishing. The recent trend of mergers among 
  publishers and book stores, and the resulting reduction in the variety of books 
  being effectively marketed, will only serve to make this situation worse, I 
  suspect. </font></p>

  Children's books </font></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> One area of astronomy 
  education that has received very little attention are children's books, despite 
  the fact that these can have a strong influence on youngsters. Several astronomers 
  and science writers have produced whole series of astronomy books for kids, 
  among them the late biochemist Isaac Asimov, the former director of the Hayden 
  Planetarium Franklyn Branley, British astrophysicist David Darling, the current 
  director of the Griffith Observatory Ed Krupp, the associate director of the 
  Pacific Science Center Dennis Schatz, journalist Seymour Simon, and NASA aerospace 
  specialist Gregory Vogt. Alas, mixed in with these excellent and reliable books 
   often on specific single topics in astronomy  are a host of muddle-headed, 
  error-filled books written by people with little science background and published 
  by organizations and publishers who should (in many cases) know better. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> At the ASP, we 
  have collected and reviewed hundreds of children's books on astronomy and have 
  published recommendations for the best of them in The Universe at Your Fingertips 
  Resource Notebook. But it would be nice if there were more of a concerted effort 
  to review and recognize children's books that do a good job in teaching astronomy.

  The World Wide Web </font></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Here truly is 
  a realm where the good, the bad, and the ugly coexist; no medium is as democratic 
  and thus as "un-refereed" as the web. Some excellent sites for astronomy education 
  coexist with the most pernicious and misleading nonsense. I might point to the 
  fact that in fall 1996, a single mistaken observation by a vociferous observer 
  with no serious background in astronomy, claiming that Comet Hale-Bopp was being 
  followed by a giant object, was then spread via the Web, the Internet, and late 
  night talk radio shows to all corners of the world (and may have played a significant 
  role in the Heaven's Gate suicides). Many of us have probably had to deal with 
  questions from this bizarre incident, and it illustrates that at a time when 
  conspiracy theories are high on the list of public entertainment and paranoia, 
  the unfettered medium of the Web brings dangers as well as opportunities. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There are voices 
  among astronomers and astronomy educators that see the Web as the best solution 
  to the problems I have outlined above, and look forward to the day when all 
  American schools will have Web access. And there is no question that the Web 
  has enormous potential in disseminating images and information to a wide range 
  of end users. Many of us, however, have a number of doubts about Web based solutions 
  and projects. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> First of all, 
  one must take with a cosmic grain of salt the statistics being bandied about 
  indicating how many schools are connected to the Web. More careful surveys (and 
  discussions with teachers) reveal that the fact that the school may have one 
  computer (in the principal's office, say) with a modem and Web connection does 
  not guarantee that the average teacher or student will have access, time, training, 
  and encouragement to use it. In fact, the teachers who make best use of the 
  Web often wind up doing so from their home computers and on their own time. 
  </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> And while there 
  are now some superb sites which encourage and facilitate age-appropriate, hands-on, 
  inquiry-based activities in astronomy, many other sites are designed either 
  with an astronomy graduate student or advanced physics teacher in mind (making 
  very little sense to the average browser) or are put together by an enthusiast 
  with minimal science background and often filled with misunderstandings. Surfing 
  the Web may be a delightful way to spend an afternoon (much like video games, 
  and sometimes with the same hypnotic effect), but there is no guarantee that 
  educational outcomes will follow unless the surfer has careful guidance. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> To be sure, the 
  Web has only been around a short time, and as new tools, new modes of access, 
  and new public attitudes develop around it, its efficacy and outreach capabilities 
  may yet make it one of the most important areas of informal science education. 
  But it might be useful to bear in mind that similar claims (that it would transform 
  education and save the world) were made for television in its early days, and 
  those promises have now given way to serious concerns about the mindlessness 
  of much of television programming.</font></p>

  Conclusion </b></font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In this quick 
  summary, I've focused on the problems and challenges before us, in part because 
  I wanted to give the realistic context for those who set out to make contributions 
  in astronomy education. The task of improving science education and science 
  literacy in this country is a staggering one, and there is no single solution, 
  and no simple shortcut, no inexpensive pathway to getting it done. Without picking 
  on any project in particular, I would just note that anyone who tells you that 
  all the problems in education will be solved if we (for example) teach all 10th 
  graders the joys of computer image processing, doesn't live in the real world, 
  I am afraid. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The good news 
  is that I am not the only one speaking in occasionally despairing tones about 
  the situation. Throughout the country, scientists, engineers, and educators 
  in many fields are becoming concerned about these problems and looking for ways 
  we can change the six cultures I've described and to focus more attention on 
  education within those cultures. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In astronomy 
  these efforts are really just beginning, and those of us involved in educational 
  reform, whichever of the communities that I've discussed we belong to, often 
  feel isolated and overwhelmed. At the present time, there is no effective network 
  tying workers in astronomy education together - no single journal or newsletter, 
  no organization, and no regular meetings. Thus there is little coordination 
  and exchange of information among people - even those with the same job titles. 
  The wheel is being re-invented over and over again, good materials appear and 
  disappear with unpredictable periods. And, in some places, there continues to 
  be strong peer pressure against serious time-consuming involvement in astronomy 
  education. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The standards 
  of work in the field vary tremendously, because people drop in and out of being 
  interested, often as their own budget or time pressures dictate. Unlike research 
  astronomy, where one generally feels pretty ashamed to make a suggestion in 
  a research field unless one has studied the existing literature, in astronomy 
  education anyone feels that he can pontificate, publish, ask for a grant - often 
  without making any effort to acquaint himself with what has already been done. 
  </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Several of us 
  have suggested that either the American Astronomical Society or the Astronomical 
  Society of the Pacific actively create a Division for Astronomy Education (which 
  strongly encourages - by means of lower dues - membership of active workers 
  in all six of these domains), but so far these suggestions have not born much 
  fruit. The AAS has recently recruited a paid Education Coordinator (in addition 
  to its unpaid Education Officer) in the person of Doug Duncan (U. of Chicago), 
  and is looking at how to bring about institutional changes that may encourage 
  its members to do more in astronomy education. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Larry Rudnick 
  tells me that at the University of Minnesota they have abolished the undergraduate 
  education major; each student preparing to be a teacher must major in some other 
  discipline. The University of Arizona has offered a masters degree in astronomy 
  for working school teachers; many of their graduates are already leaders in 
  astronomy or science education. Sonoma State University is offering a bachelors 
  in astronomy for non-scientists: historians of science, journalists, planetarium 
  educators, etc. We need more such liberal arts degrees that still offer rigorous 
  training in science. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> To conclude, 
  I'd like to make the simple suggestion that everyone in astronomy devote a minimum 
  of one percent of his or her time to improving astronomy education for nonscientists: 
  if we take a 40 hour work-week and 52 weeks in a year, one percent works out 
  to 21 hours a year. That's seven three-hour sessions with a local teacher, that's 
  preparing or giving a workshop for all the graduate students and postdocs in 
  an astronomy department about recent developments in education and things they 
  can do to help; that's getting involved with a campus committee to reform graduate 
  requirements for students who are going to be the teachers of tomorrow; that's 
  spending several afternoons with the staff of the local planetarium; that's 
  arranging a meeting of all the local community college instructors of astronomy, 
  etc. etc. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I urge everyone 
  to do this not only out of a sense of duty or compassion. The ominous news from 
  recent developments in our nation's capitol is that the unwritten compact through 
  which the federal government has supported science and universities for the 
  sake of their value to national security shows signs of breaking down. New generations 
  of our leaders (like new generations of our students) do not feel immense loyalty 
  or warmth toward science. And their apathy may well allow very serious cuts 
  in the budgets that support so much of our scientific enterprise. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As Neal Lane 
  (the NSF Director) said at the Jan 1996 AAS Meeting; " If you don't take it 
  as one of your professional responsibilities to inform your fellow citizens 
  about the importance of the science and technology enterprise, then [it may 
  well turn out] that public support - critical to sustaining it - [one day] isn't 
  going to be there!" </font></p>
<p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Our crisis in 
  the public understanding of science is like a disease that has slowly attacked 
  our country over the years. If it is allowed to fester untreated for much longer, 
  the body politic will surely send its own antibodies to the source of irritation, 
  and the resulting "cure" may be worse than anything scientists can now imagine. 
  Thus the work we do today in science education may well turn out to be the single 
  most important thing that can be done to assure the continued good health of 
  the science of astronomy in the United States. </font></p>
