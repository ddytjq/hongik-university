<p>
The infrared emission from galaxies comes primarily from three sources:
stars, interstellar gas, and dust.  The emission from stars peaks in the
near infrared (1-3 microns).
Emission from atoms and molecules in interstellar
gas makes up only a few percent of the infrared output of galaxies.
The primary source of infrared radiation beyond 3 microns is thermal emission
from dust grains heated by starlight.

<p>
The brightest infrared galaxies are
usually the ones which have a lot of dust (from star-forming regions
for example).
Astronomers using the IRAS satellite observed 20,000 galaxies in the infrared.
Many of these were starburst galaxies -  galaxies which are
forming enormous numbers of new stars and are thus extremely bright in the
infrared.  Further infrared studies of these galaxies may find
the cause of this star-forming frenzy.  At the left is a 2MASS infrared image of a starburst
galaxy. 
<p>
Elliptical galaxies are faint in the infrared because they no longer
have much gas and dust.
Spiral galaxies which are rich in gas and dust are strong infrared sources
and are still forming new stars.  About half of the luminosity of an average
spiral galaxy is radiated at far infrared wavelengths.
Below are the infrared images of three galaxies:  An ISO image of M83 ("journal des astronomes francais"; Jun 1996), a 2MASS image of M104 and a 2MASS image of
M51.

Sometimes galaxies, each containing billions of stars, collide with each
other.  These collisions trigger star formation in these galaxies by
causing the compression of clouds of gas and dust to the point where they
collapse due to their own gravity.  Due to a high rate of star formation,
colliding gas-rich galaxies radiate very strongly in the infrared.
The <a href="http://isowww.estec.esa.nl/activities/info/iso_pr96.html">
ISO satellite observed several 
colliding galaxies</a> in the infrared and detected many areas of intense star
formation within them.  Below are two 2MASS images showing galaxies colliding.

During December 1995, the Hubble Space Telescope scanned a small area of the
sky to make the deepest image of the sky ever - this area is called the
Hubble Deep Field.
In 1996, Astronomers using ISO found that many of the faint galaxies
detected by the Hubble Space Telescope in the Hubble Deep Field radiate most
of their energy in the infrared and are going through a period of very
active star formation.
Recently, <a href="http://spider.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/jarrett/2mass/3chan/gplane/veil.html">several new galaxies were discovered behind the 
Milky Way</a> in near-infrared 
<a href="http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/">2MASS</a> images.
