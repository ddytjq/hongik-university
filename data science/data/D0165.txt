        - Offers viewers the option to purchase items they see in television programs. 
        This offers an alternative to purchasing items over the Internet, catalog 
        shopping, and even to the traditional television shopping network. Viewers 
        are able to purchase merchandise while watching a television program that 
        already targets their interests. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For example, 
        if a viewer is watching the popular sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; and they 
        admire the sweater Ross is wearing, they could click on the &quot;shopping 
        mode&quot; icon and see how much the sweater costs, which store it is 
        sold at, and purchase it at that very moment. Likewise, if a sports fanatic 
        is watching the Golf Channel, they could possibly buy the golf clubs that 
        Tiger Woods uses in his US PGA Tournament if they choose to watch television 
        in &quot;shopping mode&quot;.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This application 
        drives impulse buying (see stats needed on Home Shopping Network below).<br>
        <br>
        <b>Advertisers</b> -This application offers advertisers a powerful tool 
        since viewers actually choose to view advertising. For example, a person 
        watching a television program and clicks on the &quot;shopping mode&quot; 
        button would actually want to be exposed to the advertised merchandise 
        and branding material. It is very easy for advertisers to see more direct 
        results. Advertising can be extremely targeted to each television program 
        as advertisers typically know the details of the target audience of each 
        television program. When they find the appropriate target audience, they 
        typically purchase a 20 second commercial spot. They can't guarantee that 
        their audience isn't getting up from the television on commercial break. 
        The Interactive Shopping Services, allows viewers to request to view their 
        information and perhaps make an impulse buy while watching the show. The 
        reaction time from advertisement to point of sale is almost real-time.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Service Providers</b> - This is a favorable application to service 
        providers. First of all, this application doesn't take the viewer away 
        from the television, which is important criteria to service providers. 
        Second, it offers great revenue potential since the service provider could 
        charge a minimal administration fee (1% or 2%) to the merchant for each 
        order placed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This application 
        would be easy for service providers to implement, which makes this a very 
        attractive application to service providers. The effort required on their 
        end to put this type of application together is as simple as using authoring 
        tools for a web page. It is low cost to maintain, making this application 
        very appealing to them. <br>

        <br>
        This function allows viewers the ability to enter into &quot;shopping 
        mode&quot;, while watching their favorite television programs. Once a 
        viewer is in shopping mode, they are exposed to any merchandise for sale 
        throughout the duration of the television program. <br>
        <br>
        The service provider would add several xlets to the carousel at the beginning 
        of the television program to encourage people to click on the &quot;shopping 
        mode&quot; icon. After x number of minutes, the service provider would 
        take several of the xlets off the carousel to replace data spots with 
        product information (pricing, description, image, branding, etc). The 
        xlet would continue to be on the carousel in order to encourage new viewers 
        throughout the program to click on &quot;shopping mode&quot;. <br>
        <br>
        <i><b>View Information about Merchandise for Sale</b></i><br>
        <br>
        This function allows viewers to access all relevant information in order 
        to make an educated purchasing decision. Information such as product description, 
        product pricing, branding information, and an image would be of interest 
        to the viewer. <br>
        <br>
        During the program, the xlet reads the sequence script and retrieves information 
        from the carousel in time to display the notification that an item is 
        available for sale. At that time, the xlet should have already read the 
        data needed to display the proper content if the viewer is to click on 
        the &quot;more&quot; button (pricing information, image, product description, 
        branding information, etc). It is mandatory for the xlet to have read 
        all data needed before displaying a notification.<br>
        <br>
        When building this application, the sequence of items shown, must be in 
        context with the television programming. For instance, don't show pots 
        unless you are in a kitchen scene in the television program. <br>
        <br>
        The data should be delivered to the viewer seamlessly. If the xlet misses 
        a piece of merchandise on the carousel, the xlet should not give any indication 
        to the viewer that an item has been missed. <br>
        <br>
        An example script could include the following:<br>
        <br>
        1:00, add kettle, ID#412356, show image, show price, show description<br>
        5:35, add sweater, ID#415262, show image, show price, show description<br>
        10:00, remove all <br>
        16:20, add pots, ID#526142, show image, show price, show description</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Need data 
        for each piece of the script, which could include product description, 
        pricing, image, branding information, etc. <br>
        <br>
        There must be some indication to the viewer when a new item of merchandise 
        is added to the carousel to be viewed. <br>
        <br>
        It is also important to note that you do not want to interrupt the viewers 
        experience too much throughout the television program. Perhaps there would 
        only be five pieces of merchandise showcased throughout the duration of 
        a 30-minute television program. The viewer will not have control over 
        the items available for sale. This will be handled through the advertisers, 
        service providers, and content providers. <br>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The xlet 
        would tell the set-top box to add the product ID# to smart card. When 
        the set-top box uses its modem at midnight to connect to the service provider, 
        it would say &quot;bill me for X items purchased&quot;, with the associated

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Additional 
        Functionality Note</b>: Security measures are needed for this application 
        in order to control children and other people in the household from making 
        unapproved purchases. The final stages of the purchasing process should 
        include the viewer typing in a password. The password protection procedure 
        will need to be handled by another application, since it wouldn't be appropriate 
        for the Interactive Shopping Services application to have access to the 
        viewers' password.</font></p>

        and shipping fees. You click on the &quot;Gift&quot; icon, which allows 
        you to type in the address of your father. You click on &quot;buy now&quot; 
        again you are once again exposed to the total price since it changed due 
        to the your father's address (delivery fee). You must click on &quot;buy 
        now&quot; one last time, which is completed upon typing in your password. 
        A week later, your father phones to thank you for the great fishing rod 
        for Father's Day. <br>

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This application 
          idea actually values reruns. New items can be available in reruns, including 
          collector items. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another 
          variation of this application is to target it specific to commercials. 
          While viewers watch traditional 20-second commercial spots, there could 
          be an option to click on &quot;buy now&quot; and purchase the advertised 
          product.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Not all 
          products in each television program are for sale. This is determined 
          by the service providers and content providers before the show goes 
          on air. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is 
          important to note that you should not put too much content on the screen 
          because you do not want viewers to be too distracted while watching 
          their favorite television programs. An image, brief description, pricing 
          information, branding information, and a &quot;Buy Now&quot; button 
          should be all that is needed<br>
