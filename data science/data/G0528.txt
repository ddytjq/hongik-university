            the early 1960's quasars were known as 'radio stars' because the method 
            used to discover the first quasars was based on coincidences between 
            a strong radio source and a point-like optical source. Since each 
            radio source was associated with a star it was originally thought 
            that quasars were objects within the galaxy hence the term 'radio 
            stars'.</font></font> 
            <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quasars 
              or quasi-stellar radio source, from the method by which they where 
              originally discovered : as stellar optical counterparts to small 
              regions of strong radio emission. With increasing spatial resolution 
              of radio telescopes the strong radio emission often seemed to come 
              from a pair of lobes surrounding many of these faint star-like emission 
              line objects.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
              method initial method of selection was strong radio emission, then 
              later any object with blue or ultraviolet excess was considered 
              a good quasar candidate. Very recent evidence from the near infrared 
              portion of the spectrum indicates that a large fraction of quasars 
              may in fact be brighter in the infrared than in other wavelength 
              bands.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, 
              due to an error in spectral identification made by Maarten S</font><font size="2"><img src="Schmidt.gif"
        alt="Maarten Schmidt" align="left" hspace="0" width="90"
        height="109"><font face="Arial,Helvetica">chmidt (1963) these quasars 
              were incorrectly classified as extra-galactic objects. In order 
              to distance themselves from the term 'radio stars' they nicknamed 
              these objects QUASARs for QUAsi StellAr Radio source (because the 
              only 'appeared' like stars). The subsequent discovery of emission 
              lines with little or no radio emission led to the modern term QSO 
              (or Quasi Stellar Object), again partly because they could not bring 
              themselves to consider them as stars within the galaxy.</font></font> 
            </p>
            <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, 
              based on the extensive work of Y.P. Varshni it turns out quasars 
              were stars after all; they are laser stars within the galaxy. Hence 
              the similarities of the properties quasars such as Cygnus-A and 
              3C 345 with those of other objects within the galaxy like Eta Carinae, 
              MWC 349, NGC 7027, SS433 and Young Stellar Objects (YSO). In fact 
              their properties are so similar that two recent 'radio stars', GRS 
              1915-105 and GRO J1655-40 have been nicknamed 'mini-quasars' by 
              their discoverers.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering 
              this large amount of accumulating data on lasers associated with 
              confirmed radio stars within the galaxy, combined with the recent 
              discovery of 'Naked quasars' only adds fuel to the fire; it is high 
              time for the astronomical community to abandon the outdated and 
              obsolete quasar redshift interpretation.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 
              recent post from a quasar astronomer sci.astro responding in a newsgroup 
              to concerns raised over the alarming similarities between the jets 
              of the 'radio star' GRS 1915+105 and quasar jets:&nbsp;</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 
              quasars show superluminal sources, but just because an object shows 
              superluminal motion does not make it a quasar. In fact, I think 
              this is a cataclysmic binary, so it has an accretion disk, like 
              we think quasars do, but it is on a much smaller scale.&nbsp;</font> 
            </p>
            <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 
              is a clearcut case of 'belief is stronger than reason'. He believes 
              so strongly that quasars are are extragalactic he immediately eliminates 
              the competition by claiming that it is ludicrous to compare quasars 
              with other objects confirmed within the galaxy. This comparison 
              is perfectly valid in a healthy scientific community commited to 
              impartial examination of all the evidence, without any prior bias 
              originating from a particular theoretical interpretation. Astrophysics 
              will progress when astronomers not brainwashed by the redshift myth 
              begin to open their eyes to this data.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
              other words he is claiming there are two physics involved here; 
              (1) The physics of ordinary stars and (2) The unusual physics of 
              quasars. This response is typical of staunch believers of a popular 
              religion: They don't see any conflict between their religion versus 
              the empirical sciences, they merely separate the two and all is 
              well. As long as the analytical methods of science are not used 
              to probe religious issues, which are matters of faith. This is a 
              pathological form of the Selection Effect, Belief has always been 
              stronger than reason. This division creates an unhealthy schizm 
              between the acceptable science of objects within the galaxy and 
              the 'amazing' extra-galactic world. Symptoms of range from the compartementalisation 
              of the various branches of astronomy to lack of communication between 
              galactic and extra-galactic astronomers.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></p>
