<h1>The STARLITE payload on STS-95 </h1>

<center> <b> Preflight description:</b></center>

<p> Part of the International Extreme-Ultraviolet Hitchhiker 3 (IEH-3), 
<i> Starlite </i>
comprises a 0.4-meter telescope with a spectrograph that will give
significant new views of the hot Universe. Its silicon-carbide
primary mirror maintains reflectivity beyond the
range of traditional mirror coatings, down to the limit
imposed on light from 
distant objects by hydrogen in our own neighborhood, at 912
Angstroms (0.0912 micrometers). What is really
new is the combination of this deep-ultraviolet sensitivity with
a large field of view, so that Starlite can observe nearby galaxies,
supernova remnants, and similarly large targets much more efficiently
than any of its precursors (such as 
<a href="http://praxis.pha.jhu.edu/hut.html">HUT</a> flown on STS-35 and STS-67
as part of the <i> Astro</i> payload) 
and upcoming missions such as the 
<a href="http://fuse.pha.jhu.edu"> Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic
Explorer (FUSE)</a>.</p>

<p> The Principal Investigator is Dr. Jay Holberg of the University of
Arizona in Tucson, with coinvestigators A. Lyle Broadfoot (Arizona),
Roberto Stalio (Trieste, Italy), Jayant Murthy (Johns Hopkins),
and William Keel (University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa).
The Starlite payload was fabricated at the University of Arizona's
Optical Sciences Center. The instrument package includes
two star-tracking systems, one with a 4.5 by 6.5-degree field for
initial acquisition, and a narrower-field tracker to maintain
instrument pointing as the shuttle orbiter's attitude changes.
The detector package includes a spectrograph designed to reject
Lyman-alpha emission from the Earth's extended hydrogen envelope
(geocorona) which can be a limiting factor for deep-UV observations
from low Earth orbit. Our measurements will cover the 912-1150 Angstrom
region, and will provide spatial as well as spectral information along
a 30-arcsecond by 30-arcminute slit (long enough to cross the Moon,
if we wanted to do that). The radiation is registered on a multianode
microchannel array (MAMA), and downlinked to the instrument
team at the Payload Operations Control Center, located at Goddard
Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. </p>

<p> Starlite is on a two-axis
mounting angled slightly outward from the orbiter's centerline, to
that it can observe all of the sky that is visible (that is, above the
horizon and not behind some part of the orbiter structure) at any
given time. There is a pointing limitation imposed by the orbiter's
typical attitude for this mission - to avoid the interfering effects
of "Shuttle glow" (an ultraviolet glow produced as the orbiter
impinges on the rarefied remnant of our atmosphere), the bottom of
the orbiter will generally face forward so that this glow doesn't
show up in the IEH-3 instruments' field of view (an attitude known as
"belly-to-ram"). Starlite is located
at the back of the payload bay on the port side, with UVSTARS facing
directly out the starboard side (which is "up" most of the time).
This means that a typical target will be accessible for
about 25 minutes at once. The instrument's location can be seen 
(as the gold-covered box pointing downward at lower left) in

<p> Some of the science targets that are high priorities for observation
by the Starlite team include:</p>

<li> The Cygnus Loop supernova remnant. Starlite will be able to map
how various atomic species respond to the passing shock wave from the
initial supernova (now about 14,000 years ago), showing details of
how the gas cools which previous observations have left unclear.

<li> The spiral galaxy M33. The nearest actively star-forming spiral
galaxy, these data occupy an important niche in comparison to optical
observations of the most distant galaxies. The expansion of the Universe
has made the ultraviolet light from these galaxies arrive here as
visible (or even infrared) radiation, so that ultraviolet
observations of such nearby galaxies are of special interest
as we attempt to unravel how galaxies formed and evolved. These
data will complement an additional set of observations scheduled
with the FUSE satellite next year, intended to probe the brightest
individual star-forming regions in M33 for comparison with the more
diffuse regions that will be well studied with Starlite.

<li> Mercury. Pointing accurately so close to the Sun will require the 
orbiter pilot to set the its attitude
so that the wingtip acts as a sunshade.

<li> The newly discovered nova in Scorpius.

<li> The plasma torus around Jupiter's volcanic moon Io.

<li> Reflection nebulae. These clouds of dust, illuminated by neighboring stars,
afford an unusually good chance to measure the scattering properties,
and thus the physical nature, of the tiny grains of interstellar dust.

<li> Hot evolved stars in globular clusters. Some of these rich star
clusters contain unusual populations of very hot stars, which are best
isolated and probed in the deep ultraviolet. This spectral region
contains clues to the temperature and origin of these stars which are
potentially much clearer than in any other band.

<p> Supporting Starlite turned out to be interesting. The azimuth
bearing on the mount froze on orbit, so we had to find targets
within a 1-by-160 degree slice of sky (passing through the stuck
azimuth point in an outboard-tipped coordinate system) as we could. 
Spherical trig at 3 a.m. In any case, the telescope itself and detectors
worked as well as expected. We did manage to fish some stars in, map
a few regions of the Milky Way, and got the orbiter orientation changed
for half an orbit to do a "drift scan" halfway around the sky. 
Here's a view of the telescope in action in the payload bay, taken
from NASA TV by the staff of 
<a href="http://www.flatoday.com/space/index.htm"> Florida Today's</a>
Space Online staff and posted by permission. It's the silver tube
seen beyond the USC experiment package.</p>

<p> I think the Starlite team embarrassed some of the other ones in the
operations center, because we'd tend to let out cheers when the spectrum
of a recognizable target went through the slit. Alpha and Beta Muscae were
especially good, since we got them one after the other in the same
sequence (they're only about a degree apart).</p>
