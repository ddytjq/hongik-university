Food webs, which have long been central to ecological theory and experimentation, provide some of the most comprehensive depictions of species diversity and interactions available.  I am investigating the impacts of small to large biodiversity losses on ecosystems using network approaches and global optimization techniques to analyze high quality food-web data that incorporate topology, link strength, and dynamics.  By simulating the effects of removing species on the structure and function of empirical and model food webs, I hope to develop testable hypotheses about ecological "fault tolerance" and provide ways to distinguish the effects of reducing species richness from the effects of losing particular species' functions.

<p>
Macroevolution as a field has established itself as an integral part of evolutionary biology and has brought into focus a range of phenomena manifested at the phenotypic level, connected to the diversification of species, clades, and bodyplans, and played out over long periods of evolutionary time.  My research emphasizes multiple aspects of macroevolutionary pattern, such as diversity, disparity, and morphospace occupation, as well as novel contexts for the inference of process, such as those provided by evolutionary developmental biology and by complexity science.  Particular interests include the interplay between macroevolution and development, the dynamics of diversity and disparity, constraints on novelty generation, origination and extinction models and data, the relationship between fitness landscapes, epigenetic landscapes, and morphospaces, the relative importance of self-organization in ecology and evolution, and the structure of evolutionary theory.
</p>
<p>
Ongoing work has focused on sea urchin macroevolution and development; disparity and morphospace dynamics in evolutionary and ontogenetic time; new approaches to theoretical morphology; hominoid developmental evolution; temporal patterns of origination and innovation; statistical tests of hypotheses of self-organization and self-organized criticality in macroevolution; and morphological modularity.

<p>
Deep within the entangled bank that Darwin contemplated lies the rhizosphere, a complex milieu of interactions among many organisms. Therein, molecular signals mediate interactions between interdependent species engaged in the struggle for survival.  The spectrum of direct pairwise interactions ranges from competition to mutualism, determined ultimately by balancing the cost of the association against the benefits received.  How do plant hosts balance this equation, and distinguish between helpful and harmful microorganisms to defend themselves or cooperate, as appropriate?
</p>
<p>
As entire genomes are sequenced, an interesting phenomenon recurs: about half of newly-sequenced genes are of unknown function.  Organisms have evolved a diversity of responses to fluctuating environments, including mechanisms to alleviate abiotic stress and to regulate biotic interactions. Some of the mysterious genes are probably involved in buffering organisms to their changing environment via dynamic responses.  High-throughput DNA sequencing and parallel gene expression assay technologies shift the rate-limiting step of obtaining molecular biological insight from experimental data generation to data analysis.
</p>
<p>
Currently, my work complements that of experimental molecular biologists by developing methods that can help to understand the mechanisms of interaction between symbionts, whether antagonistic or mutually beneficial, and otherwise facilitate data acquisition and analysis in high-throughput contexts.  To understand how model organisms interact with and discriminate between beneficial and antagonistic symbionts, the challenge is to understand both the biochemical function of newly-sequenced genes and the processes by which their expression is regulated.  As increasing volumes of data become available, computational methods play an essential role in transforming experimental data into understanding.

<b>Supriya Krishnamurthy</b>, Physics
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
My research interests so far have mainly involved the study of non-equilibrium systems, in attempting to understand the nature of non-equilibrium steady states as well as how these steady states are approached in time. Some systems I have studied are: driven interfaces in disordered media, colloidal systems of aggregating and dissociating particles, models of self-organized criticality, models of domain growth, reaction-diffusion systems and granular media. These systems are studied by first modeling them and then investigating these models  both numerically (via Monte Carlo simulations) and analytically through exact or mean-field approaches.
</p>
<p>
In studying all these models, the hope is to perceive patterns and connections between them, which helps us understand these complex many-body systems better. Techniques used in understanding such systems may also then be exported to systems not generally studied within the realm of statistical mechanics, such as, biological systems or random networks etc. Currently, it is this aspect which I am interested in pursuing further.

<p>
I am interested in the short term fluctuations of economic aggregates.  In particular, the business cycle phenomena of national product and the stock price anomalies are my main research topics. An economy consists of numerous workers and firms, and yet it exhibits quite volatile and complex dynamics.  To understand this, I regard an economy as a network where each node serves as a buffer. My goal is thus to extract an underlying structure of interactions among industries or traders that governs the stochastic property of the flow on the network and the distribution of stock across the nodes.

<b><A HREF="/~jpepper/">John Pepper</a></b>, Evolutionary biology, especially multilevel selection and adaptation.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
My research focuses on the dynamics of multilevel selection, or systems in which natural selection acts simultaneously at more than one level in a biological hierarchy. Life is hierarchically organized, and most reproducing entities contain collections of smaller reproducing entities. Examples include genes, chromosomes, organelles, cells, organisms, colonies, and  mixed-species communities. As a result, selection can act simultaneously at more than one level of organization. Although each level of selection can be conceptualized as a separate process, they often interact in complex ways that can dramatically affect evolutionary outcomes. I work on extending and refining multilevel selection theory, and I also apply it to a range of problems. Most of these involve developing mathematical and/or computation models. Some current research questions include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the evolutionary dynamics of cancer?</li>
<li>How do genetic systems evolve to become more evolvable?</li>
<li>How can cooperation evolve among unrelated organisms?</li>
<li>What drives transitions in individuality?</li>
<li>How do allometric scaling laws affect the structure and function of ant colonies?</li>
</ul>

<b>Van Savage</b>, Scaling Laws in Biology
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Scaling laws in biology are well documented and date back to Galileo. One of the most fundamental of these is the finding that metabolic rate scales like body mass to the 3/4 power. This scaling is valid over a range of 21 orders of magnitude and has been known and yet unexplained for over 50 years.
</p>
<p>
Recently, a model was proposed by  Brown, Enquist, and West that is able to derive a large set of scaling laws for biological systems based on the assumptions that essential materials are transported through a network of branching tubes that terminate in branches that are invariant in size. The model predicts that the 3/4 power law is a leading-order approximation to the way organisms truly scale. Calculating corrections to this 3/4 law would allow more stringent testing of the model and a deeper understanding of the nature of the system. These calculations would help explain possible deviations for smaller animals. I am currently working on these calculations.
</p>
<p>
In addition, we have now included temperature as part of the scaling of biological rates by observing that metabolic rate is dependent upon biochemical reaction rates, which depend upon a standard Boltzmann factor. This allows us to express quantities related to  biological rates such as metabolic rates, growth rates, and life spans in terms of body mass and temperature.   Surprisingly, most of the variation in physiological times across a broad range of organisms including unicells, plants, fish, birds, and hibernating mammals seems to be determined solely by mass and temperature, providing a universal definition of physiological time. That is,  one gram of an organism at $20^{o}$ C metabolizes at approximately the same rate regardless of the organism from which it came.
</p>
<p>
My group has begun working on the implications that this universal time has for population growth rates, molecular evolution rates, and more. An eventual goal is to understand how energy fluxes scale for entire ecosystems. This would be a major advance and could be useful for developing strategies to deal with carbon sequestration and global warming.
</p>
<p>
Some other research goals for the future will focus on understanding the interface between networks. This could lead to models that describe how respiratory and cardiovascular networks complement one another, how amounts of gray matter scale with white matter in the brain, and how an animal's biological networks and therefore, metabolic and growth rates, are affected by the presence of a fetus or a tumor. Beyond these strictly biological applications, I would like to apply this model to other systems such as river systems, urban networks, and economic hierarchies.
</p>
<p>
I believe all of this work will lead to a more universal view of biological systems as being composed of and thus, constrained by branching networks--a simple structure that nature has used over and over again.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I work with Jim Crutchfield on "computational mechanics", a method for constructing an optimal statistical model of an unknown process from its observed behavior.  (This model represents both the causal structure of the process and its intrinsic computational powers.)  In the past I have worked mostly on the mathematical foundations of the method, and on using it to give quantitative definitions of "complexity", "emergence" and "self-organization". This still interests me, but is approaching the point of diminishing returns. Currently I am working on extending the method mathematically to new kinds of processes (e.g., cellular automata and network dynamical systems); on designing and implementing practical algorithms for applying the method to data; and on developing a theory for the rate at which these algorithms will converge on the ideal model as a function of the amount of data they are given, the complexity of the process, etc.  I am especially interested in applying the method to problems of physical pattern formation and of biological computation (e.g., neural coding or cellular signal transduction).
</p>
<p>
More nebulously, I also work on the collective behavior of adaptive agents.  I am especially interested in the interplay of individual learning and cognition with social interaction and structure.  I hope to use tools from computational mechanics, evolutionary theory, economics and symbolic dynamics to understand something about collective behavior, especially problems of distributed adaptation.  What I'd really like is to find something sensible and important to say about collective cognition --- the way groups of agents can coordinate their thinking to achieve cognitive feats that would be hard or impossible for any individual.  This falls somewhere between distributed computing, cultural evolution, and a kind of experimental sociology of knowledge.  Again, I hope to tie this to computational mechanics.

<p>
The main research project I am currently working on is "Decisionmetrics": the development of an empirical modelling methodology that will aid decision-making in complex environments. The aim of this project is to extend statistical decision theory for use in situations where decision-makers must use simple models that are therefore potentially poor approximations of their complex environment.
</p>
<p>
Agents operating in economic and financial environments are good examples of decision-makers of this type. The theory developed is therefore applied to the problem of developing models of returns on financial assets to be used in investment decision-making.

<b>D. Eric Smith</b>, Physics
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
My interests are loosely organized around the concept of self-organizing engines: dynamical systems that undergo phase transitions from quiescent states into patterned states that implement the transport cycles of engines.  There is one example from physics that I understand fairly well (thermoacoustic engines), and I am looking for others in biology or computation, in which less of the structure of physical energetics is given to us in a standard form.
</p>
<p>
Projects that I hope will develop in this direction are: Studying the thermodynamics of "reversible" machine-learning algorithms; Modeling the essential features of biochemical engines; Understanding financial markets as both transport systems and self-organizing structures.
</p>
<p>
I am also interested in the evolution of human propensity to assume, use, and invent grammatical languages.  The importance of ambiguity generation and resolution in the passage from iconic to grammatical languages may make this problem similar to satisfyability in computer science, so there is some hope that the tools of statistical mechanics will give concrete definitions to the notion of the "emergence" of grammar.

To be more specific, my current projects include work on various subbranches of the Nostratic macrofamily (primarily Dravidian), and, most recently, work on the Khoisan (Bushman-Hottentot) family for which I am developing a system of regular correspondences and eventually a set of reconstructed lexical proto-forms. This will later be incorporated into the global database of the world languages and their genetic relationships that is the ultimate goal of EHL.

<p>
I am broadly interested in the evolution of traits important in ecological interactions and how individual-level selection on these traits shapes levels above the individual.  As a postdoctoral researcher at SFI, I plan to investigate how specific ecosystem characteristics, like modularity, enhance the robustness of ecosystems to disturbance (resiliency) and whether these higher level characteristics can evolve from selection at the level of individuals.   In particular, I will use spatially explicit models to look at how local dispersal leading to the clustering of individuals in space may evolve and affect resiliency.
