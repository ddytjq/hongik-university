<h3>Ready, Fire, Aim </h3>
<h4>Close only counts in curling, horseshoes and nuclear war <br>
Please do not get these confused </h4>
 
<p>This column is the first in a series in which we will describe some new initiatives we have undertaken for 
the Provincial Laboratory of Public Health and University of Alberta Hospitals contracts to deliver more with 
less.  It is a hard fact in the last half of the last decade of the 20th century, that all sectors involved in medical 
care must carefully examine what they do and eliminate that which is of relatively low value. </p>
<p>We have distilled some guiding principles from the initiatives that we have completed. The first and the 
most important of these has to do with changing the planning cycle of a project.  Most conventional projects 
adhere quite closely to a planning cycle composed of these steps ready, aim, fire.  Ready corresponds to 
the planning phase of a project; What is the purpose of the project?  Who will do it?  What resources will be 
needed; people, money, and space?  Aim corresponds to the design phase; What will we do? When will we 
do it?  In what order will we do it?  Who will do each part?  Fire is the execution phase of the project and is 
the actual performance of the actions that were initiated and designed in the ready and the aim phases. </p>
<p>This planning cycle is so intuitive that it obscures the fact that in real life other combinations are possible 
and in fact additional phases are required. The single best example of the ready, aim, fire cycle is of course 
the firing squad. It is worth noting that a firing squad shares the same advantages and disadvantages as the 
ready, aim, fire design cycle, namely it works best with a stationery target, correct results are often 
guaranteed by redundancy 	e.g. six sharp shooters, and the responsibility for individual success or failure 
with so many shooters involved, is not always clear. </p>
<p>Another way of expressing the ready, aim, fire cycle is by three questions.  The first question is, What 
could we do? The second is, How will we do it? and the third is, Can it be done? There are two other 
questions not covered by this cycle.  Should we do this? and Have we done it properly? 
<p>A planning cycle that works better for us, particularly in attempting to hit a moving target has been called 
ready, fire, aim. An example of this is how artillery works. When an artillery unit sets up, they fire shells in 
the general direction the enemy is expected.  Spotters on the ground or in the air then locate where the shell 
has actually landed, feed back the information to the gunners and locations are re-calculated and additional 
shells are fired to verify that targeting is now accurate. The key component of this cycle is the counter-
intuitive idea that one can fire without having aimed precisely.  It is obvious to even the most casual 
observer that this can only work, if there is an evaluation of the outcome and this must feed back whether 
the shell is getting closer or further away from the target. This is in contrast to the ready, aim, fire school 
where planning is believed to guarantee a good result and as a consequence evaluation steps are rarely built 
in to the cycle. </p>
<p>The strengths of this model are that it does not depend on long elaborate planning phases, encourages 
small pilot projects to test validity of key components of designed solutions and since the time, money or 
labor commitment is kept small it allows multiple solutions to be examined and mistakes to be made with 
less disastrous consequences.  Frequent reality checks make it much less likely that the solutions will be 
ineffective or unwanted.  In its reliance on the process of feeding back the result of trying small experiments 
and listening carefully not just to what the customer wants but what they in fact need, the ready, fire, aim 
model has proved very useful to us in this rapidly changing environment. </p>
<p>The next issues of Biologos will carry articles on initiatives that we have undertaken or are undertaking 
using this design cycle. To clarify the differences between the two cycles, I would like to relate an incident 
that first triggered these ideas.  I was a resident at the Toronto General Hospital, when the administration 
decided that residents should know what their responsibilities were to the hospital. They wanted to create 
an orientation booklet which would include items such as how to 
rder an autopsy, the policy for ordering expensive antibiotics, etc. During the planning phase (Ready) I was 
asked as a resident, the person to whom the orientation booklet was directed, to give the committee some 
feedback as to what the residents would value in such a booklet. 
<p>All residents lack sleep, food and calm moments, so the time I spent with the committee was a 
significant sacrifice.  I indicated that there were three things that they absolutely had to accomplish with this 
booklet if they wanted it to be used by residents.
<ol> 
<li>It had to fit into the pocket of a lab coat.  
<li>It had to be loose-leaf so they could rip out the pages that were not relevant to them, since the average residents lab 
coat weighs about 10 kg.  
<li>It had to contain information that was useful to residents, like the hours the cafeteria was open, phone numbers for the laboratories, x-ray and to book tests, etc. </ol>
<p>	The committee thanked me kindly for taking time out of my busy schedule and proceeded to work for six 
more months on the booklet (Aim). They took information from a host of stakeholders including the nurses, 
laboratory, hospital administration, hospital finance, pathologists, coroners, College of Physicians and 
Surgeons.  I was asked to examine their prototype residents manual. I was somewhat disappointed to find 
that the book was 8 1/2 x 11, contained virtually no useful information, but it was in loose-leaf format.  I 
indicated to the committee my disappointment that they had neglected two out of the three design principles. 
They admitted that only the prototype was loose-leaf, the actual manual would be bound, so they had violated all three principles. 
<p>I went to orientation that year.  There were about 100 interns and residents who showed up at the 
orientation.  I counted the number of orientation manuals that were found in wastepaper baskets inside the 
room.  96 out of 100 failed to exit the four walls of the orientation (No evaluation step).  The committee 
privately blamed the residents for their total lack of loyalty and responsibility towards the Toronto General 
Hospital. 
<p>Ten years later I had the opportunity to do a small pilot project providing an orientation manual for 
residents at the University of Alberta Hospital.  It met all three of the criteria listed above and in addition 
through support of the hospital administration, Dr. Ron Wensel, Daytimer and Miles Pharmaceuticals we 
were able to include the information with a Daytimer to help the residents organize their time more 
efficiently.  It had been our intention only to hand these out to first year residents to have the most effect on 
their test ordering behavior.  We were unable to do this because after we handed out the forty to first year 
residents, there was a massive demand by residents from other years to also be given the orientation 
manual.  
<p>We will demonstrate in the Biologos issues to come that our initiatives have improved our performance 
consistently and in a way which is measurable and sustainable.  We will also show some examples of where 
we have been unable to achieve this; some of our reasons for failure are known and others are still unknown. 
<p>In conclusion, the ready, aim, fire design cycle has a place in stable environments in which changes 
must be perfect and close is not good enough.  In the real world, situations like that come up fairly rarely 
and it is by far more common to try to hit a moving target.  Information technology initiatives are a classic 
example of this since the speed of computers, the memory capacity and the software, ease of use, all seem 
to double in eighteen months.  In this situation a design cycle that quickly answers the questions, What 
could we do?, Should we do it?, Can we do it in a small project?, Did the small project meet most of our 
needs?, and then returns to the question &#147;What could we do now that we know a little more about the 
problem?&#148;, is a very useful tool.  </p>
