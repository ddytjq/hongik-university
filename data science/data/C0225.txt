              <br>
              </b><br>
              The period under review has seen difficult stock market sector and 
              underwriting conditions. The appetite for insurance stocks has declined 
              for a number of reasons, in particular, pipeline underwriting losses 
              and perceptions of the potential impact of the &#145;millennium 
              bug&#146; on insurers. Diminishing interest in the insurance sector 
              has made life challenging for a small stock like ours. Underwriting 
              conditions have remained extremely competitive although there are 
              strong indications of a return towards sensible rating conditions 
              in the motor insurance market. We remain committed to the establishment 
              of a fully Integrated Lloyd&#146;s Vehicle (ILV). This has determined 
              much of our activity over the period and continues to do so.&nbsp;</p>

              We are pleased to report a profit before tax of &pound;0.5 million 
              for the six months ended 30 June 1999 compared to a loss before 
              tax of &pound;0.5 million for six months to 30 September 1998. Earnings 
              per share showed a loss of 0.2p (30 September 1998 &#150; loss of 
              2.1p). The undiluted net tangible asset value per share at 30 June 
              1999 increased to 79.3p (30 September 1998 &#150; 71.8p).Your Directors 
              have declared an interim dividend for the period of 1.0p net per 
              share (30 September 1998 &#150; 1.0p). The dividend will be paid 
              on 21 October 1999 to shareholders on the Company&#146;s register 
              at close of business on 1 October 1999.The principal constituents 
              of the profit before tax are summarised below:<br>

              <br>
              We expect the motor market to show further improvement over the 
              next year. Substantial rate increases have been applied in a number 
              of areas and as the impact of market losses and legislative changes 
              is felt, these should begin to bite as other motor insurers are 
              forced to put up premiums.<br>
              <br>
              The improvements in premium rates and conditions in other markets 
              continue to relate to specific classes and are not widespread. We 
              see other Lloyd&#146;s syndicates writing risks 100% and offering 
              extended terms or multi-year deals. In our view this is unsustainable 
              and will militate against those underwriters when the market turns. 
              We will maintain our strict underwriting philosophy and strong underwriting 
              and management teams, so that when the upturn comes we will be well 
              placed to capitalise upon it.<br>

              <b>Current Underwriting Markets </b><br>
              <br>
              The motor market is hugely competitive. Margins are tight and, in 
              recent years, motor underwriters generally have charged insufficient 
              premiums to meet the cost of claims and servicing the business. 
              Legislative changes, the impact of the Ogden judgment and an increasingly 
              litigious society have worsened the position. Our motor syndicate 
              (587), whilst steadily increasing premium rates over the last eighteen 
              months and taking advantage of improvements in the fleet market, 
              has not been immune from these problems. Although the syndicate&#146;s 
              results are disappointing, we can draw some comfort from the fact 
              that we purchased a stop loss reinsurance to protect both the 1997 
              and 1998 years of account and this will ensure that our syndicate&#146;s 
              results will continue to be ranked among the best in the market. 
              One of its reinsuring companies, however, has gone into liquidation 
              and this will have an impact on the 1997 syndicate result.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span class="font">In the marine, 
              aviation and non-marine markets in which we operate, competition 
              also continues to remain strong with premium rates in many classes 
              at unacceptable levels. We continue to be resolute in maintaining 
              our underwriting disciplines and to turn away business where the 
              premium is insufficient or the terms are inadequate. So far the 
              catastrophes of 1998 have done little to quench the market&#146;s 
              thirst for business in these areas. It remains to be seen what impact 
              the current hurricane season, the Turkish earthquake, the Norwegian 
              Dream Channel collision and the three recent airline disasters will 
              have on premium rates in the second half of 1999.</span></p>

              for the 1997 and 1998 Underwriting Years <br>
              </b><br>
              We have recently received forecasts for the 1997 and 1998 underwriting 
              years prepared for the Lloyd&#146;s Syndicate Quarterly Returns 
              at 30 June 1999. The position for those syndicates comprising the 
              Group&#146;s spread portfolio and our own in house managed syndicates 
              is set out below.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span class="font">For the 1997 
              year, the Group underwrote &pound;53.2 million of capacity on a 
              portfolio of 49 third party managed syndicates. The mid-points of 
              the forecasts show an underwriting loss of &pound;0.3 million after 
              taking account of the additional Lloyd&#146;s Central Fund levy 
              for corporate members. The portfolio comprises a mixture of loss 
              and profit making syndicates and, under the accounting policy that 
              the Group is obliged to adopt when considering provisions for future 
              losses, the Group must only take account of loss making syndicates. 
              The loss making syndicates show a mid-point loss position of &pound;1.2 
              million which compares with &pound;0.9 million at the time the accounts 
              to 31 December 1998 were prepared and therefore, the Group has been 
              obliged to charge an additional &pound;0.3 million to the profit 
              and loss account for the six months ended 30 June 1999.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span class="font">For the 1998 
              year, the Group underwrote &pound;60.0 million of capacity on a 
              portfolio of 47 third party managed syndicates. The mid-points of 
              the forecasts show an underwriting loss of &pound;2.3 million after 
              taking account of the additional Lloyd&#146;s Central Fund levy 
              for corporate members. The loss making syndicates show a mid-point 
              loss position of &pound;2.5 million which compares with &pound;1.5 
              million at the time the accounts to 31 December 1998 were prepared 
              and therefore, the Group has been obliged to charge an additional 
              &pound;1.0 million to the profit and loss account for the six months 
              ended 30 June 1999.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span class="font">Through its shareholding 
              in Chaucer Dedicated Limited, the Group has a &pound;10.0 million 
              interest in a portfolio of Chaucer managed syndicates in the 1997 
              and 1998 years. The Group&#146;s share of the attributable mid-point 
              losses are &pound;0.2 million (1997) and &pound;0.3 million (1998) 
              which, after taking account of a small carried forward provision 
              and expenses for the six months ended 30 June 1999, have led to 
              a charge of &pound;0.5 million.</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span class="font">The individual 
              Chaucer syndicate forecasts are set out on the final page of this 
              document. The marine (1084) and non-marine (1096) syndicates show 
              mid point profits for both the 1997 and 1998 years. The motor syndicate 
              (587) shows mid point losses for both years which are characteristic 
              of that sector, but which are likely to compare favourably with 
              other Lloyd&#146;s motor syndicates. The aviation syndicate (173) 
              has suffered from a number of factors including a lack of investment 
              income, as a result of its 1996 (and prior) year being reinsured 
              outside that syndicate.</span></p>

            <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span class="font">Managed capacity 
              on our own syndicates for 2000 will remain approximately the same 
              as for 1999 although the balance will alter. Motor capacity is to 
              increase by 7.40% to take advantage of the upturn in rates. Capital 
              providers have approved our plan to expand non-marine capacity by 
              21.25% to exploit a number of opportunities. However, due to the 
              highly competitive conditions in the marine and aviation markets 
              we have decided to reduce capacity on syndicate 1084 by 22.50%.</span></p>

              The Group&#146;s major underwriting interests are through the ALIT 
              corporate members. With the approval of Lloyd&#146;s, the number 
              of active ALIT corporate members has been reduced from five to one. 
              In 1999 ALIT (No 1) Limited provided underwriting capacity of &pound;58.5 
              million, of which &pound;42.9 million was allocated to Chaucer managed 
              syndicates and &pound;15.6 million to syndicates managed by other 
              agents. This third party capacity, which has a book value of &pound;0.2 
              million, is to be sold in this year&#146;s auctions and is likely 
              to raise approximately &pound;2.4 million. The profit will be shown 
              in the accounts for the year ended 31 December 1999.<br>
              <br>
              Chaucer Dedicated Limited (CDL) is the Lloyd&#146;s corporate member 
              established to provide dedicated capacity to Chaucer syndicates. 
              The Group has a 100% share in the 1997 results and 33% in 1998 and 
              1999. Capacity was increased from &pound;30 million to &pound;50 
              million for 1999 and is likely to be at least &pound;55 million 
              for 2000.</p>
            <p class="font" align="left">The Group currently has the funding available 
              to underwrite up to &pound;74 million for the 2000 year through 
              ALIT (No 1) Limited. Subject to the ability to purchase additional 
              Chaucer capacity at reasonable prices, our underwriting through 
              ALIT (No 1) is expected to increase for 2000 year of account and 
              may approach our maximum underwriting resources.<br>

              173 in Run Off </b><br>
              <br>
              Syndicate 173 was formerly managed under a consortium agreement 
              with Amlin Underwriting Limited. The agreement was terminated at 
              the end of 1998 and the syndicate placed in run-off. The 1996 (and 
              prior) year was closed into Amlin Syndicate 2001 and it is anticipated 
              that both the 1997 and 1998 years of account will close similarly 
              into that syndicate on equivalent terms to the closure of its aviation 
              component.<br>

              <b>Investments </b><br>
              <br>
              At the commencement of the six months under review, the Group held 
              46.4 million units in the Aberdeen UK Growth Unit Trust with a value 
              of &pound;37.9 million. On 19 January 1999, the opportunity was 
              taken to move 40% of the Group&#146;s investments into a fixed interest 
              fund. As a result, the Company sold 18.0 million units in the Aberdeen 
              UK Growth Unit Trust to realise approximately &pound;15.0 million 
              and used the proceeds to purchase 50.0 million units in the Aberdeen 
              Fixed Interest Unit Trust. On 5 May 1999, we sold a further 13.5 
              million units in the Aberdeen UK Growth Unit Trust and invested 
              in a further 38.2 million units in the Aberdeen Fixed Interest Unit 
              Trust.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="font" align="left"><span class="font">The investment portfolio 
              at 30 June 1999 comprised 15.0 million units in the Aberdeen UK 
              Growth Unit Trust and 88.3 million units in the Aberdeen Fixed Interest 
              Unit Trust. The value of the portfolio at 30 June 1999 was &pound;40.1 
              million, and has given the Group an investment gain of &pound;2.3 
              million for the six months. The Aberdeen UK Growth Unit Trust continued 
              to perform satisfactorily, showing an increase of just over 7%, 
              thereby keeping pace with the FTSE 100. The Aberdeen Fixed Interest 
              Unit Trust is unlikely to produce the same capital appreciation 
              but carries a yield of 8%.<br>

              <b>Chaucer Europe </b><br>
              <br>
              In line with plans to expand our underwriting business, we have 
              successfully established two new European businesses. In April 1999 
              we announced the establishment of Chaucer GmbH based in Hanover, 
              Germany and, shortly afterwards, the acquisition of the business 
              of the Vesta Fire Insurance Corporation of America based in Copenhagen. 
              These businesses have been acquired in order to establish, at low 
              cost, a presence in Europe from which to develop business. As access 
              to new business increases we expect to see further developments 
              of this kind.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Syndicate 587 Office </b><br>
              <br>
              On 16 September 1999, we signed a contract to purchase 4 acres of 
              freehold land at Whitstable near Canterbury on which a new 35,000 
              square foot office for the motor syndicate (587) will be built. 
              Work will commence shortly and occupation is scheduled for mid 2000. 
              The site has planning permission for 60,000 square foot of office 
              space, allowing for future expansion. The total cost including land 
              will be in the region of &pound;5 million and will be financed through 
              a mixture of cash resources, borrowing and the exchange of the Group&#146;s 
              existing freehold building in Canterbury which was purchased earlier 
              in the year for &pound;825,000. The offices will be leased to the 
              syndicate at a commercial rent.</span></p>
            <p class="font" align="left"><span class="font"><b>Year 2000</b><br>
              <br>
              Year 2000/Millennium compliance revolves around the ability of computer 
              systems to recognise and correctly interpret date data fields. Problems 
              are compounded by the fact that many systems interact (interface) 
              with other systems, all of which must be Year 2000 compliant. The 
              Group is conscious of the potential impact that non compliance could 
              have on profitability owing to its dependency on a number of critical 
              systems in order to manage the business.<br>
              <br>
              While no organisation is able to give guarantees as to its own Year 
              2000 compliance, the Group is near the completion of a rigorous 
              Year 2000 compliance programme carried out under the auspices of 
              Lloyd&#146;s, whose Year 2000 Certification Scheme, inter alia, 
              requires members of the market to complete the various stages of 
              the programme by pre-determined dates.</span></p>
            <p class="font" align="left"><span class="font">During Phase 1 of 
              the Scheme, Lloyd&#146;s required comprehensive information concerning 
              Year 2000 planning to be provided, including target dates for each 
              stage of the implementation of the plan, together with a detailed 
              budget to cover the cost of implementation. Phases 2 and 3 required 
              internal systems and their interface with the market&#146;s systems 
              to be tested. All of those phases have been successfully completed.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="font" align="left"><span class="font">During 1999, the Lloyd&#146;s 
              Year 2000 Certification Scheme requires the process of verifying

              to be continued and the development of contingency plans to minimise 
              disruption and ensure the continuity of the business. This has been 
              completed in line with the Lloyd&#146;s timetable and certification 
              has now been received.All expenditure associated with this work
