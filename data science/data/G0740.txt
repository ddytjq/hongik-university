Known to Al-Sufi about AD 905.
<p>
M31 is the famous <i>Andromeda galaxy</i>, our nearest large neighbor galaxy,
forming the <a href="../more/local.html">Local Group</a> of galaxies together
with its companions (including <a href="m032.html">M32</a> and 
<a href="m110.html">M110</a>, two bright dwarf elliptical galaxies), our 
<a href="../more/mw.html">Milky Way</a> and its companions, 
<a href="m033.html">M33</a>, and others.
<p>
Visible to the naked eye even under moderate conditions, this object was 
known as the "little cloud" to the Persian astronomer 
<a href="../xtra/Bios/alsufi.html">Abd-al-Rahman Al-Sufi</a>, who described 
<a href="../more/m031_alsufi.html">and depicted</a> it in 964 AD in his 
<i>Book of Fixed Stars</i>: It must have been observed by and commonly known 
to Persian astronomers at Isfahan as early as 905 AD, or earlier. 
<a href="../m-ref.html#allen">R.H. Allen (1899/1963)</a> reports that it was 
also appeared on a Dutch starmap of 1500.
Charles Messier was obviously unaware of this early reports, and ascribed its 
discovery to <a href="../xtra/Bios/marius.html">Simon Marius</a>, who was the 
first to give a telescopic description in 1612, but (according to R.H. Allen) 
didn't claim its discovery. Unaware of both Al Sufi's and Marius' discovery, 
<a href="../xtra/similar/hodierna.html">Giovanni Batista Hodierna</a>
independently rediscovered this object before 1654. Edmond Halley, however, 
in his <a href="../xtra/similar/halley_pt.html">1716 treat of "Nebulae"</a>, 
accounts the discovery of this "nebula" to the French astronomer 
<a href="../xtra/Bios/bullialdus.html">Bullialdus</a> (Ismail Bouillaud), 
who observed it in 1661; but Bullialdus 
<a href="../Mdes/dm031.html#bulliald">mentions</a> that it had been seen 
150 years earlier (in the early 1500s) by some anonymous astronomer 
(<a href="../m-ref.html#allen">R.H. Allen, 1899/1963</a>).
<p>
It was longly believed that the "Great Andromeda Nebula" was one of the 
nearest nebulae. William Herschel believed, wrongly of course, that its 
distance would "not exceed 2000 times the distance of Sirius" (17,000 light 
years); nevertheless, he viewed it at the nearest "island universe" like our 
Milky Way which he assumed to be a disk of 850 times the distance of Sirius
in diameter, and of a thickness of 155 times that distance.
<p>
It was William Huggins, the pioneer of spectroscopy, who noted the difference
between gaseous nebula with their line spectra and those "nebulae" with 
continuous spectra, which we now know as galaxies.
<p>
In 1912, V.M. Slipher of Lowell Observatory measured the radial velocity of the
Andromeda "nebula" and found it the highest velocity ever measured, about
300 km/sec in approach (a better value value is about 266 km/sec, according to 
Burnham). This already pointed to the extra-galactic nature of this object.
<p>
In 1923, Edwin Hubble found the 
<a href="../more/m031_cep.html">first Cepheid variable</a> in the Andromeda 
galaxy and thus established the intergalactic distance and the true nature of 
M31 as a galaxy. Because he was not aware of the two Cepheid classes, his 
distance was incorrect by a factor of more than two, though. This error was 
not discovered until 1953, when the 200-inch Palomar telescope was completed 
and had started observing.
<p>
At modern times, the Andromeda galaxy is certainly the most studied 
"external" galaxy. It is of particular interest because it allows studies of
all the features of a galaxy from outside which we also find in Milky Way, but
cannot observe as the greatest part of our Galaxy is hidden by interstellar 
dust. Thus there are continuous studies of the spiral structure, globular and
open clusters, interstellar matter, planetary nebulae, supernova remnants (see
Jeff Kanipe's article in <i>Astronomy</i>, November 1995, p. 46),  
galactic nucleus, companion galaxies, and more. 
<p>
Some of the features mentioned above are also of interest for 
the amateur: Even Charles Messier found its two brightest companions,
<a href="m032.html">M32</a> and <a href="m110.html">M110</a> which are 
visible in binoculars and conspicuous in small telescopes, and
<a href="../xtra/history/m-m31_42.html">created a drawing of all three</a>.
These two relatively bright and relatively close companions are visible in
many photos of M31, including the one in this page. 
They are only the brightest of a "swarm" of smaller companions which surround
the Andromeda Galaxy, and form a subgroup of the Local Group. 
At the time of this writing (October 1999), at least 10 of them are known: 
Besides M32 and M110 these are NGC 185, which was discovered by William 
Herschel, and NGC 147 (discovered by d'Arrest) as well as the very faint dwarf 
systems And I, And II, And III, possibly And IV which may however be a cluster, 
And V, And VI (also called the Pegasus dwarf), and And VII (also Cassiopeia 
dwarf).
<p>
The Andromeda Galaxy is in notable interaction with its companion M32, which 
is apparently responsible for a considerable amount of disturbance in the 
spiral structure of M31. The arms of neutral hydrogene are displaced from 
those consisted of stars by 4000 light years, and cannot be continuously 
followed in the area closest to its smaller neighbor. 
Computer simulations have shown that the disturbances can be modelled
by a recent close encounter with a small companion of the mass of M32.
Very probably, M32 has also suffered from this encounter by losing many 
stars which are now spread in Andromeda's halo.
<p>
The brightest of the more than 300 globular clusters of the Andromeda 
Galaxy M31, G1, is also the most luminous globular in the 
<a href="../more/local.html">Local Group of Galaxies</a>; its apparent visual
brightness from Earth is still about 13.72 magnitudes. 
It outshines even the brightest globular in our Milky Way, 
<a href="../xtra/ngc/n5139.html">Omega Centauri</a>, and
can be glimpsed even by better equipped amateurs under very favorable conditions, 
with telescopes starting at 10-inch aperture 
(see <a href="http://leo.astronomy.cz/">Leos Ondra</a>'s article
in <i>Sky & Telescope</i>, November 1995, p. 68-69). 
The <a href="../xtra/hubble.html">Hubble Space Telescope</a> was used to
<a href="../more/m031_g1hst.html">investigate globular cluster G1</a> 
in mid-1994 (published April 1996).
While the easiest, G1 is not the only M31 globular cluster which is in the
reach of large amateur telescopes: Amateur Steve Gottlieb has observed
<!a href="http://redshift.home.pipeline.com/gcm31.htm">
<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/id/jsredshift/gcm31.htm">
18 globular clusters of M31</a> with a 44cm telescope. 
With their 14-inch Newton and CB245 CCD camera, observers of the Ferguson 
Observatory near Kenwood, CA have 
<!a href="http://redshift.home.pipeline.com/gcm31ccd.htm">
<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/id/jsredshift/gcm31ccd.htm">
photographed G1 and four fainter M31 globulars</a>.
<p> 
The astrophotographer is even better off, as he can
gather the fainter light of the fine detail in the spiral arms, as in our image:
Amateurs can obtain most striking pictures even with inexpensive equipment, from
wide-field exposures to detailed close-ups. Also in photography, better equipment
pays off, as is demonstrated by our image, which was obtained by (and is courtesy
of) Texas amateur <a href="http://www.galaxyphoto.com/">Jason Ware</a>, with a 
6-inch refractor. 
<a href="../more/m031_image.html">More information on this image</a> is available.
<p>
The brightest star cloud in the Andromeda galaxy M31 has been assigned an own
NGC number: <a href="../more/m031_n206.html">NGC 206</a>, because 
<a href="../xtra/similar/herschel.html">William Herschel</a> had taken it into
his catalog as H V.36 on the grounds of his discovery observation of 
October 17, 1786.  It is the bright star cloud at the upper left, just below 
a conspicuous dark nebula, in our photograph (very conspicuous in the
<a href="../Jpg/m31.jpg">larger photo</a>).
<p>
Under "normal" viewing conditions, the apparent size of the visible Andromeda 
Galaxy is about 3 x 1 degrees (our acurate value, given above, is 178x63 arc 
minutes, while <a href="../xtra/supp/m_NED.html#m31">NED</a> gives 190x60').
Careful estimates of its angular diameter, performed with 2-inch binoculars,
by the French astronomer Robert Jonckhere in 1952-1953, revealed an extension
of 5.2 times 1.1 degrees (reported by Mallas), corresponding to a disk diameter 
of over 200,000 light years at its distance of 2.9 million light years, 
so that this galaxy is about double as large as our own Milky Way galaxy !
Its mass was estimated at 300 to 400 billion times that of the sun. 
Compared to the newer estimates for our Milky Way galaxy, this is considerably
less than the mass of our galaxy, implying that the Milky Way may be much denser 
than M31.
These results are confirmed by new estimates of the total halo masses,
which turn out to be about 1.23 trillion solar masses for M31, compared 
to 1.9 trillion for the Milky Way (<a href="#evans2000">Evans and 
Wilkinson, 2000</a>). 
<p>
The Hubble Space Telescope has revealed that the Andromeda galaxy M31 has
a <a href="../more/m031_hst.html">double nucleus</a>. This suggests that
either it has actually two bright nuclei, probably because it has 
"eaten" a smaller galaxy which once intruded its core, or parts of its only
one core are obscured by dark material, probably dust. In the first case, 
this second nucleus may be a remainder of a <a href="../more/lg-dyn.html">
possibly violent dynamical encountering event</a> in the earlier history of 
the <a href="../more/local.html">Local Group</a>. In the second case, the
duplicity of Andromeda's nucleus would be an illusion causes by a dark dust
cloud obstructing parts of a single nucleus in the center of M31.
<p>
Up to now, only one supernova has been recorded in the Andromeda galaxy, the
<a href="../more/m031_sAnd.html">Supernova 1885</a>, also designated 
S Andromedae. 
This was the first supernova discovered beyond our Milky Way galaxy, on
August 20, 1885, by Ernst Hartwig (1851-1923) at Dorpat Observatory in
Estonia.
It reached mag 6 between August 17 and 20, and it was independently found
by several observers. However, only Hartwig realized its significance. It
faded to mag 16 in February 1890.
