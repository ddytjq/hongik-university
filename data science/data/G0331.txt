<H1>The Four Pillars of the Standard Cosmology</H1>
<H5><I>`The evolution of the world can be compared to a display of fireworks that
has just ended; some few red wisps, ashes and smoke. Standing on a cooled
cinder, we see the slow fading of the suns, and we try to recall the vanishing
brilliance of the origin of the worlds.' Lemaitre.</I></H5>
<P>The four key observational successes of the standard Hot Big Bang model
are the following: </P>
<MENU>
<LI><A HREF="#expansion">Expansion of the Universe </A>
<LI><A HREF="#CMBR">Origin of the cosmic background radiation</A> 
<LI><A HREF="#nucleo">Nucleosynthesis of the light elements</A> 
<LI><A HREF="galaxies">Formation of galaxies and large-scale structure</A> 
</MENU>
<P>The Big Bang model makes accurate and scientifically testable hypotheses
in each of these areas and the remarkable agreement with the observational
data gives us considerable confidence in the model. </P>
<H2><A NAME="expansion">Expansion of the Universe </A></H2>
<P>The Universe began about ten billion years ago in a violent explosion; every
particle started rushing apart from every other particle in an early super-dense
phase. The fact that galaxies are receding from us in all directions is
a consequence of this initial explosion and was first discovered observationally
by <A HREF="bb_cosmo.html">Hubble</A>. There is now excellent evidence for Hubble's law which states that the
recessional velocity <I>v</I> of a galaxy is proportional to its distance <I>d </I>from us, that is, <I>v</I>=<I>Hd</I> where <I>H</I> is Hubble's constant. Projecting galaxy trajectories backwards in time
means that they converge to a high density state - the initial fireball. </P>
<P>The <B>Copernican or cosmological principle</B> states that the Universe appears the same in every direction from every
point in space. It amounts to asserting that our position in the Universe
- with respect to the very largest scales - is in no sense preferred. There
is considerable observational evidence for this assertion, including the
measured distributions of galaxies and faint radio sources, though the best
evidence comes from the near-perfect uniformity of the relic <A HREF="cmbr_home.html">cosmic microwave background radiation</A>. This means that any observer anywhere in the Universe will enjoy much
the same view as we do, including the observation that galaxies are moving
away from them. </P>
<P>The fact that the Universe is expanding - about every point in space - can
be a difficult concept to grasp. The analogy of an expanding balloon may
be helpful: Imagine residing in a curved flatland on the surface of a balloon.
As the balloon is blown up, the distance between all neighbouring points
grows; the two-dimensional universe grows but there is no preferred centre. </P>
<P></P>
<H2><A NAME="CMBR">Origin of the cosmic background radiation</A> </H2>
<P>About 100,000 years after the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe
had dropped sufficiently for electrons and protoons to cobine into hydrogen
atoms, p + e --&gt; H. From this time onwards, radiation was effectively unable
to interact with the background gas; it has propagated freely ever since,
while constantly losing energy because its wavelength is stretched by the
expansion of the Universe. Originally, the radiation temperature was about
3000 degrees Kelvin, whereas today it has fallen to only 3K. </P>
<P>Observers detecting this radiation today are able to see the Universe at
a very early stage on what is known as the `surface of last scattering'.
Photons in the cosmic microwave background have been travelling towards
us for over ten billion years, and have covered a distance of about a million
billion billion miles. </P>
<H2><A NAME="nucleo">Nucleosynthesis of the light elements</A></H2>
<P>Prior to about one second after the Big Bang, matter - in the form of free
neutrons and protons - was very hot and dense. As the Universe expanded,
the temperature fell and some of these nucleons were synthesised into the
light elements: deuterium (D), helium-3, and helium-4. Theoretical calculations
for these nuclear processes predict, for example, that about a quarter of
the Universe consists of helium-4, a result which is in good agreement with
current stellar observations. </P>
<P>The heavier elements, of which we are partly made, were created later in
the interiors of stars and spread widely in supernova explosions. </P>
<H2><A NAME="galaxies">Formation of galaxies and large-scale structure</A></H2>
<P>The standard Hot Big Bang model also provides a framework in which to understand
the collapse of matter to form galaxies and other large-scale structures
observed in the Universe today. At about 10,000 years after the Big Bang,
the temperature had fallen to such an extent that the energy density of
the Universe began to be dominated by massive particles, rather than the
light and other radiation which had predominated earlier. This change in
the form of the main matter density meant that the gravitational forces
between the massive particles could begin to take effects, so that any small
perturbations in their density would grow. Ten billion years later we see
the results of this collapse. </P>
<P>The standard cosmology, then, provides a framework for understanding galaxy
formation, but it does not tell us about the origin of the primordial fluctuations
required at 10,000 years. We must seek answers to questions like these from
earlier epochs in the history of the Universe. </P>
