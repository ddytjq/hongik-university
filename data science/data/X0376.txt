<p>Losing one's composure and resorting to violence is always regrettable.
But there's something especially tragic about fist fights between parents
at youth-sports events, where elders should be models of restraint and
sportsmanship.
<p>Last week, one father at a youth hockey practice in a suburb of Boston
attacked and killed another for not controlling rough play against his
son on the ice. He's been indicted for manslaughter.
<p>The incident left the nation wondering if too many parents take their
children's sports too seriously, losing sight of sports' real value.</td>

<h3>
<a href="http://www.fortmcmurray.com/fmmha/">A NOTE FROM THE PRESIDENT
OF FORT MCMURRAY MINOR HOCKEY</a></h3>
January 2, 2000
<p>Parents &amp; Players,
<p>More and more these days I have concerns about the level of senseless
violence and the lack of respect for fellow players that I see on the ice
in minor hockey. Because of this I will be talking to minor hockey players
at times during the season.
<p>However, at minor hockey we only have your kids for a few hours a week.
You, the parents, have them for the majority of the time. I would ask that
you all take the time to read this letter and communicate to your kids
that hockey is a game of skill; of passing, shooting, teamwork, stick handling,
goaltending and not a game of violence.
<p>In October of 1999 Aaron Moser was in our city and spoke to many minor
hockey kids about an on ice incident that left him paralyzed. Although
his was not a particularly violent episode it shows what can happen in
our game. He may pay us another visit and we hope to get more kids to see
him and hear his story. Let's not waste his message. Let's not have the
tragedy of an Aaron Moser in Fort McMurray.
<p>This year we have put STOP SIGNS on the back of our sweaters, a message
to stop before a hit on someone from behind. This is only part of the job.
We need your help to teach your kids not to turn their backs when they
see they are going to get hit. It may be a natural reaction but it puts
the person about to be hit in a very vulnerable position, where the chance
of injury is even higher than if they absorb the hit the proper way. If
they need more help in learning this, have them ask their coach for help.
<p>A hockey stick is intended for the purpose of passing, shooting and
handling a puck. All other actions such as slashing, hooking, and spearing
or cross checking are senseless and cowardly acts. Players who repeatedly
commit these acts will face suspensions. If the suspensions do not get
the message across, more serious suspensions or possible loss of minor
hockey membership could result.
<p>At the Bantam level this year I have observed several things that I
feel require comment. My view has been reinforced by the observations of
the Bantam convener.
<p>There is no place in minor hockey for fighting. In our association it
is a suspendable infraction. Repeat offenders have their suspensions doubled
on the second offense and if a third were to happen a meeting would be
held to find out why the player is not getting the message and whether
their season should continue.
<p>Body checking is part of hockey, at the PeeWee level and up, but it
has to be for the purpose of gaining control of the puck. It should not
be the only thing a player is on the ice for, and it should not be with
the intent of punishing or hurting another player. Also once the hit has
been given, a player should play the puck or move back to their position.
Too often I see a player stand and challenge another after he has given
them a hit. This only leads to retaliation or fights. If a player is the
recipient of a clean hit, get up and get back in the game, don't hack someone
across the leg.
<p>My last comments are this. BIG GUYS HIT BIG GUYS; BIG GUYS DON'T HIT
LITTLE GUYS. When it is obvious that the player about to be hit is smaller
or much less skilled, do not hammer them. Angle them off the puck and skate
them out of room. Show some respect for your opponents and remember what
injuries can happen on the ice. Some injuries don't heal and can change
a life forever.
<h3>
Hitting From Behind</h3>
Parents of all Hockey Players,
<p>On a recent weekend we had "4" incidents where players were penalized
for hitting from behind. Please encourage your kids not to:
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Hit from behind.</li>

<li>
Turn their back on a hit for self-protection, which only puts them in greater
danger.</li>

<li>
Turn their backs on a hit to draw a penalty.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>Parents: Don't vocally taunt referees when these calls are made.
<p>Please support us in trying to protect your kids. If you see your child
get away with one of these hits or see him turning to draw a penalty or
avoid a hit, talk to him and let him know the danger.

<p><font color="#000000">I have one son in novice next season and one about

are many adults associated with the game who just don't think that way.
It is very sad that a good number of people still go to the rink to see
the bloodshed! What's worse is that some of these people are parents....
Go figure!</font>
<p><font color="#000000">We have to be careful though! Lets not put the

believe that hockey has become worse in direct correlation to society's

<font face="Bell MT"><font color="#000000">There is no need for checking
in youth hockey</font></font></h1>
<b><font color="#000000">by <a href="mailto:jbigha1@mail.isd77.k12.mn.us">John
Bigham</a></font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">I would like to see checking banned from youth
hockey. The ban should be put in place by the associations throughout North
America. The paragraphs below&nbsp; describe why I have come to this conclusion
and why we must take every step possible to protect our young players from
harm.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Checking has always been a part of the great game
of hockey. As a result of improvements in equipment and the use of face
masks by all players, the game has changed. In the pre-face mask era, players
would stay on their feet as much as possible. A player's control is achieved
via the skate blade making contact with the ice. Once a player leaves his
feet to make a check or block a shot, he is no longer in control of his
body. The face mask gives a false sense of security.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Players in youth hockey now dive head first to
block shots and launch into other players with tremendous force to make
a check. They are no longer concerned about catching a puck, stick, elbow,
shoulder or knee in the face, which means they are unafraid of using their
bodies as fast moving and at times uncontrolled battering rams.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Hockey is played within the confines of wood,
steel and plastic barriers. Our young players do not realize the face mask
will not protect their necks. Being young, they do not understand or appreciate
the risks. Therefore, adults need to step in and protect them whenever
possible. The face mask was designed to protect the face from pucks and
sticks. It functions quite well for those purposes. Too often when our
youth put on that helmet/face mask it transforms them into invincible gladiators,
at least in their own minds.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">In youth hockey players are in the process of
developing physically and mentally at very different rates. As a result,
players at or near the end of growth spurts, with their coordination still
catching up, are checking players who may be two-thirds their size.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Hockey should be about passing, reading and reacting,
teamwork and forming life-long friendships, not life-long disabilities.
In youth hockey we should create a safe environment so players can mature
physically and mentally while learning personal and team skills, such as
stick handling, passing and shooting. Can this truly be accomplished when
young players have to worry about&nbsp; checking, which not only inhibits
the pure skill of the game but presents the possibility of catastrophic
injury?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Take the check out of all hockey below the high
school level and teach our young players skills as well as how to stay
on their skates at all times. Checking can wait until high school to be
introduced.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#000000">Aggressiveness is not taught but exists within
the athlete. Thus, players will learn to check quickly and safely when
they are more physically and mentally mature at the high school level.
Checking is meant as a method to take the opposing player off the puck,
not off the ice lashed to a back board. Let's develop hockey players first
and then add the excitement of the check at the high school level. This
is the only sane way to reduce injuries and increase skills in our young
players.</font></td>
