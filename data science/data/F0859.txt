<P>
While MS has turned into a virtually upgrade machine with new versions of
software and operating systems coming out every few months and software
lifecycles decreasing, it’s still the same old adage:  the more things
change, the more they stay the same!
<P>
Witness some still active user groups in my town:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>The DOS/CPM users group
  <LI>The Win3x users group
  <LI>The Atari users group
  <LI>The OS/2 users group
  <LI>The Amiga users group (wish I had bought one of those!)
</UL>
<P>
I’m retro in a lot of ways too (it’s cool to be retro!):  I still have a 386
PC at home with Win3x, VB3, and an old version of Office;  I still have a
486 with Win95, VB4, and Office 95.  And I still use these machines!  Why?
I hate to throw something out just because it’s old (I’m a packrat!).  Yes,
these machine still work and are adequate for the tasks at hand.  But
mainly, I still enjoy using them!  By adding some cheap RAM, these machines
perform almost as well as the new ones.
<P>
I’m not totally retro:  I dumped the 286, the IBM PC Jr., and the 14K (or
slower!) modems a long time ago.  Okay, I still have an old dot-matrix
printer (serial), and some dumb terminals lying around, but I use these
mainly for testing.  In fact, most of this old stuff is just for testing.  I
guess I could sell all this old junk, but I don’t think anybody would want
to buy it.  If so, the whole mess would net me maybe $100 – if I’m lucky!
<P>
If you think I’m retro, you should see most of my customers:  many have old
clunky mainframes with VT100 or Wyse50 terminals or IBM3270 monitors.  Most
aren’t hooked up to the Internet, so access (if any) is through dial-up
software with terminal emulation.  Some have Internet connections but the
end is still the same:  access a secure web page to get at... a Telnet
connection!  Another government customer is still using Win3x (their
contract hasn’t approved a 32bit OS yet).  One customer still has Lotus123
(the DOS version), and he loves and swears by it.
<P>
Do I resist change?  No, I welcome it!  Change is good.  I am kind of slow
to jump on the bandwagon of new technology – either hardware of software.
It’s not because I don’t want to - it’s because I don’t have the time or
money to invest in this new technology.  But eventually Win2K, VB.Net, or
"XP" will cross my path – intentionally or unavoidingly.  I’m not worried.
I’m ready for it!  I’ve been using computers for almost 25 years, and I’m
sure I’ll figure it out and adapt quickly.
<P>
So will I use the new "DotNet" technologies?  Maybe.  After they have
matured and been debugged and reworked, and have gained popularity and
acceptance, I might jump on board.  But in the meantime, I have better
things to do than learn technology that “might” be popular in the future.
Besides, I’m too busy learning already popular technologies, like ASP and
Perl and Java and Flash. :^)
<P>
P.S.  Update:  I just got a new machine with Win2K and love it!  Did I have
any problems adapting?  No way!  And VB6 screams on it!  I did have to
re-write some of my animation routines to slow them down – they ran so fast
I couldn’t even see the graphics!
<P>

<TR><TD><B>Happy Birthday UNIVAC</B></TR></TD>
</TABLE>

50 years ago on June 15, 1951, the first commercial computer UNIVAC was born. It weighed 8 tons, was the size of a garage, and cost $1-1.5 million.
<P>

      <LI>1.3 MHz processor

    Yours for only $1.6 million!

</TABLE>
<P>
This system is roughly 1/1000th the speed of the desktop system I just bought for 2000 times as much money making my $/Hz ratio 2 million times better than UNIVAC's.
<P>
Also note that modern processors do a LOT more than UNIVAC's vacuum tubes so each MHz now can mean more than it did then.

<TABLE WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#00C0FF">
<TR><TD><B>Hard Wired Code</B></TR></TD>
</TABLE>
The first computer programs were electronic experiments.
You "programmed" the computer by rearranging wires to make current flow
through different circuits. Outputs were glowing lights rather than my nice
1024x768 pixel monitor that displays more than 16 million colors.
<P>
These days computers are basically boxes full of circuit boards, cables,
cabinets, power supplies, memory modules, disks, modems, and other peripherals whose
sole purpose is shoveling data in and out of the tiny chip at the center of it all.
<P>
Chips contain specialized circuits that do things like add numbers
and store a value in a memory address. Commands stored in memory determine
which circuits are used and how. The computer feeds the instructions to the
chip to make it do its magic.
<P.
The chip's commands are stored in the zeros and ones of machine code.
Assembly code is basically a more readable form of machine code that uses text
abbreviations to represent the zeros and ones of machine code.
On top of assembly comes higher level compilers and libraries such as the Visual
Basic runtime libraries. Above even that are interpreted languages and 4GLs including
Visual Basic and some database languages.
<P>
Sometimes after I've written a few thousand lines of Visual Basic and produced
some cool <A HREF="pictures.htm">ray traced picture</A>, it's humbling to think
about everything that's going on underneath it all. Including the Visual Basic runtime
libraries, my program takes several megabytes. Drawing a complex picture involves
<B>billions</B> of calculations! Imagine what that would be like if you had to build
the program by rewiring physical circuits. It would probably be faster than my program
because it would be analog and it could probably calculate the color of every pixel
at the same time, but it would be enormous and would probably take years to build.

<TR><TD><B>The Origin of the Species</B></TR></TD>
</TABLE>

My father, Ken Stephens, was one of the pioneers of computer programming.
As far as I know, he didn't invent any earth-shaking hardware or higher level
programming languages. He was one of the thousands of steely-eyed missle men
who helped drag computer programming out of its infancy. They sent rockets to the moon
with less computing power than you probably have in your wristwatch.
<P>
You can see these men at their best in a great scene in the movie <B>Apollo Thirteen</B>.
When a slightly dizzy Tom Hanks asks Mission Control to verify one of his calculations,
a row of engineers with thick glasses, short haircuts, and white shirts whip out their
slide rules and spring into action. Their slide rules were more accurrate than the expensive
and feeble calculators available the time. My father knew how to use a slide rule.
He showed me how to do some simple multiplication and take square roots once, but of course
I've forgotten how.
<P>
Back in the early days, there were no programmers, software engineers, user interface designers,
or Web designers. There were only electrical engineers. You couldn't get a degree in programming
(actually that's a relatively new innovation--even after my time), you could only get a degree in
electrical engineering. You not only had to understand how the hardware worked, you had to build it.
<P>
At times the hardware and software specialists had heated debates (pun intended) over
temperature issues. The software people claimed that the hardware started generating faults
when it got too warm. The hardware experts insisted the problem was buggy software.
Eventually it turned out that the programmers were right. When a semi-conductor gets hot enough,
it becomes a full-conductor and the computer doesn't work right.
<P>
That's why your computer has a fan.
If you have a reasonably new computer, the chip has a huge heat sink glued to it to keep it cool.
If your chip gets too warm, it won't work and may even suffer permanent damage.
<P>
These arguments also remind me of some of the battles I've been through where a developer or software vendor blamed
their bugs on the hardware, operating system, or another vendor's product.
<P>
Early memory systems were cumbersome affairs of wire woven into a rug holding tiny metal cylinders. The components
were so large you could easily see them with the naked eye. 
Today's memory chips store millions of bits of information in the space of a postage
stamp using components so small you need an electron microscope to see them.
<P>
Long term storage was even stranger. Some systems used huge magnetic platters, kind
of like CDs only more than a foot in diameter. Others stored data on rotating drums.
Still others used paper tape, punched cards, and even stranger media. I remember one time, probably
in the 70's, when my father showed me a removable disk pack. It was a big plastic disk about
4 inches tall and 14 inches in diameter. Inside was a single magnetic platter similar to a modern
floppy disk only holding far less information.
<P>
All of these systems had one thing in common: they were huge.
If you could store more than a few kilobytes, you considered yourself lucky.
Amazingly, those early engineers managed to send rockets to the moon with these
systems. My father worked on a missle guidance system thath used rotating drum memory.
Space was so tight that at times they broke bytes into two pieces called <B>nibbles</B>
and stored a machine instruction in one nibble and a piece of data in the other!
<P>
I remember him telling me that at one test, a missle's gyroscope tumbled 180 degrees just before launch.
(You may know that gyroscopes tend to tumble in 90 degree increments if they tumble at all).
The missle executed a perfect flight, but in exactly the wrong direction. Instead of going south, it went north.
Fortunately they were holding the test in the middle of the Pacific Ocean so no one was hurt.
They never did find out what happened.
