            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Much 
              of the learning of astronomy in this country is done outside the 
              formal classroom, in institutions and through organizations that 
              sometimes interact with the schools (through class visits, for example) 
              and sometimes act independently. These include planetaria, science 
              museums, observatory visitor centers, NASA facilities, youth groups, 
              and many similar organizations. I can examine each category only 
              briefly here, and want to comment mainly on the organizational strengths 
              that they bring to the task of astronomy education. </font></p>

              </font></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There 
              are approximately 1,100 planetaria in North America, visited by 
              millions of people each year.) About 30% of these serve school groups 
              only, while about 60% do both school and public shows. For many 
              youngsters, a planetarium visit is their first (and in some cases 
              only) introduction to astronomy. The quality of this introduction 
              can vary widely, depending on the skill and background of the presenter 
              and how the planetarium environment is used. Nevertheless, most 
              children have a fond recollection of their planetarium experience, 
              and for many children in cities, it may be the only time they really 
              experience a dark night sky. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Planetarium 
              educators are organized into a number of regional organizations, 
              and into the International Planetarium Society (although not everyone 
              belongs to these groups.) My main observation of the field is that 
              planetarium educators tend to be somewhat isolated from the astronomy 
              research and even college education community; this can occasionally 
              lead to some problems in keeping up with current science, but I 
              don't think these are a major cause for concern. More important 
              is a sense that planetarium educators get of being peripheral to 
              astronomy, despite the large numbers of people for whom they serve 
              as primary contact with the world of astronomy. I think it would 
              be very useful for the main astronomical societies to make more 
              of an effort to involve and get involved with the planetarium enterprise; 
              the AAS has recently taken some first steps in this direction. </font></p>

            <p> </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Many 
              science museums have astronomy exhibits, where visitors can read 
              or participate in activities relating to astronomy or at least space 
              exploration. Many museums also sponsor youth and education programs 
              after school or on weekends. As in planetaria, there are many museum 
              visitors who are first exposed to modern astronomy through such 
              programs. Science museum educators also have an organization, called 
              the Association of Science and Technology Centers (ASTC), with offices 
              in Washington. The same comments I made above for planetaria would 
              apply to astronomy staff at many science museums as well. And astronomers 
              and astronomy research institutions could interact profitably with 
              a local science museum from time to time. The museum could gain 
              access to recent results, images, and surplus equipment, while the 
              astronomy institutions could gain local exposure and be able to 
              demonstrate their commitment to public education to funding agencies.

            <p> </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A 
              number of the major observatories are expanding or introducing visitors 
              centers at their sites, many of which have an educational as well 
              as a tourist component. Some of these centers accommodate a large 
              number of visitors; for example, the National Optical Astronomy 
              Observatory center on Kitt Peak has some 100,000 visitors per year. 
              An especially good center has been built at the Lowell Observatory, 
              where you can experience a computer simulation of a night at the 
              observatory. A new center has been put in at Arecibo in Puerto Rico, 
              with bilingual educational programs. Of course, there are budget 
              problems that prevent much expansion in this area, but my feeling 
              is that more cooperation among observatories and more communication 
              among those of us working in astronomy education would have a salutary 
              effect on these efforts. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Another 
              aspect of the work of observatories is responding to requests for 
              information from the public. Some observatories have developed excellent 
              materials of their own, others use the materials developed by such 
              groups as the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, NASA, NOAO, and 
              Sky & Telescope magazine. It would be helpful to have a national 
              database of available resources for those whose responsibility is 
              responding to public inquiries. </font></p>

              NASA Centers and Divisions </font></b></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> NASA 
              has extensive efforts to help in science education, on many fronts, 
              but the agency is so large, and has so many centers and divisions 
              that the education situation is complicated. My impression is that 
              even NASA people don't know what all the different branches, missions, 
              and centers are doing, and there still much less coordination among 
              the many different programs than an outside observer might expect. 
              </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> NASA's 
              Education Division produces a lot of educational materials, mostly 
              about space flight, but some about astronomy and space science. 
              But because of government regulations that prevent the government 
              from competing with private industry, NASA distributes these materials 
              according to rules that can only be described as quantum mechanical. 
              If you happen to be at the right place at the right time, you can 
              get it free; if not, you probably can't even learn the material 
              exists. No database exists of these materials (at least as far as 
              I can find) and no one seems to be responsible for keeping the best 
              ones in print or updated. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> NASA 
              supports a wide-spread network of K-12 teacher resource centers 
              in a variety of locations around the country (the centers are of 
              varying size, quality, and effectiveness). The best of them are 
              at the NASA Centers themselves and can be important sources of information 
              and visuals for teachers about NASA programs for educators. There 
              is also a national network of Space Grant Colleges and Universities 
              whose educational programs also can vary all over the map in approach 
              and effectiveness. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
              part out of frustration with the Education Division, and in part 
              in response to Congressional pressure and its own interest in education, 
              the NASA's Office of Space Science (OSS) has in recent years already 
              undertaken an independent series of initiatives in education, which 
              include giving several million to the Space Telescope Science Institute 
              for public outreach and instituting a series of small grants for 
              educational projects called the IDEA grant program. These smaller 
              IDEA grants have been awarded to a number of astronomy and space 
              science institutions over the last few years, but there has been 
              little evaluation of the effectiveness of the grants or widespread 
              dissemination of the resulting materials. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Recently, 
              as we have pointed out, NASA has begun requiring that all new missions 
              have a built-in education component, and it will be interesting 
              to see whether and how the resulting infusion of funds will change 
              the way space science education is done in this country. The concern 
              that some of us have is that many NASA projects are simply striking 
              off on their own, and not coordinating, and often can spend their 
              resources creating materials for which the demand exists mostly 
              in the imagination of the scientists, not in the real classrooms 
              of this country. (How much demand is there really for information

            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But 
              now, a very welcome program which involves both coordination and 
              leveraging of OSS educational resources is being put in place under 
              the directorship of Dr. Jeff Rosendhal. Two reports, Partners in 
              Education: A Strategy for Integrating Education and Public Outreach 
              into NASA's Space Science Programs (Mar. 1995) and Implementing 
              the Office of Space Science Education/Public Outreach Strategy (Oct. 
              1996) have been issued and are well worth reading for their analysis 
              of the situation and novel proposals. OSS has just established a 
              network of educational forums and brokers/facilitators around the 
              country - institutions which will work to coordinate and leverage 
              the work and materials that individuals or groups produce in astronomy 
              and space science education to make sure they reach the widest audiences. 
              It will be very interesting to see how these NASA initiatives will 
              play out in the years to come. In the past, NASA has often played 
              the "Lone Ranger" in science education - proceeding as if no one 
              else existed in this field. The new era of cooperation and coordination 
              that seems on the horizon may mean that everyone - NASA and the 
              rest of us - will benefit from the sharing of resources and ideas.

              astronomy education programs that take place outside the formal 
              school systems include the Challenger Centers with their space flight 
              simulators for kids; the Young Astronauts clubs around the country, 
              which occasionally do astronomy activities; scout and other youth 
              groups, which have inspired many youngsters through astronomy merit 
              badges and similar programs; and summer astronomy and space science 
              camps, such as the one Don McCarthy and his colleagues have been 
              running at the University of Arizona. </font></p>
            <p> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In 
              response to some of the crises in K-12 education that I discussed 
              above, a number of interesting grass-roots efforts are springing 
              up to supplement science in the schools with after-school and summer 
              activities, sometimes in connection with a local science center, 
              youth group, or community organization. At the present time, there 
              is unfortunately no central clearing house that would keep track 
              of and disseminate the results of such efforts or coordinate their 
              activities. </font></p>
