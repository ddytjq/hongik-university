              will be a long and enjoyable retirement.</p>
            <p>The Newcastle Building Society Self Invested Personal Pension is 
              a new type of pension scheme that puts you in control and is offered

            <p>Advantages of investing in a SIPP: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Maximum flexibility of investments – a wide range of investments 
                is permitted, including commercial property, stocks and shares 
                and authorised unit trusts.</li>
              <li> Maximum control over investments – policyholders can make investment 
                decisions themselves, or appoint an IFA or investment manager.</li>
              <li> Maximum control over payment of benefits – policyholders can 
                defer annuity purchase until 75 and 'phase' retirement by drawing 
                down pension benefits a little at a time while leaving the rest 
                of the fund invested.</li>
              <li>Maximum control over death benefits – policyholders can pass 
                on savings to heir on death until annuity is purchased. </li>
              <li>Can consolidate several different pension plans under one wrapper.<br>

      <p>SIPPs are intended to provide individuals with more control over their 
        pension arrangements. They can offer peace of mind during uncertain economic 
        times and are a cost effective, tax efficient solution to a very real 
        problem. Today's low annuity rates will affect a great number of people 
        as they approach their retirement. A fund of &pound;100,000 will only 
        buy an annuity worth approximately &pound;7,500 per annum for a man aged 
        60*. And, if he were to die shortly after buying his annuity, in the majority 
        of cases nothing will be paid to his estate, leaving very little to show 
        for a lifetime's saving. 
      <p> 
      <p>For many people a SIPP will provide a potential solution, as it allows 
        the individual the freedom to choose where their funds are invested while 
        enabling them to draw down a regular pension from the investment profits 
        and capital, leaving the balance of the funds to pass on to a next of 
        kin.

      <p>Yes, even if you have other pension arrangements in place. However, if 
        you are already a member of a company pension scheme to which your employer 
        contributes, it would probably not be in your interest to withdraw from 
        the scheme in order to open a SIPP. 
      <p> 
      <p>If you are currently in work but have chosen to make your own pension 
        provision rather than take up your company scheme, then you should consider 
        the benefits of transferring your personal pension into a SIPP. If you've 
        already retired but have not yet purchased an annuity, then you should 
        also look at the advantages of a SIPP. The benefits of such a scheme could 
        be significant. 
      <p> 
      <p><b>If you are unsure about which pension is best for you, you are advised 
        to seek independent financial advice. </b>

      <p>Unlike many personal pension schemes, you would be under no commitment 
        to make regular contributions. The maximum contribution that can be made 
        to a SIPP is governed by your age and by parameters laid down by the Inland 
        Revenue. For example at present, anyone aged 51 to 55 can invest 30% of 
        their "net relevant earnings", while it's 35% for people aged 56 to 60 
        and 40% for anyone over 61. For people in employment, their net relevant 
        earnings are made up of salary, bonuses and taxable P11D benefits. For 
        the self-employed, it is their net earnings less trading expenses. 
      <p> 
      <p>Also, with a SIPP you can consolidate any existing pension arrangements 
        you might have by transferring the funds held into the new plan. 
      <p>Any contributions made to a SIPP qualify for income tax relief at your 
        highest rate of tax.

              an annuity must be purchased. 
            <p> 
            <p>A SIPP also provides the option of 'phasing retirement'. The assets 
              of the SIPP are split into segments and the SIPP member can elect 
              to 'cash' a number of units each year. In this way, any funds remaining 
              in the SIPP continue to grow in a tax free environment, while the 
              SIPP holder can delay the purchase of an annuity in the hope that 
              rates will improve. The benefits of phased retirement make a SIPP
