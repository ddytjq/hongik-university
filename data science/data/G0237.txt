</ul>

Charles Messier was born in <a href="badonvil.html">Badonviller</a>, 
Meurthe-et-Moselle, Lorraine, France (20 miles from Luneville), then part of 
the Principality of Salm, as the 10th of 12 children of Nicolas Messier, 
a catchpole in Badonviller, and Francoise b. Grandblaise, and grew up in 
humble conditions. Six of his brothers and sisters died at young age, and in 
1741, when Charles was 11, his father died. He had to finish his school 
education, and the family had even less opportunity for any betterment. 
<p>
Charles got interested in astronomy when he was 14 years old, and a great 
6-tailed comet appeared. This interest was further stimulated by an annular 
Solar eclipse which was visible from his hometown on July 25, 1748.
<p>
In 1751 he went to Paris, where he arrived in October. He was employed by the
astronomer of the Navy, <i>Joseph Nicolas Delisle</i>, because of his fine 
hand-writing. His first job was copying a large map of China. Besides this 
activities, he got introduced into the observatory on 
<a href="cluny.html">Hotel de Cluny</a> by Delisle's secretary, Libour.  
This man also instructed him to keep careful records of his observations.
Charles Messier's first documented observation was that of the Mercury transit
of May 6, 1753.  
Delisle himself introduced him into elementary astronomy and convinced him 
of the usefulness of measuring exact positions of all observations -- without 
doubt one of the most important preliminaries for the success of his catalog. 
In 1754, he was regularly employed as a Depot Clerk of the Navy.
<p>
Somewhen in 1757, Charles Messier started looking for comet Halley. 
His first reported observation of <a href="../../m/m032.html">M32</a>, 
a companion of the Andromeda galaxy, took place in the same year 1757.
<a href="../supp/halley.html">Comet Halley</a> was expected to return in 1758, 
which, at that time, was no more than a scientific hypothesis.  
Delisle himself had calculated an apparent path
where he expected comet Halley to appear, and Messier created a fine star 
chart of this path. Unfortunately, there was a mistake in Delisle's 
calculations, so that Messier always looked at the wrong positions. 
However, he discovered another comet on August 14, 1758, which he followed 
and carefully observed with telescopes to November 2, 1758. 
During these observations, he discovered another comet-like patch in Taurus 
on August 28, 1758. 
Evidently, it turned out that this patch was not moving, and was thus indeed 
not a comet, but a nebula. He measured its position on September 12, 1758, 
and it later became the first entry, <a href="../../m/m001.html">M1</a>, 
in his famous catalog -- this object later turned out to be one of the most 
interesting objects in the sky, the remnant of the supernova 1054, now 
commonly called the Crab nebula. It was also this first discovery of a 
comet-like nebula which triggered Messier to both looking for comets with 
telescopes, thus "inventing" comet hunting, a new discipline of astronomy 
in these days, and to compile his catalogue of nebulous objects which might 
be taken for comets.
<p>
Comet Halley was finally discovered by the German amateur astronomer 
Johann Georg Palitzch in the Chrismas night (December 25-26) of 1758.
Messier independently found it on January 21, 1759, about 4 weeks later,
when he finally doubted the correctness of Delisle's path. Delisle however did
not believe in this fault, advised him to continue observing, and refused
to announce his discovery. Messier as loyal employee stated: "I was a loyal
servant of M. Delisle, I lived with him in his house, and I conformed with his
command." When Delisle finally announced the discovery on April 1, 1759, it was
not believed by the other French astronomers (perhaps they took it as an April
Fool's joke).
<p>
Perhaps this disappointment and frustration was even more stimulating to the 
28-year old observer, so that he devoted his professional life to comet hunting. 
This devotion suffered from a further frustration (and perhaps got further 
emphasized) when Delisle refused to publish a further comet discovery by Messier
in early 1760.
<p>
In the following, Delisle changed attitude, supported Messier, and let him do
his own observational work. Messier recorded his second "nebula", 
<a href="../../m/m002.html">M2</a> (previously discovered by Maraldi), and 
plotted it on a chart showing Comet Halley's track.  
He observed the transit of Venus in 1761, and the appearance Saturn's rings. 
He observed Comet 1762 Klinkenberg from May to July, 1762, and
on September 28, 1763, he discovered Comet 1763 (Messier), and the next one, 
Comet 1764 Messier, on January 3, 1764 (this one was as bright as 3.0 mag when 
discovered, according to Don Machholz). 
A first hope to enter the French <i>Acad&eacute;mie Royale des Sciences</i> 
[Academy of Sciences] in 1763 did not come true, a considerable disappointment 
for Charles Messier.
<p>
With the discovery of a further "nebula", his third object (globular cluster 
<a href="../../m/m003.html">M3</a>) and his first original discovery, it seems 
that he undertook a serious scan of the skies for these objects, as they could
frequently fool comet discoverers. Besides own scans, leading to 19 original 
Messier discoveries that year, he used the catalogs of Edmond Halley (6 objects), 
William Derham (who chiefly had extracted from Hevelius' <i>Prodomus 
Astronomiae</i>)
which was available in a French translation by P. de Maupertuis, and
<a href="lacaille.html">Lacaille's Catalog of Southern "Nebulae"</a> of 1755,
as well as lists of Maraldi and Le Gentil, with some references to (but very 
probably not the list of) De Ch&eacute;seaux. 
He cataloged the objects 
<a href="../../m/m003.html">M3</a>--<a href="../../m/m040.html">M40</a>
this year, and looked for several non-existent nebulae from the older catalogs
(certainly without success, but this explains why the double star 
<a href="../../m/m040.html">M40</a> entered his catalog).
<p>
At that time, Messier was in vivid correspondence with astronomers and other 
academicians in Britain, Germany, and Russia. His Russian correspondent, 
Frederick La Harpe, was exile from Swiss and member of the Academy of sciences. 
On La Harpe's recommendation, Messier was named to the Academy of St. 
Petersburg in Russia.
Moreover, on December 6, 1764, Charles Messier was made a foreign member of 
the Royal Society in London.
<p>
Early in 1765, he found the star cluster <a href="../../m/m041.html">M41</a>.
In 1765, Delisle eventually retired, and Charles Messier continued observing 
from the Hotel Cluny observatory; his appointment as Astronomer of the Navy 
occurred considerably later, though: Not before 1771! 
<p>
On March 8, 1766, he discovered a new comet, and co-discovered one more
on April 8 of that year. 
<p>
In 1767, Messier, the long-term Depot Clerk and later Astronomer of the Navy, 
took part in the only naval journey in his life, in order to test and regulate 
some new marine chronometers, constructed by J. Le Roy. Therefore, he went on 
the ship <i>L'Aurore</i> for a 3 and a half-month voyage in the Baltic, 
together with his colleague Alexander-Guy Pingr&eacute; (1711-96).  Messier 
did the astronomical observations and Pingr&eacute; the necessary calculations. 
During his absense from May 12 to September 1, 1767, Lalande continued the 
observing program at Cluny.
<p>
In early 1769, Messier must have decided to publish a first version of 
<a href="m-cat.html">his catalog</a>,
and to enlarge the number of objects, cataloged the well known objects
<a href="../../m/m042.html">M42</a>--<a href="../../m/m045.html">M45</a> 
(Orion Nebula, Praesepe, and the Pleiades). 
<p>
On August 8, 1769, Messier discovered a new comet (1769 Messier, the Great 
Comet of that year). He sent a description and a map of this comet's discovery 
to the King of Prussia, who was so impressed that under his influence, Messier 
was made a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences.
<p>
Finally, in 1770, he was elected into the Paris 
<i>Acad&eacute;mie Royale des Sciences</i>, 
which he entered on June 30. This occurred about 2 weeks after he had 
discovered another comet, on June 14, which became known as Comet Lexell; 
unusually, this comet was not named for its discoverer, Charles Messier, but 
for the calculator of its orbit, Anders Lexell, a Finnish astronomer and 
mathematician working at St. Petersburg Observatory.
<p>
The same year, on November 26, 1770, Charles Messier, aged 40, married 
Marie-Francoise de Vermauchampt (37). They had known each other from viewing for 
about 15 years.
<p>
On January 10, 1771, Messier independently co-discovered the Great Comet of 
that year.  Three nights after the presentation of the first version of his 
catalog, he measured four more nebulous objects, 
<a href="../../m/m046.html">M46</a>--<a href="../../m/m049.html">M49</a>.
For two of them, however, <a href="../../m/m047.html">M47</a> and 
<a href="../../m/m048.html">M48</a>, he didn't proceed with the usual care, 
and did mistakes in the reduction of positional data, so that they were
<a href="../../missing.html">missed</a> until their 20th century 
identification.
<a href="../../m/m049.html">M49</a> was moreover the first 
<a href="../../more/virgo.html">Virgo Cluster</a> galaxy discovered.
On April 1, he discovered Comet 1771 Messier, his 13th comet in his own 
counting, his 12th independent and his 7th original discovery.
Later this year, on June 7, Messier discovered 
<a href="../../m/m062.html">M62</a>, but only measured an approximate 
position, so he included this "Very Fine Nebula" not before 1779. 
In the same year of 1771, Charles Messier was finally officially made the
"Astronomer of the Navy", and granted a regular salary of 1700 francs annually
(this was raised again in 1774 to 2000 francs). Also this year (in March, 1771)
the <a href="cm_image.html">portrait of Charles Messier</a> displayed at the
top of this page has been created by Desportes.
<p>
On March 15, 1772, Madame Messier gave birth to a son, who was christened 
Antoine-Charles. Following the birth, both Madame Messier and the small boy
died within 11 days, Madame Messier on March 23, and Antoine-Charles on 
March 26, 1772.
<p>
A slightly malicious legend is reported by Jean-Francois de Laharpe, written in 
1801, that the death of Messier's wife had prevented the discovery of another 
comet which would have been his thirteenth, and Messier was more desperate 
because of the lost discovery than of the death of his wife (especially as this 
comet was discovered by Montaigne whom he didn't like). However, this legend 
doesn't stand serious criticism: Montaigne had already discovered this one on 
March 8, a week before Messier's son had been born, and whatever counting is 
appointed, this was not Messier's thirteenth comet (according to Messier's own
counting, as well as a published memoir, and mentioned above, his 13th 
comet had already appeared in 1771).
<p>
Anyway, Messier observed this comet March 26 - April 3, 1772. On April 5, 1772,
he added another cluster to his list, <a href="../../m/m050.html">M50</a>.
Later that year, he took a 3-months vacations in Lorraine, from September 
to November 1772.
<p>
Perhaps partly because of these private experiences, "Nebula" observation was 
apparently reduced by Charles Messier in the years following: 
In 1773, he discovered the second bright companion of the Andromeda "Nebula", 
<a href="../../m/m110.html">M110</a>, but due to unknown reason did not catalog 
it. He discovered one more comet on October 13, 1773; this one was found when 
it was "just visible to the naked eye" (Glyn Jones), or at 4.5 mag (Machholz). 
He found two more objects (<a href="../../m/m051.html">M51</a> and 
<a href="../../m/m052.html">M52</a>) in 1774, and observed Comet 1774 Montaigne. 
Also in the year 1774, <a href="pmechain.html">Pierre M&eacute;chain</a> was 
introduced to Messier by Jerome de Lalande, the leading French astronomer at 
that time; it may well be (according to a conjecture of Owen Gingerich) that 
he had met Messier before this time.
<p>
Until 1777, Messier did not discover another nebula, nor another comet.
In February that year, Messier cataloged <a href="../../m/m053.html">M53</a>
(this globular had been discovered two years earlier by Johann Elert Bode). 
He also contributed to the dubious hypothesis of a planet inside Mercury's 
orbit, when he reported several small bodies crossing the Sun's disk on 
June 17, 1777. He added that the objects observed might be atmospheric 
phenomena, but "more probably small meteorites".
<p>
In 1778 Messier found two more nebulae, the original discovery
<a href="../../m/m054.html">M54</a>, and <a href="../../m/m055.html">M55</a>
which had been reported by <a href="lacaille.html">Lacaille</a>, and which 
Messier had looked for in vain in 1764.
<p>
In 1779, Messier co-discovered Comet 1779 Bode on January 19, 13 days after its
original sighting by Bode on January 6. Following this comet, until May 19, 
he observed six objects 
(<a href="../../m/m056.html">M56</a>--<a href="../../m/m061.html">M61</a>).
There was a modest discovery "outburst" when the comet passed Virgo and the
<a href="../../more/virgo.html">Virgo cluster of Galaxies</a>, and was observed 
by Messier, Johann Gottfried Koehler from Dresden, and Barnabus Oriani in Milan.
Thus Koehler discovered <a href="../../m/m059.html">M59</a> and
<a href="../../m/m060.html">M60</a> on April 11, 1779, but overlooked
<a href="../../m/m058.html">M58</a> which was discovered by Messier when he
independently also found the other two on April 15.
Oriani was the first to identify <a href="../../m/m061.html">M61</a> on May 5, 
1779; Messier found it the same day but took it for the comet on May 5, 6, and 
11 -- he realized its nature as a nebula finally on May 11.
Messier eventually got a good position for <a href="../../m/m062.html">M62</a>
which he had longly discovered in 1771.
<a href="../../m/m063.html">M63</a> was the first discovery of M&eacute;chain
(on June 14, 1779), who had definitely started observing about that time, and
like Messier focussed on comet searching and observing.
In January 1780, Messier found <a href="../../m/m064.html">M64</a> which had 
been discovered previously, in 1779, by Bode.
<p>
Owen Gingerich reports that Messier, by chance, found 
<a href="../../m/m065.html">M65</a> and <a href="../../m/m066.html">M66</a>,
in March 1780; according to Kenneth Glyn Jones, these had been previously 
discovered by M&eacute;chain. Although a comet had passed between these 
galaxies in 1773, Messier had overlooked them, perhaps because the comet had 
outshined them. Also, Messier did not find a 3rd galaxy, NGC 3628, of visual 
magnitude 9.5 (but less surface brightness than the other two), which forms a 
conspicuous triangular group with them: This gives a hint on the modest power 
of his telescopes. In April 1780, he observed two further objects, and thus 
completed his observations for a second version of the 
<a href="m-cat.html">catalog</a> containing the objects up to 
<a href="../../m/m068.html">M68</a>, published 1780 in the French almanac, 
<i>Connaissance des Temps</i>, for 1783.
<p>
Starting in late August 1780, Messier, together with M&eacute;chain, took a 
vigorous effort to catalog more nebulae. By the end of the year 1780, Messier 
had collected the entries up to <a href="../../m/m079.html">M79</a>, and 
discovered a new comet (1780 I Messier, on October 27), shortly after having 
missed another one, 1780II Montaigne-Olbers. By April 1781, the list of 
nebulae and star cluster had increased to 100 objects. Hastily, 3 more objects 
observed by Pierre M&eacute;chain 
(<a href="../../m/m101.html">M101</a>--<a href="../../m/m103.html">M103</a>)
were added without personal validation, to get 
<a href="m-cat.html">the catalog</a> ready for its final publication in the
<i>Connaissance des Temps</i> for 1784 (published 1781). 
Very shortly after publication, on May 11, 1781, Messier added 
<a href="../../m/m104.html">M104</a> to his personal copy of the catalog,
and positions for the hitherto undetermined objects 
<a href="../../m/m102.html">M102</a> and <a href="../../m/m103.html">M103</a>, 
as well as (probably; according to Owen Gingerich) those nebulae mentioned at 
<a href="../../m/m097.html">M97</a> (now <a href="../../m/m108.html">M108</a> 
and <a href="../../m/m109.html">M109</a>). One of M&eacute;chain's discoveries 
of March 1781, <a href="../../m/m105.html">M105</a>, had been overlooked and 
missed the final catalog, and M&eacute;chain discovered a further nebulous 
object, now <a href="../../m/m106.html">M106</a>, in July. M&eacute;chain also 
discovered his first two comets in 1781, on June 28 and October 9.
<p>
Meanwhile, <a href="../similar/herschel.html">
Friedrich Wilhelm (William) Herschel</a>, who was at that time astronomer
(observer and telescope maker) and organist at Bath, England, had discovered 
planet Uranus on March 13. 
Messier got the note in April, and immediately started observing it.
He wrote to Herschel: "It does you the more honor as nothing could be more 
difficult than to recognize it and I cannot concieve how you were able to 
return several times to this star or comet as it was necessary to observe it 
several days in succession to perceive that it had motion, since it had none of
the usual characters of a comet."  He passed his observations to the French 
president de Saron, who was a good mathematician, and was among the first to 
calculate that Uranus was a planet and not a comet, since its perihelion was 
too great (this result was obtained on May 8, 1781). Others, namely Boscovich, 
Lexell, Lalande and M&eacute;chain, obtained the same result, and confirmed 
that Uranus was orbiting the sun beyond Saturn's orbit.
<p>
Later this year, on November 6, Messier's work was unfortunately interrupted
by an awful accident, when he fell into the ice cellar about 25 feet deep.
He was severely injured, and it took more than a year for him to recover;
he was up not until November 9, 1782. 
<p>
In the meantime, in April 1782, M&eacute;chain had discovered another 
"nebula", which finally became the latest discovered Messier object, 
<a href="../../m/m107.html">M107</a>.
<p>
Moreover, in August 1782, stimulated by Messier's catalog, William Herschel, 
assisted by his sister Caroline, began to observe deepsky objects.
Herschel had received a copy on December 7, 1781, from his friend, Dr. William 
Watson, which had been sent to them by Alexander Aubert. 
On September 7, 1782, William Herschel did his first original discovery of 
a deepsky object, the <a href="../ngc/n7009.html">Saturn Nebula (NGC 7009)</a>,
and in October 1783, after some research of efficient observing techniques, he 
began his extensive deep-sky survey of the sky visible from England (i.e., the 
Northern sky), and <a href="../similar/herschel.html">cataloged</a> 1000 
deep-sky objects until 1786, and a total of over 2500 until 1802 (however, 
some of them don't exist, and some others had been discovered earlier). 
<p>
Three days after his recovery on November 9, 1782, Charles Messier observed a 
Mercury transit on November 12, 1782. 
<p>
In 1783, Pierre M&eacute;chain communicated the last 3 objects discovered by him 
(now <a href="../../m/m105.html">M105</a>-<a href="../../m/m107.html">M107</a>) 
to Bernoulli, editor of the <i>Astronomisches Jahrbuch</i>, to include it 
(together with the Messier catalog) in the 1786 edition. In this letter, he 
also disclaims the discovery of <a href="../../m/m102.html">M102</a>, thereby 
initiating a <a href="../../m/m102d.html">still open controversy</a> on the 
identification of this object (i.e., if it duplicates 
<a href="../../m/m101.html">M101</a> as M&eacute;chain claims, or may be 
identified with <a href="../../m/ngc5866.html">NGC 5866</a> which matches his 
description and - up to a reconstructable error in data reduction - Messier's
handwritten position).
<p>
Messier resumed his assiduous observing activities as before, again 
concentrating on comets.  He seems to have used his personal copy of his 
catalog also for a number of years, but apparently did no further attempts to 
find new nebulous objects, and not much work to improve the catalog further.  
This is probably because he knew of Herschel's survey, and as he couldn't 
compete in instrumentation, he lost interest: Perhaps he was aware that future 
comet hunters could use Herschel's compilation also. 
<p>
The <a href="m-cat.html">Messier catalog</a> was finally corrected by 
identifying (at least 3 of) the 4 
<a href="../../missing.html">missing objects</a>, and brought into its current 
state by <a href="../../addition.html">adding</a> the late discoveries of 
Messier and M&eacute;chain,
<a href="../../m/m104.html">M104</a>--<a href="../../m/m109.html">M109</a>,
plus the uncataloged discovery <a href="../../m/m110.html">M110</a>, only in 
the 20th century.
<p>
Messier's comet search led to a further success on January 7, 1785, when he 
discovered comet 1785 I Messier-M&eacute;chain, when it was about 6.5 
magnitudes bright; this one was visible for about 5 weeks. 
M&eacute;chain discovered another comet on March 11, 1785, and a further one on 
January 17, 1786; this was the first aparation of comet Encke, the comet with 
the shortest known orbital period of only about 3.3 years.  
<p>
Messier was appointed as associate editor of the <i>Connaissance des Temps</i>
in 1785, and hold this post for five years until 1790. M&eacute;chain also 
became associate editor one year later, in 1786. Both astronomers continued 
their successful comet search: Messier discovered a new one on November 26, 
1788, while M&eacute;chain found a further comet on April 10, 1787, and 
discovered comet Tuttle when it appeared in 1790, on January 9.
<p>
Meanwhile, the French Revolution had begun with the storming of the Bastille on 
July 14, 1789. 4 years later, this culminated in the "Year of Terror" in France,
1793-1794. That year, the French king Louis XVI was guillotined on January 21, 
and Messier's friend, ex-president de Saron, on April 20, 1794, shortly after 
he had calculated the orbit of Messier's comet discovered on September 27, 
1793, and Messier could notify him secretly that he had found the comet on the 
calculated path. The terrorism ended when finally Robbespierre himself was
guillotined on July 27, 1794.  During that time, Messier lost his salaries and 
pension, and had to loan oil for his lamp from Lalande.  M&eacute;chain was in 
Spain, employed in surveying the meridian, where he discovered another comet in 
January, 1793, but his family lost their estate during this year. He left to 
Italy, and returned to Paris in 1795. He entered the 
<i>Bureau of Longitudes</i> and (together with Messier) the new 
<i>Academy of Sciences</i>.
<p>
Messier discovered another comet on April 12, 1798.

In 1801, when the first asteroid, Ceres, had just been 
discovered by Piazzi on January 1, Charles Messier, now at an age of 71 (shown
at about this time in this image), took 
part in an observing project of occultations of the mag 1 star Spica 
(alpha Virginis) by the Moon, on March 30 and May 24.  
Charles Messier did his last score in comet discovery on July 12, 1801, when he 
independently co-discovered Comet 1801 Pons; this brought the number of 
<a href="m-comets.html">his comet discoveries</a> to 20, 13 being original and
7 independent co-discoveries. 
At that time, he apparently felt the need to comment on his intention for 
compiling his catalog. In the <i>Connaissance des Temps</i> for 1801 he lined
out:
<blockquote>
``What caused me to undertake the catalog was the nebula I discovered above the 
southern horn of Taurus on September 12, 1758, whilst observing the comet of 
that year. This nebula had such a resemblance to a comet in its form and 
brightness that I endeavored to find others, so that astronomers would no more 
confuse these same nebulae with comets just beginning to appear. I observed 
further with suitable refractors for the discovery of comets, and this is the 
purpose I had in mind in compiling the catalog.
<p>
After me, the celebrated Herschel published a catalog of 2000 which he has 
observed. This unveiling the heavens, made with instruments of great aperture,
does not help in the perusal of the sky for faint comets. Thus my object is 
different from his, and I need only nebulae visible in a telescope of two feet
[focal length]. Since the publication of my catalog, I have observed still 
others: I will publish them in the future in the order of right ascension for 
the purpose of making them more easy to recognise and for those searching for
comets to have less uncertainty.''
</blockquote>
As it came out, Messier never carried out this plan.
<p>
Pierre M&eacute;chain lately became director of the Paris Observatory, a post 
he had for several years. But as he had been worrying about some latitude 
determinations in his longitude survey, he finally got Napoleon's permission 
to extend this survey to the Balearic Islands. He left Paris in 1803. After 
completing parts of this work, he caught yellow fever and died in Castillion 
de Plaza, Spain, on September 20, 1804.
<p>
In his older days, Charles Messier finally came to a certain portion of honor 
when Napoleon himself, in 1806, presented him the Cross of the Legion of Honor. 
In turn, the old man Messier ruined much of his scientific reputation by an 
elaborated memoir, devoting the great comet of 1769 to Napoleon, who had been 
born that year; thus he became probably the last serious scientist who claimed 
that comets announce events on earth, or as Admiral Smyth put it: `The last 
comet put astrologically before the public by an orthodox astronomer'.
<p>
In the time following, Messier did less and less observing, although he didn't
completely cease, mainly because he suffered from decreasing eyesight. Thus he 
was unable to determine positions for the two comets of 1805 and that of 1806.
His observatory grew into worse and worse state, with no funds to repair.
The last comet Messier reports to have seen and observed, the positions 
measured with the help of other observers, was the "Great Comet" of 1807.
<p>
In 1815, Messier suffered a stroke which left him partially paralyzed. After
partial recovery, he attended one or two more academy meetings, but his 
everyday life became more and more difficult. 
In the night of April 11-12, 1817, Charles Messier passed away in his 87th 
year, in his home in Paris. He was buried on April 14 on the cemetry of
P&egrave;re Lachaise in Paris.
<p>
Charles Messier has been honored lately by the astronomical community by naming 
a <a href="../m-crater.html">Moon Crater</a> (or even two) after him, situated
on Mare Fecunditatis.
Asteroid 7359, discovered on January 16, 1996 by M. Tichy at Klet Observatory, 
and provisionally designated 1996 BH, was named "Messier"; it had already been 
observed previously, and designated 1978 WR14 and 1989 WT1.
<p>
Already during his lifetime, in 1775, Messier's French fellow astronomer Jerome 
de Lalande had proposed to 
<a href="m-con.html">name a constellation after him</a>, <i>Custos Messium</i>, 
formed of bordering stars of Cepheus, Cassiopeia and Camelopardalis. However, 
this constellation was very short-lived and is now longly extinct.
<p>
Anyway, the most obvious honor is certainly the still common naming of the Deep 
Sky Objects in his catalogue after him, with their "Messier" number, e.g.
Messier 42 or M42 for the Orion Nebula, or M31 for the Andromeda Galaxy.
