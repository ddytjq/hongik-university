<H1>Northern Counties (East) League</H1>
<H2>Founded: 1982</H2>
<P>As part of the establishment of the national non-league pyramid, the
Yorkshire League (founded 1920) and the Midland Counties League (founded 1889)
agreed to merge to form a single feeder league to the Northern Premier League.
Promotion to the NPL was not automatic initially, the NPL feeder league
champions had to apply for election. The lack of automatic promotion and the
amount of travelling involved caused a number of the more southerly clubs to
defect to the Central Midlands League in the hope of establishing a new level of
the pyramid on a par with the NPL. Eventually the CML joined the pyramid as a
feeder league to the NCEL. Automatic promotion between the NCEL and NPL was
finally agreed in 1987, but only after the NCEL lost six clubs to a new division
of the NPL. A number of NCEL champions have since been promoted to the NPL,
although it is rare for a clubs to have to make the reverse journey due to
withdrawals further up the pyramid. In the late 80s the league gained a number
of clubs from the Northern League who were seeking to progress up the pyramid.
The influx ceased in the early 90s when the Northern League finally decided to
join the pyramid as an NPL feeder league.</P>
<P>The Northern Counties (East) League boasts the two oldest football clubs in
the country as members, Hallam FC formed in 1860 and
