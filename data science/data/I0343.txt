This morning (Friday) in the High Court The League was granted an expedited hearing and the case is expected to be heard in July.</P><P>A further damages claim against ITV Digital, its directors and shadow directors is being prepared and will be lodged with the liquidator once appointed.</P><P>The League is also preparing a claim against the ITV Network.</P><P>The League’s media rights have now reverted back to The League and discussions have now commenced with a number of parties regarding the resale of these rights. A further announcement will be made in due course.</P><P>The League has been giving careful consideration to its future structure. In this connection it has held preliminary meetings with senior representatives of Glasgow Celtic and Glasgow Rangers. </P><P>The League recognises that entry for these clubs to the English league cannot occur for the next season. The League believes that the ongoing discussions should involve all interested parties with regard to the restructuring of British professional football in order to protect the variety, range and competition for all clubs, irrespective of size.</P><P>The League hopes that as part of this process discussions will take place with all the regulatory authorities in football. Further announcements will be made as appropriate. </P><P align=justify><STRONG><U>14/05/02</U></STRONG></P><P><FONT color=red><STRONG><U>LEAGUE LAUNCHES LEGAL ACTION AGAINST CARLTON AND GRANADA</U></STRONG></FONT></P><P>The Football League has made a claim for £178.5m against Carlton Communications plc and Granada Media plc – the companies which continue to deny responsibility for payments arising under the League’s contract with their failed subsidiary ITV Digital.</P><P>In the claim filed in the High Court, the League is seeking a declaration that Carlton and Granada are liable as guarantors for future payments totalling £178.5 million plus interest. An application has been made for an early hearing date, due to the severe financial crisis facing the League and its clubs.</P><P>Football League Chief Executive David Burns said: <I>"<FONT color=red>From the outset of this dispute The Football League has made it abundantly clear that it will, if necessary, use all options to pursue Carlton and Granada for monies outstanding from our broadcasting agreement.</FONT></P><P>"<FONT color=red>The Football League has sought to negotiate with Charles Allen and Michael Green but they have refused to meet with us and, in view of their unwillingness to enter into a meaningful business discussion, we are now focussed on the legal process. Leading counsel has advised that the League has a strong case on the merits and we remain confident of success."</FONT></P></I><P>The Football League is also preparing a claim against the ITV Network, as it asserts that ITV Digital and the ITV Network (at the direction of Carlton and Granada) have acted in partnership to exploit the League’s media rights. </P><P>In view of Carlton and Granada’s actions the League has now accepted that ITV Digital’s failure has brought their contract to an end. Consequently, the League has now taken back all media rights granted under that contract. This leaves a claim for damages, exceeding £500 million, which will be lodged with the liquidator of ITV Digital, once appointed.</P><P>The League will also call on the liquidator to undertake a detailed investigation into the collapse of ITV Digital and the actions of those most closely concerned, including their Directors and Officers, Carlton, Granada and the ITV Network.</P><P>The League has commenced discussions with prospective partners concerning the sale of its broadcasting rights for the Nationwide Football League, Worthington Cup and LDV Vans Trophy. All interested parties will be invited to tender.</P><P>David Burns added: <I>"<FONT color=red>The failure of ITV Digital should not distract people from recognising that The Football League remains a hugely popular and exciting sporting programme. More people attend our games than any other competition in Europe and this season we have enjoyed our best attendances for 33 years, with over 15 million people going through the turnstiles.</FONT></P><P><FONT color=red>"The enduring attraction of football to television viewers cannot be questioned, this Sunday alone 7 million people watched the Division One Play-off Final between Birmingham City and Norwich City, its highest television audience ever."</FONT></P></I><P><STRONG><U>30.04.02</U></STRONG></P><P><STRONG><U><FONT color=red>STATEMENT FROM THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE</FONT><BR><BR></U></STRONG>The Football League has been advised by the ITV Network that the ITV Sport Channel is to become a digital free-to-air service, from the afternoon of 1st May 2002.</P><P>The League is pleased that this will allow fans to see the remaining scheduled-for-broadcast play-off games, live on television.</P><P>We believe this action signifies an understanding by ITV and its shareholders of the importance and value of sport to television viewers.<BR><BR><STRONG><U>25.04.02</U></STRONG></P><P><FONT color=red><STRONG><U>LEAGUE ATTENDANCES HIT 33-YEAR HIGH</U></STRONG></FONT></P><P>Attendances in the Nationwide Football League have hit their highest level for 33 years.</P><P>Almost 14.8 million people went through the turnstiles in Divisions One, Two and Three during the course of the 2001/2002 regular season, an increase of 9% on last year.</P><P>These figures mark the highest aggregate attendance since the 1968/69 season when 14,797,321 attended games in the lower three divisions of English football.</P><P>This year’s figure stands at 14,791,689 and cements The Football League’s place as the most watched league competition in Europe.</P><P>Division One alone has attracted almost 8.5million supporters, its highest aggregate since 1959, while crowds in Division Two have risen by more than14% on last season and Division Three crowds are at their highest since 1971, with almost 2.5 million people flocking to the stands.</P><P>John Nagle, The Football League’s Head of Communications said: "These figures demonstrate the enduring appeal of professional football at all levels of the game. They are even more remarkable when one considers that under 11 million people watched our games in the first season after the formation of the Premier League in 1992/3.</P><P>"Our 72 clubs have worked tirelessly to strengthen links with their local communities and to market themselves more innovatively than ever before. These figures are clear evidence that these efforts are now beginning to bear fruit, as is the fact that this year’s Worthington Cup recorded the highest average attendance for 20 years and the LDV Vans Trophy saw gates rise by over 20%."</P><P></FONT><STRONG><U>23.04.02<BR></U></STRONG><STRONG><U><FONT color=red><BR>RESPONSE TO STATEMENT BY ADMINISTRATORS OF CARLTON’S AND GRANADA’S DIGITAL PLATFORM<BR></FONT><BR></U></STRONG>The Administrators of the digital platform owned by Carlton and Granada made a statement late yesterday. The further response of The Football League is as follows:</P><P>1. The administrators said they ‘are now in discussions with the ITC about an accelerated process <I>leading </I>to a sale as a going concern’. The administrators have not yet said the business <I>is</I> up for sale.</P><P>2. Carlton and Granada have a combined market worth of some £5.2 billion. They can afford to honour their obligations but, in respect of the creditors of their wholly-owned digital platform, have so far shown no concrete signs of doing so.</P><P>3. The Government is to provide Carlton and Granada with some £2,000,000,000 (£2 billion) of taxpayers money over the next ten years by way of rebate for broadcasting over digital platforms. We call upon the Government to state that it will review this rebate in the event that these companies abandon ITV Digital.</P><P>4. The Football League remains ready, willing and able to resume negotiations following a constructive meeting with Carlton, Granada and the Administrators last Friday, 19 April.</P><P>5. In the absence of a fair and reasonable settlement of amounts outstanding to The Football League, then legal action will be taken by The Football League.<BR><BR><STRONG><U>19.04.02</U></STRONG></P><P><STRONG><U><FONT color=red>WIMBLEDON APPLICATION REFERRED TO FA COMMISSION</FONT><BR><BR></U></STRONG>The Football League Board of Directors has decided that Wimbledon FC’s application to relocate to Milton Keynes should be referred to a Football Association Commission.</P><P>David Burns, Chief Executive of The Football League, explained: "Wimbledon’s application to relocate to Milton Keynes raises fundamental issues relating to the way football in this country is organised. The potential ramifications for clubs, players and fans at all levels of the football pyramid, including not only Football League clubs, but also clubs above and below The Football League, are significant.</P><P>"Therefore, to ensure that the focus of the inquiry is sufficiently broad and all-inclusive, and that the views of all interested parties are taken into account, the Board has taken the decision to refer the matter to an FA Commission.</P><P>"The Football League will cooperate in full with the Commission, including making submissions to it <FONT face=Arial size=2>regarding the issues raised by Wimbledon’s application." </P><P></FONT><STRONG><U>8&nbsp;April 2002 </U></STRONG></P><P><STRONG><U><FONT color=red>LEAGUE SUCCESSFUL IN COURT ACTION</FONT><BR><BR></U></STRONG>The Football League ("The League") has today applied successfully for disclosure of documents and information relating to the Administration of ITV Digital. The League asked for this information on 3 April, but the request was refused.</P><P>The League believes it would not have been possible to properly assess its position as a major creditor of ITV Digital without this additional information. The League was also concerned that Deloitte & Touche chose to withhold this information when the Administration was applied for on 27 March.</P><P>David Burns, Chief Executive of The League said:</P><P>"We will now have a level playing field for all creditors rather than full information only being available to Carlton Communications and Granada. </P><P>"Despite today's events, The League remains ready, willing and able to open a dialogue with Carlton Communications and Granada to seek a just resolution to this situation.</P><P>"It should not be forgotten that Carlton Communications and Granada can and ought to pay the contract in full. We all now know that the £178.5 million owed represents less than 10% of the recent £2 billion rise in the value of these companies due to ITV Digital being placed into administration".<BR><BR><STRONG><U>02.04.02</U></STRONG></P><P><STRONG><U><FONT color=red>STATEMENT REGARDING ITS MEDIA RIGHTS AND ITV DIGITAL</FONT><BR><BR></U></STRONG>The Football League has today held a meeting together with senior executives and Chairmen of Division One clubs.</P><P>The meeting resolved unanimously the following:</P><P>The Board of The Football League will continue to engage Carlton Communications and Granada to secure a settlement of the current dispute. This would involve an assurance that the £89.25m due to The Football League in August this year will be paid. We are prepared to discuss the method for the payment of the final tranche of £89.25m in conjunction with the future of our media rights.</P><P>In the absence of such a settlement, The Football League will commence proceedings against Carlton Communications and Granada for the amounts owed plus damages and costs. The claims would be expected to be in the region of £500m.</P><P>If the ITV Sport Channel is closed down, The Football League will consider a number of options for licensing its product – the most popular football league in Europe – to other media platforms over the medium term.

This is not a football specific problem.</P><P align=justify></P><P align=justify>"The suggestion, made by this report, that football should be responsible for the costs of policing the public, away from football grounds is unjust.
