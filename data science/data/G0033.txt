<h2>I. THEORETICAL RESEARCH</h2></a>


<p>

<h3> Galaxy Dynamics</h3>

<p>Buta and F. Combes (Paris Observatory) carried out detailed numerical
simulations of three resonance ring galaxies: NGC 1433, NGC 3081, and
NGC 6300. Buta reduced detailed optical H-alpha interferometry of NGC
1433 obtained in collaboration with S. Ryder (UKIRT) and of NGC 6300
obtained in collaboration with G. Madsen (U. Wisconsin).
Combined with published HI data, these observations provided
well-defined rotation curves for these galaxies. Using H-band images,
the gravitational potentials in the three galaxies were derived and a
cloud-particle disk was evolved in this potential in response to the
nonaxisymmetric components. The method was used to derive the pattern
speeds in the three galaxies by matching cloud-particle distributions
to the gaseous and young star morphologies of the galaxies.</p>

<p>In a theoretical study of the hot gas in elliptical galaxies M.
Loewenstein (U Maryland & NASA/GSFC) & White assessed how the gas
could be observed to be systematically hotter than the dynamical
temperature of the visible stars. D. Davis (MIT) and White previously
proposed that the dark matter in ellipticals must be dynamically hotter
than the visible stars (see below).  Loewenstein and White performed
detailed numerical  hydrodynamical and stellar dynamical calculations
and confirmed that the observed disparity in gaseous and stellar
temperatures in ellipticals implies that dark matter is indeed
dynamically hotter than the stellar component.</p>

<p>Byrd worked with undergraduates D. Ousley, C. Dalla Piazza, and
graduate student D. Domingue to develop a quantitative model
for the inner and two outer rings of NGC3081.  Here the ring shapes
permit a calculation of the perturbation potential even in the outer
disk. Use of the perturbation with disk photometry permits
determination of disk surface density, mass/light ratios, and halo/disk
ratios.  A preliminary calculation for NGC 3081 beyond the outer rings
(4 exponential scale lengths) indicates substantial dark matter in the
disk with a comparatively small amount of the mass in any spherical
halo. Byrd, Ousley, and T. Freeman (Bevill State)  used their
analytic/computer model to demonstrate that the resonance rings in
NGC3081 can serve as star formation laboratories for the study of time
changes in stellar associations after their formation. The difference
in the orbital angular speed and the bar pattern speed serve to
separate associations in position angle around the ring according to
their age since formation near the ends of the bar.  The observed color
variation qualitatively matches expectations subject to expected
problems of contamination by the light of old disk stars.  This model
was also used to study the one-armed spiral galaxy, NGC 4622.
Previously, Byrd, Freeman, and Howard (NSF) found that the single
leading arm in the inner disk can be created by tidal effects of a
small companion.  Byrd and   Freeman have subsequently found that the
ring in NGC4622 is an <i>m=1</i> resonance feature of dissipative periodic
orbits of gas clouds.  This represents an additional type of resonance
ring which should preferentially be the long term result of close
passages by small companions.</p>

<p>Models for explaining nuclear activity in disk galaxies (such as
Seyfert or Markarian galaxies) range from intrinsic (e.g. bars) to
external (tidal perturbation by passing companions). Byrd and
collaborators have followed up their work in the late 80's to explore
possible links between perturbations and nuclear activity. Their
simulations show a several 10^8 yr  delay in the appearance of
activity after perturbation and a similar duration which can explain
the equivocal observational evidence.  Byrd and Valtonen (Turku)
predict from the tidal hypothesis that: 1) there should be an excess of
pairs where both components are active, 2) nuclear activity will be
preferentially excluded in pairs which are unequal and favorably
distributed in pairs where the members are equal, 3) smaller pair
members can induce activity if they are equal in size than if they are
very unequal and 4) pairs where one or both members are active should
have a smaller velocity difference times separation normal.  These
predictions are borne out in observations of Markarian galaxies.</p>

<p>Graduate student R. Mohr (advisor G. Byrd) is studying the
gravitational effects of M31 on its smaller companion M32 using
computer codes developed by B. Smith (NASA Ames) and R. Miller (U.
Chicago).  Mohr has also simulated the gravitational effect of the
giant association NGC206 on the disk of M31. Finally, Mohr is
investigating via simulations the origin of filaments found near giant
ellipticals in the cores of galaxy clusters and near non-cluster
ellipticals.  Mohr finds that tidal disruption and inelastic collision
of the disk gas clouds can produce narrow, dust rich and comparatively
massive filaments near the E-galaxies.</p>


<h3> Magnetohydrodynamics</h3>

<p>Hardee's work involves study of the dynamics and emission from the
highly collimated jet outflows observed in extragalactic radio sources,
quasars, galactic superluminals, and protostellar outflows.  The work
includes analytical analysis of the magnetohydrodynamic fluid
equations, numerical simulation and modeling of the dynamics and the
emission from the jets and comparison with observations of individual
objects. In this work relativistic and non-relativistic adiabatic and
radiatively cooling magnetized jets are studied and modeled.
Analytical theory is used to establish model dependence on parameters
and for its predictive abilities.  The numerical simulations are used
to study non-linear processes, e.g., mass entrainment and mixing of jet
material with the external environment, and to study applicability of
the analytical theory.   Modeling work is of particular importance to
extragalactic jets or to the galactic jets where the continuum nature
of synchrotron or inverse Compton emission provides no direct measure
of velocity, density and magnetic field strength, and whose observed
apparent motions may reflect a wave pattern or shock speed different
from the speed of the underlying flow.  Protostellar outflows where
line emission serves as a velocity indicator, will allow exploration of
the relationship between line emission, entrainment, boundary layer
velocity shear and shock structures, and the underlying outflow
dynamics. Objectives of this research are (1) to learn how analytical
theory with input from numerical simulations can be applied to these
objects, (2) to directly apply three dimensional numerical simulations
to understanding the outflow dynamics of these objects, (3) to use the
results to learn how outflow morphology is influenced by the external
environment, by the presence of dynamically significant magnetic
fields, and by radiative cooling, and (4) to model the emission from
jets and understand the relationship between observed emission and the
underlying flow.</p>

<p>Rosen continued the ongoing analysis of simulation data.  Studies of
the differences between non-relativistic and relativistic jets where
performed. Additional work involved analysis of simulations designed to
study the effect of magnetic fields on mass entrainment and mixing of
an ambient medium with magnetized jet material. Jet toroidal
equipartition magnetic fields are found to significantly decrease the
rate of mixing between jet and ambient fluid. Poloidal magnetic fields
of comparable strength do not provide a similar reduction in mixing.
The difference is largely the result of a suppression of jet
filamentation by the toroidal magnetic fields.  The rate of mixing is
found to be related to the growth of surface structures associated with
the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.  In the sub-Alfvenic very strong
magnetic field regime mixing of jet and ambient fluids is almost
entirely suppressed.  This suppression coincides with suppression of
the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.  However, at the Alfven point the jet
becomes very unstable and significant mixing and mass entrainment are
found to occur for both poloidal and helical magnetic field
configurations.  This result has serious implications for jet
acceleration and collimation schemes requiring jet acceleration from
sub-Alfvenic through the Alfven point to super-Alfvenic speeds.</p>

<p>Hardee continued his collaborative effort with J. Stone (U. Maryland)
through analysis of numerical studies on the effect of magnetic fields
on the dynamics of radiatively cooling protostellar jets.   This work
has involved numerical and theoretical study of the effects of
radiative cooling on the dynamics and stability properties of 3D
protostellar jets. Hardee served as co-advisor for J. Xu (U. Maryland)
who completed his dissertation in June 1998 on 3D simulations of
protostellar jets. In addition to this work Hardee also performed a
theoretical analysis of the bending effect of magnetic fields in the
ISM on protostellar jet outflows.  This theoretical work was
incorporated into a simulation study of jet bending by magnetic fields
performed by J. Hurka and J. Schmidt Burgk (MP-Radioastronomie-Bonn).
It was found that the observed deflection of some stellar jet outflows
probably cannot be the result of interaction with magnetic fields in
the ISM as the magnetic fields would have to be too high.  On the other
hand, a low speed wind outflow could be deflected by moderate ambient
magnetic fields.  A 2D ram pressure theoretical treatment was found to
satisfactorily represent the jet bending observed in the numerical
simulations.</p>

<h2>III. OBSERVATIONAL RESEARCH</h2></a>
<p>
<h3>Normal Galaxies</h3>

<p> G. Purcell completed his dissertation study (advisor: R. Buta) of the
photometric and kinematic properties of a sample of "Milky Way
Galaxies", a set of galaxies chosen to be similar in Hubble type and
likely morphology to the Milky Way. Purcell analyzed optical <i>BI</i>
images and H-alpha Fabry-Perot interferometry of 27 galaxies near
stage Sbc covering the full range of families (barred versus nonbarred)
and varieties (inner-ringed versus non-inner-ringed). The main
objective of Purcell's study was to determine what physical factors
underlie the spread in morphologies at a given Hubble type along the
Hubble sequence by measuring photometric profiles and rotation curves
of these 27 galaxies. The stage Sbc was chosen because galaxies still
cover the full range of families and varieties at this stage, there is
significant diffuse H-alpha emission in the disks for kinematic
coverage, and the galaxies provide a well-defined comparison sample for
Galactic studies. Purcell's thesis represents the first attempt to
apply the Canzian geometric method for estimating pattern speeds in
galactic disks to a significant, homogeneously-observed sample of
galaxies. With this method, Purcell determined that the inner rings in
several of his sample galaxies extend to corotation, and that the outer
Lindblad resonance lies within the area covered by the outer spiral
arms.</p>

<p>White and D. Davis (MIT) compiled and analyzed the first X-ray complete
sample of elliptical galaxies.  The X-ray emission from these
ellipticals is dominated by gas, presumably accumulated stellar mass
loss, with cooling times much less than a Hubble time; the gas is
therefore slumping radially inward in subsonic "cooling flows," since
it is radiating its pressure support.  Temperatures, elemental
abundances and X-ray luminosities were determined from ROSAT spectra of
43 ellipticals.  They found that the X-ray emitting gas in these
galaxies is generally hotter than the dynamical temperature of the
stars (as indicated by stellar velocity dispersions).  They also found
very subsolar elemental abundances in the X-ray emitting gas, so
supernovae energy input (and metal contamination) must be negligible.
They therefore proposed that the gas is hotter than the stars because
the cooling flow gas is traversing dark matter halo potentials which
are characterized by larger velocity dispersions than in the associated
stellar components.  Thus, the dark matter is dynamically hotter than
the stars.</p>

<h3> Dwarf Galaxies</h3>

<p>Graduate student S. Gessner Stewart completed a dissertation (advisor
G. Byrd) using images of dwarf galaxies obtained on the Astro2 mission
aboard <i>Endeavour</i>. She processed  Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope
(UIT) data for Holmberg II, Sextans A and IC 2574 to characterize the
star formation process in these intrinsically simple systems. This work
centered on a test for the origins  of HI holes in the ISM of these
systems, which have been interpreted as the result of energy input from
star-forming regions.  UV data offer the potential to find young stars
long after they cease to contain ionizing OB stars, and indeed the UIT
images show young associations in the centers of many H I holes.
Gessner Stewart estimated their ages and energy output, and found these
to be comparable to the estimated ages of the expanding holes and the
energy required to create them, which supports an origin from energy
input by previous generations of star formation.</i>

<p>Eskridge & White
analysed archival ROSAT PSPC and Einstein HRI data for an X-ray point
source in the bar of NGC 6822, the nearest dwarf irregular beyond the
Galactic halo.  The source is spectrally very soft and strongly X-ray
variable.  Spectral uncertainty allows the source to be interpreted
either as Super-Soft source or as a black hole binary candidate.</p>

<h3> Resonance Ring Galaxies</h3>

<p>Buta continued his studies of resonance ring galaxies via observations
and numerical simulations. With graduate student G. Purcell, Buta
carried out a detailed photometric and kinematic study of the
well-known Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 3081, a classic resonance ring galaxy
with four well-defined ring features.  The galaxy has a bright nuclear
ring, an intense inner ring, and a characteristic double outer
ring/pseudoring structure, all of which are easily linked to specific
orbital resonances with the bar.  All four rings are sites of active
star formation, and there is little star formation away from the rings.
Buta and Purcell determined that the that the shape, size, and
orientation of the inner ring are the same in B, I, H-alpha, and
H passbands, implying a close coupling between the stellar and
gaseous rings. The H-band image was used by Buta and Purcell to
derive the gravitational potential in NGC 3081, using codes written by
A. Quillen. From this analysis, Buta and Purcell determined the maximum
relative amplitude of the bar and the bar pattern speed.</p>

<p>In a similar study, Buta, Purcell, D. A. Crocker, and REU students A.
Alpert and M. Cobb carried out photometric and kinematic analyses of
four other classic early-type resonance ring galaxies: NGC 1326, IC
4290, ESO 509-98, and ESO 566-24. Using H-band images to derive
the gravitational potentials, and assuming outer rings and pseudorings
in the outer regions of each galaxy are linked to the outer Lindblad
resonance, these authors estimated pattern speeds and showed that the
inner rings are likely to be linked to the inner 4:1 resonance in these
galaxies. Optical rotation curves of ringed galaxies were shown to be
relatively normal, and that dark matter is required to account for the
nearly flat rotation profiles at large radii just as for nonringed
galaxies.</p>

<p>Buta, Purcell, and J. Higdon (U. Groningen) carried out a detailed
optical and HI study of the interacting ringed barred spiral NGC 5850.
VLA observations showed that the HI in NGC 5850 follows the optical
blue light spiral structure very closely and shows the same kind of
asymmetry. The asymmetry is likely to be due to an interaction with the
nearby giant elliptical galaxy NGC 5846, and the authors propose that
NGC 5850 is a victim of a high speed encounter with this object. The
degree of asymmetry of NGC 5850 depends on the wavelength, being much
less significant in the I-band than in B or H-alpha, indicating
that the gas disk is more disturbed than the stellar disk.</p>

<p>With H. Salo, P. Rautiainen, and E. Laurikainen (U. Oulu), and Purcell,
Crocker, and Cobb, Buta carried out a detailed observational and
dynamical study of the multi-ringed southern galaxy IC 4214. IC 4214
has only a weak bar and three strong rings: an inner, outer, and a
nuclear ring. Fabry-Perot interferometry reveals the presence of
diffuse ionized gas in the region of the bar, inner ring, and nuclear
ring, and clear noncircular motions are detected in this region.
Analysis of the velocity field under the assumption of pure circular
motion gives a value of the inclination which differs by 10 degrees
from the inclination inferred from outer isophote shapes.  Using
two-dimensional sticky particle simulations, this discrepancy is
easily accounted for by the effect of the noncircular motions. The
simulations led to an accurate estimate of the pattern speed in IC 4214
and showed that all three rings can be linked to standard orbit
resonances. The simulations also showed that the visible mass dominates
over the unseen halo mass over the main part of the visible disk.</p>

<p>Buta, Crocker, and G. Byrd obtained HST time to observe the detailed
structure in the bright nuclear rings in two barred spirals. Nuclear
rings are often the sites of starbursts in barred galaxies, and have
been linked to the dynamics of an inner Lindblad resonance. The two
rings observed are in ESO 565-11 and NGC 1326. The former object has
the largest known example of a nuclear ring. From multi-band HST WFPC2
images, Buta, Crocker, and Byrd showed that the nuclear ring of ESO
565-11 is lined by more than 700 point sources, the brightest of
which are "super star clusters" of the type seen in other nuclear
rings and in merging systems. The clusters are mostly in the age range
4-6 Myr, although some are old enough to have red supergiants
detectable in the H-band. An analysis of the gravitational potential
inferred from an H-band image suggests that the nuclear ring is
related to an inner Lindblad resonance and is in an early phase of
development. The data for the nuclear ring of NGC 1326 are currently
being analyzed by Buta and graduate student P. Treuthardt.</p>

<p>Buta, Treuthardt, and former REU student Madsen are engaged in analysis
of optical images of a large sample of ringed galaxies. The goals of
the analysis are to derive accurate orientation parameters to allow
approximate deprojection of the galaxies, an evaluation of the
alignments between bars and rings, and also to derive the average
light profiles, disk, and bulge properties of these galaxies. The
analysis has so far verified much of what was learned from statistical
studies of the projected shapes, position angles, and relative sizes
of rings, and has revealed interesting characteristics of individual
ringed galaxies.</p>

<h3>Galaxy Opacity Studies</h3>

<p>Keel and White continued their use of overlapping galaxies to measure the
dust extinction within spirals. They have analyzed a set of new HST WFPC2 
of elliptical/spiral overlaps specifically to measure the fine-scale dust
structure. At a resolution of order 50 pc, the dust behaves very much like
a screen with typical Galactic reddening law. They find scale-free 
(fractal-like) behavior in the extinction maps over a range of about 1.5 dex
in scale. The arm-interarm distinction is more pronounced than seen from
the ground, with what earlier appeared as interarm dust sometimes now
appearing as discrete spurs crossing between arms.</p>

<p>HST imaging of the spectacular spiral/spiral superposition NGC 3314
offers a unique opportunity to measure the opacity in the inner parts
of an Sc galaxy. These data indicate that the dust in some of the arms
has a larger scale height than the stars. Seeing the nucleus of the
background galaxy within 2" of the foreground nucleus (300 parsecs)
gives a direct estimate of the extinction at this small radius, about
A(I)=4 magnitudes between the dust arms.</p>

<p>Keel, White and graduate student D. Domingue used spectroscopy to
measure the extinction in spiral/spiral pairs, with the redshift
difference allowing a separation of foreground and background light in
the overlapping regions. This technique requires less precise symmetry
than their purely image-based approach. The results of this study tell
the same story as the earlier imaging survey -- spiral arms can have
large optical depth at almost any radius, while interarm regions have a
roughly exponential radial distribution of opacity, reaching A(B)=1
only well inside 0.4R(25). Keel and White have been extending work
on backlit galaxies to the near-infrared bands, in collaboration with
P. Eskridge, K. Sellgren, and D. Terndrup (OSU).  This work uses the
large-format TIFKAM system at the 2.4m Hiltner telescope of MDM
Observatory. Domingue, Keel, White, and S. Ryder (JAC Hilo) combined
opacity measures with ISO and JCMT far-IR and submillimeter
measurements to limit the role of very opaque or very cold dust in
three backlit spirals. Adopting an empirical exponential model for the
dust distributions allow an estimate of total dust mass from the
absorption measures, which agrees with the thermally emitting grain
mass calculated from Galactic grain mixes at the 30% level. Thus
suggests that we are now seeing most of the grain mass in typical
spirals, with little role for either extensive cold dust or small,
opaque clumps.</p>

<p>Keel has developed an algorithm to retrieve the three-dimensional
distribution of dust in galactic nuclei from images in multiple
passbands, solving an integral equation for the amount of starlight in
front of and behind dust structures. Tests show that it retrieves
planar disks in such systems as NGC 4261. Further application to HST
archival images will be used to investigate that apparently large
<i>z</i>-extent of dust features, to see what level of energy input and
plausible mechanisms are required to keep these features so far from
the inner disk plane. This approach may also shed light on the
difference in dust environments between Seyfert 1 and 2 nuclei reported
by Malkan and collaborators.</i>

<h3>Zone of Avoidance Studies</h3>

<p>Buta and M. McCall (York U.) completed a detailed photometric study of
14 members of the IC 342/Maffei Group, a nearby small group of galaxies
located in the Zone of Avoidance in the Perseus-Cassiopeia border
region. The group includes some of the most massive galaxies within 5
Mpc of the Local Group, but has been poorly studied because of the
heavy foreground Galactic extinction and star contamination of several
of its members. The group includes the nearest massive elliptical
galaxy, Maffei 1, the giant Scd spiral IC 342, and the very heavily
obscured massive late-type spirals Maffei 2 and Dwingeloo 1. Buta and
McCall derived accurate total V- and I-band magnitudes of these and
10 other mostly dwarf members of the group, to set the stage for
deriving distances and to evaluate what impact, if any, this group may
have had on Local Group history.</p>


<h3>Active Galactic Nuclei</h3>

<p>Sulentic continues a collaboration with P. Marziani and M. Calvani
(Padova), D. Dultzin-Hacyan (UNAM) and T. Zwitter (U. Ljubljana) on
broad emission line properties of AGN. This work involves comparison of
high and low ionization lines using HST archival UV and matching ground
based optical spectra. This comparative study has focussed on H-beta
and CIV 1549 which are the most tractable broad lines for a
comparison in sources with z<1.0. A new sample of about 50 sources
is being prepared for publication and will bring the total sample with
matching H-beta and CIV to about 100. The new sample so far confirms
the main results reported in 1996: 1) radio-loud (RL) and quiet (RQ)
sources show significantly different broad line properties and 2) the
high (HIL) and low (LIL) ionization lines in RQ sources are also
significantly different; favoring models where the two lines arise from
different BLR clouds. The most striking result involves an apparently
ubiquitous blueshift (relative to the local rest frame) of CIV (and
other HIL) in RQ sources. This is most easily explained if CIV is
produced in an accretion disk wind whose far side component is obscured
by the optically thick disk. CIV shows a range of blueshifts from zero
to 5000 km/s suggesting that the amplitude of the shift depends upon
source orientation. The systematic blueshift disappears in RL sources
and is replaced by small stochastically distributed red and blue shifts
about the rest frame.  H-beta in RL sources shows an average redshift
but with large blue and redshifts (up to  4-5000 km/s. This
emission is most easily explained if the line arises in a biconical
outflow where an optically thin disk allows us to see both red and
blueshifted clouds.</p>

<p>Sulentic and Marziani have investigated the apparent confusion over the
frequency and amplitude of the CIV blueshift in the literature.  They
find that the shift is muted or erased in samples where no narrow line
components is subtracted from CIV. Confusion over this component arises
because a) the UV NLR lines are expected to be heavily reddened and b)
the narrow component of the UV lines is usually broader than the narrow
lines observed in the optical (e.g. [OIII] 5007). Marziani and
Sulentic find that the narrow component of CIV shows properties similar
to the narrower NLR lines including lack of intensity variations and no
line shifts. They ran simple models using CLOUDY that show broader NLR
emission lines arising naturally near the inner edge of the NLR where
the density is higher. They conclude that there is no strong
justification for treating it as BLR gas and that failure to correct
for its presence leads to erroneous conclusions about the basic
properties of the broad lines.</p>

<p>Working with Keel and P. Allan (Rutherford Appleton Lab. UK), graduate
student J. Castro-Ceron finished his master's thesis on the variability
of PG quasars. He found that the structure functions of the most and
least luminous objects are essentially identical, arguing that previous
claims to the contrary were misled by neglect of the transformation
into the objects' emitted time frames.  There is some evidence that
objects with relatively stronger X-ray emission are more strongly
variable, while there is essentially no trend with absolute magnitude.</p>


<h3>Galaxy Evolution</h3>


<p>Keel continued studies of the rich environment of the radio galaxy
53W002 at <i>z=2.4</i>, working with R. Windhorst and his group at Arizona
State. Imaging at the KPNO 4m telescope using medium-bandwidth filters
identified additional Lyman-alpha emission candidates in a structure
7 arcminutes (about 5 Mpc) across, of which three have now been 
spectroscopically confirmed as AGN at this redshift. This grouping
is more extended than a King distribution (of any core radius), and
its velocity dispersion is comparable to the Hubble flow across its
diameter at this early epoch. These data, plus the relative isolation
of the structure, suggest that we are seeing it close to turnaround from
the general Hubble expansion.</p>
 
<p>They studied the nature of the faint star-forming objects previously
detected in this field, using NICMOS and IRTF data to measure the
emitted-optical regime. These results are a close fit to low-metallicity
starbursts, changing the interpretation from preliminary data of much 
lower S/N ratio. ISO data at 7 microns (emitted K band) are still
being processed, in hopes of either a mean flux detection or significant
limits on the older stars in these objects.</p>

<p>Wu is completing his Ph.D. dissertation on the history of galaxy
merging and formation timescales, extending his modelling code to the
near-IR passbands. He has used new counts from deep NICMOS and IRTF
imagery in the 53W002 field as constraints, explicitly accounting for
surface-brightness selection effects.</p>

<p>Pursuing the comparison of deep-UV properties of nearby galaxies with
those observed for high-redshift systems, Keel was a coinvestigator on
the Starlite payload carried on STS-95 (P.I. Jay Holberg, University of
Arizona).  This consists of a 0.4m SiC primary mirror feeding a
double-pass spectrograph to suppress geocoronal Lyman-alpha
emission. A failure in one of the mount bearings meant that they could
not improve on the Voyager measurement of M33, but surveys of several
1-degree regions were carried out, as well as a long strip scan
enabled by a specially altered orbiter attitude during one of the final
orbits. Reflight of the system (with a dedicated far-UV imager) has
been proposed.</p>

<h3>Groups and Clusters of Galaxies</h3>

<p>Davis & White used spatially resolved ROSAT X-ray spectroscopy to
look for evidence of a recent merger in the radio halo cluster
Abell 2255.  Cluster radio halos are thought to be associated with recent
cluster mergers, with mergers driving shocks which create
a pool of relativistic particles, which then radiate via
synchrotron radiation. Davis & White find that Abell 2255 indeed
has relatively hot patches associated with the radio halo,
supporting the merger origin for radio halos.</p>

<p>Graduate student R. Dupke completed a dissertation (advisor R. White)
that involved spatially resolved X-ray spectral analysis of
intracluster gas. In particular, Dupke used elemental abundance
gradients to constrain the metal enrichment mechanisms in intracluster
gas.  Possible enrichment mechanisms include galactic winds,
ram-pressure stripping of galactic gas by intracluster gas and, at the
centers of cD clusters, stellar mass loss from the cDs.  Dupke
discovered and/or confirmed that abundances are centrally enhanced in
several clusters.  More importantly, spatial gradients in abundance
<i>ratios</i> were discovered in several clusters, which implies that the
dominant metal enrichment mechanism is different near the cluster
centers than in their outer parts.  Using an ensemble of abundance
ratios, the proportion of iron due to SN Ia (as opposed to SN II) was
found to be 50% in the bulk of the clusters, increasing to
75% at their centers. Dupke & White showed that ram pressure
stripping cannot be the dominant enrichment mechanism anywhere in these
clusters.  They proposed instead a two stage wind scenario to account
for intracluster metal enrichment: a SN II-driven protogalactic wind
phase, followed by a less energetic SN Ia-driven wind phase.  Dupke
also used X-ray spectroscopy of intracluster gas to constrain
theoretical models for SN Ia explosions.  He showed that so-called
"delayed-detonation" models do not produce the Ni/Fe ratios observed
in the SN Ia component of enrichment in intracluster gas, while the
nucleosynthetic yields of older "convective-deflagration" numerical
models are consistent with the cluster observations.  Dupke & K.
Arnaud (U. Maryland, NASA/GSFC) used the results of Dupke & White on
SN Ia enrichment in clusters to show that the resonant scattering of
the Fe K line alleged to occur in the Perseus cluster by Molendi et al
is more likely an artifact of a blend with Ni lines, due to SN Ia
ejecta.</p>

<p>With P. Godon (STScI) and N. Soker (Technion, Israel), White proposed a
couple of magnetic amplification mechanisms which may operate in
cluster cooling flows which are rotationally supported.  The twisting
of magnetic flux tubes and the operation of a fast alpha-omega
dynamo will both promote magnetic reconnection, driving activity in the
inner 10 kpc of cooling flows and possibly powering the optical
filaments seen in the central regions.</p>

<p>Andersen completed his Ph.D. dissertation (advisor W. Keel) on star
formation in the nearby clusters of galaxies Hercules (Abell 2151) and
Abell 1367. These spiral-rich clusters are sometimes taken as analogues
to higher-redshift Butcher-Oemler clusters, but only recently have
large-format CCDs made complete studies of their populations feasible.
Using broadband and H-alpha data from KPNO and Lowell, Andersen found
that the relation between star formation and cluster location is not as
simple as infall models would suggest. Most of the blue galaxies must
be blue for long periods (rather than briefly bursting), since there
are too few objects of intermediate color to accommodate a fading
population that would accompany such starbursts. Hercules also contains
a population of compact emission-line galaxies, some hitherto
uncatalogued.</p>

<p>Working with Owen (NRAO), Ledlow (UNM), and Andersen, Keel continued
work on the rich cluster Abell 2125 at <i>z=0.25</i>. This cluster attracted
attention through a combination of richness, blue fraction, and an
extraordinary radio-source population. The radio sources and galaxy
distribution have been attributed to a cluster merger. They have
obtained multiobject spectra and HST imagery to clarify the nature of
the radio sources and the cluster dynamics.  Some parts of the cluster
contain discrete, compact galaxy aggregates, some so compact that their
constituents were undercounted in ground-based data. The radio galaxies
include traditional red, elliptical systems and spirals; there is
morphological evidence that some AGN seen very close to the cD core
have been tidally disrupted by either the general cluster field orthe
triple cD galaxy itself.</i>

<h3> Interacting Galaxies</h3>

<p>D. Domingue is completing a dissertation project (advisor J. Sulentic)
on the star formation properties of 20 mixed morphology galaxy pairs.
The data includes ISOCAM, ISOPHT and matching H-alpha images.
Isolated E/S0+S/I pairs provide a unique opportunity to study the
gravitational effects of a massive perturber on the gas and dust
content of a spiral disk. This is the only kind of binary galaxy where
one can unambiguously search for evidence of cross-fueling between the
components.  All of the pairs show self-consistent structure in the
ISOCAM LW3, LW8 and H-alpha images which provides a general
confirmation that warm dust is heated most in sites of star formation.
There is no evidence for a decrease in the 11.3/15 micron ratio with
equivalent width excess, as was seen for extreme starburst knots in the
Antennae.  The NGC 7752/3 system is of particular interest because the
companion shows an unusually high gas mass and dynamical models point
to evidence for a continuous fueling of the companion from the spiral
disk of the more massive component. A comparative morphology of
H-alpha and ISOCAM images indicates that the two strongest mid-IR
`hotspots' are giant HII regions at
the edge of spiral arms involved in disk-wide star formation. The
companion with the largest H-alpha equivalent width in our sample
shows a warmer 60/100 H-alpha emission color than NGC 7753 the
dominant spiral.

<p>Keel and Borne (Raytheon) have obtained WFPC2 images of the interacting
pairs NGC 6621/2 and NGC 5754/Arp 297C. These were selected as especially
good nearby examples of weak advanced interactions (NGC 5754) and of
strong but still young interactions (NGC 6621), to see whether and when
massive star clusters form during these kinds of interactions (neither
of which has been well probed by the pairs studies to date). NGC 6621 in
particular is rich in luminous clusters, and shows helical dust structure
suggesting mass transfer to the earlier-type companion.</p> 

<p>Sulentic is studying star formation activity in the compact group known
as Stephan's Quintet (SQ). Multiwavelength data and collaborators
include:  1) ISOCAM and ISOPHOT and matching H-alpha images with C. Xu
(IPAC) and R.  Tuffs (M.P. Kernphysik), 2) ROSAT HRI with G. Trinchieri
(Brera) and W. Pietsch (M.P.E. Garching) and 3) H-alpha Fabry Perot
images with M. Rosado and D. Dultzin-Hacyan (UNAM). Overall the star
formation activity is depressed with the two strongest IR sources
involved with athe foreground galaxy NGC7320 and the Seyfert 2 nucleus
of NGC7319. If SQ is typical of compact groups then the earlier claim
that IRAS data overestimates the level of star formation in compact
groups is confirmed. An unusual starburst was found in the tidal debris
of SQ with an estimated star formation rate of 0.8 solar masses/yr and a
burst age of 1-2 times 10^7 years. This is consistent with the age
of the X-ray shock that is associated with an ongoing collision in SQ.</p>

<p>Sulentic with Marziani, M. D'Onofrio (Padova) and D. Dultzin-Hacyan
have investigated the close pair of spiral galaxies known as UGC3995.
This pair shows apparently interacting disks and a zero velocity
difference. This appeared to be an excellent candidate pair for
investigating possible cross fuelling that might have given rise to the
Seyfert nucleus in the brighter component. Older images suggested a
luminous filament connecting the nuclei. Unfortunately new images
(including archival WFPC2) and spectra reveal little evidence that the
spirals are interacting thus illustrating the difficult in proving
interaction even when circumstances (i.e. proximity and relative
velocity) appear to favor it. The overlapping and near face-on spiral
patterns are so well defined that it was possible to estimate the
opacity of the foreground companion. The visual extinction was found to
vary from 0.15 magnitudes in intra-arm regions to 1.0-1.5 magnitudes in
the arms.</p>

<p>Sulentic was co-advisor for H. Toledo (UNAM) who completed a
dissertation in November 1998 on the optical and FIR emission
properties of mixed morphology pairs of galaxies. This work found
evidence for both optical and FIR enhancement in the spiral components
of mixed pairs. The level of enhancement appears to be similar to that
found for samples of more common spiral-spiral pairs. This suggests
that mass of a perturber is more important, in most cases, that the
presence and relative orientation of a disk component in the
perturber.  The FIR results show the largest enhancement signal at
25 microns. This aspect could not be studied in previous surveys because
the IRAS 25-micron detection fraction was too small. Toledo used
coaddition and deconvolution techniques to both increase the detection
fraction in his sample of about 130 pairs and to resolve the components
in a few cases.</p>

<h2>IV. OTHER ACTIVITIES</h2></a>


<h3>Equipment</h3>

<p>
The astronomy group uses a network of 11 Sun and three Silicon Graphics
workstations. Through these machines there is access to several 600 dpi
B/W Postscript printers, both high and low density 8mm tape drives, 4mm
DAT drives, a 1/2-inch high-density tape drive and a color Postscript
printer. The computer network shares a capacity of approximately 13Gbytes
of group-accessible disk space as well as another 18 Gbytes of reserved
disk space. All the major astronomical software reduction packages are
supported and several IDL licenses are available.  The new SRC
Equatorial Sky Survey and Palomar II survey have been acquired and are
gradually moving towards completion. An extensive collection of data
has been collected on CDRoms, including the digitized sky survey (north
and south).</p>

<h3>Education</h3>

<p>Keel prepared a slide set and explanatory booklet on quasars and active
galactic nuclei for distribution by the Astronomical Society of the
Pacific. The contents may be viewed 
<a href="http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/agn"> here</a>.

<p>Driven by the simultaneous growth of local light pollution and interest
both in courses and among the public, the group has acquired a 0.4m
Newtonian telescope which will be sited at nearby Moundville
Archaeological Park. </p>

<h3>Other</h3>

<p>UA physicist R. Tipping and collaborators are involved in NASA
sponsored theoretical molecular physics research. Their work on
spectral line shapes is important for the analysis of planetary
spectroscopic data. It is particularly relevant for radiation emitted
in spectral windows between the strong vibration-rotation bands where
the absorption is saturated.  Collision-induced absorption dominates
the FIR spectra of the outer planets, brown dwarfs and newly discovered
"methane stars".</p>

<p>Graduate student A. Johnson (advisor P. Hardee) is currently working
in cooperation with NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center to study BATSE
trigger biases.  Johnson has written computer algorithms to quantify
separately the Peak Counts Bias, which arises from statistical
fluctuations, and the Slow Riser Bias, which results from burst flux
being included in the on-board background calculation.  Johnson, with
supervisor C. Meegan (NASA/MSFC) and collaborator J. Hakkila 
(Mankato State University, Minnesota) is currently working to simulate
the action of both biases acting on a burst.</p>
<p> Buta spent 1 month during the summer of 1998 as a visiting astronomer
at the Paris Observatory. During this visit he collaborated with Dr.
F.  Combes on numerical simulations of ringed disk galaxies using a
sticky particle dynamics code and other programs. The results were
presented at the meeting, "Galaxy Dynamics: From the Early Universe to
the Present", held in Paris in July 1999. Buta also presented an
invited (keynote) review on "Resonance Rings and Galaxy Morphology"
at the meeting "Towards a New Millennium in Galaxy Morphology", held
in Johannesburg, South Africa in September 1999. This review
supplements and updates the more thorough review on the subject
published in Fundamentals of Cosmic Physics, vol. 17, p. 95, 1996.</p>

<p>Byrd spent 01-06/99 on a sabbatical visit to Tuorla Observatory (Turku,
Finland).  While there with collaborators A. Chernin (Moscow State
University, Russia), I. Karachentsev (Special Astrophysical
Observatory, Russia) and M. Valtonen (Tuorla), he completed a review on
triple galaxies for <i> Fundamentals of Cosmic Physics</i>. Byrd also
served on the scientific and local organizing committees of IAU
Colloquium 174 (Small Galaxy Groups) held in Turku, Finland in June
1999.</p>

<p>Hardee was on sabbatical at U.  Michigan and STScI during part of the
9/98-6/99 period. He was in residence at NRAO (Socorro) during part of
summer '99. Results of some of this work were presented at the Texas
Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics (Paris)held in December '98.
Other related work was presented by C. Smith (graduate student at the
U. Michigan) at the AAS meeting in January 1999. Additional work was
presented by Hardee at the "Lifecycles of Radio Galaxies" workshop
held at STScI in July 1999.</p>

<p>Sulentic, Marziani and Dultzin-Hacyan completed a review titled "The
Phenomenology of Broad Emission Lines in AGN" for the 2000 edition of
<i>Annual Reviews of Astronomy and Astrophysics</i>. Sulentic was a
visiting scientist at Osservatorio Astronomico di Padova from
6/99-8/99. He presented the invited review "Stephan's Quintet:
Implications for Compact Groups" at IAU Colloquium 174 (Small
Galaxy Groups) in June 1999, Turku, Finland.</p>
