    campaigner Skybeau was retired from racing recently. Being a tough stayer he missed out
    the accolades afforded other members of his foal crop of 1992 but was a clear favourite
    with the racing public most notably for his five successive runs in the Melbourne Cup.
    Only a virus in the weeks leading up to the 2001 event prevented him joining Shadow King
    for the record number of starts in the race of six.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Skybeau was sired by Dahar who stood for five years in New Zealand but
    failed to grab the headlines as a sire despite producing 10 stakeswinners including Group
    1 winners Daacha, Stony Bay and Des's Dream. Beaumont Babe was a stakeswinner who won 13
    races from 1050m to 1600m but her most well known victory would the Listed Great Western
    the race that precedes the Melbourne Cup each year. At stud she has produced 10 foals with
    her first being Bar Dancer in 1987. Bar Dancer raced 45 times for 4 wins and 15 placings
    ending his career over hurdles. 1988 foal Natchez started 39 times for 4 wins and 14
    placings before retiring to stud. A filly called Sajama followed before Beaumont Babe was
    sent to Dahar to produce Bay Tram in 1990. Bay Tram was a consistant stayer recording 7
    wins and 7 placings from 37 starts. A second trip to Dahar resulted in Mandoma a duel
    winner in a short career. In 1992 Beaumont Babe produced Skybeau, a member of Dahar's
    final local crop, on November 18.</font></p>
    <p><img src="skybeau121096.jpg" alt="skybeau121096.jpg (23499 bytes)" align="right" border="2" hspace="10" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="268"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">After the late foaling
    Beaumont Babe was not served til the follwing year producing the 1994 filly Classy Babe
    who won 3 races from 22 starts with 4 placings before heading to stud. A colt called Mr
    Logic was born in 1995 and another colt called Golden Danabeu now just starting a career
    in Singapore was born in 1998. Beaumont Babe's latest progeny is a 2yo un-named filly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">The 1992 Dahar-Beaumont Babe colt that was
    to become Skybeau was offered for sale at the New Zealand Premier Yearling Sale in early
    1994 by Waikato Stud and was sold for $17,500. He entered the stable of Len Smith at
    Cheltenham for owners MM Smith, A Grayling, AJ Eastgate, EM Potter and TJ &amp; RJ McLeay.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Skybeau was first produced at the early
    spring barrier trials and finished last of eight behind the talented but ill fated
    Pittsburgh Phil. Three weeks later he improved to be 4 of 7 behind the speedy Padre but
    was sent out for a break to mature. In March he was again tried in a barrier trial and was
    beaten a nose but indicated he was ready to start his racing career. After two unplaced
    efforts over the 1200m at Victoria Park he was tried over the longer journey of 1400m.
    Skybeau duly saluted by three quarters of a length over Gildato and was sent for another
    spell.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Another two unplaced efforts began his 3yo
    campaign but connections saw a future stayer in the gelding and set him for the VRC Derby
    despite the likely presence of two Sydney colts named Nothin Leica Dane and Octagonal.
    After running third at Morphettville over 1500m he returned to tackle the 1800m winning
    easily by 1 ¾ lengths. Two weeks later he stepped up to Listed class to easily beat
    Willpower and Aimbury in the Hill Smith Stakes at Cheltenham. Three weeks later Skybeau
    found himself at Flemington on the first day of the 1995 Cup Carnival. With all the talk
    centred around the Cox Plate winning colt Octagonal and his main rival Nothin Leica Dane
    the South Australian colt was give little hope in the 11 horse field sent out at 40/1. In
    a race marred by interference which saw Skybeau tightened for room and checked near the
    200m Nothin Leica Dane held the late charging Octagonal while Skybeau was finishing hard
    to take a clear fourth placing. While the winner went on to run second in the Melbourne
    Cup Skybeau went for a spell with the Adelaide carnival in mind.</font></p>
    <p><img src="skybeau100597.jpg" alt="skybeau100597.jpg (23398 bytes)" align="left" border="2" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="255"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">First up Skybeau won over the 1600m
    at Victoria Park from Barossa Babe before heading to Melbourne and the Group 2 3yo
    classics. He ran 6th to Iron Horse in the Autumn Classic before a 5th to Scenic Royale and
    Saleous in the Alister Clark Stakes before heading to Sydney. After a promising 5th to
    Peep On The Sly in the Tulloch Stakes Skybeau backed up a week later in the AJC Derby.
    While Octagonal fought out a memorable race with Saintly and Filante with Nothin Leica
    Dane in fourth Skybeau crossed the line 11th at only his second attempt at racing in the
    clockwise direction. Three weeks later Skybeau returned to form in the Rain Lover Plate
    beaten a half neck by older galloper and track specialist Mr Kildaine. After running 5th
    in the SA Derby in course record time for the 2500m Skybeau headed to the Adelaide Cup.
    Sent out at 8/1 the 3yo ran a great race to run second of 19 runners to French Resort
    beaten only 3/4 length with a further 1 ½ lengths back to Gackwar in third place. After
    his first attempt over the 3200m Skybeau was sent for a spell to prepare for the Melbourne
    Cup the following spring.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">After a first up sixth to another crowd
    favourite in Hero Wind Skybeau headed to Melbourne and was 6th in the John F Feehan
    Stakes. He started to strike form as the distances increased and ran second to Toil in the
    JRA Cup before a third under dark forboding skies in the Quick Eze (Herbert Power) Stakes
    at Caulfield. Skybeau was unplaced in the Caulfield Cup before a further unplaced effort
    in the Mackinnon Stakes behind All Our Mob, Filante and Saleous but those runs had topped
    him off for the target race of the spring the Melbourne Cup.</font></p>
    <p><img src="skybeau260497.jpg" alt="skybeau260497.jpg (22150 bytes)" align="right" border="2" hspace="10" WIDTH="299" HEIGHT="261"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Unwanted in betting
    Skybeau was sent out at 50/1 while discussion raged over doubts that Cox Plate winner
    Saintly could run out a strong 3200m and if dour stayers from New Zealand like Count
    Chivas and Senator would bring about his undoing. As it turned out one of the English
    horses set a good tempo in front as Saintly settled perfectly along the rails with Skybeau
    well back. In the straight the race was over with Saintly cruising home from Count Chivas
    but Skybeau was the eyecatcher as he stormed home from back in the pack to finish third
    only a neck behind Count Chivas despite racing a touch greenly in the straight. As Saintly
    headed off on his ill fated mission to Japan Skybeau headed for the spelling paddocks to
    prepare for another tilt at the Adelaide Cup.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">It had also become obvious that Skybeau was
    at his best on dry tracks which continued thoughout his career with all his victories
    being on good tracks and only 3 placings from 20 attempts on slow rated tracks. He started
    his autumn campaign in the Tokyo City Cup at Morphettville running 12th on a dead track.
    Next he was 6th in the TS Carlyon Cup behind Peep On The Sly beaten only a length in a
    blanket finish. Then to Sydney for the Ranvet Stakes and Mercedes Classic but after only
    managing to beat one home in both races those races were the last Sydney siders saw of the
    Skybeau. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Freshened up he was unplaced over 1400m
    before returning to form with a storming victory in the Rain Lover Plate at Victoria Park
    defeating Dark Ksar by a short head with Top Rating a neck away third. Then the rain
    struck the Adelaide Carnival. Despite the dead track Skybeau was sent out as the 22/10F
    for the West End Stakes but couldn't quite match the dash of New Zealander Cronus who won
    by just over three lengths with a similar margin back to Cockade in third, just ahead of
    duel Adelaide Cup winner Our Pompeii. The rain continued and the track was rated slow on
    Adelaide Cup day. Regardless Skybeau was sent out at 25/10 but could only finish fourth
    beaten 4 ½ lengths behind the lightweights in the race Cronus, Lord Ted and Rover.</font></p>
    <p><img src="skybeau080297.jpg" alt="skybeau080297.jpg (20517 bytes)" align="left" border="2" hspace="10" WIDTH="252" HEIGHT="278"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">In the spring Skybeau
    was again dogged by the wet tracks in Adelaide starting his campaign with 2 unplaced runs
    before heading to the Naturalism Stakes at Caulfield. The 2000m journey and the dry track
    was all Skybeau needed to return to his best and won easily from Waterford Road. A fifth
    placing behind Marble Halls in the Turnbull Stakes followed before being unplaced in the
    Caulfield Cup behind Might and Power. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Though unplaced in the Mackinnon Stakes
    Skybeau was ready for his second attempt at the Melbourne Cup. Sent out at 16/1 he was
    never a threat finishing 7th of 22 runners beaten just over 4 lengths in the leader
    dominated race ultimately won by a millimetre by Might &amp; Power from Doriemus. Kept in
    training Skybeau lined up in the Sandown Cup 11days later and struck interference near the
    800m before crossing the line in fifth place on a slow track behind Star Binder. He then
    went for a spell but after having a barrier trial in early February a minor problem saw
    Skybeau miss the rest of the autumn including the Adelaide Cup carnival before returning
    in the spring for a third attempt at the Cup. Unplaced on a slow then dead track at his
    two runs in Adelaide it was back to Melbourne. The big wet continued and followed him to
    Victoria where he was beaten 5 lengths on a dead track in the Turnbull and then 7th on a
    slow track behind Magneto in the Perrier (Herbert Power) Stks.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Next Skybeau tackled the Moonee Valley Gold
    Cup which was being held on the Thursday night under lights for the first time. On a good
    track Skybeau showed a return to form in finishing second to Prince Standaan who led all
    the way to be an upset winner. </font></p>
    <p><img src="skybeau100499.jpg" alt="skybeau100499.jpg (17922 bytes)" border="2" hspace="10" align="right" WIDTH="289" HEIGHT="261"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Plans for the
    Melbourne Cup were back on track and instead of having run on Derby Day Skybeau went
    straight into the big race. His racing style of dropping back early and running on always
    showed that he would need luck in running and as he was moving forward through the field
    he was checked at the 400m. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Though he finished 8th of the 24 runners he
    was only beaten by just over 4 lengths while conceeding weight to the winner Jezabeel and
    runner up Champagne who had won the Mackinnon 3 days earlier. Again he pulled up from the
    run well and was kept in training for the Sandown Cup but again the weather produced a
    slow track and he ran well back.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Skybeau returned to follow a similar path
    to the Adelaide Cup as previous years. Unplaced over the short journey first up he ran on
    nicely over the 1800m at Cheltenham for 5th. Two weeks later Skybeau was back to his best
    charging home to win the Group 3 Birthday Cup by two lengths from Archer Street with
    Kipling about 2 ½ lengths away third. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Then he lost all form. Sent out 9/10 F in
    the Rain Lover Plate Skybeau could only beat one horse home. There was an inquiry into the
    run, he was examined by the vet and swabbed but nothing conclusive was found and he lined
    up two weeks later in the West End Stakes. Again he finished well back in 9th of the 15
    runners and underwent another vet examination. The problem resolved itself by the Adelaide
    Cup though. Under threatening skies the cup was run on a good track and Sheer Kingston
    went to the front in the straight. Suddenly a roar went up from the crowd as Skybeau
    started to charge on the inside of the leader. For a brief moment it seemed Skybeau would
    finally get there in a Cup but it was not to be as Sheer Kingston fought back to hold on
    by just over half a length. Skybeau went for a spell while Sheer Kingston headed to
    Brisbane where he took out the Group 1 Brisbane Cup.</font></p>
    <p><img src="skybeau100499rug.jpg" alt="skybeau100499rug.jpg (15706 bytes)" border="2" hspace="10" align="left" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="228"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">In the spring of 1999
    Skybeau just didn't have his usually zest in racing and finished well back in the Lord
    Mayor Mile (behind the Hayes trained pair Night Sky and Old Tawny), the Naturalism Stakes
    and the Perrier (Herbert Power) Stakes behind Rogan Josh. Skybeau showed a slight return
    to form on a dead track in the Moonee Valley Cup behind future Sydney Cup winner Streak,
    Cronus and Second Coming. His final lead up run was in the Mackinnon where he finished
    well back but fit and well to run in the Melbourne Cup. Skybeau ran his usual honest race
    but after being checked at the 600m and 400m, crucial setbacks to the momentum of a
    backmarker making a long run, he finished 16th of the 24 runners.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">A five month break from racing and Skybeau
    returned to his old form. He was unplaced but beaten only four lengths first up before
    heading to the Birthday Cup. Skybeau looked fantastic in the mounting yard that day and
    strolled out as if he owned Morphettville. He was sent out at 25/1 and dropped out to the
    rear as expected. Turning for home he was still well back and forced to go wide to gain a
    clear run at the leaders. Despite the leaders going strongly inside the final 70m Skybeau
    was flying home down the centre of the track and was always going to win, defeating
    Jamestown by a neck. Undergoing renovations including the construction of the new mounting
    yard in front of the stands the area that was once the front lawns were closed to the
    public though cheering could be heard from up in the grandstand as the old horse hit the
    front close to the line.</font></p>
    <p><img src="skybeau080400rts.jpg" alt="skybeau080400rts.jpg (20384 bytes)" border="2" hspace="10" align="right" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="240"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Skybeau was slowly
    away in the Rain Lover Plate at Victoria Park a week later but on the dead track was a
    fast finishing third after giving away over 6kg to the winner The Bookmaker two lengths
    ahead of Odysseus who held second by a nose. With everything going to plan for the
    Adelaide Cup the weather turned bad and Adelaide experienced its wettest carnival for many
    years. Skybeau again had problems with the rain affected going when well beaten in the
    West End Stakes behind Frenzel Rhomb but continued towards the Cup. The weather had
    improved by Oaks day held on the Wednesday before the Cup and it seemed the weather may
    just hold. Unfortunately it didn't and on Saturday night the rain started then it poured
    down all though Sunday and into Monday morning. The Morphettville track was rated as heavy
    but safe for racing as doubts had been held over the meeting. By race three on the 10 race
    card the intermittent showers started to cause havoc and the track got worse. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">After race 7 an inspection of the track
    deemed it unsafe, the constant rain and four meetings (32 races by this stage) in nine
    days had taken its toll. The Cup was called off but quickly rescheduled for the following
    Saturday at Victoria Park. By Saturday Victoria Park was rated as dead and under sunny
    skies the race took place. Skybeau finished well back with the big wet again denying him
    his chance to finally win a big two miler and it was off to the paddock.</font></p>
    <p><img src="skybeau090900.jpg" alt="skybeau090900.jpg (18107 bytes)" align="left" border="2" hspace="10" WIDTH="269" HEIGHT="249"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">He returned as an 8yo
    to run first up in the Alcohol Go Easy Cup at Morphettville to claim 5th place. It was
    then to Melbourne for an unplaced effort in the Naturalism Stakes at Caulfield before
    heading to Flemington for the Japan Trophy. Despite the humid and overcast conditions the
    track was dry and Skybeau looked well. Coming to the turn he was well back and was pulled
    very wide to make his long searching run. Well into the straight Skybeau still looked a
    chance but couldn't quite pull enough ground off Brew who got there by a long neck from
    ill fated NZer The Warrior with Skybeau ¾ of a length back in third. The wet weather
    returned for the Melbourne carnival and Skybeau was unplaced in both the Herbert Power Hcp
    and the Geelong Cup where he tailed off last but no problem could be found. On a slow
    track he was unplaced behind Brew in the SAAB Quality three days before the Cup but the
    weather improved for the big day.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Skybeau was given little chance of victory
    in the Melbourne Cup sent out at 160/1 though with race fans he was the sentimental
    favourite. Dropping back to the tailenders early he was given the perfect run. Gradually
    making ground from the 2000m Skybeau was poised to strike in company with Yippyio around
    the turn, with both wide but running on. By the 200m Second Coming was in front and
    kicking strongly as Yippyio, Skybeau and the bottomweight Brew started to power home. A
    slight scrimmage between Skybeau, Yippyio and a tiring runner knocked the momentum out of
    Skybeau's run as Yippyio got clear to chase Second Coming. Brew ended up finishing the
    strongest of all to race away in the end and win by 2 lengths from Yippyio with Second
    Coming holding third as Skybeau passed the post 9th but should have finished closer.</font></p>
    <p><img src="skybeau080400after.jpg" alt="skybeau080400after.jpg (20709 bytes)" align="right" border="2" WIDTH="286" HEIGHT="249"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">After a break Skybeau
    returned to win a barrier trial before being unplaced in bunched finish in the Birthday
    Cup. A 6th in the Rain Lover Plate followed before he ran second in the Carlton (West End)
    Stakes after hitting the front at the 200m and just being run down by Apache King. His
    short campaign ended with the Adelaide Cup. Looking to have a far better chance than in
    2000 the race itself brought about his defeat. A very slowly run race with a sprint home
    make it impossible for the backmarkers to have a hope but Skybeau tried his heart out.
    Native Jazz led to the 800m but lost the front as several runners made early moves. In the
    straight Apache King was in front with Native Jazz trying to make ground along the rail
    with Bel Air chasing from Skybeau and Frenzel Rhomb. On the line Apache King was a half
    length in front from Native Jazz with another 2 ¼ lengths to Bel Air third just ahead of
    Frenzel Rhomb and Skybeau. The 3200m was covered in 3.29.70 with the final 600m in 36.77
    on a dead track.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Skybeau returned to training for his 9yo
    season with his spring aim the Melbourne Cup where he would have equalled the record for
    the most starts in the race. First up he was unplaced in the Balaklava Cup where almost
    the entire field of 15 crossed the line within 6 lengths of the winner. Then under 61.5kg
    he made a farewell appearance in South Australia at Victoria Park finishing unplaced
    behind Ama Star. After another unplaced run at Flemington Skybeau finished only four
    lengths from the winner in the Winning Edge (Herbert Power) Stakes a leader dominated race
    won by Freemason.</font></p>
    <p><img src="skybeau210501.jpg" alt="skybeau210501.jpg (18696 bytes)" align="left" border="2" hspace="10" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="233"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Skybeau was then
    entered in both the Geelong Cup and Moonee Valley Cup but was saved for the latter. On
    raceday morning he was amongst the scratchings and his Cup campaign was over. He had
    contracted a virus and headed home.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">It was announced that the Port Cup may be a
    new goal but last week it was decided to retire Skybeau bringing to an end the career of
    South Australia's best but unluckiest stayer of the era.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Skybeau started in the five Melbourne Cups
    and five Adelaide Cups and always ran well and with any luck would have recorded victory
    not just placings over the 3200m.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Connections believe Skybeau would make a
    nice horse for equestrian sports rather than just retiring to a paddock and if and when he
    takes up his new career it will be followed with interest.</font></td>
