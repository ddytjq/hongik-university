<H2><A NAME="Overview">I. OVERVIEW</A> </H2>

<P>
<CENTER><I>We are the first generation of human beings to glimpse
the full sweep of cosmic history, from the universe's fiery origin
in the Big Bang to the silent, stately flight of galaxies through
the intergalactic night. Humankind continues its own journey into
the future with a new depth of understanding and appreciation
for the forces that shape our destiny.<BR>

<H3><A NAME="WICosmo">What Is Cosmology?</A> </H3>

<P>
Cosmologists work to understand how the universe came into being,
why it looks as it does now, and what the future holds. They make
astronomical observations that probe billions of years into the
past, to the edge of the knowable universe. They seek the bases
of scientific understanding, using the tools of modern physics,
and fashion theories that provide unified and testable models
of the evolution of the universe from its creation to the present,
and into the future.
<H3><A NAME="WAtEA">What's All the Excitement About?</A> </H3>

<P>
For 70 years, astronomers have known that the universe is expanding,
that galaxies (gigantic collections of billions of stars) appear
to be flying away from one another. Measurements of the speed
and distance of other galaxies show that the more distant a galaxy
is from the Milky Way (our galaxy), the faster it recedes. This
phenomenon is called the Hubble expansion. Working backwards from
their data, astronomers infer that the universe must have been
created at a definite time, between 8 billion and 15 billion years
ago. 
<P>
In its early stages, the universe must have been enormously dense
and hot-so hot that at one point it consisted mostly of radiation.
As the universe expanded, it cooled. This idea is called the hot
Big Bang model. For decades it remained untested and controversial.
<P>
Over the last three decades, new technologies and ideas have driven
cosmology forward at a rapidly increasing pace. Once a science
of data-starved speculation, cosmology is now a full-blown race
between theory and observations-the hallmark of a vigorous physical
science. This race began in earnest in 1964, when scientists at
Bell Laboratories, while attempting to understand radio antenna
noise, discovered that some of that noise was a signal received
from all directions in outer space. It was soon realized that
this signal might be the cooled-down remnant of the radiation
predicted by the Big Bang model. Cosmology finally had an observational
footholda measurable remnant of the early universe, a probe to
test the various cosmological models. The radiation was dubbed
the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). In 1990, early
data from the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE, pronounced ko-bee)
satellite showed that the CMBR had precisely the profile of intensity
versus frequency to be consistent with the hot Big Bang model
of the universe (see Figure 1). <BR>

</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
In 1992, the COBE satellite produced another remarkable discovery.
Data from a second experiment aboard the satellite showed slight
variations of the CMBR intensity with direction in the sky. The
search for these variations had spanned 25 years. This discovery
caused great excitement among cosmologists, because lumps in the
CMBR are believed to be the ancestors of lumps of matter in our
universe today. Making large surveys of the sky, astronomers are
now able to locate the positions of thousands of galaxies in space
and have found to their surprise that galaxies are far from uniformly
distributed. Enormous sheets of galaxies enclose huge empty voids
and form a structure that resembles a sponge or soap foam. Similarly,
large-scale studies of galaxy motions show that huge regions of
the universe are involved in high-speed bulk motion relative to
the CMBR. The complexity and enormous scale of structure in the
universe surprised cosmologists. But an elegant theory has been
proposed to explain the formation of the recently discovered large-scale
structure. In this theory, puny irregularities in the CMBR, similar
to those detected by the COBE satellite, are amplified over the
eons by gravitational forces to become the lumps and sheets of
matter astronomers see in the universe today. As this theory is
tested by new data, new ideas, and new calculations, cosmologists
may at long last understand, in broad outline, the mechanism for
structure formation in the universe. 
<P>
The details of the statistical properties of the structure expected
in the universe are dependent on the type and quantity of &quot;dark
matter&quot; that dominates the universe. Cosmologists look forward
to another exciting discoverythe identification of this mysterious
dark matter. Over the decades, astronomers have gathered evidence
of unseen mass binding together galaxies and clusters of galaxies,
but the nature of the dark matter still remains a mystery. Is
it something that we already know about, like the stuff that makes
up our Earth and Sun? Or has nature concealed some completely
new kind of matter from our earthbound physics experiments? Theoretical
particle physics offers many exotic candidates, raising the possibility
of not only discovering a major component of the universe but
triggering a new era in particle physics as well. The search is
on, in physics laboratories and at telescopes. A recent development
is the search for dark matter by using its ability to bend light
from distant stars or galaxies (gravitational lensing). Dark matter
in clusters of galaxies and in the halo of our own galaxy is being
studied with this elegant new technique.
<P>
A dream of cosmologists is to be able to make detailed studies
of galaxies at great distances and early times. What did galaxies
look like soon after formation? How do they evolve? When did they
form? With the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and giant (8- to 10-meter)
new ground-based optical telescopes just commissioned and being
built, the astronomical exploration of deep space (astronomers
say &quot;high redshift&quot;) starts now. The repaired Hubble
and the new Keck telescope have racked up major discoveries in
their first few months of operation, leaving no doubt that a new
era is beginning for observational cosmology.
<P>
But what about even earlier, simpler cosmic times, before the
galaxies formed? The CMBR can bring us news from a time when the
universe was only 150,000 years old, or 0.001 percent of its current
age. To find out what happened at even earlier times cosmologists
must rely more on theoretical calculations, based on the physics
we have learned on Earth. Our current understanding of conditions
in the universe penetrates to remarkably early times, because
theoretical predictions of early events have measurable consequences
today. For example, nuclear reactions predicted to occur when
the universe was only about a minute old should have produced
helium, deuterium, and other light elements. The predicted abundances
agree exquisitely with currently measured abundances of these
elements! On less firm ground, but even more amazing, is the idea
that the same CMBR lumps that acted as seeds for the formation
of the large-scale structure can be traced back to quantum fluctuations
occurring in the first billion billion billion billionth of a
second after the Big Bang! If confirmed by measurements now under
way, this knowledge will stand among the major triumphs of human
ingenuity and imagination. 
<P>
These are some of the current research frontiers that challenge
and excite cosmologists. The main body of this report discusses
current work on these issues in more depth. But before that, it
describes some of the key questions that cosmologists are trying
to answer. These give a broader perspective on the long-range
goals of cosmology research. 
<H3><A NAME="CosmoQuestions">The Cosmic Questions</A> </H3>

<P>
If you are unfamiliar with the basic ideas of the Big Bang model,
this might be a good time to read the sidebars-&quot;<A HREF="#CosmicPicture">The Cosmic Picture</A>&quot;
and &quot;<A HREF="#EarlyUniverse">The Early Universe</A>&quot;.
They outline the various epochs of the evolving universe and put
the following discussion into a larger context.
<P>
Spanning enormous ranges of time, space, radiation wavelength,
matter density, and temperature, cosmology research (like most
science) must be subdivided in order to match the scales of human
activity and instrumentation. Individual researchers may work
in a relatively small area of the subject, yet each has in sight
a set of large questions that his or her results might address.
It is the need to find answers to questions like the ones below
that motivates the cosmologist.
<UL>
<LI><I>When did the universe start and how will it end? </I>The
universe is expanding; galaxies are moving apart. Imagine this
process in reverse, like a movie run backwards. The universe would
appear to collapse. So there must have been a time in the past
when the universe was concentrated to high density. This moment
is the origin of the universe, the Big Bang. Measurements indicate
that the universe is between 8 billion and 15 billion years old,
only a few times the age of Earth; intense research is under way
to increase the accuracy of this number. As for the end of the
universe, there are two possibilities: the present expansion may
go on forever, or the universe may stop expanding and come to
a smooth halt, followed by collapse. Determining which will happen
is harder than measuring the age, but there are two ways to do
it: (1) by measuring the average mass density of the universe
and finding out whether there is enough gravitational force to
stop the current expansion (i.e., whether the receding galaxies
have &quot;escape velocity&quot;), or (2) by observing the expansion
velocities of galaxies at greater distances and earlier times
to measure the rate at which the universe is slowing down. Both
methods are being aggressively pursued, and answers are possible
before the end of this decade. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><I>What is the dark matter and what is its cosmological role?</I>
Astronomers have been able to demonstrate that most of the matter
in the universe cannot be observed directly. Dark matter does
not shine like a star, and so astronomers cannot see it. But it
must be present, because astronomers can observe its effect on
other matter that can be seen. The obvious candidate for this
dark matter would be ordinary matter in the form of old, burned-out
stars or stars that are too small to shine (&quot;Jupiters&quot;).
But this idea seems to be ruled out by calculations of the synthesis
of light elements (for example, helium), which occurred when the
universe was between 1&nbsp;and 100 seconds old. As noted above,
these calculations predict abundances that are in good agreement
with the measured abundances of light elements. The agreement
holds, however, only on the assumption that the amount of ordinary
matter present today is small, less than 20 percent of the amount
of dark matter deduced from gravitational effects observed in
today's universe. Something other than ordinary matter must be
present, something quite exotic and revolutionary-new elementary
particles, perhaps, that fit into an attractive theoretical scheme
of things but have not yet been detected on Earth. The dominant
form of matter in our universe is unknown to us! 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><I>How did the large-scale structure of matter form, and how
large is it?</I> When averaged over very large scales, the CMBR
shows that the universe is quite smooth (homogeneous). However,
surveys of galaxies out to just 5 percent of the distance represented
by the CMBR show the universe to be clumpy and uneven (see <A HREF="#Fig2">Figure 2</A>).
How much farther must astronomers go to find smoothness, on average?
Assuming that the homogeneous scale is finally found, what accounts
for the complex structure graded from smooth to rough, and how
did the universe evolve to this state? Cosmologists must rely
heavily on special instrumentation to make very large sky surveys
(encompassing a million galaxies!) to obtain the data to test
theoretical predictions. Those predictions are based on the idea
that feeble variations (&quot;bumps&quot;) in the CMBR show us
the seeds of the structure-formation process. Important data on
the bumps will come from new CMBR maps showing even finer details
than those revealed by the COBE satellite. Understanding the connections
between CMBR bumps and the large-scale structure seen now will
challenge observers and theorists for some time to come.

<LI><I>What can we learn about physical laws from relics of the
Big Bang?</I> When the universe was only about a minute old, the
density and temperature were just right to quickly generate most
of the helium and all of the deuterium present in the universe
today. The remarkable thing is that our physics seems to work
in a time and place so distant from us, a striking confirmation
that physics as we know it can be used to study the early universe,
and vice versa. There are other ways to improve our understanding
of physics using other relics of the Big Bang. A current example
is the effort of elementary-particle physicists to understand
the observed ratio (with a value of 1010) of photons from the
CMBR to hydrogen atoms in the universe. The answer may be found
in elementary-particle theory. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><I>Did the universe undergo inflation at a very early stage?</I>
Despite many successes, the standard, simplest Big Bang model
has serious problems. For example, large regions of the universe
observed today (using the CMBR) were not in causal contact at
the time the early universe was dense enough to settle down to
a uniform temperature. That is, they were not close enough together
to have ever exchanged light signals, or information of any sort.
If the regions were never in causal contact, how did they manage
to reach the same temperature, as indicated by the all-sky CMBR
measurements? Also, why is the density of the universe so close
(within a factor of 10) to the critical density required to stop
the expansion? For the density of the universe to be so close
to the critical density would seem to require extraordinary coincidences
in the values of the cosmological constants in the initial universe.
Such fine tuning of the initial values is necessary to achieve
the delicate balance between the kinetic energy of expansion and
the potential energy of gravity and presents a problem for cosmologists.
Theoretical physicists have proposed a brilliant solution to these
and other cosmological puzzles. A concept called inflation proposes
that the universe went through a huge, rapidly accelerating expansion
at extremely early times (somewhere between 10<SUP>43</SUP> and
10<SUP>32</SUP> seconds). This proposal, which is based in elementary
particle theory, solves the temperature uniformity problem by
expanding a tiny uniform piece of the universe into a region much
larger than the region astronomers can see today (see the sidebars,
<A HREF="#CosmicPicture">&quot;The Cosmic Picture&quot;</A> and
<A HREF="#EarlyUniverse">&quot;The Early Universe&quot;</A>).
Inflation also adjusts the density to precisely the critical value
needed to balance the expansion. Like all worthwhile scientific
theories, the idea of inflation is testable. For example, it predicts
a particular size distribution for the bumps in the CMBR. The
initial results from the COBE satellite are encouraging, but a
worldwide effort is under way to extend those results to smaller
angles where unique signatures of the early universe may be found.
The concepts of inflation and dark matter have revolutionized
modern cosmology.

<FONT SIZE=2>The pie-shaped figure (<A HREF="#CosmicPictureIllustration">The Cosmic Picture</A>) shows a slice of the universe with the present-day Earth at the vertex, looking out and therefore looking back in time. Properties of the nearby universe can be measured directly by telescopes, and so the picture is more accurate near the vertex. Farther out, our knowledge is based less on direct observation and more on calculations and our knowledge of physics. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>An important feature of the universe is that, as astronomers look at galaxies at greater and greater distances, they are seeing farther and farther back in time, because the speed of light is finite and it takes time for light to travel from a distant galaxy to us. Thus, astronomers see galaxies as they were in the past the more distant the galaxy, the younger it was when the light left it, and thus the younger it appears. Labeled on the figure are the ages (measured from the Big Bang) of features as astronomers see them.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Our neighbors in the universe are other galaxies, each consisting of billions of stars. (The Milky Way Galaxy is relatively large, with about 100 billion stars.) Because many galaxies are &quot;nearby&quot; (the great Andromeda Galaxy is only 2 million light years away) and can be seen by the naked eye, they are relatively bright and easy to study. However, astronomers are eager to gather the vast amount of information available from more distant galaxies. This is the primary reason that astronomers want to build larger, more sensitive telescopes and detectors. By looking deeper and deeper into the universe, astronomers hope to witness the birth and aging processes of galaxies, and to study their distribution in space-the large-scale structure of the universe.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Going deeper into the universe, cosmologists imagine a period when stars and galaxies were forming for the first time. The age of the universe when stars and galaxies started to form is uncertain-somewhere between 15 million years and 1 billion years. The first stars and galaxies may have formed quickly, or the process may have been gradual. Cosmologists can only speculate because the data at this depth are so sparse. Paradoxically, cosmologists know more about the universe when it was only 150,000 years old. This early time is explored using the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) that fills the universe. As the universe aged and expanded, the CMBR cooled, ultimately reaching its present temperature of <I>T</I>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.73&nbsp;K (K&nbsp;=&nbsp;degrees kelvin above absolute zero). When the universe was 15&nbsp;million years old, the CMBR had a temperature of about 300 K, which is close to room temperature (radiation temperatures are indicated at var!
ious times in the figure). An important epoch for the universe occurred when the temperature was about 4,000 K (<I>t</I> 150,000 years). At higher temperatures (earlier times) atoms could not have existed because energetic collisions stripped electrons off the nuclei. All matter in the universe was electrically charged, and this charged matter interacted strongly with the CMBR. As the universe cooled below 4,000 K, atoms formed, the matter became neutral, and the radiation-matter interaction ceased to be cosmologically significant. Just slightly before this, gravitational clumping began to prevail over the dispersing tendency of radiation as the radiation cooled and weakened. Gravity pulled matter together to form the first stars, galaxies, and large-scale structure. The seeds for this structure can still be seen as tiny variations (anisotropy) in the intensity of the CMBR across the sky. These are vital clues to the structure formation process, coming from very early times.</!
FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Atoms formed during the epoch of photon decoupling, when the CMBR and matter first stopped interacting strongly. During this epoch, the universe was about a thousand times smaller, a billion times denser, and a thousand times hotter than it is now; it was filled with visible light instead of the microwaves astronomers detect now. (Neutral gas is essentially transparent to light.) Sitting in space during this epoch of the early universe would have been like sitting inside the Sun today the light would have been blindingly bright in all directions.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>Before the epoch of photon decoupling, the CMBR was hotter yet, so hot that it constituted most of the energy in the universe at that time. Labeled the &quot;radiation era&quot; in the figure, this period can be studied by applying known laws of physics and by measuring the intensity of the CMBR at different wavelengths.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>At <I>t</I>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 to 100 seconds after the Big Bang, something remarkable happened (See <A HREF="#EarlyUniverseIllustration">The Early Universe</A>). Calculations show that the temperature (<I>T</I>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 billion K) and density were just right for free protons and neutrons to combine via nuclear reactions, forming helium and other light elements. The calculations use data measured in high-energy and nuclear physics laboratories, and extrapolations of the density and temperature of the universe today. Accurate agreement between the predicted and the measured abundances of these elements is one of the great successes of the Big Bang model.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Going back to even earlier times tests particle physics theories at very high energies. Based on the best theories and observations of relics from this high-energy physics era, particle physicists have outlined a complex picture. The behavior of fundamental forces and elementary particles dominates the processes in this era of extremely high temperatures and densities. Forces merge and unify; particles appear and disappear. Perhaps the most exotic hypothesis posits inflation, a huge, sudden acceleration in the expansion of the universe, driven by a phase transition in a yet unknown field. Here cosmologists encounter the limits of present knowledge. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The edge of the accessible universe is the causal horizon, a spherical boundary centered on Earth with a radius of about 15 billion light-years (the speed of light the age of the universe). Information from beyond the causal horizon cannot reach us because there has not been enough time since the Big Bang for any signal to travel so far, even at the speed of light. But as the universe gets older, the horizon moves out, bringing more of the unseen universe into view. What is the nature of the &quot;stuff&quot; beyond the horizon? Lacking information and an adequate physical theory of the Big Bang itself, cosmologists can only speculate. Observers on a galaxy a billion light-years away from the Earth could draw a similar causal horizon around themselves, but their horizon would include parts of the universe that astronomers on Earth would not be able to see. Given the assumption that observers see a similar universe regardless of where they are, the part that we cal!
l unseen must be similar to the part just inside our horizon. From this argument cosmologists conclude that the part of the universe we can see is embedded in a much larger universe of the same stuff, possibly extending to infinity, or possibly not. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The cosmological picture gets much fuzzier and more speculative as one tries to understand more distant, earlier conditions and events. But cosmology is a young science; most of our data and theories are less than 30 years old. It will be fascinating to see how this picture changes and gets filled in over the next three decades.</FONT>
</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<UL>
<LI><I>Do physics and cosmology offer a plausible description
of creation?</I> As cosmologists and physicists push the boundary
of our understanding of the universe ever closer to its beginning,
one has to wonder whether the creation event itself is explainable
by physics as we know it, or can ever know it. Though such a program
still seems quite fantastic, not so long ago it seemed utterly
unthinkable. A few theoretical physicists have started to work
on the problem. One approach, still highly speculative, is to
consider our entire universe as the result of a tiny quantum fluctuation
in the vacuum. Under the right circumstances such a fluctuation
could expand to scales unimaginably larger than the entire observable
universe. 
</UL>

<P>
Clearly, these questions are at the heart of humankind's quest
to understand our place in the cosmos. They involve some of the
most fundamental unanswered questions of physical science. But
why, in a time of great national needs and budget deficits, should
the U.S. taxpayer support such seemingly impractical research
as that described above?
<H3><A NAME="WhydoResearch">Why Do Research in Cosmology?</A>
</H3>

<P>
In fact, far from being impractical, cosmological research produces
important benefits for the nation and the world. First, it has
unique technical spinoffs. Forefront research in cosmology drives
developments in instrumentation for the collection, manipulation,
and detection of radiation at radio, infrared, visible, ultraviolet,
x-ray, and -ray wavelengths. The understanding and application
of such types of radiation are the foundation for many important
technologies, such as radar, communications, remote sensing, optics,
medical radiology, and many more. Modern astronomical instruments
are usually one-of-a-kind developments pioneered by teams of specialists
who set out to achieve the best possible performance from their
instrumentation. Instrument teams involve astronomers, physicists,
and engineers from observatories, universities, and industry.
This process produces a high return in new ideas, devices, and
methods in the general areas of radiation technology. Some of
these projects are models for effective technology transfer. 
<P>
Another technical driver in cosmology is large-scale computing.
Theorists push the state of the art by demanding the largest,
fastest machines to run programs that model the universe. Such
computer programs, or codes, model the evolution of systems of
millions of gravitationally interacting particles. Codes for following
the hydrodynamics of galaxy formation are the among the largest
such codes in existence. Computers are severely taxed by the gigabytes
of data streaming in from modern astronomical sensors. Indeed,
large cosmological projects are now driving innovative hardware
and software developments. For example, a new sky survey joins
university astronomers with physicists at Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory, the latter contributing their special expertise in,
and computer capability for, high-speed data processing.
<P>
A second benefit of cosmology is its unique ability to probe matter
under extremes of density and temperature that can never be achieved
in laboratories on Earth. The conditions in the early universe
can be used to test physical theories against the measured results
of nature's highest-energy experimentthe Big Bang. Pressures,
temperatures, and densities in the early universe are extremes
beyond our experience, but not beyond our imagination and physical
theories.
<P>
A third reason to pursue cosmology is its tremendous intellectual
appeal. Few areas of the human endeavor excite the human imagination
as much as curiosity about the universe. How did it start? Why
is it here? What is our role? How will it end? Throughout human
history one finds this desire for knowledge about the heavens
and human existence, and virtually all periods of enlightenment
and progress have been times of rapid discovery in astronomy and
physical science. Future generations will look back and evaluate
our era's contributions similarly. 
<P>
Finally, our cosmology-every culture's cosmology-serves as an
ethical foundation stone, rarely acknowledged but vital to the
long-term survival of our culture. Cosmological knowledge affects
religious beliefs, ethical choices, and human behavior, which
in turn have important long-term implications for humanity. For
example, the notion of Earth as a limitless, indestructible home
for humanity is vanishing as we realize that we live on a tiny
spaceship of limited resources in a hostile environment. How can
our species make the best of that? Cosmological time scales also
offer a sobering perspective for viewing human behavior. Nature
seems to be offering us millions, perhaps billions, of years of
habitation on Earth. How can we increase the chances that humans
can survive for a significant fraction of that time? Cosmology
can turn humanity's thoughts outward and forward, to chart the
backdrop against which the possible futures of our species can
be measured. This is not irrelevant knowledge; it is vital.
<H3><A NAME="WhyNow">Why Now?</A> </H3>

<P>
Over the past three decades, cosmologists have built up a base
of knowledge that can now be used to develop new ideas and better
experiments for more exploration. Besides that knowledge base,
a thriving science needs a technology base to open new possibilities
in instrumentation and analysis, and it needs a dedicated, excited
work force. But above all, a scientific revolution needs a subject
rich in undiscovered knowledge. 
<P>
These elements have just now come together for cosmology. A solid
knowledge base has been developed, though it is meager compared
to what is possible. The technology base is superb, and development
is accelerating, especially in the areas of large telescopes and
detectors with high sensitivity and resolution. The ability to
get instruments into space, onto balloons, and to unique sites
like mountain tops and the South Pole has proved to be a boon
for observers. Over the last three decades, the evident possibilities
of the field have attracted more and more young astronomers and
physicists. There now is a new wave of well-trained young cosmologists,
full of ideas and eager to push the field forward. If we recognize
and exploit this unique opportunity, the early 21st century may
witness a revolution in cosmology as exciting as the revolution
in physics that took place in the early 20th century.
<H3><A NAME="Summary">Summary</A> </H3>

<P>
The past 30 years have seen seminal discoveries in cosmology.
The Big Bang model is now established as the best description
of the evolution of our universe. Observed remnants of its early
stages of high density and high temperature offer persuasive evidence
that cosmologists understand, in broad outline, the history of
our evolving universe. Yet urgent questions remain. Cosmologists
have vastly improved their overall understanding of the evolution
of the universe and the formation of structure within it. However,
the age of the universe and its ultimate destiny are still not
known accurately. Cosmologists are uncertain of the timing of
the epoch of galaxy formation and of the details of this complex
process. Many candidates for the ubiquitous dark matter have been
proposed, but none has yet been observed. 
<P>
Cosmology is one of the most exciting disciplines in all of physical
science. The discoveries and insights of the last three decades
have fueled interest and ideas, attracting outstanding young people
to the field. The need for better data has driven major improvements
in technology, especially detectors and telescopes, and the volume
of new data has led cosmologists to press hard on the boundaries
of computation. The combination of basic knowledge, highly motivated
young scientists, and a growing technology base offers an unprecedented
opportunity for further progress. The United States should continue
to be a leader in this fast-moving, exciting area of science.
