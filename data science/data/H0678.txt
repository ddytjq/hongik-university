Biology is complicated; the jargon of the biological sciences is
formidable. In this FAQ I have tried to answer common questions in
simple language for the lay reader. At the same time I have tried also
to provide material in greater depth for the reader who wants
scientific substance. 

<A name=Q1></A>

<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Q: Doesn't evolution depend on mutations and aren't
most mutations harmful?</B></FONT>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>A: No. Most mutations are neither harmful nor
helpful. </B></FONT>

<P>
That's the short answer. The long answer is that mutations can be
neutral (neither helpful nor harmful), strictly harmful, strictly
helpful, or (and this is important) whether they are harmful or
helpful depends on the environment.  Most mutations are either neutral
or their effect depends on the environment.  Let's look at an example
of a mutation which may be harmful or helpful, depending upon
circumstances.

<P>
English peppered moths come in two varieties, light and dark. Before
the industrial revolution dark moths were very rare. During the worst
years of the industrial revolution when the air was very sooty dark
moths became quite common. In recent years, since the major efforts to
improve air quality, the light moths are replacing the dark moths.

<P>
This is a classic example of natural selection; the variations in a
species which are better suited to the environment survive and
reproduce more effectively than those which do not.

<P>
It can be very tricky to determine why some variations better fit
their environments than others. The peppered moth is a good
example. In a famous paper Kettlewell proposed the following
explanation: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Birds eat the kind of moth they can see the best.
  
<P>
In England before the Industrial Revolution trees are often covered
with light colored lichens. As a result light moths were favored
because they were hard to see on the bark of trees whereas the dark
moths were easy to see; birds ate the dark moths. During the worst
years of the Industrial Revolution the air was very sooty so tree bark
was dark because of soot. Dark moths were hard to see whereas the
light moths were easy to see; birds ate the light moths. As a result
the dark moths became common and the light moths became
rare. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Kettlewell's explanation (which makes for an appealing story) has not
stood the test of time. Peppered moths seldom rest on exposed areas of
the trunks of trees. Moreover the distribution of dark moths might not
be well correlated with tree color except in the areas which
Kettlewell studied.  Some more recent studies indicate that peppered
moth melanism is very well correlated with the amount of SO2 (sulfur
dioxide) in the air. <A
href="#note_5">[5]</A>

<P>
None-the-less, before the Industrial Revolution a mutation which
changed light moths into dark moths was an unfavorable (harmful)
mutation whereas during the dark years it was a favorable (helpful)
mutation.

<P>
To see why most mutations are neither harmful nor helpful it helps to
know a bit about what mutations actually are. A mutation is a change
in the genetic material that controls heredity. The genetic material
is contained in chromosomes. Plants and animals have two copies of
each chromosome whereas bacteria only have one copy. Organisms which
have two copies of each chromosomes are called diploids. Those which
only have one copy of each chromosome are called haploids.

<P>
Chromosomes are divided into genes, each gene being a stretch of DNA,
i.e., a sequence of nucleotides (A,G,C,T for short). The location of a
gene is called a locus. <I>(The position of a nucleotide within a gene
is called a site. Don't mix up locus and site.)</I> At a given locus
you may find that the DNA sequence is different from one critter to
another in some small way. These are usually known as different
alleles although sometimes they are confusingly called different
genes. Let's call them different alleles so that we don't get
confused; besides that's the standard term.

<P>
If we look at populations of animals and plants we find that there are
multiple alleles at 10-20% of the genes. In other words if we look at
a given locus in all the members of a population about 10-20% of the
time we will find more than one sequence at that locus. There can be
more than two alleles within a population for a given gene locus.

<P>
Our peppered moths have a gene which controls whether the moth is
light or dark.<A
href="#note_1">[1]</A> Since
moths are diploids each moth has two copies of the gene. If both
copies of a given gene are the same allele then the moth is said to be
homozygous for that gene. If the two copies are different alleles then
the moth is said to be heterozygous for that gene. If both alleles are
the same then the moth will be light or dark, depending on which
allele it has. People sometimes say "which gene it has" but that is
confusing because it mixes up genes and alleles. If a moth has two
different alleles (i.e. if it is heterozygous) then the hue depends on
which allele is dominant. In the case of peppered moths dark is
dominant, i.e., a heterozygote will be dark rather than light.

<P>
Now let's talk about how a gene might change, i.e., how one allele
might change into another. There are a number of ways this might
happen. We might get a point mutation, one nucleotide being replaced
by another. A section might get swapped end for end. A section might
be snipped out. A section might be inserted. Or the entire gene might
be duplicated. See the next <A href="#types">section</A> for a fuller
description of the different kinds of mutations and their effects.

<P>
What is the consequence when one of these things happens? Most of the
time the change either has no perceptible effect at all, or it is
fatal. Coding genes map into proteins using the genetic code. The
genetic code is redundant (the technical term is degenerate), i.e.,
different triplets of nucleotides will produce the same amino
acid. Because of the redundancy a point mutation may have no effect at
all on the protein being coded for; these are known as silent
mutations. If the sequence is altered by snipping or swapping the
result is likely to be fatal because the coding sequence [the readout
in terms of triplets] will be messed up. However this isn't always
true because there are processes that snip and insert sections of DNA
into genes in a way that doesn't mess up the coding sequence.

<P>
Supose we have one of these mutations that isn't fatal but isn't
silent. What happens as a result is that we get a slightly different
protein. Most of the time the new protein works very much the same as
the old protein - it catalyzes the same reactions. Sometimes it's
functional capability changes; it now catalyzes a different
reaction. When this happens there may be another protein which also
handled the original task; in this case we've added a capability. If
there wasn't we lost the original capability and replaced it by a new
one.  Changes in enzymes (proteins that catalyze reactions) are seldom
an all or nothing proposition.<A
href="#note_3">[3]</A>

<P>
Gene duplication is important because it is a way to get new
genes. Once a gene has been duplicated one copy can change while the
other remains the same.


<P>
Genes vary a great deal with respect to how much they can be changed
without the changes harming the organism. Some genes, such as those
that encode the basic metabolism and the components of the
replication, transcription, and translation machinery, are hard to
change without harm. We see very little variation in them from one
organism to another. Such genes are said to be conserved.

<P>
"What is the net result," you may ask. Some mutations are fatal or
very bad.  These mutations get eliminated immediately. Some are silent
and don't count.  Sometimes a mutation is definitely advantageous;
this is rare but it does happen. Almost all mutations which aren't
silent and which aren't eliminated immediately are neither completely
advantageous nor deleterious. The mutation produces a slightly
different protein, and the cell and the living organism work slightly
differently. Whether the mutation is helpful or harmful depends on the
environment; it could be either.

<P>
If you think about it, life has to work this way - mutations (changes
in the genetic material) are happening all the time. The average human
being has about 50-100 mutations, of which about 3 matter, i.e., they
actually change a protein.  If the typical mutation were deleterious
life would go extinct in short order.  <A
href="#note_4">[4]</A>

<P>
Although most mutations are neither uniformly helpful nor harmful they
may be either helpful or harmful in a particular
environment. Environments are always changing, and each member of a
population lives in a slightly different environment from the other
members. Some organisms live; some do not. Some reproduce; some do
not. The alleles of those that live and reproduce get passed on. Any
difference in the organism which is favorable with respect to the
environment will prosper.

<P>
It is important to realize that mutations do not occur in response to
the environment. They simply happen. Quite often a mutation occurs
within a population and then disappears because the organism had no
offspring or didn't happen to pass the mutation on to its offspring;
this can happen even if the mutation is beneficial. Sometimes a
mutation will get established within a population by chance even
though it doesn't offer an advantage; this is known as genetic
drift. <A
href="#note_8">[8]</A>

<P>
It is also important to realize mutations do not happen just
once. They happen rarely but they keep happening over and over again
within a species. In effect a mutation gets more than one bite at the
apple; if it doesn't catch on the first time it appears it gets
another chance.<A
href="#note_9">[9]</A> 

<A NAME="Q2"></A>

<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Q: Are there favorable mutations?</B></FONT>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>A: There are, but it can be hard to tell.</B></FONT>

<P>
For a number of reasons it is not simple to give examples of favorable
mutations. First of all, as we have seen, traits <A
href="#note_6">[6]</A> may be
favorable or unfavorable, depending upon the environment. Secondly it
is not usually known to what extent a trait is genetically fixed and
to what extent it reflects a reaction to the environment. Thirdly we
don't usually know what genes effect which traits. Moreover a mutation
may be favorable in the sense that it permits survival in an
unfavorable environment and yet be unfavorable in a better
environment.

<P>
However there are a number of good examples: 

<P>
<OL>
<LI><I>Antibiotic resistance in bacteria</I>

<P>
In modern times antibiotics, drugs that target specific features of
bacteria, have become very popular.  Bacteria evolve very quickly so
it is not surprising that they have evolved resistance to
antibiotics. As a general thing this involves changing the features
that antibiotics target.

<P>
Commonly, but not always, these mutations decrease the fitness of the
bacteria, i.e., in environments where there are not antibiotics
present, they don't reproduce as quickly as bacteria without the
mutation. This is not always true; some of these mutations do not
involve any loss of fitness. What is more, there are often secondary
mutations that restore fitness.

<P>
Bacteria are easy to study. This is an advantage in evolutionary
studies because we can see evolution happening in the
laboratory. There is a standard experiment in which the experimenter
begins with a single bacterium and lets it reproduce in a controlled
environment. Since bacteria reproduce asexually all of its descendents
are clones. Since reproduction is not perfect mutations happen.  The
experimenter can set the environment so that mutations for a
particular attribute are selected. The experimenter knows both that
the mutation was not present originally and, hence, when it occurred.

<P>
In the wild it is usually impossible to determine when a mutation
occurred.  Usually all we know (and often we do not even know that) is
the current distribution of particular traits.

<P>
The situation with insects and pesticides is similar to that of
bacteria and antibiotics. Pesticides are widely used to kill
insects. In turn the insects quickly evolve in ways to become immune
to the pesticides.

<P>
<LI><I>Bacteria that eat nylon</I>

<P>
Well, no, they don't actually eat nylon; they eat short molecules
(nylon oligomers) found in the waste waters of plants that produce
nylon. They metabolize short nylon oligomers, breaking the nylon
linkages with a couple of related enzymes. Since the bonds involved
aren't found in natural products, the enzymes must have arisen since
the time nylon was invented (around the 1940s). It would appear this
happened by new mutations in that time period.

<P>
These enzymes which break down the nylon oligomers appear to have
arisen by frameshift mutation from some other gene which codes for a
functionally unrelated enzyme. This adaptation has been experimentally
duplicated. In the experiments, non-nylon-metabolizing strains of
Pseudomonas were grown in media with nylon oligomers available as the
primary food source. Within a relatively small number of generations,
they developed these enzyme activities. This would appear to be an
example of documented occurrence of beneficial mutations in the lab.

<P>
<LI><I>Sickle cell resistance to malaria</I>

<P>
The sickle cell allele causes the normally round blood cell to have a
sickle shape. The effect of this allele depends on whether a person
has one or two copies of the allele. It is generally fatal if a person
has two copies. If they have one they have sickle shaped blood cells.

<P>
In general this is an undesirable mutation because the sickle cells
are less efficient than normal cells. In areas where malaria is
prevalent it turns out to be favorable because people with sickle
shaped blood cells are less likely to get malaria from mosquitoes.

<P>
This is an example where a mutation decreases the normal efficiency of
the body (its fitness in one sense) but none-the-less provides a
relative advantage.


<P>
<LI><I>Lactose tolerance</I>

<P>
Lactose intolerance in adult mammals has a clear evolutionary
explanation; the onset of lactose intolerance makes it easy to wean
the young. Human beings, however, have taken up the habit of eating
milk products. This is not universal; it is something that originated
in cultures that kept cattle and goats. In these cultures lactose
tolerance had a strong selective value. In the modern world there is a
strong correlation between lactose tolerance and having ancestors who
lived in cultures that exploited milk as a food.

<P>
It should be understood that it was a matter of chance that the
lactose tolerance mutation appeared in a group where it was
advantageous. It might have been established first by genetic drift
within a group which then discovered that they could use milk. <A
href="#note_9">[9]</A>

<P>
<LI><I>Resistance to atherosclerosis</I>

<P>
Atherosclerosis is principally a disease of the modern age, one
produced by modern diets and modern life-styles.  There is a community
in Italy near Milan (see Appendices II and III for biological details)
whose residents don't get atherosclerosis because of a fortunate
mutation in one of their forebearers. This mutation is particularly
interesting because the person who had the original mutation has been
identified.

<P>
Note that this is a mutation that is favorable in modern times because
(a) people live longer and (b) people have diets and life-styles that
are not like those of our ancestors. In prehistoric times this would
not have been a favorable mutation. Even today we cannot be certain
that this mutation is reproductively favorable, i.e., that people with
this mutation will have more than the average number of
descendents. It is clear, however, that the mutation is personally
advantageous to the individuals having it.

<P>
<LI><I>Immunity to HIV</I>

<P>
HIV infects a number of cell types including T-lymphocytes,
macrophages, dendritic cells and neurons. AIDS occurs when
lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ T cells are killed off, leaving the
patient unable to fight off opportunistic infections. The HIV virus
has to attach to molecules that are expressed on the surface of the
T-cells. One of these molecules is called CD4 (or CD4 receptor);
another is C-C chemokine receptor 5, known variously as CCR5, CCCKR5
and CKR5. Some people carry a mutant allele of the CCR5 gene that
results in lack of expression of this protein on the surface of
T-cells. Homozygous individuals are resistant to HIV infection and
AIDS. The frequency of the mutant allele is quite high in some
populations that have never been exposed to AIDS so it seems likely
that there was prior selection for this allele. (See <A
href="#append_4">Appendix
IV</A>)

<P>
For a description of the recent literature consult the <A
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Omim/dispmim?601373">OMIM
site</A> for CCR5. <A name=types></A>
</OL>


<P>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Types of mutations and their effects</B></FONT>

<P>
Mutations are changes in the genome (genetic constitution). There are
quite a number of ways in which mutations can happen. They also differ
in the way that they impact evolution.

<P>
Mutations which occur when the genome is copied during reproduction
are known as vertical transfer mutations. They are called vertical
transfer mutations because they are transferred from ancestor to
descendent along vertical lines of descent. In the original work on
population genetics it was assumed that all mutations were vertical
transfer mutations.

<P>
Horizontal transfer mutations occur when DNA is moved from one
organism to another. Horizontal transfer can be a major source of
evolutionary novelty. It is important because new genes can be
propagated much more rapidly by horizontal transfer than by vertical
transfer. If evolution is depicted by the tree, vertical genetic
movement is the transmission of genes down branches; horizontal
genetic movement is the transmission of genes between the branches.

<P>
Intra-organism transfer mutations occur when genes or parts of genes
move around within an organism.

<P>
Strictly speaking, hybrids (mating across species) are not mutants. In
many groups of species, particularly among plants, genes are
transferred from to one species to another via hybrids.

<P>
Types of mutations:

<OL>
<LI>Point mutations

<P>
The most common type of copying error is the point mutation. In this
form of mutation the nucleotide at a site is replaced by a different
nucleotide. When people talk about mutation rates they are usually
talking about rates of point mutations.

<P>
<I>Effects of point mutations</I>:
Point mutations in junk DNA are common but have no effect. Sometimes
point mutations in regulatory regions have no effect and sometimes
they alter the expression of some genes.

<P>
<LI>Additions and deletions

<P>
During copying a segment of DNA may be deleted or a new segment may be
inserted. Typically this happens as a result of chromosome breakage or
realignment. (See below.) Additions and deletions can also be produced
by certain types of horizontal transfer.

<P>
<I>Effects of additions and deletions</I>:
If the length of the new or deleted segment is not a multiple of three
the translation will be garbled after the point at which the
insertion/deletion occurred because the frame reading is now
misaligned. This is known as a frameshift mutation.

In some genes there are segments that may be duplicated as a
block. This is known as tandem duplication.

<P>
<LI>Chromosomal duplication

<P>
Sometimes one or more chromosomes are duplicated during reproduction;
the offspring get extra copies of those chromosomes.

<P>
<I>Effects of chromosomal duplication</I>:
Duplicating only one chromosome is generally disadvantageous; an
example in human beings is Down's syndrome. Having multiple copies of
all of the chromosomes is known as polyploidy. Polyploidy is rare in
fungi and animals (although it does occur) and is common in plants. It
has been estimated that 20-50% of all plant species arise as the
result of polyploidy.

<P>
Gene duplication is very common; it is important because it provides a
way to evolve new capabilities while retaining the old
capabilities. All intermediate stages can be found in nature, from a
single gene with alternate alleles to nearly identical duplicated
genes with slightly different functional alleles to gene families of
evolutionarily related genes with different functionalities.

<P><LI>Chromosomal breakage and realignment

<P>
During reproduction a chromosome may break into two pieces or two
chromosomes may be joined together. A section may be moved from one
part of the chromosome to another or may be flipped in orientation
(inverted). This is the mechanism by which deletions, duplications and
transpositions my occur.

<P>
<I>Effects of chromosomal breakage and realignment</I>:

Quite often these types of changes do not affect the viability of the
organism (the genes are still there; they're just in different places)
but, in sexually reproducing species, they may make it less likely for
the organism to produce viable, fertile offspring.

<P>
<LI>Retroviruses

<P>
Certain viruses have the ability to insert a copy of themselves into
the genome of a host. The chemical that make this possible (reverse
transcriptase) is widely used in genetic engineering.

<P>
<I>Effects of retroviruses</I>:

Usually this is a way for the virus to get the host to do the work of
reproducing the virus. Sometimes, however, the inserted gene mutates
and becomes a permanent part of the host organism's genome.  Depending
on the position of the viral DNA in the host genome, genes may be
disrupted or their expression altered. When insertions occur in the
germline of multicellular organisms, they can be passed on vertically.

<P>
<LI>Plasmids

<P>
Plasmids are little pieces of circular DNA that are passed from
bacterium to bacterium. Plasmids can be transferred across species
lines.

<P>
<I>Effects of plasmid transfer</I>:

Plasmid transfer is an important way of spreading useful genes such as
those which confer resistance to antibiotics.  Plasmid transfer is an
example of horizontal transfer.

<P>
<LI>Bacterial DNA exchange

<P>
Bacteria can exchange DNA directly. They often do this in response to
environmental stress.

<P>
<I>Effects of bacterial DNA exchange</I>:

Exchange is often fatal to one or both of the bacteria
involved. Sometimes, however, one or both of the partners acquires
genes which are essential for the current environment.

<P>
<LI>Higher level transfer

<P>
Some parasites can pick up genetic material from one organism and
carry it to the next. This has been observed in fruit flies in the
wild.

<P>
<I>Effects of higher level transfer</I>:

When this happens novel alleles can spread much more rapidly through a
species than they would for ordinary gene flow.

<P>
<LI>Symbiotic transfer

<P>
When two organisms exist in a close symbiotic relationship one may
"steal" genes from the other. The most notable example of this are
mitochondria. In most organisms with mitochondria most of the original
mitochondrial genes have moved from the mitochondria to the nuclear
genome.

<P>
<I>Effects of symbiotic transfer</I>:

A major effect is that the symbiotic relationship changes from being
optional to be obligatory.

<P>
<LI>Transposons

<P>
Transposons are genes that can move from one place in the genome to
another.

<P>
<I>Effects of transposons</I>:

Depending on the position of insertion, transposons can disrupt or
alter the expression of host genes. In some species most mutations due
to transposon insertion. For example, in Drosophila, 50-85% of
mutations are due to transposon insertions. <A name=boxhorn></A>

<BLOCKQUOTE><SMALL> The material in this section is by Joe Boxhorn. It
goes into greater depth than the material in the rest of the FAQ.  It
gives a good picture of how experiments are actually run. It also
gives some examples that aren't usually seen in the popular
literature.  </SMALL></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Experimental work with bacteria, eukaryotic micro-organisms and very
small animals can tell us much about the occurrence and properties of
mutations, including beneficial mutations. Over the last fifty years
or so beneficial mutations have been observed to occur in a number of
studies.

<P>
Most of these experiments were done in a continuous culture system
called a chemostat. Chemostats have been used for the last fifty years
in the study of the physiology, population biology and ecology of
bacteria and a variety of other small organisms. They are also used
widely in the commercial production of microbe produced substances. A
chemostat consists of a bottle in which the organisms grow. Growth
medium (i.e. food) is continuously pumped into the bottle and waste
products, residual medium and organisms flow out. The contents of the
bottle are well mixed so that each critter in the chemostat has an
equal chance of getting at each bit of food. Factors that affect the
growth of the organisms such as temperature are controlled, sometimes
quite rigourously. Several variations of chemostats have been
developed. They will be described as they become relevant.

<P>
Chemostats have several properties that make them useful for
biological research. Over time, the organisms in the system reach a
steady state in which organism growth equals the amount of organism
flowing out of the bottle. At this steady state the concentration of
organisms, measured as biomass, remains quite stable as does the
concentration of residual (unused) nutrient. Numbers can change
somewhat due to changes in the size of individuals. It is important to
note that when the system is in steady state, the critters are growing
exponetially with their growth rate being the dilution rate (in flow
of medium/bottle volume) of the system. The average time an organism
remains in the chemostat is the reciprocal of the dilution rate. These
organisms are also in a steady state physiologically. The population
densities of organisms grown in these continuous culture systems can
be quite high. For a fast growing bacterium like E. coli densities of
3 x 10<SUP>8</SUP> per ml are readily attainable. Similarly small
eukaryotic algae such as Chlorella vulgaris can be easily be grown at
densities of 3 x 10<SUP>7</SUP> per ml. Densities on the order of
10<SUP>5</SUP> - 10<SUP>6</SUP> per ml are attainable for many larger
unicellular and colonial eukaryotes. The implications of this for the
study of mutations are important. Assuming reasonable mutation rates
and genome sizes it is virtually certain that a culture of this sort
that has been run at steady state for any length of time will contain
some mutant individuals. This holds even when the culture is
innoculated with a strain derived from one individual in an obligately
asexual species. If, for example, we assume the following
characteristics for an E. coli chemostat containing identical cells:

<P>
We should see 7.5 X 10<SUP>6</SUP> mutant genes produced in one day. I
would note that E. coli chemostats are generally run at dilution rates
far faster than this.  Another property of this type of system is that
when organisms in a chemostat vary in their growth rates the
proportion of the faster growing forms in the population tends to
increase at the expense of the slower growing ones. Finally, the
mathematical models describing growth of bacteria and unicellular
algae in these systems are reasonably well understood and work fairly
well when compared to data (see, for example, Herbert et al. 1956,
Kubitschek 1970, Pirt 1975).  These models do not do as well
predicting the dynamics when larger organisms with more complicated
life cycles are grown in chemostats.

<P>
A reinterpretation by Kubitschek (1974) of work by Novick and Szilard
(1956) suggests that the argument above was reasonable. In this study
resistance to a bacterial virus was used as a marker to follow the
appearance of some mutations in a chemostat culture. Novick and
Szilard grew E. coli in a chemostat at a steady-state density of about
3 X 10<SUP>8</SUP> cells per ml. Periodically they assayed cells
sampled from the chemostat for resistance to infection by
bacteriophage T5 and calculated the density of T5 resistant cells in
the culture. At no time was phage T5 present in the chemostat nor had
the cells in the chemostat been exposed to phage T5. They found that
there was always a fraction of cells in the culture that was resistant
to T5. The density of resistant cells fluctuated betweeen
10<SUP>2</SUP> and 10<SUP>3</SUP> per ml. It followed a pattern like
the one drawn below:

<P>
(Note: this is not the actual graph. It shows the pattern of changes
that the system went through. For the actual graph see Kubitschek
1974.) The increases and decreases reflect the occurrance of mutations
within strains in the chemostat. The initial increase in the frequency
of resistant cells occurs because a mutation occurs within a T5
resistant strain that makes it (and its descendents) the fastest
growing cells in the culture. As long as this strain remains the
fastest growing one its representation in the population will
increase. Eventually different favorable mutation occurs in a cell
that is sensitive to T5 that makes it (and its descendents) the
fastest growing cells in the culture. This causes the frequency of T5
resistance to decline. Later a different mutation occurs in a T5
resistant strain that makes it the fastest growing strain. Its
frequency increases, and so on.

<P>
It is important to note here that in this environment sensitivity and
resistance to infection by T5 is a neutral trait here. Because there
is no T5 in the environment, resistance does not provide an
advantage. But it doesn't seem to provide much disadvantage either. If
it provided a disadvantage, the resistant cells would washout of the
chemostat. In this environment, it is selectively neutral. Mutations
in other genes cause some cells to have a higher growth rate. It is
just a matter of whether these mutations occur first in resistant or
sensitive cells that determines whether the frequency of T5 resistant
cells increases or decreases. It's a hitchhiking effect - the T5
resistance gene just goes along for the ride with the genes causing
the fluctuations.

<P>
Now in a different environment, the value of the mutation producing
resistance to infection by a virus might have a totally different
value. Chao et al. (1977) grew wild type E. coli B in a
chemostat. Once the vessel reached steady state they innoculated it
with bacteriophage T7. The bacteria are sensitive to infection by
T7. Needless to say, T7 grew like mad on the bacteria.  After a short
time, though, a mutation attributable to a single gene appeared in a
cell surface receptor site which gave tthe bacteria complete
resistance to T7.  This bacterial stain was designated B1. Shortly
after this a mutation occured in the virus which allowed it to infect
strain B1 (strain T7.1). A second mutation occurred in B1 which made
it resistant to this second virus strain as well as to the original
virus strain (strain B2). All five of these critters happily coexisted
in the same chemostat.

<P>
Now whether these mutations were favorable or detrimental depends on
which environment the critters were put in. In an environment
containing T7, E. coli B1 or E. coli B2 could survive while E. coli B
suffered tremendous mortality.  But the mutant strains paid a
cost. They were not as fast at taking up nutrient as the wild type
and, consequently, could not grow as quickly. In competition
experiments in phage-free environments, E. coli B outcompeted every
time. So whether a mutation conferring resistance to T7 is beneficial
depends on:
<OL>
  <LI>whether there is T7 in the environment, and
  <LI>if there isn't, whether sensitive conspecifics are present. 
</OL>

<P>
There has been a considerable amount of work on resistance of bacteria
to bacteriophage that supports this. Some of it is reviewed in Lenski
(1987).

<P>
The presence of a predator in a continuous culture system can place
strong selection upon the critters being grown. When mutations appear
in the prey that confer resistance to predations, they can spread
through the chemostat quite rapidly -- in real time! This has been
seen in many of the studies whose results are reported in the
continuous culture literature.

<P>
Shikano et al. (1990) observed a major morphological change in an
unidentified gram negative bacterium when it was grown in
semicontinuous culture with a predator. Semicontinuous culture is a
culture technique where critters are grown in a mixed
flask. Periodically, a set volume of medium and organism are removed
and replace by fresh medium. This type of system reaches a
pseudosteady state similar to the steady state found in a
chemostat. In this study, an amotile, short (1.5 micrometer)
rod-shaped bacterium was grown with the ciliate predator
Cyclidium. Medium transfers occurred every seventh day.  After 8 to 10
transfers long bacterial cells (up to 20 micrometers) appeared in
cultures which had the ciliate. These cells lacked crosswalls. They
coexisted with a shorter morph. After appearance of the long form, the
density of ciliates in the experimental flasks declined. Feeding
experiments showed that the ciliates fed preferentially on the shorter
cells.

<P>
To test whether the change in the bacterium was a genetic change,
Shikano et al. (1990) examined size distributions of cell in 30
colonies derived from an experimental flask. The frequency
distribution of sizes of the short cells in the the flasks were
indistinguishable from those in the controls and the parental
strain. The frequency distribution of sizes for the long cells was
considerably broader. The fact that daughter colonies derived from
colonies of the long cells show the same distribution of cell lengths
as the long cell colonies from the experimental flasks suggests that
this change in morphology reflects a genetic change.

<P>
Selection for filamentous by a phagotrophic predator seems to be
common with bacteria. Pernthaler et al. (1997) reported the appearance
of a filamentous form of an unidentified member of the
beta-proteobacteria when the predatory flagellate Bodo saltans was
added to a chemostat growing a mixed bacterial assemblage. Similar
filaments have been seen to appear when E. coli is grown in a
chemostat with the predatory flagellate Poterioochromonas malhamensis
(Gillott et al. 1993). Within about 5 days nonseptate filaments as
long as 100 micrometers appeared. Many were so long that the
flagellate could not completely ingest them. (Note: I have done some
feeding study work with this strain. I have videotape of flagellates
trying to engulf a long filament, pushing the filament through itself
until the whole mess looks like a gall on a goldenrod stem and finally
pushing the filament out of itself like an arrow shooting out of a
bow.)  E. coli has been known to produce filaments like this as a
result of exposure to radiaion or chemical agents for a long time
(Deering 1958, Curry and Greenberg 1962, Hoffman and Frank 1963, Adler
and Hardigree 1964). The mechanism appears to be a mutation in
crosswall formation (Begg and Donachie 1985).

<P>
Nakajima and Kurihara (1994) produced a different favorable mutation
in E.  coli. They grew the bacteria in a chemostat with the predatory
ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. Within 15 days of innoculation of the
ciliates, chains of normal-sized E. coli cells appeared. This
morphological change lasted through several platings on agar. Again,
the new form provide protection against predation.

<P>
Van den Ende (1973) introduce the ciliate predator Tetrahymena
pyriformis into a chemostat containing the bacterium Klebsiella
aerogenes growing in steady state. During the period 140 hours to 200
hours following innoculation with the predator, the bacterium's colony
morphology changed from normal mucoid appearance to a glassy
appearance. This reflected a loss of the bacterium's mucoid
capsule. Bacteria began to adhere to the walls of the culture vessel
at this time. No wall growth was seen in the controls. The
morphological change seems to be an adaptation that allows the
bacteria to utilize the wall as a refuge from predation. This is
supported by a change van den Ende saw in the size distribution of the
ciliates. At innoculation the ciliates showed a distribution of
lengths ranging from 40 - 200 micrometers. After 800 hours in the
chemostat, few ciliates exceeded 60 micrometers in length. This
appears to be due to starvation.

<P>
In the above cases, mutations appeared which gave resistance to
predation.  Mutations which confer resistance to parasites have also
been seen in studies of bacteria growing in chemostats. Varon (1979)
introduced the parasitic bacterium Bdellovibrio into a chemostat with
the luminescent bacterium Photobacterium leiognathi growing in steady
state. Within six days a new strain of the host appeared which was
resistant to attack by the parasite. This mutant coexisted in the
culture with a form similar to the original strain. Normally
P. leiognathi grows as pairs of rod-shaped cells and forms translucent
colonies. The mutant strain grows as chains of oval cells and forms
opaque colonies. Plaque assays showed that the efficiency of plating
of Bdellovibrio suspension on lawns of the mutant was at least
10<SUP>7</SUP> times lower than on the original strain or on the
wild-type cells from the culture. Examination of mixed suspension of
parasite and host using phase-contrast microscopy showed that wild
type cells were attacked immediately upon mixing by Bdellovibrio,
while mutant cells remained untouched. Batch-culture studies showed
that under similar culture conditions, the mutant strain has a much
lower growth rate than the wild-type bacterium.

<P>
This concludes what I'm going to discuss about prokaryotes. Several
conclusions seem to emerge from these studies. First, given
exponential growth and large population sizes, lots of mutations seem
to occur in bacterial populations. When bacteria under these
conditions are placed under strong selection, by means such as the
introduction of a predator or a parasite, adaptations countering the
effect of the selective agent rapidly appear and spread through the
population. This could not happen unless mutations which confer these
benefits were appearing. This must be the case when we consider that
standard practice in microbiology is to start cultures from single
colonies on agar plates - colonies which represent the descendents of
a single cell.  Whether the mutation is beneficial depends on the
environment that the mutant is in. In the presence of the selective
agent (e.g. a predator), the mutation is beneficial. In a different
environment the mutation may be detrimental. A common effect of
mutations conferring resistance to predators and parasites seems to be
a lowering of the maximum growth rate of the mutant bacteria. In at
least some cases (e.g. E. coli and T phages), this results from the
same mutation producing resistance and reducing the ability to take up
nutrients. In any case, the appearance of beneficial mutations seems
to occur in continuous culture in a number of bacterial species and is
probably a general phenomenon.

<P>
It is my opinion that these conclusions also apply to eukaryotes. I'll
discuss a few examples from work here in the Counter Culture Lab to
support this assertion.

<P>
Chlorella vulgaris is a common unicellular green alga that is used as
a "lab rat" in labs throughout the world. We've grown the same strain
of it for thousands of generations on agar and in liquid culture
without it losing its unicellular morphology. Dozens to hundreds of
labs have done this. Steady-state unicellular C. vulgaris cultures
were innoculated with the predator Ochromonas vellesiaca, a
phagotrophic flagellate. Within less then 100 generations a
multicellular form of the Chlorella became dominanat in the
culture. (Boraas 1983b, Boraas et al. 1998). The alga first formed
globose clusters of tens to hundreds of cells. After 10-20 generations
in the presence of the flagellate, eight-celled colonies
predominated. These colonies retained the eight-celled morphology
indefinitely in continuous culture and when plated onto agar. The
basis of the change appears to be a change in the cell wall. Cell
division in normal Chlorella occurs within the cell wall of the
maternal cell. The cell undergoes 1-4 divisions to form 2-16 daughter
cell. This is followed by a split in the mother cell wall and
dispersal of the neonatal cells. In a cuture, empty mother cell walls
are interspersed with whole cells at a ratio of about 1:4.  Empty
mother cell walls are not found in cultures of the multicellular
form. The colonies are enclosed in a "membrane" which appears to be
modified cell wall material.

<P>
As was seen in the bacterial cases, this mutation provided Chlorella
with resistance to predation at the cost of growth rate. Neonatal
colonies are barely small enough for Ochromonas to engulf. After they
have grown slightly they are to big to be eaten. In the presence of
the predator, the colonial form of Chlorella displaces the unicellular
form and persists. When the predator is not present, the unicellular
form displaces the colonial form. This makes sense as the colonial
form has less surface area exposed to the environment available for
nutrient uptake than the unicellular form has.

<P>
There is also evidence that mutations occur and are selected for in
animals grown in chemostats and related systems. Boraas (1983a)
observed several changes the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus when it
was grown for 24 months in a chemostat. The mean adult body size of
the animal declined steadily over time.  Rotifers ceased production of
males and resting eggs after 1-2 months in continuous culture,
suggesting that the chemostat environment selected against sexual
reproduction. After 2-3 months in the sexuality could not be induced
in animals removed from the culture. They appear to have lost the
ability to undergo sexual reproduction.

<P>
Bennett and Boraas (1988, 1989) saw even more striking changes in the
same rotifer species when it was grown in a turbidostat. A turbidostat
is a variation on the chemostat. While a chemostat is designed for
constant input of medium, a turbidostat is designed to keep the
organisms at a constant concentration. A turbidity sensor measures the
concentration of organisms in the culture. When exceeds a preset
value, additional medium is added. In Bennett and Boraas' study, the
sensor measured the concentration of residual food (algae) in the
culture (Boraas and Bennett 1988). When it dropped below a certain
level, more was added. This type of culture system allows the
organisms to grow at the maximum rate physiologically possible in a
given environment and selects for rapid growth rate. In a chemostat,
the investigator chooses the growth rate that the critters grow at and
the population density is a response variable, in a turbidostat the
investigator chooses the population density and the critters grow as
quickly as they can.

<P>
Bennett and Boraas saw the rotifers undergo several changes. The
result of the changes was a fast-growing strain of the rotifer. Over 8
months in the chemostat the maximum growth rate of the rotifers
increased from 0.053 h<SUP>-1</SUP> to 0.080 h<SUP>-1</SUP>. This
change persisted even when the animals were grown for over 100
generations in a chemostat at the slow growth rate of 0.009
h<SUP>-1</SUP>. There was a shift in fecundity to younger age classes
in the fast-growing strain.  Longevity of the fast-growing strain was
28% shorter than longevity in the parental strain. Egg development
time was shorter, and egg volume was considerably smaller in the
fast-growing strain. As seen in Boraas' (1983a) study, the adults were
smaller and sexuality was lost.

<P>
The rotifer example show changes in life history characters which are
under genetic control. These examples suggest that the argument made
for prokaryotes can be extended to eukaryotes. <A name=notes></A>

[3] Proteins are the workhorse chemicals in the cell. There are two
major kinds of proteins, structural proteins and enzymes. Typically an
enzyme is optimized to perform a simple chemical operation on another
chemical (the substrate). However it can also perform operations with
much less efficiency on other substrates. A change in an enzyme often
changes its efficiency on alternate substrates; it also may change the
optimal conditions in which the reaction occurs, e.g. the temperature
or the pH.

<P>
Diploid organisms have two copies of each gene. When a mutation in one
copy occurs the organism can have alternate alleles with different
properties. In some environments organisms with copies of both alleles
(they are said to be heterozygous for the gene) will have an
advantage.

[4] The human genome has 3 billion base pairs. The average rate of
point mutations is about 20-30 in a billion per individual. Almost all
point mutations in multi-cellular organisms are strictly neutral. In
human beings 90-97% of the DNA is "junk DNA" that does nothing (as
best as can be determined.) One third of the changes to codons
(sections of DNA that code for proteins) are silent; that is, the DNA
changes, but the the amino acid coded for remains the same. Thus
93-98% of all point mutations in humans are strictly neutral.

<P>
Of the remaining 2-7% almost all of them are also neutral. A typical
protein is a sequence of about 1,000 amino acids which folds up around
a reaction site consisting of about 50 amino acids. Changes in the
reaction site have a strong effect on the properties of the protein;
changes elsewhere often do not unless they affect the folding
pattern. As a result, less than 1% of the point mutations are subject
to selection. <A href="#note_7">[7]</A>

[6] A trait is a physical feature of an organism. An organism's traits
are determined by a combination of its genes and by its responses to
its environment. The effect of genes on traits is often very
indirect.

<A name=note_7><A>

<P>
[7] Most of the numbers relating to the size of the effective genome,
the number of genes, and the average size of genes are approximate and
are still being refined.

<P>
A number of genomes, both bacterial and eukaryote, have been
completely sequenced. Protein sizes average about 350 amino acids
(1050 base pairs).

<P>
Older estimates of the number of genes in the human genome fall in the
range 50-100 thousand. More recent estimates using data from the
genome project are about 60-70 thousand.

<P>
Estimates of the size of the effective genome vary. Drake gives an
estimate of 80,000,000 base pairs of coding DNA. The number may be as
low as 3% (Drake) or as high as 10% (older estimates). The issue is
complicated by the fact that some (unknown) percentage of the
non-coding DNA is not junk.

<P>
Estimating mutation rates is not simple. It should be understood that
current estimates are extrapolations from sampled sections in
genomes. Moreover mutation rates vary for different sites. Different
techniques, however, seem to consistently produce estimates of 1 to 6
point non-silent mutations in coding DNA per individual in humans. The
total number of point mutations per individual is much higher (Drake
gives ~64; other estimates are of the same order) but, as discussed in
<A href="#note_4">note 4</A>
almost all of these are either silent or are in non-coding (junk)
DNA. 

<A name=note_8><A>

<P>
[8] The percentages of occurrences of different alleles in a
population is always fluctuating because different individuals have
different numbers of offspring. In diploid species such as ourselves
there is an additional source of randomness; each offspring gets a
different combination of genes from its parents. Not only are the
percentages fluctuating, but they can by chance drift from one ratio
to another.

<P>
This random change is what is meant by genetic drift. When a
particular allele is beneficial compared to another the fluctuation
will be biased; this biased movement of the changes in ratios is
called natural selection. 

<A name=note_9><A>

<P>
[9] If we use the numbers in appendix I the effective genome size (for
humans) is about 80,000,000 base pairs and the average number of point
mutations in the effective genome is about 4. This works out that each
base pair in the effective genome will mutate about once in every
20,000,000 individuals.

<P>
This means that in species with large populations such as human beings
(currently) every relevant point mutation appears in the species. On
the other hand, given a small group such as a hunter/gatherer tribe, a
given mutation probably will not appear in the tribe.

When we speak of the frequency of mutations we have to distinguish
between the mutation rate for the entire genome and the mutation rate
for the effective genome (the 10% that is not junk DNA). In Genetics
148:1667-1686, April 1998) John W. Drake et al estimate that the
average human zygote has about 64 mutations, most of which occur in
"junk" DNA.

Note that for humans, the number of cell divisions prior to sperm
formation in a male of age 30 is about 400. This works out to about
1.6 mutations per sperm cell.

<P>
In the 28 January 1999 issue of Nature, in the article <I>"High
genomic deleterious mutation rates in hominids"</I> Walker and
Kneightey estimate that the mutation rate in the effective genome is a
bit higher, 4.2 mutations per individual, of which 1.6 are
deleterious. See <A href="#note_7">note 7</A> for further discussion.

"PAI-1 plasma levels in a general population without clinical evidence
of atherosclerosis: relation to environmental and genetic
determinants," by Margaglione M, Cappucci G, d'Addedda M, Colaizzo

Abstract:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) plasma levels have been
consistently related to a polymorphism (4G/5G) of the PAI-1 gene. The
renin-angiotensin pathway plays a role in the regulation of PAI-1
plasma levels.  An insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism of the
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been related to plasma
and cellular ACE levels. In 1032 employees (446 men and 586 women; 22
to 66 years old) of a hospital in southern Italy, we investigated the
association between PAI-1 4G/5G and the ACE I/D gene variants and
plasma PAI-1 antigen levels. None of the individuals enrolled had
clinical evidence of atherosclerosis. In univariate analysis, PAI-1
levels were significantly higher in men (P&lt;.001), alcohol drinkers
(P&lt;.001), smokers (P=.009), and homozygotes for the PAI-1 gene
deletion allele (4G/4G) (P=.012).  Multivariate analysis documented
the independent effect on PAI-1 plasma levels of body mass index
(P&lt;.001), triglycerides (P&lt;.001), sex (P&lt;.001), PAI-1 4G/5G
polymorphism (P=.019), smoking habit (P=.041), and ACE I/D genotype
(P=.042). Thus, in addition to the markers of insulin resistance and
smoking habit, gene variants of PAI-1 and ACE account for a
significant portion of the between-individual variability of
circulating PAI-1 antigen concentrations in a general population
without clinical evidence of atherosclerosis.

Accelerated binding and dissociation from lipids of a human
apolipoprotein variant," by Franceschini G, Vecchio G, Gianfranceschi
G, Magani D, Sirtori CR.

<P>
Abstract:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The lipid binding properties of apolipoprotein (apo) AIMilano, a
molecular variant of human apolipoprotein AI, characterized by the
Arg173----Cys substitution, was investigated by the use of
dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes. Both the variant AIMilano
and normal AI are incorporated to the same extent in stable complexes
isolated by gel filtration, showing similar dimensions and
stoichiometries. A higher affinity of apo-AIMilano for
dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine is suggested by the faster association
rate of the variant apoprotein compared to normal AI; similarly,
apo-AIMilano is more readily displaced by guanidine hydrochloride from
the isolated dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine- apoprotein
complexes. When the secondary structure of apo-AIMilano was
investigated by spectrofluoroscopy and circular dichroism, a higher
fluorescence peak wavelength and a lower alpha-helical content were
detected in the variant apoprotein compared to normal AI. The
substitution Arg173----Cys in the AIMilano dramatically alters the
amphipathic nature of the modified alpha-helical fragment of
apoprotein AI. The association rate with lipids is accelerated by an
increased exposure of hydrophobic residues. The reduced stability of
the lipid-apoprotein particles is possibly mediated by a reduction in
the number of helical segments involved in lipid association. The high
flexibility of the AIMilano apolipoprotein in the interaction with
lipids may explain its accelerated catabolism and the possibly
improved uptake capacities for tissue lipids. <A name=append_4></A>

Abstract:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The CCR5-Delta32 deletion obliterates the CCR5 chemokine and the
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 coreceptor on lymphoid cells,
leading to strong resistance against HIV-1 infection and AIDS. A
genotype survey of 4,166 individuals revealed a cline of CCR5-Delta32
allele frequencies of 0%-14% across Eurasia, whereas the variant is
absent among native African, American Indian, and East Asian ethnic
groups. Haplotype analysis of 192 Caucasian chromosomes revealed
strong linkage disequilibrium between CCR5 and two microsatellite
loci.  By use of coalescence theory to interpret modern haplotype
genealogy, we estimate the origin of the CCR5-Delta32-containing
ancestral haplotype to be approximately 700 years ago, with an
estimated range of 275-1,875 years. The geographic cline of
CCR5-Delta32 frequencies and its recent emergence are consistent with
a historic strong selective event (e.g. , an epidemic of a pathogen
that, like HIV-1, utilizes CCR5), driving its frequency upward in
ancestral Caucasian populations.
