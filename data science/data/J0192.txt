      <H1><CENTER>Carolina Motorsports Park - Hot Lap</CENTER></H1>

      <P>A welcome addition to the few purpose built road-racing facilities
      in the Southeast, the 2.235 mile, fourteen turn track five miles
      south of Kershaw, South Carolina has already proven a hit among
      the many marque club and Club racing participants who have sampled
      it's sinuous curves. Conceived in early 1998 by two road racers
      who were bemoaning the limited access to such storied venues
      as Road Atlanta and Charlotte (now Lowe's) Motor Speedway, Carolina
      Motorsports Park is now a reality, sure to gain in popularity
      for marque club driving events and amateur sports car racing.</P>

      <P>CMP's primary focus is towards this growing market. Such is
      the demand that Mickey Clyburn, the affable and able track manager,
      has had difficulty accommodating every group who wants to take
      advantage of a prime weekend date. Alan Wilson's challenging
      course design has succeeded in laying down the invitation for
      every driver that samples CMP to come back and unlock the secrets
      of this relatively easily learned, but difficult to master, road
      racing circuit. Let's take a lap at speed&#133;</P>

      <P>Heading down the pit straight towards Turn 1, a slightly more
      than 90 degree lefthand bend, requires braking at approximately
      the white timing line for most quicker street cars lining up
      the right side of the car parallel to the right side of the track
      no more than twelve inches from the edge of the pavement. Turn
      in for Turn 1 should be at the smaller secondary paved path coming
      in from the right, start turning in at the end of the paving,
      then move the point back as you become more comfortable. The
      goal is to place the left front and rear tires over the gently
      inclined curbing 3/4 to7/8 of the way around the Turn 1 apex.
      As with a majority of the corners at CMP, discipline is required
      to slow the car down to a point where the car will positively
      and completely respond to the initial steering input. Tracking
      out perhaps 3/4 from the left side of the road, bend the car
      to the right gently through the slightly quicker Turn 2, apexing
      with the right wheels gently on the curb/pavement seam precisely
      halfway, marked conveniently with a four foot thin white line
      extending out from the curbing, tracking out no further than
      halfway to the left, preferably 1/3 from the right side edge
      of the pavement in the short straight between the exit of Turn
      2 to the entrance of Turn 3. It is not necessary to &quot;straighten&quot;
      the car for the entry to Turn 3 as you gain confidence and speed
      through this section. Far more important is developing the ability
      to &quot;build &quot; from initial turn in at Turn 1, adding
      speed in graduated steps and extending the rhythm of turning
      left, then right, then left at ever increasing speed. The apex
      for Turn 3 is an area on the inside curb from 1/2 to 2/3 of the
      way around, unwinding and applying progressively more power as
      you rocket across the &quot;wetlands.&quot;</P>

      <P>Heading up into the &quot;Faith, Hope and Charity&quot; carousel,
      first you must negotiate successfully the dauntingly quick Turn
      4. By extrapolating turn in from the permanent braking markers
      on the right (5, 4, 3, 2, 1, turn-in), bend the car to the left
      without downshifting, allowing the left side tires to apex &frac12;
      way to almost the end of the Turn 4 curbing aiming the car for
      a point 1/3 of the width of the track from the right at the entrance
      of Turn 5. By creating the straight braking zone from the end
      of the Turn 4 curbing to turn-in for Turn 5, you can effectively
      use the uphill compression not only for negotiating Turn 4, but
      also to get the car slowed down as quickly as possible and effect
      a quick downshift at the end of the compressed braking zone.
      Entering Turn 5 from the center/right side of the track, place
      the right side wheels over the curb/pavement seam for an extended
      period, generally the last half of the curbing, with the ultimate
      goal of initiating a single arc that will allow you to apex over
      the last third of the curbing at Turn 7. As a way to ensure that
      you are on the correct radius, track-out from Turn 5 mandates
      placing the left wheels within six inches from the left edge
      of the pavement over the last quarter of the outside concrete
      rumble strip. This rumble strip is on the left side of the road
      over the last half of the short straight connecting Turn 5 with
      Turn 6. The highest point of this complex is just after the Turn
      5 apex curbing and the car will &quot;tighten&quot; it's line
      as you roll on the power headed towards this outside curb. As
      the road continues to fall away in the Turn 6/ Turn 7 complex,
      slight changes to the arc should be made through changes in throttle
      position, not the steering wheel. Exiting Turn 6 1/3 of the way
      from the left edge of the track will allow extending the most
      open approach to the all-important Turn 7. Make certain that
      the right side wheels do, in fact, touch the curb/pavement seam
      over the last 1/3 of the Turn 7 apex, finally allowing track-out
      to occur at the end of the rumble strip on driver's left.</P>

      <P>Taking a breath only for a moment, get ready for one of the
      most challenging corners on the circuit. A gentle bend to the
      right precedes the uphill, camber-gaining Turn 8. Allowing compression
      to aid in shortening the braking zone, use the permanent braking
      markers to extrapolate again the turn-in point. This less than
      90 degree right hand corner flows beautifully from the exit through
      &quot;the Swoop&quot;; Turn 9, a mere bend in the road&#133;Turn
      8 is inevitably one of those corners, like Turn 6 at Road Atlanta,
      that leaves a driver muttering &quot;I could've gone through
      quicker&#133;&quot; The speed of the corner again requires the
      precision to get the right side tires onto the curb from 2/3
      to 3/4 of the way through, otherwise, the sand-traps beckon&#133;Down
      the longest straight we go, headed into Turn 10; &quot;the Kink&quot;.
      Despite numerous boasts to the contrary present in every racetrack
      paddock, Turn 10 is not &quot;flat out&quot; in most marque club
      cars &#133;especially if you insist on placing the right side
      wheels over the raised pavement extension at the theoretical
      apex. The raised pavement is due to the presence of the &quot;West
      Course&quot; return road, coming in from the right, unsettling
      the car substantially precisely when you desire the most stability.
      By initiating a &quot;confidence lift&quot; and by being back
      on mild throttle as you bend the car to the right, the risk of
      unsettling the car and going off or presenting yourself as a
      spinning target to the following cars is avoided. Tracking out
      generally doesn't require a trip all of the way to the left edge
      of the track, but if it does, be sure that track out occurs at
      the end of the rumble strip on the left. Continuing the arc to
      the right gently will allow the car to aim for the extreme right
      side of the track in preparation for heavy braking for the tricky
      Turn 11.</P>

      <P>The difficulty with Turn 11 has to do with the fact that the
      initial 135 degree, 102 foot radius has a short straight followed
      by another 24 degree, 182 foot radius bend to the left which
      serves to extend the turn, hence the steering input. Driving
      deep into the corner all of the way on the right side of the
      track, brake enough to get the car to &quot;come down&quot; to
      the apex, which is 3/4 to the end of the curbing on the inside.
      Allowing the car to track out no more than 2/3 of the track width
      from the left, continue an arc to bring the car back over to
      the left to drive deep into the corner for entry into Turn 12.
      Turn 12 is more than 90 degrees, slightly more open than the
      entry to Turn 11, but don't get sucked into opening up the wheel
      prematurely, tracking all the way out to the end of the exit
      curbing.</P>

      <P><CENTER>Blast up the short straight to Turn 13, align the
      left side of the car parallel with the left side of the track
      with the left front six to twelve inches from the edge of the
      pavement, braking hard and turning in for the 90 degree right
      hand bend. Interestingly enough, the 57 foot radius for Turn
      13 is the same as the radius for Turn 14, but the almost 120
      degree Turn 14 requires you to slow more than for Turn 13 to
      allow the car to negotiate the corner without tracking out too
      far. The apex is again running the inside tires over the curbing
      3/4 of the way around Turn 13, tracking out fully to the left.
      Braking hard for Turn 14, turn-in is a small &quot;divot&quot;,
      or cutaway into the left side of the pavement about six inches
      long. Turn-in should be decisive, as this is the slowest corner
      on the course, exit speed being extremely important. Place the
      inside wheels over the last third of the curbing and track out
      to and at the very end of the rumble strip on the left side of
      the track. Move the car gently across to the right as you rise
      and fall over the gentle crest in the middle of the pit (start/finish)
      straight, preparing to line the car up on the right side of the
      track in anticipation of braking hard for Turn 1. If pitting,
      indicate your intention early and stay left at the exit of Turn
      14. Drive left of the yellow line and slow significantly for
      pit entrance. Take a deep breath, you've earned it! - <B><I><FONT
