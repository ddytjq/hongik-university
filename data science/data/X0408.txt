of many hunts to come, brought us to Grand Isle, Maine home of <a href="http://www.bearoutfitters.com">Keith
Cote's Sportsman's Pride Outfitters</a>. This is the first hunt with the
HuntGuide.com camera in tow. Markus Muhlhauser and I were truly &quot;loaded for
bear&quot;, Black bear that is, anticipating all the action Keith has in store
for us.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Arial;
layout-grid-mode:line">We arrived in camp on Wednesday morning to find 2 bears
had been taken with numerous sightings--some sows with cubs, which are off
limits and 1 missed opportunity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
weather was unseasonably hot, on the coolest day the mercury dipped to 91
degrees at midday, but the night temperatures were very comfortable.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Arial;

on the outskirts of a swamp on the edge of a Hemlock grove. After quickly
setting up the HuntGuide.com camera treestand we got into our stands and Keith
left us for the evening-we would sit until dark. The first night on stand was
uneventful.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Arial;
layout-grid-mode:line">Back at camp, the excitement level was high.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Two bowhunters, Mark from PA (booked through HuntGuide.com) and Bob from
CT had bears in the large walk in cooler-A pair of 225lb. Maine Black Bears.
There were also numerous sightings of bears this night. Ashley from Ohio (whose
father shot a 200lb bear Monday evening) a 16 year old girl who we dubbed
&quot;The Bear Magnet&quot; saw another sow and 2 cubs, Allen of CT passed on a
shot at a 200+ pounder, A PA gal had a skittish bear come into her bait, but
could not get a shot before the bear decided to disappear back into the woods.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Arial;
layout-grid-mode:line">Anticipation was high as we knew only a matter of time
and we would get our chance at a bear. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Arial;
layout-grid-mode:line">Markus and I alternated between hunting and filming, and
tonight was my turn with the bow while he manned the HuntGuide.com camera.
Thursday evening was again unseasonably hot, 95 degrees as we left camp headed
out for our stands at 1:45pm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
evening, the second evening of the hunt, proved to be a quiet one in the woods,
quiet for everyone--everyone except for Ashley, our &quot;Bear Magnet&quot;!<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Arial;
layout-grid-mode:line">Ashley and her Dad, Rick, had brought ATV&#146;s to travel
to and from the baits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rick would
bring her out to her stand and then pick her up at dark.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This night, 3 bears came into Ashley's bait at dark. It was
past legal shooting time so she patiently waited for her Dad show up to spook
the bears off the bait. Interestingly, Keith noted that someone on foot or an
ATV will spook the bear off the bait, yet it will return to that bait site
again, yet if Ashley had hollered or climbed down from her stand to spook the
bear, the bear learns where the hunter sat and will probably not come back to
that bait again.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Arial;
layout-grid-mode:line">Friday after lunch, Markus and I armed up with bows,
arrows, and camera gear headed back out to the woods on a silent vigil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The afternoon high broke 100 degrees--our Bucks N Does Human Scent
Elimination would be put to the test&nbsp; (for information on this <b> great
product</b> visit the <a href="http://www.bucksndoes.com">Bucks-N-Does website</a>).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
sat motionless for 5 hours--then he appeared! Markus spotted him first, a nice
boar cautiously coming to the bait at 6:30pm. The HuntGuide.com camera was
rolling while our hearts pumped wildly pushing adrenaline through our veins.
This bear would test our patience to the end. He would steal from our bait pile
and wander off to eat his snack, he kept coming back stealthfully placing each
step as he silently moved through the woods, all the time protecting his kill
zone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Keith had drilled into our
heads, &quot;Bowhunters, wait for a perfectly broadside shot--no quartering away
shots-- the bear will give you 100 opportunities if you wait, do not take a
marginal shot!!&quot;. Tough advise to follow, but the HuntGuide.com ProStaff
stresses that you listen to your guide, regardless of their advise--be it stand
or shot placement, technique, or tips on animal behavior--they know best and the
guides that we recommend are the absolute best at what they do.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Arial;
layout-grid-mode:line">Fifteen minutes later Keith's advise rang true, the bear
went perfect broadside at 17 yards, in less time than it takes to tell about it,
Markus drew his Hoyt Striker II and at the perfect second launched his wasp cam-lok
tipped 2315 shaft through both lungs of the bear plus buried that arrow 12&quot;
into the ground!! By the sound of it, the bear only went 40 yards and piled up
hard--we heard the tell-tale &quot;death moan&quot; --the whole thing was
awesome!! Although we wanted to recover Markus' bear ourselves, we again
listened to our guide's advice, and since we could not see the downed bear, we
went back to camp to get help.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Arial;
layout-grid-mode:line">Back<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>at
camp, everyone was buzzing. There was a 300+ pound bear in the cooler and in
addition to Markus' bear 2 more bears were down. One evening, 4 shots, 4 bears,
and 4 very happy hunters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
returning to our stand, we tracked Markus' bear just about 40 yards from the
bait site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A beautiful 200lb Black
Bear with a perfect coat--Markus and I were thrilled! Our hunt was successful,
the bear in the cooler and the incredible film footage (thanks to our patience)
proved it. This Friday night, Black Friday, Black Bear Friday that is, will be
one to remember.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not only for our
experience, but for victory shared with friends, fellow hunters, and Ashley!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Arial;
layout-grid-mode:line">Ashley, her Dad, and 2 guides headed back out to the big
woods of Maine, well after dark, to recover her bear. The wait back at camp was
tense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We were all routing for
Ashley, knowing she was a good shot, and of her patience (after all this was the
eighth bear she had seen this week), but her Dad had reported that he had
followed the blood trail for about 30 yards without seeing her bear, and then
the two of them headed back to camp to get help, that fact put Ashley on edge as
everyone else was recovering their bears after a short distance. We were
confident that her shot was on the mark...and it was!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Two hours later the trio of ATV&#146;s pulled into camp as the lodge emptied
to see the largest boar of the week strapped to one of the guide's ATV&#146;s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ashley was all smiles. High-fives were exchanged as Markus and I
congratulated this very special Ohio girl. A girl who loves the woods and is
lucky enough to share it with a very special man--her Dad!<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Arial;
layout-grid-mode:line">Keith Cote and his guides were very accommodating to all
in camp and did not give up even though there were 8 bears taken in 5 days.
There were still tags to fill and 1 day left to hunt. Adjustments were made in
where the remaining hunters were to sit. I would hunt a bait that had a big bear
working it. This bear didn't get big by being stupid, but Markus and I hoped
tonight he would err, so I could slip an arrow into his boiler room. We got into
our stand even earlier than days past and sat.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It was an uneventful sit until one half hour before dark. We
heard a large stick snap--not a stick broken by a light animal. Our imaginations
now in overdrive. We could hear walking and then silence, this bear was close,
laying low and waiting for complete darkness. All we could do was hope that our
shooting light outlasted this animal's patience.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none"><span style="font-family:Arial;
layout-grid-mode:line">Darkness crept in on us and my shooting light diminished
without ever seeing that animal. We packed up quietly and headed back to the
lodge. One hunter had 2 bears come into his stand but not to his bait--no shot
opportunity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The next morning we
went out to pull the camera stand, only to see our bait cleaned out--not a scrap
left! We'll be back for this bear!<o:p>
