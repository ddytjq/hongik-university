<h1>Memphis International Motorsport Park</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Memphis International Motorsport Park is a complex with an
1.8 mile road course, a drag strip, and a dirt oval, located
halfway between Memphis and Millington in Tennesee.
The track is located on Fite Rd. between US 51 and Raleigh-Millington Road.
</p>
<p>
A paved 7/8ths mile oval is reportedly under construction.

This "Hot Lap" was originally written by Norm Floyd.
<p> 
Memphis International Motorsports Park is a 1.8 mile facility with virtually
no elevation change. 
The .7 mile front straightaway is the entire drag strip plus shutdown areas,
so cars with good
straight line speed traditionally do well here.  The pavement is moderately
grippy and very
smooth with the exception of a fairly serious bump exiting turn 8, where the
asphalt joins the
concrete at the beginning of the drag strip burnout area.
<p>
Memphis was designed to represent a sample of several types of race
circuits.  Turns 1 & 2 ("the
carousel" - actually one long sweeper) are slightly banked.  They and the
front straight emulate
an oval track.  Turns 3 and 4 ("the kink" and "the M's"; actually a
left - right - left - right - left chicane) are like a traditional
road (some say autocross) course.  Turns 5 & 6 (the "double 90's")
represent an airport course.  Turns 7 & 8 ("Grant's Tomb", and
"the wall") imitate a street circuit
with their concrete walls and sequential 90 degree rights.
<p>
I currently race a Honda Civic in ITC (4 speed, 4.68 final drive), so my
description will reflect
that.  Prior to finally getting my car together, though, I worked F&C
at every Memphis race except one from 1987 when it opened, until mid-1993,
when the racing bug finally won out.
<p>
Start / Finish is about 1/4 mile into the front straight, so I'm in 4th
gear at 90+ when I go by, this
is probably your last chance this lap to check the gauges and the
mirrors in the same visual
sweep.  Turn 1 is a lot farther away than it looks (almost 1/2 mi.)
so just hammer down and keep
it straight.  
<p>
I tend to stay near the middle of the track at the end of the straight
and brake at the last shutdown
marker just enough to settle nose of the car (remember, my top speed
is only 108) and lightly
pitch it into this long banked right-hander . I let the car scrub
speed - using the throttle mostly for steering corrections - and pull
it down toward the inside until I get to the apex (which is
conveniently marked with a stripe).  At that point I squeeze open the
throttle and left foot brake
toward the patch of "new" asphalt on the outside at the exit.  I let
the car get just onto the new
"wide spot" of pavement before going all-out down the small hill
toward turn 3.
<p>
Most GT-4 and slower cars make it through 3 wide open - it just takes
some practice, and no
small amount of guts.  After exiting 2, move far right to get the best
line and stay hard in the
throttle. Early apex the left-handers 3 and 4-A and stay on the power
until about 100' before the
FIA curbing after 4-A. Then hard brake while staying left to set up
for 4-B.
<p>
4-B, C, & D  is actually the second most important series of turns on
the course, and exit speed
is critical. Apex 4-B, the right-hander, really early and slow or you'll
overshoot the deceptive
4-C. As soon as you can, ease the throttle on, steer left, and clip the
center of the apex of 4-C.  At
this point you can pretty well straighten out 4-D and get on the power,
if you did it right. And if
you did, you may  well be rewarded with an opportunity to pass someone
down the moderate
straight before the 90's. 
<p>
Stay right entering the 90's and brake just about the f|ag
station.  Rotate the car slightly and late
apex 5, a 90 degree left, then immediately early apex 6, a 90 degree
right.  Get back on the power early (if you have an open differential,
you'll have a little problem with wheelspin) and
hammer it toward 7.   
<p>
Trail-brake entering 7 just enough to settle the front end and stay out
of the formidable looking tire barrier. This is the most important, and
dangerous, maneuver at Memphis.  Stay right, but watch for cars entering
the pits!  The plentiful marbles on the left are made of wall magnet
material and if you get in them, that's where you'll watch the rest
of the race from - the wall!  I'm not sure "stay right, but late apex
left" makes sense, but that's what you should do.  Hold neutral throttle
and let the car drift as close as you dare to the left hand wall
of "Grant's Tomb" (so named because the Grant brothers, Richard and Milton
both hit it in the inaugural Memphis race).  Then center apex 8, clipping
the inside as close as possible on the right (looking up the corner worker
above's pantleg).  (NOTE: GT & Formula cars tend to make this 2 early
apex turns with a short burst of power between 7 & 8.  SS, IT, and Prod.
cars mostly drive it as described.) 
<p>
Power on, lift for the bump at the exit of 8, and then hammer down and
drift toward the outside wall.  Be careful not to get too close to the
edge here because the pavement literally drops off a bit about 8" from
the wall, and will literally suck you in if you get too close! You need
to carry your best exit speed here as it is the entrance to that long
front straight.  Once you straighten out here, you can start checking
gauges and mirrors again as you approach Start / Finish.
<p>
F/A's have lapped Memphis in under a minute, but it's extremely rare.
1:04 will get the pole for most Nationals.  GT-1's do about 1:11;
SRF's & GP's about 1:20.  ITC's usually run in the low 1:30's.
