<h1>Vasser races to first IndyCar win at Miami Grand Prix</h1>
Dark clouds threatened but did not spoil the event, which was also the first time these top-of-the-line open-wheel race cars ran at the new Metro-Dade Homestead Motorsports Complex 30 miles south of Miami. Qualifying was postponed by rain Saturday and moved to this morning.<p>
De Ferran, the 1995 Rookie of the Year, was unable to reel in Vasser after closing the gap and had to settle for second. Robby Gordon passed Scott Pruett and Bobby Rahal at the end of the race to take third, with Pruett fourth and Rahal fifth.<p>
Vasser's earned his first IndyCar victory. Last year, Vasser was awarded the June Budweiser/G.I. Joe's 200 when race stewards disqualified Al Unser Jr. because of a ground clearance issue. When the ruling was overturned by IndyCar in September, Unser was declared the winner.<p>
&quot;It feels great to finally get that monkey off my back,&quot; Vasser said.  &quot;Once I got the lead, I just ran conservatively to the end and got the win.&quot;<p>
Rains stopped the race after 34 laps when race officials decided to drop the red flag rather than continuing to log laps under caution.<p>
&quot;I was never happy to get the Portland win, and there was no emotion in losing it,&quot; Vasser said. &quot;It feels a lot better to win one this way, to embrace my team and enjoy it.<p>
           &quot;But the celebrating will be short-lived because we have another race to get ready for in two weeks.&quot;<p>
During what amounted to a limited green-flag run, Canadian Paul Tracy looked unbeatable in his Mercedes-powered Penske car. But Tracy developed gearbox problems and was forced to retire as the race moved into its final 50 laps.<p>
Tracy, who grabbed the pole during this morning's qualifying, returned to Team Penske after spending 1995 with Newman/Haas racing.<p>
De Ferran picked up where he left off at the end of last season. He won the season's final race, the Grand Prix of Monterey, to snatch top rookie honors from fellow Brazilian Christian Fittipaldi.<p>
Gordon, the hard-charging 27-year-old, was engaged in a dramatic duel with Rahal for fourth place before slower cars provided him with the opening he needed to shoot past. He charged after Pruett and beat him by a nose at the finish.<p>
Canadian rookie Greg Moore found himself among the top five but had to settle for seventh after being assessed a stop-and-go The 20-year old became the second-youngest IndyCar driver in history with Sunday's start.<p>
Moore won last year's Indy Lights title and is driving a light blue Player's International-sponsored car similar to the one driven by fellow Canadian Jacques Villenueve, last year's points champion who bolted for Formula One.<p>
Unser moved up through the field impressively before getting tangled with Roberto Guerrero after 75 laps. Unser was running fifth but dropped a lap behind the leaders while the nose on his Penske-Mercedes was changed during a caution period and finished eighth.<p>
Michael Andretti, who finished ninth, was involved in a similar incident when he apparently ran into the back wheel of Mauricio Gugelmin. The contact snapped the right front wing off Andretti's car, costing him a lap under a caution period.<p>
Andretti's accident came on a restart that was caused when Roberto Moreno spun out at the start of the race.<p>
The race consisted of 133 laps around the 1.51-mile oval track for 200 miles. The next IndyCar event is the Grand Prix of Brazil on March 17.<p><hr>
