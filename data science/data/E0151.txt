                    Perforce Software has graciously allowed Open Source software

                  In order to get Perforce up and running on your system, you 
                  will need to download the Perforce client program for your OS. 
                  Perforce Software provides clients for just about every OS freely 
                  on their web site at:<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://www.perforce.com/perforce/loadprog.html" target="_blank"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  http://www.perforce.com/perforce/loadprog.html</font></a><br>
                  <br>
                  All you need to do is download the appropriate 'p4' binary for 
                  your OS from their web site. You may also want to download or 
                  browse the documentation for p4, although it is quite simple 
                  to use from the command line and has extensive command line 
                  help.<br>
                  <br>
                  Note: If you have not upgraded recently you should upgrade your 
                  copy of Perforce to the latest 2002.1 edition which has some 
                  new features that our Perforce server supports. However our 
                  depot should work with most Perforce clients right back to the 
                  2000.1 series.<br>
                  <br>
                  In order to use Perforce you will need a TCP/IP connection to 
                  the internet, either via modem or direct connect. Accessing 
                  Perforce via modem is actually quite fast, and we have successfully 
                  done remote development over a 28K modem line from Australia!<br>

                  </table>
                  <br>
                  where you would replace YOURNAME_YOURMACHINE_YOUROS with a unique 
                  name (you can't use a client that someone else is already using 
                  anonymously!). For instance a valid client name might be: JOEBLOGGS_DEVEL_LINUX<br>
                  <br>
                  The client names the view that maintains the information about 
                  what files you have checked out on that system, and it must 
                  be unique for each user, and each machine. If you are doing 
                  development under multiple OS'es or multiple machines, you need 
                  a separate client view for each machine and each OS that will 
                  contain a copy of the source code from Perforce (hence the above 
                  naming convention for clients).<br>
                  <br>
                  Once you have the above variables set up, you can see if Perforce 
                  can access our server by typing the following:<br>

                  You should see something similar to the following if it can 
                  connect successfully:<br>

                  up your client mapping:</font></b><br>
                  Once you are are able to connect, you need to set up your client 
                  mapping since by default it will be empty. The client space 
                  is what allows you to map in only the portions of the software 
                  respository that you care about, and where to put them on your 
                  local system. The client information is then stored remotely 
                  on our server so it knows what files you have on your system 
                  and where they live (so if you delete stuff manually you will 
                  need to do a forced sync!).<br>
                  <br>
                  To set up your client mapping, type:<br>
                  <br>
                  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  p4 client<br>
                  </font> <br>
                  which will bring you into your editor of choice. It will include 
                  comments at the top about what the part of the file are used 
                  for. There are two parts that you need to modify; the 'root' 
                  definition and the 'view' definition. The 'root' is the root 
                  directory where all files get checked out onto your system, 
                  and this should be the root of the openwatcom directory (ie: 
                  /home/KendallB/openwatcom is where I put the Open Watcom source 
                  code on Unix systems, or d:\openwatcom for DOS/Windows/OS2 systems). 
                  For example:<br>
                  <br>
                  Root: &nbsp; &nbsp; <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  d:\openwatcom<br>
                  </font> <br>
                  The 'options' defines what options are in effect for that client. 
                  The most important one you will want to change is the 'nocompress' 
                  option to 'compress'. By enabling compression, you will drastically 
                  reduce the time required for syncs over an internet connection!<br>
                  <br>
                  The 'view' defines what parts of the perforce repository you 
                  want mapped to your local drive. The simplest mapping which 
                  will pull down all the MGL files you would need (and the one 
                  you should probably use) would be:<br>
                  <br>
                  View:<br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  //depot/openwatcom/... //YOURNAME_YOURMACHINE_YOUROS/...<br>
                  </font> <br>
                  where you would replace the 'YOURNAME_YOURMACHINE_YOUROS' above 
                  with the name of your client. This line indicates that all files 
                  get mapped to the d:\openwatcom directory and all subdirectories 
                  under this (like bld, docs etc). Now once you have the client 
                  view defined, exit your editor and it will send the changes 
                  to the perforce server.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Syncing 
                  up for the first time:</font></b><br>
                  The Open Watcom software respository contains a lot of code, 
                  and doing a full sync will pull down well in excess of 80 meg 
                  of files. Hence in order to save time for the initial sync, 
                  you can download and install all the files from the latest source 
                  achive of the software to your system, and then tell Perforce 
                  that you have all files at the time that archive was made. Then 
                  when you sync up you will only pull down all the files that 
                  have changed since the last official source archive release.<br>
                  <br>
                  For example, to do the initial sync for Open Watcom, use the 
                  following commands:<br>
                  <br>
                  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; p4 flush -f @open_watcom_0.8.0<br>
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; p4 sync<br>
                  </font> <br>
                  to tell Perforce that you have all the files at the label 'open_watcom_0.8.0' 
                  (change open_watcom_0.8.0 to the label appropriate for the source 
                  archive you have downloaded). The 'p4 sync' then grabs any changes 
                  that have occured since the 'open_watcom_0.8.0' label and ZIP 
                  files were built. Once you have sync'ed up the first time, you 
                  should only use 'p4 sync' to get the latest updates to all the 
                  files.<br>

                  The big difference between Perforce and other SCM systems like 
                  RCS is that Perforce is 'change' oriented. When you submit a 
                  changelist, included in the list will be all of the files that 
                  you currently have opened (if you don't want a file in that 
                  change list, simply delete it from the change list in the editor 
                  and it won't be submited but will remain in your list of open 
                  files are the submit). You <b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">must</font></b> 
                  provide a description for the change, and then the entire set 
                  of files associated with the changes is submitted as a single 
                  change to the server, including file additions and deletions! 
                  Hence when you need to revert back to older versions of the 
                  code, you can do it via the revision number for a specific file, 
                  a change list number to go back to the state when a particular 
                  change was submitted, or a label which you defined earlier (SciTech's 
                  build system automatically adds labels for builds so we can 
                  revert all code back to the release code for later testing).<br>
