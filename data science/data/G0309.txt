<p><a name="about"><FONT SIZE=+1><b>About the Hubble Telescope</b></FONT></a>
<P>

	The Hubble Space Telescope is a cooperative program of the
European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) to operate a long-lived space-based observatory
for the benefit of the international astronomical community.  HST is an
observatory first dreamt of in the 1940s, designed and built in the
1970s and 80s, and operational only in the 1990s.  Since its
preliminary inception, HST was designed to be a different type of
mission for NASA -- a permanent space-based observatory.  To
accomplish this goal and protect the spacecraft against instrument and
equipment failures, NASA had always planned on regular servicing
missions.  Hubble has special grapple fixtures, 76 handholds, and
stabilized in all three axes.  HST is a 2.4-meter reflecting telescope
which was deployed in low-Earth orbit (600 kilometers) by the crew of
the space shuttle Discovery (STS-31) on 25 April 1990.
<P>
	Responsibility for conducting and coordinating the science 
operations of the Hubble Space Telescope rests with the Space 
Telescope Science Institute (STScI) on the Johns Hopkins University 
Homewood Campus in Baltimore, Maryland.  STScI is operated for NASA 
by the Association of University for Research in Astronomy, Incorporated 
(AURA).
<P>
	HST's current complement of science instruments include 
two cameras, two spectrographs, and fine guidance sensors (primarily 
used for astrometric observations).  Because of HST's location above 
the Earth's atmosphere, these science instruments can produce high 
resolution images of astronomical objects. Ground-based telescopes 
can seldom provide resolution better than 1.0 arc-seconds, except 
momentarily under the very best observing conditions.  HST's 
resolution is about 10 times better, or 0.1 arc-seconds.
<P>
	When originally planned in 1979, the Large Space Telescope 
program called for return to Earth, refurbishment, and relaunch every 
5 years, with on-orbit servicing every 2.5 years.  Hardware lifetime 
and reliability requirements were based on that 2.5-year interval 
between servicing missions.  In 1985, contamination and structural 
loading concerns associated with return to Earth aboard the shuttle 
eliminated the concept of ground return from the program.  NASA decided 
that on-orbit servicing might be adequate to maintain HST for its 15-
year design life.  A three year cycle of on-orbit servicing was adopted.  
The first HST servicing mission in December 1993 was an enormous success.  
Future servicing missions are tentatively planned for March 1997, 
mid-1999, and mid-2002.  Contingency flights could still be added 
to the shuttle manifest to perform specific tasks that cannot wait 
for the next regularly scheduled servicing mission (and/or required 
tasks that were not completed on a given servicing mission).
<P>
	The five years since the launch of HST in 1990 have been momentous, 
with the discovery of spherical aberration and the search for a practical
solution.  The STS-61 (Endeavour) mission of December 1993 fully obviated 
the effects of spherical aberration and fully restored the functionality 
of HST.

<p><hr><p>
<p><a name="science"><FONT SIZE=+1><b>The Science Instruments</b></FONT></a>
<P>
<ul>
<li><B>Wide Field/Planetary Camera 2</B>

	<P>The original Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC1) was changed 
out and displaced by WF/PC2 on the STS-61 shuttle mission in December 1993.  
WF/PC2 was a spare instrument developed in 1985 by the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
<P>
	WF/PC2 is actually four cameras.  The relay mirrors in WF/PC2 
are spherically aberrated to correct for the spherically aberrated 
primary mirror of the observatory.  (HST's primary mirror is 2 microns 
too flat at the edge, so the corrective optics within WF/PC2 are too 
high by that same amount.)
<P>
	The "heart" of WF/PC2 consists of an L-shaped trio of wide-field 
sensors and a smaller, high resolution ("planetary") camera tucked in 
the square's remaining corner. <P>

<li><B>Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement</B><p>

	COSTAR is not a science instrument; it is a corrective optics 
package that displaced the High Speed Photometer during the first 
servicing mission to HST.  COSTAR is designed to optically correct 
the effects of the primary mirror's aberration on the three remaining 
scientific instruments:  Faint Object Camera (FOC), Faint Object 
Spectrograph (FOS), and the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS).<P>

<Li><B>Faint Object Camera</B><p>

	The Faint Object Camera is built by the European Space Agency.  
It is the only instrument to utilize the full spatial resolving power 
of HST.
<P>
	There are two complete detector system of the FOC.  Each uses 
an image intensifier tube to produce an image on a phosphor screen that 
is 100,000 times brighter than the light received.  This phosphor image 
is then scanned by a sensitive electron-bombarded silicon (EBS) television 
camera.  This system is so sensitive that objects brighter than 21st 
magnitude must be dimmed by the camera's filter systems to avoid saturating 
the detectors.  Even with abroad-band filter, the brightest object which 
can be accurately measured is 20th magnitude.
<P>
	The FOC offers three different focal ratios: f/48, f/96, and 
f/288 on a standard television picture format.  The f/48 image measures 
22 X 22 arc-seconds and yields resolution (pixel size) of 0.043 arc-seconds.  
The f/96 mode provides an image of 11 X 11 arc-seconds on each side and a 
resolution of 0.022 arc-seconds.  The f/288 field of view is 3.6 X 3.6 arc-
seconds square, with resolution down to 0.0072 arc-seconds.<P>

<li><B>Faint Object Spectrograph</B><p>

	A spectrograph spreads out the light gathered by a telescope so 
that it can be analyzed to determine such properties of celestial objects 
as chemical composition and abundances, temperature, radial velocity, 
rotational velocity, and magnetic fields.  The Faint Object Spectrograph 
(FOS) exmaines fainter objects than the HRS, and can study these objects 
across a much wider spectral range -- from the UV (1150 Angstroms) through 
the visible red and the near-IR (8000 Angstroms).
<P>
	The FOS uses two 512-element Digicon sensors (light intensifiers) 
to light.  The "blue" tube is sensitive from 1150 to 5500 Angstroms (UV to 
yellow).  The "red" tube is sensitive from 1800 to 8000 Angstroms (longer 
UV through red).  Light can enter the FOS through any of 11 different 
apertures from 0.1 to about 1.0 arc-seconds in diameter.  There are also 
two occulting devices to block out light from the center of an object while 
allowing the light from just outside the center to pass on through.  This 
could allow analysis of the shells of gas around red giant stars of the 
faint galaxies around a quasar.
<P>
	The FOS has two modes of operation PP low resolution and high 
resolution.  At low resolution, it can reach 26th magnitude in one hour 
with a resolving power of 250.  At high resolution, the FOS can reach 
only 22nd magnitude in an hour (before S/N becomes a problem), but the 
resolving power is increased to 1300.<P>

<li><B>Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph</B><p>
	The High Resolution Spectrograph also separates incoming light 
into its spectral components so that the composition, temperature, 
motion, and other chemical and physical properties of the objects can 
be analyzed.  The HRS contrasts with the FOS in that it concentrates 
entirely on UV spectroscopy and trades the extremely faint objects for 
the ability to analyze very fine spectral detail.  Like the FOS, the 
HRS uses two 521-channel Digicon electronic light detectors, but the 
detectors of the HRS are deliberately blind to visible light.  One tube 
is sensitive from 1050 to 1700 Angstroms; while the other is sensitive 
from 1150 to 3200 Angstroms.
<P>
	The HRS also has three resolution modes:  low, medium, and high.  
"Low resolution" for the HRS is 2000 -- higher than the best resolution 
available on the FOS.  Examining a feature at 1200 Angstroms, the HRS 
can resolve detail of 0.6 Angstroms and can examine objects down to 
19th magnitude.  At medium resolution of 20,000; that same spectral 
feature at 1200 Angstroms can be seen in detail down to 0.06 Angstroms, 
but the object must be brighter than 16th magnitude to be studied.  High 
resolution for the HRS is 100,000; allowing a spectral line at 1200 
Angstroms to be resolved down to 0.012 Angstroms.  However, "high resolution" 
can be applied only to objects of 14th magnitude or brighter.  The HRS can 
also discriminate between variation in light from ojbects as rapid as 100 
milliseconds apart.<P></ul>
<p><hr><p>
<a name="mission"><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Mission Operations and Observations</B></FONT></a><p>

	Although HST operates around the clock, not all of its time 
is spent observing.  Each orbit lasts about 95 minutes, with time allocated 
for housekeeping functions and for observations.  "Housekeeping" functions 
includes turning the telescope to acquire a new target, or avoid the Sun or 
Moon, switching communications antennas and data transmission modes, receiving 
command loads and downlinking data, calibrating and similar activities.
<P>
	When STScI completes its master observing plan, the schedule is 
forwarded to Goddard's Space Telescope Operations Control Center (STOCC), 
where the science and housekeeping plans are merged into a detailed operations 
schedule.  Each event is translated into a series of commands to be sent to 
the onboard computers.  Computer loads are uplinked several times a day to 
keep the telescope operating efficiently.
<P>
	When possible two scientific instruments are used simultaneously 
to observe adjacent target regions of the sky.  For example, while a 
spectrograph is focused on a chosen star or nebula, the WF/PC (pronounced 
"wiff-pik") can image a sky region offset slightly from the main viewing 
target.  During observations the Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS) track their 
respective guide stars to keep the telescope pointed steadily at the 
right target.
<P>
	If an astronomer desires to be present during the observation, 
there is a console at STScI and another at the STOCC, where monitors 
display images or other data as the observations occurs.  Some limited 
real-time commanding for target acquisition or filter changing is performed 
at these stations, if the observation program has been set up to allow for 
it, but spontaneous control is not possible.
<P>
	Engineering and scientific data from HST, as well as uplinked 
operational commands, are transmitted through the Tracking Data Relay 
Satellite (TDRS) system and its companion ground station at White Sands, 
New Mexico.  Up to 24 hours of commands can be stored in the onboard computers.  <P>
Data can be broadcast from HST to the ground stations immediately or stored 
on tape and downlinked later.
<P>
	The observer on the ground can examine the "raw" images and other 
data within a few minutes for a quick-look analysis.  Within 24 hours, 
GSFC formats the data for delivery to the STScI.  STScI is responsible 
for data processing (calibration, editing, distribution, and maintenance 
of the data for the scientific community).
<P>
	Competition is keen for HST observing time.  Only one of every 
ten proposals is accepted.  This unique space-based observatory is 
operated as an international research center; as a resource for 
astronomers world-wide.
