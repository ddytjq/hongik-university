facilities for disabled visitors. The guide is probably the most complete

(officially known as the Lookers Volkswagen Stand). The stand is a large concrete stand with a concourse underneath.
The stand shows its age a little by having wooden seats and very uncomfortable they are as well. There are some seats with an 
obscured view. 
Turnstiles to the stand are on either
side of the ground with no connecting route, forcing people using
turnstiles 44-47 to walk around three sides of the ground.
</P><P>The stand has both food and beer available (a good thing due to the lack
of away friendly pubs). For most games visiting families can use Burnleys
family stand. It also has a TV showing Sky Sports.
</P><P>The toilet facilities are limited and somewhat antiquated.
</P><P>Burnleys safety officer declined to talk to us about the club
policy on banners and musical instruments into the ground, however it has
been reported that previously flags and banners could be spread out on
empty seats (which are no longer as likely to be found at most games) and
that musical instruments have not been permitted.

far between and recommend visitors drinking in the ground or out of town.
However a few pubs around the ground will let away fans in
(often depending on your club). 
</P><P>Worth a look are Burnley Cricket Club (next to the ground) which also
does food on match days. The Queen Victoria is also popular with away fans
with families.
</P><P>Small numbers of away fans are sometimes admitted to the SparrowHawk on
Church Street (normally only for smaller games) which boasts a good
choice of beers (in the front bar)  and possibly the Mechanics
on Manchester Road. The food in The Sparrow Hawk comes particularly highly
recommended, with a mix of 'cafe bar' type offering (in the back bar) to
football special pie and peas (in the front bar).
 
The town centre (especially Yate's on St. James St and Sidewalk 53 on
Boot Way, near the bus station) should be avoided if wearing colours as
should Yorkshire Street (the road leading from the town centre to the
ground), especially The Wellington, The Park View and The Bricklayers.
 
There are also two cafe bars at the ground 'The Centre Spot' and 'Cafe
Claret', but we believe these also do not permit away fans.
</P><P>One final possibility is to do you drinking in another nearby town
(Blackburn, Accrington etc).
</P><P>A fair chunk of this info has been provided by the author of a number a
excellent football guides (and Burnley fan), who is currently working on
'A beer drinkers guide to Burnley FC'. It's probably worth checking his <a class="entry" href="surf.to/londonclarets">London Clarets</a> site out for more info.

the Brunshaw entrance to the ground. More food options are available on
Yorkshire Street (including curry, fired chicken, pizza, kebab, Chinese,

entire club a bad name. Whilst the vast majority of fans are very friendly 
(and certainly helpful) there are a few who have given Burnley a 
reputation for trouble. As with most clubs in this situation trouble is
only likely when the opposition also have a reputation.
</P><P>Although Burnley have many local rivals (Preston, Blackpool, Bolton, Wigan 
and even Stockport) we have come across no rivalry as strong as that
between Burnley and Blackburn (which is felt equally strongly by both sets
of fans). 
</P><P>One Burnley fan wrote the following 
</P><P>".....We do have a hooligan element, but Burnley fans care about their
team and are, although I'm biased, amongst the most committed and
passionate in the land. We've been starved of success for so long and
blown it so often that we've developed a dry sense of humour to help us
get by, but success is something we crave. We're committed but I wouldn't
say we're loyal, in that we're quick to look for someone to blame when
something goes wrong. A Burnley manager is generally no more than two bad
results away from calls for resignation...."
</P></p></td></tr><table><BR><table class="entry" cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td><H3 class="entry">Local Police And Stewards</H3><p><P>The following was sent to us on the subject on Police and Stewards
</P><P>".....Burnley police strike me as friendly compared to most, but then I've
never been an away fan in Burnley and when you're used to the Met and 
British Transport Police I suppose they would. There will be a heavy
police presence for some games, but I don't generally get the impression
they're looking for trouble. The stewards, on the other hand, are useless,
officious pricks who like telling people they can't stand there but who
are deaf to any complaints about occasional racism. They have a reputation
for picking on kids but not standing up to the real troublemakers. They
also seem to like to herd away fans about. A useless bunch of sods, I'd
sack the lot of them. Burnley supporters complain constantly about the
stewards, but nothing ever seems to be done....."
</P></p></td></tr><table><BR><table class="entry" cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td><H3 class="entry">Chants</H3><p>As you would expect the majority of songs unique to Burnley are about
neighbours Blackburn. Both clubs share similar variants of the Wild Rover
(No Nay Never) although Burnleys version appears to have more verses.
</P><P>Away fans can taunt the with Dingle references (just a town full of dingles, 1-0 in your Dingle Dome etc) and even their proximity to Yorkshire (You're just a small town in Yorkshire).
</P><P>One piece of trivia is that Burnley claim to be the originators of the
ubiquitous 'Who ate all the pies' chant, at a game at Maidstone in the
early 90s, when they ran out of pies in record time. At least one other
source has claimed this song to be associated with Wigan Rugby League Club
since the mid-80s (but then who'd believe a pie-eating egg chaser :) )

http://www.tonysburnleysite.com</a>
for providing lots of info. Thanks also go to the staff in
the club shop for answering a few questions about the ground and to the
staff at the Queen Victoria for info about the pub.
</P><P>A huge thank you also goes to <a class="entry" href="http://surf.to/londonclarets">London
Clarets</a> webmaster Firmo for a 
colossal amount of info, not just an in depth guide to the pubs, but
for info on other subjects as well. 
</P><P>It should be noted that the pictures used in this entry are from the Blackburn 
derby game, we intentionally used very little of the info gained from this visit
as there were exceptional circumstances for this game so stewarding, policing,
bar facilities etc were not the same as would be expected for a normal game.
