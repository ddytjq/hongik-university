<TD colSpan=2>I was General Secretary of the Barbados Football Association 
from 1995  2000.  I still play/coach the St. Lucy Football League Team.  
My greatest achievement as player/coach  Winning our Division 4 Zonal 
championship in debut year  1992, the overall Division 3 in 1994, the 
St. Lucy Team went to the quarterfinals of our islandwide K.O. 
Tournament 3 years in a row 1993, 1994 & 1995 losing narrowly by 1 goal 
margins in extra-time (no sudden death then!) on  2 occasions to teams 
who went onto win the tournament!
<p>
I love the history of football, my hobbies include traveling, reading, 
computer programming, desktop publishing, soccer  playing (not as often 
as I would like) & coaching, photography, community activities.
<p>
My ultimate dream would be for Barbados to become the first country 
with a population of less than a million (right now barely around 300,000 people) 
to qualify for the World Cup Finals in any of the FIFA Tournaments!  I also 
wish to attend a World Cup Final (perhaps the one in Trinidad in September 2001!).

<TD colSpan=2>When I was a kid, I used to hate soccer, but that may have 
been because I was forced to play (at school) in the cold and rain, and I 
had no idea what I was doing. When I was about 11 years old, I started 
watching the game on TV and discovered that I enjoyed keeping track of the 
teams and leagues I was watching. I therefore became a soccer statistician 
at an early age! (Not only that, I became less bad at playing the game...) 
I am now an academic statistician, having just finished my Ph. D.; some of 
the work I do can be applied to analysis and prediction of sports leagues 
(though not well enough to make me rich!).</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

"normal" soccer, when 14, I played with older people (18+) and scored 7 
goals (the third best of the team, and the second in average goals / minutes 
played). Later, in High School, my team was DR Ñhoskos, I was the captain

more than 60 games). The rest of the team were: Aldo, Raul, Sergio, Edmundo, 
Eliud, Alejandro and Fernando.<br>
I like soccer since 10 or 11, my biggest wish is to go to a World Cup game.

      well presented on the internet. I started collecting football results about 
      Cyprus since the 1996/97 season and have recently been able to get together 
      a wealth of information about the Cyprus national team since its very first 
      game back in 1960. I aim to keep maintaining this data up-to-date (as well as

<TD colSpan=2>My interest in football started with the World Cup 1982 in 
Spain, and ever since then I have been collecting all sorts of football 
data. My main interest lies in match characteristics and player data from 
all over the world. I am working on an archive of player profiles, listing 
for a player seasonwise the club he played for, the number of matches he 
played, the number of matches he came on as a substitute and the number of 
goals he scored in league, cup, European Cup, and internationals. I am 
especially interested in international matches and European Cup 
competitions, and therefore I very much like the EC series in IFFHS's 
magazine "Libero International". Not surprisingly, my specialty is Dutch 
football.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

to be somehow part of the fabulous work that is being done here. I have collected 
almost all possible data about Icelandic football and big part of my work at DV is 
to update and calculate our statistics.<br>
Although my specialization is Icelandic football I have always followed all 
kinds of football statistics and therefore ready to take on something else in 
the future, but my next mission is to make our Iceland coverage the best there 
is whether you look around in Iceland or somewhere else.<br>
Finally a thank you note to my mentor and fellow woker here at DV, Vidir Sigurdsson, 
who possilble some of you know for his fabulous work on Icelandic football, Islensk 
knattspyrna 1981,1982,1983...-1998. He opened my mind to the extraordinary world

I started being interested in football in 1985, with BEL-POL 2:0 (1st May 1985) being
probably the first national team match I 
watched on TV. Almost simultaneously I developed a strong affinity for football history 
and statistics, with whatever scanty
resources I was able to hold on in the 80s. Much later I connected my football passion 
with the Net, assisting in the
creation of pl.rec.sport.pilka-nozna, our national football newsgroup (June 1997), where 
I am a regular, if infrequent,
poster.<br>Big plan for the future: some piece of software to keep league statistics 
for X Window and/or console.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

I have started being interested in soccer since I was 7. I started collecting 
football books in 1994, even I had been fond on stats even before.
I completely fell in love with my team, Vicenza, after its promotion in Italian 
serie B (1994) and then I started going to the stadium. Now I have a web site in 
which I collect stats around Vicenza and its history.

    <TD colSpan=2>For the last few years, and due to the pressure of work and 
      business, I have not really enjoyed football as much as I want to. I have 
      access to satellite TV which regularly airs important international 
      matches, English league, Dutch and other European matches. However, I miss 
      quite a few of these due to working condition. Since my teen, I have 
      always found an affection with football statistics. Combined with my love 
      for computers, I have compiled the whole list of all matches played in 
      the World Cup since 1930 up to date. The records are perhaps not unique, 
      nor enterprising, but, I have not seen anything being produced that has 
      all the players and scorers name of every match. That is my drive 
      to eventually produce it and distribute it as 
shareware.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

    <TD colSpan=2>Soccer is from always in my skin. I played, managed and

      the work of the other. I made a book of the Biellese FC (the team of my 
      town), called «Football since 1902» and soon I will create a site of this 
      club. I'm not married and I live with my cat, called Maya (like the 
      heroine of «Space 1999»). She is black and white stripes, like the team 
      colours of Biellese (!). I play football in an Amateur team called «Bar 
      Cicala», in a little league, but at the moment I'm out for an accident 
      (reprise in February 1998, maybe). I like football historical and 
      statistical research, especially in the 20's and 30's. I studied for 
      waiter, but now I'm journalist (publicist) and I speak french (well) and 
      english (scholastic level). My interests are: beautiful girls (of course), 
      celtic folk music, literature (I'm a fan of some strange and genial 
      authors like Georges Perec and Arto Paasilinna) and good movies (no kind, 
      but everything give me a right message). I tourned around in Europe 
      (London, Côte d'Azur, Lyon, Barcelona, Copenaghen, Cologne, Malmö) and 
      America (Los Angeles) and my favourite place were I wish to go are:

    <TD colSpan=2>I have been fascinated with both numbers and football (as

stats was a logical hobby to take up.  During the beginning years this mostly
took the form of compiling all-time lists for European competitions and 
national championships, as well as organising my own fantasy leagues in
which my favourite (fantasy) clubs seldom failed to collect the silverware.  
It was triggered by discovering the sadly defunct Soccerinfo magazine in
the mid-eighties and, a couple of years later, the first European Football 
Yearbook (the 1988/89 edition published by the equally defunct Facer Books 
and covering the unforgettable 1987/88 season).  Gaining access to the 
rec.sport.soccer usenet group and getting into contact with similarly 
deformed minds like those of <A href="#aar">Lars Aarhus</a> and 
<A href="#hed">Kent Hedlundh</a> did the rest - (NE)RSSSF was born, as an
