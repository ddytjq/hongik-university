    <p align="left"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Yippyio was once
    considered a better horse than stablemate Might &amp; Power before cheating death and then
    becoming a public favourite due to his name and his courage as a racehorse. This is the
    story of his career. </font></strong></p>

  <tr>
    <td width="100%" colspan="2"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Yippyio was the
    first foal of Yodells (by Marscay) and was sired by Interstellar. Owned by his breeders
    Geoff &amp; Beryl White, Yippyio entered the stables of Alan Denham to be prepared for his
    racing career. Geoff and Beryl White are well known as the owners of such horses as the
    Golden Slipper winner Marscay, outstanding filly Triscay, Epsom winner and sire Filante
    and Yippyio.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">After foaling Yippyio
    Yodells then produced an unnamed foal before foaling Iglesia. Iglesia recently retired to
    stud in the spring of 2001 after breaking the track record in the 2001 Standish Hcp after
    previously winning at Group 2 level. Yodells fifth foal was the Caulfield winner Tyrolean
    while her next foal was the lightly raced 3yo Shantey. Yodells currently has a yearling by
    Danehill and is in foal to Fusaichi Pegasus.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">In August 1996 Yippyio was taken to the
    country NSW track of Muswellbrook for his first trial and ran 4th of eight with future
    talented sprinter Notoire taking the runner up position. Three months later he trialled
    again, this time at Rosehill, to finish third two lengths from the winner. All was ready
    for his racetrack debut and a fortnight later the big chestnut lined up in a 3yo Hcp at
    Randwick on the inner track. At 40-1 Yippyio was slowly away but by the post was in front
    by 3/4 of a length record a course record for the 1300m journey.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Ten days later he moved up to Saturday
    class in a 3yo race at his home track of Rosehill. Over 1500m Yippyio ran third to future
    group one winner Star Covet and Phantasia. Phantasia again had his measure by a half
    length at Randwick but Yippyio had excuses as he had struck interference as they jumped
    and was tightened during the race.</font></p>
    <p><img src="Yippyio1.jpg" alt="Yippyio1.jpg (17956 bytes)" align="right" border="1" hspace="10" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="229"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">His next start heralded the
    beginning of rise to stardom. Despite being slowly away and blundering near the 800m
    Yippyio easily defeated Sybeel over a mile at Randwick in record time before cruising home
    at Rosehill despite suffering interference in the run. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Given a break for three months Yippyio
    returned with a hard fought victory over giant galloper Holy Roller before heading to
    Brisbane for the winter carnival. In the Group 2 Queensland Guineas Yippyio pulled hard
    throughout but still came away to win by five lengths. Taking on the older horses he was
    7th in the Doomben Cup beaten just over 2 lengths before returning to 3yo class in the
    Queensland Derby. After a stirring battle with Marble Halls down the straight Yippyio
    proved stronger winning by a half length with six lengths to Summer Beau in third place.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Yippyio was then prepared for a tilt at the
    Melbourne Cup. First up he ran in the Tramway but was unplaced on the heavy track. In the
    Hill Stakes despite hanging out during the run he finished fourth behind Group 1 winners
    Ebony Grosve, Alfa and Sharscay. Yippyio then returned to his best in the Craven Plate
    winning by 3 1/2 lengths from Magic Of Sydney and Kassani with Ebony Grosve fourth. Jocky
    Jim Cassidy who rode both horses to this point declared that Yippyio was the pick over
    Might and Power from the yards of father son trainers Jack and Alan Denham.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Yippyio then headed to Melbourne to
    continue his campaign but disaster struck. On arriving in Melbourne Yippyio became unwell
    and was diagonosed with travel sickness. An illness that has claimed many horses in the
    past it looked as though Yippyio may succumb but he fought hard for his life and finally
    won the battle. While Yippyio was sick Might and Power went on to claim the status as the
    nation's superstar stayer winning both the Caulfield and Melbourne Cups.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Yippiyo returned to the racetrack in May
    1998. He was unplaced but then returned to Randwick two weeks later to win a similar race
    narrowly from Don Tristram. He was back but connections were not yet sure how much the
    illness had taken out of him. Many years before Bonecrusher had annihilated his opposition
    in 1986 then went to Japan and contracted travel sickness. He survived but was never the
    same horse. Races he would have won easily before illness he fought tooth and nail to
    scrape home. With Yippyio it was similar though he had returned to the winning lists he
    just didn't seem the same horse. Spelled for another four months Yippyio was set on a
    staying campaign for the Melbourne Cup. Unplaced first up Yippyio was second beaten
    narrowly in the Hill Stakes behind Arena and then was beaten a nose by Sharscay in the
    Craven Plate. The extra break seemed to have helped and Yippyio headed to Melbourne. After
    running unplaced in the Caulfield Cup he went straight into the Melbourne Cup but was
    again unplaced as lightweight mares Jezabeel and Champagne fought the race out. Yippyio
    again headed to the paddock with a brisbane campaign planned.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">First up Yippyio showed his zest for racing
    had returned with a fourth beaten less than a length behind in form Dibble's Dane and
    Final Forcast. He was then third in a Rosehill welter before heading north. Returning to
    his favourite northern track of Eagle Farm Yippiyo easily won the Listed Ramsey Health
    Hcp. Next he was a close fifth on a slow track in the Prime Ministers Cup at the Gold
    Coast behind Cronus.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">In the Doomben Cup Yippyio was checked at
    the 600m before being blocked for a run as Intergaze raced to victory from Lahar with
    Yippyio just over two lengths away in fifth. After running 6th in the Brisbane Cup Yippyio
    was given a break before a spring preparation.</font></p>
    <p><img src="Yippyio2.jpg" alt="Yippyio2.jpg (21717 bytes)" align="left" border="1" hspace="10" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="444"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">He returned with fifth placings in
    both the Group 3 Bill Ritchie Stakes and the Canberra Cup before heading to Doomben to
    record a hard fought win in the Lord Mayors Cup. Freshened up he was third in the
    Queensland Cup before returning to Sydney for the Christmas Cup. Yippyio ran second to in
    form galloper Pasta Express and then over raced when 9th in the Summer Cup. A week later
    he backed up in the Tatt's Club Cup to run second before a close 4th at Rosehill. Unplaced
    on Australia Day Yippyio returned to form with a half head second behind Morphy in the
    Underwood Cup. Freshened again he ran 4th in the Parramatta Cup and was given a further 5
    week break before preparing for a Queensland campaign. After a first up third Yippyio was
    unplaced in the Chairman's Hcp and Sydney Cup before arriving in Brisbane. He immediately
    returned to form with a short neck second in the Metropolitan Hcp then third in the PJ
    O'Shea Stakes only a length from the winner. His final run of the campaign was the
    Brisbane Cup where Yippyio showed the ability of his younger days streaking away to win
    easily from Sharscay and Karasi. Filling fourth place was Brew.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">On resuming in the spring Yippyio was set
    for a Cups campaign. Umplaced at his first two starts he proved too good for Pravda and
    Freemason in the Queens Cup and then headed to Melbourne finishing fourth in the Herbert
    Power Hcp. He then defeated a field of class stayers in the Moonee Valley Cup with Brew,
    Cronus and Bohemiath filling the placings behind him. In the Melbourne Cup Yippyio made a
    sustained run from the back on straightning and it was only Brew under the lightweight of
    49kg who he couldn't run down. Under 58kg Yippyio finished 2 lengths away in second with a
    further 1 1/2 lengths to Second Coming third. He may not have won but Yippyio's legion of
    fans were proud of the grand campaigner's achievement over a field of 20 other high class
    stayers.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">A spell following with the Brisbane winter
    his target. After two first up unplaced efforts in Sydney Yippyio returned to Doomben for
    the Labour Day Cup where the rejuvenated stayer Sky Heights was too good with Yippyio
    filling second but still four lengths ahead of the third placed horse. A fifth after
    trouble in running in the Prime Minister's Cup behind Inaflury followed before heading to
    Eagle Farm. Yippyio prevailed in a close finished in the O'Shea Stakes to win by a long
    head from Citi Habit with King Keitel third though the race was shrouded in sadness due to
    a horrific fall near the home turn. In the Brisbane Cup Yippyio was unable to conceed the
    difference in weight to the placegetters finishing 6th as Star Cover raced away from Citi
    Habit and Karasi with all placegetters carrying 50.5kg or less to Yippyio's 56kg.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">A break before another Melbourne Cup
    campaign. Unplaced over two short journeys Yippyio was then third in course record time in
    the Canberra Cup before heading to Melbourne for two runs. In the Moonee Valley Cup he
    showed his ability was still there in finishing hard as topweight to pass the post in
    fourth place in company with then Melbourne Cup favourite Big Pat. Despite his known
    staying ability Yippyio was only given a slight chance in the Melbourne Cup starting at
    16/1. The wide barrier and lack of luck in running on the dead track didn't help Yippyio
    and he passed the post well back as Ethereal was the only runner to make any considerable
    ground on the front runners just catching Give The Slip in the shadows of the post.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Yippyio was spelled and was in preparation
    for another autumn campaign when he joined a group of Group one performers to perform in
    exhibition gallops at the February 9th Rosehill meeting. After completing the course with
    Gillespie Yippyio stumbled and was quickly pulled up. It was originally thought that he
    had suffered a severe tendon injury and while his racing days were over that he could be
    saved for a well earned retirement. Sadly further examination on Sunday morning found that
    the injury was far worse and that Yippyio had fractured his sesamoid bones and nothing
    could be done to save him.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Yippiyo raced 59 times for 14 victories and
    15 placings earning $2,112,550. He could handle dry tracks and wet tracks but seemed to
    have trouble with dead rated tracks. He won from distances from 1300m to 3200m and while
    not ranked among the champions of the turf will be remembered as one of the greatest
    warriors of the era. He was destined to be one of the best before cheating death and then
    climbed his way back to be one of the best stayers at Group one level. </font></td>
