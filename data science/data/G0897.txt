<h1 align="center"><u>The Big Bang and the Expansion of the Universe</u></h1>
<p>
The universe we live in is expanding.  We know this because we see galaxies and
groups of galaxies steadily moving apart in the universe.  This expansion has 
been occuring since the universe was formed 15 billion years ago in a very hot, 
dense event known as the Big Bang.
</p>
<p>
Here are six Frequently Asked Questions about our expanding universe:
</p>

<p></p>
<h2>(1) Where is the center of the Universe?</h2>
<p>
There no centre of the universe because there is no edge of the universe.  In 
a finite universe, space is curved so that if you could travel billions of light 
years in a straight line you would eventually finish back where you started.  It
is also possible that our universe is infinite.  In both examples, groups of
galaxies completely fill the universe and are moving apart at all points making
the universe expand (see question 2).
</p>
<table align="center" width="640">
<tr><td align="center"><img src="tinyspace.gif" width="400" height="400" alt="A universe with no center or edge"/>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>An example of a <u>very small</u> universe containing only 48 stars.
A spaceship flying among these stars cannot find the edge of this universe.  If 
it exits on one side of the universe it reemerges on the other side.  The people 
in the spaceship see an infinite number of stars all around them.  This universe 
has no boundary and no centre.</td></tr>
</table>

<p></p>
<h2>(2) Where did the Big Bang occur in the Universe?</h2>
<p>There is a common assumption that the Big Bang was an explosion that occured in 
empty space and that the explosion expanded into the empty space.  This is wrong.
</p>
<table align="center" width="90%" bgcolor="#660000"><tr><td>
Space and time were created in the Big Bang. At the beginning of the universe 
the space was <u>completely</u> filled with matter.  The matter was originally 
very hot and very dense and then expanded and cooled to eventually produce the 
stars and galaxies we see in the universe today.
</td></tr></table>
<p>
Although space may have been concentrated into a single point at the Big Bang, it
is equally possible that space was infinite at the Big Bang.  In both scenarios the 
space was completely filled with matter which began to expand.

</table>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
There is no centre of the expansion, the universe is simply expanding at all points.
Observers in any galaxy see most of the other galaxies in the universe moving 
away from them.
</p>
<p>
The only answer to the question &quot;Where did the Big Bang happen?&quot; is that 
it occured everywhere in the Universe.
</p>

<p></p>
<h2>(3) Is the Earth expanding with the universe?</h2>
<p>
The Earth is not expanding and neither is the solar system, nor the Milky Way 
galaxy.  These objects formed under the influence of gravity and stopped moving
apart.  Gravity also holds galaxies together into groups and clusters.
It is mainly the groups and clusters of galaxies that are moving apart in the
universe.
</p>

<p></p>
<h2>(4) What exists outside the universe?</h2>
<p>
Space was created in the Big Bang.  Our universe has no edge or boundary - there 
is no 'outside' of our universe (see question 1).  It is possible that our universe 
is part of an infinity of universes (see question 5), but these universes do not 
necessarily need a 'space' to exist in.
</p>

<p></p>
<h2>(5) What existed before the Big Bang?</h2>
<p>
Time was created in the Big Bang - we do not know if it existed before the Big 
Bang.  This question is therefore hard to answer.  Some theories suggest that our 
universe is part of an infinity of universes (called a 'multiverse') which are being 
continuously created.  This is possible but very hard to prove.
</p>

<p></p>
<h2>(6) If the universe is 15 billion years old, how could
galaxies have travelled more than 15 billion light years?</h2>
<p>It is probable that our universe is infinite and has been filled with matter 
everywhere since the Big Bang (see question 2).  There is also good evidence that 
in the early universe that the universe may have expanded much faster than the 
speed of light.  It is possible to inflate space so that although particles are 
not travelling fast, the space between particles increases enormously.
</p>
<center><img src="spaceballs.gif" width="640" height="340" alt="rubber sheet space-time"/></center>
<p>
We can imagine galaxies are like balls sitting on a rubber sheet which represents
space.  If we stretch the sheet, the balls move apart.  Balls which are close 
together will only move apart slowly.  Balls which are widely separated will seem 
to move apart very quickly.  There is no limit on how fast space can expand.
</p>
<p>Space is the geometry of the universe.  Changes in the size or shape of space 
occur because of the movement of matter and energy in the universe or because of 
changes to the matter and energy content of the universe.
