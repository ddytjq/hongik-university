<p><strong>Bird Watching: On Playing and Coaching the Game I Love</strong></p>
<p><i>by Larry Bird and Jackie MacMullan</i></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 1</strong></p>
<p>On Retirement </p>
<p>On August 18, 1992, I announced my retirement from the Boston Celtics. It
was one of the happiest days of my life. </p>
<p>You have to understand how screwed up my back was at that point. I had been playing
through back problems for almost ten years, and I just couldn't take it
anymore. The pain was relentless. No matter what I did—whether I was standing
up, sitting down, lying down, leaning over—I couldn't escape it. It had
completely taken over my life. There were some days I couldn't even bend over
to pick up a basketball, never mind try to shoot one. Some nights, I had to eat
dinner sitting on the floor. Even lifting up my son, Conner, hurt so much that
I had to stop doing it. When I'm hurting, and not able to play the way I want,
I can be a pretty miserable person to be around. I don't know how my wife,
Dinah, lasted through that last season of my career, because I was in pain all
the time, which meant I was in a bad mood all the time too. </p>
<p>Maybe that's why when I walked up to the podium at my press conference in
the Boards and Blades Club at Boston Garden and finally said out loud that it
was over, I felt like the weight of the world had been lifted off my shoulders.
I can't tell you what a relief it was not to have to push myself through all
that pain anymore. </p>
<p>I can honestly say I hated basketball at that point.</p>
<p>As soon as that press conference was over, me and some of my good friends,
including my physical therapist, Dan Dyrek, went out and celebrated. There was
nothing to be sad or sentimental about. It was time for me to be done. I had
known for months before the actual press conference that I wasn't going to play
anymore. When my back started flaring up in training camp, before the start of
the 1991-92 season, I knew that was probably it, but I don't think I actually
admitted it to anyone—probably not even to myself, really—until January or
February of 1992. I wasn't afraid of life after basketball. It was more a
matter of finishing a job. I don't believe in giving up in the middle of
anything. But it really wears you out when you are in constant pain. I had what
they call a nerve impingement, which meant the L-4 vertebra was sitting twisted
and compressed on the L-5 vertebra, and there was a nerve trapped in between
the two. It left my spine very unstable. The bone kept pushing itself into the
nerves in my back, and it was just terrible. Dan Dyrek would work on it so he
could temporarily push the bone off the nerve, but before long I'd be feeling
that burning pain shooting down my leg, and I'd be in serious trouble all over
again.</p>
<p>By this time Dan had been treating me for almost a decade, and he was really
concerned about the permanent damage I might be doing to myself. There were a
whole bunch of times we had serious discussions about retirement. We came to a
compromise, and worked out a system where we'd make decisions from game to
game. Dan would examine me, and if my back was really &quot;hot,&quot; or
agitated where the disc was, he would tell me I had to sit out. If Dan gave me
a thumbs-down, that was the final word for that night. Neither the Celtics nor
I questioned him—most of the time. Looking back, it was a ridiculous way to
finish my career, but at the time I just put my head down and tried to get
through it.</p>
<p>I missed 37 games in my final season. People knew I was hurting, but very
few of them had any idea how bad it really was. It got to the point where I was
wearing a brace almost all the time except when I was practicing or playing. I
even had to wear it to bed. I really hated that brace. It was made of a
quarter-inch of fiberglass and went from my chest all the way down to my hips,
and it was really uncomfortable. But I knew it was necessary. One thing is for
sure: I wasn't going out much at that point. I didn't want anyone to see me in
that thing.</p>

<p>The day I finally didn't need that brace anymore, I took it outside and
destroyed it.</p>

<p>Even though I knew I was playing my last season, I kept it to myself. The
last thing I wanted or needed was a big commotion at every city we went to. I
had no interest in a retirement tour. Our team was still pretty competitive at
that point and that's all I wanted to concentrate on, getting as deep as we
could into the playoffs and, if we caught a break or two, maybe into the
Finals. Of course the media was speculating on how much longer I'd play, but I
wasn't saying a word.</p>

<p>Well, not publicly anyway. I do remember walking into Dan's office early in
1992 and telling him, &quot;Dan, the back is really bad. Just get me through
this season and I'll quit.&quot;</p>

<p>Dan said what he had been saying for over a year: &quot;Larry, you should
quit right now. Your back is unstable. Every day you go out there, you are
risking further damage. It's over. You have to stop playing.&quot;</p>

<p>I knew Dan was right, but I couldn't see quitting in the middle of the
season. I promised myself I wouldn't do that, because people had bought season
tickets that year thinking they were going to see me play. Most of them knew my
back was bad and I might miss some games, but they were counting on seeing me
at least some of the time, and I didn't want to let them down.</p>

<p>For the rest of the season I lived on anti-inflammatory drugs and wore that
stupid brace. Both Dan and the Celtics trainer, Ed Lacerte, did the best they
could to hold me together. It seemed we'd be talking every two weeks or so
about retiring, but then I'd have a period of ten days or so where I felt okay,
and that would be the end of it. Then, like it always did, the pain would come
back. Both Dan Dyrek and Ed Lacerte have told me I played that last season in a
state of unconsciousness.</p>

<p>The truth is, I should have retired a couple of years earlier, after I had
my first back surgery in the summer of 1991. We had played Indiana in the first
round of the playoffs that spring, and I was in really bad shape. The burning
down my leg was so bad I couldn't feel my toes. I couldn't sit down, I couldn't
stand up. I was in shock, really, but how could I stop in the middle of the
playoffs? I remember after we lost Game 4 in Market Square Arena, it was about
the worst I had ever felt. I wanted so badly to be healthy, because we had to
go back to Boston for a deciding Game 5, and there was no way I could let that
team beat us, because I didn't want to hear about it all summer from my friends
who lived in Indiana.</p>

<p>I went to see Dan, and he started feeling around, and he said, &quot;There's
nothing more I can do for you.&quot; I left his office thinking, &quot;Boy,
this really is it.&quot; I got in the car and started driving, but the pain was
so intense that I had to stop after about a mile and get out and walk around.</p>

<p>Somehow I managed to play Game 5 at the Garden. A lot of times I would feel
lousy heading into the game, but after Dan worked on me a bit, and all my
adrenaline got pumping, I could block it out. I knew I'd pay for it later, but
that was later. We beat the Pacers in Game 5 and won the series, but not before
I banged my head on the parquet floor chasing after a loose ball. I don't
remember much of it, to be honest, because when they took me into the locker
room I was in a daze. But I do remember one thing: after all I had been through
with my back, no lump on the head was going to keep me out of the playoffs. I
remember sitting in the locker room with our team doctor, Arnie Scheller, and
after my head started clearing a little bit, I said to him, &quot;Do I have a
shot? Can I get back in there?&quot; He said, &quot;Hey, you've done enough.
That's it for you.&quot; So we sit in that training room some more, and I keep
hearing the crowd. They're chanting, &quot;Lar-ry! Lar-ry!&quot; I look at
Arnie, and I said, &quot;Aw, hell!&quot; and I get up, I run through that
tunnel, back onto the court, and the place goes absolutely nuts. Later, when I
got hired by the Pacers, Donnie Walsh said he knew I would play. He said he
knew I'd come back, and the place would go crazy, and we'd win the game, which
is exactly what happened. Even so, we couldn't sustain the momentum. We ended
up losing to Detroit in six games in the next round, and a couple months after
that I had my first back surgery.</p>

<p>The procedure involved shaving the disc, as well as widening the canal where
the nerves that led to my spinal cord sat. I knew the surgery was not going to
solve all my problems. In fact, the pain was back within a couple months.
Fusion surgery had been an option, but the surgeons warned me that very few
professional athletes had ever played again following fusion surgery, and I
wasn't interested in being a guinea pig. The truth? I was just trying to buy
myself some time.</p>

<p>The same day I had my first surgery, I went out and walked ten miles. My
surgeon was very optimistic. He said, &quot;You should come back in January and
I'll take another look, but I think you are going to do just fine.&quot; Well,
Arnie brought the surgeon to one of our first games of the season. This doc
knows nothing about basketball—he's an old hockey player. He came in after the
game and he said to me, &quot;Larry, the way you play this game, you're not
going to last another month. I had no idea you did all this stuff. Hell, you
don't spend any time on your feet.&quot; He looked kind of worried, but I
didn't pay much attention. I was feeling great!</p>

<p>At the time, we were 28-5, and on our way to the best record in the East at
the All-Star break. Not very long after that, I was shooting around before the
game, and I turned a little funny, and boom! There goes my back. I couldn't
believe it. I knew right then that was the end of it. I was in and out the rest
of the season.</p>

<p>Once I realized my back was still going to mess me up no matter what, I seriously
considered retiring right then and there. Dave Gavitt, who had come to the
Celtics in 1990 to run the team, kept talking me out of it. Not too many people
can change my thinking when my mind is made up about something, but Dave was
different. We hit it off from the first day we met. Dave had a lot of
innovative ideas about how to help the team, and I loved talking about
basketball with him. You can tell he was a former coach—he had some really good
Providence teams back in the seventies—because of how he approached people. He
understood how a player saw the game, and understood that a team needed to have
an identity, and that whatever went on in the locker room, or on the floor, was
something that should be shared among each other, like a family.</p>

<p>I was really excited when Gavitt took over as the team's CEO. We needed
someone with his basketball expertise making personnel decisions. I was sure
he'd be the one that would win us our next championship—until my back
interfered.</p>

<p>I went into Dave's office about four months after my first back surgery and
told him, &quot;Dave, I don't think I can go on like this. I'm not the same
player I was. I can't play the way I want to anymore, and I'm thinking I should
retire.&quot; He put his arm on my shoulder and said, &quot;Larry, I didn't
come here to throw you a retirement party. I came here to help you win a
championship.&quot; He gave me a little pep talk about how special our team
was, and how the NBA would probably never see another front line like me, Kevin
McHale, and Robert Parish again, and then he got into the whole thing about the
Celtics tradition and what it meant to the city of Boston, which was why he had
given up his job as commissioner of the Big East to take over the Celtics. I'm
telling you, Dave was a pretty persuasive guy. He could get you all fired up. I
knew he would back me up, whatever I decided, and I guess I didn't want to let
him down. Besides, I agreed with him on one thing: we still had a chance to win
a championship. As long as we still had a crack at that, it was going to be
hard—impossible, really—for me to give up playing.</p>

<p>The last championship we won was in 1986. It was a dream season. Everybody
played at the top of their games—me, Robert, Kevin, Dennis Johnson, Danny
Ainge—and we had a great bench. We also had the two best centers in the league.
That was the year Bill Walton played with us, and he was just phenomenal. He is
the best passing big man I've ever seen, and I marveled at the things he could
do, even though his feet were a mess and he wasn't anywhere near the player he
had once been. That didn't matter on our team. Bill did what he could do, and
that was more than enough. But what people tend to forget is that one of the
big reasons Walton was able to have that kind of success was because of Robert
Parish. Robert was an All-Star center, and he started every game, but there
were many times when it was Walton, not Parish, who was on the floor in the
fourth quarter. On a different team, with a different guy, that could have
caused all sorts of problems. Some players get really protective about minutes,
or when they are on the court and how much credit they're given, but not
Robert. He was a true pro. He really didn't care how much he played, or when,
as long as it worked for the team. That's why that year was so great, because
it was all about winning. I'm sure there were some days that Robert wished he
was out there, but he would never have said so. I'm sure, also, there were
times Robert got tired of all the media attention Bill got—and believe me, it
was a lot, which I appreciated, because it took some of the spotlight away from
me—but in the end, Robert knew his team respected him, and that's all that
really mattered.</p>

<p>Those are the kind of things I told my Indiana team when I took the Pacers
job. Never mind what the outside world thinks—what do the guys who are on the
court with you, day after day, think? Because they are the ones who know
whether or not you've given them everything you have. I used to laugh when I
read things in the paper about how important this guy was to our team, or how
that guy wasn't helping us. Because many times they had it all wrong. Take Greg
Kite. He was a center from Brigham Young who got drafted by the Celtics in
1983, and Bob Ryan, a sportswriter for the <em>Boston Globe</em>, was
constantly killing him. He'd say things like, &quot;He's a twelfth man that
doesn't belong in the league, this and that,&quot; but what people don't
understand is that most fans only see the games. They don't see practice. I
always thought the practices were so important—I still believe that—to prepare
other guys to play. That's why our 1986 team was so successful. We had Walton
going against Parish every day. We had Scottie Wedman going against me for a
number of years, pushing me every day. To the second unit, those practices were
their games, especially to a guy like Kite who didn't play much. He wanted to
beat us every day in practice. He never took a day off. He couldn't afford to.
He was excellent for our team. He was a smart player, he knew everything we were
doing, and he understood exactly what his role was. I wish I could find me a
Greg Kite right now for the Pacers.</p>

<p>After that 1986 championship, everything fell apart. Walton stuck around
another season, but he was hurt almost all of it, and he retired after playing
only ten games in 1987. The Celtics drafted Len Bias that spring, and he died
of a cocaine overdose. That was a real shock. I was taking a shower, and my mom
came in and told me. I thought it was somebody's idea of a cruel joke. Then
Kevin hurt his foot the next season, and by the time we got to the Finals
against the Lakers, he was playing on a broken foot. It just seemed like we
couldn't catch a break.</p>

<p>Just before the 1988-89 season, both of my heels started really bothering
me. This wasn't a new injury. I had always had some pain down there. Dan said
it didn't help matters that I never stretched those Achilles tendons. He also
said there had been some inflammation in that area for some time. But what took
this pain to an unbearable level was that, over time, with repeated trauma to
that area, I developed bone mass in both heels. There shouldn't be any bone
anywhere near there, and it was embedded in the tendon. I tried to play through
it, but it wasn't going to happen, so they decided to do surgery on both heels
and take all that bone out. Dan was against the surgery. He thought he could
treat me without it, but I wanted the pain to stop. I told him, &quot;Let's
just get the stuff out of there and worry about the rest of it later.&quot;
Originally the doctors said I would miss about three months, but I ended up
missing the whole season. I was miserable. It's no fun watching your team
struggle while you're sitting there on the bench in street clothes.</p>

<p>When I started my rehab that summer I knew I would never be the same. My
legs felt different. The surgery took all the life out of them. I did all the
exercises and all the workouts they gave me, but I couldn't move the way I used
to. I could still score and rebound and all that, but defensively it really affected
me. I didn't have the same lift, or side-to-side movement. It was very, very
frustrating, but there wasn't much use in talking about it. I could either play
on or give it up, and I figured I had a lot more playing to do.</p>

<p>Of course, that was before I had any real idea of how bad my back would get.
I guess I should have known. The doctors had told me I had congenital problems.
I was born with a narrower canal than normal where the nerves lead to the
spinal cord. Then there are the joints in my back, called the facet joints.
They are supposed to be aligned a certain way. The left and right joints should
be parallel to each other, but the ones on my right side were at all sorts of
different angles. What all of this meant was my disc was going to slowly break
down over the course of my life. Dan says I would have had back problems
whether I was a professional athlete or not. Just through the wear and tear of
every day, my spinal area was deteriorating, and the disc was degenerating. And
the worse that disc got, the more excessive motion it caused in my back. That
created a wobbly area that had very little stability.</p>

<p>All of that may have been true, but when you are a kid running around
playing basketball and baseball and everything else, you don't want to know that
stuff. I didn't have any major injuries as a kid growing up, unless you count a
broken ankle that I got playing basketball. I had no way of knowing my back was
going to give out on me.</p>

<p>My first real back problems cropped up in 1983, when I went home to my house
in French Lick for the summer to do some work on my property. One of the first
things I wanted to get done was to install some tile around my basketball
court, to help with the drainage. I was never much on hiring people to do work
I was perfectly capable of doing myself, and this job shouldn't have been a
problem. I needed some gravel to seal it, so I got my brother and his friend
Eddie to help me spread it. They weren't doing it the way I wanted, so I said
the heck with it, and I took that truck full of gravel and did it all myself.
It wasn't the best idea I ever had. I woke up the next morning and I said,
&quot;Something is wrong.&quot; My back was killing me. I couldn't walk around,
much less work out, and I was worried. I had only been with the Celtics for
four seasons at that point, and we had already won our first championship, but
I knew that if we were ever going to win another one I was going to have to be
even better than I was the year before.</p>

<p>I didn't want to have to tell the team I was hurt, so I didn't do anything
for about two or three weeks, hoping the rest would make it all better. But by
then it was July, and I knew I had to get moving with my conditioning and
everything for the season, so I called the Celtics team doctor, Tom Silva, and told
him what had happened. He told me to put lots of ice on it. I did that for the
rest of the summer, but it wasn't helping much.</p>

<p>I remember really suffering through training camp. Doc Silva would alternate
with heat and ice, heat and ice, but it wasn't working. I remember after we
played Philadelphia in an exhibition game at home, the pain was so bad I went
to Silva again and said, &quot;We've got to try something else.&quot; He said,
&quot;Larry, I don't know what else to tell you.&quot; He called in Dr. Robert
Leach, who examined me, then recommended I be seen by this physical therapist,
Dan Dyrek, who he thought could help me. I agreed to see Dyrek at my house the
next day.</p>

<p>He examined me in my living room, with Doc Leach and our trainer, Ray
Melchiorre, watching. He was twisting me this way and that way, and digging
into certain areas of my back, and everything he did hurt a whole lot. He
explained what he was doing as he went along, and I was listening to everything
he said, but I kept looking at Ray and Leach, because I knew them, and I wasn't
sure what the hell was going on. I was only twenty-six years old, and I didn't
like the looks on their faces.</p>

<p>My first impression of Dan was pretty good. At least he wasn't telling me I
needed heat and ice, heat and ice, because it was pretty obvious that wasn't
going to work. I remember about an hour after they all left, I got up to turn
on a light, and they were all standing in my driveway, still talking. I went
back and told Dinah, &quot;They're still out there. You know what that means.
My back must be pretty screwed up.&quot;</p>

<p>Dyrek called me the next morning and explained that there was what he called
a real &quot;hot spot&quot; in my back around the disc that he wanted to treat
by mobilizing the tissues and tendons around that area. The idea was to manually
manipulate that area to restore normal motion and take pressure off the disc. I
said, &quot;Let's start today.&quot;</p>

<p>That's how my relationship with Dan Dyrek came about. It started out as
professional, but he's become one of my close friends. When you spend that much
time with somebody, you find out what kind of person they are, and Dan was
always a professional. I never worried that he would be talking to anyone about
my treatments. And I could tell early on he knew what he was doing. When I
first started seeing him, I was getting these major pains in my side that would
last for more than ten seconds when I sat down. It was brutal. But after two or
three weeks of seeing Dan, that pain gradually started going away. I ended up
receiving treatment every other day for two years.</p>

<p>A couple of months after he started helping me, I offered Dan a couple of my
tickets to a Celtics game. I knew he'd never ask for anything. I didn't even
know if he was a sports fan until I saw his face when I gave him the tickets.
He looked so excited, and surprised. I'm not the type to just go out and give
my tickets to anyone, but I really appreciated how much Dan was helping me. So
I gave him two tickets to each game for the rest of the season. We spent so
much time together that our pregame treatments turned into little challenges.
Just before it was time to take the court, Dan would ask, &quot;How are you
doing?&quot; and I'd say, &quot;I'm feeling like I can score forty-three points
tonight.&quot; If I actually got to 43 points, we'd have some kind of prearranged
signal, like a salute, and I'd turn and give it to him.</p>

<p>It was really important that I could trust Dan not to discuss my injuries. I
didn't want the fans and the media to know every little thing that was wrong
with me, but even more important, I didn't want the teams we were playing
against to know! That's why nobody knew about the neck problems I was having
about this same time. But that was nothing compared to my back. My next serious
back episode was in the summer before the 1989-90 season, when I went to a fund
raiser that the singer Kenny Rogers put on each year. I love Kenny Rogers's
music, and I had been doing his charity event for three years or so and it was
a lot of fun. He got four pro basketball players, four fishermen, four tennis players,
and four golfers, and we all tried to play one another's sports. I was still
having some trouble with my back, but Dan had gotten me to the point where I
had long stretches of being pain free. I was feeling pretty good about the
upcoming season.</p>

<p>We were in the final minutes of this charity basketball game when I went up
for a rebound and came down a little sideways. Michael Jordan was going for the
ball too, and he landed on my back. Right away I knew I was in trouble. My back
started tightening up, and I could feel the pain coming on. The game was almost
over, which was a good thing, because I was done. I just kind of stood there
until it ended, and then I walked off the court without telling anybody what
had just happened. Dinah was there with me, and she got on the phone to Dan and
told him we needed to come up to Boston to see him. It was awkward, because the
fund-raising people kept asking me to play tennis, but I couldn't, and I really
didn't feel like explaining why.</p>

<p>Within a couple of days we were in Dan's office, and I could tell right away
the news wasn't good. I had torn additional portions of the disc wall, and my
back was really traumatized. I didn't know it then, all the way back in 1989,
but that was the beginning of the end. Dan was able to treat me so I got better
and was able to play, but I never came all the way back. For the rest of my
career I had to rely on Dan to continually treat me and put things back in
their proper place. We told the Celtics what had happened. They took it pretty
well. The truth was, my back was so unstable, it was going to give way
sometime. It wasn't like it was this violent collision; Michael didn't even
land on me that hard. I was just at the point where I was an accident waiting to
happen.</p>

<p>Nobody ever found out about that charity game—until now—which was good.
There was nothing I hated more than talking about my injuries. It never helped
them feel any better, and to me it always sounded like an excuse. Also, I found
myself getting kind of superstitious. I remember one time, I had just finished
practice at Hellenic College, which is where the Celtics used to hold all their
workouts, and I was feeling fantastic. Peter May, a reporter who covered our
team for many years, asked me how my back was feeling. I answered him,
&quot;Great!&quot; I drove home from practice, lay down to take a nap, and I
woke up with that horrible burning pain down my leg again. The next day, I was
at the hospital getting injections. That's when I decided, &quot;That's it. I'm
not talking about my injuries anymore.&quot; I know it was hard for the
reporters covering the team, but they got used to it. They knew that if I was
cranky, it meant something was hurting. Near the end, that was every day.</p>

<p>It was just a grueling process. Dan would check my back to see if it had
lost its alignment, because things were so unstable, the bones were prone to
shifting, and that set off all sorts of spasms. But the worst part about it was
that my back prevented me from practicing, and without all that time in the
gym, my skills were deteriorating. I loved to practice, and I needed to
practice, and my game really suffered when I didn't.</p>

<p>That played a part in my decision to retire too.</p>

<p>My last game at Boston Garden was on May 15, 1992. We had beaten the Pacers
3-0 in the opening round of the playoffs and had Cleveland next. The Cavs were
a good team, and had us down 3-2 heading into Game 6. It wasn't a memorable
performance for me. I remember feeling a little off balance all night. My shot
didn't feel the way I wanted it to feel, and everything was a little out of
sync. But Reggie Lewis hit some foul shots at the end, and we won to tie the
series 3-3. I wasn't thinking it was the last time I'd play in the Garden,
because I truly believed we were going to beat Cleveland and come back home for
the next round. But that didn't happen. The Cavaliers beat us at their
place,and then—boom!—all of a sudden the season was over, and so was my career
with the Celtics...</p>

<p>I hadn't told any of my teammates I was done, so there weren't any hugs or
handshakes or anything like that. I'm sure some guys suspected, but nobody said
anything. I just grabbed the game ball, stuffed it in my bag, and went home.</p>

<p>The official announcement didn't come for about another three months, because
I had to play for the United States in the Olympics in Barcelona. When we
decided it was time to let everyone know I was retiring, we called up everyone
that morning and told them. I didn't want it to get leaked out ahead of time
and have people camping out in front of the house. Better to get it over with
all at once. Dinah decided to go back to Indiana. There was something going on
in French Lick, and I think she really didn't want to be around to see it end.
I remember she called me the night after the press conference and said she was
getting her hair done at the beauty shop when the announcement came on over the
radio. She said it got her all teary-eyed and everything. It was a big change
for both of us. We had gone through all this pain and sweat, and now all of a
sudden it was going to be over.</p>

<p>There were a lot of reporters at the press conference, even though we hadn't
given them much advance notice. They wanted to know how I had spent the
previous night preparing for the announcement. I told them I sat in my house in
Brookline by myself, and watched old tapes of myself and cried. But that was
crap, of course. I don't know why I said it. It just came out, and it sounded
good. I remember I did sit home and I started thinking about it, and said to
myself, &quot;My God, this is really over. I'm really out of here.&quot; Then I
started thinking back to when I first got there, and how I went in and saw the
house that I really liked, and how much fun we had in that house, and then I
started going through in my mind everything that happened during those thirteen
years. More than anything, I was so thankful to have played in one place my
entire career. That's something I believe is truly special, and I'm so glad it
was with the Boston Celtics. I used to tell people, if you haven't played for
the Boston Celtics, you haven't played professional basketball. I suppose
that's a little bit of bull too, but it felt that way to me. I never tried to
imagine wearing another uniform, because I couldn't have. I would have retired
first.</p>

<p>Some of my friends think it's too bad the fans didn't know which one was my
final game, because they didn't get to say goodbye, but they did. The Celtics
held a retirement night for me, and it was one of the greatest things I've ever
experienced. It was Dave Gavitt's idea. At first I didn't want any part of it.
The way the Celtics usually retire jerseys is at halftime of a game, but Dave
said it would be almost impossible to get the ceremony done in such a short
time, and it would be disruptive to the game. His idea was to sell tickets to a
Larry Bird Night, and donate all the proceeds to charity. The way he envisioned
it was to have me onstage, in uniform, and have various people who were
important throughout my career come up and talk with me. He also wanted to fly
in Magic Johnson from L.A. to be there, which I thought was a great idea,
because the two of us were so closely connected throughout our careers. Dave
thought Magic should be in his Lakers warmups, and I should be in my Celtics
warmups. I fought him a little on that, but I finally gave in. Dave also
thought I should take one last shot, but there was no way I'd agree to that. I
told him, &quot;Dave, I've already taken all the shots I'm going to take.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyhow, once I said yes to this Larry Bird Night, I got concerned about it.
Who would come? There wasn't any game being played. But once it was announced,
it sold out in a matter of minutes. Everyone got pretty excited about it. Mark
Lev, who worked in the marketing department for Boston, came up with the idea
of selling 1,033 limited edition Leroy Neiman prints, signed by both Neiman and
me, for $1,033 each, with that money going to charity as well. (The additional
33 was for my uniform number.)</p>

<p>The night itself is one I'll never forget. I still can't get over all those
people showing up, just to cheer for me. When they cheer for you in a game, you
never know if it's because of the play the whole team just made, or because
they love the Celtics, or what. But that night, I really appreciated their applause.
Bob Costas, who agreed to fly in and be the emcee at no charge, was great.
Magic was his usual charming self. My mom made a rare appearance in Boston to
attend, and my son, Conner, who was just a baby, helped me raise my number to
the rafters.</p>

<p>We raised over $1 million for thirty-three different charities. We gave
money to everyone from Celtics Wives Save Lives (to benefit breast cancer
research) to Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children. It wasn't easy choosing
where the money should go, because there were so many worthy causes. I remember
that at the time, Conner loved the show <em>Barney</em>, so I asked that we
give something to the public television station that aired it. I wanted to make
a donation to the Colonel Daniel Marr Boys and Girls Club, because I had seen
for myself all the good they had done, and I wanted to make sure we gave a new
van to a homeless shelter in town called Rosie's Place. Some of the donations
involved personal connections too. We gave money to an Alzheimer's foundation
named after M. L. Carr's father, who died of the disease, as well as to the Red
Auerbach Youth Foundation. I also wanted New England Baptist Hospital, whose
staff had taken care of me all those years, to receive a donation.</p>

<p>People ask me all the time if I regret playing through all that pain, and if
I would do it over again, knowing what I know now. When I list all of the
things that went wrong with my body, it sounds like I'm whining about my
injuries, and I hate that. That's why you didn't hear me talking about them
when I was playing. It was the last thing I wanted to talk about.</p>

<p>I will say this: I should have retired after my first back surgery. I wish I
had. But the mentality of our team was to play through anything, to do whatever
it takes, and most of us did that. Like when Kevin had that broken foot. We
knew it was bad, and if he had decided he couldn't play, we would have lived
with it. We would have understood. But the truth is, we all knew Kevin wasn't
going to sit, because he knew we had a chance at a championship that season,
and those chances don't come too often. I'm sure McHale has some regrets. We
lost to the Lakers in the Finals in 1987, and from what I understand, all these
years later that foot still gives Kevin some trouble. You hate to hear that.</p>

<p>I think one of the problems with our league today is that guys will sit out
more now if they're injured because they don't want to ruin their reputation of
being a great player, and it's hard to perform at your top level when you're
injured. The other thing is that guys whose contracts are up figure they stand
to make a lot of money, so why push it if you don't have to? Then there's the
agents. These young kids are letting other people make their decisions for
them, and that's too bad. A kid like Marcus Camby, he's got all this talent,
but he's hurt so much it doesn't matter. You feel like telling him that if he
tries to play through some of the nagging injuries he might actually feel
better. I played some of my best games when I had a muscle pull or I was sick.
You come in that night figuring you can't feel any worse, and when you finally
get out there and run around a little bit, you tend to forget about what was
bothering you.</p>

<p>One thing I've tried to understand as a coach, though, is that everyone
handles pain differently. Some people know how to play through it. Others just
can't. You have to be realistic. I like to see guys play through twisted
ankles, stuff like that. When it gets to more serious injuries, though, only
you can decide how far you want to push yourself. My whole thing is, if you
don't think you can play, then don't. And if you can, then go out there and do
it, but don't spend a whole lot of time talking about it. Nobody else knows
your pain threshold but you. Sometimes I'd complain privately to Dan Dyrek and
say, &quot;Why isn't this guy playing tonight? We could use him.&quot; But Dan
would always tell me, &quot;Larry, you have an unbelievably high threshold of
pain. You can't expect other people to have that same threshold, because they
don't. It's not fair to question how much people are willing or able to put
themselves through. That's just not fair.&quot; I've tried to remember that in
dealing with my own players.</p>

<p>So was all that suffering worth it? When you look around Boston Garden and
see 15,000 people there, then it's worth every minute. I loved looking around
and seeing every seat filled. That's a special feeling I'll never forget.</p>

<p>There are some other things I would rather forget. A few years after I
retired, I was in Boston with a friend of mine who was having back trouble, and
I called up Dan Dyrek and asked him if he could take a look at him. Dan's
offices were in a new place, but even so, the minute I walked in there and
started remembering all the pain I had gone through, I felt sick. Dan looked at
me and said, &quot;Larry, you look pale. Are you all right?&quot; I took one
look around and answered, &quot;As long as I never have to come back here, I'll
be fine.&quot;</p>
