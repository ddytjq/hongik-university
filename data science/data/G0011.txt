<title>Low Density Universes and Inflation</title>

<h1 align=center>
Low Density Inflationary Universes 
</h1>

<h2>
How Much Matter Does the Universe Contain?
</h2>

<p>
An important question today in cosmology is how much mass
is contained in the universe. If there were no matter filling
the universe, the universe would expand forever and the 
recession velocity of objects at rest with respect to the 
expansion of the universe would not change as the universe expands. 
</p>

<p>
We know, of course, that the universe is not empty but filled
with matter, and ordinary matter through gravity attracts other
matter, causing the expansion of the universe to slow down. 
If the density of the universe exceeds a certain threshold 
known as the critical density, this gravitational attraction
is strong enough to stop and later reverse the expansion
of the universe, causing it eventually 
to recollapse in what is known as
the "Big Crunch." On the other hand, if the average density
of the Universe falls short of the critical density, the 
universe expands forever, and after a certain point the 
expansion proceeds much as if the universe were empty. 
A critical universe lies precariously
balanced between these two possibilities. 
</p>

<h2>
Why a Universe of Critical Density?
</h2>

<p>
For quite some time it has been known that the mean density of
our universe agrees with the critical density to within better than a 
factor of ten. Even with such large margin of error this agreement 
is remarkable. Establishing initial conditions so that the mean 
density remains close to the critical density for more than a 
fleeting moment is much like trying to balance a 
pencil on its point.
A universe initially with slightly subcritical density 
rapidly becomes increasingly subcritical and soon virtually
indistinguishable from an empty universe. Similarly, an 
ever so slightly supercritical universe rapidly 
collapses into a Big Crunch, never reaching the old
age of our universe---somewhere around twelve billion years.
To obtain a universe like ours seems to require fine
tuning of the initial density to agree with the 
critical density to an accuracy around one part in 
10<sup>60</sup>!
</p>

<p>
For a long time it was regarded simplest and 
aesthetically most pleasing to postulate that our
universe is now of exactly critical density. The versions
of inflation developed in the early 1980s provided a
mechanism for setting the density of the universe near the 
critical density with nearly unlimited precision. 
For many years an exactly critical universe was touted
as one of the few firm predictions of inflation. 
</p>

<h2>
Geometry and the Density of the Universe
</h2>

<p>
In Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, formulated
in 1915, gravity is understood in terms of 
geometry rather than as just another ordinary force. Matter
tells spacetime how to curve and the resulting spacetime 
curvature tells bodies how to 
move. For the special case of an expanding universe,
idealized as filled with a uniform density of
matter, a good approximation on large scales,
General Relativity establishes an intimate
connection between the density of the universe 
in comparison with the critical density and its geometry.
A universe of critical density
(at constant cosmic time) has the familiar
Euclidean geometry so well known to us 
from every experience and from classical perspective
as taught in art class. 
However, a universe of subcritical or
supercritical density has a non-Euclidean
geometry---hyperbolic if the density is subcritical, 
or spherical if the density is supercritical. 
</p>

<p>
On small scales these different geometries are much alike.
An ant on the surface of an apple might view its
immediate surrounding as quite flat and might experience 
difficulty in figuring out that the apple is round. 
Likewise, if the curvature of the universe would 
become apparent only on scales beyond several billion
light years we might be deceived into believing that
its geometry is Euclidean. Only on large scales---larger
than the so-called curvature scale---do the 
differences between the geometries become large effects.
</p>

<p>
The following three plates illustrate the difference in
perspective between the three possible geometries:
a hyperbolic geometry, a Euclidean geometry, and a 
spherical geometry. 
In all three cases, space is divided into identical
cells, whose edges are indicated by the rods. The balls
within the cells are of identical size, and increasing
distance is indicated by reddening. 
</p>

<center>
<IMG SRC="images/flat.gif" ALIGN=CENTER>
<br>
</center>

<p>
In the Euclidean geometry space is divided into cubes
and one experiences the ordinary, familiar 
perspective: the apparent
angular size of objects is proportional to the inverse of
their distance. 
</p>

<center>
<IMG SRC="images/hyp.gif" ALIGN=CENTER>
<br>
</center>

<p>
Hyperbolic space shown here is tiled with 
regular dodecahedra. 
In Euclidean space such a regular tiling is impossible. 
The size of the cells is of the same order as the 
curvature scale. Although perspective for nearby 
objects in hyperbolic space is very nearly identical to
Euclidean space, the apparent angular
size of distant objects falls off much more
rapidly, in fact exponentially,
as can be seen in the figure.
</p>

<center>
<IMG SRC="images/sph.gif" ALIGN=CENTER>
<br>
</center>


<p>
The spherical space space shown here is tiled with 
regular dodecahedra. The geometry of spherical space
resembles the surface of the earth 
except here a three-dimensional rather than 
two-dimensional sphere is being considered. 
Perspective in spherical space is peculiar.
Increasingly distant objects first become smaller
(as in Euclidean space), reach a minimum size,
and finally become larger with increasing distance.
This behavior is due to the focusing nature of the 
spherical geometry.

<h2>
What is the Geometry of Our Universe?
</h2>

<p>
During the 1980s observations remained sufficiently crude 
so that a universe of critical density was quite plausible.
But more recent observations have made it increasingly
difficult to reconcile a critical universe with the 
observations. 
</p>

<p>
It is known that in addition to the luminous matter seen 
in the form of stars the universe contains a large amount
of "dark" matter, in particular in the halos around galaxies.
The presence of this dark matter is inferred from its 
gravitational pull on the surrounding matter. Since the 
dark matter is distributed in a less clustered manner
than the luminous
matter, the apparent average density seems to increase as 
larger and larger scales are probed. For a long time it was hoped
probing sufficiently large scales would uncover a critical density
of dark matter.
</p>

<p>
Today it seems unlikely that this hope will ever be realized.
It is now possible to probe the average density of the universe
on scales large enough to compromise a fair sample of the 
universe. We present the so-called "cluster baryon fraction" as one 
illustrative example of 
the strong evidence in favor of a universe
of subcritical density. Rich clusters of galaxies are the largest
gravitationally bound systems in the universe. Although
rare, these systems are excellent laboratories for 
studying the composition of the matter filling the universe.
</p>

<p>
Using nuclear physics one can determine the baryon density
of the universe. With the density of baryonic matter known,
the total density can be determined from measuring the
baryon fraction. The baryonic mass of a cluster can be 
determined by adding the masses of the constituent
galaxies inferred from their light to the mass of the 
hot intracluster gas, which can be determined from X-ray
observations of emission from the gas. The total mass 
can be determined by a variety of methods. The
motions of the constituent galaxies allow one to 
determine the depth of the potential well and hence
the total mass of the cluster. X-ray observations allow
the same to be done with the gas, and gravitational
lensing of background objects by the gravitational field
of the cluster, resulting in the distortion in appearance
of background galaxies, provides a completely independent check
of the total mass. 
</p>

<p>
These techniques, and a number of independent techniques as
well, suggest a universe with approximately one third of the
critical density. Although a universe of critical density
cannot yet be ruled out definitively, 
the possibility of a critical universe 
now appears like quite a long shot. 
</p>

<h2>
Reconciling a Low Density Universe with Inflation
</h2>

<p>
If the universe is in fact of subcritical density, does this
require abandoning inflation? If a flat 
universe really is a "prediction" of inflation as 
once claimed, one would have to give up inflation.
</p>

<p>
There however exists an escape from this dilemma. 
Inflation within a single bubble can create
a smooth universe with a hyperbolic geometry,
just as is required for a universe 
of subcritical density.
</p>

<p>
Single bubble open inflation, based on ideas
of S. Coleman and F. de Luccia and of 
J.R. Gott, III, in the early 1980s, was 
further developed in the mid-1990s 
by M. Bucher, A.S. Goldhaber, and N. Turok
and later by M. Sasaki,
T. Tanaka, and K. Yamamoto. 
</p>

<p>
Inflation smooths the universe by postulating an
early epoch of extremely rapid expansion during
which whatever irregularities may have existed
prior to inflation are virtually erased. In ordinary
inflation, as developed by Guth, Linde, Albrecht,
and Steinhardt, this smoothing flattens the universe
as well, yielding a universe of critical density. 
In ordinary inflation, a critical universe could
in principle be avoided by shortening the amount
of inflation, but in that case the smoothness on large
scales remains a mystery, causing inflation to lose most
of its appeal.

<blockquote><b>The Creation of a Single Bubble Open Universe.</b>
The vertical direction indicates time and the horizontal directions
are spatial. The value of the inflaton field is constant on the 
various slices and the colors indicate the cooling down of the 
universe as one passes into the bubble interior. The bubble is
expanding into the surrounding inflating spacetime stuck in the false
vacuum. We live inside the bubble interior.
</blockquote>

<p>
In single bubble open inflation there are two epochs 
of inflation. In inflation the rate of expansion 
is controlled by a scalar field, known as the 
inflaton field. The inflaton field wants to roll
down the hill to the bottom and as the field
descends the rate of expansion of the universe
decreases, eventually ending the epoch of inflationary
expansion.  In open inflation the inflaton field
at first remains stuck in a local minimum of the 
potential. While the field is stuck there, a first
epoch of inflationary expansion takes place 
during which the universe is smoothed. In fact
during this epoch the symmetry of the spacetime
is so large that no particular time direction
is preferred over any other.
</p>

<p>
According to classical physics, once stuck in the 
local minimum the inflaton field never 
escapes. However, quantum mechanics allows
the field to tunnel through the barrier.
This tunneling occurs through the nucleation 
of a bubble that subsequently expands, 
somewhat as an expanding bubble in a pot of boiling water. 
</p>

<p>
Subsequently, the bubble expands at the speed of light.
It cannot have any velocity other than the speed of light, 
for else a preferred time direction would be required to exist. 
The surfaces on the bubble interior on which the scalar 
field is constant have a hyperbolic spatial geometry, 
and these are the surfaces that we inside the bubble 
later perceive as surfaces of constant cosmic time. 
As one passes inside the bubble, the interior continues 
to inflate, creating a universe with a large curvature 
radius. Further inside the bubble the energy of the 
inflaton field is converted into ordinary matter and 
radiation, and the hyperbolic universe continues to 
expand and cool down.

How Can We Test Open Inflation?

<blockquote><b>Microwave Anisotropy as a Function of Angle.</b>
Plotted is the level of anisotropy as a function of angle
and various measurements thereof. The curves indicate theoretical
predictions for various models. The solid curve indicates a
universe of critical density 
whereas the dot-dash-dot-dash curve indicates
a low density universe. Note how the position of the first 
peak shifts to the right to smaller angular scales in the low
density universe.
</blockquote>

<p>
The best hope for testing open inflation derives from
measuring the geometry of the universe, which can 
be determined through observing the ripples in the
cosmic microwave background radiation. 
</p>

<p>
The 3K cosmic microwave background radiation emanates
from an epoch approximately three hundred thousand 
years after the Big Bang, when the universe was 
approximately one thousandth its present size.
At this time the electrons, because of the cooling of
the universe, combined with protons and other nuclei
to form neutral hydrogen and other elements. Because
of this change in composition from a highly
ionized plasma to a neutral gas, the formerly opaque
universe becomes virtually transparent. 
The non-uniformities in the microwave background 
provide a snapshot of the ripples at that time,
which later developed into galaxies and the structure
that we observe today. 
</p>

<p>
Inflation in general, and open inflation on scales much
shorter than the curvature scale, imprints essentially
scale free fluctuations on the matter filling the 
universe. At recombination, however, the physics at
that time, believed to be well understood, introduces
a preferred scale of known length on which the first
acoustic oscillations of the plasma occur. This scale
is of known physical size, and from its angle
subtended in the sky today, we can determine the geometry
of the universe. 
</p>

<h2>
More General Open Inflation 
</h2>

<p>
The above models for open inflation provide a counter-example
to the standard lore on inflation, but they rely upon 
the presence of a local minimum in the potential
energy of the inflaton field. At our present level of understanding,
we simply cannot tell whether this is what is predicted by
a more fundamental theory such as M-theory or supergravity. 
But in the model theories for which we can calculate the inflaton
potential energy, such local minima do not usually appear.

<blockquote><b>Hawking-Turok Instanton.</b> 
A bubble universe emanates from a Hawking-Turok instanton. 
The vertical direction indicates time and the horizontal 
directions are spatial. E indicates the Euclidean region,
where time becomes spacelike, 
and I is the bubble interior. The heavy line to the left
indicates the mild singularity occurring in these solutions.
</blockquote>

<p>
Last year, Hawking and Turok realised that open inflation was in fact 
much more general, and could even occur in a theory where 
there is no local minimum in the inflaton potential energy.
In fact, they showed that for essentially any 
potential energy function allowing inflation,
an open universe similar to that obtained in the expanding
bubble described above could be formed. 
</p>

<p>
Hawking and Turok's calculation was performed in the framework of a 
proposal for the initial conditions made in 1983 by Hawking and
James Hartle. They proposed that the initial
condition for the universe should be that it possessed no initial
boundary. One can picture the spacetime of an expanding universe
as the surface of a cone, placed vertically with its sharp tip down.
Time runs up the cone: space runs around it. Time and
space end at the sharp tip.  The tip is `singular' in mathematical
terms and if this were a model of the
universe we would find all our equations break down there.
Instead, Hartle and Hawking proposed that the tip be rounded off.
</p>

<p>
This rounding off is only possible if the nature of spacetime changes
in the vicinity of the tip. In effect, all directions must become
`horizontal' near the tip, which is to say that all directions are
spacelike. This is just what we need to explain how time began.
In effect
the distinction between space and time is blurred and
space is then rounded off.
</p>

<p>
The region where time becomes spacelike is technically termed
the instanton region. Instantons are solutions to the equations
of general relativity and matter (here, the inflaton field) 
which have four spacelike directions. Hawking and Turok showed
that for essentially any theory which allows inflation, 
there is a family of instanton solutions each one of which
describes the formation of an inflating open universe. 
The Hawking-Turok instantons do actually possess a singularity,
but only at a single point. Unlike the singularity in the
standard hot big bang, which is so severe that we cannot
predict anything that happened in its presence, the 
singularity in the Hawking-Turok instantons is so mild
that, as for the singularity in the electric field
at the centre of a hydrogen atom, 
it does not affect our ability to make predictions. 
</p>

<p>
The beauty of the instanton solutions is that they not
only enable one to compute the probability of formation 
of open universes from first principles, but one 
can also compute the spectrum of quantum fluctuations 
present in the open universes, predicted by the no boundary 
proposal.
Turok and DAMTP students Steven Gratton and Thomas Hertog have
recently completed these calculations.
The calculations have revealed a potential
observational signature in the cosmic microwave
sky that will, if the universe has less than critical density, 
enable one to check which form of open inflation (i.e., 
with or without a local minimum of the potential)  was actually
involved.
