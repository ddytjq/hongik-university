  <p> <b>Cambridge, MA </b> <b>(10/05/01)-</b> The recent mysterious outbreak 

    of anthrax in Florida heightens concern about bioterrorism among an already 

    anxious public. New findings reported by Harvard biologists in two leading 

    scientific journals may help explain how anthrax does it damage and could 

    lead to new strategies to prevent infection.</p>

          The disease occurs when spores enter lungs, migrate to the lymph nodes, 

          change to the bacterial form, multiply, and produce toxins. These toxins 

          cause bleeding and destruction of structures in the middle of the chest 

          (medical term: hemorrhagic necrotizing mediastinitis). </font></p>

        <p><font size="2"><b>Treatment: </b><br>

  <p>The term anthrax refers to the disease caused by infection with the bacterium<i> 

    Bacillus anthracis</i>, a large, gram-positive, nonmotile, spore-forming bacterial 

    rod. Anthrax infection is exceedingly rare in the US, with only a handful 

    of cases reported in the past 100 years. These typically involve those who 

    work with livestock or who have been in touch with infected hides or wool 

    from outside the US. Anthrax can infect the human body by three routes- the 

    skin (contact with infected animals) , the gastrointestinal tract (eating 

    of contaminated meat) or through the lungs (inhalation of anthrax spores). 

    The recent cases in Florida involved inhalation, the rarest and most dangerous 

    route of transmission. </p>

  <p> One reason anthrax is so deadly is that it produces toxins that wreak havoc 

    on the human immune system. These toxins destroy macrophages, key defensive 

    cells in the human immune system. Harvard Medical School researcher William 

    F. Dietrich and colleagues identified a gene that appears to makes some strains 

    of mice resistant to anthrax infection.They determined that the mice that 

    were less susceptible to anthrax infection had a different version of a protein 

    produced by the gene <i>Kif1C</i> that transports molecules in macrophages. 

    By gaining an better understanding of how anthrax disables macrophages, the 

    researchers hope to open the way for discovering ways to protect people from 

    infection. </p>

  <p>&quot;While the effects of anthrax lethal toxin on cells are quite complicated, 

    the primary impact of the toxin is on the body's macrophages. The rest of 

    the physiological impact of the disease on humans and animals seems to be 

    secondary to those effects. The bacterium has evolved this mode of attack 

    since, as a key weapon in the body's innate immune system, macrophages would 

    gobble up the bacteria. Wiping out this first line of defense allows the bacteria 

    to proliferate unchecked. Our finding in mice represents a new insight into 

    a specific mechanism of toxin action in a well-defined model. Since this biology 

    is conserved across species, we believe that studying this mechanism in mice 

    will tell us a lot about the infection process in other species, including 

    humans,&quot;said Dr. Dietrich. </p>

  <p><b>Single Nucleotide Makes the Difference</b></p>

  <p>Working with molecular biologists at the Whitehead Institute, Dietrich employed 

    DNA sequencing tools to compare mouse and human genome databases to isolate 

    the genes. They then carefully compared the genes, looking for sequence differences 

    between susceptible and resistant strains. They found that single nucleotide 

    changes in the <i>Kif1C</i> gene appeared to be associated with greater or 

    less resistance to infection. An experiment in which they increased the level 

    of resistance to infection by inserting a resistant allele of <i>Kif1C</i> 

    into susceptible macrophages confirmed the original observation. </p>

  <p>The <i>Kif1C</i> gene codes for a transport protein related to kinesins. 

    Kinesins, sometimes called motor proteins, carry molecules along cellular 

    microtubules. The researchers believe that the polymorphisms in the <i>Kif1C</i> 

    gene alter the ability of the protein to do its part in protecting the macrophage 

    from the anthrax toxin.</p>

  <p>&quot;Research by other groups has indicated that anthrax toxin kills macrophages 

    by inducing a runaway reaction called an oxidative burst. We speculate that 

    this kinesin protein might be transporting either the elements that are part 

    of this oxidative burst, or the actual oxidative compounds themselves. Or, 

    the protein may be ensuring the prompt and appropriate delivery of compounds 

    that protect the macrophage against its own oxidative bursts. So, while the 

    subtle mutations that we see in <i>Kif1C</i> probably don't affect the macrophages 

    in their normal functioning, the decrease in efficiency during the stress 

    of intoxication by the anthrax toxin can mean the difference between death 

    and survival of the macrophage,&quot; said Dietrich.</p>

  <p>Further studies should clarify the effects of the polymorphisms and yield 

    even more insight into the effects of the toxin. While Dietrich does not see 

    immediate clinical benefits from the new findings, he does see the beginning 

    of an important research pathway.</p>

  <p>&quot;We intend to look for these variations in human populations; to figure 

    out what cargo this protein is carrying, and to learn why <i>Kif1C</i> is 

    activated under anthrax intoxication,&quot; he said. &quot;Once we understand 

    such phenomena, we might be able to work toward clinical applications in terms 

    of better diagnostics and treatments.&quot; </p>

    Toxin Inhibitor</b><br>

    <br>

    Another group at Harvard, led by John Collier in the department of microbiology 

    and molecular genetics, has devised another approach to blocking the effects 

    of the deadly toxins produced by the anthrax bacillus. By reviewing a large 

    'library' of peptides, Collier and colleagues found one peptide that interfered 

    modestly with with the molecular assembly process of the anthrax toxin. This 

    natural peptide formed the basis for the development of a synthetic compound 

    that boosted the inhibitory activity of the peptide by about 7,500-fold. </font></p>

  <p><font color="#000000" back="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" size="3" ptsize="10" family="SANSSERIF" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" lang="0">The 

    researchers then injected the compound into rats and exposed them to anthrax 

    spore. The toxin inhibitor protected rats who were exposed to ten times the 

    lethal dose of anthrax spores. </font></p>

  <p><font color="#000000" back="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" size="3" ptsize="10" family="SANSSERIF" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" lang="0">&quot;Clinical 

    anthrax is rare, but there is growing concern over the potential use of <i>B. 

    anthracis</i> in biological warfare and terrorism. Although a vaccine against 

    anthrax exists, various factors make mass vaccination impractical. The bacteria 

    can be eradicated from the host by treatment with antibiotics, but because 

    of the continuing action of the toxin, such therapy is of little value once 

    symptoms have become evident. Thus, a specific inhibitor of the toxin’s action 

    might prove a valuable adjunct to antibiotic therapy,&quot; Collier noted. 

    </font></p>

  <p>It will be some time before either of the Harvard research projects progress 

    to studies involving humans. Nevertheless, each of these projects suggests 

    new avenues of research in the diagnosis and treatment not only of anthrax 

    but of other infectious diseases and various cancers </p>

  <p><b>Anthrax Vaccines</b></p>

  <p>Louis Pasteur developed an animal vaccine for anthrax in In 1881. A human 

    vaccine, made by the Bioport company, is also available. That vaccine is a 

    cell-free filtrate vaccine, ie, it uses dead bacteria as opposed to live bacteria. 

    A human live attenuated vaccine is produced and used in countries of the former 

    Soviet Union. Such vaccines are considered unsuitable for use in humans by 

    US health authorities. University of Texas Health Science Center are developing 

    a new form of anthrax vaccine that could be taken in pill form based on a 

    modified version of the salmonella bacteria. That bacteria disables the toxic 

    element of salmonella, retaining its native ability to populate the human 

    intestines. It is not expected to be ready for public use for at least five 

    years. </p>

  <p>The Bioport vaccine is the only one now on the market for humans. Currently, 

    public health authorities recommend it only for those at risk of exposure 

    through work (e.g. those who deal with livestock or hides) and some members 

    of the military. One reason for this is probably that there is simply not 

    enough vaccine to go around. US Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy 

    G. Thompson recently announced that the government has no plans to acquire 

    the vaccine for civilians. The vaccine itself has generated a lot of controversy. 

    Some members of the military have refused to be vaccinated out of concern 

    that the vaccine is dangerous. While the FDA says the vaccine is safe, the 

    company that makes the vaccine has been in trouble with FDA over manufacturing 

    purity issues. </p>

  <p><b>Gas Masks? Antibiotics?</b></p>

  <p>Concern over bioterror attacks with anthrax or other agents has boosted sales 

    of gas masks and antibiotics among the public. The gas masks could protect 

    against anthrax if the public had sufficient warning, but this may be unlikely 

    considering that anthrax, like most biological agents, is invisible and odorless. 

    Anthrax can be treated in the earliest, asymptomatic stages with antibiotics 

    such as ciprofloxacin. However, detection of anthrax infection before symptoms 

    develop requires sophisticated laboratory tests. Once symptoms of infection 

    are present, antibiotics are considered to be of little use. </p>

  <p>Nonetheless, current government strategy in the event of an anthrax attack 

    would be to rely on massive stockpiles of antibiotics. Government authorities 

    report that current medical supplies on hand would be sufficient to treat 

    two million people for 60 days in the event of a massive anthrax attack. These 

    supplies are in caches distributed around the country. Efforts are now underway 

    to boost medical preparedness. </p>

  <p><b>Don't Panic</b></p>

  <p>While concern about a bioterror attack using aerosolized anthrax is at an 

    all time high, experts note that such an attack would be very difficult to 

    mount. A large amount of anthrax bacillus would first have to be prepared 

    and 'weaponized'. It would then need to be delivered into the atmosphere and 

    would be subject to the unpredictable patterns of wind and weather. Victims 

    would have to inhale a sufficient amount of spores to become ill. The notorious 

    Aum Shinriko cult attempted to release anthrax eight times in Tokyo without 

    infecting a single person. Anthrax is not contagious, so those not affected 

    would be able to assist those who were without fear of becoming infected. 

    The current policy in the US is to educate the public, avoid a panic and ramp 

    up coordinated public health emergency contingency plans. </p>
