          <p><font size="1"><i>Cybersports</i> v4.0 produced by CybersportsUSA
          of Redmond, Washington (not to
          be confused with <a href="cybersports_recruiter_review.asp">The
          Recruiting v1.5 Software by CyberSports Inc.</a> we previously
          reviewed) is a comprehensive statistical software package that is
          thorough, and quite robust.&nbsp; It is in reality more than
          just a statistical software package because it actually does a lot
          more things than just keep your stats. You can build tournament
          brackets, produce tournament stats leaders, provide live press box displays, and even allows
          you to web cast your games lives via CybersportsUSA's special live
          cast tool, assuming you have a live connection to the web at the site
          of your game.</font></p>
        <h3><font size="1" color="#FF9900">How It Works:</font></h3>
          <p><font size="1">Once you have installed <i>Cybersports v4.0</i> from
          the 3 1.44&quot; disks provided, you are asked for your Coach's name,
          school or organization, and product serial number.&nbsp; <i>Cybersports
          v4.0</i> license allows you to install this product on up to three
          different computers, but to install on more you will need to purchase
          another copy.&nbsp; The nifty thing about installing it on three is
          you can put in on your men's and women's team's computers, and one at
          court side for a fair price. <i>Cybersports v4.0</i> comes with a
          thorough and easy to follow users manual which we would encourage you
          to read through while learning this multifaceted program.&nbsp;
          Cybersports web site even allows you to set up a team page to assist
          you in having a reporting point for your stats should you not already
          have a web access point.</font></p>
          <p><font size="1">This comprehensive stats program works out of 7
          different modules which serve different functions including live game
          stats recording and reporting, cumulative season stats reports,
          tournament bracketing and stats reporting, a manual entry mode when
          you can't record live at a game or from video, a unique web casting
          tool which when connected to the internet allows you to post your game
          play by play and live stats on the web, a game monitor module which
          feeds live stats direct to a press box display, and a league standing
          module for tracking league results and stats.&nbsp; With each new
          version of this software more features are being added, and the fact
          that highly successful High School Coach Ernie Woods (Mercer Island
          HS, WA) is an integral part of the development insures that the
          program thinks like a coach wants to work.</font></p>
        <h3><font size="1" color="#FF9900">What It Can Do for You:</font></h3>
          <p><font size="1"><i>Cybersports v4.0</i> for basketball, will allow you to generate
          in depth reports showing statistical trends, comparative analysis
          between players, against specific opponents, and with specific five
          man line-ups.&nbsp; It has the ability through easy to use preference
          set-up boxes to allow you to set up team goals and through the course
          of the game and after to compare lives stats with team goals.</font></p>
          <p><font size="1"><img border="0" src="../../../../images/Reviews/PREFERENCES_AND_DEFAULTS_WEIGHTED_STATS.GIF" hspace="10" vspace="5" width="100" height="102" align="right">You
          can also set the preferences to record defensive assists (things like
          a steal, a pressured pass leading to a turnover, or hustle play to
          take a charge) and integrate that into your team and individual player
          performance stats.&nbsp; Their power rating function is essentially an
          internally imbedded set of weighted values which you can adjust
          through your performance preferences box which allow you to rate your
          players game performances and determine cumulative +/- performance
          effort over the course of a season, or against specific opponents.</font></p>
          <p><font size="1">The line-up analysis let's you compare the efforts
          of various groups of five players to determine which line-up may be
          the best for your team in given situations.&nbsp; This analysis is
          also a good way enhance your scouting reports for upcoming opponents.</font></p>
          <p><font size="1"><img border="0" src="../../../../images/Reviews/GAME_VIEW.GIF" align="left" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="200" height="136">The
          live game recording mode (see left, note all screens are in vibrant
          colors on computer monitor) allows you to keep all the normal
          basketball stats, box scores, and shot charts so you will not be left
          wanting there.&nbsp; In fact there are several very stat friendly
          features in Cybersports v4.0 we liked, including a court switch
          function that allows you to flip flop the screen quarter by quarter to
          keep the monitor matched with the direction a team is going on the
          court.&nbsp; There a a number of screen prompts which save you a step
          when entering live data as well including Assist? (following a made
          basket), and for most other stat functions likes a Which Player?
          (following a steal, turnover, or foul).&nbsp; You'll find the &quot;putback&quot;
          key a useful tool because on a tip-in it records not only the basket,
          but also a rebound for the player saving two click steps.&nbsp; All of
          the entry is in mouse mode, although there are function keys for many
          of the key features which in some cases when learned save you more
          time.&nbsp; There is even a new feature in v4.0 which includes the
          ability to assign a shot rating to each shot to determine if you or
          your opponents are taking easy, good, or poor shots and relative
          shooting percentages.</font></p>
          <p><font size="1">The developers do suggest that you allow at least a
          2-3 game learning curve before your statistician or assistant entering
          the data will become comfortable using this program and a spotter will
          be necessary early on.&nbsp; With experience one person may be able to
          handle it all.&nbsp; Just realize that the quality of your data input
          is directly related to the quality and skills of the person entering
          it.</font></p>
          <p><font size="1"><i>Cybersports v4.0 </i>will generate a multitude of
          reports including game, media and NCAA regulation box scores (by
          quarter, half and complete), play by play action, game leaders, team
          match-up reports, individual match-up reports, individual line-up
          analysis, team goal comparisons, individual and team shot charts,
          player evaluation reports, official evaluation reports and more.&nbsp;
          Copies of these reports and other software screenshots may be seen at
          the <a href="http://www.cybersportsusa.com">CybersportsUSA</a> web
          site. Remember as well that Cybersports allows you, through their
          online web site set-up to create a live web cast of your stats and
          play by play over the internet which has been used by several hundred
          teams in the last few seasons.&nbsp; It is a great way to keep your
          fans, parents, and boosters informed.&nbsp;</font></p>
