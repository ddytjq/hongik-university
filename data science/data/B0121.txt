      <p>Unless you are an existing account holder with the Newcastle Building 
        Society, we will require proof of identity and residency before you can 
        open an investment account. For further details please ask for our leaflet

        on my cheque investment?</font></b> 
      <p>If you make your initial investment by cheque this should be made payable 
        to the account holder or 'Newcastle Building Society'. You will start 
        to earn interest from the fourth working day (inclusive) after we receive 
        the cheque, until the day prior to withdrawal.

        </font> 
      <p>We are committed to ensuring that you are fully familiar with the terms 
        and conditions of your chosen account before you decide to invest. As 
        a result you will find that any terms and conditions associated with your 
        chosen account are printed in the associated product leaflet. Alternatively 
        you can access this information on our website. In the event that the 
        Society changes the terms and conditions of your account (other than a 
        change to interest rates) you will be notified in writing and will be 
        given a minimum of 30 days notice.

        associated with your account i.e. annually or monthly. In the event that 
        you have a query with your statement, or passbook entry, please contact

      <p> 
      <p>In the event that you change your personal details such as name, address 
        etc. you should notify the Society immediately in writing. Alternatively 
        you can complete a 'Change of Details Form' and return this to us together 
        with suitable proof of residency and identity.

      <p><b>F) <a name="af"></a><font color="#3e3e7b">Will I receive a passbook?</font></b> 
      <p>Unless your account is a postal account or online account a passbook 
        will be provided to you when you open an account. You are advised to produce 
        this whenever you wish to make additional investments or withdrawals. 
        You should also remember that your passbook belongs to us and you must 
        take care to keep your passbook safe and to prevent it from being lost, 
        stolen or used by anyone else. If you do lose your passbook this should 
        be reported to us immediately. Although we will endeavour to issue a new 
        passbook to you as quickly as possible this process could take up to fourteen 
        days.

      <p> 
      <p>If your account is a non passbook account you will be given a password 
        and/or unique User ID for security reasons. You will need to advise us 
        of this information in order to operate your account. Please note that 
        Newcastle Building Society can not be held liable for unauthorised use 
        of your User ID/Password information. 
      <p>In order to prevent the unauthorised use of your account you are advised 
        to take the following precautions:- 
      <p> 
      <p>* destroy any notification you receive once the information has been 
        memorised 
      <p> 
      <p>* if you need to make a note of this information please try to ensure 
        that this is written in a way that is only recognisable by yourself i.e. 
        in code and that the information is kept in a safe place 
      <p> 
      <p>* take care to ensure that nobody else can observe you when you are using 
        this information to gain access to your account 
      <p> 
      <p>* never store this information on your PC 
      <p> 
      <p>Failure to use the correct User ID and/or Password will mean that you 
        will be unable to make any withdrawals from the account. 
      <p> 
      <p>If you suspect that your User ID/Password has been discovered by someone 
        else or you have lost these details please call us immediately on 0191 
        244 2244 so that we can place a stop on your account. 
      <p> 
      <p>We will then provide you with a new User ID/Password. In certain circumstances 
        it also may be necessary for you to provide us with suitable proof of 
        residency and identity.

      <p> 
      <p>If for any reason you need to stop a cheque you must contact us as soon 
        as possible. We will then investigate the matter to see whether the cheque 
        has been presented and if it can be stopped. A cheque can only be stopped 
        if it has been lost or stolen and written confirmation will be required 
        and you will be asked to indemnify the Society.

        or stolen you must inform us immediately and we will then do what we reasonably 
        can to stop the cheque. (If the cheque has been presented for payment 
        and honoured, then we will be unable to stop the cheque).

      <p>In the event of a dispute between joint account holders or if they become 
        divorced or separated the Society must be notified immediately in writing

      <p><b>A) <a name="ia"></a><font color="#3e3e7b">What is an ISA?</font></b> 
      <p> An ISA is a type of savings account where the interest you earn is paid 
        without deduction of tax. This is not the case with an ordinary Newcastle 
        Building Society account (unless of course you are a non tax payer). 
      <p> The subscriptions to the account are limited within each tax year. 
      <p> ISA's were introduced from 6 April 1999 and will be around for at least 
        ten years. 
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p><b>B)<a name="ib"></a> <font color="#3e3e7b">What is the benefit of an 
        ISA?</font></b> 
      <p> The main benefit of the ISA is the fact that the interest earned is 
        tax free. 
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p><b>C) <a name="ic"></a><font color="#3e3e7b">Who can provide an ISA?</font></b> 
      <p> ISA's can only be provided by authorised 'ISA Managers'. The Newcastle 
        Building Society has obtained the relevant authorisation and offer a range 
        of Cash ISA's. As an ISA Manager the Newcastle would be responsible for 
        ensuring your ISA account complies with, and is operated in accordance 
        with the terms and conditions specified by the Inland Revenue. 
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p><b>D) <a name="id"></a><font color="#3e3e7b">Are ISA's flexible?</font></b> 
      <p> The ISA scheme was devised by the Government to allow individuals to 
        save using a variety of savings tools. The scheme allows for either short 
        term or long term saving. 
      <p> There are three main methods - called 'components' - in which you can 
        invest; namely Cash, Stocks and Shares, and Life Insurance ISA's. The 
        Newcastle Building Society offer the cash component. 
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Cash ISA's allow easy access to your money and are more likely to 
          be suitable for short term savings. 
      </ul>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Stocks and shares ISA's are more appropriate for those people who 
          do not need access to their funds and can afford to leave it untouched 
          for a period of say five years. You are not guaranteed to make a profit 
          as this type of investment can go down in value as well as up! 
      </ul>
      <ul type="disc">
        <p>&nbsp; 
        <li>Life Insurance ISA's are again for long term saving and offer built 
          in cover in case of your death. As with stocks and shares you are not 
          guaranteed to make a profit and you may even get back less than you 
          invested, particularly if you take your money out after only a few years. 
          <p>&nbsp; 
      </ul>
      E<b>) <a name="ie"></a><font color="#3e3e7b">Who can tell me about ISA's?</font></b> 
      <p> Individual ISA Managers will give you details of the ISA's they offer 
        and some may be able to provide advice. Any of the Newcastle's staff will 
        be able to explain our products. If you wish to invest in more than one 
        of the ISA components then an independent financial advisor can help in 
        choosing the right option for you. 
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p><b>F) <a name="if"></a><font color="#3e3e7b">Is there a limit to how 
        much I can save?</font></b> 
      <p> You can save as little as you like in a Newcastle Mini Cash ISA. The 
        initial investment amount may vary depending upon which of our range of 
        ISA's you prefer. During the tax year 2002/2003, the maximum amount you 
        can save in a mini cash ISA is &pound;3,000. This limit will remain in 
        force over the coming tax years. 
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p><b>G) <a name="ig"></a><font color="#3e3e7b">Can I have an ISA?</font></b> 
      <p> To open an ISA you have to be aged 18 or over and resident and ordinarily 
        resident in the United Kingdom for tax purposes (It is important that 
        you ask your Tax Office if you are in any doubt about your residential 
        status). With effect from 6 April 2001, ISA's will be available to any 
        U.K. Resident aged 16 or over. 
      <p> If you are a crown employee, such as a diplomat or a member of the armed 
        forces, who are working overseas and paid by the government then you are 
        eligible to open an ISA. 
      <p> You can not open an ISA if you are a non UK resident. 
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p><b>H) <a name="ih"></a><font color="#3e3e7b">Can I have a joint ISA with 
        my husband/wife etc?</font></b> 
      <p> You cannot hold an ISA jointly with, or on behalf of, anyone else. 
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p><b>I) <a name="ii"></a><font color="#3e3e7b">Types of ISA</font></b> 
      <p> There are two main types of ISA, called Maxi and Mini ISA's. The Newcastle 
        Building Society do not offer Maxi ISA's, but do have a range of Mini 
        Cash ISA's. 
      <p> Maxi ISA's can include Cash, Stocks and Shares and Life insurance in 
        a single ISA with one ISA Manager. 
      <p> Mini ISA's means you can have separate ISA's, from different managers, 
        for cash, stocks and shares and life insurance. 
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p><b>J) <a name="ij"></a><font color="#3e3e7b">What is the 'CAT' standard?</font></b> 
      <p> The Government has laid down a set of standards to help savers find 
        ISA's that offer reasonable <b>C</b>harges, easy <b>A</b>ccess and fair 
        <b>T</b>erms - which is why they are known as 'CAT' standards. 
      <p> 'CAT' standard ISA's will not necessarily be suitable for all savers. 
        If a product meets the CAT standards this does not mean that the performance 
        of the product is guaranteed. 
      <p> The CAT standards applicable to Cash ISA's are as follows 
      <p> Charges; There must be no 'one-off' or regular charges of any kind, 
        such as charges for withdrawals or any regular service. 
      <p> Access ; The minimum transaction must be no greater than &pound;10.00 
      <p> Customers must be able to withdraw their money within seven working 
        days or less. 
      <p> Terms; The interest rate must be no lower than two percentage points 
        below base rate. 
      <p> Rate increases must reflect base rate movements within a calendar month. 
      <p> There must be no other conditions (such as restrictions on frequency 
        of withdrawals). 
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p><b>K)<a name="ik"></a><font color="#3e3e7b"> What can I do with the proceeds 
        of my matured TESSA?</font></b> 
      <p>An investor has six months from the date of their TESSA maturity to reinvest 
        the subscriptions and maintain the tax free interest they have enjoyed 
        under the TESSA umbrella. The TESSA subscriptions can be added to a CASH 
        ISA without affecting the &pound;3,000.00 subscription limit. Alternatively 
        the funds can be placed in a TESSA Only ISA. 
      <p> Interest previously earned on the TESSA funds can not be reinvested 
        within an ISA or TESSA Only ISA. 
      <p> Prior to accepting TESSA funds into an ISA (or TESSA Only ISA) the customer 
        must produce a TESSA maturity certificate which confirms the capital amount 
        and the maturity date. This document must be retained as the Inland Revenue 
        may from time to time request sight of this document. 
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p><b>L) <a name="il"></a><font color="#3e3e7b">Can I transfer my ISA to/from 
        another institution?</font></b> 
      <p>The legislation allows for an individual to transfer from one ISA to 
        another, providing the ISA Managers allow transfers. Clarification should 
        always be sought before proceeding. 
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p> The Newcastle does not charge an administration fee if a customer wishes 
        to transfer their ISA to or from the Society. Under the legislation we 
        are obliged to complete the transfer within 30 days of receipt of the 
        original notification. 
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p><b>M)<a name="im"></a> <font color="#3e3e7b">Do I have to invest with 
        the same ISA Manager each year?</font></b> 
      <p> There is no requirement to use the same ISA Manager each year. 
      <p> Providing you only subscribe to one ISA component in each tax year you 
        are able to open an ISA each tax year with a different institution. For 
        example you could open a Mini Cash ISA with Northern Rock in tax year 
        2000/2001 and open a Mini cash ISA with Newcastle Building Society in 
        2001/2002. 
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p><b>N)<a name="in"></a> <font color="#3e3e7b">What happens if I pay into 
        too many ISA's?</font></b> 
      <p> The Inland Revenue will monitor ISA returns provided by all financial 
        institutions to ensure that the one ISA per tax year rule is strictly 
        enforced. 
      <p> ISA Application forms contain a declaration that you will not invest 
        into another ISA of the same component (ie Cash /Stocks and Shares / Life 
        Insurance) within a given tax year. If you do mistakenly invest within 
        two ISA's in any given tax year then the matter will have to be handled 
        via the Inland Revenue. As a general rule one of the ISA's will have to 
        be 'voided', and no benefit will be derived as a result of opening the 
        second ISA. 
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p><b>O) <a name="io"></a><font color="#3e3e7b">Will you accept a general 
        Power of Attorney on an ISA?</font></b> 
      <p> Applications made under a Power of Attorney, where there is no evidence 
        to suggest that the customer is physically incapacitated MUST not be accepted. 
      <p> This is a stipulation laid down within the ISA scheme rules and not 
        simply something imposed by the Society. 
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p><b>P) <a name="ip"></a><font color="#3e3e7b">What happens if I'm physically 
        unable to sign the forms?</font></b> 
      <p> An application by someone acting under a Power of Attorney may be accepted 
        where the investor is physically incapable of making the application. 
        Under these circumstances the Society would require; 
      <p> I) The Power of Attorney 
      <p> II) A written declaration from the attorney confirming that the investor 
        is physically incapable of making the application. (This should be attached 
        to the application form as the Inland Revenue may require sight of this

      <p> The Society can accept applications made by either; 
      <p> I) An attorney appointed for a person who is mentally incapacitated 
        (The Enduring Power of Attorney should have been registered by the Court 
        of Protection, or stamped by the Public Trust Office).

        the three day process outlined above. If, on receipt at the 'drawing'

        this cheque will not be honoured.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A cheque which is

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Society appreciates 
        that on occasions unpaid cheques could belong to a third party, and that

        the cheque would be returned unpaid.</font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This is one reason 
        why we do not charge for the first unpaid cheque returned on an account. 
        The customer must remember that the Society is charged by our bankers 
        for each returned cheque and whilst we are happy not to pass charges for 
        the first returned cheque we must ensure that additional charges are passed

        run their Newcastle accounts as business accounts must be aware that charges 
        will be incurred for returned cheques. The advantage to these customers

        circumstances the Society would have an indemnity from the bank confirming

      <p>It will ordinarily take three working days for a cheque to go through 
        the clearance system, however there are circumstances where the bank can 
        process a cheque up to three times before they return it unpaid. 
      <p> In this scenario it would be at least nine working days before the Society 
        was informed that the cheque has been unpaid. 
      <p> Due to the potential risk of allowing withdrawals against funds which 
        could be unpaid, the Society has decided not to allow access to funds 
        until the eleventh day following receipt.

        account, Is there any way I can do this and still have access within 10 
        days?</font></b> 
      <p>There are a few options open to you, which I will list below; 
      <p> I) The cheque would be banked as normal, and you could then contact 
        your bank following three working days and ask if they would confirm to 
        the Society in writing that the cheque had been paid. Upon receipt of 
        the written confirmation then payment would be allowed. 
      <p> II) A cheque can be banked under 'Special Presentation', subject to 
        payment of a &pound;12.50 fee. The Society then post the cheque directly 
        to our Bankers by first class mail. Upon receipt they then post this cheque 
        to the bank on which the cheque was drawn. This bank, upon receipt of 
        the cheque, will then notify our bankers on, potentially working day 4 
        and inform them whether the cheque will be paid or not. 
      <p> It must be stressed that as this service depends heavily on first class 
        post there may be occasions where we do not receive notification of the 
        cheque status within the time-scales outlined above. Clearly if the cheque 
        goes 'missing' within the system we can not allow a withdrawal against 
        these funds.
