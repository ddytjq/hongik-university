SECTION 1. Release Notes
1.1. Outstanding Issue

Batches - there is a known problem with authorisation of batches - if a user clicks on the drop down menu without any item in a batch being highlighted, then the software may crash. This is an unusual situation as, when a batch is opened, the first item is highlighted by default, and users are unlikely to deselect all items and then try to carry out an action from the drop-down menus. 

Foreign Currency accounts with more than 2 decimal places (e.g. Bahrain Dinars) - two of the available printed reports will only display the first two decimal places. Balances displayed on screen are correct. Two files to resolve this problem are included on the installation CD in the Technical Files & Drivers folder. The reports are  GRPINT (Group Summary Report) and ITFWD (Today's International Transactions) - to resolve any difficulties please copy these files to the Reports folder in your HOBS program, over-writing the existing files.

1.2 CHAPS Beneficiary account number field now mandatory 8 numeric characters. This was previously a free-format field. However, some banks / branches had experienced difficulties in applying payments to correct recipient accounts.
***Please check existing beneficiaries to ensure that all meet this requirement (8 numeric characters) and amend any that do not. If trying to create a payment to a beneficiary with an incorrect format, the account number field will be highlighted in red, and it will be necessary to amend the account number details before proceeding further.

1.3 BACS Payments to Inland Revenue

SECTION 2. List of Enhancements

2.1. A "Yes to All" facility has been introduced in a range of locations where multiple cancellations may be useful.
2.2. Requesting an International Draft, using GBP - country list updated. 
Countries added - Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, HongKong, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland.
2.3. Requesting an International Draft, using Euros – added drop-down list of countries on which drafts can be drawn - 
Austria Belgium, France, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain. 
2.4. Provision of export/import facility for CHOBS beneficiary database - a new facility has been introduced for System Administrators to export, very easily, a list of payment beneficiaries to a location outside the Business / Corporate HOBS software. This is much simpler and quicker than a full backup and allows the beneficiary list to be re-imported in the event of a software crash / database corruption.
2.5. If a user tries to delete a beneficiary that exists on a template a warning message is displayed to remind the user that the beneficiary should be removed from the template prior to complete deletion from database.
2.6. The manual configuration option for retries on scheduled download has been removed. The software will now automatically make 5 attempts to complete a scheduled task. 
2.7. Error when reporting number of authorised payments. Under certain circumstances the software included previously authorised but subsequently cancelled payments when calculating the figure to report as "authorised". This has been resolved and the correct number is now reported.
2.8. The system has been changed so that instructions can only be sent for Remote Authorisation when only one further authorisation is required to achieve "Fully Authorised" state.
2.9. The "Fully Authorised" message following Remote Authorisation now appears correctly. Previous messages could have been misleading. 
2.10. International Summary Balances Reports - Correct balances are now being retrieved and displayed/printed.
2.11. In transaction finder, the IDB reference (Inter Branch Debit)  corrected to IBD.
2.12. CHAPS- Beneficiary account number field now mandatory 8 numeric characters. This was previously a free-format field. However, some banks / branches had experienced difficulties in applying payments to correct recipient accounts.
***Please check existing beneficiaries to ensure that all meet this requirement (8 numeric characters) and amend any that do not. If trying to create a payment to a beneficiary with an incorrect format, the account number field will be highlighted in red, and it will be necessary to amend the account number details before proceeding further.
2.13. Data Export facility using BAI Format - there was an issue with some missing balances - problem resolved.
2.14. Windows 2000 (workstation) compatibility introduced - software drivers for SmartyDisk  V2 card readers integrated. Please note that although Serial Port Card Readers may work with Windows 2000, we are aware of occasional problems - If you are using a Serial Port reader and it appears to have an intermittent fault, please contact the Help Desk (0845 300 6444).
Instructions for installing the software on Windows2000 are included in the Documentation folder on the installation CD.
2.15. Help Files have been updated and additional context sensitive links added
2.16. Small number of users only- Problem creating user databases (related to number of accounts) resolved.
2.17. Small number of users only - Visa Card Download problem  - software patch that was issued now integrated to software.

******************************************************************
SECTION 3 Helpful Hints

? Help? is context sensitive. Pressing the F1 key gives immediate access to Help files for the section you are working with. Alternatively, the full help system can be launched by clicking "Help/Help Topics” on the toolbar and then choosing to display the first index entry. Help files have been updated and should be used in the first instance to assist with queries.

? Password Change Frequency – the System Administrator (under Site Configuration) can set the time limit for user password expiry. The default value is 50 days, but this can be amended (up or down) to meet your business’ security requirements for changing passwords.

? Extracting a file of cheques in serial no. order –using the Transaction Finder it’s possible to see all your cheques sorted into serial order number, aiding account reconciliation. To use this facility please go to the Account’s page, then choose File/Find and enter your selection criteria. Once you have found all the cheques for the date range you require, sort them into order by clicking on the “description” column heading (see also P.28 of User Guide).

? BACS Direct Template facility - some customers may not be obtaining the full benefits of this useful facility through a misunderstanding of how it operates. 

The facility is designed for use where there are a number of beneficiaries that are paid simultaneously on a repeating basis, e.g. weekly wages, monthly salaries. The following steps are for a weekly wages example but the methodology can easily be adapted to other similar situations. The simplest way to create a template for use each week is:-
Double-click on the BACS Direct icon; Select the account from which to make the payments and enter any reference; Select the date to process the payments – today, or up to 30 days in advance. 
To select the first beneficiary, click on “Add” button, click on “Find” button, select beneficiary by double-clicking and then specify the amount for this beneficiary. Repeat for each beneficiary required. Once all beneficiaries have been added, but BEFORE clicking on OK, click on “File, Save as Template” and give the template a name, e.g. “Weekly Wages”. Now click on OK and this payment file will be stored in Working Box as a BACS Direct file, ready for authorisation and onward transmission to the Bank. The file has also been saved under the Templates icon for re-use in subsequent weeks. When you wish to process the wages the following week, double-click on the BACS Direct icon, then select “File, Use Template” and choose “Weekly Wages”. Information saved from the previous time will be brought back to the desktop. At this point the file can be edited for any changes required in this week’s processing. Please note that any changes made, only take effect on the file submitted this week – the original template remains unchanged.
If it is necessary to amend the original template permanently, e.g. when an employee leaves, this can be done by clicking on the templates icon, selecting the relevant one and making the required changes.  

? NEW FEATURE - Beneficiary data export/import - this allows System Administrators to save all beneficiary data, external to HOBS, to insure against loss and removing the need to re-key beneficiary details in the event of database corruption. It is simpler and quicker than a full backup and we encourage customers to use this facility to preserve beneficiary data.

? Database size problems – please remember to regularly archive, delete and compact your database to ensure that required data is preserved, while keeping it to a minimum so efficiency is at a premium.  These functions can be found under System Administrator, Housekeeping, menu.

? Creating new Users – when the System Administrator is setting up a new User, if there is already a User with a similar profile to that required for the new User, the existing User can be copied. Click on User Administration, highlight the user profile to be copied, click on User, Copy, and enter the name of the new User; make any adjustment to the profile, e.g. different payment limits.

? Easier to remember PINs. If you have difficulty remembering an 8 character PIN, you could use a four character PIN, keyed twice – e.g. 20362036.

? Multiple selections – holding down the CTRL key allows multiple items to be selected by clicking on them so that the following action applies to all selected items, e.g. can be used when deleting multiple e-mails. 

? Description field on statements can be stretched to view full description – click and hold on right-hand bar of column heading and drag to required width.

5. V2.0 List of Enhancements - still listed as not yet in the manuals



1. General Usage

1.1 Remote Authorisation of BACS copy instructions

There is a known problem that can occur when copies of BACS instructions are sent. This is an intermittent problem and will only occur when the instructions are being remotely authorised. Therefore if remote authorisation is being used it is advised that BACS copies should not be made from processed instructions that exist in the Bank View box. This problem manifests itself by the instruction being rejected by the bank. To counter this problem it is advised that copies should not be made of BACS instructions that have previously been authorised. It is better to recreate the instructions.

1.2 Local, full authorisation of message previously sent for remote authorisation
 
A problem occurs when a message is 'Send For Authorisation', but is later fully authorised locally. When the message is sent for authorisation it is moved to the Outbox. If the message is manually moved back to the Working Box and fully authorised, it will be rejected by the bank. To work around this the message should be cancelled and re-created.  

1.3 Authorisation Message Box

For information a message box reports to the user how many instructions were asked to be authorised. Please note that the information displayed does not relate to how many were successfully authorised. If messages cannot be authorised then additional information is displayed on a per message basis.


2. Communications

2.1 Timing of Scheduled Connections

The operation of scheduled connections, and retries, can occur within in a few minutes of the expected time. Typically
the connection will be actioned approximately 45 seconds late. This is a known problem, and although the connections can be late they will occur.  


3. Reports

3.1 General Printing

Please note that it is necessary to save a new instruction before it can be printed out properly. If the instruction is
not saved then the print out will not contain data. Or if an instruction is being amended the amendments will not be shown. To save an instruction press the OK button. The instruction can then be viewed and printed.

4. List of Enhancements

4.1 Data refresh data locking problems - (updated data stored in local database but previous data still displayed). Intermittent problem - not affecting all customers. Previously required application to be closed down and restarted. "Locking" manifesting in following areas has been resolved. 
	i.   Business Visa Card Download
	ii.  Bank Calendar truncation errors during initial connection causing database collision.
	iii. Incoming email from Bank generating database collision message.
	iv.  Message collision during payment creation for all payment types.
	v.   (From iv.) Updating the Working box correctly when collisions have been encountered.
	vi.  Message collision during creation of all payment template types.


4.2 Beneficiary name now provided for BACS, CHAPS and DP payment types - had previously been missing under certain scenarios, for some customers - payments were rejecting.

4.3 A print option is now available for Business Visa card details

4.4 A fix has been provided preventing erroneous reports of ‘Bank Interface not running’ error messages, when the Bank Server is in fact starting correctly.

4.5 The error whereby local names were being changed in the HOBS database when changes were made to the Bank registration system has been resolved.

4.6 Null data values had been appearing in Direct Debit and Standing Order screens in some instances - this has been resolved.

4.7 Issues had been experienced as a result of customers not checking payment statuses before logging out of HOBS.  Information will now therefore be presented to the user reminding them to check statuses. Administrators should ignore this message, as they have no payment privileges.

4.8 When creating International payments, HOBS had been reporting errors relating to currency formatting, when the sticky pad option is set to on.  This has been resolved.

4.9 The final "Setup complete" installation message has been amended to advise users of existence of training software and asking users to use the Computer Based Training demo. 

4.10 Service now allows use of V2 of Smarty Disk for Win95/98/NT4. 

4.11 Text on account download status confirmation box has been amended for clarity.

4.12 Installation routine now includes options relating to Version 2 of Smarty Disk.

4.13 ‘Sort by state’ menu has been removed from templates screen - functionality removed previously.

4.14 Fix applied to prevent password histories being copied when creating new users using the user/copy functionality. Also prevents Smartcard numbers from being copied.

4.15 Users will be advised when a new account arrives through registration information from the Bank.

4.16 Amount field in BACS credit entry screen will now be highlighted, after beneficiary selection.
 
4.17 The Authorise and Cancel menu options have been split within the Working Box menu

4.18 The incorrect ‘expected credit date’ information on the print out of a BACS payment has been removed. This (incorrect) information is replaced with a text message allowing the users to calculate the expected credit date.

4.19 The size of drop down combo boxes for viewing account details in the payment creation screens has been standardised. 

5. V2.0 - List of Enhancements (Still relevant as not in manuals yet) 

5.1 You can now print the search results of the "Transaction Finder".

5.2 As the Housekeeping function can run for an hour or more on larger databases, users are now kept fully informed of its progress by means of an accurate progress bar.

5.3 When printing an International Draft, the account for settlement now correctly displays the name of the account to be debited.

5.4 You can now view standing order and Direct Debit mandate details from a menu option.

5.5 Exchange Rate information is now available. This can be viewed from the main HOBS screen by clicking on the icon.      

5.6 Credits in BACS Direct Payments and BACS Direct Templates can now be amended, edited or deleted more efficiently. 

In a BACS Direct payment/template, you can highlight the credits which you wish to change and then select the action you wish to perform e.g. Edit. HOBS will then display each highlighted credit in turn allowing quicker processing of entries such as amounts.

5.7 You can now request an on-line position update for multiple accounts simultaneously.
In the List of Accounts screen, 
	i. Highlight the accounts for which you wish to request an update. 
	ii. Select ACCOUNT -> ON-LINE ENQUIRY. 

The connection window will appear and HOBS will connect to the Bank. Once the update is complete, the connection window will display PERIODIC.

********** NB. IMPORTANT NOTICE **************

If a connection to the Bank is already active (with the status showing as PERIODIC) and you request a multiple account update, the connection status will remain at PERIODIC. Therefore, to establish when the update has completed, you should monitor the "Accounts Downloaded" figure which will increment as each account is updated. Please do not attempt to use HOBS while the update is in progress as this may prevent some accounts from updating correctly.

5.8 The Bank Box now displays rejected payments in RED.

5.9 The receipt of an e-mail from the Bank is now notified to the user. A message will appear in the Status Bar of the main HOBS window.

5.10 The Group Summary Report has been improved.

	* Report prints can now be requested for specific groups e.g. credit cards. Reports can also now be requested for 	  	  	  	  locally set up sterling groups. To do this, in the list of accounts, select the tab relating to the group of 	  accounts for which you wish a report. 

	  Select FILE -> PRINT SELECTED STERLING SUMMARY

	* The reports now print Accounts in alphabetical order. As this includes locally amended names where appropriate, 	  	  it is therefore possible to manipulate the order in which the accounts are reported.

	* The reports now include Cheque Clearing figures and Projected Cleared Balances.

5.11  When importing BACS Direct files with an unspecified date, the default will now be the earliest available date i.e. today's date when applicable.

5.12 For NT4 users with NT Administration rights, when backing up the database, the software now saves the backup path for future use. Otherwise, a dialog box is displayed advising that NT Administrator rights are required.

5.13 The "Transactions" screen print now includes Date, Description and Type.

5.14 International account Statements have been improved.

	* HOBS uses 'Value Date' Instead of 'Posting Date';

	* Transactions do NOT appear on the statement until the 'Entry Date';

	* There is an opening brought forward balance at the start of the statement;

	* The end of day balance is the sum of that entry day’s credits, debits and previous balance;

	* The total of all the credits during the statement period are shown at the bottom of the statement;

	* The total of all the debits during the statement period are shown at the bottom of the statement;

	* At the bottom of the statement, the balance carried forward is equal to the opening balance plus credits less 	  debits;

	* The layout of the paper statement is reproduced on screen;

	* Because of global trading, HOBS now flags up international entries received for UK non-banking days and 	  presents them on the first available one.
