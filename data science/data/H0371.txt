<h3>Section A - Initial Piltdown forgery discussions, 1953-55</h3><p>

I have re-edited this section to make it more chronological and
less confusing. A &quot;<b>~</b>&quot; sign means that the date is approximate.
A lot of the dates in this section are based on newspaper
announcements, and in many cases the &quot;real&quot; event
happened earlier. There was also a great deal of letter-writing
going on in scientific circles which is not documented here (but see
Spencer 1990b: 196-251). Most of the newspaper articles in this
section are from <i>The Times</i> of London and <i>The New York Times</i>.
A number of other missing articles from this period can be seen in
my <a href="http://www.net/~george/wishlist.html">wishlist</a>.<p>

<h3>1953</h3><p>

<b>July 30</b><br>
Weiner conceives of the forgery hypothesis while returning from
the Wenner-Gren &quot;Early Man in Africa&quot; conference.<p>

<b>~August 6</b> (and onwards)<br>
Weiner takes his theory to Clark, his professor, along with a chimpanzee
mandible he has experimentally altered. Clark contacts Oakley by phone
and later that day Oakley agrees they need to investigate, and that the
affair should be kept secret within the BMNH until they can do more
research and come forward with an exposure. Oakley begins a series of
new tests on the bones with other scientists.<p>

<b>August 17</b> (and onwards)<br>
By this time, Weiner has made two excursions to Sussex to investigate
the people originally involved with the discovery of Piltdown Man.
Woodward and Keith are never considered as suspects. Most of the
information that Weiner uncovers relates to Dawson and his suspicious
practices, so most of Weiner's research focuses in that direction.
His investigations continue for several months with the help of other
colleagues. Aside from Dawson, Weiner investigates Teilhard, and Sussex
locals such as Abbott. Although during his interviews Weiner tried to
avoid voicing his own suspicions, some could tell he was implicating Dawson
(Spencer 1990b: 220), while others could not (Spencer 1990b: 6.3.58).<p>

Weiner has stated &quot;quite unequivocally that before the public announcement
of the hoax in November 1953, I had ... carried out my main inquiries ...
without any prejudice whatever against Dawson. In fact until all the
scientific work had been done I had not concerned myself with a possible
perpetrator at all&quot; (Weiner 1973: 25). This statement is probably
inaccurate. Many of Weiner's interviews definitely focused around
Dawson; although not out of prejudice but most likely because they were the
&quot;hottest leads&quot;. The scientific work on Piltdown
continued well into 1954, and Weiner's suspicions about Dawson were quite
strong before then.<p>

<b>~September</b><br>
Weiner and Oakley meet in person for a preliminary anatomical re-examination
of the Piltdown bones.<p>

<b>November 21</b> (Saturday)<br>
Weiner, Oakley and Clark release their article, <i>The Solution of the
Piltdown Problem</i> (Weiner, Oakley &amp; Clark 1953), officially
announcing the forgery along with <i>The Times</i> (Anon 1953a) and BBC
broadcasts. Other newspapers quickly picked up on the story which
was soon heard across the world (Anon 1953b; Hillaby 1953). Oakley and
Weiner visited Sir Arthur Keith in person that same afternoon to discuss
Piltdown with him (Spencer 1990b: 207, 219). He was 87 years old and, along
with Teilhard, was one of the few remaining individuals still alive who had
been involved with Piltdown Man as it had first been discovered. Teilhard
only gave a brief statement to the press (Anon 1953n) and entered into
correspondence with Weiner and Oakley. Hinton wrote to <i>The Times</i>
shortly afterwards (Hinton 1953).<p>

The journal <i>Nature</i> was bitter at <i>The Times</i>, because the
editors of <i>Nature</i> had been in on the secret of the forgery before
it got announced and yet &quot;the scoop&quot; had not been granted to
them, nor had a general press conference been called (Anon 1954b; Spencer
1990b: 203). <i>Nature</i>'s article appeared a few days later (Anon
1953w).<p>

When the Piltdown forgery was first announced, it is important to keep
in mind that at that point the only publicly proven facts were that
Piltdown Man's jaw and canine had been forged. The skull, on the other
hand, was still considered to be a genuine fossil, of about 50,000 years
of age. However, over the course of the November 21st weekend it was
revealed that bones from the Piltdown II site were also forgeries, and
that the flint tools and the bone implement were also suspicious (Anon
1953d). These latter thoughts received more confirmation the following
month (see below).<p>

The newspapers immediately seized upon Dawson as the most likely culprit
behind the forgeries. Although Weiner, Oakley and Clark claimed they were
keeping their personal opinions about the forger out of their published
work at this point, their articles kept repeating that Dawson had been
staining bones, and that some of the bones could not have become stained
after they fell into Woodward's possession. The implication was obvious.<p>

The press had many responses to the forgery. Numerous authors pointed out
that other scientists such as Miller and Weidenreich had considered the
Piltdown bones to be spurious well before 1953. People were also
suspicious of Oakley's fluorine method, which although had now been made
more refined and exact, it had not detected the forgery when it had been first
applied to the bones in 1949. The public in general was unfamiliar with
scientific dating methods. Others, especially scientists, argued about how
incomplete human fossils could be more objectively interpreted in the
future. There were also arguments about how accessible the Piltdown
collection had been in the past for examination, and what the human
evolutionary tree currently looked like, and the role of scientists.
(See Anon 1953bcdefghkpwxy; Andrews 1953; Baker 1955; Berger 1953; Daniel 1953;
Ehrich &amp; Henderson 1954; Heizer &amp; Cook 1954; Hillaby 1953;
Hinton 1953; Hooton 1954; Lighthill 1953ab; Ovey 1953; Shapiro 1953;
Stearn 1954a; Vallois 1953; Washburn 1953, 1954.)<p>

The focus of research on human evolution had already switched to Africa some
years before 1953, and the debunking of Piltdown had no discernible effect on
that. The &quot;presapiens&quot; paradigm which Piltdown had once helped to
support was on a decline, although it still had its followers such as
Vallois. Zuckerman used Piltdown to argue for statistical analysis in
human palaeontology, which since 1947 had been his ongoing method of rejecting
<i>Australopithecus</i> (Zuckerman 1971 [orig. 1954]).<p>

Only a small number of people were negative towards the news of the forgery.
Among these were the zoologist W.C. Hill (Hill 1954: 148), and the American
physical anthropologist E.A.Hooton, who was skeptical but willing to concede
and move on (Hillaby 1953: 28; Hooton 1954; Spencer 1990b: 215). A few people
denied the forgery entirely. One of these was Hans Weinert, a German scientist
who had studied the bones in 1933 and who now thought that the mandible was
human. I have an article by Weinert (Weinert 1954; mentioned in Vallois
1954: 353), but since it is in German I am unable to read it - I hope to put
a copy of it online here at some point.<p>

The other dissenter was Alvin T. Marston, a 65-year-old dentist who had
discovered the remains of Swanscombe Man in 1935 and 1936 (which had now
become Britain's oldest human skull, Anon 1953v). Convinced from early on that
the Piltdown bones were those of two creatures, man and ape, and not a single
combination of the two, Marston (who had harassed the scientific community
before) embarked on a quest to prove that Dawson was not a forger and that
the Piltdown bones were still genuine. Marston got his opinions presented
in a large number of newspapers (Anon 1953cn, 1954a; Marston 1954ab; Spencer
1990b: 205 fn.1; <i>Picture Post</i> December 19, 1953: 41-3) and quickly
embittered Weiner, Oakley and Clark towards him, especially Oakley. F.J.M.
Postlethwaite also defended Dawson, who was his stepfather (Postlethwaite 1953.)<p>

There were a number of anti-evolutionists at this time who used Piltdown
Man's downfall to support their cause (Drummond 1955; Himmelfarb 1959;
<i>Time and Tide</i> December 12: 1646; Vere 1959; with reactions in Anon
1953y; Oakley 1955b; A. West 1959).<p>

On the literary front, Weiner had briefly considered whether the Rudyard
Kipling short story &quot;Dayspring Mishandled&quot; was a tangential reference
to Dawson (Spencer 1990b: 249-50). Some publishers considered using the wave of
interest in Piltdown to re-publish an earlier work of fiction called <i>When
It Was Dark</i>, but then abandoned the idea (Anon 1953iq). However, the plot
of a new novel called <i>Anglo-Saxon Attitudes</i> may have been inspired by
Piltdown (Wilson 1956).<p>

<b>November 25</b><br>
This was the first of three meetings concerning Piltdown which were
held at the Geological Society of London. Marston caused some sort
of disruption during the meeting, but the various reports of this have
only vague and sometimes contradictory details (compare Anon 1954i with
Weiner 1955c: 69). For reports of the meeting, see Anon 1953n;
Cole 1955: 158-60; Marston 1954a; Weiner &amp; Oakley 1954: 4-7;
Vallois 1954: 353-4; Wendt 1956: 416. In more recent literature,
the events of the meeting are discussed in Blinderman 1986a: 112-3;
Millar 1972: 218-9; Spencer 1990a: 135, 229 fn.20; Spencer 1990b: 205.<p>

<b>~November 26</b><br>
Six members of the British House of Commons try to table a motion using
Piltdown to affect the reputation of the trustees of the British Museum.
(Anon 1953lmors; Ovey 1953). On November 27th, a member of parliament
is interviewed about Piltdown on the BBC radio show &quot;Any Questions&quot;
(Anon 1954a). The Nature Conservancy is also nervous around this time
about receiving criticism for having formally recognized and preserved
the Piltdown site in 1952 (Spencer 1990b: 6.2.8,9,13).<p>

<b>December 2</b><br>
<i>Punch</i> publishes a cartoon of an ape-man sitting in a dentist's chair
as the dentist tells him, &quot;This may hurt, but I'm afraid I'll have to
remove the whole jaw&quot; (Illingworth 1953). Other jokes and political
cartoons around this time can be seen in Anon 1953j; Kramer 1953;
Spencer 1990a: 140.<p>

<b>December 3</b><br>
The Natural History Museum in South Kensington opens a Piltdown Man exhibit
(Anon 1953t).<p>

<b>~December 5 or 8</b><br>
Vere speaks in a BBC broadcast called &quot;Was Dawson Guilty?&quot; in which he
defends that Dawson was not the forger (Spencer 1990b: 226; Vere 1955: 11-2;
Vere 1959: 16).<p>

<b>December 12</b> (and onwards)<br>
Weiner's investigations into Piltdown Man's history during August had
uncovered an accusation that the Piltdown flint tools had been chemically
stained. Experiments proved this to be the case, and this was announced
in <i>Nature</i> (Anon 1953u; Oakley &amp; Weiner 1953; the article provoked
a new attack from Marston the following February). Suspicion next turned to
the other man-made Piltdown artifact, the elephant thighbone implement
(or &quot;cricket bat&quot;) which had been considered to be strange for
many years (Montagu 1954; Reeve 1953). Investigations proved that this too
had been faked. As the months went by, it was learned that many of the
Piltdown finds had been altered and that none of them could have originally
come from Piltdown - the whole site was a sham.<p>

<h3>1954</h3><p>

<b>February 24</b><br>
Marston confronts Oakley at a second meeting of the Geological Society
of London, arguing about the Piltdown flints (Anon 1954c).<p>

<b>March</b><br>
Weiner and Oakley make their first official statement on Piltdown for
an American journal, (Anon 1954d; Weiner &amp; Oakley 1954). There had
been earlier reports by other authors in American journals, see Washburn
1953 (with reactions in Ehrich &amp; Henderson 1954; Heizer &amp; Cook 1954;
Washburn 1954); Straus 1954a.<p>

<b>June 30</b><br>
Eleven months since Weiner first thought of the forgery, a third meeting
of the Geological Society of London declares that the entirety of the
Piltdown site was a hoax. Marston was permitted to make a presentation
at the beginning, but the speakers and exhibits that followed pretty much
closed the book on the forgery (Anon 1954efgh; Oakley 1954; Straus 1954b;
Vallois 1954: 354-6). The substance of this meeting later became Weiner
et al. 1955, published in January of 1955.<p>

Piltdown Man was a very significant event at this point because it proved
how modern scientific technology could be successfully used in archaeology,
especially for dating purposes. This was in agreement with the general
post-WWII trend of encouraging scientific research and development. Among
the techniques used on Piltdown Man were Oakley's improved fluorine analysis,
two different X-ray methods, tests for organic content, and the presence of
uranium and radioactivity. Although these methods had been in development
before 1953, Piltdown helped to draw attention to them. Radiocarbon dating
existed at this time but was not refined enough to use on the Piltdown bones;
this did not happen until several years later.<p>

<b>August</b><br>
Weiner has finished a rough copy of his book, <a href="#ac1"><i>The Piltdown
Forgery</i></a>. Teilhard visits England and discusses Piltdown with a number of
British scientists, including Oakley and Weiner.<p>

<a name="forgery"> </a>

<b>November 15</b><br>
J. Manwaring Baines, the curator of the Hastings Museum, accuses Dawson
of plagiarizing <i>The History of Hastings Castle</i>, as well as faking
other artifacts. One response to this came from Downes, who was
investigating Dawson's artifacts; and an anonymous suggestion appeared that
Arthur Conan Doyle was behind the Piltdown forgery (Anon 1954kl; Downes 1954;
Thorne 1954; Watson 1954; also see Salzman 1955; Weiner 1955b). Baines
published the book <i>Historic Hastings</i> the following year, but his
comments about Dawson have only reappeared in the 1986 edition (Baines 1986).
(For more information about Dawson and forgeries, consult
<a href="#D">Section D</a>.)<p>

<h3>1955</h3><p>

<b>January 7</b><br>
Sir Arthur Keith dies. Almost immediately a letter is published in
which Keith had said he thought Dawson was behind the forgery
(Anon 1955b; Hampton 1955).<p>

<b>January 9</b> (and onwards)<br>
A three-week series of articles begin in the <i>Sunday Times</i> (Emerson &amp;
Weiner 1955abc) to promote Weiner's upcoming book, in which he openly accuses
Dawson of being the most likely candidate behind the forgery. See Anon 1955a;
Baker 1955; Drummond 1955; Hampton 1955; Oakley 1955b; Salzman 1955; Weiner 1955b.<p>

<b>January 21</b><br>
The final conclusions of the scientific tests on the Piltdown assemblage
are released in an article entitled <i>Further Contributions to the Solution
of the Piltdown Problem</i>, under the name of 12 authors (Weiner et al. 1955).
These are essentially the conclusions that were announced on June 30 in 1954.
See Anon 1954m, 1955d; Burkitt 1955; Spaulding 1955; Vallois 1955: 297-8.
A summary of this article appeared later in an American journal in
October (Oakley &amp; Weiner 1955, 1957).<p>

<b>mid-February</b><br>
Weiner's book, <a href="#ac1"><i>The Piltdown Forgery</i></a> (Weiner 1955c), is released.
See Anon 1955ef; Burkitt 1955; Eiseley 1956; Hawkes 1955; Shapiro 1955,
Vallois 1955: 298-300. Responses were mainly positive, but Mabel Kenward
had some disagreements with Weiner (Spencer 1990b: 246-7).<p>

<b>April 10</b><br>
Pierre Teilhard de Chardin dies on Easter Sunday in New York.<p>

<b>late April</b><br>
Vere releases his book, <a href="#ac2"><i>The Piltdown Fantasy</i></a> (Anon 1955g; Vere 1955).<p>

<b>May 20</b><br>
Clark makes a definitive speech to the Royal Institute of Great
Britain about Piltdown Man (Anon 1955h; Clark 1955bc).
Oakley and Clark had given a number of lectures on Piltdown, see
Anon 1954j, 1955c; Spencer 1990b: 6.3.26. After this point, Clark's
speeches and publications only give brief, passing references to
Piltdown without much discussion. Oakley and Weiner would occasionally
talk about Piltdown as the years went by.<p>

<b>~May</b><br>
Sir Gavin de Beer proposes that the official entries for Piltdown
Man be removed from the indices of Latin zoological nomenclature
(de Beer 1955b). Marston had become quiet at this point but
remained very disgruntled (see Spencer 1990a: 229 fn.20).<p>

<b>May 30</b><br>
Weiner and Oakley appear on Glyn Daniel's show, <i>Buried Treasure</i>, on
BBC Television (Anon 1955i; Pound 1955).<p>

<b>Summer</b><br>
Robert <a href="#ac3">Essex</a> accuses Teilhard of being the forger (Essex 1977).<p>

<b>August 6</b><br>
It is announced that the right parietal bone of the Swanscombe skull
has been found, fitting in perfectly with the parts that Marston
had found twenty years earlier in 1935 and 1936. The importance of
the Swanscombe site was formally recognized in 1954 when the
Nature Conservancy made it a National Nature Reserve, as it had done
to the Piltdown site in 1952 (Anon 1953v, 1955jk; Wymer 1971).<p>

<b>November 1955</b><br>
Sonia Cole releases <i>Counterfeit</i>, a book about great cases of fakery,
including a section on Piltdown (Cole 1955; Crawford 1956). Piltdown
ceases to be a news item (until the 1970s) and for the next 15 years
is referred to mostly in textbooks, usually briefly (some good exceptions
are Howells 1967 [orig. 1959]; Wendt 1956: 405-17).<p>

<h3>Section B - Piltdown whodunit literature</h3><p>

Because post-1953 literature on Piltdown Man is most often concerned
with discussing who the forger could have been, a chronological table of
Piltdown forger accusations serves to organize the evolution of the
discussion. Some of the accusations listed below are fairly
&quot;small&quot; and unnoticed, but caught my attention.<p>

The dates on this table are not absolute. In many cases, the authors
had been building their theories for several years, and sometimes had
published it before the date indicated, but it went unnoticed. Although
many of the authors seem to be accusing the same victims, they often
suggest different motives and use different evidence to substantiate
their claims. Where there are several people accused at once, I have
tried to list them in decreasing order of alleged participation.
Aspects of this table are subjective as a result.<p>

There are also many vague accusations which have been made that are not
listed on this table. Glyn Daniel's personal list of people who he had
seen accused has some of the above names, as well as A.S. Kennard,
Horace de Vere Cole and his circle of expert hoaxers, and an unnamed
person on the staff of the BMNH (Daniel 1961; 1972: 263; 1974); a
comment which had been made both by Hallam L. Movius and Herbert J.
Fleure (see Daniel above, and Anon 1953e; Spencer 1990b: 211). For
similarly vague reports, see Anon 1978b; Cave 1973; Daniel 1986: 59; and

<b>Chronological bibliography:</b><p>

&quot;Announcement(s)&quot; refers to the article or book which
contained the Piltdown accusation which received the most attention.
&quot;Previews&quot; are any articles which foreshadowed or promoted the
announcement before it happened. In some cases, the Preview receives
responses from other authors. Lastly, &quot;Reactions&quot; contains
all articles which appeared in the wake of an announcement. This
includes re-reporting of the announcement, reviews, and debates.<p>

I make little attempt to discuss the details of the various whodunit
theories, but I have tried to identify the profession of the accusers
where possible. For brief descriptions of the people who have been
accused, see Spencer 1990a: xix-xxvi.<p>

Note that the chronological &quot;groups&quot; presented here are
partially subjective. I have not mentioned every single time that an
author has discussed someone's previous theory. Instead, I have grouped
articles together according to the theory they were primarily concerned
with.<p>

<b>Weiner (1955) accuses Charles Dawson</b><p>

Weiner's book was the culmination of his research to find the Piltdown
forger ever since he uncovered the forgery in 1953, and served as a
springboard for all future accusations. It remains a standard reference
work. Weiner has admitted that he wrote the book hastily (Blinderman
1986a: 105), to scoop Vere (see <a href="#ac2">below</a>).<p>

Previews:<br>
Dawson had been implicated by the media right from the very beginning
(Anon 1953a), but suspicion was not officially declared until January of
1955, immediately after the death of Sir Arthur Keith. See Anon 1955ab;
Emerson &amp; Weiner 1955abc. Reactions in Baker 1955; Drummond 1955;
Oakley 1955b; Salzman 1955; Weiner 1955b.<p>

Announcement:<br>
<i>The Piltdown Forgery</i> became available on February 17, 1955,
published by Oxford University Press (Weiner 1955c), and was republished
in 1980/81. Reprinted passages can be found in Weiner 1963, 1971.<p>

Reactions:<br>
Weiner's book created very little published discussion, aside from book
reviews. See Anon 1955ef; Burkitt 1955; Eiseley 1956;
J. Hawkes 1955; Shapiro 1955; Vallois 1955: 298-300.<p>

It is interesting to note that when Weiner was conducting research for
his book, he was assisted by a colleague, Geoffrey Ainsworth Harrison,
an Oxford professor in physical anthropology, who often went with Weiner
during his interviews (see Spencer 1990b: 215, 217, 238-40). Harrison
has occasionally reappeared in the Piltdown literature, but no author
has mentioned how his interest in Piltdown originated.
See Harrison 1983, 1990, 1992. Weiner began collecting evidence in Sussex
within two weeks of first realizing the Piltdown bones were
fraudulent. By August of 1954 he had a rough draft of the book finished
(Spencer 1990b: 219, 250), and he wrote the preface in October.<p>

The Piltdown story appeared again in 1955 in <i>Counterfeit</i>, a book
by Sonia Cole, who later went on to be a biographer of Louis Leakey.
See Cole 1955: 136-73; reviewed in Crawford 1956.<p>

Weiner, in his later years, had been thinking of re-writing his book, but died
before he could do so. Oakley and Daniel commented that Weiner was
going to take into consideration the new data that had appeared over the
years (Daniel 1982b; Oakley 1976: 13), but from his own words Weiner's
opinions had remained very much the same (Weiner 1974). Weiner's last
comments on the subject were recollections of how he had thought of the
forgery, the reactions when he approached Clark and Oakley with the idea,
and some of their early tests (Harrison 1983).<p>

<b>Vere (1955) accuses a labourer at the Piltdown site</b><p>

Francis Vere entered the Piltdown debate originally to defend Dawson's
name, but Vere was a pseudonym for his real name, which was Bannister
(see Spencer 1990a: 239 fn.36). Vere's first appearance was in a BBC
broadcast he made on December 5th or 8th, 1953, called &quot;Was Dawson
Guilty?&quot; (Spencer 1990b: 226; Vere 1955: 11-2). After that point,
a race ensued between Weiner and Vere to finish writing their books
before the other did. Vere seems to have finished his earlier, but
Weiner's managed to be the first to get published.<p>

Announcement:<br>
Vere 1955. Vere's book, <i>The Piltdown Fantasy</i>, was a
point-by-point refutation of Weiner's <i>The Piltdown Forgery</i>.
Vere's choice of the forger was one of the labourers who had worked at
Piltdown, and he may have been implying Venus Hargreaves.<p>

Reaction:<br>
Anon 1955g.<p>

<b>Essex (1955) accuses Teilhard</b><p>

Robert Essex, like Vere, wrote to defend Dawson. Essex was a biology
schoolmaster who had taught at Uckfield Grammar School during the time
when Piltdown Man was found. Essex had approached Oakley and Weiner
with his theory as early as January-February of 1954, but had been
dismissed (see Spencer 1990b: 231-2, 235, 241). He went on to publish
his suspicions anyway, but named Teilhard as &quot;Mr. X&quot;. Essex's
theories have since reappeared erratically in many Piltdown
whodunit articles.<p>

Announcement:<br>
Originally appeared as &quot;The Piltdown Plot: A Hoax That Grew&quot;,
published in the <i>Kent and Sussex Journal</i>, July-September 1955,
vol. 2.4: 94-5. Reprinted later, see Essex 1977. This
appeared not long after Teilhard's death on April 10 of 1955.<p>

<a name="ac4"><hr></a><p>

<b>Vere (1959) accuses Teilhard</b><p>

Vere made a second unexpected appearance in 1959 with the publication of
a small book, <i>Lessons of Piltdown</i>. This was essentially a book
promoting Creationism, as it was published by The Evolution Protest
Movement. Vere again defended Dawson, but changed his Piltdown
accusation, placing the blame this time on the scientists who had been
involved in Piltdown, especially Teilhard. The book also criticized
Teilhard's work in Java and Peking.<p>

Announcement:<br>

<b>Trevor (1967) accuses Woodward &amp; Dawson</b><p>

According to Spencer, a mostly unknown accusation had been made against
Arthur Smith Woodward and Dawson by Trevor in 1967. &quot;Jack&quot; C.
Trevor worked in the Duckworth Laboratory at the University of
Cambridge, and died in the same year he was considering his theory. His
work contained many suspicions regarding W.J. Lewis Abbott, the jeweler;
Wynfrid L.H. Duckworth, a Cambridge anatomist and physical
anthropologist; and Teilhard.<p>

Announcement:<br>
Unpublished, although he communicated his ideas to Oakley and was
evidently planning to publish his theory in <i>Nature</i>. See Spencer
1990a: 232 fn.78, 240 fn.41; Spencer 1990b: 6.2.20. Marston had also
been in contact with Trevor during 1967 (Drawhorn 1994a).<p>

Reactions:<br>
None; neither Oakley nor Weiner took Trevor's case seriously. But
coincidentally, around the same time, the British author Ernest Raymond
wrote a defense of Woodward, who had been his neighbour. Raymond
accused Dawson. See Raymond 1969: 139-44.<p>

<a name="ac6"><hr></a><p>

<b>W.R. Thompson (1968) accuses Teilhard</b><p>

Thompson, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, made an accusation
against Teilhard in 1968 in the context of discussing philosophy and
evolution. This followed a period when Teilhard's philosophies had
gained popularity during the late 1950s and 1960s. Thompson's theory
bears close resemblance to that in Booher 1986.<p>

Announcement:<br>
W.R. Thompson 1968: esp. p. 367-78.<p>

Reactions:<br>
None; but it was brought to attention later in Dodson 1981a.<p>

<a name="ac7"><hr></a><p>

<b>Leakey (1969) accuses Teilhard &amp; Dawson</b><p>

Louis Leakey, the famous palaeontologist, had had suspicions for many
years that Teilhard was behind the Piltdown forgery. Although
in his published works he never said so directly, he did not go to any
great length to hide his beliefs in other circles.<p>

Announcements:<br>
Leakey &amp; Goodall 1969: 90-100, 152-6, esp. 154-5; Leakey 1974:
22-3.<p>

Reactions:<br>
In 1970 it was leaked to the press that Leakey would be publishing his
theory in an upcoming book. Strangely, the articles identify him under
the name of James Leakey, see Anon 1970ab, 1971; Austin 1970. The
articles brought back a consideration of Essex's theories, see Head
1971. The subject came up briefly again in response to Millar (see
<a href="#thu">below</a>), in Thuillier 1972: 1002; followed by Russo
1974 and Schreider 1973.<p>

Leakey's suspicions were well-known enough that when he was invited to
speak at a U.S. symposium in honour of Teilhard in 1971, he was not sure
if his attendance would be appreciated; but he ended up going (contrary
to the claims made in Johansen &amp; Edey 1981: 80). Leakey later died
in 1972. He had been working on a book about his theory, but after his
death his wife Mary thought it best that it went unpublished. See Cole
1975: 374-7, 399; Daniel 1972: 263; Daniel 1975. Leakey's hypothesis
was later brought back by Gould.<p>

For other miscellaneous articles written about Piltdown around the
1956-71 period, see Anon 1969; Cockburn 1970; Cohen 1965; Daniel 1961;
Oakley &amp; Groves 1970; Oakley 1965: 12-4; Oakley 1971; and Weiner 1967.
There are other articles from this time period - it's just that I wasn't
able to easily categorize the ones in this section.<p>

After the 1953-55 heydey on Piltdown was finished, Oakley's fluorine
method for the relative dating of fossil bone established a firm place
for itself in most archaeological textbooks, especially those dealing
with chemistry (see Oakley 1963ab). Oakley went on in the 1960s to
promote the study of prehistoric stone tools in Africa (&quot;Man the
Toolmaker&quot;).<p>

Weiner occasionally wrote articles on human evolution during this time,
but for the most part returned to his studies on human physiobiology and
its relation to the environment, especially under conditions of high
heat. For some of his statements on human evolution in the light of
Piltdown's removal, see Weiner 1960: 741-6, 751; and (1962) &quot;The
Pattern of Evolutionary Development of the Genus Homo&quot;, in <i>Ideas
on Human Evolution: Selected Papers, 1949-1961</i>, ed. by William
Howells, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, pp. 522-5, 529-30.

<b>van Esbroeck (1972) accuses Butterfield and Hargreaves</b><p>

Guy van Esbroeck was a professor emeritus at the University of Gand
(Gent) in Belgium, and was also an anti-evolutionist (see Thuiller 1972:
1002). His book, <i>Pleine Lumi&egrave;re sur l'Imposture de
Piltdown</i> (roughly, 'Full Light on the Piltdown Deception'),
published in France, received little attention. His theory was that the
Piltdown forger had been William Ruskin Butterfield (given the incorrect
initials of C.S. in Weiner 1955c), the past curator of the Hastings
Museum, who had the assistance of Venus Hargreaves, a labourer from
Uckfield who had worked at the Piltdown site. The book relies heavily
on letters written by Teilhard, and spends a fair amount of time
attacking Teilhard's character.<p>

<b>Millar (1972) accuses Sir Grafton Elliot Smith</b><p>

Although the Piltdown debate had been relatively absent and unnoticed by
the public from 1956-71, Ronald Millar broke the ice on the silence in
1972 with the publication of <i>The Piltdown Men</i>. Millar identifies
himself as a layman (Millar 1972: 11), but I believe his true profession
may have been that of a playwright (see Anon 1972a; and &quot;Parents'
Day&quot;, <i>The Times</i>, July 13, 1972, p.11).<p>

Millar's accusation came just in time for the celebrations of the
centennial of Elliot Smith's birth (1871) in honour of the Australian
neuroanatomist. Elliot Smith's reputation was defended by a number of
eminent scientists. Oakley allowed Weiner to do most of the rebuttal
(see Spencer 1990a: 234 fn.41), and commented neutrally on the Piltdown
affair (Oakley 1973, 1976). Millar admitted to not having much concrete
evidence (Millar 1972: 233-7). <a name="ac10"> </a> W.M. Krogman, having
an interest in forensic anthropology, examined Millar's argument but
concluded that Weiner's accusation of Dawson was more convincing.<p>

With the renewed interest in Piltdown started by Millar, the
palaeontology division of the BMNH put out a small leaflet on Piltdown
in 1973 (later reprinted, see Anon 1975). Others took up the cause to
discover other forgeries that Dawson may have created (listed later in
<a href="#D">Section D</a>).<p>

<b>Bowden (1977) accuses Teilhard</b><p>

Malcolm Bowden's book, <i>Ape-Men - Fact or Fallacy?</i> used Piltdown
to attack both Teilhard and the scientific theory of evolution. Bowden
is an English civil engineer and creation scientist.
His theory was inspired by Essex's claims in defense of Dawson,
and he also briefly considered the case against Woodward.<p>

<b>Langham (1978) accuses Sir Grafton Elliot Smith</b><p>

Ian Langham, a lecturer in the history and philosophy of science at
Sydney University in Australia, was inspired by Millar's theory.
Langham considered whether Elliot Smith had been unethically involved
not only with Piltdown, but with the Australian Talgai skull, possibly
with the assistance of other members within the BMNH such as Woodward.
He was planning a book on the subject (Langham 1978: 183); however, a
few years later Langham abandoned his theory in favour of accusing Sir
Arthur Keith, but died tragically in 1984 before being able to publish
his research. Frank Spencer, who had also been considering Keith as a
suspect since the mid-1970s, took up Langham's work and published the
Langham-Spencer case against Keith in 1990, which had been foreshadowed
several years in advance (Bowler 1987; Spencer 1984: 21; Spencer 1988:
86, 115).<p>

<b>Douglas &amp; Halstead (1978) accuse Sollas, Hinton and others</b><p>

This accusation was the first major media-frenzy on Piltdown since the
1950s, partially due to its melodrama and the rapid spread of the news
through the Associated Press. Professor James Douglas, who had been
head of the Geology department at Oxford University, died at age 93; but
in a tape recording played after his death accused his predecessor,
William Sollas, of being the Piltdown forger. L.B. Halstead of the
University of Reading presented the tape and then supported Douglas'
theory, in which the Piltdown forgery had involved Sollas, Martin A.C.
Hinton, Dawson, and possibly others within the BMNH (Hinton, a zoologist
and palaeontologist, had died in 1961). The ensuing debate took place
mostly in two places, in the letter columns of <i>The Times</i> and
<i>Nature</i>, and included a side-discussion of the Sherborne Horse's
Head forgery, which for some implicated Woodward in the Piltdown
affair. (The Sherborne forgery was finally verified in 1995.)<p>

<b>Gould (1980) accuses Teilhard &amp; Dawson</b><p>

Stephen Jay Gould, a teacher at Harvard, well-known as a scientific
columnist and speaker, and for his studies in biology, evolution and the
history of science, brought back Leakey's suspicions against Teilhard
from the 1970s and thereby achieved even more media attention than
Douglas and Halstead. Gould voiced his claim in his monthly column in
<i>Natural History</i> in 1979, but it failed to attract attention until
he published a more thorough accusation the following year. Like Douglas
&amp; Halstead, the news spread rapidly throughout international
newspapers, in late July of 1980.<p>

Gould received responses from two main groups of dissenters. The first
group consisted of scientists and Piltdown historians, including the
first appearance of Peter Costello. The second group was what Gould
referred to as the devotees of the &quot;Teilhard cult&quot; (Gould
1983b: 201), whose comments appeared mostly in journals devoted to
discussing Teilhard. Gould's accusation occurred around the centennial
of Teilhard's birth (1881), for which a symposium was being held. The
speakers at the symposium included Richard Leakey and Weiner, who spoke
in Teilhard's defense.<p>

While Gould's theory was being debated between 1979-83, a number of
deaths occurred. Oakley died on November 2, 1981 (Daniel 1982a); Sonia
Cole in May of 1982 (Daniel 1982b); and Weiner on June 13, 1982.
(Daniel 1982b; Harrison 1983.) Commenting on Gould's article, Weiner
had continued to believe in only Dawson's guilt. Oakley, however, was open to the
Teilhard-Dawson theory (N. Hammond 1980; Oakley 1980b), which he had apparently
expressed in the past (Smoker 1997), but in the course of the Gould debate Oakley
changed his position and rejected the idea (Oakley 1981).<p>

Previews:<br>

Another series of reactions (Dodson 1981b; Gould 1981; von Koenigswald
1981; Washburn 1981) was heavily re-edited to become Gould 1983b:
227-40. For lingering comments by Gould about Teilhard, see Gould
1983b: 241-50. A few years later in 1985, the United Nations held a
Teilhard colloquium at which Mary Lukas had her last words to say
on the subject (Lukas 1985). Other speakers included Ellen Lukas,
Dodson, Thomas Berry, and Schmitz-Moormann. There is
a <a href="http://freeway.net/~dialogos/tdcun.htm">web page</a> by
Mark Midbon that refers to the colloquium.<p>

A number of the Teilhard authors often made reference to Peter Medawar
and George Gaylord Simpson, both scientists, and that they had spoken
in Teilhard's defense regarding Piltdown, even though they had criticized his
evolutionary philosophy. Unfortunately the authors failed to provide
references, but I believe I have tracked down the Medawar reference,
or something that could be re-interpreted as one (Medawar 1982: 210).<p>

<b>Matthews (1981) accuses Dawson &amp; Abbott, Hinton &amp;
Teilhard</b><p>

L. Harrison Matthews, a former scientific director of the Zoological
Society of London, wove a complex theory that the Piltdown forgery had
been started by Dawson along with W.J. Lewis Abbott, a jeweler and amateur
scientist. Matthews proposed that Hinton and Teilhard had discovered
their scheme and created further forged artifacts to thwart and expose
them, but the plan backfired. Matthews' theory, appearing gradually in
10 consecutive issues of <i>New Scientist</i>, was related in the form
of a story and relied heavily on artistic license, which weakened its
validity for many future authors. It received little attention at the
time, but was brought back later by Keith Stewart Thomson (Thomson
1991a, see Spencer <a href="#ac22">below</a>), President of the Academy
of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, who changed Abbott's role from a
co-conspirator to being a dupe. Solly Zuckerman, a primatologist and
once the chief scientific advisor to the British government, was also
inspired to accuse Hinton because of Matthews' theory (see Spencer

<b>Winslow &amp; Meyer (1983) accuse Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</b><p>

The accusation made against the author of the Sherlock Holmes stories
followed in the wake of Gould, but received less attention. The main
instigator was John Hathaway Winslow, an American scholar and
scientist whose exact qualifications were never clearly explained.
He had been researching Piltdown for seven years, and had taught
at the University of California and at Trinity College in Dublin. Retired
and living near Ellicott City (a suburb of Baltimore), Winslow was
described as: &quot;among other things...a professor, researcher, museum
preparator, and national park-ranger archaeologist&quot; (Winslow &amp;
Meyer 1983a: 43), and having &quot;a Ph.D. in geography from Cambridge
University, earlier graduate work in archaeology and anthropology, and an
abiding interest in the history of science&quot; (Schrier 1983).<p>

Winslow claimed to be working on a book about Piltdown, along with
Alfred Meyer, an editor of <i>Science 83</i> magazine, where the
accusation appeared. Confusingly, this magazine was started in 1979 by
the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and
changed its name each year (<i>Science 79, Science 80, Science 81</i>,
etc.), and ceased publication in 1986; but should not be confused with
the more well-established AAAS journal of the same name,
<i>Science</i>.<p>

Among the responses that the theory received were the most recent
comments about Piltdown from Gould and Langham. There were also reactions
from other scientists and authorities on Conan Doyle. A number of
comments were made to the effect that Winslow was looking for publicity
for his book; but Winslow remained mostly silent except for a brief
reply in <i>Science 83</i> and <i>The Baltimore Sun</i>.<p>

The question of Arthur Conan Doyle's guilt caused a flurry of reaction in
fan clubs and small press publications devoted to Doyle's work, a number
of which I have listed above and which may be difficult for others to track down.
For these I have to thank the curators of the Arthur Conan Doyle Reading Room
in the Metropolitan Toronto Reference Library. A bibliography for further
discussion on this accusation can be found in De Waal 1994.<p>

I have also found an article in Spanish (Fern&aacute;ndez 1987) which looks as if
it is accusing Doyle, but I am unable to read Spanish so I can't be sure. The article
mentions Winslow &amp; Meyer, but whether it is re-hashing their
argument or adding a new twist to it, I don't know.

<b>Costello &amp; Daniel (1985) accuse Woodhead &amp; Hewitt</b><p>

Peter Costello, a biographer and literary historian from Dublin, entered
the fray with an accusation of Samuel A. Woodhead, a chemistry
instructor and later a college principal. This was contested by
Woodhead's surviving son, Lionel, on the BBC television show
<i>Newsnight</i> on November 22, 1985. Glyn Daniel, the editor of
<i>Antiquity</i>, then received additional evidence that John Theodore
Hewitt, another chemistry professor, could also have been involved in
the forgery with Woodhead. Both Daniel and Costello had been long-term
observers of the Piltdown debate, especially Daniel. Costello was
working for many years on a book detailing his theories, but it has not
appeared. Daniel died in December of 1986.<p>

<b>Booher (1986) accuses Teilhard</b><p>

This accusation has gone unnoticed by other Piltdown authors, but it
bears close similarities to W.R. Thompson's 1968 accusations. Harold R.
Booher had been a psychologist on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in
Washington D.C., but had recently become a senior executive for the
Department of the Army. (See Booher 1986; as well as the front cover

<b>Blinderman (1986) accuses Abbott</b><p>

Charles S. Blinderman, a professor of English and Biology at Clark
University with an interest in the history of Darwinism and Thomas Henry
Huxley, published <i>The Piltdown Inquest</i> in 1986, the first book
exclusively on Piltdown to come out since 1972. For his victim he chose
Abbott, the jeweler, but admitted his case was circumstantial and could
be poked full of holes (Blinderman 1986a: 102, 214). Although he
received almost no newspaper coverage, he did get a number of book
reviews. Unfortunately a number of the reviewers (such as Spencer)
incorrectly identified Blinderman's choice of victim.
Blinderman's book was at the end of the slowing 1980s heyday on
Piltdown.<p>

Blinderman's book follows one of his other interests besides Piltdown:
anthropological controversies as they relate to the
Evolution-Creationism debates; see Blinderman 1985; 1986a: 235-42.
Blinderman abandons the whodunit debate completely at the end of his
book and uses Piltdown to try to prove the ultimate rationality of
science.<p>

<b>Grigson (1990) accuses Barlow &amp; Dawson</b><p>

Caroline Grigson, the curator of the Odontological Museum of the Royal
College of Surgeons, proposed that the Piltdown forgery had been made by
Frank O. Barlow, a staff member of the BMNH who had made the plaster
replicas of the Piltdown skull, and who had conspired with Dawson.
Unfortunately her theory was immediately eclipsed by the release of the
Langham-Spencer hypothesis which accused Sir Arthur Keith, also of the
Royal College of Surgeons (see <a href="#ac21">below</a>). Grigson
debated with Spencer, but did not mention her own theory. Note that
another member of Royal College, A.E.W. Miles, also took part in the

<b>Langham &amp; Spencer (1990) accuse Keith &amp; Dawson</b><p>

In 1990, Frank Spencer, a palaeontologist in Anthropology at Queens
College in New York finished his work on Langham's accusations of Sir
Arthur Keith and Dawson (see <a href="#ac12">Langham</a> and
<a href="#ac20">Grigson</a> above), and published two large books,
<i>Piltdown: A Scientific Forgery</i> (Spencer 1990a) and <i>The
Piltdown Papers 1908-1955</i> (Spencer 1990b). Most of the former book
is concerned with an excellent detailed history of the theoretical and
paradigmatic debates which surrounded Piltdown, only turning to discuss
the whodunit towards the end (Spencer 1990a: 141-208), but Spencer also
wanted to do justice to the role that Weiner had played in the uncovering of
the forgery. The latter book is an organized and annotated selection of
letters between the people involved in Piltdown, which Spencer provides
as a reference guide for future research. Both books are large and
thorough, but hide significant extra details in labyrinthine notes and
footnotes. Still, regardless of drawbacks, they rank as the best
reference material available, especially for any Piltdown literature
published before 1953. Spencer had been interested in Piltdown and
Keith for fifteen years: early aspects of his books can be seen in
Spencer 1984, 1988.<p>

1991ab (reprinted in Thomson 1993); Zuckerman 1990ab, 1991. Thomson's
theory was a slight modification of Matthews', while Zuckerman proposed
that Hinton alone had been behind the forgery. Matthews had died in
1986, and <a name="ac23"> </a>Zuckerman died later in 1993. Lastly,

<b>Tobias (1992) accuses Keith &amp; Dawson</b><p>

Phillip V. Tobias, a professor of anatomy, human biology and
palaeoanthropology at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg,
South Africa, added more fuel to the Langham-Spencer fire. His theory
was that if Keith had been behind the Piltdown forgery, it explained why
he had refused to accept the validity of Raymond Dart's find of the
<a name="ac25"> </a>australopithecine Taung child. The question
produced a flurry of debate (thankfully confined to the pages of
<i>Current Anthropology</i>), as well as two more accusations of Teilhard
being the forger by J.F. Thackeray, a palaeontologist at the Transvaal
Museum in South Africa, and Norman Clermont, an anthropologist at the
University of Montreal.<p>

Tobias' main purpose for talking about Piltdown is to remind the scientific
community that Dart (his predecessor) had been right all along about
<I>Australopithecus</I> and as such needs to be recognized for that fact.
More recently, Tobias has been re-using the same arguments to prove
to the scientific community that he himself has been right all along
about <I>Homo habilis</I> and as such also needs the recognition
(Tobias 1996).<p>

<b>Drawhorn (1994) accuses Woodward &amp; Dawson</b><p>

On March 31 of 1994, a case against Arthur Smith Woodward was presented
at the annual meeting of the American Association of Physical
Anthropologists in Denver, Colorado. The paper was by Gerrell M.
Drawhorn, a physical anthropologist from the University of California at
Davis (although as of 1996 he is now with California State University in
Sacramento).<p>

<b>Anderson &amp; Milner (1996) accuse Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</b><p>

Robert B. Anderson and Richard Milner, from the American Museum of

that was started by Winslow & Doyle in 1983.<p>

Announcement:<br>
The Spring 1996 issue of <i>Pacific Discovery</i> (Journal of the
California Academy of Sciences), pp. 15-20, 32-3. I have not read this

and Milner, his associate, renewed it again in March of 1997 in a debate
staged by the Linnean Society as part of National Science Week.
Anderson's father has portions of the original article on the web
which can be seen <a href="http://gwis2.circ.gwu.edu/~andersnr/robert.html">here</a>,

There is also a web page review located <a href="http://www.autopen.com/piltdown.shtml">here</a>.

The 1997 debate not only included Milner's case for Conan Doyle, but other
competing theories as well. Grigson presented her case for Barlow;
Currant (see next entry) argued for Hinton; and Herbert Thomas, from the
Laboratoire de Pal&eacute;onthropologie, argued for Keith. There might
also have been two other theories presented; and the BMNH was
intending to mount a new Piltdown exhibition.<p>

<a name="ac26"><hr></a><p>

<b>Gardiner &amp; Currant (1996) accuse Hinton</b><p>

In the mid-1970s, a trunk belonging to Hinton was discovered in one of
the towers of the BMNH and was brought to the attention of Andrew
Currant, a specialist there in fossil rodents, who then brought it to
the attention of Brian Gardiner in 1988. Why this took so long to
happen has not been explained. Gardiner, a professor in palaeontology
at King's College in London and President of the Linnean Society (of
which Currant is also a member), then conducted studies on the stained bones
found inside and determined they were stained in the same chemical
proportions as the Piltdown fossils. Gardiner went public with this
information (eight years after learning of the trunk) in his
presidential address to the Linnean Society on May 24. Although touted
as a &quot;smoking gun&quot;, there have been a number of skeptical
responses. Gardiner has not yet published any chemical data from his
experiments, and the <i>Nature</i> article has some inconsistencies with
the rest of the Piltdown literature. This development
failed to produce the media excitement reached previously by Spencer and
Gould.<p>

Previews:<br>
None, although a fascinating comment appears in Costello 1981b:
&quot;Even so [Matthews] misses some items: he makes no mention of the
stained bones found in Martin Hinton's office at South Kensington after
his retirement [in 1945 -ed.], along with all those old tobacco tins.
As nothing is thrown away at the museum, they are still preserved by
Theya Molleson.&quot;<br>
So it looks like someone might have known something about it well before 1988, which
makes it strange that no one acted upon it, since that was the most
intensive period of the whodunit debate.<p>

Announcements:<br>
The day before Gardiner's speech, the news was announced officially in
<i>Nature</i> (<a href="http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/piltdown.htm">Gee 1996</a>), and
in <i>The Times</i> (Hornsby &amp; Jones 1996).<p>

Garner-Howe 1997; Smoker 1997); Sharp 1996; P. Sieveking 1996. Gardiner also appeared
on <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/wesat/rundowns/1996/Jun.96/wesat.06.01.96.html">National
Public Radio</a> for five and a half minutes to talk about his theory.<p>

A 1997 telephone interview with Gardiner by Roy Goss Jr. (Goss 1997:
endnote no.9) revealed the following: the exact date and circumstances
behind the discovery of the trunk are not known. The trunk was
not catalogued when it came to the attention of the museum, and it
was stored for a period of ten or more years in an unsecured storage area.
Andrew Currant, who opened the trunk and removed its contents, did
not make a record of the trunk's contents, nor how they were situated.
The trunk has been discarded and does not exist today.<p>

<b>Walsh (1996) accuses Dawson</b><p>

John Evangelist Walsh, an American historian/biographer, renewed the case against
Dawson as the sole perpetrator with the publication of the book
<i>Unraveling Piltdown</i>. A significant portion of the book sheds
light on Dawson's career, and Walsh closely examines the many other
forgeries attributed to Dawson (see <a href="#D">Appendix D</a>). Most
illuminating is Walsh's use of a long-unavailable text by D.L.
Downes.<p>

In 1953, Downes was a graduate student at Birmingham University who
began researching Dawson's career upon hearing of the Piltdown hoax.
Downes passed on his research to Weiner to add to the book <i>The
Piltdown Forgery</i>, but Weiner only used a small portion of it.
Downes then began turning his research into a book of his own, but was
unable to attract any publishers. His materials eventually ended up
with the Sussex Archaeological Society where they became available for
study in 1993.<p>

<h3>Section C - Post-1953 scientific tests and questions of origin</h3><p>

The original scientific tests made on the Piltdown materials, their results,
and discussion can be seen in:<p>

de Vries &amp; Oakley 1959; Hall 1955; Harrisson 1960;
Hoskins &amp; Fryd 1955; Montagu 1960a; Oakley 1954, 1955c, 1960;

Vogel &amp; Waterbolk 1964: 368; Weiner &amp; Oakley 1954;
Weiner et al. 1955.<p>

An analysis of these tests for numerical has appeared in Ashmore 1995.
More recent tests and commentary are: Hall 1996; Harrison 1983; Lowenstein 1985: 545;
Lowenstein et al. 1982; Spencer &amp; Stringer 1989: 210. Oakley has
spoken of how he had applied the fluorine method in many of the above
articles as well as in Oakley 1963ab, 1980a. Another dentist (besides
Marston and Lyne) had once concluded that there was something amiss
with the Piltdown jaw and teeth, and republished his
findings (Taylor 1978 [orig. 1937]).<p>

Occasionally authors have offered ideas on where the source materials
for the Piltdown hoax could have originated from, in Clements 1997;
de Vries &amp; Oakley 1959; Drawhorn 1994a; N. Hammond 1997;
Harrisson 1960.<p>

<a name="D"><hr></a><p>

<h3>Section D - Other forgeries besides Piltdown</h3><p>

There has been considerable debate over fraudulent items or unethical
activities that Dawson and his associates may have been involved with
besides Piltdown, either independently or in collusion with one another.
This began when Weiner was researching the negative relations between
Dawson, the Sussex Archaeological Society, and the Castle Lodge
incident. Additionally, in 1954 it was announced that Dawson (amongst
other things) might have committed plagiarism when writing <i>The History
of Hastings Castle</i>.<p>

The plagiarism claim has been repeatedly challenged by later authors, and
the debate has continued to the present (see Lutes 1996; Walsh
1996: 84, 92-3, 186-7, 250). On this topic, one article that should be
consulted is by Peter Miles (1993), a bibliographer who examined some of
Dawson's long-lost source materials and annotation methods that he used in
preparation for the editing and publishing of <i>Hastings Castle</i>.
Miles concludes:<p>

<center><table border=0 width=80%><tr><td>
&quot;The annotations also testify to a certain energy if also a
limitation in the depth of Dawson's methods of working, and to some
problems caused, arguably, by over-ambition and by loose scholarly
method. While they suggest no fraud on the scale of Piltdown, they do
perhaps suggest a man not afraid of taking a short-cut or two.
Admittedly, as far as his role at Piltdown was to be concerned, such a
characteristic qualified Dawson as much for the role of hoaxed as for
the role of hoaxer.&quot; (P. Miles 1993: 370)<p>
</td></tr></table></center>

Dawson, however, may have created a number of suspicious artifacts;
one of the more complete listings of them can
be found in M. Jones 1990: 93-6. But for full detail on Dawson's artifacts
and career, consult Walsh 1996, especially pp. 169-98, 246-53. Also,
consult <a href="#forgery">Section A</a> and <a href="#ac29">Walsh</a>,
above.<p>

Aside from Charles Dawson, other people involved in unethical
activities who have been suggested are W.J. Lewis Abbott, George
Bristow, William Ruskin Butterfield, John Lewis, Edward Simpson (a.k.a.
&quot;Flint Jack&quot;), and Henry Willett.<p>

The original claims made by Baines and Weiner, and further comments and
reactions can be seen in Anon 1954kl; Baines 1986; Cole 1955: 162; Emerson &amp;
Weiner 1955ab; Rieth 1967: 48, 77-80; Salzman 1955; Weiner 1955b;
Weiner 1955c: 169-88. For various defenses against these claims, see
Blinderman 1986a: 110-1; Downes 1954; Kermack 1974; P. Miles 1993;
Spencer 1990a: 231 fn.70; Thorne 1954; and Vere 1955: 99-110.<p>

There is also the case of the Sherborne bone, a British fossil bone with an engraving of a horse
on it, which several people had considered to be a forgery. Since one of the
original people who inspected and interpreted it was Woodward, some authors have tried
to make a link between Sherborne and Piltdown. For articles on this
debate, consult <a href="#ac13">Section B: Douglas &amp; Halstead</a>.
Recent tests in 1995 have verified that the bone is genuine, but the
carving is indeed a forgery.<p>

In August of 1962 it was revealed that a significant portion of exotic
and rare birds which had been &quot;collected&quot; in the Hastings area
between 1903 and 1916 were forgeries, in the sense that they had been
secretly imported from all over the world in refrigerated conditions and
then claimed to have been locally shot. Various people implicated in
the affair may also have been involved with Piltdown. See <i>The
Times</i> for August 10, 1962 (p.8), August 11 (p.4) and August 15 (p.11); <i>British
Birds</i> 55.8 (August 1962): 281-384, and 55.10 (October 1962): 425-7,
453-9; mentioned in Blinderman 1986a: 119; A.P. Chamberlain 1968; Rieth
1967: 31-3, 48; and van Esbroeck 1972: 48-50.<p>

With the development of the Thermoluminescence dating technique in the
early 1970s, Glyn Daniel took an interest in the method and allowed
<i>Antiquity</i> to publish articles on forged Roman brick-stamps which
Dawson had &quot;found&quot;. See Peacock 1973.
Around the same time, a claim was made that Dawson had also made a
fraudulent map (Andrews 1974). This led to a heated debate in the
letter columns of <i>The Times</i> on Piltdown and Dawson. See Howard
1974; with reactions in Ball 1974; Daniel 1974; Kermack 1974;
Scheuer 1974ab; Steer 1974; Weiner 1974. It is interesting to note that
this sudden resurgence of interest in Dawson took place shortly after
the silence on Piltdown had been broken by Millar's book (Millar
1972).<p>

Since then, the most recent wave of Dawson-forgery claims has been in
1977-81; see Combridge 1977. After an article by Heal (1980); and
other independent articles (Holden 1980, 1981; McCann 1981); a response came
from Combridge (1981). John Clements, a member of the Hastings Museum
Association, has recently proposed a theory about where Dawson could have
acquired his materials from if he was the culprit (Clements 1997; N. Hammond 1997).<p>

Piltdown occurs in books and articles about fraud and forgery, of two
general types. This is not an exhaustive list, but gives a wide variety

<h3>Section F - General science literature</h3><p>

Please note that the books in this section are <b>NOT</b> a definitive
list, as a mentioning of Piltdown can be found in almost any book on
human evolution, the history of palaeoanthropology, or physical
anthropology. The lists below are semi-subjective groupings of books
and articles which offer a wide variety of examples of the emphasis and
meaning that authors have chosen to ascribe to Piltdown.<p>

During the 1956-71 period, the only real place that Piltdown ever got
mentioned was in books. Many authors, including Le Gros Clark,
preferred to give Piltdown only a brief passing reference, usually
ignoring the role it had played in shaping theories for decades.<p>

Other books gave a more thorough description of Piltdown. Most authors
completely avoided the question of the whodunit, while the few who did
bring it up mentioned the possibility of Dawson's guilt but left room
for doubt. For examples, see:<br>
<ul><li>Brace &amp; Montagu 1965: 154, 165-71; Howells 1967 (1st ed.
1959): 249-63; Leakey &amp; Goodall 1969: 90-100, 152-6; Montagu 1960b:
220-30; Moore 1967: 357-77; Wendt 1956: 405-17 (which inadvertently
caused a strange discussion in Boswell 1963; Durrenberger 1965).</ul><p>

After 1972, when the subject of Piltdown was being discussed more
frequently, some books still gave it surprisingly little attention, and like
their predecessors delegated the subject to a short paragraph or a footnote.
But with the growing number of finds of fossil man in Africa, there was
now a better awareness of the role that Piltdown had played in shaping the scientific
evolutionary paradigms from 1912-1953, especially as it had related to
Africa. Piltdown has also figured in various histories and biographies.
See:<br>
<ul><li>Bowler 1986: 35-8, 91-100, 239-44; Johanson &amp; Edey 1981:
48-53, 77-83, 95-6; Lewin 1987: 60-75, 132-7; Reader 1981: 55-82, 130-2;
Spencer 1997; Stearn 1981: 188-9, 235-6, 244-7; Wendt 1972: 149-55.</ul><p>

Aside from books, the importance of Piltdown in the context of
historical paradigms can be examined in a number of articles, the ones
most recommended being by Michael Hammond and Frank Spencer. See:<br>
<ul><li>Boaz 1981: 397-400; M. Hammond 1979, 1988; M.
Hammond 1982: 1-2, 23-7; Spencer 1984: 21-3, 33-4; Spencer 1988: 84-6,
102-10; Tobias 1985: 34-8; Weiner 1982.</ul><p>

The 1994 fossil tibia discovery of &quot;Boxgrove Man&quot; caused a
resurgence of British nationalistic pride (at least, in the editorial
staff of <i>The Times</i>; they broke the story without permission
one week before the official press conference), pride which was
frighteningly similar to the announcements
of the discovery of Piltdown 80 years earlier. This time around,
however, the attitude has been thoroughly criticized by the public.
See:<br>
<ul><li>Anon 1994, 1996; Dennell 1994; N. Hammond 1994; S. Jones 1996;
Musty 1994; R. West 1996; as well as <I>The Times</I> for May 19 1994
(p.17) and May 23 1994 (p.15)</ul><p>

Many authors have commented on how hyper-nationalism in Europe
around the turn of the century had caused British scientists to look for
a major discovery of fossil man on their own soil. Piltdown Man fulfilled
that desire perfectly. Roy Goss Jr. (royg@pixi.com), an anthropology major at the
University of Hawaii at West Oahu, has taken this one step further. Not only did the
British scientific community want a discovery, but the British people
as a whole were looking for a new source of nationalistic pride for themselves.<p>

In 1895 Britain's empire had been at its height, but upon entering a conflict with the
United States (a frontier dispute between British Guiana and Venezuela), Britain
began a long and gradual period of political decline. The disagreement with the
U.S. was quickly interrupted by the Boer War in South Africa, in which British
soldiers suffered high casualties. In 1901, Queen Victoria had died; and in 1912
the British explorer R.F. Scott lost the race to be the first to reach the South
Pole - dying in the attempt along with his entire expedition. Coupling these
facts with the lack of British human fossils and the atmosphere of nationalism
that blanketed Europe, shows that Piltdown Man came just in time to cheer up the
British populace (Goss 1997: section IV).<p>

<a name="G"><hr></a><p>

<h3>Section G - Anti-evolutionist / Pseudo-scientific literature (for and against)</h3><p>

Again, this is not a comprehensive list, but just some examples. Almost
any book by Creation Scientists discussing human evolution has a
discussion of Piltdown Man or Nebraska Man. For some examples which use
Piltdown, see Bowden 1977: 3-43; Gish 1974: 91-2; Himmelfarb 1959: 355-7
(but see A. West 1959); Lubenow 1992; G.E. Parker 1987: 153-60; Sanderson 1961: 62-3,
354, 363-5; van Esbroeck 1972: 55-69; Vere 1959. Nickell &amp; Fischer
(1992) included a section on Piltdown in their book which discussed
paranormal, historical and forensic mysteries.<p>

There are also Piltdown-using retaliations to anti-evolutionist and
pseudo-scientist claims, as well as articles that deal with Piltdown as
an example of the scientific process. See Blinderman 1986a: 235-42; Feder 1990a:
40-56; Feder 1990b; Langdon 1992b; Ostrom 1994 (an article questioning the
reliability of the HIV antibody test); Williams 1993.<p>

<h3>Section H - Media and entertainment</h3><p>

These are rather difficult to track down and find references for, so I'm pretty sure this list is not a great
reference guide. In most cases I have very few details and have not been able to verify content.<p>

<b>Television</b><p>
I'll start this with the documentaries, and then work down towards the smaller
material.<p>
<ul>
<li>Weiner and Oakley appeared on Glyn Daniel's BBC Television series, <i>Buried
Treasure</i>, on May 30 of 1955 to talk about Piltdown (Anon 1955i; Pound 1955: 1044).
<li>Blinderman has cited that the BBC had made two television documentaries about
Piltdown (Blinderman 1986a: 4), but he did not say what they were. One of them
might have been for the BBC Television show, <i>Chronicle</i>, some time around 1973
(see Oakley 1976).
<li>Blinderman's 1986 accusation may have inspired a BBC television episode of <i>Q.E.D.</i>, aired on
April Fool's Day in 1987. Entitled, &quot;Murder on the Bluebell Line&quot;, it examined the Piltdown
whodunit in Sherlock Holmesian style (see Anon 1987abc; Jenkins 1987). It was written by John Lynch.
<li><i>Do Scientists Cheat?</i> (1988), a videotape in the Audiovisual Archive of
the Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center, at the University of Wisconsin
(Madison). A production of the Documentary Guild in association with WGBH/Boston for NOVA, WGBH
Educational Foundation. An investigation into the ethical requirements of scientists involved in research. It
describes earlier fraudulent scientific work, including Piltdown Man.
<li>On October 15 of 1992 there was a &quot;science-fiction&quot; program shown on Yorkshire
Television called <i>Sherlock Holmes and The Case of the Missing Link</i>. The subject was about Arthur
Conan Doyle and Piltdown, but it apparently contained a number of inaccuracies (Crombie 1992).
<li>I have been told that the science documentary series <i>Missing Links</i> (1996?) may have had an
episode entitled &quot;Skull Wars: Search For The Missing Link&quot; which was primarily about the
discovery and eventual scientific acceptance of the Taung Child skull. I was told that Piltdown Man figured
prominantly in the documentary, including some old television footage; and that Tobias was interviewed at
length (see the <a href="#ac24">Tobias</a> section on why he talks about Piltdown). I think that The
Discovery Channel (U.S.) holds the broadcast rights.
<li>Jack Palance talked about Piltdown for a few minutes on <i>Ripley's Believe it or Not</i>.
<li>In the comedy series <i>Fawlty Towers</i>, in &quot;The Psychiatrist&quot; episode,
Basil Fawlty (John Cleese) takes a disliking to a young male hotel guest who
wanders around with his shirt unbuttoned. One of the remarks that Basil makes
under his breath is to refer to him as &quot;the Piltdown ponce&quot;.
<li>When Peter Costello accused Samuel A. Woodhead of being the Piltdown forger, he was contested by
Woodhead's surviving son Lionel on the BBC Television
show <i>Newsnight</i> on November 22, 1985.
<li>L.B. Halstead talked about his accusation of Sollas in a BBC External Service broadcast on Novermber
14, 1978. Actually, I don't know if this was on television
or on radio. Which brings us to...
</ul><p>

<b>Radio</b><p>

<ul><li>The BBC broke the news of the Piltdown forgery on Saturday, November 21, 1953.
<li>On November 27 of 1953, a member of the British parliament gave his opinions about Piltdown on the
BBC show <i>Any Questions</i> (Anon 1954a).
<li>Vere spoke in a BBC broadcast on December 5th or 8th, 1953, called, <i>Was Dawson Guilty?</i> in
which he defended that Dawson was not
the Piltdown forger (Spencer 1990b: 226; Vere 1955: 11-2; Vere 1959: 16).
<li>Brian Gardiner was on National Public Radio for five and a half minutes to be interviewed about his
accusation of Hinton. See the first hour of
<a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/wesat/rundowns/1996/Jun.96/wesat.06.01.96.html"><i>Weekend
Edition Saturday</i></a> for June 1, 1996, hosted by Scott Simon.
</ul><p>

<b>Fiction</b><p>

This section is in chronological order.<p>
<ul>
<li>Arthur Conan Doyle's story, <i>The Lost World</i>, may have been partially inspired by Piltdown
Man's discovery.
<li>Weiner considered at one point whether the Rudyard Kipling short story <i>Dayspring Mishandled</i>
was a tangential reference to Dawson (Spencer 1990b: 249-50).
<li>When the Piltdown forgery was announced in 1953, some publishers considered using the hype to re-
publish an earlier work of fiction called <i>When It Was Dark</i>, but then abandoned the idea (Anon
1953iq). The book was written by C. Ranger Gull under the pseudonym of Guy Thorne in the early 1900s.
<li>A novel called <i>Anglo-Saxon Attitudes</i> (Wilson 1956) may have been inspired by the
announcement of the Piltdown forgery.
<li>Fans of Sherlock Holmes briefly discussed the hypothetical question of whether Holmes could have
been behind the Piltdown forgery, or if he could have
exposed it (Boswell 1963; Durrenberger 1965).
<li>The subject of Piltdown Man appeared briefly in a 1981 book called <i>Mask of the Jaguar</i> (North
1981: 137-8). The name of the author, Jessica North, is a
pseudonym for an ex-anthropology lecturer.
<li>A word of warning about <i>Skullduggery: A Novel</i>, by Peter Marks (1987). This is a poorly written
book pretending to be historical fiction, incorporating Oakley, Weiner, Dawson, Woodward and Conan
Doyle as some of its characters. Although
there is evidence of some degree of research into Piltdown (inspired by Winslow & Meyer), the author takes
&quot;artistic&quot; license a little too far when he details Dawson as a womanizer, Oakley having erotic
musings about fellow train passengers, and Woodward as a bisexual with a taste for bondage and young
French men. This book is best avoided.
<li>Ralph Lombreglia wrote a short story in 1993 called <i>Piltdown Man, Later Proved to Be a Hoax</i>,
which was reprinted a year later (Lombreglia 1993; 1994: 103-26).
<li>Irwin Schwartz wrote a book in 1994 that seems to exist under three different
titles: <i>The Piltdown Conspiracy</i>, <i>The Piltdown Affair: Memoir of a Hoaxer</i>, and <i>The
Piltdown Confession: a novel</i>. It does an excellent
job of pretending to be a true story; the book also explores a religious
subtext within the plot.
<li>Milner Place published a poem in 1994 called &quot;Piltdown man and bat woman&quot;, in a British
poetry magazine called
<a href="http://www.cs.man.uk/peve/Staff/Jon/Poetry/spout.html"><i>Spout</i></a>.
</ul><p>

<b>Music</b><p>
There's quite a bit of this, strangely enough. I tracked all of this
down on the web.<p>

<ul><li>A 1950s and 1960s band was called <i>The Piltdown Men</i>. Two of their hits were
&quot;MacDonald's Cave&quot; and
<a href="http://www.houseofmusic.com/bronto.ram">&quot;Brontosaurus Stomp&quot;</a>.
The latter song requires Streaming Real Audio 3.0 . The site it's on is very
busy - just keep clicking the Real Audio 'play' button over and over until it connects.
<li>In 1963 a group called <i>The Terry Young Six</i> recorded a single
under the name <i>The Sons of Piltdown Men</i>, which contained a
song called &quot;Mad Goose&quot;. This has apparently been re-released
on a CD called &quot;Instrumental Diamonds Volume 3 - Out of this World&quot;.
<li>There was an album and tape called &quot;Piltdown Lad&quot; released by a Washington D.C.
band, <i>Fidelity Jones</i>. I don't know the year but the earliest it could have
been was 1988.
<li>An Australian group called <i>Blat</i> released a tape in mid-1990
called &quot;Piltdown Man&quot;.
<li>A band formed in 1995 named <i>The Armadillos</i>, in Charlottesville, Virginia, has a song called
&quot;Piltdown Man&quot;, which is about &quot;whether it is better to have lived and died or to never
have lived at all&quot;.
<li>Mike Oldfield's 1973 album <i>Tubular Bells</i> listed &quot;Piltdown Man&quot; as one of his
instruments because he was singing like a caveman.
<li>The University of California (San Francisco) had a music program
on May 4th 1997 which included the premiere of a contemporary orchestral
piece by John Lowrie, <i>Conversations with Piltdown Man</i>.
<li>Walter Ross composed a piece of tuba music called <i>Piltdown fragments</i> in 1975, which was
published by Crystal Records in 1978.
<li><i>Piltdown Man</i> is the name of a Christian band in Atlanta, Georgia. (~1996)
<li>There is a New York City band (1997) using the name <i>The Piltdown Men</i>, which has Richard
Berman (possibly the folk musician of the same name?) as bass player.
</ul>

<b>Other media</b><p>

Anything else that didn't fit. Most of these are minor miscellanea.<p>

<ul><li>The department of anthropology at the University of California (Riverside)
once published something called <i>Piltdown Newsletter</i>. I have found out from
someone there that it's just a plain anthropology newsletter, and that for some reason Piltdown ended up
being chosen for the title.
<li>On August 11, 1986, there was a reading for a play called <i>Missing Links</i> by Attilio Favorini,
concerning Arthur Conan Doyle's involvement in Piltdown (Gilmour 1986). This happened at the
Three Rivers Shakespeare Festival, which I think is either in Ohio or Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where
Favorini teaches theater arts in the Medieval and Renaissance Studies Program at the University of
Pittsburgh.
<li>The LucasArts computer adventure game based on Steve Purcell's characters, <i>Sam &amp; Max Hit
the Road</i>, has Sam commenting about tacky jackalope toys (half jackrabbit, half antelope) being sold in
a large restaurant chain: &quot;Jackalopes. The bastard pets of Piltdown Man.&quot;
<li>There is a wonderfully crazy comic book by
<a href="mailto:rwalton@cancopy.com">Rob Walton</a> called <i>Ragmop</i>, published
by Planet Lucy Press. I can't really describe it so you should either click
<a href="http://onramp.i2k.com/~verbeek/books/Ragmop.html">here</a> or
<a href="http://www.people.hbs.edu/msheridan/groovepit/comics/rag.html">here</a>.
In the later issues, Piltdown Man shows up as a character. What follows is a
rather amusing panel that appears in issue 10. However, let me explain the context
of the joke first. The main chacarters of the story have journeyed to Heaven to
recover an object of great power. At the same time, a group of disgruntled
devils are attacking the angels, and with the huge fight going on, the main characters can't reach the locked
vault. &quot;We need a destraction, Piltdown Man,&quot;
says one of them. &quot;A distraction, eeeeh...?&quot; Piltdown Man replies craftily.
And so, Piltdown Man interrupts the battle with a musical song on how both sides
should give up their pride and apologize to one another. Soon all the devils and
angels are singing along, and eventually Piltdown Man leads them all away in a
big parade. When suddenly, the jig is up!...<br>
<a href="http://www.net/~george/ragmop.gif"><img src="http://www.net/~george/clckhere.gif"></a>
<li>I've been told there's a comic book with a character called &quot;The Piltdown
Pig&quot;, but I am awaiting further information.
