<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Introduction</font></h2></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">I suppose my career in MotorSport started
as result of realising I neededto channel my driving enthusiasm into something
more productive than driving around narrow roads as quickly as I could
whilst listening to <a href="http://www.deep-purple.com/">Deep Purple</a>!
I found out somehow (I can't remember how) that <a href="../uk.html">motorsport
in the UK</a> was governed by the <a href="../uk_govern.html">MSA</a> and
a phone call produced a list of local <a href="../uk_clubs.html">motor
clubs</a> for the <a href="http://www.brighton.co.uk/">Brighton area</a>.These
included <a href="../acsmc/member_clubs.html">Brighton and Hove Motor Club</a>
which runs the <a href="../uk_speed.html">National Speed Trials</a> each
year on the seafront, Sussex Car Club which runs <a href="../uk_speed.html">sprints</a>
at <a href="http://www.goodwood.co.uk/">Goodwood</a>, <a href="../acsmc/member_clubs.html">Crawley
MC</a>, and <a href="http://www.BBAexpress.com/central_sussex_mc/">Central
Sussex MC</a>.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I knew that I was interested in <a href="../rallying.html">rallying
</a>since
<a href="../uk_circuit.html">racing</a>
appeared to be beyond my limited budget. At the time (1989) I was a student
at <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/">TheUniversity of Sussex</a> in the
<a href="http://www.cpes.sussex.ac.uk/">Chemistry
Department</a>. I decided that <a href="http://www.BBAexpress.com/central_sussex_mc/">Central
Sussex MC (CENSUS)</a> was the club for me because:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Its' club meetings were hidden in deepest
Sussex (at the Raven Hotel, nr. Horsted Keynes at that time) down some
wobbly yellow roads</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">CENSUS ran these <a href="../road_rally.html">12-car
things</a> that seemed to allow <a href="../rallying_uk_road.html">rallying
on the public highway</a></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Its' members actually spoke to new persons
such as <a href="john_ms.html">myself</a></font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">My first car (1985) was a Ford Escort Mk.1
1100 which cost &pound;200.This lasted for a year when I sold it for &pound;250
to the Rottingdean butchers son who thought it was a quick car! At this
point in time I had no interest in rallying. The Mk.1 was replaced by a
Ford Escort Mk2 1600Sport which I found to be rather more sporty but way
beyond my driving skills at the time. Much fun / incidents later this was
replaced by a Ford Escort Mk2 Harrier which was very nearly a Mexico/RS
1600 type vehicle.The sportiness of these cars generated an interest in
<a href="../rallying.html">rallying
</a>and
I joined CENSUS hoping to start
<a href="../rallying_uk_stage.html">stage
rallying </a>very shortly. How naieve you are thinking! Anyway, I was persuaded
to think a little more down to earth and try a <a href="../road_rally.html">12-car
</a>or
two.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Meanwhile, I had moved from Brighton to
Hove in 1989, and whilst walking the streets one night (as one does!),
noticed a lonely looking yellow car that had an unusual shape. It had a
<i>For
Sale</i> notice in it whichcaused some thoughts to pass through my mind
(quite unusual of course).This car was a <a href="http://www.johnupham.org.uk/vixen/">TVR
Vixen Series 3</a>. I did some research and found the car to have</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">A Ford Kent crossflow 1600 GT engine as standard</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">A full 3D space-frame chassis</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">A GRP body shell (i.e. no rusting!)</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Ford / Triumph mechanical parts (cheap and
readily available)</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">To cut a long story short, I bought the car
and persuaded another student (Chris Dalby) to find out what was needed
in order to navigate on one ofthese <a href="../road_rally.html">12-car
things</a>. We entered the`Skoda Surprise' Navigational Exercise which
was run by CENSUS on <a href="http://www.ordsvy.gov.uk/">OS</a>198 ( <a href="http://www.brighton.co.uk/">Brighton</a>
and the Downs) with Bob France as CoC. With my tinkering the Vixen was
now equipped with twin 45 DHLA Dellorto's, giving nearly 150 bhp as opposed
to 87 bhp as standard. We were a little late getting to the start and I
floored the throttle coming out of the uphill hairpin-left near Ditchling
Beacon. Sadly, the diff (GT6) crown wheel dropped a tooth and we ground
to a halt. This was my very first DNF!</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Luckily, I got involved with Mike Wynn
and we became a team to do 12-cars.Our first full 12-car season (1990)
resulted in Mike winning the club championshipand I was runner-up in the
drivers championship. This was irritating since we had only done events
together! We marshalled on the NightWatchman Rally in 1990 and, because
of the freezing fog, we made a pact to compete rather than stand out in
the cold.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My first full-blown restricted status <a href="../rallying_uk_road.html">road
rally</a> came in April 1991 with Basingstoke MC's <i>Tour of <a href="http://www.hants.gov.uk/">Hampshire</a>
Rally</i>. Paul Beeson volunteered to come out of retirement and navigate
me round <a href="http://www.hants.gov.uk/">Hampshires lanes</a>. We finished
9<sup>th</sup> o/a and I instantly became an expert (so I was told!), denying
me the chance of picking-up lesser awards when my results were included
in the seeding. This has always made me think that only navigators results
should be used or seeding.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Paul and I also did the <i>Cascades Rally</i>
in 1991 and were 12<sup>th</sup>o/a after a wrong-direction into a <a href="../hartmc/rr_lesson_2.html">time
control</a>. Paul was absolutely brilliant in Kent as he knew it so well.I
will never forget the pace that we were able to achieve on that event and
I can still remember being completely soaked in sweat as I drove thecar
like I had never before. Sadly, Paul had already retired from road rallying
and was merely helping me out as an up and coming driver. I won the ASEMC
novice award in 1991 and was even mentioned in <i>Motoring News</i>!</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For 1992 Mike Wynn and I teamed up and
decided to have a good go at various events on a more serious level. We
ended up 4<sup>th</sup> o/a in the ACSMC championship at our first attempt
after a year of steep learning.Although we hadn't done very well (i.e.
top 5) in any event that year I felt we were improving at such a rate that
1993 would be a good year. 1992's ACSMC championship was won by Roger Davidson
navigating for Mick `The Vest' Smith, both of <a href="http://www.windsorcarclub.co.uk/">Windsor
Car Club</a>.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Sadly, Mikes committments changed and geographical
reasons led to Mike partnering Jon Richardson in the pink Alfa-Sud which
they eventually took to overall victory in the 1993 ACSMC championship.
A thoroughly deserved win for two sporting characters. I had moved to Yateley
mid - way through1993 as I had landed a post in the <a href="http://www.chem.rdg.ac.uk/">Chemistry
Department</a> of <a href="http://www.rdg.ac.uk/">The University of Reading</a>.
By sheer fluke, one day, I bumped into this weird looking character in
the corridor. This person was large, had a strange mode of dress and was,
(you'ved guessed it) <a href="http://www.publiconline.co.uk/prar/">PRAR</a>.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">PRAR and I competed for a season but numerous
instances of bad luck mainly with mechanical problems never gave us the
results we deserved: to finish first you must first finish!</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">By this time I had joined <a href="../hartmc/index.html">The
Hart Motor Club</a> and had decided to try my hand at navigating ('cos
it's cheaper) and teamed up with Tim Warburton in his talking Renault 11TXE.
By the end of our first season (1994) I had won the <a href="../hartmc/holder_nav.html">Hart
Challenge 12-car Navigators Championship</a> with one round to spare and
Tim was lined up to win the corresponding <a href="../hartmc/nov_driv.html">Drivers
Championship</a> but sadly we went off on the final round near Mill Court
(186/?) and damaged the suspension.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">During that year I started navigating on
National-B road rallies concentrating on the LCAMC Championship with Tim
and Keith Taylor. By virtue of a very consistent year I managed to achieve
2<sup>nd</sup> o/a in the LCAMC Championship to superstar Pete Tilling
with Cath Woodman in third place. This was a considerable result for someone
with such little experience in the days when there was considerable depth
in the entries .</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In 1998 I decided to try my hand at stage
rally co-driving and kicked off with the Multi-Venue <a href="http://www.tcs01.demon.co.uk/1999/somerset/index.html">Gliddon's
Somerset Stages </a>(run by Mindehead MC and Burnham-on-Sea MC) with David
Perellet in his Group N Peugeot 1.9 205 GTi. It rained heavily all week-end
making the red Somerset clay very slippery indeed. An off in SS5 (KnowleHill)
ended the day prematurely.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Neil Prior invited me to co-drive at the
famous Abingdon CAR-nival Stages around the asphalt airfield venue in his
forest spec 230bhp Escort Mk.2. Unfortunately, a wet - sump lubrication
system combined with the long open corners of Abingdon blew the bottom
end of the engine during SS2 which put paid to that days entertainment.
One rebuilt engine later and we entered the Brookwood Motor Sport Stages
run by Craven MC at Longcross, Chertsey. A very sideways days entertainment
gave us a top ten place with a forest set-up car.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In 1999 I teamed up with South African
born Alex Mack to do the Peugeot<img SRC="../images/106cup.jpg" ALT="Super 106 Cup" BORDER=0 height=38 width=200 align=ABSCENTER>
in a Peugeot 106 S16. We acheived 27<sup>th</sup> o/a on the superb <a href="http://www.personal.u-net.com/~vox1/astra1.htm">Astra
Stages </a>first time out and won "Best Improvement on Seeding" (140 ->
35) on the <a href="http://www.tcs01.demon.co.uk/1999/somerset/index.html">Gliddon's
Somerset Stages</a> on our second rally.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">By now, Tim Warbuton had returned from
Hong Kong and was determined to go rallying once more. The old team was
re-established using the ex-Andy Rowe 1300 Vauxhall Nova. First stage rally
for us together gave us 4<sup>th </sup>in class at Longcross with a car
struggling in the 1400 class. Our second rally was the Performance Parts
Tempest Stages where we won our class and came 27<sup>th</sup> o/a. I had,
by now, upgraded my licence to National-A.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mid-August I had a call from Colin Minton
(Craven MC) who asked me if I'd like to do the <a href="http://www.mir.co.im/">Sony
Manx International </a>in an Escort Cosworth RS. About ten seconds later
I said yes and upgraded my licence to International Rally. We had a good
rally until the notoriously weak Ford Group N gearbox lost 1<sup>st</sup>,
2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd </sup>gears and then the clutch expired on
SS6.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I joined the International Rally Drivers
Club and obtained an MSA International Rally Licence (number 16) at the
same time.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">During 2000 I have been contesting the
Peugeot Super 106 Cup with Steve Trotter and some BTRDA rounds with Matthew
Fowle in a Group A 306 S16, but with a 5 speed gearbox.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the AGM of the Hart Motor Club, I was
voted in as Chairman of the club which was a considerable honour.</font>
