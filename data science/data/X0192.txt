<h3>Question</h3>

<p>Hello,
  Thanks so much for your web site. I have spent so much time in search for a low key site that could answer some of my questions, and I found it in yours! so THANKS! My question has to do with Coaching clinics. I live in California and am a player and fan of the game. I am now 27 and the gym that I am of a member of is buliding a new state of the art b-ball gym to instruct b-ball drills have clinics and have a city leauge and summer b-ball camps. My heart is in coaching b-ball but due to the owners request all coaches and trainers/teachers must be certified in some way. Now I have played this wonderfull game as long as I  can remember . Through  grade school,high school, and some collage. But now what I  need is to know if there are clinics that I can attend that will certify. Like I said I live in California, so it would help if you knew any clinics in this state for coaches. I  can understand the owner of the gym and where he is coming from so I  hope to find some clinics that will help  with the challenge</p>

<h3>Question</h3>

<p>I am coaching a team in our Boys and Girls club summer league ages 10-14... The team we
are playing tomorrow just beat us last fri and thier pt guard had 30 pts he is clearly the
best player in our league....but he has a good team around him as well he can score from
the perimeter and create for him self off of the dribble and if we double him he dishes to
the open man for a easy lay up the also have a small forward who is deadly form the
outside...what defense could i use to contain him and make the other players beat me? 

<p>thanks 

<p>Michael 

<h3>Answer</h3>

<p>There's no magic defense to counter a solid team that has good shooters. Sometimes you
just need to face the fact that the opponent's star is going to hurt you no matter what
you do. In that case, I'd probably settle for trying to make him score from the outside
and hope for the best. The worst damage is when the star makes everyone else better by
setting them up for good shots. So, you might try a basic zone and keep everyone within
the perimeter. Don't panic when the star knocks down some long threes and don't blame
yourself when he gets 30+ points. He'd probably get them anyway.</p>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>How do I improve my JUMPING so that I'm able to dunk ? In order to dunk, do I also need
  to know how to grip the ball tight ?</p>
  <h3>Answer</h3>
  <p>To improve jumping, you need to lift weights and practice jumping, of all things. How
  many times can you touch the bottom of the backboard in 15 seconds? Once? Twice? Work at
  it until you can touch it 20 times in 15 seconds. If your hands are too small, you're not
  going to be able to palm it. You might try cradling it against your forearm. <hr>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>Ok i got alot of big kids with few ball skills , one point guard and one average off
  guard , what offence and defense(s) would you run ?</p>
  <h3>Answer</h3>
  <p>I'd use a standard 3 out 2 in setup. I'd tell my big guys to either shoot (most of the
  time) or pass, but avoid dribbling until they get it down in practice. The guards should
  learn to pass to them and then MOVE, either for a handoff or to an open area for a jumper.

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p> Hi, My name is Lindsay. I want to go out for the school basketball team next year but
  the problem is i don't know tha first thing about basketball. I mean i know the obvious
  stuff, but i don't know all the positions and what the jobs of those positions are. I was
  wondering if you could give me any information on the positions and rules. thanks loads,
  Lindsay <h3>Answer</h3>
  <p>You sound like a perfect 2 guard. That's not a point guard, its the shooting guard
  position. You're the right size, quickness and have the shooting ability.</p>
  <p>Here are some jobs for the shooting guard.</p>
  <p>Help the point guard bring the ball up the floor. Don't do the dribbling, just be there
  to get the pass when she feels defensive pressure, then give the ball back.</p>
  <p>Work hard to get open. Go to a wing (somewhere near the three point line, about a 45
  degree angle to the basket), then get open for a pass. Ways to do that ... run to the
  baseline (out of bounds under the basket) and back, or go close to the basket and run
  around a team mate then return. Its hard work, but you'll always be open for a pass and
  then you can shoot. <p>Don't shoot every time you get the ball, just when you are nice and
  open. <p>Work really hard on defense. If your man has the ball, make her stop dribbling
  then get close and make it hard to pass. Don't foul. If your man doesn't have the ball,
  don't ever let her get a pass. Try to steal passes, not dribbles. <p>That's probably a
  good start for now. You are young and have lots of time to get better, so don't get
  discouraged when things don't go well. There are always good times to offset the bad. And,
  listen to your coach. <p>Good luck. I wish you well.</p>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>what is the difference between man and zone in basketball?</p>
  <h3> Answer</h3>
  <p>Good question! In a man to man (m2m) defense, each player is responsible for guarding a
  particular opponent. There may be cases where you might trade with one of your teammates,
  or times when you might gang up two against one, but in general each person on your team
  is guarding only one person on the other team. In a zone, each defender is responsible for
  guarding an area of the court. When a person with the ball is in your area (no matter who
  the person is) you are expected to guard that player. You pretty much stay in your area,
  or zone, all the time you are on defense. <p>One good way to see if another team is
  playing zone is to have one of your players go from a wing position, through the defense
  and out the other side. If somebody follows your player, you have m2m coverage. If the
  defenders stay in place, its a zone. <p>If you have more questions, write back. <hr>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>Is it okay for coaches to hug and slap players on their bottoms? Your input is
  appreciated. </p>
  <h3>Answer</h3>
  <p>I don't do it. It used to be common, but coaches are moving away from having physical
  contact with the players. It isn't necessary and it can be very awkward, especially if the
  genders differ between the coach and the players. Parents have a right to object to such
  contact and so do the players. If the coach is asked to stop, he/she should immediately.
  Feelings may be hurt as the coach may have had only the best of intentions, but it's not
  appropriate in my opinion. <p> <p>Now, basketball is a passionate game. If at the end of
  an emotional game, or at the end of a season, a player came to me and gave me a hug (and
  that has happened), I'd return it and feel pretty happy about it. But I won't initiate a
  hug or a slap on the rear. <p>In practice, I find it necessary to move players, so I tug
  their jersey. Last season, in the first practice, I explained to the players why I will
  tug onthe jersey and asked if anyone had a problem with it. No one objected, so that's the
  method of contact we used. <hr>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>Hi <p>I am a coach of an Under 16 girls representative team in Sydney Australia and i
  would love to get your opinion and advice on the following question: <p>How would you
  handle a team when half the team is very committed and the other half is not. WE have the
  problem of some girls missing training and not playing some games as they are too busy. I
  feel sorry for the girls who are committed and are showing great promise as they work hard
  and attend every training. <p>WE do not have a chance to cut players as there is no one
  waiting in the wings to take their spot.....i can reduce court time and give them physical
  penalties at training but there is not much else i can think to do. <p>The team
  performance definitely suffers but its a no win situation.....if i cut some players and
  dont allow them to play we go to games undermanned and the girls who do play get tired and
  we dont have enough subs.....or i let the non committed girls play and they lack the skill
  and knowledge and let us down inevitably but they assist in reducing fatigue for the team
  as i have more players to rotate. <p>Girls are hard at this age when they still want to do
  all different sports and the way our basketball system works we dont have many choices in
  training times or choices in athletes! <p>Help! <p>REgards<br>

  <h3>Answer</h3>
  <p>We have a similar problem in our smaller Alaskan schools where the student body is
  small yet there are many available activities that end up competing for participants. Its
  a great environment for the kids as they can try so many things. Its tough for a coach, or
  a team, that wants a higher degree of commitment to excel. <p>I think you need to be very
  pragmatic. You can't force the other half of the team to be more committed and you can't
  afford to cut them. In fact, punishing them with more bench time will actually be
  detrimental to your cause. If they aren't having fun, why should they show up at all?
  About the only answer is for the team to be the most important thing for them. You can do
  that by making it so much fun they don't want to do anything else, or help them feel that
  their participation is essential enough they feel more obligated to excel. For instance,
  if they had roles more significant than just resting the main players, maybe their
  interest would heighten. I used the word pragmatic earlier because you may not be able to
  improve this situation at all. You can still set achievable team goals so the committed
  girls attain a sense of success. If your players are having fun and improving, its bound
  to influence more future players to want to join up with you. It takes time to build a
  full team in a small community. But when you do, you may create a tradition the community
  is known for. <hr>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>dear coach, i would like to be in the tecnichal staff of an nba team...can you tell me
  if this is possible. perhaps my presentation is not as well as i would desire but i thinck
  i am a very good coach, and i need some foreiners experience. <p> can you help
  me....thanks... <p> im looking forward to hear you. josean</p>
  <h3>Answer</h3>
  <p>Anything is possible. You will need some good contacts and recommendations to help you
  reach your goal. Where can you work right now? You need to build a portfolio - samples of
  your work. You need to meet people who know people who work where you want to work. As you
  make friends and impress others with the quality of your work, you can ask them to
  recommend you to someone at a higher level. Good luck. Give yourself enough time to
  realize your dream. It may take a while, but you can make a lot of friends along the way. <hr>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>what are the different positions in the game(basketball)?</p>
  <h3>Answer</h3>
  <p>Usually teams have a center (typically the biggest player) also referred to as the 5
  position. Postions 4 and 3 are forwards, the player playing closer to the basket is the
  power forward and the other foward may play awayfrom th basket more and is called a small
  forward or a swing man. The guard roles are a little more distinctive. The point guard,
  position 1, is the primary ball handler and is used to bring the ball upcourt and set up
  the offense. Position 2 is the shooting guard who may also have excellent ballhandling
  skills, but is more likely to be the player most likey to take outside shots. Of course,
  the coach may alter these roles any way possible to best fit the talents of the team.</p>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>any ideas on drills that can improve dribbling skills....i have always like the drill
  using chairs and weaving back and forth...how about doing that drill with two basketballs?
  also, what have you done to best teach the crossover drill and get some success from
  players, instead of the inevitable steal as they put the ball in front of the defender.?</p>
  <h3>Answer</h3>
  <p>Using two balls at once is a great idea. It forces a great deal of concentration. I ask
  the kids to dribble two basketballs, sometimes using alternating left-right-left dribbles
  or have both basketballs strike the floor at the same time. You can do the weaving drills
  or another fun idea is to have relay races.</p>
  <p>For cross-overs, I like the step back and switch hands, the behind the back and the
  through legs cross overs. I insist that the player try to make space for protection (the
  step back is the safest), keep the dribble low and very firmly bounced, and always face
  the basket - do not turn your back to the defender. For this reason I don't teach a spin
  move. Too often a player gets in the habit of spinning and they always spin their favorite
  way. A smart defender will anticipate and steal the dribble while the back is turned. Keep
  the players eyes up and looking down the floor at all times. Ask them how many fingers
  you're holding up to check. To practice the cross over, I have them dribble down the side
  of the court. Right before half court (where I am waiting), I jump them, and they have to
  cross to avoid me. Once the reach the baseline, they come up the other side and cross over
  on front of the assistant coach. You can add more uncontested cross over point along the
  route if you wish. If all the kids have a basketball, this drill is active and fun.</p>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>My 9 year old son has had 3 severe ankle sprains in the last year. Is there a
  particular brand, make or type of ankle brace or any other product that you can recomend?
  Thank you. Guillermo Quezada. </p>
  <h3>Answer</h3>
  <p>Well, the key is for your son's ankle to get stronger so that it can stand the rigors
  of basketball. Often a brace creates a dependency. It may be that your son needs a year of
  low risk exercise to let the ankle fully heal and get stronger. The last thing you want to
  do is foster a chronic condition for the sake of basketball. Check with a sports doctor in
  your area for professional advice. I'm just a coach. Your doctor may likely have a better
  answer.</p>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>I coach a 4th grade tournament basketball team. I love coaching the forwards position
  and have always developed good forwards and inside games. One of my weak areas is in
  coaching the guard position. Do you have a suggestion on where I can get educated on
  coaching this position. It could be a book or video. I am open for ideas. Thanks, </p>
  <h3>Answer</h3>
  <p>I am just the reverse. I think like a guard. This year I had an assistant coach who is
  a big guy. He could work with the post people and I could listen in and learn. You can
  pick up a lot listening to other coaches. You don't necessarily need to have been a guard
  to teach guards. As far as a specific book or video, I am sorry, but I do not have a
  recommendation. <hr>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>The 20 Drill looks great. However, it would be to the passer/screeners advantage to not
  do his best to help the shooter since the passer/screener can only score points for
  himself when he advances to the shooter position. And helping the shooter to score is
  lessening the passer/screeners chance of winning this competitive drill. <p> I am not
  saying that the kids are necessarily bad sports, but for some of them, the allure of
  winning this drill may influence how they play it. Especially when the shooter gets close
  to 20 points. I can see how this drill could have the added advantage of building
  character, but do you have any specific tips on how to make this work?</p>
  <h3>Answer</h3>
  <p>You're correct, of course. I did not see this happen when we played the game, but it
  could. Remedies would be to have the coach play that spot all the time. Or, you could say
  that the passer screener shares points with the scorer. That would motivate both to
  succeed.</p>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>coach, I coach an 8th grade boys team that is trying to stay in shape for next year. I
  found out that half the team never played much against the 2-3 zone which is very popular
  in our division. What is the easiest to learn and best offense to combat this? Thanks john</p>

  <p>Hmmm... this is similar to the question below. Once they understand overload
  principles, plays aren't all that necessary. However, I recommend you read the Easy<a href="easyplays.html"> Offensive Sets artic</a>le and look at the play called Hi-Lo. Super
  easy to learn and it features an overload that follows the ball and a reversal to the weak
  side for a quick shot. You can run the pattern over and over until the defense breaks
  down. Give it a try. <hr>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>I need an effective half court press break against a 2-3 trapping zone.</p>
  <h3>Answer</h3>
  <p>The recipe for breaking zone presses is all the same. Put your people where they are
  not. Against a 2-3, you might start in a 1-2-2. Then have one of the bottom 2 guys move to
  the free throw line on the same side as the other bottom guy. Now you have an overload.
  Quick passing will exploit your numbers advantage. Another way is to simply get the ball
  up court as fast as you can and don't let them get set up. That is the zone's most
  vulnerable moment. Do not dribble, especially near traps. Once the trap begins to show,
  pass. Once your trapped, you're dead meat. Pass receivers should recognize the open areas
  on the floor created when the trap forms. It takes two defenders to make a trap. That
  means somebody's open. That somebody should move to the open area and call for the ball.</p>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>Thank you for this web-site. I am coaching a 5th grade girls team. The majority of the
  girls have never touched a basketball or even thought of being on a team. I have decided
  to keep things simple with a 1-3-1 offense and a 2-3 defense. This is a starter league
  that only consists of 6 games and very little practice time. My question is, am I on the
  right track?</p>
  <p>I think your off to a great start. You're wise to keep it simple. Make sure the girls
  maintain good spacing in both their offense and defense. In the 2-3, the girls away from
  the ball are very important. They need to &quot;cheat&quot;, sag into the key, when the
  ball is away and then jump out to the ball when it is on their side. Offensively, the 131
  is good because you always have a scoring threat in the middle. With simple O and D, you
  can focus your limited practice time on ballhandling, passing and shooting. Good job.</p>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>How do i get post players to score more.</p>
  <h3>Answer</h3>
  <p>There are two parts to this answer. One, make sure they get the ball often in the game.
  Most young teams are dominated by their guards and young guards are notoriously selfish
  with the ball. The main reason kids don't play post on the playground is because they get
  ignored. Some coaches state that no one take a shot until a big guy touches the ball and
  that's a good rule. When you watch your next game, see how many times your team has the
  ball and of those, how many times the ball is passed to a post.</p>
  <p>The second part is to develop post play. Big man skills take time to learn. Kids that
  master them will always have a place to play ... assuming the guards throw them the ball.
  Look at my article, &quot;Deve<a href="bigplayer.html">loping your Big Player</a>&quot;
  for a starter.</p>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>how can i build muscle fast for my upper body and legs</p>
  <h3>Answer</h3>
  <p>Simply stated, eat good food, get lots of rest and work out with weights. Now, one
  thing I don't do is make specific recommendations on weight workouts because I don't know
  anything about you. I'm sure you have a teacher or a local health club rep that can help
  you out.</p>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>Hello, My question is how do the defense really play a matchup zone?. What are the
  assignments for each player?and why would a team want to play a match up zone and not play
  man to man or 3-2/ 2-3 zone. I coach a 7th grade AAU team, my forwards are very tall and
  not really quick and I perfer to play man to man. Seveal good teams used their speed when
  we played man to man by taking my big men out and driving to the basket on them. I was
  thanking a matchup zone may give us good intensity and keep my big men close to the
  basket.</p>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>I have a real young girls basketball team, these are, Jr. girls playing at their first
  year at the Sr. level. They all have talent but lack the experience of this level, I
  remind them ALL the time that the experience will come, and good things will happen if we
  keep working hard and give 110% in every practice and game. We have lost ( almost ) all
  our games but never a blow - out, ( within 2 - 14 points ) which I tell them they should
  be proud of because they are playing experienced players . Anyways, they are lacking the
  confidence in themselves and go into games thinking / saying they suck and are going to
  get beat, (which approach should I take from here on? )</p>
  <h3>Answer&gt; </h3>
  <p>As my sons advanced, they went through the same weak team/strong team cycle playing in
  5th/6th, 7th/8th, etc. divisions. The weak year, winning half the games was the goal. The
  strong year, winning the championship was the goal. We usually didn't achieve either.
  Actually, with your margins as close as they are, you are doing very well. </p>
  <p>One nice thing about being an under-dog is that the wins you do get are so sweet. You
  can take them out for treats or host a party if they win. Always try to get them to look
  to the future, though. In a couple years, they will have long forgotten this year's w/l
  records, but they will remember the fun they had and the skills they learned. Try to get
  them in the mindset of planning ahead for their next season. And, maybe they will relish
  the role of being an upset team - the spoilers. Make the upsets their mission, and if they
  accept that, every game becomes an exciting story. Good luck - I wish I had a magic
  answer, but its a year of character building as well as skill development.</p>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>Hi. I think your site is great and I have used plenty of your plays and drills. I
  really need some advice. I have been coaching girls 7th-8th grade basketball for the past
  3 years. This year is our first year without a solid point guard. I have a few girls who
  have decent ball handling skills but we are having problems getting into any type of
  offense. We're having trouble initiating any type of offense and part of that has to do
  with players getting open on the wings but there is always the issue of not having strong
  guard play. We do have a plentiful amount of forward type players. Do you have any
  suggestions on a type of offense or style of play? It is about mid way through a very
  tough season and we are trying to avoid any further embarassment for the players as well
  as the coaches. Any suggestions or advice would be truly appreciated. Thanks.</p>
  <h3>Answer</h3>
  <p>Guards are the most influential players at that age. If your guards are weak, the
  season will be a struggle. I have been on both sides of that situation. Look first at your
  wings. It is very common for the wings to be too stationary. They should work very hard
  and very early to get open. A jab step or two once the point guard is in place is too
  little and too late. I want my wings to go all the way to the baseline and back, or around
  the post, or to the baseline and out the other side to get open. That makes the point
  guard's job much easier. Then, instead of dribbling, she can pass early. I like my point
  to pass and pick away. This causes a rotation on the top so all three perimeter players
  are at the point eventually. That would work for you, too. Another way to get the ball to
  the wing is simply dribble there while the wing exchanges to the top.</p>
  <p>You may be having trouble passing from the wing to the post as well. Break your team
  down into pairs and practice this element 2:2. Inexperienced guards usually lack subtle
  skills like faking and creating space with their body and stepping through the defense to
  execute passes. 2:2 can expose such elements. I also have a guantlet drill on the site
  that may help.</p>
  <p>Your offense needs to be simple. Try the 2-Lo or Hi-Lo in the article Easy offensive
  sets. If you think your players are more advanced, try the Alaska Play. The Alaska Play is
  a basic motion offense with rules to keep things organized. </p>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>Coach, what is the best way to beat a team that has 2 guards picking up my point guard
  right when she crosses 1/2 court. I coach a 8th grade girsl team. Thanks <p>Andre Hawkins</p>
  <h3>Answer</h3>
  <p>Pass the ball. I don't mean to simplify your problem, but if you are dependent upon
  your point to bring the ball all the way up the court, you're in trouble. Instead, give
  her passing options. Just before the two guards pick her up, ideally right when they are
  committed to her but before they can trap her, have teammates come towards her on each
  side of the floor, but in the front court. That way she can have a choice, left or right,
  to pass before she meets the defense. The defense will be forced to adjust. Your point can
  either continue and maybe get the ball back or go set a screen for the teammate at the
  sideline who did not get the ball. The screened teammate can then cut toward the ball or
  to the basket. </p>

  <h3>Question</h3>
  <p>i am really interested in coaching girls basketball on the high school level. i am from
  houston,texas and what really made me want to become a coach is one for the love i have
  for the game but secondly i dont really see to many dedicated female coaches in houston. i
  am presently in the Navy and i will soon be going to college. I wanted to ask you what
  courses could i take and what is the best way to become a high school coach. i am 19 now
  and i know i have a long time to get ready but i really want to start early. i am
  respectful requesting answers or tips to get to that level. thanks, SNSA Crystal Jones</p>
  <h3>Answer</h3>
  <p>I wish I had decided to be a high school basketball coach as early as you. I could be
  so much better now. Oh, well. I'll offer you these suggestions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The main reason you should coach is because you love to help kids. Love of the game is
      good and so is improving the presence of women in the coaching ranks. But loving to see
      kids grow up into better people through basketball is the reward you'll savor for a
      lifetime.</li>
    <li>Take the courses you need to establish your career. High school coaching is not a
      career. Teaching is a career and as a teacher the doors to coaching will be very open to
      you. </li>
    <li>You may be able to take elective course related to coaching. Check with your counselor.</li>
    <li>If you decide to work in a non-teaching profession, you will need to work as a volunteer
      assistant for a while. That takes a lot of commitment and dedication. But, you can learn a
      lot from a good mentor coach. Find one and offer your assistance. You'll gain training and
      gain an excellent reference source.</li>
    <li>Coach youth teams - like elementary kids in a YMCA program. You'll have a chance to be a
      head coach and develeop your style and practice your teaching techniques. Young kids play
      very exciting games. Don't worry about not maintaining your interest level!</li>
    <p>Good luck. I wish you success.</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <p>I am coaching a high school girls team, I am having a problem getting them to pass the
    ball, and to control the ball. they panic every time. They will not run a proper offence.
    how do I help this. Tried just about everything.</p>
    <h3>Answer</h3>
    <p>Its hard for me to see the root problems from here. There isn't one magic bullet to
    solve the symptoms you describe. Are the girls confused? Break the game down into little
    bite-sized chunks, literally into working on each individual pass they are supposed to
    make as they come down the floor. Practice every detail by itself that comprises your
    offense - every screen, every pass, every cut. It will take some time, but they will
    gradually pull the parts of the whole game together.</p>
    <p>Sometimes it just takes a little floor leadership. When I am watching my guys struggle,
    I might get in the play myself. I can often spot problems as a player. Also, I notice tha
    the team I am on suddenly seems more organized. That's because they readily relinquish
    leadership to me. However, that won't help them in games, but I try to make teaching
    leadership part of the practice. We talk about eye contact, verbal communication and most
    importantly, team commitment to the game plan. Everybody must buy into the team plan. It
    just takes a maverick or two to throw the plan into chaos. Make them understand that. Ask
    for their patience as they learn to work together because it won't come quickly. If they
    see it as a team goal, they will notice the improvement and take satisfaction in the
    progress. That will build their confidence. But the key is everybody working to make plan
    work and not giving up on it. Good luck.</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <p>Happy New Year! I coach 7th &amp; 8th grade boys. I have a very good 7th grade team
    with a very good 6' 2&quot; player. I like to get him the ball as much as possible in the
    low and high blocks as well as medium range jump shots. Do u have any suggestions or an
    offense we can use. </p>
    <h3>Answer</h3>
    <p>We have an option in out motion offense that says if the post doesn't get the ball from
    the wing within two seconds, he cuts aways from the ball and sets a screen for the other
    post (in this case your tall player). Breaking toward the ball, he is an easier target and
    will get the ball in various locations in the key. Also, he doesn't have his back to the
    basket so much when he gets the ball. The screen can go from low post to low post, or from
    high to low, or even diagonal across the key.</p>
