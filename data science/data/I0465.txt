The stand has probably the best acoustics in the ground and a small gathering of away fans can generate plenty of noise. It's now all-seated, with the seats screwed directly onto the old terracing so the leg-room can be a little minimal and as a result most away fans tend to stand throughout the game. There are some obscured view seats, due to roof-bearing pillars, but since the stand holds some 3,500, this shouldn't be a problem unless the visiting support fills it. There is a non-smoking policy is existence in certain areas of the stand, but the stewards tend to turn a blind eye. There has never been any problem with visiting fans bringing musical instruments; with such good acoustics it would be a shame not to! There is currently a growing desire amongst home fans to return to the North Stand before the club move to their new "state-of-the-art" stadium in around 2004. There's enough room, but it's the segregation aspect that the club are most worried about.

advance through the club, Tel No 01702 304090.
</P><P>The club was recently criticized on Radio 5's 606 program for their
charging policy with both the wheelchair user and the helper having to
pay full price.
</P></p></td></tr></table><BR><table class="entry" cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td><H3 class="entry">Pubs</H3><p><P>There are a few pubs within easy walking distance of the ground, plus plenty more in town and on the sea-front, a natural magnet for visiting fans down for the weekend:
</P></p><TABLE><TR></TR></TABLE><H5 class="entry">The Railway
</H5><P ALIGN=LEFT></P><TABLE><TR></TR></TABLE><p>In East Street opposite Prittlewell Station on the London Liverpool Street line, this pub is very popular for a pre-match drink with home and away fans alike. About 10 mins walk from the ground, it's open all day and offers the normal selection of lagers and beers, as well as a full bar menu at budget prices. There's a pool table and SKY TV and, for the warmer months, an enclosed courtyard. Children are tolerated.
</P></p><H5 class="entry">The Nelson	
</H5><P ALIGN=LEFT></P><TABLE><TR></TR></TABLE><p>Situated in North Road to the south of the ground and about 10 mins walk from the away stand. From the main traffic lights in Victoria Avenue, walk down West Street, past the bookies and chinese takeaway. to the Safeways / BP petrol station and turn left into North Road, which is directly opposite. The Nelson is just 300m up on the right. There are two bars and, whilst not directly banning fans from the saloon bar, the pub encourages them to use the public bar on the side, which is bigger. Open all day and popular with away fans, the bar offers the normal range of lagers and beers, as well as the occasional real ale guest. Bar snacks are available on request, but are generally limited to sandwiches. For the warmer match-days, there is a beer garden with a marquee for those rainier days when the bar becomes full. No SKY TV yet, and there is a pool table in the saloon bar. Children are welcome.
</P></p><H5 class="entry">Spread Eagle	
</H5><P ALIGN=LEFT></P><TABLE><TR></TR></TABLE><p>Situated in Victoria Avenue close to the ground, it is extremely popular on match-day so get there early! Open all day, the bar offers a wide selection of traditional real ales and well-priced food (burger & chips £2.50). Big screen SKY TV is on offer, but the pool table is covered on match-day, mainly due to the amount of people trying to get a drink! There is an enclosed court-yard for the warmer months and popular beer festivals throughout the year.
</P></p><H5 class="entry">Golden Lion	
</H5><P ALIGN=LEFT></P><TABLE><TR></TR></TABLE><p>Situated in Victoria Avenue close to the Spread Eagle and the ground, the pub is very popular on match-days. It used to ban away supporters but times have changed and, although there can be a doorman on some days, it welcomes both home and away fans. The bar stocks the normal array of lagers and beers, whilst sandwiches are on offer at lunchtimes. There is SKY TV and a pool table.
</P></p></td></tr><table><BR><table class="entry" cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td><H3 class="entry">Food</H3><p><P>The Fish House on East Street is renowned as being one of the best chippies in Southend. Whether that be true or not, it is the nearest decent food place to the ground and also has a small restaurant which can seat around 20 people comfortably. The ribs can be recommended. Other take-away outlets that are actually open seem to be limited around the ground; but persevere as the quality of the food inside Roots Hall has dipped markedly! The town centre (about 20 mins walk) has the normal offering of Burger King's and MacDonald's, as well as pubs offering very fine food at a reasonable cost- try Yates's Wine Lodge or The Last Post.
</P></p></td></tr><table><BR><table class="entry" cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td><H3 class="entry">Cash Machines</H3><p><P>The nearest cash machines are a Royal Bank of Scotland and Abbey national at the Safeways / BP petrol station in West Street, about 5 minutes walk from the ground. Other than that, it's a 20 min walk into town for the next nearest cash machine.
</P><P>The Lloyds TSB machine on Victoria Avenue that we previously mentioned is now closed.
</P></p><p>Click <a class="entry" href="http://link.infonow.net/bin/findNow?CLIENT_ID=LINK_ATM" target="_new">here</A> to go to <a class="entry" HREF="http://www.link.co.uk"  TARGET="_NEW">LINKs</a> locate a cash machine page. The local postcode is SS2 6NQ</P></td></tr><table><BR><table class="entry" cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td><H3 class="entry">Bookmakers</H3><p>Home fans now have the benefit of placing bets on that day's games within the ground. There is no such facility for away supporters. There is a Coral bookmakers in East Street which has just been re-furbished.
</P></p><p>Online betting is always available through <a class="entry"

clicking <a class="entry" href="https://www.ladbrokes.co.uk/bet?AFF_ID=121"  TARGET="_NEW">here</a>.</P></td></tr><table><BR><table class="entry" cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td><H3 class="entry">Directions</H3><p>From all directions, leave the M25 at junction 29 and follow the A127 east towards Basildon and Southend. (Be aware than on fine warm days this route can be jammed with day-trippers from the East End and you should leave plenty of time to reach the ground.) Once inside the Southend boundary, continue to follow the A127 towards the town centre, passing Tesco's and the Bell pub, before turning right at the next roundabout into Victoria Avenue. Continue down the hill to the next set of traffic lights; you can see Roots Hall on your right. Duration : between 30 and 45 mins from the M25 depending on traffic and weather conditions.
</P></p></td></tr><table><BR><table class="entry" cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td><H3 class="entry">Parking</H3><p>Unless you get to the ground early, there is not plenty of parking in the surrounding streets; it's bad enough trying to park during the week, let alone on match-day! The best bet is Prittlewell Chase behind the away stand - turn right at the first set of lights by the ground into Fairfax Drive and then right again into the dualled Prittlewell Chase. There is limited parking at the ground but again you have to get there early. 
</P></p></td></tr><table><BR><table class="entry" cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td><H3 class="entry">Train</H3><p>The nearest station is Prittlewell on the Southend-London Liverpool Street line which is about 10mins walk from the ground. Southend-bound trains leave Liverpool Street every 20 mins (at 00, 20 and 40 mins past the hour) and take around an hour. The cost of a return ticket is £9.30 (Jan 2001). Get off at Prittlewell (a small suburban station) and climb the steps at the end of the platform (don't cross the tracks via the footbridge) into East Street. Turn right over the bridge and past The Railway pub. Continue to the traffic lights at Victoria Avenue (with the Fish House on your right) then turn right and walk down the hill to the next set of lights. Turn left into Fairfax Drive and the entrance to the away stand is about 300m on the left. Try www.ger.co.uk for the latest train times and maintenance work information.
</P><P>Southend can also be reached from London Fenchurch Street; this line runs directly into the centre of Southend-on-Sea and maybe the better option for those arriving early or down for the weekend. Southend-bound trains leave London Fenchurch Street frequently (00, 10, 30 and 40 mins past the hour), take around an hour and the cost of a return ticket is £8.90 (Jan 2001).  Get off at Southend Central and at the O'Neill's pub turn right down a short pedestrianised section into Southend's main high street. Roots Hall is about 20 mins walk left, the seafront less than 10 mins right. Try www.c2c-online.co.uk for the latest train times and maintenance work information.

There are plenty of B&B's along the cliffs in Westcliff as well as a few hotels closer to the town centre. There is a Travel Inn next to the Strawberry Fields pub on the A127 near Tesco's, about 5 mins drive from the ground.

There is a good selection of pubs and clubs close to the seafront which attracts clientele from all over the South-East. Recommend Storm Nightclub in Elmer Approach and Chameleon in Lucy Road. Saturday nights on the sea-front tend to be dominated by the "Cruisers", young lads with hi-performance cars and equally hi-performance sound systems who drive up and down the main drag (known as the "Golden Mile") on the sea-front.
</P></p></td></tr><table><BR><table class="entry" cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td><H3 class="entry">Local Attractions</H3><p>Southend-on-Sea as an attraction has improved in leaps and bounds over the past few years and now boasts plenty for all, including the longest pleasure pier in the world (at just over 1¼ miles) which has seen its fair share of fires, the Adventure Island Theme Park, a sea-life centre, and the Kursaal, an entertainment centre offering ten-pin bowling, American pool, amusements and late night drinking. There are also three golf courses, a multiplex cinema, a sports complex, and of course the beaches.
