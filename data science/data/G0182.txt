Detailed here is the simple explanation of a static black hole.  I have a
more complex explanation, but it uses <a href="spacetime.html">spacetime
diagrams</a>.  I figured not everyone was interested in that level of
detail.
<a name="why"><h1>Why is it called a static black hole?</h1>
It has no charge and it is not rotating.  This is your standard,
idealistic, simple black hole.  It is also called a Schwarzschild (Swar -
shild, not Swarts - child) black hole.  The interesting places for this
one are the photon sphere, the event horizon, and the singularity.  What
happens to you near the black hole all depends on your distance in
Schwarzschild radii.  Let us say that you're flying towards a static black
hole in a brand new, top o' the line spaceship. You're approaching the
black hole slowly, since only a fool would charge full-speed into one.
<p>
The black hole itself is very plain and quite difficult to actually see,
presuming that you are looking at a black hole with absolutely no
accretion disk. It's the space around it that is interesting. You see
multiple images of many of the stars. That galaxy that you know is behind
the black hole appears as a ring around the black hole, commonly called an
Einstein ring. Why you see the galaxy at all, when the black hole is
between you and it, and why it appears as a ring is from the bending of
light due to the strong force of gravity of the black hole. Say you have
an iron marble and a bar magnet. If you roll the ball near enough the
magnet, it veers towards the magnet. The marble ends up tracing a slightly
bent path versus the straight path it would have traced had it not
encountered the magnet. Now replace the magnet with the black hole, and
the marble with a light ray, and you've got it. The light from the
'hidden' galaxy peeks around the black hole and looks like a ring. Cool
neh?
<p>
As the ship passes closer, there's a sudden flash to the rear.  Backing up
and hovering, you discover that ... it's the back of your own ship?  Oh,
this is the photon sphere.
<a name="photon"><h1>The Photon Sphere</h1>
Mathematically speaking, the photon sphere occurs at 3/2 the <a
href="schwarzschild.html#radius">Schwarzschild Radius</a>.  It's the only
place where light rays can have (very) unstable orbits around the black
hole.  Why is it called photon sphere?  Photons orbit there ... and it's a
sphere.  You know how it takes a certain speed to stay at a certain
orbit? Satellites closer to the earth must move faster than satellites
farther from the earth or else they will fall onto the planet below.  It's
the same way with a black hole, just the numbers are larger and the
results more dramatic.  As you approach the black hole, you can orbit all
you like.  It's just that the closer you get to it, the faster you've got
to go to stay in orbit and not fly off into space or plummet into the
black hole.
<p>
At the photon sphere the speed you would have to go to stay in orbit is c,
the speed of light, some 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> meters per second.  Say you
hovered your ship in an orbit just above the photon sphere (which would
take tremendous energy, for you'd be going a significant fraction of the
speed of light) and stuck a camera down into the photon sphere (just
suppose...hypothesize).  The back of the camera sends off light rays that
hold temporary orbits around the black hole.  A light ray can bounce off
the back of the camera, orbit around the black hole, and run smack into
the front of the camera.  If you try to move the camera towards the image,
the image receeds.  Why?  Well, think about it.  The view the camera has
is like the view someone would have if they are standing behind it.  If
the camera stands behind someone and they start to move forward, well,
their image receeds.
<p>
I keep saying these light orbits are only temporary, but why is that?  Why
can't a light ray stay in the photon sphere forever?  Firstly, the photon
sphere is a tiny place --- just one precise distance!  A light ray would
have just one chance to hit the right trajectory.  Secondly, things aren't
that precise out there in the universe.  There are all these other light
rays bouncing around, making things very unstable.  A light ray may orbit
the photon sphere for a long time, but, eventually, it will encounter
another light ray and its perfect orbit will be disturbed.  It might go
flying off into space only delayed a thousand years, or it could fall into
the black hole.  You want to argue quantum mechanics and say there is
always the possibility that it would orbit forever?  Fine, but that's one
possibility out of too many to count!
<p>
Okaaaay, the photon sphere is fun, but it loses its charm after a while.
You take the rocket closer to the black hole.  It is now impossible to
orbit the black hole, but it is still possible to stay at a constant
radius --- to hover above the black hole.  Now, you approach the ... event
horizon (the astrophysical thing, not the movie).  The what??
<a name="horiz2"><h1>The Event Horizon</h1>
When people talk about the black hole, they're usually referring to its
event horizon.  The funny thing about the even horizon is that it, just
like the photon sphere, is just a mathematical construct, a distance.  If
you wanted to get theoretical, it is the first sphere of light (which is,
of course, constantly expanding at the speed of light) that does not
expand (due to the extreme curvature of spacetime). Enough, enough, what
is it?! R<sub>s</sub>, the Schwarzschild radius.  What makes it special?
Once something passes beyond the event horizon, it can never leave the
black hole and is doomed to a painful stretchy demise.
<p>
Ah ha, that's interesting.
<p>
Your rocket ship can come close to the event horizon and (by firing all
the rockets at their strongest and wasting a lot of fuel and, not
incidentally, squishing you flat with the acceleration) can move away
from it.  This all has to do with something called escape velocity.  You
know how, when rockets are launched on the earth, they have to go a
certain speed or else they'll just plummet back to the earth?  That's
escape velocity: the speed needed to leave a gravitational field. Want a
peek at the <a href="escape_velocity.html">equation</a> for escape
velocity? Black
holes have escape velocities just like anything else, it's just that the
numbers are orders of magnitude bigger than the escape velocities of
planets.  The closer to the black hole's event horizon, the greater the
escape velocity.  At the event horizon the escape velocity is the speed of
light.  Things with mass can't go the speed of light, so, if they get to
or go closer than R<sub>s</sub>, they cannot escape the black hole.
Beyond the event horizon the escape velocity is greater than the speed of
light.  Light rays that go beyond R<sub>s</sub> can't even get out!
<p>
<a name="horiz1"><h1>Why is it called the event horizon?</h1>
Well, we who-are-further-away-than-R<sub>s</sub> can't see the light rays
emitted by something at R<sub>s</sub>.  Say we had thrown something into
the black hole.  We could see its image get smaller and smaller as it
approached the black hole.  Then it would start to move slower and slower
and get dimmer and dimmer.  The slowing down and the dimming are the
effects of the strong gravitational field.  The thing we threw would slow
down until it seemed as if time had stopped for it, and it would dim until
we needed an infrared detector to see it.  The last image we could see
would be the light emitted just before it crossed the event horizon.  It's
the last event we could see.  Get it?
<p>
BTW, if you stuck your hand past the event horizon of a black hole, you
could pull your arm away (not really; your muscles and bones would snap
from the strain, but let's just be hypothetical for a minute), but the
part of your hand that went past the horizon would forever remain there. 
<p>
While moving towards the event horizon, you look out your front and back
windows (high-tech spaceships have lots of windows --- neat!) because
you're curious about the effects of the gravitational field on light (or
you're just really bored).  The view from the front window is boring, for
all you can see is a large black area getting much bigger.  The back
window is much more interesting.  From the back window you can see the
view of where you came from is ... shrinking?
<p>
Why is this?  Well, it has something to do with a thought-device normally
used when considering the <a href="forming.html">formation</a> of a black
hole.  It's called a <a href="forming.html#cone">light cone</a>.  In short
the cone describes the range of angles that are "escape paths" for light
rays released from a collapsing star.  As the star gets closer and closer
to its Schwarzschild Radius, the light cone gets smaller and smaller.
Eventually, it closes up completely, when the material collapses to its
R<sub>s</sub> and the event horizon forms.  It's kinda the same thing when
you move towards the event horizon and the angular size of your universe
shrinks.  It's the light cone closing up.  Spacetime's way of reminding
you that the chances of you getting away from the black hole are fewer and
fewer the closer you get to the event horizon.  At the event horizon the
cone closes and the view of your universe condenses into a single point.
<p>
Now, I'd like to clear something up.  This whole business of hovering
around a black hole's photon sphere or near the event horizon is quite
speculative for one major reason: acceleration.  I rather blithely spoke
of hovering at the photon sphere --- if real humans were to try that,
they'd be squished by the acceleration of their rockets!  We're not
talking a couple G's of force --- for the smallest possible black hole for
a 100 kg person that force would be 2.9 x 10<sup>15</sup> Newtons!! (By
comparison, the force of gravity on a 100 kg person from the earth is
1,000 Newtons.) People just can't survive that kind of acceleration.  Most
things can't.  Still, it's rather useful to say such things in order to
get a good feel for what happens around black holes.
<p>
<i>That's</i> out of my system.  Onward to inside the event horizon!
<p>
<a name="cross"><h1>What happens when you cross the event horizon?</h1>
At first....well, nothing noticeable unless you consider the closure of
the light cone to be significant.  Had you been looking out the back
window, as previuosly mentioned, you would have seen the view of your
universe shrink to a dot and disappear; but there is no Star Trek force
field effect to tell you when you cross.  What you see and feel next all
depends on your reaction to the fact that you are now doomed to a painful
stretchy death.  You could <a href="braking.html">fire your rockets full
blast in the hopes of surviving a little longer by braking</a>, or you
could <a href="freefall.html">shut off the engines to make your last few
moments as comfortable as possible</a>.  It's a choose-your-own-adventure
black hole!
<a name="singularity"><h1>Beyond and to the Singularity!</h1>
I keep saying that, when you pass the event horizon, you keep
falling...but towards what?  Outside of the black hole, you always fell
towards the event horizon.  What's inside?  The answer is a little tricky.
You'd best check out the <a href="inside.html#singularity">Inside 'em</a>
section about singularities, if you want the exact answer.  Obviously, the
singularity is at the "center" of the black hole, according to my own
diagram at the top o' the page.  It's that little green dot.  Is there
really a little green dot at the center of a black hole?  No ... there's
no real center and there's no little green dot.  Okay, an interpretation
of gravity is the bending of spacetime.  Outside and close to the black
hole spacetime is bent a <i>lot</i>, but the curvature is still finite.
The closer you get to the singularity, the more spacetime is bent.  At the
singularity the curvature of spacetime is infinite, theoretically.
<p>
There's no center and there's nothing there except a lot of bent
spacetime.  This <i>sure</i> does make sense, Jillian.  Sorry, but the
singularity is a damn strange place (er, a strange time, that is).  What
happens near to it and what it is depends on quantum mechanics, which I
don't understand that well.  Accept this: the singularity of a static
black hole is described as a point at which spacetime is infinitly curved.
I cannot give you a satisfactory physical interpretation of that sentence.
