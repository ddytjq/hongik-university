              can be divided into three quite distinct periods. The first is his 
              boyhood days from 1643 up to his graduation in 1669. The second 
              period from 1669 to 1687 was the highly productive period in which 
              he was Lucasian professor at Cambridge. The third period (nearly 
              as long as the other two combined) saw Newton as a highly paid government 
              official in London with little further interest in mathematics.

            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isaac 
              Newton was born in the manor house of Wool<img src="newton01.jpg" width="125" height="158" align="right" alt="Isaac Newton">sthorpe, 
              near Grantham in Lincolnshire. Although he was born on Christmas 
              Day 1642, the date given on this card is the Gregorian calendar 
              date. (The Gregorian calendar was not adopted in England until 1752.) 
              Newton came from a family of farmers but never knew his father who 
              died before he was born. His mother remarried, moved to a nearby 
              village, and left him in the care of his grandmother. Upon the death 
              of his stepfather in 1656, Newton's mother removed him from grammar 
              school in Grantham where he had shown little promise in academic 
              work. His school reports described him as 'idle' and 'inattentive'. 
              An uncle decided that he should be prepared for the university, 
              and he entered his uncle's old College, Trinity College, Cambridge, 
              in June 1661. </font> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newton's 
              aim at Cambridge was a law degree. Instruction at Cambridge was 
              dominated by the philosophy of Aristotle but some freedom of study 
              was allowed in the third year of the course. Newton studied the 
              philosophy of Descartes, Gassendi, and Boyle. The new algebra and 
              analytical geometry of Vi&egrave;te, Descartes, and Wallis; and 
              the mechanics of the Copernican astronomy of Galileo attracted him. 
              Newton's talent began to emerge on the arrival of Barrow to the 
              Lucasian chair at Cambridge. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His 
              scientific genius emerged suddenly when the plague closed the University 
              in the summer of 1665 and he had to return to Lincolnshire. There, 
              in a period of less than two years, while Newton was still under 
              25 years old, he began revolutionary advances in mathematics, optics, 
              physics, and astronomy. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While 
              Newton remained at home he laid the foundation for differential 
              and integral calculus, several years b<img src="newton02.jpg" width="125" height="175" align="left" alt="Isaac Newton">efore 
              its independent discovery by Leibniz. The 'method of fluxions', 
              as he termed it, was based on his crucial insight that the integration 
              of a function is merely the inverse procedure to differentiating 
              it. Taking differentiation as the basic operation, Newton produced 
              simple analytical methods that unified many separate techniques 
              previously developed to solve apparently unrelated problems such 
              as finding areas, tangents, the lengths of curves and the maxima 
              and minima of functions. Newton's <i>De Methodis Serierum et Fluxionum</i> 
              was written in 1671 but Newton failed to get it published and it 
              did not appear in print until John Colson produced an English translation 
              in 1736. </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Barrow 
              resigned the Lucasian chair in 1669 recommending that Newton (still 
              only 27 years old) be appointed in his place. </font> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newton's 
              first work as Lucasian Professor was on optics. He had reached the 
              conclusion during the two plague years that white light is not a 
              simple entity. Every scientist since Aristotle had believed that 
              white light was a basic single entity, but the chromatic aberration 
              in a telescope lens convinced Newton otherwise. When he passed a 
              thin beam of sunlight through a glass prism Newton noted the spectrum 
              of colours that was formed. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newton 
              argued that white light is really a mixture of many different types 
              of rays which are refracted at slightly different angles, and that 
              each different type of ray produces a different spectral colour. 
              Newton was led by this reasoning to the erroneous conclusion that 
              telescopes using refracting lenses would always suffer chromatic 
              aberration. He therefore proposed and constructed a reflecting telescope. 
              </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newton 
              was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1672 after donating 
              a reflecting telescope. Also in 1672 Newton published his first 
              scientific paper on light and colour in the <i>Philosophical Transactions 
              of the Royal Society</i>. Newton's paper was well received but Hooke 
              and Huygens objected to Newton's attempt to prove, by experiment 
              alone, that light consists of the motion of small particles rather 
              than waves. Perhaps because of Newton's already high reputation 
              his corpuscular theory reigned until the wave theory was revived 
              in the 19th C. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newton's 
              relations with Hooke deteriorated and he turned in on himself and 
              away from the Royal Society. He delayed the publication of a full 
              account of his optical researches until after the death of Hooke 
              in 1703. Newton's <i>Opticks</i> appeared in 1704. It dealt with 
              the theory of light and colour and with (i) investigations of the 
              colours of thin sheets (ii) 'Newton's rings' and (iii) diffraction 
              of light. </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 
              explain some of his observations he had to use a wave theory of 
              light in conjunction to his corpuscular theory. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Newton's greatest 
              achievement was his work in physics and celestial mechanics, which 
              culminated in the theory of universal gravitation. By 1666 Newton 
              had early versions of his three laws of motion. He had also discovered 
              the law giving the centrifugal force on a body moving uniformly 
              in a circular path. However he did not have a correct understanding 
              of the mechanics of circular motion. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newton's 
              novel idea of 1666 was to imagine that the Earth's gravity influenced 
              the Moon, counter- balancing its centrifugal force. From his law 
              of centrifugal force and Kepler's third law of planetary motion, 
              Newton deduced the inverse- square law. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In 1679 Newton 
              corresponded with Hooke who had written to Newton claiming:- </font>
            <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>that 
              the Attraction always is in a duplicate proportion to the Distance 
              from the Center Reciprocall...</i> </font></blockquote>
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">M Nauenberg writes 
            an account of the next events:- </font> 
            <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>After 
              his </i>1679<i> correspondence with </i>Hooke<i>, Newton, by his 
              own account, found a proof that </i>Kepler<i>'s areal law was a 
              consequence of centripetal forces, and he also showed that if the 
              orbital curve is an ellipse under the action of central forces then 
              the radial dependence of the force is inverse square with the distance 
              from the centre.</i> </font></blockquote>
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This discovery 
            showed the physical significance of Kepler's second law. </font> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In 1684 Halley, 
              tired of Hooke's boasting:- </font>
            <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>asked 
              Newton what orbit a body followed under an inverse square force, 
              and Newton replied immediately that it would be an ellipse. However 
              in De Motu.. he only gave a proof of the converse theorem that if 
              the orbit is an ellipse the force is inverse square. The proof that 
              inverse square forces imply conic section orbits is sketched in 
              Cor. </i>1<i> to Prop. </i>13<i> in Book </i>1<i> of the second 
              and third editons of the Principia, but not in the first edition.</i>

            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Halley 
            persuaded Newton to write a full treatment of his new physics and 
            its application to astronomy. Over a year later (1687) Newton published 
            the <i>Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica</i> or <i>Principia</i> 
            as it is always known. </font> 
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
              <i>Principia</i> is recognised as the greatest scientific book ever 
              written. Newton analysed the motion of bodies in resisting and non 
              resisting media under the action of centripetal forces. The results 
              were applied to orbiting bodies, projectiles, pendulums, and free-fall 
              near the Earth. He further demonstrated that the planets were attracted 
              toward the Sun by a force varying as the inverse square of the distance 
              and generalised that all heavenly bodies mutually attract one another. 
              </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Further generalisation 
              led Newton to the law of universal gravitation: </font>
            <blockquote> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>all 
              matter attracts all other matter with a force proportional to the 
              product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square 
              of the distance between them.</i> </font></blockquote>
            <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newton 
            explained a wide range of previously unrelated phenomena:- the eccentric 
            orbits of comets; the tides and their variations; the precession of 
            the Earth's axis; and motion of the Moon as perturbed by the gravity 
            of the Sun. </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
            suffering a nervous breakdown in 1693, Newton retired from research 
            to take up a government position in London becoming Warden of the 
            Royal Mint (1696) and Master(1699). </font>
