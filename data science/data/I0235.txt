		come next june.</FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">Let me cast your minds back to a day when
		keegan trudged off the pitch at a rain soaked Wembley and announced he was off.
		If that evening when you were looking into the bottom of your glass someone
		came up to you and said you can go to the World Cup but you will be drawn into
		a group with Argentina, Sweden and Nigeria would you have taken that? Can you
		also remember the piles of calls to TalkSport after the Germany game (when we
		lost 1-0) at Wembley saying that we should now look to build the squad of youth
		for the 2006 World Cup? I'm sure you do. Can you remember the morning of the
		5-1 game against Germany, in Germany, thinking I would be happy with a draw?
		Can you remember the eighty eighth minute of the game against Greece and
		thinking about a trip to Ukraine? Can you remember half time in the World Cup
		game against Argentina just after they had scored and we were down to ten men?
		Did you think we would get to a penalty shoot out? </FONT></P> 
	 <P><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">Well, we have got a very hard group but do
		we not have to beat teams like Argentina to win the World Cup? Do you not also
		need a little luck on the way to win the World Cup? So, when you next hear some
		media pundit expert claiming this group is a bridge too far please remember
		this message. And should we get knocked out in the group stage (and I genuinely
		believe we won't) there will be the same media experts saying Sven now has to
		go. This is when you should e-mail the FA and tell Mr Crozier and Mr Ericsson
		that as England football fans you think they have done a fantastic job. We are
		the life blood of England football, not the media (they don't pay for their
		tickets). IN SVEN WE TRUST. </FONT></P>
