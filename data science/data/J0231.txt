<img src="../images/sitephotos/brockyates2.jpg" align="right" hspace="12" v:shapes="_x0000_s1026" width="130" height="200">I
expect, as the years move on,
this place will be unique as a research center for motorsports worldwide. It’s
a marvelous start. I’m truly honored to be here.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoBodyText3">I
was just thinking, I’m not one to dwell on anniversaries, but it was 50 years
ago that I first came to this place. My father brought me to the 1951 Grand
Prix. I sat on Old Corning Hill up there and watched the Cunninghams run. I was
intensely thrilled by that moment and Watkins Glen and has been sort of part of
my life ever since.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">My father was a writer. A very
good one. He wrote 80-odd books for Harper Brothers, Harper Collins now, and was
the managing editor for Popular Science magazine years ago. Even though I grew
up in a household where the profession was the sole source of income, I spent a
lot of time deciding I didn’t want to be a writer. In fact, I didn’t really
get serious about it until I was almost 30 years old. Which is now about 300
years ago.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">At that time, in the early
1950s, automotive journalism was really in its absolute infancy. Probably the
thing that I suppose electrified an awful lot of it – and I was talking to Dan
Gurney after he was here as grand marshal of the Zippo Vintage races. He and Evi
spent a week with Pamela and I; they were planning on spending a day, but, as
you’ll recall, we had a certain terrible interruption in our lives, on 9-11.
So Dan and Evi spent until the following Saturday. We sat around and laughed and
drank and talked about a lot of things dealing with automobiles and racing and
one thing or another.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">He noted that like myself, the
first book that triggered his imagination and elicited an enthusiasm for him,
and it’s happened with a lot of other guys our age, was “Motor Racing with
Mercedes Benz” by George Monkhouse, which was published in the late 1930s. It
was published in the United States by Floyd Clymer. Floyd Clymer was an
incredible publishing company. He was a motorcycle enthusiast for the most part,
an Indian dealer, but he started publishing automobile racing books on a small
scale in southern California, right after World War II. The Clymer publications
were an incredible core of interest for young men like myself and Gurney and a
whole lot of our generation.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Automobile journalism really in
a classic sense didn’t really exist. Motor and Auto Car were English magazines
that were published, but very rarely ever found in the United States. The first
magazine, which you’ll probably all know, the first automotive magazine of any
consequence, was Hot Rod. It was produced by Robert E. Petersen as a program for
the Los Angeles Hot Rod Exposition in 1946. It was sold on the steps of the Los
Angeles Exposition Center.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">“Hot rod” at that time was
considered pejorative. It was not a nice word. Hot rodders were not nice people.
Bob took the risk of calling his magazine Hot Rod, and, of course, it was the
core, the heart and soul, of the Petersen Publishing Company for almost 50
years. It was for many, many years the leading publication in the United States.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Shortly thereafter, Road &amp;
Track was started on the West Coast in 1948. It became the first sports car
magazine, road racing magazine, although, ironically, if you look back at an
early issue of Road &amp; Track magazine in anything up until about 1955, all
the advertising is hot rods. It was camshafts and Cole Muffler and all sorts of
speed equipment because the Southern California hot rod movement was the heart
and soul of the automobile in the United States, like it or not. The great
drivers came from hot rods, from Southern California. The sports car movement
really grew out of Southern California from the hot rod and the Petersen
Publishing Company.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A classic example: Petersen was
an enthusiast and imported a lot of cars from Europe. The Cisitalia was a
beautiful car, and in fact is one of the cars in the New York Museum of Modern
Art, a classic design. Bob Petersen imported one in late 1948 and Bill Burke and
Mickey Thompson, two hot rodders, borrowed it, knocked it off in Fiberglas, and
you will find that body still in collectors’ auctions around the United
States. Petersen’s Cisitalia, which he was furious about because when he got
it back it was all covered with kind of the remnants of this knock-off
Fiberglas.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">There was a great overlap of
that culture on the West Coast, between hot rods and sports car racing. Out of
that movement in California came the great car builders like Frank Kurtis and
the great fabricators Lujie Lesovsky and Emil Deidt and the people that built
the Scarabs. All those people were basically hot rodders, as were most of the
guys who built the Cunninghams. Ted Tappett, nee Phil Walters, Bill Frick, all
came from oval track racing and hot rods. So there was a great melding of two
cultures in the very early going.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Motor Track was the first
magazine to build against consumer automobiles. It was started in 1950, I
believe. Again, a Petersen publication. And then Sports Cars Illustrated was
started in 1954 and ultimately became Car and Driver magazine when Karl
Ludvigsen changed the name in 1961. I went to work for Car and Driver in 1964,
months after probably the most seminal automotive story which was ever written,
the one story that triggered more outrage, more memory, more craziness, more
insanity than any other story that I can remember in an automobile journalism.
That was David E. Davis’ comparison of the Ferrari GTO and a Pontiac GTO. An
incredible story. Hopelessly bogus and full of absolutely incredible hyperbole.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I went to work for the magazine
three months after that story had been published. In fact, I remember getting
the magazine at my home and I looked at it and I said, “Are these people nuts?
A Ferrari GTO being beaten up by this piece of Detroit iron?”</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The mission was much broader
than to merely express a kind of outrageous comparison. You had to tap the
interests of both sports car people and American car enthusiasts. Which Dave
Davis chose to do, to break it away from the simplistic loyalties that Hot Rod
had established on one side of the table and Road &amp; Track had established on
the other. We tried with Car and Driver to bring those divergent interests
together and to create a broad-spectrum automobile magazine, which was a pretty
interesting effort. I was along for the ride.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I was hired as managing editor
in 1964, and I’ve often reflected on the fact that I could neither manage nor
edit. It was a wild business in those days. Our great enemy and our great rival
was Road &amp; Track magazine. David was fired from Road &amp; Track for sloth
and disloyalty. Mostly with Car and Driver it was an act of revenge against Road
&amp; Track. As the established magazine it had some wonderful writers, Henry
Manney III and others. Bernard Cahier was the European correspondent. Car and
Driver was a hopeless kind of shirttail relative of automotive publications. Car
and Driver had a circulation of about 250,000; Road &amp; Track was something
like 400,000. It was absolutely a magazine of great power and influence.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">But, interestingly enough, it
had good writers, too. It had Grif Borgeson, who was a wonderful historian, who
has since passed away. Dean Batchelor who later became the editor. Dean
Batchelor was a classic example of this confluence of interests. Dean Batchelor
came from the hot rod world. He held many records on the Salt Flats, was a
terrific enthusiast, was a wonderful collector of cars and memorabilia and was
also a fine photographer. In those days, and even today, there were a number of
people who were attracted to automotive journalism. There was just the hard-core
car nut, the person who was crazy for cars and had some engineering background
or at least some backyard car mechanical skills and who went to work, for the
most part, for Petersen Publications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Those
were guys who were very, very hard-core guys. They were very knowledgeable about
automobiles and automotive mechanics. Some of them were limited in their writing
talents. That was the drive of Petersen, to make these hands-on, nuts-and-bolts
magazines.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Road &amp; Track was a little
bit more esoteric, was much more given toward kind of the gentlemanly, European
approach to the automobile. If you look back and you look at probably the
September 1955 issue, which covered the Le Mans crash of June of 1955, where 88
people were killed, they were barely mentioned. In those days, nobody ever got
killed, nobody ever got hurt. It was all kind of a vanilla treatment of motor
racing. It all was nice stuff, gentlemanly. Nobody got hurt. Nobody got killed.
Nobody had any arguments. We had a lovely day at the races.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Well, we took a harder edge at
Car and Driver. We tried to tell the way it was. We were the first magazine ever
to do comparison tests. If you read the magazines of those days, there’s
always some kind of a last paragraph that kind of waffles around. “Well, this
might not be the car for you. It may be a nice one for somebody else. We
certainly wouldn’t want to tell you not to buy it.” We did comparison tests
and lost all kinds of advertising. No one had ever said, “This car’s better
than that car.” It shook the industry. It rattled the industry. Nobody had
ever done this before because they were terrified that they were going to lose
advertising. And guess what? They did. The automobile industry, both the imports
and the domestics, were so spoiled. These magazines weren’t shills, but they
certainly were not about to make any sort of critical judgments about all of
this until the nutcases from Car and Driver came along and began to say this
one’s good and this one’s bad. It changed the dynamics of the industry
radically.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">There were some fascinating
people in the business at that time. The two giants of the early days of
American automotive journalism were Ken Purdy who was a brilliant writer, a fine
historian and a very interesting man unto himself, who wrote first for True
magazine and then really was a major, major force in automotive journalism at
Playboy. The Ken Purdy Award is still one of the most coveted awards in
automotive journalism. He was a wonderful, wonderful guy. A very interesting
individual.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The other one, almost the
antithesis of him in journalistic style, although they were very close friends
personally, was Tom McCahil who wrote for Mechanics Illustrated. McCahil was a
mad man. He was a great playboy. He came from a very wealthy family, was kind of
a black sheep. He went to work for this very obscure mechanical magazine – the
giant magazines in that field were Popular Mechanics and Popular Science.
Mechanics Illustrated was a third-rate operation until McCahil started to write
these incredibly hyperbolic road tests. If you go back and read Mechanics
Illustrated, I’m not sure if there’s any here at the Research Center, but
they’re great fun to read. He was a unique individual unto himself. He was
extremely influential to develop and to create an automotive enthusiasm. In the
early 1950s, when the sports car movement started to take hold, when the hot rod
movement was taking hold on the West Coast, there were no publications and then
there were guys like McCahil who suddenly said to America, “Hey, these cars
are fun. This is wild stuff out there. Enjoy it.”</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Roughly at the same time,
Competition Press was started by Denise McCluggage in Greenwich Village as a
weekly newspaper, a very tiny little operation. She and Steve Smith, who is my
neighbor in Wyoming now, started that thing. It was very brightly written.
Denise is a wonderfully witty and intelligent writer, who worked for the Herald
Tribune, and started this thing on a shirttail and of course it grew and grew
and grew and ultimately was purchased by John Bond at Road &amp; Track, when I
started to write for it and then was ultimately passed on to the Crain
Publications, which now is AutoWeek. That was a development of Competition Press
with Denise doing it. Of course Denise was a fine race driver and a major
influence in early automotive journalism.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We had some wonderful
photographers working around. Jesse Alexander is best remembered probably for
that, although there were terrific other photographers working in the field at
that time. In fact, Jesse’s got a major exhibition coming up in Santa Monica
coming up in the next week or so. A terrific guy and a masterful, masterful
photographer.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">There was some photojournalism
that went on. Jesse would write stories for Car and Driver. Bernard Cahier would
do race reports from Europe and take the photographs. But for the most part,
photojournalism has not really been a major part of American automobile
journalism. There have been a lot of writers, and there have been a lot of
photographers, but there been only one or two individuals that I recall who were
good enough to do it all.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">But there were some fascinating
men and women that were very influential. Wally Parks, who was the first editor
of Hot Rod magazine. Incredible. He started the National Hot Rod Association,
and is a giant, one of the most respected men in international motorsports. Bob
Petersen is still very vital and active. He started the Southern California
Timing Association, which raced out on the Salt Flats, and then started Hot Rod,
started the National Hot Rod Association. Incredibly influential in terms of
creating the Petersen Publishing Company, which was until very recently the
largest and now is part of Primedia. It was just purchased by Primedia, so
Automobile Magazine and Motor Trend magazine are now under the same hat. And my
old friend David E. Davis Jr. has now become the temporary editor-in-chief of
Motor Trend, which was kind of an odd turn of events for him because that puts
him in a unique position. Dave Davis and Steve Smith are the only guys that I
know that worked for all three of them – Motor Trend, Road &amp; Track and Car
and Driver. I wrote a few stories for Motor Trend, but not enough to include
myself in their camp, and it doesn’t really bother me a whole lot.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Then there are some wonderful
racing drivers that have done terrific automotive journalism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Probably the greatest of all was Paul Frere, the French journalist who
won Le Mans. That’s pretty good. Jerry Titus who was editor of Sports Car
Graphic magazine, a Petersen Publication, was a very good race driver. He was
killed at Elkhart Lake in a Trans-Am race in 1972, ’71. Pat Bedard ran at
Indianapolis twice, crashed twice. Peter Brock, who’s now a very prominent
photojournalist, was the original designer of the Shelby Daytona coupe and was a
protégé of Bill Mitchell’s and when he was 19 years old he was working on
the design team of the first Corvettes. Absolutely unbelievable career. But in
his later years, we laugh, he’s turned to becoming a journalist, which is not
good, not good.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">One of the Vanderbilts, one of
the third or fourth generation, was at a party with J.P. Morgan, and Morgan
asked him what he was going to be when he grew up and he said, “Well, sir, I
plan to be a journalist.” And Morgan said, “Well, all of two things can
happen to a journalist. You’ll either become a drunken wastrel or you will
remain a journalist. And I’m not sure which is worse.”</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In the early part of this
business, it was all magazines. There was some newspaper coverage. New York
Times had a man by the name of Frank Blunk The Los Angeles Times had a fine,
fine motorsports writer by the name of Shav Glick a major, major player from the
West Coast at the time. Other good writers were working at some newspapers. But
newspapers for the most part ignored motorsports really until the early 1970s
when the Southern newspapers began to heavily cover NASCAR. For the most part,
major dailies did not treat automobile racing with any seriousness and therefore
there weren’t many journalists working on newspapers on an auto racing beat.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">But then of course, television
began to come into play, first with organizations like Triangle Films in
Philadelphia, mainly because the owner was enthusiastic for motorsports. He had
a deal with Johnson’s Wax to record the Can-Am series and some very good film
was done. I worked for them on occasion. But it was all shot on 16-millimeter
and very slow editing process. There was some television, but not much. The
first Indianapolis 500 that was televised, I believe, was pay-per-view
television in I think 1963 or ’64. Very little television was even being
considered as part of a major league effort in automobile racing coverage until
really it gained tremendous acceleration in the middle 1970s.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">So now we have the massive
explosion in automotive journalism. Radio shows. Television shows. Cable
television, Speedvision, now, soon to become the Speed Channel. In February
there will be 24 hours devoted to our sport. We’ve got hundreds of magazines,
literally. Go into a newsstand and you’ll fine 60 or 70 titles devoted to
automobiles and not only to automobile journalism but to automotive products of
all kinds. We’ve got Internet sites. Now we’ve got more coverage and more
opportunity, by the way, for journalists than ever before.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">When I think back on the days
when I started scribbling there were just probably a dozen outlets, magazines
and a few newspapers worldwide, and now we are inundated with the ability to
cover our sport. And we are now blessed with this wonderful facility where much
of that material is going to become part of the repository for all time. To me,
it makes this room so special. I know everybody that has scribbled in the trade
will hope one day to be represented in this room.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I’d be delighted to field some
questions and answer what I can.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Q: Do you want to tell the
people how you got involved with your little hot rod race car, The Eliminator.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A: I’ve owned race cars on and
off, and I discovered a car that was rather significant in Southern California
sports car racing, built by a man by the name of Duffy Livingston, who built the
third go-kart. The first go-kart ever was built by Art Ingles, a Kurtis Kraft
employee in Glendale, Calif., in 1956. Ingles was a wonderful craftsman. Then
another guy built the second one, and Duffy built the third one. They used to
race them around Hollywood Bowl parking lot. Then it exploded from there, and
Duffy went on to start the Go-Kart Company. That’s why if you’ve ever seen
that Eliminator hot rod run at Watkins Glen it has a Go-Kart logo on the hood,
because that’s his company. Go-karting has now become worldwide. The first one
driven by a man by the name of Ingles, by Kurtis Kraft shops, and that’s how I
got a hold of the car.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Q: (Refers to reacting to the
Pontiac GTO/Ferrari GTO comparison story)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A: Everybody did, everybody went
crazy. We were getting letters from that story a year afterwards.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Q: Did Car &amp; Driver know
about the Pontiac?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A: Oh yeah. The Pontiacs that
were produced for road tests at that time were done by a Pontiac dealership
called Royal Pontiac in Royal Oak, Michigan, which was a closet outlet for the
Pontiac Motor Division. It was a race shop. The cars were basically raced on
Woodward Avenue. Woodward Avenue was a great street racing scene in the 1960s
and ’70s, still is a little bit, but street racing was big-time stuff. The
factories put cars out there to race. Royal Pontiac put street-racing cars out
to compete. Chrysler had Hemis out there. Dodge and Plymouth had theirs.
They’d go out Saturday night and they’d race each other up and down Woodward
Avenue. It’s hard to believe, but that was true. The guy behind the Pontiac
GTO campaign was Jim Wangers, who was an advertising guy. He was a client
representative kind of guy. He was very close friends with John DeLorean, who
was then the general manager of Pontiac. DeLorean was the driving force behind
the GTO. The GTOs that we would get and other magazines would get were “Royal
Pontiacs,” which were really steamy cars. They were a lot faster than normal
GTOs, but the car that was tested by Car &amp; Driver in that infamous test was
a Royal Pontiac. They’d tried to get a hold of a GTO Ferrari and they
couldn’t. The test was done on back straightaway at Daytona International
Speedway. It was an incredible story, but made no sense.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Q: What’s your take on Formula
1 at Indy?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A: I’d like to see all that
Mickey Mouse stuff taken out of the infield. Give them a couple of fast sweepers
and put them on the back straight and let them run down the back straightaway
and down the front straightaway and see how great they really are.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Q: Would you talk a little bit
about the first Cannonball Run?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A: Ah the Cannonball. The
Cannonball was first run in 1971. You’ve got to remember that in 1971, Ralph
Nader was in full cry. The government was really moving in on the automobile in
terms of the Clean Air Act. Safety legislation was becoming a major, major cause
celebre in the automobile field. So I decided that we would have a race across
the country, from New York to Los Angeles. The reason for that was there’s
kind of a symbolism about the great drive West. From East to West was sort of
the great theme in those days. So we set up an event with one rule: There are no
rules. We started at the Red Ball Garage, which was on 32nd Street. It was a
public garage where we kept our automobiles when we tested them. The destination
was the Portofino Inn on the ocean in Redondo Beach, California, which at that
time was owned by Mary Davis who was an early Cal Club race driver herself. It
was a hangout for racers. Peter Revson had a condo there. A lot of the guys who
raced at Ascot hung out at the Portofino. So it was a racer’s hangout and a
beautiful little hotel.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The object of the event was you
got time card and there was time clock on the counter at the Red Ball Garage.
You got your time slip there, and there was a clock on the desk of the Portofino
Inn. Lowest was the fast time coast-to-coast. It was very simple. The first one
was done in February of 1971. It’s an interesting story, and I won’t bore
you with it. At that time, legend had it that Wilt Chamberlain had driven across
the country in 36 hours all by himself. It had never been proven that he did it.
He claimed he did it, but he was unclear about what had happened and why he did
it. That was kind of urban legend. So, nobody had ever really done any
cross-country running except for a man by the name of Ernest G. “Cannonball”
Baker. Baker was a real character. He was a very interesting guy. He was the
first commissioner of NASCAR, but he’d run at Indianapolis; he was a great
motorcycle racer and in the 1920s he did a lot of running for various companies
as a test driver. He would take a car and he’d run from point to point,
establishing some kind of a record. In 1933, he ran an Auburn speedster coast to
coast in 56½ hours. Alone. To me that was a staggering effort. He took a
half-hour’s sleep somewhere in Kansas. The roads were never really much. West
of Phoenix there were no roads. Corduroy roads, dirt roads.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I thought this was an awesome,
awesome piece of work. We decided that we’d do it and the first one we did, we
did alone. Robert Redford actually talked about doing it. He was really
fascinated with the idea, but never went. He dropped out, and some other guy
couldn’t go and dropped, and I finally ended up driving it alone with my son,
who was 14 years old and couldn’t drive and just went along for the ride.
Also, Jim Williams who now lives in Western New York and works for an ad agency
in Rochester, who was then a young art director with the magazine, and Steve
Smith, who I had worked with at Car and Driver and was one of the co-founders of
Competition Press, a terrific writer. So the three of us launched and drove
across the country and got lost in Twenty-Nine Palms, California. It was a
terrible drive. It took us 41½ hours coast to coast. We came home and I wrote a
column about it in the magazine. We got a challenge very shortly thereafter from
Polish Racing Drivers of America. You probably know Oscar Koveleski. Polish
Racing Drivers of America said, “We challenge you to the next Cannonball.” I
had called the event the Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining Sea Memorial Dash in
Baker’s name. “We challenge you to a race. We will beat you, if we can find
California.” They showed up with a van that somebody had built for them with
four 55-gallon drums of fuel. The drivers were Oscar, Brad Niemcek, who was a
public relations guy in New York City, and Tony Adamowicz, who has raced here
many, many times. I remember Smith saw that thing and he said, “If that thing
goes up, it’s going to make Hiroshima look like a white flash.” It was
unbelievable. They ran out of gas in Albuquerque, 800 miles short. Gurney and I
ran a Ferrari. It was a very difficult drive. We were in about eight hours of
horrible snow in the Rocky Mountains, though we managed to get across the
country in just under 36 hours, which established a coast-to-coast record that
stood for a long time. We had a great deal of fun with it. Gurney and I still
call each other teammates because of that idiotic drive. It was a great car.
That car is now in the Bruce McCaw collection in Washington. It’s very well
preserved. My Challenger that I drove later in other Cannonballs and some other
cars are going to be featured at the Amelia Island Concours d’Elegance. The
Ferrari will be there, and some other cars. There’s been the Cannonball Run
movie. Siskel and Ebert listed it as one of the 10 worst movies. And, believe it
or not, another one of those things is the works. Cannonball 3.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It was a great period. The last
Run that we did was in 1979. David Heinz, the late David Heinz who raced here at
Watkins Glen a great many times, and a car dealer from Savannah, Georgia, drove
an XJ6 across the country in just under 33 hours. That was the final record. The
last record. The ambulance that was in the movie Cannonball Run was the actual
ambulance run by my wife, Pamela, and I and a doctor, who shall remain nameless
or he probably would be kicked out of his profession if they knew what we did
with that car. I’m doing a book right now for Motor Books International which
is a history of the Cannonball. It will involve the stories, not just my
stories. Peter Brock who, of course, drove disguised as a priest, and Donna Mae
Mims who with Judy Stropus had the only accident, rolled a Cadillac limousine
outside El Paso, Texas. Broke Donna Mae’s arm. There are all sorts of
wonderful stories and we’ve got lots of people like Oscar Koveleski and George
Willig, the guy that climbed the World Trade Center, the much-lamented World
Trade Center. We had a mad collection of people who ran. I’m doing it for
Motor Books International and at first I decided I didn’t want to do it. I had
some other projects to work on that were more important to me, and my wife,
Pamela, said, “Do it for your grandchildren.” It’s going to be a good
story. We’ve got lots of photographs and lots of funny stories from all the
people who were in it.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Q: Speaking of another
Cannonball, you had your own newsletter for a while. What was your motivation
for starting that? What were your experiences?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A: It probably was a mistake
because it got me fired at Car &amp; Driver. Dave Davis took umbrage at that and
so he canned me. I just wanted to do something that was kind of my own and
amusing. Car &amp; Driver at that time was not doing any motorsports coverage,
and still doesn’t. I just wanted to kind of have a voice of my own and I had a
great deal of fun doing it. Unfortunately my business and my life was so active
that it was hard for me to do it all by myself. I hired a fellow by the name of
Chuck Dressing who’s still writing for Racer magazine. Chuck Dressing is a
very, very talented writer. He’s a very, very good student of the sport and
was a major help to me. Chuck got other employment for more money and moved away
and then I just couldn’t do it any more. I just didn’t have enough time to
do it by myself. But it was great fun.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Q: Are you still working on the
street rod?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A: Yes, we’ve been working on
a street rod that we’ll have finished here probably in time for Amelia Island,
where it’s going to be shown. It’s kind of a 1950s sports car-slash-hot rod.
A Viper car. A six-feet Viper. Gearbox in it. It’s going to be a pretty neat
little car.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Q: What is your take on Robert
Lutz joining General Motors? Do you think he’ll be able to turn that company
around?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A: Bob Lutz is a brilliant,
brilliant car guy. Very, very devoted to the automobile as a product. He will
have an influence there, there’s no doubt about it. It’s not easy. General
Motors is an enormous bureaucracy, much, much larger by a scale of three than
Chrysler was. It’s going to be a lot harder for him because there are layers
of management that are entrenched. It’s like trying to turn the government
around. It’s going to be difficult for him. But there’s very, very
interesting things coming along. There’s an aluminum V-12 engine that General
Motors will be producing in the very near future. Four-valve twin cam, that’s
already in the works. We’ve seen those engines. There’s going to be very
interesting engines. They’re going to be doing those things and they’re
going to be building very interesting automobiles. The new CTS rear-drive
Cadillac is a very good car. We’ve talked to them and driven them recently and
it’s pretty impressive. I think Lutz will make it even better. The major
challenge that Lutz faces is Chevrolet. We all remember when the Bel Aire and
the Impala were sort of the standard of American highways, in terms of
entry-level automobiles and now that brand has become in my opinion, and the
opinion of a lot of the guys in the industry, blurred. It’s lost that kind of
panache and power at the bottom, entry level in this marketplace. He’s got
some big challenges ahead of him. But if anybody can do it, he can. I’d say,
just off the cuff, that if I was Ron Zarella I’d probably be polishing up my
resume because I don’t think there’s room for those two at the top.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Q: What’s your take on CART?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A: You heard it here first. CART
will go out of business by the end of 2002. It’s over. Most everybody in the
business is convinced that it’s over. It’s chaos. They’ve lost the handle.
I predicted they’d go out of business when IRL started. Everybody said I was
nuts. I’ve been late. They’re in terrible trouble.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Q: Do you think that this could
really spell the end of American open-wheel road racing?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A: It’s an interesting
question. CART could disintegrate as quickly as a lot of people in the industry
think it’s going to, or at least become a shadow of itself, weaker, or it
could go overseas, where they’re going to have a lot more trouble because
they’re facing Mr. Ecclestone. We don’t know what’s going to happen, but
it’s going to cause an enormous rift and a hole in the schedules of places
like Long Beach and Road America and Laguna Seca, Mid-Ohio, Toronto. Big-market
events where these tracks depend on a CART race for their major showcase of the
season. What’s going to happen, who’s going to fill that hole? Is Dr. Panoz
going to fill it? Is the Rolex? Will the Frances’ Great-American series do
that? Will another open-wheel series rise up out of the ashes of CART? I don’t
think anybody knows. It appears that Tony George is not interested in developing
any more road races, but we don’t know about that. It’s going to be a
sea-change in the way American open-wheel racing is done. No question about
that. Now, I could be wrong. Grosfeld and Jerry Forsythe could turn it around,
but everybody believes, everybody in the business at the top level, believes
that the only way CART can be saved is it has to be taken out of Wall Street
because they are serving two masters. They cannot operate as a publicly operated
company where they got to keep the stock prices supported and run a successful
motor sports operation. Probably the only guy that can do it is Forsythe. It’s
not good at this point. It’s a grim situation.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">They basically made a major,
major tactical error, in my opinion. They cut the umbilical between American
oval track racing at its core level – that is DIRT, Sprint cars, Midgets –
that was the farm system that American open-wheel racing created, whether we
like it or not. We love road racing, but the core appetite for motorsports in
America is of two forms: Drag racing and oval-track racing, like it or not. We
road-racing nuts have an acquired taste, kind of like single-malt scotch. But
the beer-drinking, pick-up truck driving guy in the United States is an oval
track enthusiast. Anybody that attempts to make a massive breakthrough in this
industry by ignoring that formula of sports makes a mistake, especially at that
level.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">They basically veered off. Most
of the guys that formed CART – Gnassi, Penske, Hobbs and others – were
road-racing enthusiasts. They came from sports car backgrounds. So it was
obvious that they would concentrate on creating a major open-wheel series in
road racing. The problem is there is one 1,000-pound gorilla standing in the
way, called the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. There’s no way around it in the
United States. What the Frances did, of course, brilliantly, was to create a
farm system so that every kid that showed up on the grid at Charlotte Motor
Speedway dragged with him thousands of enthusiasts. They came out of little
places like Dundee and hundreds of little bullrings around the United States. So
there was a farm system that was created by NASCAR, and for the most part the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway through USAC, even though it was a thoroughly
mismanaged operation. Triple-A before that had a core movement toward
Indianapolis and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway radiated outward to other races
on the championship trail. Once that umbilical cord was cut, we began to bring
in brilliant race drivers from overseas, wonderful drivers. But, as I’ve said
in print, they were strangers in a strange land. It was like the Bolshoi Ballet
playing at the Atlanta Holiday Inn. What happened, ultimately, that was what
would spell doom for them. I don’t care how brilliant Helio Castroneves is,
you’re not going to put bodies in the grandstands in God’s own United States
with him. It just won’t work, and that’s what happened. Television ratings
were terrible. Somebody is going to have to identify the fact that if American
open-wheel motor racing is going to exist, it’s going to have to deal with
Americans. NASCAR proves that over and over again. The NASCAR model is magic. It
just works because its farm system is so logical. And now we’re losing
open-wheel drivers. Penske is going to send Ryan Newman, a brilliant young
driver. You’re going to hear a lot about Ryan Newman in years to come. He’s
going to NASCAR. Kasey Kahne who’s a brilliant, brilliant USAC driver.
You’re going to hear a lot more of. He’s going to go to NASCAR. Give them
their due, they’re brilliant. But it’s sucking the wind out of American
oval-track racing. And the IRL is nothing to write home about either, except
they have the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. I talked to Humpy Wheeler about this
a year ago and he said that a great percentage of the crowds that show up,
especially at the more northernmost Winston Cup races – and that includes
here, Charlotte Motor Speedway, Richmond, Darlington, Atlanta – are
disaffected oval-track enthusiasts. They’ve given up on their kind of sport,
that they grew up with in Pennsylvania and in Indiana and in New York State,
where these bullrings were the core of their enthusiasm and they’ve given up
and gone south. It’s a bigger marketing problem than anybody recognizes. And
money won’t secure it.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Q: Do you know the whereabouts
of the Fangio Chevrolet?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A: The Fangio car? It’s at his
home. Fascinating car. Fascinating driver.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Q: Do you see any entry-level,
rear-wheel-drive cars coming on? Like Corvette, Monte Carlo? These cars are
disappearing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A: We’re going to see the
entry-level cars – if you ever saw the movie “Fast and Furious” –
that’s where it’s at. The little guys, the little Japanese cars that these
kids are producing incredible horsepower numbers from. It’s hard to imagine. I
don’t ever watch them or see them, but there are guys driving Hondas around in
Southern California that are 10-second cars in the quarter-mile. It’s
unbelievable. These little rocket ships. And that’s where the major trend with
kids is. I don’t see any rear-drive, entry-level cars in the marketplace. Of
course, every time General Motors got one that seems to work, they cancel it.
They’d get it about right to get rid of it. I think we’re going to see some
performance cars coming out of Saturn and elsewhere that are going to try to
compete on the domestic level. Neon and others. But we’ve got to answer that
challenge, because Hondas and little Toyotas are really very, very popular with
the young kids.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Q: Talking about open-wheel, how
about your take on Formula 1 and a possible historic series.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A: Formula 3000 is their
start-up series and it’s a very good one in Europe. Of course, it doesn’t
come here.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Q: What I meant was Ferrari,
Williams and such are looking at having a second series.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A: Split the season up? I
don’t know. I don’t know enough about it. You’ll have to ask Bernie, he
owns the whole deal. Formula 1 has escalated to a level that is way, way beyond
anything else in terms of worldwide motorsports. If any of you have been to
Indianapolis, or to any recent Formula 1 race, you’ll recognize that it’s
almost unrecognizable compared to any other forms of motorsport. It’s hard to
say what they’re going to do with it. I’m sure that there’s going to be
some worldwide impact. The Far Eastern races. We’re on the verge of some
international turmoil here, and I don’t think anybody knows which way that’s
going to go. It would be interesting to hear what their long-range strategies
are based on the new world situation. I’ve heard nothing about a second
series. I’ve heard talk about that for NASCAR, but it doesn’t seem to gain
traction.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Q: Would the 3000 work here in
the United States as a replacement for CART?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A: There seems to be no question
that they’re going to go to the same IRL formula, although for some idiotic
reason they decided they don’t want to have a rev-limiter which will only add
expense and cost and make designers and the car owners spend more money to get a
couple extra rpms and keep people in the grandstand, who, by the way, don’t
care about it. I don’t know if the 3000 series would work. It certainly
isn’t rocket science to build a 3½-liter road-racing car. It’s in turmoil
now. I don’t think anyone really knows how it’s going to shake out. I could
be totally wrong. CART could rise up tomorrow and be the greatest racing series
in North America. I don’t see that.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Q: Speedvision and other ones
show a lot of Formula 2000 and the Toyota Atlantic series.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A: The Toyota Atlantic series is
a good series, a very, very good series and a lot of very good young drivers are
coming out of there. That needs support probably more than anything. That’s a
very good series. It’s interesting though. Where are the car drivers coming
from? Where did Jeff Gordon come from? Tony Stewart? You know where they come
from? Midgets. You know where they’re coming from? Non-wing Midgets and
non-wing Sprint cars. If I was going to put a kid in a car right now, I’d
stick him in a USAC Midget. The demand of car control at that level and at that
kind of competition is a very, very interesting starter place. The competition
is so intense and so difficult and relentless, that good guys will rise to the
surface. It’s interesting that the guys that have run World of Outlaws in
Sprint cars are not successful in NASCAR.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Q: Pro-rallying is something
which Americans don’t know about, even though it’s been over here for a
long, long time. It’s real popular over in Europe. Down in Pennsylvania, down
in Wellsboro, they’ve got at nice rally. Do you think it will ever gain
acceptance over here?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A: Cricket’s popular in
England, too. No, I’m sorry! It’s a wonderful sport. It’s a great
participation sport. It’s tremendous competition. A great bunch of people. But
the fact that you can’t put spectators anywhere near it is a problem.
They’ve tried rally-cross and things like that. It’s an acquired taste again
in Europe, and it has been very important in Europe for years. It just doesn’t
seem to gain traction here. I’m not quite sure why. It’s too bad that the
guys in SCORE, the off-road racing guys on the West Coast, can’t hook up sort
of a universal formula with the East Coast rally guys, because it’s basically
the same philosophy: Drive like lunatics on dirt roads. But the twain shall
never meet. It would be nice if they could because they’re the same bunch of
people, with just different cars.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Q: Why does it seem that over
the last several years there are more major injuries and deaths in motorsports?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A: It’s a dangerous sport.
It’s always been a dangerous sport. I’ve said in print, whether we like it
or not, it is a sport that separates it from other sports. Ernest Hemingway said
there are really only three sports: motor racing, mountain climbing and bull
fighting. He said the rest of them are games. Unfortunately we don’t like it
to happen. But, on the other hand, and it’s hard to say this, but it lends a
certain kind of majesty, this danger, this element of danger and paying the
ultimate price, is what makes motor racing special. And, if you turn it into a
bunch of bumper cars, where everyone can go like blazes and never be hurt, some
of that element of the pinnacle of this sport will disappear. We hate to see it
happen and fortunately it isn’t happening as much as it used to. If you look
down at eight of the Indianapolis starting fields from 1915 to 1965 you will
find out of 33 drivers, 50 percent died. Another half of that field received
debilitating injuries. For example, in the 1955 Indianapolis 500, eight of the
top 10 finishers died in race cars. That’s unbelievable. The mortality rate is
much, much lower than it was. We’re shocked by it. It’s terrible, but thank
God, it’s radically better than it was.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Of Formula 1 Grand Prix drivers,
half of them were either terribly injured or died in a racing car. Burned up. We
finally got the cars good enough and so that we finally got them to wear helmets
and roll bars in the 1950s and seat belts so they weren’t pitched out on their
heads, and then we got fire. We went through fire all through the ’60s.
Finally we got fuel cells. Now we’ve got crushable body structures and halcyon
systems and other things. It is safer. It is definitely safer. The speeds are
up.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Q: What do you see, other than
say go-karts that have to go to Europe, as the minor league of open wheel racing
in this country? It seems to me there is no real support or not as much support
for those types of racing here.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A: The problem is here, say, a
young man wants to run as an amateur race driver. He wants to start out. He
wants to drive a race car. He wants to obtain a road-racing career. He’s got
to join the SCCA, and if he’s lucky, if he’s lucky, and he’s able to have
enough money to do pretty much what he wants to, he might get a chance to race
30 times a year. Now in Europe, he can race 10 times a month. I think the
question of our kids not being successful in road racing is the fact that they
don’t get enough seat time. There just isn’t enough motor racing. Look,
what’s the Formula Atlantic schedule? Sixteen races or 18, there’re not very
many. So a kid who wants to start out in the United States flat doesn’t get
very much racing. Alex Gurney, Dan’s son, is racing in that British Formula 3
series. He raced twice a weekend and they’re in those cars literally every day
of the week. Not here in the United States, and I think that’s primarily a
question of just simple experience, just honing your skills. We don’t have
that much here. We’re such a large country. We race here, and maybe next
weekend you’ve got to go to Indianapolis Raceway Park and then you’ve got to
go to Heartland Park. To chase the SCCA national schedule in the United States
requires a lot of money and a lot of travel. So it’s hard. I think that’s
one of the reasons. I think that’s one of the reasons why we don’t have
that, and we should have. We’ve got 280 million people here and the biggest
core of enthusiasm for this sport anywhere worldwide and we’re still not very
well represented in CART or at Indianapolis or in the IRL.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Q: Do you have plans to keep up
the One Lap of America?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A: Oh yes. The One Lap of
America is going to start in Rochester in the High Falls District next year.
High Falls Brewing is very much involved. The City of Rochester is very much
involved with it. It’s going to start the third of May downtown. We’re going
to have a big crowd down there Friday night. We’re going to have fun. We’re
going to go to Indianapolis Raceway Park, run the drag strip and the course. And
then we’re going to run a dirt track in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Then we’re going to
do the Continental Divide Raceway in Boulder, Colorado. Then a new little
racetrack in Sandia, New Mexico, outside Albuquerque, and then Texas World
Speedway. We’re going to do Road Atlanta and then Summit Point and then back
to Rochester. It will be fun. Going to do some serious car racing, too.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Q: (Question about<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>the Trans-Am series)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A: I raced in Trans-Am in ’71.
It was one of the great series of all times. Without reflecting negatively on my
friends at the SCCA, no other club’s managed to botch up the three greatest
racing series there’s ever been in the United States: the Can-Am, the Formula
5000 and the Trans-Am. The Trans-Am is a hollow representation of what it used
to be. The original Trans-Am cars were basically production-based cars.
Five-liters. They were silhouette cars. Now you’ve got other idiotic
representational cars. Paul Gentilozzi driving a Jaguar around? That thing is no
more a Jaguar and less than that little TC out there. I don’t know what
they’re doing. The Trans-Am is a great series, but it’s got to go back to
some semblance of production-based automobiles or else it’s meaningless. That
was the great charm of Trans-Am. And, of course, when the Trans-Am was in its
prime, it had some the greatest race drivers in the world: Mark Donohue,
Parnelli Jones, George Follmer. Good God, what a war that was! That was glorious
motor racing. I wish Trans-Am would come back, but they’ve got to do some
major, major re-examination of what they’re doing. Jupiter chassis stock cars
are interesting, but they don’t belong on the course.</p>

</o:p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Q: (Question about the Trans-Am
series and high-performance cars)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A: We don’t have any more
muscle cars, do we? They’re all gone. It’s going to be hard to do. We’ve
lost all of the Challengers and the Barracudas and the 302s and the GTOs. All
that stuff is gone. The rear-drive, high-performance American automobile is a
thing of the past. I don’t know how we’re going to get it back. I know the
guys at the SCCA do a good job are trying to get that thing right. But it should
be a series that should stand on its own. It’s kind of right now sort of a
lounge act. It’s a support series. It’s not right. It should be a big deal.
It was a great series, and I’d love to see it come back.</p>
