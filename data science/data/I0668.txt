<p>
<p> No fewer than five teams have won the European Cup Winners' Cup in spite of 
  not being domestic cup holders at the time. 
<p>



<strong>Fiorentina</strong> won the inaugural edition of the "Cup Winners' Cup" in

<strong>1960/61</strong> in spite of having lost the Italian Cup Final in 1960 to

double winners Juventus.

<p>



<strong>Rangers</strong> were the second team to achieve this, winning the <strong>1971/72</strong> edition

after having lost the 1970/71 Scottish Cup Final to champions Celtic after

a replay.  In the second round of their Cup Winners' Cup campaign, they lost  

a penalty shoot-out 0-3 at Sporting CP in Lisbon; however, this was staged 

erroneously by the referee who had failed to take the goal Rangers had scored 

in extra time into account for the away goals rule (both teams had won 3-2 at 

home, and extra time in Lisbon had finished 4-3).

<p> Likewise, <strong>Anderlecht</strong> won the <strong>1977/78</strong> edition 
  of the "Cup Winners' Cup" for which they qualified by virtue of losing the Belgian 
  Cup Final in 1977 to champions FC Brugge. That was, by the way, the third time 
  in succession that Anderlecht made the final of the CWC: they also won it in 
  1976, and in 1977 they fell to the CWC Jinx. 
<p>



Then, <strong>Dynamo Tbilisi</strong> won the <strong>1980/81</strong> edition although they had lost

the Soviet Union Cup Final of 1979/80 to Shakhter Donetsk.  The reason

here: the final was played after the deadline UEFA had set for registration;

since both clubs were eligible for the UEFA Cup (based on the final table

of the 1979 season, in which Shakhter had come 2nd and Dynamo Tbilisi 4th),

they were simply "distributed" over the two cups before the final had been

played; in the end, the final result (Shakhter 2-1 Dynamo) belied that

distribution.

<p>



Finally, <strong>Barcelona</strong> won the <strong>1996/97</strong> edition after losing the 1996

Copa del Rey against Atl&eacute;tico de Madrid, who took the Spanish double that

season.

<p> Anderlecht and Barcelona then also won the Supercup in 1978 and 1997, respectively.
