<h1>Messier 102</h1>

An article on the controversy by 
<a href="http://www.seds.org/~spider/">Hartmut Frommert</a>
</center>

<pre>
      102. Nebula between the stars Omicron Bootis and Iota Draconis:
           it is very faint, near it is a star of 6th magnitude

                          Messier in Connaissance des Temps for 1784, p. 267
</pre>
<a href="../xtra/history/biograph.html">Charles Messier</a> compiled his 
"<a href="../xtra/history/m-cat.html">Catalogue of Nebulae and Star Clusters</a>" 
during the years 1758 to 1781 (or 1782 if one counts the last additions by his
colleague <a href="../xtra/history/pmechain.html">Pierre M&eacute;chain</a>, 
which are contained in most modern versions of the catalog).  Contrary to prior 
and contemporary observers who had a large number of errors (nonexistent 
objects) in their lists, the entries of his catalog correspond to actual 
astronomical objects in all cases, perhaps with one exception, his 
<a href="../xtra/history/m-cat.html#M102">entry number 102</a> 
(there are positional errors for 3 other objects, <a href="m047.html">M47</a>, 
<a href="m048.html">M48</a>, and <a href="m091.html">M91</a>, which could be 
<a href="../missing.html">figured out by the time</a>).
<p>
For this object (<a href="m102.html">M102</a>), Messier gives above 
description together with <a href="m101.html">M101</a> and 
<a href="m103.html">M103</a> as communicated to him 
"through M. M&eacute;chain, which M. Messier has not yet observed."
He gives no position for M102 (and M103) in the published
version of the catalog (although he has added positions from hand in his 
personal copy, see below).
<p>
About two years after the entry was made and published, Pierre M&eacute;chain 
retracted his discovery and claimed that the observation was an error, a 
duplicate observation of M101, and a star chart error of Messier.  In a 
<a href="../xtra/history/pm-lett.html">letter to Bernoulli</a>, dated May 6, 
1783, he <a href="../xtra/history/pm-lett.html#m102">wrote</a>:
<blockquote>
  On page 267 of the "<b>Connaissance des Temps</b> for 1784", M. Messier lists
  under No. 102 a nebula which I have discovered between Omicron Bootis and
  Iota Draconis: this is a mistake.  This nebula is the same as the preceding
  No. 101.  In the list of my nebulous stars communicated to him, M. Messier
  has confused this one because of an error in the sky chart.
</blockquote>
This reference got longly forgotten and was only recovered by Helen Sawyer
in 1947/48; based on this letter she also <a href="../addition.html">added</a> 
the objects <a href="m105.html">M105</a> to <a href="m107.html">M107</a> to the
modern Messier Catalog [<a href="#sawyer">Sawyer 1948</a>].
Kenneth Glyn Jones [<a href="#kgj">Glyn Jones 1991</a>], and even more definite, 
Owen Gingerich in his contribution to Sky & Telescope 
[<a href="#ginger">Gingerich 1960</a>] (reprinted in Mallas/Kreimer's Messier
Album [<a href="#mallas">Mallas &amp; Kreimer 1978</a>]) regard this issue as 
solved, in the sense that M102 is a duplication of M101.  
One could easily join this conclusion, as the discoverer himself admitted a 
fault and retracted.
<p>
However, there remain some doubts and arguments which still allow for
other possibilities, as also Kenneth Glyn Jones admits.  First of all, both
M&eacute;chain and Messier were very careful observers, indicated by the fact 
that M102 is the only possible "non-object" left in the catalog, and only for 
3 further objects there were positional errors.  Also, as the descriptions for
M101 reads:
<blockquote>
<!dl>
<dt>March 27, 1781. 101. 13h 43m 28s, +55deg 24' 25". Diam. 7'.
<dd>Nebula without stars, very obscure and pretty large, between 6' and 7' in
  diameter, between the left hand of Bootes and the tail of Ursa Major.
  Difficult to distinguish when graticule lit.
<!/dl>
</blockquote>
it appears not necessarily obvious that this is the same object as M102,
with the description given above.  In addition, M&eacute;chain's "retraction"
occured over 2 years after the "discovery", giving room for speculations 
anyway, and it was never published in the <b>Connaissance des Temps</b>, where
Messier's catalog and supplements were first printed, although both astronomers
became associate editors of this periodic publication: Messier in 1785 and 
M&eacute;chain in 1786.
<p>
Moreover, Messier had added by hand a position for M102 to his personal copy 
of the catalog, which both Owen Gingerich and Kenneth Glyn Jones have claimed 
to be erroneous "because there is no obvious object". As Messier was 
certainly a careful observer, it is probable that he has seen 'something', but 
maybe he did a reduction error again. The question arises if he found another 
object, either one of the candidates discussed below, a comet, or even some 
completely other one ?  We will come back to this question later, as it 
suggests a very interesting possibility.
<p>
At last, there are at least two candidates, the more probable being
<a href="ngc5866.html">NGC 5866</a>, near the position M&eacute;chain describes; 
wouldn't one know of his letter mentioned above, today's astronomers would 
most probably believe that this was the observed object !
<p>
To step the way down, note that Omicron Bootis is about 40 degrees away and
south of Iota Draconis, thus (at least) one of them must be a mistype;
Admiral Smyth in his 'Bedford' Catalogue suggests the obvious possibility
that it must read 'Theta' instead of 'Omicron' Bootis.  The other possibility
would be, according to J.L.E. Dreyer in <b>Notes and Corrections to the
NGC</b>, that Iota Draconis was mistaken for Iota Serpentis; then M102 would
be situated near the position of the faint galaxy NGC 5928, at RA 15h23.9m,
Dec +18d15' (1950).
<p>
However, Dreyer's proposition of NGC 5928 can be waived with great certainty
for the obvious reason that it is only a 14th mag galaxy, according to the
RNGC [<a href="#RNGC">RNGC, 1973</a>], so that both M&eacute;chain and Messier 
could hardly have seen it with their instrumentation, even under exceptionally 
good conditions.  Thus we can also exclude Dreyer's assumption that Iota 
Draconis was a mistake for Iota Serpentis, since there's no sufficiently bright 
object in that region of the sky, and are left with the possibility proposed by 
Smyth, that Omicron Bootis was mistaken for Theta Bootis.
<p>
Between those stars, about 3 degrees SW of Iota Draconis, is a small group
of galaxies, the brighter of which could be viewed as candidates for M102:
<ul>
<li>NGC 5866 (William Herschel's H I.215, John Herschel's 1909),
           the brightest of the group at 10.0 mag vis.
<li>NGC 5879 (W.H.: H II.757, J.H.: h 1910), Smyth identified this as M102
<li>NGC 5907 (H II.759, h 1917), a bright edge-on galaxy.
<li>NGC 5908 (H II.760), too faint as a candidate.
</ul>
The most probable candidate is NGC 5866, as was first suggested by 
Camille Flammarion, who had acquired Messier's personal copies of his catalogue 
and observaitonal notes, see e.g. [<a href="#flammarion">Flammarion 1917</a>], 
and by Harlow Shapley and Helen Davis in their article 'The Messier Catalogue' 
in the <i>PASP</i> Vol. 29, and also printed in <i>The Observatory</i> Vol. 41 
(also mentioned by Glyn Jones).
<p>
Another fact makes <a href="ngc5866.html">NGC 5866</a> a good candidate for 
M102:
<br>
Imagine you want to find NGC 5866 with a telescope, how do you procede ?
I would look for the stars Iota Draconis and Theta Bootis and then locate
the 5.25 mag star GC 20332 (= HD 134190, SAO 29407) which is little more than 
1 degree south and almost exactly at the same right ascension.  This star is 
one of 5 in the rectangular region between RA/Dec limits given by the two 
stars and listed in Becvar's catalog of stars brighter than 6.25:<pre>
                        RA (1950.0)  Dec (1950) mag
       23 Theta Boo     14h23m48.8s  +52d04'52" 4.06
       GC 19627            30 56.9    55 37 03  5.99
       GC 19666            32 45.2    57 17 12  6.25
       GC 19742            36 40.0    54 14 19  5.52
     * GC 20332         15 04 59.9    54 44 53  5.21
       GC 20641            18 36.8    52 08 16  5.52
       12 Iota Dra      15 23 48.8    59 08 26  3.47
</pre>
(NGC 5866 is at RA 15h05.1m, Dec +55d57' for 1950.0).
A misestimate of a 5.25 as 6th mag star would eventually be not too far off, 
so that the `6th mag star' in Messier's description might be GC 20332.  
Then the description matches well with that visually 10th mag lenticular 
galaxy, as it appears probable that M&eacute;chain perhaps wanted to describe a 
route to his newly `discovered' object.  Another, though perhaps less 
probable, possibility is that the star mentioned is the 6.8 mag star 
HD 133666 (SAO 29393) lying only 0.4 degrees NW of NGC 5866. 
The good match of M&eacute;chain's description with this galaxy suggests that this 
may have been the object he had seen in his discovery observation.
<p>
However, as M&eacute;chain has disowned the discovery, one may keep the position
that due to his claim, M&eacute;chain's discovery was spurious and eventually a
duplicate observation of M101 as he claimed.  As also Don Machholz admits,
it may well be that he was correct with this statement, then there remains
only the puzzle of Messier's handwritten position.  
<p>
For me, the author of this article, some light came into this mystery when 
Dr. Don Greeley communicated to me the handwritten positions Messier had
added to his personal copy of the catalog printed in the 
<i>Connaissance des Temps</i> for 1784. He points out:
<blockquote>
The positions in Messier's catalog were very faded and difficult to interpret.
It was necesary to make a copy of that page so dark that the printing on
the page behind it showed through. I made a slide of the page and when 
projected on a flat white wall showed that <a href="m102.html">M102</a> was 
"14.40" in RA and "56." in Dec. <a href="m103.html">M103</a> was much harder 
to see but is probably "1.20" in RA and "61." in Dec. 
Now they must be corrected for precesion for modern charts.
</blockquote>
The acuracy of Messier's values is probably indicated by the rough decimals,
but for the following considerations I suppose them more acurate as they really
are. 
When precessed to modern times, there is little surprise that the position for
M103 becomes RA = 1:34.6, Dec = +62.1 (2000.0), close (little more than 1 degree 
north and very little east) to the correct position of this cluster, which is 
RA = 1:33.1, Dec = +60.7.
Messier's position of M102 becomes 
<p>
<center>
RA = 14:46.5, Dec = +55.1 (2000.0).
</center>
<p>
In accordance to the claims of Owen Gingerich and Kenneth Glyn Jones, there is
actually no striking object close to this position in the sky. It is however 
interesting that the position lies between the stars Iota Draconis and 
<i>Theta</i> Bootis (so that at least it is apparently validated that the 
"Omicron" in the description is a typo).
On a closer look, one also fails with a sign error in a positional difference, 
as it had occured for M47,
or a parallel shift due to taking a wrong reference star or object as for M91. 
But, and that is apparently most interesting, the position is almost exactly 
at the correct declination for NGC 5866 <i>and</i> M101, and it is <i>almost 
exactly</i> 5 degrees (20 min) west (preceding) of NGC 5866 in right ascension 
(is is also roughly 10 degrees east of M101, but much less acurately; the 2000.0 
position of NGC 5866 is RA 15:06.5, Dec +55.7, while that of M101 is
RA 14:03.2, Dec +54.3). 
The particular interest connected with this arises from the fact that another 
missing object, M48, was also measured nearly exactly 5 degrees false (in that 
case in declination, though). 
A look in the sources suggests that Messier has normally used sky charts with 
grids of lines every 5 degree, as e.g. his 
<a href="../xtra/history/m-charts.html">
chart showing the path of the comet of 1779</a>. 
Then a deviation of exactly 5 degrees 
may have several simple reasons: A wrongly labelled chart, an erroneous 
look on the neighboring label, a wrong count to an un-numbered tick, etc.
One should perhaps also keep in mind that M&eacute;chain, in his letter,
speculated that "M. Messier was confused due to an error in the sky-chart"!
<p>
Therefore, in the opinion of the present author, it appears probable that
Charles Messier has observed NGC 5866 when he measured the position of M102
(which he could probably locate without much difficulty because of M&eacute;chain's
acurate description), but due to some reductional error, plotted it exactly
5 degrees west (preceding) of its correct position.
<p>
To summarize:
<blockquote>
  The object that really deserves the designation "Messier 102" should be
  identical to one of the two observed by M&eacute;chain and Messier, may they be
  identical or not.  As nobody is still alive who has witnessed them during
  their observation and recording, we can currently not reconstruct what they
  actually observed.  M&eacute;chain's description gives good evidence that the
  object M102 could be NGC 5866, which most probably everybody would believe
  if he had not retracted the discovery in the letter mentioned, or if this
  letter had stayed forgotten.  It may now depend on taste to speculate
  which was erroneous:  The observation or the letter.  Moreover, Messier has 
  probably observed NGC 5866 and taken it for M102, but again made an error in
  data reduction. Once more, it is a question of taste if these facts entitle 
  the lenticular galaxy NGC 5866 to bear the designation "M102".
</blockquote>
At least, observers who want to go for sure that they observed all Messier
objects should thus turn their telescopes to aim NGC 5866.  They will be
rewarded by quite an easy, beautiful object.

</ul>

<h3>Sources identifying M102 with NGC 5866:</h3>

<ul>
<li>
  Pierre M&eacute;chain's description matches with NGC 5866, and
  Charles Messier's handwritten position in his personal copy of the 
  Catalogue is almost exactly 5 degrees off NGC 5866 (presumably a data 
  reduction error).
<li>
  Camille Flammarion, who had Messier's personal copies of and observing
  notes related to his catalogue, has known Messier's handwritten position, 
  and tentatively identified M102 with NGC 5866, see e.g.
  [<a href="#flammarion">Flammarion 1917</a>].
<li>
  Harlow Shapley and Helen Davies, in 'The Messier Catalogue', published in
  <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1917PASP...29..177S">   
  <i>PASP</i> Vol. 29 (1917)</a> and also in <i>The Observatory</i>, No. 41,
  are also among the first who suggested that M102 could be NGC 5866.
  They quote a letter from Prof. Bailley:
  <blockquote>
  Messier's list comprises one hundred and three objects. For all of them,
  positions are given, except for 102 and 103. For these only the
  descriptions are given, as follows:
  <p>
  102. Nebuleuse entre les etoiles Omicron du Bouvier and [sic!] Jota du
  Dragon; elle est tres-faible; pres d'elle est une etoile de la sixieme
  grandeur [Nebula betrween the stars Omicron Bootis and Jota Draconis;
  it is very faint; near it is a star of sixth magnitude].
  <p>
  103. Amas d'etoiles entre Epsilon et Delta de la jambe de Cassiopeia
  [Cluster of stars between Epsilon and Delta Cassiopeiae].<br>
  By a star chart, or the sky, you will see that, taken as it stands, no
  object could be well selected for M102, since Omicron Bootis is too far
  from Jota Draconis. If, however, Omicron is a misprint for Theta, it
  becomes intelligible, and M102 is perhaps <i>N.G.C.</i> 5866, altho in
  Norton's Atlas it is apparently identified as <i>N.G.C.</i> 5979. On our
  photographs, however, <i>N.G.C.</i> 5866 appears to be the brightest object
  in this region.
  </blockquote>
  Shapley and Davis remark that "The visual observations of these neighboring
  nebulae by the Herschels show <i>N.G.C.</i> 5866 much the brighter, and its
  identity with M 102 can be accepted as quite probable."
<li>
  Don Machholz in his Messier Marathon Observer's Guide
  [<a href="#machholz">Machholz 1994</a>].
  Don Machholz also discusses the subject and comes to similar conclusions
  as the present author.
<li>
  Antonin Becvar in his
  `Atlas Coeli, Atlas of the Heavens - II, Catalogue 1950.0', 1964
  gives in the `Anagalactic Nabulae' section for NGC 5866 the alternative
  name M102 (p. 329 or S21).  Oddly, in the `Catalogue of Messier' section
  on p. 339 or M3, he gives
  <blockquote>
    M 102 = NGC 5866, Type S [galaxy], [No other data], Notes: `= M 101'
  </blockquote>
  Perhaps this reflects the situation :-)
<li>
  Hans Vehrenberg, in his <i>Atlas of Deep Sky Splendors</i>, claims that
  Owen Gingerich has added it, which I do not believe because Gingerich
  [<a href="#ginger">Gingerich 1960</a>]
  claims the opposite. This claim is possibly based on a report by Paul 
  Ahnert in his <i>Kalender f&uuml;r Sternfreunde 1962</i>, p. 164-166.
  It seems that this - presumably erroneous - claim also found its way
  into recent work such as 
  Harvard Pennington's <i>The Year-Round Messier Marathon</i> and 
  George R. Kepple's and Glen W. Sanner's <i>The Night Sky Observer's
  Guide</i> (Vol. 2).
<li>
  RNGC [<a href="#RNGC">RNGC, 1973</a>], p. 273, gives M102 as alternative 
  name for NGC 5866.
<li>
  Landolt/B&ouml;rnstein, in their monumental encyclopedia, list NGC 5866
  as M102 in their Volume 6, 1, chapter 9, where they have a table of NGC
  numbers of Messier's galaxies.
<li>
  Erich Karkoschka in his Atlas. Karkoschka states in the description to
  chart N16 (I must translate from the German edition):
  <blockquote>
    ``Messier's list contains as its object 102 a galaxy [it's the first
    time I hear that Messier did know that - hf] near the position of NGC
    5866.  However, his description points to a duplication of M101 [I
    cannot verify this, see both descriptions given above; my impression
    is more that NGC 5866 might match the description - hf].  Did Messier
    do a mistake of 1 hour in right ascension [How, as he gave no measured
    position :-) - hf] ? Therefore, the designation M102 is nonunique.''

<h3>Sources with other identifications:</h3>

<ul>
<li>
  Admiral Smyth proposes either NGC 5879 or NGC 5866. Kenneth Glyn Jones
  gives his description:
  <blockquote>
    `A small but brightish nebula on the belly of Draco with four small
    stars spreading across field N of it.  Doubt as to wether this is the
    nebula discovered by M&eacute;chain in 1781 since Messier describes it as
    ``very faint'', situated between Omicron Bootis and Iota Draconis.  If
    Omicron Bootis should be Theta Bootis, this is probably the object seen
    by M&eacute;chain and J.H.'s 1910, being the brightest nebula of five in that
    vicinity.'
  </blockquote>
  The problem is that John Herschel's number 1910 is NGC 5879, which is
  however <b>not</b> the brightest of the group; the brightest is NGC 5866.
<li>
  Dreyer (NGC) oddly proposes 14th mag galaxy NGC 5928.
