<h3> Abstract </h3>
</center>

The unannotated regions of the Escherichia coli genome DNA sequence
      from the EcoSeq6 database, totaling 1,278 'intergenic' sequences of
      the combined length of 359,279 base pairs, were analyzed using
      computer-assisted methods with the aim of identifying putative
      unknown genes. The proposed strategy for finding new genes includes
      two key elements: i) prediction of expressed open reading frames
      (ORFs) using the GeneMark method based on Markov chain models for
      coding and non-coding regions of Escherichia coli DNA, and ii)
      search for protein sequence similarities using programs based on the
      BLAST algorithm and programs for motif identification. A total of
      354 putative expressed ORFs were predicted by GeneMark. Using the
      BLASTX and TBLASTN programs, it was shown that 208 ORFs located in
      the unannotated regions of the E. coli chromosome are significantly
      similar to other protein sequences. Identification of 182 ORFs as
      probable genes was supported by GeneMark and BLAST, comprising 51.4%
      of the GeneMark 'hits' and 87.5% of the BLAST 'hits'. 73 putative
      new genes, comprising 20.6% of the GeneMark predictions, belong to
      ancient conserved protein families that include both eubacterial and
      eukaryotic members. This value is close to the overall proportion of
      highly conserved sequences among eubacterial proteins, indicating
      that the majority of the putative expressed ORFs that are predicted
      by GeneMark, but have no significant BLAST hits, nevertheless are
      likely to be real genes. The majority of the putative genes
      identified by BLAST search have been described since the release of
      the EcoSeq6 database, but about 70 genes have not been detected so
      far. Among these new identifications are genes encoding proteins
      with a variety of predicted functions including dehydrogenases,
      kinases, several other metabolic enzymes, ATPases, rRNA
      methyltransferases, membrane proteins, and different types of
      regulatory proteins.
