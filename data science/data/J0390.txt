			<P><HR COLOR="#FF6F0F">Why is THE SUPERCAR EXPERIENCE different?</P>
			<P>There are other businesses in Australia offering &quot;V8 Supercar&quot; hot laps or similar.<BR>
			What is it that makes The Supercar Experience different from the others?</P>
			<P>That's pretty simple to answer. Many of these small businesses are offering rides in what amounts to warmed-up road cars or retired, detuned AUSCARs.
			And most often they're not on slicks (sticky enough to last only a day), but just on road registerable tyres (designed to last a year or more). This can never be a real V8 Supercar experience.</P>

		<TR>
			<TD>
			<P>Twenty years ago, a professional driver took a teenage Mal Rose around a real racing circuit in a real racing car. From that moment, Mal was hooked.
			He has never forgotten the thrill of that ride, and now he wants to share it with you - in a much faster car - his <FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">V8 COMMODORE SUPERCARS</FONT>, Australia's premier motorsport class of car.
			</P>
			
			<P>From the outset, Mal decided that he would provide only the REAL racing car experience, as close as possible to 
			real racing acceleration, braking and cornering. And he would only use experienced, champion drivers (<I>like himself - no time for modesty!</I>).
			The result is that you get the closest possible thing to actually being in Konica or Shell series race. You simply can't get two people together any faster around the circuit!</P>

			<P>Why don't the others do the same? Well, the answer to that is simple too. The costs involved in buying and maintaining a real
			V8 supercar are an order of magnitude greater than a souped-up road car. Everything on Mal's V8 Supercar Commodores is custom-made, race-spec., and very expensive.

			<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Some cost examples:</FONT></P>
			
		<UL>
		<LI>Cars that costs, second hand, about $150,000 each. Without a motor!<BR>&nbsp;
		<LI>600hp Chev engines that cost between $50,000 and $75,000 each, and need to be rebuilt every 3000 km.<BR>&nbsp;
		<LI>11 inch Bridestone "control" slicks that cost $450 each but only last a couple of hours under Mal's lead foot (now Dunlops for 2002).<BR>&nbsp;
		<LI>Six piston brake calipers capable of stopping a 1350kg car from 290kph, all day long, without fade.<BR>&nbsp;
		<LI>Amazingly strong brake pads costing $1700 per set (that's just the fronts!)<BR>&nbsp;
		<LI>6-speed Holinger gearbox $20,000. Clutch $12,000. Diff $15,000. And so on.<BR>&nbsp;
		<LI>State of the art Safety systems - rollcage, bodyshell, harnesses, dry-break fuel and fire systems, etc.<BR>&nbsp;
		<LI>A two-car team that costs, conservatively, a million dollars a year to compete in the Konica or Shell series.

			<P>You're probably getting the picture.</P>
			<P>It all adds up to a ride at a pace just a couple of seconds outside
			current qualifying pace at that circuit. So, if you're looking for a high adrenalin gift, please do shop around
			before you commit to a ride. But please ask this question - do you want the <FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">REAL V8 SUPERCAR EXPERIENCE</FONT>, or perhaps just a ride in a warmed-up road car?</P>
			<P>The difference is chalk and cheese.
