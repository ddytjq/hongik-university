The earliest Left handed DNA that we are aware of
is an Israeli stamp from 1964.
The image was sent to me by
<a href = "http://www.biochem.purdue.edu/~bmb/faculty/tess.html">Irwin Tessman</a>
(Department of Biological Sciences
Purdue University
West Lafayette IN 47907-1392).

He says
"The stamp came to my attention via the paper (Acc. Chem. Res. 1992,
25:24-31) by Zvi Rappoport on chemophilately, which shows the stamp in the
lower right corner of Figure 2, ... and is described
and highlighted on page 30."

The stamp is in 
"Chemistry on stamps (chemophilately)".

It is in the lower right corner of Figure 2, and is described
on page 30 as having 'the "abnormal" helicity of DNA'.

<li> Until Dr. Tessman informed me otherwise in November 1998,
the earliest example I was aware of is a beautiful
drawing of a circular plasmid by the <b>Beckman Company</b>
published around 1980.  "Our experience covers
over 40 years of innovation and unmatched quality".

<li>
On the cover of
Nature Volume 284 Number 5757,
17 April 1980 is on left handed "Selfish DNA"
(a series of left-handed twisting snakes eating each other in
a circle).
The person who found it writes:
<blockquote>
<p>
Hi there!  Yes, I am a Newsweek reader.  I am also an artist responsible for
perhaps one of the first left-handed boo-boos.
</p><p>
My husband and his old advisor (Doolittle and Sapienza) wrote a piece on
"Selfish DNA" that was accepted by Nature.  Their paper and another by Crick
and Orgel became the magazine's cover topic.  Lucky me!  I got to draw for
Nature!
</p><p>
No one noticed that my design was left-handed until the journal was in press.
I will admit that the scientists thought it was pretty funny (well, what
could they do at that point?).
</p><p>
In the US the background color was an ugly light orange, but the British
version was a vivid red.
<!--
I have copies of the red cover if you would like
one (however, I don't own the copyright, and so I'd assume you'd have to ask
Nature about that).

<!--
It is Nature Volume 284 Number 5757

I'm starting to feel like a real part of history here...uh, infamous too.

<b>The Cartoon Guide To Genetics</b>

<b> Larry Gonick and Mark Wheelis </b> (Barnes & Noble, NY, 1983),
is a wonderful and funny introduction but unfortunately the

The cover of the

In a letter

John H. Wilson and Peter B. Berget point out that
in the advertisement for the
Symposium: Molecular Biology Now & Tomorrow was a DNA that was
simultaneously left and right handed!

In the section on "Astonishing Machines of Replication"

there is a figleaf covering the point of DNA replication,
all of the strands coming out of it are left handed.

After that you can look at each year individually
from the table below.
Note:  just because a year has gone by does not mean
we haven't found more examples for that year!
