<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The purpose of this short file is to get an approximation of the route around
a circle/sphere/hypersphere that collapses to zero size when we look around
it exactly one time.   For the moment, I'll confine the discussion to simple
calculus (which implicitly incorporates Newtonian mechanics).   All I'm interested
in here is to derive the lower limit of a likely range in which an antipode
is most likely to occur in Riemannian space.     
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> To start, suppose we're on a circle/sphere/hypersphere with a radius
r that remains constant as we look or travel around it.   The circumference
of our route here is 2<font face="symbol">p</font>r. </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Next let's assume we're on the same structure with the same radius r
from the center, except  this time the structure we occupy is expanding in
such a manner that, when we look or travel around it exactly one time, it
contracts to zero size. </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> What is the circumference here? </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> This is one of those problems where you have to spend more time thinking
about how to  <em>set up</em> the  integral than it does to <em>solve</em>
 it.   The way I do it is to assume  a clock's hour hand represents a unit
radius at the 12 o'clock position.   Since there are 60  minutes in an hour
and 60 seconds in a minute, then there are 3600 seconds in an hour, and the
 hour hand advances one arc degree every 10 seconds (since 3600 seconds/360
degrees = 10  seconds/degree).   When the hour hand moves one arc degree
every ten seconds, its length shrinks by 1/360.  </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> By the time the hour hand reaches the 3 o'clock position the hour hand
is three-fourths as long as the unit length, half as long at six o'clock,
and one-fourth as long at nine o'clock.   Finally, by the time the hour hand
reaches the 12 o'clock position one hour later, it shrinks to nothing. </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> The length of the route here is determined by: </p>
<pre>
</pre>
<center>integral from 0 to 1 of 2<font face="symbol">p</font>r dr. </center>
<pre>
</pre>  
<p> Although the integral reverses the direction of the route compared to
the way it was first  presented (which doesn't make any difference since
we're only interested in the relative  length), we're solving for the circumference
of a route where the radius starts off at zero and  goes to the unit length
when we go around the circle/sphere/hypersphere exactly one time .   And
the path we're following would be the one traced by the tip of the radius
that behaves in this manner.    </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> When you solve the simple integral, you'll find that the length of the
circumference is <font face="symbol">p</font>r.   </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> So the circumference of the circle/sphere/hypersphere with a <em>uniformly
shrinking</em>  radius is half as long as the circumference with a <em>constant</em>
 radius.   (Is this a  surprise?) </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Next take the full integral from 0 to 1 and divide it into two integrals:
the first from 0 to 1/2, and the second from 1/2 to 1. &nbsp; The first integral
traces the route in a counterclockwise direction, beginning with a zero length
radius at the 12 o'clock position and moves past nine o'clock to the six
o'clock position, where the length of the radius is 1/2. &nbsp; And the second&nbsp;
integral continues the route from&nbsp; six o'clock, past three o'clock,
to the 12 o'clock position,&nbsp; where the radius now has the original unit
length. </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> You'll find that the first integral has a length of <font face="symbol">
p</font>/4 while the length  of the second integral is 3<font face="symbol">
p</font>/4.   In other words as we look around the  clock (clockwise direction,
this time), we've already looked past three-fourths of the total  circumference
by the time our line of sight reaches the six o'clock position. </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> And since the six o'clock position represents the opposite side of this
shrinking circle and  since the opposite sides of a circle/sphere/hypersphere
coincide, this analysis tells us that  the antipode of this hypersphere must
be three-fourths of the way around.   (This is  another application of "embeddedness",
 which evolves from the topological principle that whatever happens in S<sup>
2</sup> also happens in S<sup>3</sup>, as explained in <a href="hierarchy(1).html">
Essay #1</a>.) </p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote> <font color="red"> [And it's kind of interesting to know at
what relative distance do we pass the "equator" the <em>first</em> time?
  Answer: 7/16ths (or 0.4375) of the distance to the collapsed receding site.
  We pass the equator the <em>second</em> time at 15/16ths (or 0.9375) of
the total distance to the collapsed position.   Simply plug in 0 to 3/4 and
0 to 1/4 in the integral above and you'll get these two answers by subtracting
the result of the respective integrals from 1. </font>
  <p> <font color="red">But we have to be cautious by <em>not</em> necessarily
assuming that objects pass through a minimum at 7/16ths of the way to the
singularity.   Relativity will push that minimum further out, to roughly
2/3rds of the way toward the antipode, provided there is an antipode within
our Hubble horizon that is at least 3/4ths of the total distance from here to the singularity.] </font> </p>
  </blockquote>
 
  <p>  </p>
  <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Next the red shift in a simplified zero-density universe is given by 
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <center>z + 1 = [(1 + <font face="symbol">b</font>)/(1 - <font face="symbol">
b</font>)]^0.5</center>
 
  <p> where z is the red shift and <font face="symbol">b</font> is the velocity
of recession (v) divided by the speed of light (c).    </p>
  <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> The structure we inhabit is expanding and the farther we look out along
this curved route the faster objects are receding.    If we suppose the
collapsed central location is receding at the  speed of light, which duplicates
the velocity of recession of the singularity in the actual  universe, then
the red shift of a position three-fourths of the way toward the singularity
must  have a red shift of z = 1.65.   (Simply insert .75 for <font face="symbol">
b</font> in the above  equation and solve it.) </p>
  <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> And if space is <em>accelerating</em> (as the studies of supernovae in recent years clearly indicate), the antipode must be further
than three-fourths of the way from here to the singularity.   If we use the most reasonable
values for the Hubble parameter, relative density, and the inferred cosmological
constant, the red shift of a position three-fourths of the way from here
to the singularity is up around 2.  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <blockquote><font color="#1F1FFF"> <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Assuming we
look "around" Riemann's 4D hypersphere <em>once</em> as we look toward the
singularity, nothing particularly unusual as a result of this structure is
likely to happen to our observations until we get to <em>at least</em> three-fourths
of the way toward the singularity, at a red shift that <em>exceeds</em> z
= 2. </font> </blockquote>
 
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Nothing unusual happens consistently anywhere <em>below</em> three-fourths
of the way to the singularity or when z &lt; 2, but things get rather interesting
at higher red shifts (which they should if the idea about the hyperspheric
model in a universe with acceleration is correct). </p>
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> To decide whether or not the proposed "spiral" route is a reasonable
approximation, the  objective is to determine whether or not there's an antipode
lurking out there someplace in deep space, presumably at least three-fourths
of the way toward the singularity. </p>
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Thank you for reading my additional scribblings!

 PS: If (1) the universe <em>is</em> a Riemannian hypersphere and (2) we
look around it just <em>once</em> as we look toward the singularity, it's
an <em>asymmetric</em> hypersphere, with the antipode much closer to the
singularity than it is to us.
