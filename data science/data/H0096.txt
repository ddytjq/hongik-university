EN-GB'>HUMAN ORIGIN</span><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>:
&quot;- - - in your paper on the origin of humans, I see that you failed to
mention <i>Oreopithecus</i>, the Italian primate discovered in Baccinello,
Italy during the 1950's. <i>Oreopithecus</i> was thought to prove that hominids
evolved in an island environment. - - - &quot;<br>
My answer</span><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Arial;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'>:</span><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> During the
previous century a lot of fossils were presented as the &quot;missing
link&quot;; most of them surely were not. I remember the discovery of <i>Orepithecus</i>
as a sensation, surely because it was European. <i>Oreopithecus</i> could be a
hominoid and human ancestor, one of the brachiator apes that were abundant in
the forests of Northern Africa and Southern Europe of that time. <br>
I cannot see, however, why that particular fossil proves that hominoids evolved
in island environment; at the most it proves that some hominoids lived in such
environment, and not much can be concluded of that. The idea may be forwarded
as an argument of the AAT, &quot;aquatic ape theory&quot; or &quot;amphibious
ancestors theory&quot;.<br>
Fossils of the age of <i>Oreopitecus</i> - Late Miocene, 15 mill.years ago -
cannot give much information on human origin, only that we had tree-living ape-ancestors
at that time. The evolution of man took place much later, in Pleistocene, at
least 5 mill. years ago, as <i>Australopitecus</i> - about 3 - 4 mill. years
ago - undoubtly a human ancestor, was distinctly ape-like, but with the
upright, two-legged stance and obviously at the beginning of mankind.<br>
What I deal with in my essay, a proposal of how we crossed the border between
animal and man, can hardly be seen from fossils.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Paul Mazza,</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> Curator of the Museum of Natural
History Geology and Paleontology Dept.University of Florence, Italy, mailed
this:<br>
---- I read your letter on <em>Oreopithecus</em>. I'm writing from the Museum
of Geology and Paleontology of Florence, Italy, where most of the <em>Oreopithecus</em>
material is kept. The <em>Oreopithecus</em> specimens all come from a layer,
which overlies a tephra layer dated 9-8 million years. So the fossil material
is slightly younger, some 8 to 7 million years old, and not 15 million as you
told.<br>
<strong>My answer:</strong> Thank you very much for your information. According
to my source (Conroy, Glenn C. (1990), Primate Evolution), <em>Oreopithecus</em>
is of late Miocene. I hurry to bring your information as a comment to my web
site.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Kaitlin Smith</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> had this information to the article
on human origin:<br>
I thought that your page could do a bit better if you correlated your logic
with the hominid fossil record. Let me point out that brachiators are not the
agreed-upon common ancestors of chimps and humans. According to a 1996 study by
Dan L. Gebo in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, the direct
ancestor was a terrestrial quadruped. Certainly it seems brachiator and human
clavicles seem to resemble each other the most, but remember there are
paleoanthropologists with opposing viewpoints, e.g., Johanson, I believe,
thinks it was an arborealist.<br>
Furthermore, it seems that a simple rain forest to savannah transition is much
too simplistic. According to a 1994 study by Kingston et al. in the journal
Science, there were a variety of different environments prevalent in Africa
from 10 to 5 million years ago or somewhere around that. Further studies by
Marino et al. and deMenocal et al. confirmed their conclusions. Also, the
earliest fossil hominid, Ardipithecus ramidus, was discovered associated with
woodland species, indicating that it was a forest-dweller. <br>
Third point, there are many explanations for bipedalism, among them the Man the
Provisioner theory, Alternative Responses theory, Thermoregulation theory,
Woman the Gatherer theory, Postural Feeding theory, Efficiency theory, and recently
Stanford's polished-up version of Wrangham's Man the Hunter theory. ... Well,
you get the idea. The &quot;why&quot; of bipedalism is an area of
paleoanthropology which generates more heat than light. You can find a
description (not very in-depth) of Lovejoy's Man the Provisioner model in Johanson's
book &quot;Lucy&quot;, 1981. As for the others, information is scarce, but do a
search and you'll find them. <br>
<strong>My answer:</strong> You are quite right; it should be a good thing to
refer to the fossil record or other hard evidence, but unfortunately fossils
cannot possibly tell how we acquired the upright two-legged stance, not to say
how we had our unique sexual behaviour, and how we began to talk and think and
had consciousness. The questions on how we became human must be answered only
by speculation; I cannot think of any other way. <br>
As for brachiators as direct ancestors of man, I think it is the most adequate
explanation of our shoulder-structure with the shoulder blades on the backside
of the breast.<br>
The transformation of the rain forests of North Africa into savannah was a
gradual process that lasted for likely 5 million years. And in this period
North Africa was a mixture of various environments where bipedal plain-dwellers
might pretty well have co-existed with forest-dweller. In my article I
simplified this process. <br>
The fossil <i>Ardipithecus (Australopithecus) ramidus</i>, about 4 millions old
and considered to be bipedal, may thus at an early stage of bipedality have
returned to live in forest, and it may even have taken-up the sloping manner of
walking, supporting on the fists and been a chimpanzee-ancestor.<br>
In course of time it has been proposed numerous theories on how man acquired
the two-footed, upright manner of walking, and most of them supposed that our
nearest ancestors walked four-footed on the ground like chimpanzees and
gorillas. Their problem is therefore to<i> </i>explain<i> </i>why the human
ancestors alone abandoned this rather comfortable manner of walking to adopt
the uncomfortably slow and tiresome upright stance. <br>
With the gibbons as a model I suggest that our closest tree-dwelling ancestors
facultative used a bipedal/quadruped locomotion on the ground and that those
which walked sloping and supported on the arms, were <i>relatively</i> the most
exposed to predators. The upright stance was in no way a protection against
predators, but gave just a slightly greater chance to survive. In course of
time this gave the upright walking prevalence to the sloping. <br>
<b>Kaitlin Smith </b>has this additional notion<b>:</b> I think that still
there is a tremendous amount of controversy regarding whether Ardipithecus is
truly a hominid, and some paleoanthropologists think not, according to Tim
White by personal communication. Secondly, place of death does not necessarily
mean habitual environment, although in most cases it does. But other than that,
I agree. <br>
<b>My comment: </b>In my essays I don&#8217;t refer to the fossil record, as the only
fossil of relevance I can think of is &quot;<span style='color:red'><a
href="homcomsup.htm#Lucy"><span style='color:red'>Lucy</span></a></span>&quot;<i>
<span style='color:black'>Australopithecus afarensis</span></i>, and other
fossilised parts of the same species, together with the </span><a
href="homcomsup.htm#Footprints"><span lang=EN-GB style='color:red;mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'>footprints of Laetoli</span></a><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'>. That fossil is evidence that 3 - 4 mill. years ago, lived upright
two-legged primates with human shaped bodies and ape-like heads. <br>
Surely it lived several kinds of such hominids, split up with great diversity
but with common traits; some tall and robust, others small and gracile, some
might have been quick and alert, whereas others were slow and dull. Some lived
mostly on soft vegetables, others on hard vegetables as kernels and such;
others may have lived on meat. And they lived in groups - tribes, races, ethnic
groups, species or whatever it might be called - some groups living closely
together, other groups separated by long distances. Some groups lived at shores
of rivers and lakes; others lived near forests or mountains, any group in each
kind of environment. Out of such a hotchpotch group of miscellaneous upright,
bipedal hominids grew new jumble groups of upright, bipedal primates out of
which the human species originated. Textbooks have names and descriptions of
various hominid fossils of this period and enumerate their similarities and
dissimilarities, but it cannot reasonably be expected to decide from which
particular group humans arose.<br>
Previous to the hominid group it must have existed other unclearly defined
groups of brachiatory primates with hominid and pongoid traits. Some of these
might have been able to walk upright bipedally. Surely they split up into
various species, some of them might have lived in open spaces and others in
bush lands, and each group adapted to its particular environment and manner of
living. In course of time - say about 4 - 5 mill. years - many species died out
and new ones emerged. Textbooks on palearchaeology are filled with descriptions
and names of fossils of such primates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Kaitlin
Smith </span></b><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>has also this
additional notion<b>:</b> However, let me point out that although predators may
be more difficult to detect from a quadrupedal standpoint, quadrupeds are still
faster than bipeds, especially on the savannah.<br>
Personally, I tend to favour Isbell and Young's Alternative Responses
Hypothesis. The gist of it is that bipedalism was more efficient in the sense
of more land traversed per day, and as food became scarcer and more widely
scattered during the Miocene cooling, it became imperative to travel longer
distances to reach the food sources to support a larger group size. There were
two responses to this climatic shift: (1) Smaller, fission-fusion groups and
retained quadrupedalism, (2) same group size and evolved bipedalism. Their
actual paper was more complex than that, with an upper limit to the
favourability of the second approach and intra-group and inter-group scramble
and strength competition, etc., but that's the basic idea. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>My
answer: </span></b><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Thank you
for calling attention to Isbell and Young&#8217;s article.<br>
Generally quadrupeds are faster on the ground than bipeds. The problem is, however,
if human bipedallity evolved from a quadrupedal manner of walking. My proposal
is that we did not. And neither did chimpanzees and gorillas, which are quadrupedal
only in the sense that they support on the forelimbs. They support on the
knuckles of their fists, which is a particular manner of walking quite unlike
walking of four-footed mammals. Monkeys support on the whole palm of their
hands.<br>
My claim is that the African apes are secondarily quadrupedal, which quality
they evolved from the hominid bipedallity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

  the walking gibbons! (Fig.2) Their usual manner of locomotion is
  arm-swinging, brachiation, in the treetops. They hardly ever support on the
  arms when they walk on the ground, but run on the hind leg. Look at the
  picture and imagine that it had shorter arms; that is how our early ancestors
  and the ancestors of the big apes should be supposed to look like and how
  they should be supposed to walk on the ground. As they had to stay on the
  ground, they must either adapt to the upright manner, or they must bend
  forward and support on their hands that were not suited for that. None of
  these manners of walking are in any way comfortable or fast. The hominids
  adopted the upright manner and changed their pelvis, their spine, their
  thighs, knees and feet as well as their skull. <br>
  The African apes adopted the forward bend and arm-support and changed their

p. 382 - 385), is published an article &quot;<em>Evidence that humans evolved
from a knuckle-walking ancestor</em>&quot; by Brian G. Richmond and David S.
Strait.<br>
The proposed evidence is that the wrist-bones of <em>Australopithecus afarensis</em>
and <em>Australopithecus anamensis</em> exhibit a specialized morphology that
stabilizes the wrist during knuckle-walking, similar to that of the
knuckle-walking African apes, and not found in later human ancestors. This
indicates that these bipedal hominids had knuckle-walking ancestors. <br>
This evidence confirms that the human ancestors, when they dismounted the
trees, sometimes tottered erect on their hind legs and sometimes stooped
supporting on the knuckles. Then they adopted hand- and wrist morphology as
demonstrated by Richmond and Strait. The chimps and gorillas, which became
obligatory knuckle- walkers, maintained this wrist morphology whereas the
hominids, which became upright walkers when they left the forests, reduced it.
The obviously bipedal Australophitecus represents an intermediate state with
yet not reduced knuckle-walking wrist morphology.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<b>My answer:</b> Hominid footprints of <i>Australopithecus</i>, dated to
approximately 3.6 mya and discovered at Laetoli, Northern Africa, are entirely
humanlike and show a well-developed arch. As Australopithecines of that age

went to the website and observed the mock-up of 'Lucy's' foot. I t appears
'hinged' between the fingers (toes) and the heel. In the human foot we see that
the rigidity between the footpad and the heel is what maintains the high arch.
Am I missing something here? The foot of the &quot;Lucy&quot; type creature
seems incapable of maintaining a fixed arch that would necessarily negate the
grasping abilities of the large toe (the thumb like appendage). <br>
<b>My comments: </b>Between the heel bone and the toes is in human foot is a
group of bones all hinged together into the rigid, but flexible arch. As to be
seen from the footprints of Laetoli &#8216;Lucy&#8217;s&#8217; foot was arched in the same
manner, and no doubt it consisted of the same bones connected in the same
manner. &#8216;Lucy&#8217; and her kind were surely no more able to grasp by the big toe
than modern humans are. The grasping ability of the feet as in apes and monkeys
was surely a capacity that vanished at a very early stage when the human
ancestors ceased to live in the woods and adapted to live in the plain-lands.
The first step was to turn the food like that of apes and monkeys and to align
and lengthen the big-toes in order to let them support the entire burden of the
body, and the next step was to evolve the arch, making the foot more flexible
and comfortable to walk on. <br>
Generally it is very uncertain when in the human evolution the various human
traits evolved as fossils seldom reveals such things, but the rare exception,
thanks to the fossilised foot-steps of Lately, is the particular structure of
the human foot.<br>

As far as the 'mock-up&quot; of &#8216;Lucy's&#8217; foot, I was referring to the drawing
of the human foot compared to the foot that probably made the fossilised
footprints. It is at the web page you sent me to. I only called it Lucy's foot
because the article said that the creatures were of the same type. I think it
wonderful that we were able to discover these footprints! Is there any way to
get a picture close-up of an individual print. I'm sure that the Archaeologist

our hands. </span><a href="http://home13.inet.tele.dk./palm/homcom.htm#Fig.4."><span

style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> The 1st.toe - the one that resembles the thumb
- was shorter than the other toes and separated from these. That toe was, just
as the thumb, the strongest and able to meet the other toes in a firm grip.<br>
That kind of feet is excellent for tree climbing, but when our ancestors
migrated to the plains and adopted the upright, two-legged manner of walking,
their feet had to be changed. When walking upright the heels carry the body,
but long, strong toes are needed not to tumble forwards. And as the 1.st toe
was the strongest, this toe came to perform this function, but due to its
shortness it was lesser apt for it. In walking the foot therefore was bend so that
the entire foot was arched so that only the heel and the toes met the ground.
That manner of walking can be seen in apes when they sometimes walk upright. <br>
In human the foot was elongated and the 1.st toe was aligned and it became
stronger and more protruding than the other toes and it was no longer
opposable, but it was still separated from the other toes. It may be that shape
of such a foot that made the </span><a href="homcomsup.htm#Footprints"><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>As for your
claim that evolution didn't take place: In short&nbsp;you must distinguish
between evolution as the historical events which lead to the existence of man
and&nbsp;other living organisms, and the scientific theory on how man and organisms&nbsp;<i>may</i>
have originated, if not created by God. We cannot ever <i>prove </i>that the
origin of man and living organisms is due to an evolutionary process; in the
end it is a&nbsp;matter of belief just as the belief in&nbsp;God's Creation.
You may formulate the question something like:&nbsp;How did man and other
living organisms originate, if God did not create them. As I have read it:
&quot;The Bible tells that God created plants, animals and human, but it does
not tell how God did that!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
God&nbsp;is not a magician he might have used evolution as&nbsp;his
means.&quot; I may add: If God obeyed the second law of thermodynamics, he
should have created man and other living organisms by means of evolution!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that is an essential point;&nbsp;the&nbsp;theory of evolution is useful to
explain in a scientific manner many biological and geological

answer: </span></b><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Thank you
for your mail. I never claimed that man is an ape. The question is not if human
is a special being created by God, or if we are a product of an evolutionary
process. This is a question of belief, so what I try is to demonstrate that the
evolutionary process <i>may </i>explain the origin of a two-legged, upright
walking, talking and thinking creature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>If you
consider yourself as created by God, and that is surely what you mean, you may
think that such a demonstration is of no relevancy. But many people, also good
Christians, don&#8217;t believe in the Creation, and to those my article may be interesting
as it demonstrates how the most human character of all, the consciousness or
the feeling of individuality, may have arisen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

for your email too. I appreciate your mature way of respecting my beliefs. I
agree with you when you said that some Christians do not believe in Creation. -
- - How can you believe this theory when it has repetitively been proven
incorrect or invalid?<br>
<b>My answer: </b>Consider that we are talking about belief versus a scientific
theory. If you are convinced of the divine creation of man, evolution is
nothing but a complicated manner of explaining. I am not convinced, but need
this step-by-step explanation.<br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:27.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>I am not able to accept the Genesis of the
Bible as it contrasts to many established fact, but I think that the evolutionary
theory of man&#8217;s origin is<br>
consistent with Christianity as expressed by the Gospels. I may even think that
evolution was God&#8217;s means to make man.<br>
<br>
What is necessary to Christianity is not if man originates from apes or is
created by a divine act. It is if man is a being who is able to believe in God,<br>
to understand the words of Jesus Christ, to pray, and - which is the essential
underlying quality - is an individual, responsible of his doings, receptive to<br>
the forgiveness of sins and the Resurrection.<br>
<br>
The hindrance of many Christians to accept evolution is the inability of the
traditional Darwinian theory to explain this difference of man from animals.<br>
That hindrance is what I try to remove by my article. On the other hand do many
people disavow from Christianity because of their inability to accept the<br>
Genesis of the Bible. Also to them - I hope - to have removed a hindrance,
displaying that Christianity and Evolution are consistent.<br>
<b>Anna </b>mailed me<b>: </b>First of all, how can Christianity and the
evolution theory coincide? They are a contradiction, an oxymoron. I believe it
says in Gen. 1:1 that God created the heavens and the earth. I understand that
you do not believe this. How can you not believe this verse, but believe other
verses in God's Word? This seems like &quot;riding the fence,&quot; or being
lukewarm. Both of these are forbidden in the walk of faith. <br

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:27.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>As for you understanding of Christianity, I can
almost fully relate. Christianity is accepting the inability to abstain from
sinful desires and <br>
asking Jesus Christ, who died on a cross for all, to forgive and cleanse our
sins. In order to be forgiven, you must have faith. This faith spreads into <br>
prayer, worship, and His Word. If you don't believe Him, what good is His Word?<br

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:27.0pt'><span lang=EN-GB
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>In addition, how does Creationism
&quot;contrast to many established fact?&quot; It is fact! There are numerous
faults that have been proven against the <br>
evolution theory. If you would like to ignore these, then you are just denying
the truth. If you would like to know what they are, email me back <br>
asking for them. I do not wish to try to further your understanding if my information
is falling on deaf ears.<br>
<b>My answer</b>: Dear Anna. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>In essence
Christianity is the faith in God according to the teaching of Jesus Christ as
delivered to us by the Gospels and expressed by the Christian creed. Many
Christians include Genesis, which is really a part of Jewish mythology, into
their faith, but many do not and you cannot really say that the one kind of
Christianity is better than the other. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><br>
Jesus Christ, the Gospel, and the Creed talks about God as Creator of the
Heavens and the Earth, but does not say that God made the world according to
Genesis. God may have created the world, including man, in billions of years by
means of evolution. Unless you insist on including Genesis into Christianity,
evolution and Christianity are not incompatible as long as you consider humans
as individuals responsible of their actions and receptive to the forgiveness of
sins. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Traditional
theory of evolution has a tendency to explain human as &#8216;just an animal&#8217;, which
behaves according to its inborn nature. And that is surely incompatible to
Christianity as it excludes man as a sinner. <br>
But that is not what I claim. On the contrary I propose that evolution can
explain the origin of man as the thinking, freely acting being, deliberated
from animal nature and therefore responsible to God and fellowman, receptive of
Salvation. And I cannot really see the difference to a Christian if man is made
of earth (Gen. 2:7) or made of a kind of primate? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>I wrote
that Genesis, not Creationism, contrasts to many established fact. That makes a
difference, as Genesis is the account of an event, which is claimed to have
taken place whereas Creationism is an alternative theory to explain how life,
including man, originated. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>You write,
&#8220;there are numerous faults that have been proven against the evolution theory&#8221;.
Surely not everything can be explained by the Darwinian theory of evolution,
but a demonstration of its faults and weakness does not confirm the truth of
Genesis or makes Creationism science. <br>
Whereas the evolution has an empirical foundation, Creationism is based only on
the belief in the literally truth of Genesis. That is why Creationism is not
science, but rather a theological discipline to defend the belief in man as
divinely created being against scientific theories. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
