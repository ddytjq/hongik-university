Our understanding of chromosomes and how information is stored		in them is a synthesis of three sciences. <A HREF="MGW1/MG111.html">Classical genetics</A> gave us the picture of genes aligned like beads on a string.		<A HREF="MGW1/MG113.html">Microscopy</A> revealed that these genetic chromosomes had a physical manifestation.		Most recetnly, <A HREF="MGW1/MG112.html">molecular biology</A> showed us that the information in chromosomes lies in the nucleotide		sequence of DNA (<A HREF="MGW1/MG11214.html">mostly</A>). The synthesis of these three sciences led to the ability to		<A HREF="MGW1/MG12.html">link</A> a DNA sequence to a specific gene and to a particular spot on		a specific chromosome.</P>		<P>Life's blueprint is passed from generation to generation. This		inheritance requires the faithful <A HREF="MGW1/MG13.html">copying of the DNA</A> of a cell. Each segment of the DNA must be copied just once.		The replicated DNA must be <A HREF="MGW1/MG136.html">distributed</A> to the two daughter cells so that each receive exactly one copy		of all the information.</P>		<P>The blueprint, the genome, is used to build and maintain cells,		tissues, organs and organisms. In the flow of information from		genome to organism, two steps require the copying of nucleotide		sequence information into a different form. The first step, the		copying of the DNA information into RNA, is designated <A HREF="MGW2/MG22.html">transcription</A> by analogy with medieval monks sitting in their cells copying,		letter by letter, old Latin manuscripts. The letters and words		in the new version are the same as in the old, but are written		with a different hand and thus have a slightly different appearance.		After transcription and before translation the RNA <A HREF="MGW2/MG23.html">transcripts are processed</A> to produce mature messenger RNA (mRNA). The second copying step,		in which amino acids are polymerized in response to the RNA information,		is called <A HREF="MGW2/MG24.html">translation</A>. Here, the monks take the Latin words and find English, German		or French equivalents. The product is in a different language,		in our case in the language of protein sequence. The products		of translation, <A HREF="MGW2/MG25.html">polypeptides, are also processed</A>, producing the <A HREF="#mature">mature proteins</A>. Each of the steps and the RNA and protein processing reactions		rely on <A HREF="MGW2/MG21.html">signal elements</A> within the informational molecule to signal the correct copying		or processing. Mature proteins contribute to phenotype in many		ways: structural (membranes, fibers); catalytic (synthesizing		other structural macromolecules, lipids, polysaccharides, etc.);		regulatory (turning on and off various reaction paths) in response		to environment or developmental plan. </P>		<P>Genomes are in a constant state of flux. There are many sources		of genome change. <A HREF="MGW3/MG31.html">Mutations</A> arise through damage to DNA that has not been repaired. Site-specific		recombination and transposition mediated <A HREF="MGW3/MG32.html">rearrangements</A> require recognition of a specific target sequence. DNA from one		organism can <A HREF="MGW3/MG33.html">invade</A> another organism's genome. Short or long sequences may under		certain conditions become <A HREF="MGW3/MG34.html">amplified</A> many fold. <A HREF="MGW3/MG35.html">Recombinational</A> exchange occurs between homologous DNA sequences. </P>		<P>The exciting progress in understanding chromosomes, how they specify		structure and function and how they change with time was made		possible by methods frequently used in molecular genetics. Specific		DNA sequences can be isolated <A HREF="MGW4/MG41.html">from organisms</A> by molecular cloning techniques. The isolated nucleic acids can		be <A HREF="MGW4/MG42.html">analyzed and manipulated</A> in a variety of ways. Finally, modified DNA can be put back <A HREF="MGW4/MG43.html">into organisms</A> to assess their function or to create modified organisms.</P>		<CENTER>			<P><A NAME="bottom"></A><A HREF="MG0.html">Last</A> | <A HREF="MG0.html">Preface</A> | <A HREF="#Facts">Top</A> | <A HREF="MGW1/MG1.html">Next</A><BR>			<BR>			</P>		</CENTER>		<P>		<HR>		</P>		<P>This is page 01 of <A HREF="MG01.html">Molecular Genetics</A> by <A HREF="http://opbs.okstate.edu/~melcher/UM.html">Ulrich Melcher</A>, &copy; 1997 <BR>		<BR>		<HR>		</P>		<ADDRESS>E-mail inquiries to <A HREF="mailto:umelcher@biochem.okstate.edu">U.
