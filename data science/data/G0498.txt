    <P>At the end of WWII in 1945, von Braun and hundreds of other
    German rocket experts surrendered to the Americans. They were
    sent to Fort Bliss, Texas, to develop rocket technology for U.S.
    Army research. While von Braun and his team continued to work
    on the V-2 rocket at Fort Bliss, von Braun dreamed about developing
    a rocket that could travel to other planets.</P>

    <P>With that thought in mind, he approached Ernst Stuhlinger,
    a member of the original &quot;Rocket Team&quot; that had emigrated
    to Fort Bliss. Von Braun asked Stuhlinger to review the research
    by von Braun's mentor, Oberth.</TD>

    <P>&quot;Professor Oberth has been right with so many of his
    early proposals,&quot; von Braun told Stuhlinger in 1947, &quot;I
    wouldn't be a bit surprised if we flew to Mars electrically.&quot;</P>

    <P>Stuhlinger immersed himself in electric propulsion theory.
    He found a copy of Oberth's book, &quot;Possibilities of Space
    Flight.&quot; Published in 1939, Oberth devoted a chapter to
    the various problems of electric propulsion systems, envisioning
    one design that might carry a 150-ton payload. In studying the
    origins of interest in electric propulsion, Stuhlinger learned
    that the American rocket pioneer, Dr. Robert Goddard, had examined
    the subject as early as 1906. Goddard had mentioned the possibility
    of accelerating electrically charged particles to very high velocities
    without the need for high temperatures.</P>

    <P>Studies in electric propulsion became more frequent following
    WWII, and in 1955 Stuhlinger presented a paper at the International
    Astronautical Congress in Vienna entitled, &quot;Possibilities
    of Electrical Space Ship Propulsion.&quot; During his presentation,
    Stuhlinger discussed a proposal made by von Braun two years earlier,
    to use chemical propulsion to send a spaceship to Mars. In von
    Braun's proposal, Stuhlinger noted that the ratio of take-off
    weight to final weight after propellant consumption was 25-to-1.
    Stuhlinger argued that lighter-weight electric propulsion systems
    would make such planetary trips more feasible than they were
    with chemical propulsion.</TD>

    principle behind the Deep Space 1 engine is much the same as
    what you experience when you pull hot socks out of the clothes
    dryer on a cold winter day. The socks push away from each other
    because they are electrostatically charged, and like charges
    repel. The challenge in electric space propulsion is to charge
    a fluid so its atoms can be expelled in one direction, and thus
    propel the spacecraft in the other direction.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The fuel used by Deep Space 1's
    ion engine is xenon, a gas that is more than 4 times heavier
    than air. When the ion engine is running, electrons are emitted
    from a hollow tube called a cathode. These electrons enter a
    magnet-ringed chamber, where they strike the xenon atoms. The
    impact of an electron on a xenon atom knocks away one of xenon's
    54 electrons. This results in a xenon atom with a positive charge,
    or what is known as an ion.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">At the rear of the chamber, a
    pair of metal grids is charged positively and negatively, respectively,
    with up to 1,280 volts of electricity. The force of this electric
    charge exerts a strong electrostatic pull on the xenon ions.
    The xenon ions shoot out the back of the engine at a speed of
    100,000 km/h (60,000 mph). At full throttle, the ion engine will
    consume 2,500 watts of electrical power, and put out 1/50th of
    a pound of thrust. That's far less than the thrust of even small
    chemical rockets. But an ion engine can run for months or even
    years, and it's up to 10 times more efficient.</FONT></TD>

    6, 1999</FONT></I></A><FONT SIZE="-1"> -- Scientists and engineers
    from Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and the Los Alamos National
    Laboratory have announced initial results from the novel PEPE
    instrument carried on the Deep Space 1 (DS1) spacecraft, part
    of NASA's New Millennium Program.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">According to Dr. David Young of SwRI, the
    principal investigator for the data analysis phase of the DS1
    mission and spokesman for the PEPE team, the new instrument observed
    charged xenon particles returning to the spacecraft from the
    1 ampere exhaust plume of the ion propulsion jet. At the same
    time, PEPE data have been used to place limits on electrical
    charging of the DS1 spacecraft. Taken together, these data suggest
    that the ion drive engine used to propel the spacecraft can indeed
    be used to power future scientific missions without interfering
    with the scientific payload. Before now, the use of such an engine
    in space had been unproved.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">PEPE incorporates a half-dozen new technologies
    that will make future space plasma instruments smaller and less
    expensive. Among these is a novel time-of- flight mass spectrometer
    that measures the composition of charged atomic particles (ions)
    coming from asteroid 1992 KD, the target of the DS1 mission.
    Other technologies include high performance power supplies operating
    at up to 15,000 volts but weighing just over 100 grams.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">PEPE also incorporates novel ion and electron
    optical systems that eliminate complex motors otherwise needed
    to steer a plasma instrument's line of sight. Young said that
    PEPE has achieved most of its technical goals: It weighs about
    25 percent of the mass and uses 50 percent of the power of a
    comparably performing SwRI instrument on NASA's Cassini spacecraft,
    while costing about 75 percent less. During January, the PEPE
    team took advantage of favorable alignment of the DS1 and Cassini
    spacecraft to measure the solar wind at both locations while
    separated by a distance of nearly 40,000,000 miles.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Young indicated that these initial PEPE measurements
    of the solar wind confirm that the instrument will be able to
    detect extremely low densities of ions and electrons during the
    planned DS1 encounters with the asteroid. For ions, the lowest
    detectable density is about 1 ion per 100 cubic centimeters,
    and for electrons it is ten times less. This means that PEPE
    has a good chance of providing the first plasma sensor detection
    of an asteroid and should give the first indication of the composition
    of asteroid surface materials that are constantly knocked off
    the asteroid surface by the solar wind.</FONT></P>

    Huntsville centered on ion engines. In April 1958, the Army Ballistic
    Missile Agency in Huntsville initiated its first electrical propulsion
    contract. Stuhlinger and his fellow scientists selected Electro-Optical
    Systems (EOS), Inc. to investigate ion thrust devices.</P>

    <P>James A. Downey, a NASA retiree who started with the Army
    rocket team, traced the Army's and NASA's development of electronic
    propulsion. He reported that the most imposing problem in the
    early development of ion engines was proving that injecting electrons
    could neutralize an ion beam. Continually spewing positively
    charged ions will leave a spacecraft with a negative charge so
    great that the ions are attracted back to the spacecraft. The
    solution is an electron gun that dumps the electrons into the
    ion stream, thus neutralizing both spacecraft and exhaust. But
    the beam's interaction with the walls of even a large vacuum
    chamber makes it very difficult to conduct meaningful beam neutralization
    experiments on Earth. According to Downey, these uncertainties
    led to considerations for flight testing electric engines.</P>

    <P>Downey said another challenge of electronic propulsion involved
    developing an efficient technique to produce ions. Working at
    NASA/Lewis, Harold Kaufman invented an electron-bombardment technique
    to ionize mercury atoms. At NASA/Marshall, they were developing
    a process where cesium atoms would become ionized upon contact
    with a hot tungsten or rhenium surface.</P>

    <P>Marshall's major development in electrical propulsion centered,
    however, on a 30-kilowatt ion engine development contract, initiated
    in September 1960 with Hughes Research Laboratory in Malibu,
    Calif. At first, Marshall directed Hughes to design a laboratory
    model of an ion engine. The 0.01 lb.-thrust model would be followed
    by the development of a 0.1 lb.-thrust engine. Marshall later
    modified the Hughes contract to include a flight test model ion
    engine, primarily to determine whether a beam neutralization
    problem existed in space.</TD>

    NASA awarded a contract to the Astro-Electronics Division of
    RCA to design and build a payload capsule for flight-testing
    electric propulsion engines. The program called for seven capsules,
    three for ground tests and four for actual flight tests. Each
    capsule was expected to carry two electric engines. The first
    was expected to carry one cesium-fueled ion-engine representing
    Stuhlinger's design with the Hughes engine. The second was expected
    to carry one mercury-fueled ion engine representing Kaufman's
    design with the Lewis engine. Plans called for the engines to
    operate from 1 to 2 kW of power.</P>

    <P>Hughes demonstrated an ion engine on Sept. 27, 1961, at its
    research laboratories in Malibu. Stuhlinger was among those on
    hand to greet the scientific and technical writers who attended
    the event. The group gathered to watch the engine actually operate
    in a vacuum chamber intended to duplicate the conditions the
    engine would encounter in space.</P>

    <P>Less than two months after the demonstration, however, NASA
    announced the consolidation of its nuclear-electric propulsion
    programs at Lewis. Nuclear-electric propulsion work at the Marshall
    Center's Research Projects Division, directed by Stuhlinger,
    moved from Huntsville to Cleveland. Stuhlinger, though, stayed
    at NASA/Marshall and worked on other projects.</P>

    space flight programs prompted the decision to employ Stuhlinger's

    <P>Although responsibility for electric propulsion research has
    moved from Marshall to Lewis, Stuhlinger still continues to promote
    the promises of electric propulsion.</P>

    <P>&quot;Everyone who ever worked on electric propulsion during
    these past 50 years is now following the newest ion propulsion
    project, Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Deep Space 1 mission&#133;with
    greatest interest, and with fervent wishes for success,&quot;
    Stuhlinger says.</TD>
