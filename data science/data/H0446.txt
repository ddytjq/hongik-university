<h2></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Piltdown man is one of the most famous frauds in the history of science.
In 1912 <a href="#dawson">Charles Dawson</a>
discovered the first of two skulls found in the Piltdown
quarry in Sussex, England, skulls of an apparently primitive hominid, an ancestor
of man.  Piltdown man, or <i>Eoanthropus dawsoni</i> to use his scientific name,
was a sensation.  He was the expected "missing link" a mixture of human and ape
with the noble brow of <i>Homo sapiens</i> and a primitive jaw.  Best of all, he
was British!
</p>
<p>
As the years went by and new finds of ancient hominids were made, Piltdown man became
an anomaly that didn't fit in, a creature without a place in the human family tree.
Finally, in 1953, the truth came out.  Piltdown man was a hoax, the most ancient of
people who never were.  This is his story.
</p>
<p>
My principal source for the original version of this page is Ronald Millar's
<a href="#millar"><i>The Piltdown Men</i></a>.
This book is an account of the entire Piltdown affair from beginning to end, including not
merely the circumstances but the general background of the paleontology and evolutionary
theory with respect to human ancestry during the period 1850-1950.
A number of important books have also been written on the hoax,
e.g. works by Spencer, Weiner, Blinderman, and Walsh, and have been
valuable resources.

</blockquote> 

<p>
In 1856 the first Neanderthal fossil discovery was made and the hunt was on
to find fossil remains of human ancestors.  In the next half century finds
were made in continental Europe and in Asia but not in Britain.
Finally, in 1912, the sun rose on British paleontology -- fossil remains
of an ancient pleistocene hominid were found in the Piltdown quarries in
Sussex.  In the period 1912 to 1915 the Piltdown quarries yielded two
skulls, a canine tooth, and a mandible of <i>Eoanthropus</i>,
a tool carved from an elephant tusk, and fossil teeth from a
number of pleistocene animals.
<p> 
<p>
There is a certain vagueness about some of the critical events.
<a href="#dawson">Dawson</a> contacted <a href="#woodward">Woodward</a>
about the first two skull fragments which were supposedly found by
workman "some years prior".  Exactly when is unknown.  Similarly, the
discovery of Piltdown II is shrouded in mystery.  Supposedly Dawson
and an anonymous friend make the discovery 1915; however the friend and
the location of the find are unknown.
</p>
<p>
The reaction to the finds was mixed.  On the whole the British paleontologists were
enthusiastic;
the French and American paleontologists tended to be skeptical, some objected
quite vociferously.  The objectors held that the jawbone and the skull
were obviously from two different animals and that their discovery together was simply
an accident of placement.  In the period 1912-1917 there was a great deal of skepticism.
The report in 1917 of the discovery of Piltdown II converted many of the skeptics;
one accident of placement was plausible -- two were not.
</p>
<p>
It should be remembered that, at the time of Piltdown finds, there were very few early
hominid fossils; Homo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens were clearly fairly late.  It was
expected that there was a "missing link" between ape and man.  It was an open question
as to what that missing link would look like.  Piltdown man had the expected mix of
features, which lent it plausibility as a human precursor.
</p>
<p>
This plausibility did not hold up.  During the next two decades there were a number
of finds of ancient hominids and near hominids, e.g. <a href="#dart">Dart's</a> discovery
of <i>Australopithecus</i>, the Peking man discoveries, and other <i>Homo erectus</i> and
australopithecine finds.  Piltdown man did not fit in with the new discoveries.
None the less, Sir Arthur Keith (a major defender of Piltdown man)
<a href="#keith1931">wrote</a> in 1931:
</p>
<blockquote>
It is therefore
 possible that Piltdown man does represent the early pleistocene ancestor
 of the modern type of man, He may well be the ancestor we have been in 
 search of during all these past years. I am therefore inclined to make the
 Piltdown type spring from the main ancestral stem of modern humanity...
</blockquote>
<p>
In the period 1930-1950 Piltdown man was increasingly marginalized and by 1950 
was, by and large, simply ignored.  It was carried
in the books as a fossil hominid.  From time to time it was puzzled over and then
dismissed again.  The American Museum of Natural History quietly classified it as a
mixture of ape and man fossils.  Over the years it had become an anomaly; some prominent
authors did not even bother to list it.

In <i>Bones of Contention</I> Roger Lewin quotes  Sherwood Washburn as
saying
</p><blockquote>
  "I remember writing a paper on human evolution in 1944, and I simply
  left Piltdown out.  You could make sense of human evolution if you
  didn't try to put Piltdown into it."
</blockquote>

<p>
Finally, in 1953, the roof fell in.  Piltdown
man was not an ancestor; it was not a case of erroneous interpretation; it was a case
of outright deliberate fraud.

<h2></a>Forging Fossils</h2>

<p>
From the chronology and the later reconstruction of events it is fairly clear that
there never were any significant fossils at the Piltdown quarry.  It was salted from time
to time with fossils to be found.  Once the hoax was exposed, Sir Kenneth Oakley
went on to apply more advanced tests to find where the bones had come from and how
old they were.  His main findings were:
</p>
<blockquote>
Piltdown I skull: Medieval, human, ~620 years old.<br>
Piltdown II skull: Same source as Piltdown I skull.<br>
Piltdown I jawbone: Orangutan jaw, ~500 years old, probably from Sarawak.<br>
Elephant molar:  Genuine fossil, probably from Tunisia.<br>
Hippopotamus tooth:  Genuine fossil, probably from Malta or Sicily.<br>
Canine tooth:  Pleistocene chimpanzee fossil.
</blockquote>

<p>
Originally it had been believed that one skull had been used; later, more
precise dating established in 1989 that two different skulls had been used,
one for each of the two skull "finds".  The skulls were unusually thick; a
condition that is quite rare in the general population but is common
among the Ona indian tribe in Patagonia.
The jawbone was not definitely established as being that of an orangutan
until 1982.  <a href="/faqs/piltdown/drawhorn.html">Drawhorn's</a> paper summarizes all
that is currently known about the provenance of the bones that were used.
</p>


<p>
Not only were the bones gathered from a variety of sources, they were given a
thorough going treatment to make them appear to be genuinely ancient.
A solution containing iron was used to stain the bones; fossil
bones deposited in gravel pick up iron and manganese. [It is unclear whether
the solution also contained manganese: Millar mentions that manganese was
present; Hall, who did the tests for manganese, says that it was not.]
Before staining the bones (except for the jawbone) were treated with
Chromic acid to convert the bone apatite (mineral component) to gypsum
to facilitate the intake of the iron and manganese (?) solution used
to stain the bones.
The skull may have also been boiled in an iron sulphate solution.
The canine tooth was painted after staining, probably with Van Dyke brown.
The jaw bone molars were filed to fit.  The
connection where the jawbone would meet the rest of the skull was carefully broken
so that there would be no evidence of lack of fit.  The canine tooth was filed to
show wear (and was patched with chewing gum).  It was filled with sand as it might
have been if it had been in the Ouse river bed.

<h2></a>How the hoax was exposed</h2>
<p>
With <a href="#uncritically">few exceptions</a>
nobody suggested that the finds were a hoax until the very end.  
The beginning of the end came when a new dating technique, the fluorine absorption
test, became available.
The Piltdown fossils were dated with this test in 1949; the tests
established that the fossils were relatively modern.  Even so, they were still
accepted as genuine.  For example, in Nature,
1950, p 165, <i>New Evidence on the Antiquity of Piltdown Man</i> Oakley wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
The results of the fluorine test have considerably increased the probability that the
[Piltdown] mandible and cranium represent the same creature.  The relatively late date
indicated by the summary of evidence suggests moreover that Piltdown man, far from being
an early primitive type, may have been a late specialized hominid which evolved in
comparative isolation.  In this case the peculiarities of the mandible and the excessive
thickness of the cranium might well be interpreted as secondary or gerontic developments.
</blockquote>
<p>
In 1925 <a href="#edmonds">Edmonds</a> had pointed out that Dawson was in error in his
geological dating of the Piltdown gravels: they were younger than Dawson had assumed.
In 1951 he published an article pointing out that there was no plausible source for the
Piltdown animal fossils.  Millar (p203) writes:
</p>
<blockquote>
The older group of Piltdown animals, he said, were alleged to have been washed from a
Pliocene land deposit in the Weald.  Edmonds thought there must be some misunderstanding.
There was no Pliocene land deposit in the entire Weald which could have produced them.
the only local Pliocene beds were marine in origin and lay above the five-hundred foot
contour line.
</blockquote>
<p>
In July 1953 an international congress of paleontologists, under the auspices of the
Wenner-Gren Foundation, was held in London.  The world's fossil men were put up, admired
and set down again.  But, according to <a href="#weiner">Dr. J.S. Weiner</a>,
Piltdown man got barely a mention.
He did not fit in.  He was a piece of the jig-saw puzzle; the right colour but the wrong
shape.
It was at the congress that the possibility of fraud dawned on Weiner.  Once the possibility
had raised it was easy to establish that the finds
were a fraud.  Millar writes:
</p>
<blockquote>
The original Piltdown teeth were produced and examined by the three
scientists.  The evidence of fake could seen immediately.  The first
and second molars were worn to the same degree; the inner margins of
the lower teeth were more worn than the outer -- the 'wear' was the
wrong way round; the edges of the teeth were sharp and unbevelled; the
exposed areas of dentine were free of shallow cavities and flush with
the surrounding enamel; the biting surface of the two molars did not
form a uniform surface, the planes were out of alignment.  That the
teeth might have been misplaced after the death of Piltdown man was
considered but an X-ray showed the lower contact surfaces of the roots
were correctly positioned.  This X-ray also revealed that contrary to
the 1916 radiograph the roots were unnaturally similar in length and
disposition.
</blockquote><blockquote>
The molar surface were examined under a microscope.  They were scarred
by criss-cross scratches suggesting the use of an abrasive.  'The
evidences of artificial abrasion immediately sprang to the eye' wrote
Le Gros Clark. 'Indeed so obvious did they [the scratches] seem it may
well be asked -- how was it that they had escaped notice before?'  He
answered his question with a beautiful simplicity.  'They had never
been looked for...nobody previously had examined the Piltdown jaw with
the idea of a possible forgery in mind, a deliberate fabrication.'
</blockquote>

<p>
Why then was the fraud so successful?  Briefly, (a) the team finding the specimans
(Dawson, Woodward, Teilhard) had excellent credentials, (b) incompetence on the part
of the British Paleontological community, (c) the relatively primitive analytical tools
available circa 1920, (d) skill of the forgery, (e) it matched what was
expected from theory, and (f) as Millar remarks,
the hoax led a charmed life.
</p>
<h3>Credentials</h3>
<p>
As a matter of practice, a fraud or
hoax is much more likely to succeed if it appears to be validated by an authority.  In
general, one does not expect a professional in a field to concoct a hoax.  Experience
teaches that this expectation is not always met.
</p>
<h3>Incompetence</h3>
<p>
Although the team had excellent credentials none was truly competent in dealing with
hominid fossils; their expertise lay elsewhere.  The British museum people, Woodward
and Pycraft, made numerous errors of reconstruction and interpretation.  The only
expert in the expanded team, Grafton Eliot Smith, was strangely silent about some of
the errors.
</p>
<h3>Primitive analytical tools</h3>
<p>
It is hard for us today to fully grasp how primitive the analytical tools available to the
paleontologists of that time were.  Chemical tests and dating techniques taken for granted
today were not available.  The analysis of the details of tooth wear was less worked out.
The simple knowledge of geology was much less detailed.  The importance of careful establishment
of the provenance of fossils was not appreciated.  In short, the paleontologists of 1915
were an easier lot to fool.
</p>
<h3>Skill of the forgery</h3>
<p>
At the time there were virtually no hominid
fossils finds except for some of the early Neanderthal finds.  The reconstruction of
human evolution was very much an open question.  The Piltdown specimens fit one of the
leading speculations.  The forger knew what anatomical and paleontological tests the
specimens would be given.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Meeting Theoretical Expectations</h3>
<p>
As <a href="#hammond">Hammond</a> points out, a key reason why the hoax
succeeded was because it fit in very well with the theories of the time.
Boule had recently (erroneously) discredited Neanderthal man as being
close to the main hominid line (1908-1912).
Elliot Smith felt that the large brain case would have developed first.
Sollas did not, but did strongly support mosaic evolution, i.e., features
appearing in patches rather in a smooth transition.  It was his opinion
that human dentition developed before the human jaw.  Woodward and others
believed that eoliths (supposed very early stone tools) indicated the
presence of an early, intelligent hominid in England.  Piltdown man,
with his large braincase, his simian jaw, and his near human dentition
fit the theoretical picture.
</p>
<h3>Charmed Life</h3>
<P>
The hoax had a charmed life.  Features that might have exposed
the hoax didn't get caught because of small errors in procedure.
For example,
the hoax would have been exposed immediately had
 a test of the jaw for organic matter been made. Tests
 were made on the cranial fragments, but these were sufficiently  
 well mineralized to pass.
</p>
<p>
The X-rays taken were of poor quality, even for the time.
The dentist Lyne
pointed out the incongruity between the heavy wear on the canine and
its large pulp cavity, a sign of youth.
This was interpreted as secondary dentine formation,
an explanation that "worked" because of the poor quality
of the X-rays.
</p>
<p>
The erroneous wear pattern on the molars, which was obvious
when Weiner looked at the casts, was never noticed.  Nor were
they carefully examined under a microscope -- the abrasion
marks would have been seen.

<h2></a>Who perpetrated the hoax?</h2>
<a href="#perplist">Click here to go directly to the perpetrator list</a>

<p>
Who did it?  Who perpetrated the hoax?  When the hoax was exposed
nobody knew who the perpetrator was.  No one confessed to the deed.
For forty odd years people have speculated about the identity of the
culprit; over time an impressive list of suspects has accumulated.
The case against each suspect has been circumstantial, a constellation
of suspicious behaviour, of possible motives, and of opportunity.  In
this section we present summaries of the arguments against the principal
candidates.
</p>
<p>
A comprehensive listing of the accusations, when they were made, who
made them, and who the accused were can be found in Tom Turrittin's
<a href="/faqs/piltdown/piltref.html">Piltdown man overview</a>; it includes details
not given here including the particulars of 30 separate books or papers
making accusations.  

<p>
When the hoax was first exposed Dawson, Teilhard, and Woodward were
the obvious suspects; they had made the major finds. In 1953 Weiner
fingered Dawson as the culprit. <a href="#gould">Stephen Jay Gould</a>
argued that Teilhard and Dawson were the culprits.  
Woodward generally escaped suspicion; however Drawhorn made a strong
case against him in 1994.
<a href="#smith">Grafton Elliot Smith</a> and 
<a href="#keith">Sir Arthur Keith</a> were prominent
scientists that played key roles in the discovery.
Millar argued that Smith was the culprit; 
Spencer argued that it was a conspiracy between Dawson and Keith.
Other candidates that have been mentioned over the years include
<a href="#doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, the geologist
<a href="#sollas">W. J. Sollas</a>, and the paleontologist
<a href="#hinton">Martin Hinton</a>.
This is by no means the end of the list; other people accused include
<a href="#hargreaves">Hargreaves</a>, <a href="#abbot">Abbot</a>,
<a href="#barlow">Barlow</a>, and <a href="#butterfield">Butterfield</a>.
</p>
<p>
This fraud is quite unique.  Most scientific frauds and hoaxes fall into a few categories.
There are student japes, students conconcting evidence to fit a superior's theories.
There are confirming evidence frauds, in which a researcher fabricates findings that
they believe should be true.  There are outright frauds for money, fossils that are
fabricated for gullible collectors.  There are rare cases of fabrication for reputation,
done in the knowledge that the results will not be checked.  And, upon occasion, there
are frauds concocted simply as an expression of a perverse sense of humor.
</p>
<p>
The Piltdown hoax does not seem to fit any of these categories well.  This was not an
ordinary hoax; it was a systematic campaign over the years to establish the existence of
Piltdown man.  The early skull fragments were created in advance and salted with the
foreknowledge that more extensive finds would be planted later. The
hoaxer had to have good reason to believe that the salted fossils would be found.
</p>

<p>
  One of the
 critical factors in any theory is to account for the fact that the
 perpetrator had to be confident that the salted fossils would be found.
 That suggests that either Dawson, Teilhard, or Woodward was involved since
 they alone made the initial finds.  At first sight it would seem that
 Dawson must have been guilty since he made the initial find of the first
 two skull fragments.  However he didn't!  They were made by anonymous
 workmen.  The "find" could have been arranged for a handful of coins.
 As Vere pointed out, the labourer Hargreaves, employed to do most of the
 digging, was also present at the site.
</p>
<p>
Another critical factor to be accounted for is access to the specimens
that were used in the hoax.  Likewise the question of skill and knowledge
required for the hoax must be taken into account.
<p>
Below are summaries of the cases to be made against the various possible
perpetrators.  At the moment this section is very much under construction!

<h3>Was Abbot the forger?</h3>
<p>
Lewis Abbot, owner of a Hastings jewelry shop, friend of Dawson,
and widely respected for his knowledge of the geology of southern
England.
He was considered as a possibility by Weiner.  Blinderman
make a major accusation against Abbot, based on an assessment of
personality, requisite knowledge, and probable access to the needed
bones.  The case, however, lacked any definite substance.  Abbot
has also been mentioned as a possible co-conspirator in a number
of accusations.
</p>

<a name="who_barlow"></a>
<a href="#perplist">Back to perpetrator list</a>
<h3>Was Barlow the forger?</h3>
<p>
Barlow was accused of being a co-conspirator with Dawson
by Caroline Grigson, the curator of the Ontodontological
Museum.  The accusation has not been taken seriously.
</p>

<a name="who_butterfield"></a>
<a href="#perplist">Back to perpetrator list</a>
<h3>Was Butterfield the forger?</h3>
<p>
Butterfield, the curator at the Hastings museum, was
accused by van Esbroeck of being the forger with Hargreaves
planting the forged fossils.  The proposed motive is revenge
over Dawson's appropriation of some dinosaur fossils.  There
is no substantive evidence for this charge.
</p>

<a name="who_dawson"></a>
<a href="#perplist">Back to perpetrator list</a>
<h3>Was Dawson the sole forger?</h3>
<p>
<a href="#dawson">Dawson</a>
is the obvious suspect.  He made the initial find of the two skull
fragments and the Piltdown II find.  In
both of these critical discoveries there is no confirmation by another party.
He was the one who made the Piltdown quarry a special object of search.
Indeed he is such an obvious suspect (Weiner seems to have taken it for
granted that Dawson was the forger) that the question is -- why consider
any one besides Dawson?  Millar (p 226-7) argues against Dawson as the culprit as
follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
One of my main objections to the assumption that Dawson is inevitably the
culprit is that  as the discoverer he was wide open to suspicion.  He is too
obvious a culprit... If the bogus fossil excaped detection by his friends
at the museum he surely could not have expected that it would withstand
scientific enquiry forever.  I find it impossible to believe that Dawson
would pit his meagre knowledge of anatomy (if it is accepted that he had
any at all) against that of any skilled human anatomist... The threat of
exposure would be perpetual.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
As it was Piltdown man had a charmed life.  Because of the poor quality of
the original X-ray photographs the bogus jaw remained undetected at the
outset.  Le Gros Clark has emphasized that the forger's crude workmanship
on the teeth was there for all to see if only someone had looked for it.
</blockquote>
<p>
Millar's argument sounds plausible but it doesn't stand up well.  Dawson
was a man of many interests, both antiquarian and paleontological, and
had numerous knowledgeable friends and acquaintances.  The requisite
knowledge could readily have been acquired.  The argument that he wouldn't
have dared is suspect; there is considerable evidence that Dawson had been
involved in a number of forgeries and plagarisms; some of which only came
to light after Millar wrote.  <a href="#walsh">Walsh</a> discusses a number
of incidents:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The Beauport Statuette</li>
<li>The Blackmore flint weapon</li>
<li>The Bexhill boat</li>
<li>The Uckfield horseshoe</li>
<li>The Hastings clockface</li>
<li>The Dene Holes plagarism</li>
<li>The Iron Industry in Old Sussex plagarism</li>
<li>The Old Sussex Glass plagarism</li>
<li>The Hastings Castle plagarism</li>
<li>The Pevensey Brick</li>
</ul>
<p>
A critical point, which Walsh emphasizes, was the discovery of the
jawbone by Dawson.  Most of the other bones were found in spill, dug
up gravel which was searched later after having been dug up.  The
jawbone, however, was found in situ by Dawson.  He struck a blow into
the hardpacked gravel and the jawbone popped out (this was reported by
Woodward).  It would have been very difficult to bury the jawbone in
the hardpacked gravel convincingly; however no one except Dawson actually
observed the purported undisturbed location of the jawbone before it
was found. 
</p>
<p>
In retrospect it is hard to see how Dawson could not have been involved.
Walsh argues strongly that Dawson and Dawson alone was the culprit,
that he had both the necessary knowledge and the requisite character,
and that his participation was physically necessary.  Indeed, one might
ask why someone proposing to undertake such a fraud would risk having
a co-conspirator.  However it happens often enough that people of similar
inclinations recognize each other.

<a href="#perplist">Back to perpetrator list</a>
<h3>Were Dawson and Keith conspirators?</h3>
<p>
<i>
The following is an excerpt taken from a summary published by Robert Parson
in the talk.origins newsgroup.
</i>
<p>
<p>
In the late 1970's, Ian Langham, an Australian historian of science,
began a comprehensive reevaluation of the events surrounding the
forgery. Langham was initially attracted to Ronald Millar's hypothesis
that the forger was Grafton Elliot Smith; however he later dropped this
hypothesis and settled instead upon Sir Arthur Keith. Langham died
suddenly in 1984, before revealing his conclusions, and Frank Spencer,
of the Department of Anthropology at Queens College of the City
University of New York, was appointed to complete Langham's research. 
Spencer published his and Langham's conclusions in <i>Piltdown: A
Scientific Forgery</i>.
</p>
<p>
The centerpiece of the Langham-Spencer argument is an anonymous article
that appeared in the British Medical Journal on 21 December 1912, three
days after the formal announcement of the discovery of Piltdown Man at a
Geological Society meeting. This article appears superficially to be a
mere summary of the meeting, but in fact it contains information
(relating to the exact location of the site and to the history of the
discovery) that at that time was known only by the people actually
involved in the digging.  Arthur Smith Woodward found this puzzling and
wondered who the author had been and how he had learned about these
details, but never found out.  70 years later Ian Langham discovered
that the author was Arthur Keith.  Moreover, Keith's diary showed that
he had written the article <i>three days before the meeting actually took
place.</i> Keith was not a part of Woodward's inner circle at this time,
and he had not been consulted by Woodward on the discovery; indeed, he
had only been allowed to view the specimens two weeks before the
official announcement, even though the existence of the find (though not
the details) had been an open secret for many weeks beforehand.
</p>
<p>
This discovery (and similar, more ambiguous documents) suggested to
Langham a connection between Dawson and Keith. Keith claimed to have met
Dawson for the first time in January 1913, but Langham found evidence
that they had met at least three times during 1911-1912. He also noticed
that Keith had destroyed all of his correspondence with Dawson.  Langham
proposed that Dawson began to prepare the hoax sometime between 1905 and
1910. In mid-1911 Keith was brought into it, and during the period
1911-12 Keith prepared the various specimens, Dawson planted them, and
Dawson's team subsequently dug them up.
</p>
<p>
The case against Keith is discussed in detail by Walsh.  According to
his analysis the circumstantial evidence all has a natural and innocent
explanation.
</p>

<a name="who_doyle"></a>
<a href="#perplist">Back to perpetrator list</a>
<h3>Was Arthur Conan Doyle the perpetrator?</h3>
<p>
The argument for Doyle was made in an article in Science in 1983
by the anthropologist John Winslow.  The Spring 1996 issue of
<i>Pacific Discovery</i> has an 
excellent article by Robert Anderson on
the Doyle theory.  Doyle was a neighbour of Dawson,
was an amateur bone hunter, and participated briefly in the digs.
The principal arguments for Doyle as the culprit are circumstantial
and literary; it has been argued that <i>The Lost World</i> describes
the execution of the hoax in veiled terms.  Anderson argues that the
exact location of the planted fossils is spelled out in
<i>The Lost World</i> as a puzzle.  
The essential weakness of the
case against Doyle is that it would not have been possible for him
to have planted the bones with any expectation that they would have
been found.  Walsh analyzes the case against Doyle in detail and
finds it wanting.
</p>
<p>
The principal proponent of the Doyle theory,Richard Milner who is
a historian of science from the American Museum of Natural History,
still holds Doyle was responsible.  In a debate staged by the
Linnaean Society in March 1997 as part of National Science Week
he argued the case for Arthur Conan Doyle and against the case for
Hinton.
<p>
Sir Arthur was a zealous spiritualist, embittered by the
exposure and prosecution of Henry Slade, one of his favourite
psychics.  It is suggested that Doyle sought to discredit the
scientific establishment by faking evidence of something they
wanted to believe in thereby showing scientists knew less than
they thought they did.
</p>

<a name="who_hargreaves"></a>
<a href="#perplist">Back to perpetrator list</a>
<h3>Was Hargreaves involved?</h3>
<p>
Hargreaves, the laborer who did most of the digging at the Piltdown
site, was accused by Vere.  There is no direct evidence against him.
However, unlike many others, he had real opportunity to plant the
fossils.  If Dawson and Woodward were not involved he almost must
have been involved.
</p>
<a name="who_hinton"></a>
<a href="#perplist">Back to perpetrator list</a>
<h3>Was Martin Hinton the perpetrator?</h3>
<p>

The May 23, 1996 edition of <i>Nature</i> presents the new case
and a smoking gun (?) against Martin A. C. Hinton, a curator of zoology
at the museum at the time of the fraud.  There are two finds
of bones stained and carved in the manner of the Piltdown fossils,
a canvas travelling trunk marked with Hinton's initials and glass
tubes from Hinton's estate (Hinton died in 1961) which
contained human teeth stained in various ways.
</p>
<p>
The trunk was found in the mid-1970s, when contractors were clearing
loft space in the British Museum.  
The trunk contained hundreds of vials of
rodent dissections (Hinton was a rodent specialist) and a collection of
carved and stained pieces of fossil hippopotamus and elephant teeth,
as well as assorted bones, that looked as if they belonged in the
Piltdown collection.
</p>
<p>
The Nature article claimed that the
teeth from the the estate, the contents of the trunk, and the
Piltdown remains were stained with the same chemical recipe, a mixture
of iron, managanese and chromium.  The recipe appears to have been
invented by Hinton and is based on a  knowledge of post-depositional
processes affecting fossils in gravel.  Hinton had published a paper
in 1899 showing that fossils in river gravels would be impregnated with
oxides of iron and manganese, staining them a characteristic
chocolate- brown colour.
</p>
<p>
The motive may have revenge in a quarrel about money or it may simply have
been that Woodward was irritatingly stuffy.  Hinton was fond of and was famed
for his elaborate practical jokes.  Hinton was a member of a circle of
Sussex-based geologist colleagues and was an expert on the Weald geology.
In 1954, shortly after the exposure Hinton wrote a revealing letter
to Gavin de Beer
director of the British Museum (Natural History):
</p>
<blockquote>
The temptation to invent such a 'discovery' of an ape-like man
associated with late Pliocene Mammals in a Wealden gravel might well
have proved irresistable to some unbalanced member of old Ben
Harrison's circe at Ightham. He and his friends (of whom I was one) were
always talking of the possibility of finding a late Pliocene deposit in
the weald.
</blockquote>
<p>
Andrew Currant, a researcher at the museum and
Brian Gardiner, professor of palaeontology at King's College, London,
made the investigations into the Hinton evidence.
Gardiner presented the
case against Hinton in his presidential address to the
Linnean Society in London on May 24, 1996.
</p>
<p>
The case against Hinton is not what it seems.  The motive suggested
by Gardiner (a quarrel about money) does not work because of timing;
the incident in question happened in 1911; the first finds were in
1908.  More importantly the chemical analyses do not match.  The
Hinton samples include Manganese; the Piltdown specimens do not.
The Hinton samples do not contain gypsum (produced from the organic
material); the Piltdown specimens do. [Drawhorn, correspondence].
Walsh notes that there were legitimate reasons for Hinton to have
this material, including doing tests for Oakley.
In any event it would have been physically impossible for Hinton
to have been the sole hoaxer because he did not have the requisite
access to the site in the 1912-1914 period.
</p>
<a name="who_hinton_etal"></a>
<a href="#perplist">Back to perpetrator list</a>
<h3>Was it Hinton and others?</h3>
<p>
Although the physical evidence is ambiguous, Hinton's name pops up
under a variety of odd circumstances and it seems likely that he knew
more that he should have, either by virtue of being a co-conspirator
or by virtue of special knowledge not publicly admitted.
</p>
<p>
In 1981 <a href="#matthews">L. Harrison Matthews</a> wrote a series of
articles in the <a href="#matthews_in_new_scientist"><i>New Scientist</i></a>
on the Piltdown hoax.  In these article he suggested 
that Hinton believed the finds to be a
hoax and that Hinton and Teilhard
manufactured and planted ridiculous forgeries to expose the hoax.
In particular the Elephant bone tool was a crude cricket
bat, appropriate for "the earliest Englishman".  
This theory was repeated in 1982 in
<a href="#betrayers"><i>Betrayers of the Truth</i></a> by Broad and Wade,
and in 1996 in <i>The Common but Less Frequent Loon and Other Essays</i> by
Keith S. Thomson.
</p>
<p>
L. Harrison Matthews described informal dinner conversations in the period 
1945-51 during which Hinton implied that "Piltdown was not a subject to 
be taken seriously" from which Matthews surmised that Hinton "knew more 
about the hoax and the museum's part in it than he ever admitted". Other 
evidence referred to by Matthews included Hinton's correspondence after 
the hoax was exposed and subsequent conversations in which Hinton 
obliquely included himself in a small list of suspects. Matthews was 
sufficiently confident about Hinton's involvement that he was the first 
to suggest the oft-repeated claim that the first finds were due to Dawson 
and that in response, Hinton manufactured and planted ridiculous  
forgeries to expose the hoax.  This is a relatively honorable role for 
Hinton in comparison with sole hoaxer. It is clear that Matthews respected 
Hinton, with whom he shared many wide-ranging and interesting 
conversations during Hinton's retirement. It is likely that Matthews was 
unable to conceive of his friend being the initiator and solely 
responsible for the fraud.
</p>

<a name="who_smith"></a>
<a href="#perplist">Back to perpetrator list</a>
<h3>Was Grafton Elliot Smith the perpetrator?</h3>
<p>
Millar argues that <a href="#smith">Smith</a>
was the culprit.  Smith was an expert anatomist,
and a paleontologist with ready access to a wide variety of fossils.  
He was suspiciously quiet
when Woodward messed up the construction of the Piltdown I skull.  He
"failed to recognize" that the cranial bones of Piltdown II belonged
to Piltdown I whereas Hrdlicka recognized that the Piltdown II molar
came from Piltdown I after a brief examination.  Millar notes:
</p>
<blockquote>
I have examined all of Smith's writings on the subject with care and in
not one instance does he fail to state carefully that his findings were
based on the examination of a <i>plaster cast</i> of the skull.
</blockquote>
<p>
It is quite unlikely that Smith had not examined the actual skull fragments.
Smith was in Nubia during most of the discoveries; however he came to
England at convenient points.  Smith had the right kind of personality.
When Millar discussed the possibility of Smith with Oakley, Oakley was
not surprised.  There is, however, no direct evidence against Smith.
As with other "outsider" theories it was physically impossible for
Smith to have been the sole hoaxer.
</p>

<a name="who_sollas"></a>
<a href="#perplist">Back to perpetrator list</a>
<h3>Was W. J. Sollas the perpetrator?</h3>
<p>
<a href="#sollas">W. J. Sollas</a>
was a  Professor of Geology at Oxford and a bitter enemy of
 Woodward. He was accused  in 1978 by his successor in the Oxford chair, J. A. Douglas,
 in a posthumously released tape recording.  The essential difficulty with
this theory is to explain how Sollas (or another outsider) could have salted the Piltdown
site and be sure the fake fossils would be found.
One also wonders why, if Sollas were the perpetrator, he did not expose the
hoax and thereby damaging Woodward's reputation.  
This could have been done behind the scenes easily enough by asking the
right questions.  
</p>


<a name="who_teilhard"></a>
<a href="#perplist">Back to perpetrator list</a>
<h3>Was Teilhard de Chardin the perpetrator?</h3>
<p>
In an essay reprinted in <a href="#pandas_thumb"><i>The Panda's Thumb</i></a>,
<a href="#gould">Stephen Jay Gould</a> argues the case for a conspiracy by
<a href="#teilhard">Teilhard de Chardin</a> and <a href="#dawson">Dawson</a>.
The case is circumstantial.
The suggested motive is a student jape (Teilhard was quite young at the
time.)  It was supposed that Teilhard did not have the opportunity; however
Gould shows that this was not  necessarily so.  Much of Gould's case rests on
ambiguous wording in Teilhard's correspondence.  Certainly Teilhard is a plausible
candidate for the mysterious friend who helped discover Piltdown II.
Gould argues that they had intended to blow the
gaffe shortly after the initial finds but that they were prevented from doing
so by WW I.  By 1918 things had gotten out of hand to the point where the hoax
could no longer be owned up to.
</p>
<p>
I do not think that Gould's assessment of motive stands up well.  It is plausible
that Teilhard might have concocted a hoax; that is common for frisky students.
However this fraud was planned and prepared years in advance and was executed
over an extended period of time; the nature of the execution of the fraud goes
well beyond the student jape.  
</p>
<p>
The case against Teilhard is considered in detail by Walsh.  He argues fairly
convincingly that many of the circumstances stressed by Gould have natural
and plausible explanations.
</p>
<p>
Teilhard was also accused of being involved by
<a href="#matthews">L. Harrison Matthews</a>
who claimed that Teilhard planted the fossil canine tooth in 
collaboration with Martin A.C. Hinton, with Teilhard subsequently 
"discovering" the tooth. The evidence for this collaboration is that 
Hinton told his friend Richard Savage that Hinton and Teilhard had 
visited the site together early in 1913. Matthews commented that Teilhard 
never mentioned this visit, and subsequent developments have damaged 
Hinton's credibility regarding these clues.
</p>
<a name="who_woodward"></a>
<a href="#perplist">Back to perpetrator list</a>
<h3>Was Woodward the perpetrator?</h3>
<p>
Woodward seems to have escaped serious consideration, primarily because he was
very much a "straight arrow".  
However there is a strong case to be made against Woodward as a co-conspirator
with Dawson.  The provenance of many of bones used in the construction of
the Piltdown specimens has been established; some were not at all readily
available.  Woodward, and apparently only Woodward, had professional access
to all of them.  The main focus of <a href="/faqs/piltdown/drawhorn.html">Drawhorn's</a>
paper is a consideration of this question of the origin of the specimens
and who could have provided them.
</p><p>
Woodward had strong motives.  He benefitted directly as co-discoverer of
a monumental find.  During the period in question he was engaged in an
ardent campaign for the position of Director of the BMNH, a campaign in
which his tactics were distinctly not "straight-arrowish".  The finds
directly confirmed the orthogenetic theories that he was advocating.
</p><p>
Woodward's participation would explain many of the seemingly fortunate
circumstances that allowed the hoax to survive.  For example, the hoax
would have failed immediately if the jawbone had been tested for organic
material; it never was.  Dawson, as a single hoaxer, could have arranged
that only skull fragments be tested initially.  However it was Woodward
who kept Keith from testing the Piltdown specimens even though he had
used Keith's services before and after.  It was Woodward who carefully
restricted access to the specimens.  At no time did Woodward give the
specimens the careful physical examination that would have exposed the
hoax.  The vagueness about the location of the second find is peculiar.
At one point he designated the site as being at a particular farm on
the Netherfield side of the Ouse; later he "forgot" this and designated
it as being on the Sheffield Park side, location unknown.  Millar remarked
on the "charmed life" of the hoax.  Perhaps the charmed life was stage
managed.
</p><p>
It has been argued that Woodward's correspondence with Dawson establishes
his innocence.  This is not so.  If Woodward were a conspirator their
correspondence would have been artifacts, part of the hoax.  It should
be remembered that copies of Museum correspondence were kept as part of
the official record.  For many years afterward Woodward returned to the
Piltdown site for further digs; nothing was found.  This may be the
best argument for his innocence.
</p><p>
Although a strong case against Woodward can be made it is not definite.
It is impossible to prove that Dawson did not have access to all of the
specimens used to construct the hoax.  Woodward's "errors" could have
been unfortunate incompetence.

<h2>Myths and misconceptions</h2>

Piltdown man has been the focus of many myths and misconceptions, many of which are
assiduously repeated by creationists for whom Piltdown man is a popular club with
which to assail evolution.  They include:

<h3>It's all the British Museum's fault</h3>
<p>
Gould
and others have criticized the British Museum for keeping the fossils "under wraps".
suggesting that the hoax might have been exposed much earlier.
It is true that access to the fossils were restricted.  This is normal practice for
rare and valuable fossils.  
However it is doubtful that this "security" protected the hoax.
The fossils were available for examination.  The tests that exposed the hoax could
have been performed at any time.  The single most important thing that protected
the hoax from exposure was that nobody thought of the possibility.
However in reading the history of the find it is clear that the
leading paleontologists had access to the Piltdown man specimans.  For example, Hrdlicka
examined them; his rejection of the mandible and cranium being from the same animal was
based on direct examination.
Following the revelation of the fraud
<a href="#hinton">Martin Hinton</a>, Deputy
Keeper in the Dept. of Zoology at the British Museum.
wrote to the <i>Times</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>
Had the investigators been permitted to handle the actual specimens,
 I think the spurious nature of the jaw would have been detected long
 ago.
</blockquote>
<p>
 Wilfred Le Gros Clark, a member of the team that exposed the forger,
 wrote to Hinton reminding him that Woodward had in fact allowed other
 specialists to examine the originals. The charge seems to have stuck,
 however. (Frank Spencer, <i>The Piltdown Forgery</i>, p. 149).
</p>
<p>
It does seem to be the case that access to the fossils was quite
restricted in later years.
In his autobiographical book <i>By the Evidence</i> Leakey
said when he saw Piltdown in 1933:
</p>
<blockquote>
	I was not allowed to handle the originals in any way, but merely

<h3>The hoax was swallowed uncritically</h3>
<p>
This is a half truth; almost no one publicly
raised the possibility of a deliberate hoax.
There were rumors circulating, however.
William Gregory, a paleontologist at the American
Museum of Natural History wrote in <i>Natural History</i>
in May of 1914:
</p><blockquote>
"It has been suspected by some that geologically [the bones] are not that
old at all; that they may even represent a deliberate hoax, a negro or
Australian skull and a broken ape jaw, artificially fossilized and
planted in the grave bed, to fool scientists."
</blockquote>
<p>
He went on, however, to vigorously deny the charge, concluding
</p>
<blockquote>
"None of the experts who have scrutinized the specimens and the gravel
pit and its surroundings has doubted the genuineness of the discovery."
</blockquote>
<p>
In general, however, the finds were accepted as being genuine fossils
but were not accepted uncritically as being
from an ancient human ancestor.
There was an early and recurring doubt that the jaw and the skull were from two different
animals, that the jaw was from an archaic chimpanzee and that the skull was from a relatively
modern human being.  Notable critics include
Dr. David Waterston of King's College, the French paleontologists Marcellin
Boule and Ernest Robert Lenoir, Gerrit Miller, curator of mammals at the Smithsonian, and
Professor Ales Hrdlicka.
</p><p>
Initially there were many more critics, e.g. Osborn.  However the finding of the second
skull converted many of the critics.  Finding a jaw
from one animal near the skull of another might be an accident of juxtaposition -- two
such finds is quite unlikely to be an accident.  Some critics, e.g. Lenoir and Hrdlicka
remained unconvinced none-the-less.
</p>
<p>
The following quote comes from a "The Evolution of Man", a 1927 book by
Grafton Elliot Smith:
</p><blockquote>
	"Yet it [the skullcap] was found in association with the
	fragment of a jaw presenting so close a resemblance to the type
	hitherto known only in Apes that for more than twelve years many
	competent biologists have been claiming it to be the remains of
	a Chimpanzee."
</blockquote>
<p>
Franz Weidenreich in 1946, in his book "Apes, Giants, and Men" (Note that
Weidenreich was an extremely respected scientist, having done most of
the work on the Peking Man skulls):
</p>
<blockquote>
  In this connection, another fact should be considered.  We know of a
  lower jaw from the Lower Pleistocene of southern England which is
  anatomically, without any doubt, the jaw of an anthropoid.  The trouble
  is that this jaw, although generally acknowledged as a simian jaw, has
  been attributed to man because it was found mixed with fragments of an
  undoubtedly human brain case.  I am referring to the famous Piltdown
  finds and to Eoanthropus, as the reconstructed human type has been
  called by the English authors...

  Therefore, both skeletal elements cannot belong to the same
  skull.
</blockquote>
<p>
It should also be mentioned that in 1950 Ashley Montagu and Alvan T. Marston mounted major
attacks on the interpretation of the Piltdown fossils as being from a
single animal.

<a name="doctoral_theses">
<h3>500 doctoral dissertations were written on Piltdown man</h3>
<p>
This claim appears in creationist sources.  Gary Parker's
pamphlet "Origin of Mankind", Impact series #101, Creation-Life Publishers (1981)
makes the claim without qualification or source.
<a href="#lubenow">Lubenow's</a> <i>Bones of Contention</i> (1992)
remarks that it is
said that there were 500 doctoral dissertations but does not give a source.
</p><p>
This claim is clearly in error.
When one considers
the small number of PhD's in paleontology being granted currently and the even smaller
number 80 years ago and the diversity of topics chosen for PhD theses a figure of half
a dozen seems generous; in all probability there were none whatsoever.  John Rice Cole
notes that in the 20s there were about 2
dissertations per year in physical anthropology in the entire US on ANY topic.
</p>
<p>
Robert Parson made a systematic search of the bibliographies of
<i>The Piltdown Forgery</i> by Weiner, <i>The Piltdown Inquest</i> by
Blinderman, <i>Piltdown: A Scientific Forgery</i> and
<i>The Piltdown Papers</i> by Spencer, <i>The Antiquity of Man</i> (1925)
and <i>New Discoveries Relating to the Antiquity of Man</i> (1931) by
Sir Arthur Keith.  Spencer and Keith's works have extensive references
and bibliographies of the primary research literature.  There are no references
to any doctoral dissertations.  Likewise Millar's bibliography contains
no references to any doctoral dissertation.
</p>
<p>
It is not clear whether this claim is a simple fabrication or whether it is an
erroneous transcription from another source.  In the introduction
to <i>The Piltdown Men</i> (1972), Millar says "it is estimated that some five
hundred essays were written about [Piltdown man]".  This estimate is credible,
the 1920 edition of H.G. Wells' <i>The Outline of History</i> remarks
"more than a hundred books, pamphlets, and papers have been written [about Piltdown
Man]". W. & A. Quenstedt listed over 300 references in 1936 in
Hominidae fossiles. <i>Fossilium Catalogus</i> I:
 Animalia, <i>74</i>: 191-197.
</p>
<p>
Millar gives no source, evidently not considering the matter to be
important enough to document.
However it probably was the 
editorial in the 10 July 1954 issue of <i>Nature</i> (vol. 274, # 4419,
 pp. 61-62) 
which describes a meeting of the Geological Society (30 June 1954)
 devoted to the exposure of the hoax. The editorial (unsigned) says:
</p>
<blockquote>

 "It is agreed that the skull fragments are human and not of great
 antiquity; that the jawbone is ape; that they have no important
 evolutionary significance. More than five hundred articles and
 memoirs are said to have been written about Piltdown man. His rise
 and fall are a salutary example of human motives, mischief and
 mistake."
</blockquote>
<p>
By coincidence, Spencer's <i>The Piltdown Papers</i> (1990) contains 500 letters,
i.e. 500 items of correspondence between Piltdown principals.  However this cannot
be the source of the number 500 since <i>The Piltdown Papers</i> appeared well
after Parker's pamphlet and Millar's book.
</p>

<p>
The most plausible explanation for this myth is that Millar and Parker both
used the same source, the <i>Nature</i> editorial, and that Parker assumed
that papers and memoirs were dissertations.  In turn Lubenow's source was probably the
Parker pamphlet.  The
truth, however, is unknown.

<a name="correcting">
<h3>This is a good example of Science correcting itself</h3>
<p>
It has been argued that this is a good example of science correcting its errors.  This
argument is a bit roseate.  As the Daily Sketch wrote:
</p><blockquote>
Anthropologists refer to the hoax as 'another instance of desire for fame leading a
scholar into dishonesty' and boast that the unmasking of the deception is 'a tribute to
the persistence and skill of modern research'.  Persistence and skill indeed!  When they
have taken over forty years to discover the difference between an ancient fossil and a
modern chimpanzee!  A chimpanzee could have done it quicker.
</blockquote><p>
Far from being a triumph of Science the hoax points to common and
dangerous faults.  The hoax succeeded in large part because of the
slipshod nature of the testing applied to it; careful examination 
using the methods available at the time would have immediately
revealed the hoax.  This failure to adquately examine the fossils
went unmarked and unnoticed at the time - in large part because
the hoax admirably satisfied the theoretical expectations of the
time.
</p><p>
The hoax illuminates two pitfalls to be wary of in the
scientific process.
The first is the danger of inadequately examining and challenging
results that confirm the currently accepted scientific interpretation.
The second is that a result, once established, tends to be uncritically
accepted and relied upon without further reconsideration.
</p>
<a href="#myths">Back to myths and misconceptions</a><br>
<a name="unimportant">
<h3>The hoax was unimportant</h3></a>
<p>
Robert Parson pointed out in a talk.origins posting that the
Piltdown hoax was a scientific disaster of the first magnitude.
He said:
<blockquote>
Piltdown "confirmed" hypotheses about our early ancestors that were
    in fact wrong - specifically, that the brain case developed before
    the jaw. The early Australopithecine fossils found by <a href="#dart">Dart</a> 
    in South Africa in the 1920's failed to receive the
    attention due to them for this reason.  The entire reconstruction of
    the history of the evolution of humanity was thrown off track until the 1930's.
</blockquote><blockquote>
 Prominent anthropologists, such as <a href="#woodward">Arthur Smith Woodward</a>,
 <a href="#keith">Arthur Keith</a>,
    and <a href="#smith">Grafton Elliot Smith</a>,
    wasted years of their lives exploring
    the properties of what turned out to be a fake. The lingering
    suspicion that one of them might have been involved in the forgery
    will cloud their reputations forever.
</blockquote>
<p>
More than five hundred articles and memoirs were written about the Piltdown
finds before the hoax was exposed; these were all wasted effort.  Likewise
articles in encyclopedias and sections in text books and popular books of
science were simply wrong.  It should be recognized that an immense amount of
derivative work is based upon a relatively small amount of original finds.
For many years the Piltdown finds were a significant percentage of the fossils
which were used to reconstruct human ancestry.
<p>
It is a black mark on science that it took 40 years to expose a hoax that
bore directly on human ancestry.  Creationists have not been slow in pointing
to the hoax, the erroneous reconstructions based on the hoax, and the long
time it took to expose the hoax.

<h2>Who the players were</h2>

<p>
<a name="abbot"></a>
<i>Lewis Abbot</i> was a jeweler in Hastings.  He knew
Dawson since 1900 through the Hastings museum.  He was
an authority on Wealdan flora and fauna and its ancient
gravels and, more generally, the geology of southern
England.  Weiner described him as "fiery, bombastic,
inspiring and weird."
</p>

<p>
<a name="barlow"></a>
<i>Frank O. Barlow</i> was a staff member of the British
Museum of Natural History.  He prepared plaster casts of
the Piltdown skull.
</p>

<p>
<a name="butterfield"></a>
<i>William Butterfield</i> was the curator at the Hastings
museum.  Ordinarily of calm and placid temperament, he
quarreled with Dawson over Dawson's appropriation of some
dinosaur fossils for the British Museum.
</p>
<p>
<a name="dart"></a>
<i>Raymond Dart</i> held the chair of Anatomy in the University
of Witwatersrand in South Africa.  He discovered Australopithecus (Taung baby) and
was the principal early exponent of an African origin for humanity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="dawson"></a>
<i>Charles Dawson</i> was an amateur archaeologist, geologist,
antiquarian, and was a collector of fossils for the British museum.  He was the original
person to seriously search for fossils in the Piltdown quarry.  In 1912 he and Woodward
discovered the the first Piltdown skull.  In 1915 he discovered
the second skull.  He died in 1916 shortly after the finds.
</p>

<p>
<a name="doyle"></a>
<i>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</i> was a neighbor of Dawson's and had an
interest in paleontology.  At one point he participated in the Piltdown digs.  He was the
victim of the "fairies in the garden" hoax.  Doyle wrote <i>The Lost World</i> and a
number of popular mysteries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="edmonds"></a>
<i>F. H. Edmonds</i> was a British geologist in the Geological Survey. His papers in 1925
and 1951 cast doubt respectively on the assigned age of Piltdown man and on there
being a plausible source for Piltdown animal fossils.
</p>

<p>
<a name="gould"></a>
<i>Stephen Jay Gould</i> is a paleontologist at Harvard University.
Gould and Niles Eldredge introduced the "punctuated equilibrium" theory.  Gould is the
author of a number of popular collections of essays.  He has suggested that Teilhard de
Chardin was the author of the hoax.
</p>

<p>
<a name="hargreaves"></a>
<i>Venus Hargreaves</i> was the workman who assisted Dawson, Woodward, and
Teilhard deChardin in the Piltdown digs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="hinton"></a>
<i>Martin A. C. Hinton</i> was a member of the Sussex circle of paleontologists
before the hoax and a curator of zoology at the British Museum at the time
of the fraud.  He was an expert on the effect of deposition of fossils in
gravel.  Hinton was noted for his practical jokes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="keith"></a>
<i>Sir Arthur Keith</i> was an anatomist and paleontologist, keeper
of the Hunterian collection of the Royal College of Surgeons, and president of the
Anthropological Institute.
</p>
<p>
<a name="matthews"></a>
<i>L Harrison Matthews</i> was an eminent English biologist
who wrote an 
influential series of articles in New Scientist in 1981 in which it was 
postulated that Dawson planted the original finds and Hinton, with the 
aid of Teilhard, planted the later objects.  
Matthews was a friend of Hinton. 
</p>

<p>
<a name="smith"></a>
<i>Grafton Elliot Smith</i> was a fellow of the Royal Society and in 
1909 became the holder of the chair of anatomy at the University of Manchester.  Smith had
made a special study of fossil men.  He was
one of the select crew that participated in the Piltdown dig.
</p>

<p>
<a name="sollas">
<i>W. J. Sollas</i> was a Professor of Geology at Oxford.  He was acerbic, ecentric, and
a bitter enemy
of Woodward and of Keith.  
<p>
<a name="teilhard"></a>
<i>Pierre Teilhard de Chardin</i> was a friend of Dawson, a Jesuit,
a paleontologist, and a theologian.  He participated in the discovery of Peking man and
Piltdown man.  He is popular for his theological theories which are considered heretical
by the Catholic church.
</p>

<p>
<a name="weiner"></a>
<i>J. S. Weiner</i> was an eminent paleontologist.  In 1953 he
realized that Piltdown man might have been a hoax.  J.S. Weiner, Sir Kenneth
Oakley and Sir Wilfrid Le Gros Clark jointly exposed the hoax.
</p>

<p>
<a name="woodward"></a>
<i>Sir Arthur Smith Woodward</i> was the keeper of the British
Museums's Natural History Department and was a friend of Dawson.  His specialty was
paleoichthyology.  His subordinate, W.P. Pycraft, who was in charge of the anthropology
section which dealt with fossil humanity, was an ornithologist.  Neither was knowledgable
about human anatomy, a fact which facilitated the hoax.
