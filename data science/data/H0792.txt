<B>Introduction</B>

<P>
<IMG SRC="/pictures/letters/T.gif" ALT="T" ALIGN=LEFT>his work is
based on the book <I>Origin and Destiny of the Earth's Magnetic
Field</I> by Thomas G. Barnes, I.C.R. Technical Monograph No. 4,
copyright July, 1973, by the <a href="http://www.icr.org/"> Institute
for Creation Research</a>. Barnes earned an A.B. degree in physics
from Hardin-Simmons College, Abilene, Texas in 1933, and an
M.S. degree from <a href="http://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a>
in 1936.  In1950, the re-named <a
href="http://www.hsutx.edu/">Hardin-Simmons University</a> awarded
Barnes the honorary degree, D.Sc.  He is emeritus professor of
physics, <a href="http://www.utep.edu/">University of Texas at El
Paso</a>, where he joined the faculty in 1936.

<P>
In this book, Barnes advances the argument that the observed
exponential decay of the Earth's magnetic field proves that the Earth
cannot be more than about 10,000 years old. It is my intention to show
that this argument is flawed in the extreme, and is therefore without
any merit. At this time I have not seen the second edition of the
book, though I know that one exists. All of my comments and arguments
are therefore directed only towards the first edition, cited at the
top of the page. So far as I know the second edition is out of print
at this time.

<P> I have inserted a few additional references that came to my
attention only after this article was essentially finished. I just
stuck them into the numbered sequence with little letters; it's a lot
easier than going through and renumbering all those references each
time I find something. I could refine and rewrite forever, but I have
to stop and submit it someday. Nevertheless, I believe the reference
list is quite complete, and should provide broad exposure to all sides
of the argument. 

<P>
<B>Elementary Concepts</B>

<P> The first thing I want to try to do is to introduce the reader to
the basic concepts needed to, hopefully, make sense of the various
arguments. However, of necessity I cannot embark on a detailed and
technical explication of the physics involved. There are references
that one can consult to learn more of those details, for those who
wish to do so. The books by Merrill &amp; McElhinney [1], and
J.A. Jacobs [2], do treat the technical details, but also carry enough
more general material that the less mathematically inclined readers
should be able to get something out of them. The less timid, or more
mathematically inclined, can go after the two books [3,4] that
comprise the proceedings of the 1992 NATO Advanced Study Institute on
the theory of solar and planetary dynamos.  

<P>
There are two primary methods by which one can generate a mathematical
description of the Earth's magnetic field, or any other field for that matter.
One way, which I will call the physical model, is to derive the form of the
field directly from the equations that govern the physical processes by which
the field is generated. The other, which I will call the empirical model, is
to use the known value of the field at some set of points, as a basis for
guessing what the value would be, at points where no measurements were made.
By now, scientists have used both methods extensively, but historically the
empirical model was developed first, since at the time the Earth's magnetism
was first discovered and studied, the physics by which it could be generated
was completely unknown.

<P>
The standard empirical method for modeling the values of any three dimensional
field is called spherical harmonics. This mathematical tool was invented by the
ubiquitous German mathematician, Carl Freidrich Gauss, circa 1835, for the
purpose of evaluating the Earth's magnetic field. This ingenious method uses an
infinite sum of trigonometric functions to evaluate a field, on the surface of
a sphere embedded in the field. Since any surface can be evaluated, then the
complete three dimensional shape of the field can be returned by extending the
analysis to an integration over a family of nested, concentric spheres, which
fills the space of interest.

<P> Of course, in practice, real computers cannot carry out an
infinite sum, and have to stop summing after a finite number of
terms. But, as you might imagine, modern computers can add a lot of
numbers together very fast, so while this may have been a fundamental
problem for Gauss, it is no longer all that bothersome.	 One can
approximate the true shape of the field by extending the sum to an
arbitrarily large number of terms, the only limitation being the
practicalities involved. In practice, the magnetic field is measured
constantly at a number of official magnetic observatories all over the
world, as well as at universities, or by other scientific teams and
expeditions, and now several spacecraft measure the field well above
the Earth, and out into deep space. These data are then fed into
computer programs which use spherical harmonics to create a model for
the field everywhere on the Earth. These models are actively tested
and refined until they match the observed field to within the limits
set by natural and unavoidable experimental uncertainties.  
<P> It is very important to keep in mind that the empirical model is
built entirely from a statistical analysis of the data themselves. It
is essentially independent from whatever physics might be involved in
generating the field. One of Barnes' many mistakes is to insist that
only the dipole component of the magnetic field is generated by
currents within the Earth, and that all lesser components (called
'higher order components' in physics jargon) are generated by some
other process, such as magnetic rocks or telluric currents (electric
currents induced in the crust, for example, by lightning in
thunderstorms, or induced as a reaction to currents in the
ionosphere). This is a poor idea, as it is very hard to reconcile with
the spatial extent of these higher order components, as illustrated by
figure 2.5 in [1, page 25]. It is very hard to imagine a field of
magnetic rocks, or a coherent telluric current, either of which is as
large as one half or one quarter of the Earth. But Barnes is
essentially forced to commit this error as a natural result of his
rejection of dynamo theory, and his model of an exponentially decaying
current in the Earth's core as the source of the Earth's magnetic
field. I make note of this error in order to emphasize that Barnes'
failure has a lot to do with very fundamental aspects of the problem,
which he hides behind a smoke screen of superfluous detail, as we
shall see.  

<P> The physical model for describing the Earth's magnetic field
carries the impressive looking name magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), but is
also commonly called dynamo theory. Simply stated, it has been shown
that turbulent motions within an electrically conductive fluid will
generate magnetic fields. However, the mathematical equations which
govern the physics of the problem are frightfully complicated, and may
well constitute the single most difficult mathematical problem in all
of geophysics. MHD models require the simultaneous solution of a full
set of coupled non-linear vector differential equations. This problem,
so far as I know, still does not have a completely general analytical
solution, though some special cases do. The complex cases are
invariably modeled numerically with high speed computers. These
methods are less well developed than the empirical models, but much
progress has been made over the last few years. Their eventual
solution promises to deliver results that empirical models cannot,
namely an understanding of the complex physics involved. At this time
computational MHD models act like real, observed magnetic fields, and
there is little doubt but that MHD will eventually deliver a full
description of the Earth's magnetic field.  

<P> The important thing to remember here is that the problem is not
solved. One should not conclude from this that scientists do not know
anything at all. On the contrary, they know a great deal, as a perusal
of the references I gave above will show. They just don't know
everything, and cannot answer every question. Nobody knows, yet, by
exactly what mechanism specific fluid motions generate the Earth's
specific magnetic field, but the presence of turbulent motions in the
Earth's fluid outer core can hardly be denied, and physical models do
show that the expected velocities will, in general, generate magnetic
fields. The short verdict is that there is no useful competing theory
for the existence of the Earth's magnetic field.  

<P>
<B>Origin and Destiny of the Earth's Magnetic Field</B>

<P> I will start with a brief outline of the book itself, for which
the table of contents, reproduced in table 1, will serve. The first
section, Origin and Destiny of the Earth's Magnetic Field, is in the
author's words, a "self contained treatment for the layman, teaching
him the elementary physics involved and showing him how it applies to
the source of the earth's magnetic field." The following three
sections are reprints of Barnes' original technical papers, published
earlier in the Creation Research Society Quarterly (the original
publication dates and/or citations are not given in the book, but they
can be found in other sources, and I have inserted them here in
parentheses, where "CRSQ" is the Creation Research Society
Quarterly). The technical development is therefore a bit confused,
with some repetition. However, the table of contents is detailed and
so provides a pretty good outline of the book's contents. The
presentation is a bit unusual; there are only 64 numbered pages, but
all of the pages are printed on only one side.

<P>
<B>Exponential Decay?</B>

<P> The obvious place to start is with the fundamental assertion of
the book, that the Earth's magnetic field is exponentially
decaying. If this turns out to be untrue, or unsupportable, then
Barnes' entire thesis is immediately nullified.	 So the next most
obvious thing to do at this point is to present the reader with the
data. These data, which follow in my table 2, are taken from Barnes
(pages 33 &amp; 61). Barnes in turn credits the ESSA report of
McDonald &amp; Gunst [5] as his source. I once saw a copy of that
report, but am not able to find it now. I presume that Barnes can
copy, and that the data are as given in [5]. In any case, these are
the data that Barnes presents in defence of his own thesis, so the
enterprising reader can examine the data as they see fit, in order to
guage compliance with the exponential decay hypothesis. Multiple
values for one year indicate separate determinations, reported in
separate original references. Those references are given by Barnes,
but I have omitted them here.

<P> Before we go any farther, the attentive reader should have already
spotted at least one problem. This table does not show any
experimental uncertainties associated with any of the data
points. This is the manner in which Barnes presents the data, and
nowhere in his book is the subject of experimental uncertainty
mentioned at all. I have not seen the McDonald &amp; Gunst paper in
preparing this article, so I cannot say whether or not they presented
the data without uncertainties as well, but if they did, then their
own argument suffers from the omission just as Barnes' argument does
here.  
<P> From these data Barnes has determined that the Earth's magnetic
field is decaying exponentially. Throughout his book, whenever he
mentions this exponential decay, he points the reader to section II-D,
page 36 to view the justification. On that page of his book, he
justifies the exponential decay conclusion as follows, the emphasis is
mine. B0, as referred to by Barnes, is the equatorial magnetic field
strength, which is included in his tables, but omitted from mine.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	"When values of the magnetic moment, M, in table 1 are
	plotted against time, t, on semi-log coordinate paper, the
	points lie approximately on a straight line, as one would expect
	for an exponential decay of the Earth's magnetic moment. This
	is also true, of course, for a plot of B0 against t. <I>We therefore
	assume that the decay is exponential and write</I> ... "
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> This, of course, is no justification at all. Barnes simply assumed
that the decay was exponential. However, later in the book, at the
beginning of section IV, page 52, Barnes makes a slightly more heroic
attempt to justify the exponential decay theory as follows: 

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	"All data were processed on a CDC3100 electronic computer.
	A least square exponential fit was employed to evaluate the
	time constant. As a separate check it was noted that the
	variability was smaller for this exponential fit than for a
	straight line fit, as one would expect from the exponential
	solutions obtained from Maxwell's equations."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> In these two passages we see the full and entire text of the
justification for deriving an exponential decay from the tabulated
data. Anyone reading this who has had experience with numerical
approximations, data curve fitting, and etc.  should be able to
recognize at once that the argument is very poor. First, it should be
obvious that one cannot perform an unweighted fit, completely ignoring
any experimental uncertainties. The early data from the mid 1800's,
which are derived from experimental methods that are far less accurate
and precise than modern methods, necessarily have much larger
uncertainties associated with them, and should be weighted accordingly
in any attempt to fit the data to a curve.  Second, Barnes' reference
to the "variability" of the exponential versus straight line fit is
highly ambiguous. Is "variability" supposed to mean "variance"? If the
variance of the fit is greater than the experimental uncertainties,
then the line and exponential cannot be distinguished, in fact, one
from the other. And what does "smaller" mean? Was the difference in
variance between the two fits (if that is what "variability" means)
significant or not?  These kinds of curve fitting exercises are
frought with peril, and relying on the difference in variance between
fits, where it is obvious that in fact either an exponential or a
straight line will produce a "good" fit, is an exceptionally
unreliable procedure.  
<P> Even without a plot, just by looking at the data tabulated above,
the reader should be able to see that the moment values since 1935
appear essentially flat around a value of about 8.047 +/- 0.029, while
the data prior to 1935 show a clear downward trend. One could easily
argue that two straight lines fit the data better than one, and even
better than one exponential (this is an exercise that I have not
undertaken, but the motivated reader is welcome to see if my intuition
is trustworthy). That fact alone will easily explain why a single
exponential will fit the data better than a single straight line, as
the slight curve of the exponential can better approximate the kink in
the data. These considerations make it extremely difficult to use the
data alone as an a-priori justification for any particular curve fit
over another. In fact, one could over interpret the data even to the
extent of claiming that the field was in decay until about 1935, when
it then stopped decaying.  

<P>
<B>Barnes and Dynamo Theory</B>

<P> At this point we can see that the claim of an exponential decay is
quite without merit. Since this is the central edifice of Barnes'
hypothesis, we could simply end our criticism right here. However,
Barnes also argues strenuously against the standard theory of dynamo
action generating the Earth's magnetic field. But in making such an
argument Barnes is required to make a number of highly unreasonable
assertions that I will outline here. As I already pointed out in the
introduction, I will not go into the details of dynamo theory myself,
but refer the reader to the sources indicated in my reference section.

<P> Barnes gives two reasons for rejecting dynamo theory, both
completely inadequate. His primary reason is a bold assertion that all
dynamo models are ruled out by Cowling's theorem. This theorem was
derived by T.G. Cowling [6a] while he was working under Oliver Lodge
on the problem of sunspot magnetic fields. But, it is a general
theorem, which proves that an axially symmetric field cannot be
maintained through a self sustaining dynamo by an axially symmetric
current. Barnes has a great deal of faith in the ability of Cowling's
theorem to disable dynamo theory. In section I-F, on page 9, Barnes
says (I have not included his references) ...

	"In every case this dynamo theory has been shown to
	be inadequate and untenable. It is supposed to be related
	to hypothetical movements of fluid in the core of the
	earth. However, rigorous mathematical analyses,
	such as that by T.G. Cowling, prove that any plausible
	motion of fluids in the earth's core cannot produce the
	dynamo, even if the hypothesized motions did exist."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
And again, in section III-D, pages 44-45, Barnes has this to say (I have once
again not included his footnotes, the emphasis is from Barnes' original):

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	"To make matters worse for the dynamo concept,
	Cowling (1934) <I>proved that is not possible for fluid
	motions to generate a magnetic field with axial
	symmetry</I> (such as the dipole field of the earth).
	Cowling's theorem is indeed a blow to the
	evolutionary efforts to develop a dynamo theory.
	It eliminates the possibility of a straight forward
	theory for a self-exciting dynamo to sustain the earth's
	magnetic field. Nevertheless, futile efforts continue and
	one still finds claims, but no proof, of a dynamo in the
	core of the earth."
<BR>
	[ ... ]
<BR>
	"Note that the only possibility of having a dynamo
	in the earth's core requires motion of fluid in the core
	of the earth; that such motion cannot be a simple rotation,
	or any other symmetric motion; and that all proposed
	motions have been unreasonably complex motions. As
	of now there is no physical evidence, seismic or otherwise,
	that there is any motion within the core."

<P> The second passage, from page 45, is certainly amazing. How could
there <I>not</I> be convective, turbulent motion in a rotating fluid
shell heated from below [6b]?  

<P> While Barnes was certainly satisfied with the power of Cowling's
theorem, it is not evident that he had done his homework. Cowling
himself did not see things this way, and in 1957 [7], 16 years before
the publication date of Barnes' book, Cowling has this to say: 

<P>

	<I>[The abstract reads ... ]</I>
<BR>
	"A general type of mathematical argument is described,
	which applies to all the cases in which dynamo
	maintenance of a steady magnetic field by motion in a
	uniform mass is known to be impossible. The number of
	general classes of motion to which this type of argument
	applies is shown to be strictly limited. It is suggested that
	all proofs of the impossibility of dynamo maintenance for
	general classes of motion must be reducible to this type."

<BR>
	"The argument is certainly not complete, but it is

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> This shows that by 1957 it was already known that Cowling's
theorem was not the all powerful anti-dynamo theorem that some, even
Cowling, thought it was when the theorem was first presented. Barnes
seems quite unaware of the research that had gone into Cowling's
theorem in particular, in the years before his book was published.  He
also seems unaware of the 1970 review by E.N. Parker [8] into the
origin of the solar magnetic field. This review, also published before
Barnes' book, demonstrates the weakness of Barnes' claim that dynamo
theory is shown to be inadequate. I shall present here a somewhat
lengthy, but appropriate paragraph, from page 9 of Parker's paper
(emphasis is from Parker's original) ...  

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	"First of all, the original derivation of the dynamo equations
	(Parker 1955b, 1957), was heuristic, based on separate formal
	calculations of the separate aspects of the interaction of the
	cyclonic convective motions with the toroidal field. The whole
	picture, leading to equation 6, was then assembled through
	physical arguments, as presented above. Thus the theory did
	not represent a <I>formal mathematical proof</I> from the
	hydromagnetic equation 1 that fluid motions can regenerate
	a magnetic field. There was real concern at the time that some
	subtle aspect of the problem was overlooked in the construction
	of the dynamo equations, and that regenerative dynamos were
	not possible, i.e. there was concern that Cowling's theorem
	was but a special case of a general 'impossibility' theorem for
	homogenous dynamos. Cowling's theorem was not itself
	directly applicable, of course, because in view of the individual
	convective cells, the dynamo did not have axial symmetry nor
	was it stationary in time. But the dynamo did have axial
	symmetry and was stationary in time, if one averaged over
	the individual convective cells, as was done in constructing the
	right hand side of 6. There was no reason to assert that the
	dynamo equations were wrong, i.e. in violation of Cowling's
	theorem, but a <I>rigorous</I> proof of the existence of some sort of
	dynamo would be an important philosophical point.
	Consequently Backus (1958) constructed an idealized two-stage
	dynamo that could be handled rigorously. he avoided the poor
	convergence of the formal expansions of the stationary
	dynamo, used in earlier attempts at formal calculation, by
	turning on the two different fluid motions (corresponding to
	the nonuniform rotation and the cyclonic convective motions)
	alternately in short bursts, followed by extended periods of
	quiet. During the quiet periods the higher modes decay away,
	leaving only the lowest mode for the poloidal field and for the
	toroidal field. In this way he was able to show rigorously that
	there exist velocity fields in conducting fluids which regenerate
	magnetic fields."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> My point has been to show that, well before the publication of
Barnes' book, there was already a sufficient body of knowledge
available in the open literature, to show that both of Barnes' main
arguments thus far appear either weak, or simply false. But in
reality, Barnes is simply playing a trick on us.  He knows that
Cowling's theorem is limited to special cases, and even says so
himself in the passages I quoted above, from pages 44-45. By this time
Barnes is already working on the assumption that the exponential decay
of the magnetic moment is a proven fact, no longer open for
discussion. He uses this fact to support an oblique assertion that the
Earth's magnetic field is therefore necessarily generated by an
exponentially decaying current, flowing in a circular path within the
Earth's core. indeed, he goes to great length to draw on research done
by Horace Lamb in the late 1800's, and even goes so far as to hint
that the exponential decay theory is "Lamb's theory". If this
exponentially decaying current model were valid, then Barnes could
properly appeal to Cowling's theorem, since the axially symmetric
current, and the pure dipole component, together fit the limited class
of conditions in which Cowling's theorem prohibits dynamo maintenance.

<P> Barnes spends very little time in the book actually justifying his
claim that the field is seen to decay exponentially, or his surprising
claim that appropriate fluid motions cannot occur in the regime of the
Earth's core. Yet by now we can see that these claims are actually
central to his entire thesis, and their failure brings his argument
tumbling down in ruins. Good stage magicians will do their tricks very
quickly, right in front of you, and you won't see it. The rest of the
show is just that, show, with lots of colored lights, and dancing
girls. Barnes does the same thing, pulling his real tricks very
quickly, and distracting the reader with many pages of superfluous
details, and pages of detailed mathematics that are all based on false
premises anyway.  But all the while, he has already played his trick.

<P> The single most important point to take away from this article is
that the alleged empirical demonstration that the Earth's magnetic
field is decaying exponentially is false. As long as that is
understood, all of the rest of Barnes' arguments are seen as resting
on false premises.  

<P>
<B>Field Reversals</B>

<P> Barnes also spends some effort to refute the notion that the
Earth's magnetic field has ever reversed its polarity. Jacobs' book
[2] gives a good review of the subject, so I won't go into extensive
discussion. However, I will point out that here, too, Barnes has
managed to construct a remarkably weak argument.  Sections III-E
through III-H, pages 46-49 are devoted to a one-sided discussion of
the known phenomenon, that some rocks will self-reverse their own
remnant magnetism. As far as Barnes is concerned, that is enough to
label the field reversal "hypothesis' as false, or at least
unsupportable. However, at no time does Barnes ever talk about what
the real data are. He never mentions the extensive strips of
oppositely polarized sea floor sediments in the Atlantic ocean, nor
the extensive drill core data from the continents, nor that fact that
all of these data sets, from continents and sea floors all over the
world, are correlated. This clearly does not happen if all of these
reversals are local in nature, as in rocks self reversing, as opposed
to global in nature, as in the real field reversing. Barnes' ignoring
of the global systematic nature of the data renders his limited
objections quite weak. There is an excellent review article, written
for the non-specialist, on the current status of the study of
geomagnetic field reversals, in light of recent advances in dynamo
theory, in the September-October, 1996 issue of American Scientist [9].
Finally, I also note (as described later in this report) that creation
scientist D. Russell Humphreys has accepted the reality of field
reversals, though he thinks they happened on much shorter time scales
than do main stream physicists.

<P>
<B>Current Scientific Status</B>

<P> Origin and Destiny was first published 23 years ago, at a time
when some of Barnes' arguments might even have looked as if there were
some merit attached to them. His arguments are repeated without
modification today. However, the real state of dynamo theory has
progressed somewhat in the intervening decades, and it is probably a
good idea to take stock of that status at this point. Despite the
abject failure of Barnes' arguments, it is still at least fair to ask
the question, whether or not dynamo theory really is a reasonable idea
to explain the existence and behavior of the Earth's magnetic
field. As far as I am concerned, the answer is an unqualified yes.

<P> Eight years after the first edition of Barnes' book was published,
in 1981, Cowling followed up Parker's earlier review with another, for
the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics [10]. By then he was
already able to say this (only slightly different in appearance, since
my ASCII text will not reproduce mathematical symbols) ...  

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	"   Dynamo maintenance has been established for a wide range
	of steady motions. Childress (1967, 1970) and G.O. Roberts
	(1970,	1972) found that a spatially periodic motion could
	almost always provide maintenance. A number of
	investigations have considered dynamo maintenance in a
	liquid sphere, using numerical methods similar to those
	employed by Bullard &amp; Gellman (1954) in their pioneering
	work on dynamos. Several authors (e.g. Gubbins 1973, Pekeris
	et al. 1973) found that the original Bullard-Gellman dynamo
	does not work, as shown by a breakdown of convergence and
	of maintenance. Gubbins (1973) found that, whereas
	antidynamo theorems prove that motions symmetric about
	an axis cannot maintain magnetic fields with similar
	symmetry, they can maintain fields with polar components
	proportional to cos(mphi) or sin(mphi), where phi is the polar
	angle. The multiplicity of successful solutions has led some
	authors to suggest that all patterns of steady motion are
	capable of maintaining dynamos if some antidynamo theorem
	does not explicitly forbid it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Note that Cowling refers to work on antidynamo theorems by Gubbins
(1973), which is contemporary with the publishing of Barnes' first
edition, and that the work of Childress and G.O. Roberts predates
Barnes' first edition as well. This, along with my earlier
observations only reinforces the conclusion that research sufficient
to disprove Barnes' hypothesis existed well before the book was even
published. Also, Cowling's comment that almost any steady motion will
generate a dynamo, expands on Parker's 1970 observation that velocity
fields that were appropriate had already been proven to exist by
Backus as early as 1958.  Cowling goes on to discuss the pros and cons
of dynamo theory in considerable detail; his viewpoint, like Parker's
in 1970, was towards the solar magnetic field. Cowling's "Objections
to Dynamo Theory" section begins ...  

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	"So far, dynamo theory has been presented from the
	standpoint of a believer. Few doubts exist as to the
	applicability of dynamo theory in some form to the Earth's
	field, provided only that an adequate mechanism can be
	found to generate the necessary fluid motions. A solar
	dynamo is less certain, because of the high electrical
	conductivity of solar material."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Cowling then went on to discuss alternatives, in the case of the
sun, mostly theories put forth by Piddington, which include turbulent
fields or frozen in fields. But as Cowling says, dynamo maintenance
for the Earth's field was already an essentially foregone conclusion.

<P> The current status is extended essentially to the current time by
the proceedings of the NATO Advanced Study Institute that I mentioned
in the introduction [3,4]. Published in 1993 &amp; 1994, this is the
most recent, or most current general review in book form that I can
find (I am writing this in the fall of 1996). Although this study
concentrates on dynamo theory in general, especially as applied to the
sun, there are some papers of interest with regards the Earth, such as
"Energy Sources for Planetary Dynamos" by W.V.R.  Malkus, chapter 5 in
[4], and in [3] we find "Turbulent Dynamo and the Geomagnetic Secular
Variation" (pages 229-231) by Pilipenko et al., and "On the Role of
Rotation of the Internal Core Relative to the Mantle" (pages 265-270)
by Ruzmaikin. Since then it has been shown by some very nice
seismological work that the solid inner core of the Earth actually
does not rotate with the same axis, or at the same rate, as the Earth
outside the fluid core [11a]. This gives some sudden importance to
Ruzmaikin's "what if" scenario.	 

<P> Beyond that, one must consult the technical journals for the very
latest news on the details of dynamo theory. The days of its youth are
long gone, that a dynamo of some kind is responsible for the Earth's
magnetic field is no more in doubt now than it was when Cowling said
as much in 1981. The most recent noteworthy results were accomplished
by Gary Glatzmaier of Los Alamos National Laboratories and Paul
H. Roberts from UCLA. They made use of the (now known) fact that the
Earth's inner core rotates out of sync with the rest of the planet
[11a], and included this effect in their detailed model of the
geodynamo.  The result was a long period of stasis followed by a rapid
reversal in polarity, during which the field behaved generally as the
Earth's field does during real field reversals; the energy migrates
from the dipole component into the higher order components, and then
reforms a main dipole, with polarity reversed. This very recent result
is a major milestone in the history of dynamo theory, and is described
in a trio of recent journal papers [11b, 12, 13a]. In particular, this
result puts to rest once and for all, the notion advanced by Barnes,
that "No acceptable dynamo theory to sustain or oscillate the earth's
magnetic field has ever been conceived nor is one very likely."
[III-I, page 49]. So much for Barnes' bold prediction.	

<P>
<B>Notes Added in Proof</B>

<P> Contrary to some opinions, the work of Glatzmaier &amp; Roberts
does not represent the first time that geophysicists have ever been
able to make a computer model dynamo reverse polarity. Crossley,
Jensen &amp; Jacobs anticipated these results with realistic reversals
in their models, published in 1986 [13b]. But they were unable to
replicate physically realistic long-term field behavior. The work by
Glatzmaier &amp; Roberts was able to reproduce viable long-term
behavior around the reversal, and that is the real value of their
work. They also produced a much spiffier detailed analysis of the
reversal event itself.	

<P> The McDonald and Gunst study [5] brings up the question of the
short term variability of the Earth's magnetic field, which I did not
spend much time on while preparing this article. Their approach, which
was to consider only the dipole moment, is most appropriate to the
study of historical data, where that is really the only reliable
measure available. However, modern studies of field variability do not
approach the problem in such a simple manner. Rather, the time
variability of all of the field components are considered, and
characteristic time scales derived for each. The Earth's magnetic
field is quite variable over short time periods, and some of that
variation is internal in origin. Both of the basic books I have
recommended [1, 2] cover this topic in some detail. For a current look
at how the short term variations are considered, there is a recent
paper out of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory [30] that addresses
this issue.  

<P>
<B>Current Creationist Status</B>

<P> A second edition of Barnes' book was published in 1983 [14], and
he wrote a response [15] to G. Brent Dalrymple [16,17] in 1984, but I
have found nothing from Barnes on the matter since then. However, the
now well known and influential creation scientist D. Russell Humphreys
has taken up the mantle of the Earth's magnetic field.	

<P> Inspired by Barnes, Humphreys devised a creation science theory
for the origin of the Earth's magnetic field [18,19], and then
extended that theory to the planets in general [20]. He then followed
the journey of the Voyager spacecraft as it explored the outer
planets, and hailed the Voyager measurements of the outer planet
magnetic fields as a confirmation of his theory [21,22]. 

<P> Humphreys' theory [20] is typical of a style that he has held to
ever since, a mixture of physics and divine intervention. In this
case, he postulates that God created everything initially out of
water, which is a strongly polar molecule. If the Sun and planets are
created entirely out of water, and created with some substantial
fraction of those water molecules sharing a parallel alignment of their
magnetic moments, then the resultant magnetic field of the parent body
will also be substantial. But those alignments will collapse rapidly
after creation, and the collapsing magnetic field will induce an
electric current such as to resist the field collapse (in physics this
is called Lenz's law). That establishes the field and the
exponentially decaying current. God then intervenes directly and
transforms everything into its present constituents, leaving the
fields and currents intact. The result is an exponentially decaying
field and current system similar to that described by Barnes. As
Humphreys put it [20, page 141] ...

<P> The physics of Humphreys' theory, such as it is, can be represented
by a single equation [20, page 142, equation 1]: 
<center>
Mc = k (m/mw) uw
</center>

<P> where Mc is the magnetic dipole strength at creation, m is the mass
of the planet, mw is the mass of a water molecule, uw is the magnetic
moment of a water molecule, and k is the fraction (0 to 1) of the molecules
which have their dipoles aligned at creation. Plug in the MKS units, and
numerically we get [20, page 142, equation 2] (MKS units work out to
Joules/Tesla or J/T): 
<center>
Mc = k (0.9425) m
</center>

<P> Assume that the dipole today (M) is the result of an exponential
decay since creation [20, page 143, equation 3]: 
<center>
M = Mc exp(-t/T)
</center>

<P> where t is the time since creation, and T is a characteristic decay
time that depends on the core of the planet as in
[20, page 143, equation 4]:
<center>
T = (u0 * sig * R^2) / pi^2  seconds
</center>

<P> where u0 is the magnetic permeability constant (4*pi x 10^7 in MKS units
of Henry per meter), sig is the core conductivity, R is the core radius, and
pi is the usual 3.14159... Finally, if you know the time since creation, you
can compute an expected characteristic decay time as in
[20, page 143, equation 5]: 
<center>
T = t / ln(Mc/M)
</center>

<P> I have presented these equations, because this last one is
actually quite important, in light of Humphreys' chosen method for
testing his theory on the magnetic field of the earth. Humphreys uses
a Barnes-type exponential fit to the dipole data for the earth, and
derives a characteristic decay time (T) of 2049 +/- 79 years. Setting
k = 0.25 he derives an Mc for the earth of 1.41 x 10^24 J/T. He then
plugs this value of Mc, the Biblical value of t and the current value
of M into the equation above, and computes a value of T = 2075 years,
concluding "This value agrees with the measured value in (7) to better
than two percent, well within the experimental error" [20, page
143]. However, because k is a free parameter in the equation for Mc,
so is Mc a free parameter in the equation above for T. This means that
Humphreys could not compute a value of T from his theory that was not
very close to his 'measured' value, since he can always find a
suitable arbitrary value for Mc.

<P> It is for this reason that I am not impressed by Humphreys' confidence
in his theory's ability to predict the magnetic dipole moments for Uranus
and Neptune, before the Voyager spacecraft observed them. Humphreys'
predictions for Uranus [20, page 146] and Neptune [20, page 147] both
state that the dipole strength should be "on the order of 10^24 J/T".
He connects these predictions to his theory by selecting a value for
k = 0.25 in both cases, computing a dipole strength at creation, and
then estimating a characteristic decay time assuming a core conductivity
similar to the terrestrial planets. This brings on the estimate of 10^24
J/T, but remember that the dipole at creation is an entirely free
parameter. A peek at Humphreys' table II [20, page 147] shows that
the dipole for Jupiter is 1.6 x 10^27, for Saturn 4.3 x 10^25, and
for Earth 7.9 x 10^22. From these values alone, with reference to
no theory at all, one can immediately see that the dipole values
for Uranus and Neptune must be larger that Earth's 10^22 and
smaller than Saturn's 10^25, so that anything in the 10^23 to
10^24 range is an obvious guess anyway. All Humphreys has to do
is come up with a dipole at creation that is about the same as
Saturn's is now, and the result is going to be very nearly right.
We now know the dipole values for Uranus [3.7 x 10^24 J/T] and
Neptune [2.1 x 10^24 J/T], which do indeed agree with Humphreys'
order of magnitude predictions. But to hail this as a confirmation
of his theory is not very rewarding. Indeed, it is my position that
Humphreys' theory cannot be confirmed, since it predicts at once
every possible observed field, and is therefore useless for
predicting anything.

<P> Eventually the Humphreys theory has become distinct from
the Barnes theory. Humphreys decided that the evidence in support of
the hypothesis that the Earth's magnetic field has reversed its
polarity a number of times is too convincing, and that such reversals
must have occurred. In doing so, Humphreys also rejects Barnes' idea
that the Earth's field has been decaying exponentially ever since
creation, and has instead postulated a more complex history for the
magnetic field, built around the presumption that the field reversals
happened very rapidly, taking perhaps no more than a few days to a few
weeks [23, 24].	 Humphreys had already postulated this idea, when he
found support from a paper by Coe &amp; Prevot in 1989 [25], which
showed evidence of a rapid change in the angle of the dipole moment of
the Earth's magnetic field during the cooling time of a lava flow. Coe
&amp; Prevot have expanded on the observations and theory since then
[26, 27a] (and so has Humphreys [28]), and the effect certainly
appears to be real, or at least credible. Humphreys has interpreted
these results as an implication that <I>all</I> field reversals are
very rapid, and this allows him to concentrate all of them into the
single year of the Genesis Flood. However, one must remember that the
results reported by Coe &amp; Prevot include only a few out of
hundreds or thousands of examples of field reversal measurements. The
vast majority of the known examples would have required the entire
reversal to take place while the lava flows were still hotter than the
Curie temperature, or worse yet, argue against rapid reversal by
recording what appear to be the intermediate stages of a single
reversal event. Finally, others have shown that the evident rapid
reversals described by Coe &amp; Prevot may be explained by processes
not related directly to those in the Earth's core [27b], but rather by
magnetic storm effects that may become significant at the surface of
the Earth during a reversal, when the dipole field is relatively weak.

<P> Humphreys outlined his postulated history for the Earth's magnetic
field in [23,24,29a]. He has a created magnetic dipole decaying
exponentially until the time of the flood. Atthe onset of the flood,
the dipole moment plummets rapidly, and thenoscillates very rapidly
(the rapid reversals) during the year of the flood. He the shows a
series of fluctuations from about 4000 to 1500 years before the present,
after which the field has been steadilydecaying. This invented scenario
depends heavily on the idea that allof the field reversals happened very
rapidly, and all during the yearof the flood. This can be seen in the
online version of Impact #242 [29a], an ICR publication. 

<P> There can be little doubt that Humphreys still holds to this idea
quite firmly.  He was asked about this by Carl Wieland, in an
interview published by Creation Magazine in 1993 [29]. Humphreys
reiterated his confidence in what he called his successful prediction
of magnetic field strengths from the Voyager observations, and spoke
as if his notion that all field reversals happened within a few days
was essentially a proven fact. This interview is available online via
the creation magazine website. I have not seen any creation science
writings on the Earth's magnetic field since then, and I presume that
the theory of Humphreys is the one that is now ascending in the
creation science community.  

<P>
<B>Subjective Observations and Closing Remarks</B>

<P> I certainly do not accept the ideas put forth by Barnes and
Humphreys, concerning the physics and history of the Earth's magnetic
field. However I do not believe that I have treated either with any
undue harshness. Barnes, despite his considerable background in
physics, did a horrible job, committing numerous blatant and trivial
errors along the way. Humphreys never takes Barnes to task, and goes
out of his way to avoid criticizing him at all. While Humphreys does a
much better job with his physics than did Barnes, Humphreys is not out
of the intellectual woods either. He has a strong tendency to
over-interpret results, and to over-emphasize the degree to which his
theories are predictive in nature, or to which they are congruent with
reality. His mix of divine intervention and physics is quite natural
for a creationist, but not at all acceptable to the
non-creationist. Moreover, it is not consistent with an unbiased
scientific investigation, in that it presumes what the result will be
before the experiment is done. As is my custom, civilized critiques,
comments and inquiries are always welcome, and I will do my best to
respond. For those of you impressed by credentials, or who wonder if I
am "qualified" to write such an article, I will point out that I have
<a href="http://thrasher.calstatela.edu/classes/physreq.html#bs">B.S.</a>
(1978) and <a href="http://thrasher.calstatela.edu/classes/physreq.html#ms">
M.S.</a> (1985) degrees in <a href="http://thrasher.calstatela.edu/">physics</a>,
from <a href="http://www.calstatela.edu/">California StateUniversity at
Los Angeles</a>, as well as a decade's worth of experienceas a radio
astronomer studying the magnetospheric environment of theouter planets.

<P> Finally, allow me to acknowledge the outstanding efforts of Brett
Vickers in maintaining the bottomless pit of the talk.origins archive,
especially as this is all done on a volunteer basis. The research for
this article was done at the library of California State University at
Los Angeles, my alma mater, and the libraries at Caltech and
JPL. However, concerned taxpayers may note that I did all of the work
on my own time.
