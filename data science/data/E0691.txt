      <h2><a name="about"></a>About GNE</h2>
      <p>GNE, or the Game Networking Engine, is a cross-platform, multithreaded, 
        C++ networking library with an API specifically addressing the needs of 
        game networking. There are two parts of GNE, the mid-level classes that 
        handle packeted, error checked, and bandwidth throttled communication 
        between two peers. This will be completed with GNE 0.5.</p>
      <p>The high-level classes will be worked on after GNE 0.5 and will handle 
        things like unique player ID's, player-to-player text communications, 
        and develop a framework for a game server. It will also have a list server 
        which is a server list players can connect to find games to play in.</p>
      <h2><a name="features"></a>Feature List</h2>
      <p>Legend: <span class="inLast">In 0.45</span> :: <span class="inCVS">In 
        current CVS</span> :: <span class="inNext">In 0.5</span> :: <span class="inFuture">In 
        GNE 1.0</span><br>
        The current CVS version also improves, extends, and fixes many bugs in 
        the areas already marked green.</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="inLast">Provide a C++ class interface for threads, mutexes, 
          and condition variables.</li>
        <li class="inLast">Provide a C++ class interface for timers and timer 
          callbacks.</li>
        <li class="inLast">A very capable and flexible logging and debugging system 
          which is filterable and reports various events to the log file (file 
          name, line number, class, this pointer, thread name, and printf style 
          messages).</li>
        <li class="inLast">Provide a simple C++ implementation of console I/O 
          functions to be used for the GNE examples, and for text-only servers 
          using GNE. This implementation is different from ncurses or conio because 
          it thread-aware to allow output and input to happen from multiple threads 
          at the &quot;same&quot; time.</li>
        <li class="inLast">Provide a C++ class interface for packets, from which 
          the user is expected to derive their game-specific packet classes from.</li>
        <li class="inLast">A set of standard packet classes.</li>
        <li class="inLast">Provide a proper way of serializing packets in endian-independant 
          format. Some of this functionality will be handled by HawkNL.</li>
        <li class="inFuture">Provide the user with a base client/server protocol 
          framework, handling these specific events, common to virtually any game: 
          <ul>
            <li class="inLast">Low-level connections which are bandwidth monitored 
              and controled.</li>
            <li class="inLast">Checking for server/client network protocol versions.</li>
            <li>Handling text messages to be sent to all players.</li>
            <li>Assigning unique IDs to players, and managing player lists, allowing 
              you to distribute data to the whole group, or parts of it.</li>
            <li>Players <span class="inLast">entering, leaving</span><span class="inNext">, 
              or timing out</span> at any time (the user can restrict joining 
              to game start only), handled directly by the GNE code.</li>
            <li>Time Syncronization between peers.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="inLast">Provide the user an abstraction of "connections" to 
          a server/client: 
          <ul>
            <li>Connections where all packets arrive and arrive in order (packets 
              over TCP, SPX or similar)</li>
            <li>Connections where all packets are not guaranteed arrival (UDP, 
              IPX or similar)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="inLast">Provide an event-driven scheme for responding to sockets, 
          which will work similarly to MFC. The user should overload the events 
          they wish to respond to.</li>
        <li class="inFuture">Provide a framework/protocol for a server list server, 
          similar to networks like battle.net or Half-Life, supporting multiple 
          types of games with optional game-specific information. Unlike battle.net, 
          the server list will simply act as a database sending a list of IP addresses, 
          their game type, and the optional game-specific data.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a name="progress"></a>Current Progress</h2>
      <p>GNE is passing the middle stages of development. With the completion 
        of GNE 0.5 the mid-level classes will be completed. After GNE 0.5 the 
        high-level classes will be designed, prototyped, implemented, then tested. 
        After that the list server will be implemented and GNE will be completed.</p>
      <p class="header3">Comming Features</p>
      <p>This latest version of GNE (0.49) was supposed to be 0.5, the completed 
        &quot;mid-level&quot; portion of GNE which is GNE without the high-level 
        game engine classes. There are a couple of simple missing features which 
        will be implemented in 0.5:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Timeouts are not yet detected automatically, but doing so yourself 
          now will not be overly difficult. Even the final version of timeout 
          detection will be somewhat limited as GNE cannot force the other end 
          to respond to anything, including PingPackets -- only you can send packets, 
          but GNE will trigger an event (onTimeout) after a connection has been 
          idle for a user-specified amount of time.</li>
        <li>Thread priorities have not been implemented because I haven't been 
          able to figure how how to do this portably with pthreads yet -- if you 
          know how, feel free to speak up ;).</li>
        <li>Throwing exceptions in the readPacket and maybe the writePacket methods 
          will be allowed and caught to signal the caller that parsing of the 
          packet cannot be completed. Not having this functionality is not very 
          bad right ow as TCP and UDP protocols guarantee that data inside of 
          packets is always sent correctly if it arrives, therefore readPacket 
          should only fail due to a programming error. For now it is advised that 
          you use asserts to check for this problem.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 align="center"><a name="help"></a>Help Wanted</h2>
      <p>I am currently looking for some people to help me with this project. 
        Anyone at any skill level will be able to help! Actually if you feel less 
        than confident about your networking programming ability then it is your 
        help I need the most, because I need to make sure the GNE API is easy 
        to use and understand for people who have not programmed on it and understand 
        it inside and out already (like me).</p>
      <p>I need people at this point in the project to start taking a part simply 
        by joining the mailing lists and/or commenting on the documentation and 
        API of GNE to help address the following questions and help with the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you understand the API? If not, is there a way it could be redone 
          or modified to help it become easy to use?</li>
        <li>Are you able to follow the documentation? Do you find the doxygen 
          documentation useful? Or is the Rose UML Diagrams more useful to you?</li>
        <li>Participate in the mailing list in helping choose the features of 
          GNE and how the API should work.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you are feeling like helping a more substantial amount, consider the 
        following ways you can help GNE improve faster:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Simply by downloading GNE, testing the examples and reporting errors.</li>
        <li>Becoming an official tester/maintainer of a particular port of GNE 
          and the makefiles that are used for it.</li>
        <li>Writing makefiles/scripts/project files for your own compiler that 
          is not already supported.</li>
        <li>Help with providing documentation/tutorials, adding examples, or adding 
          comments for the existing examples from perspectives other than mine.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And lastly, of course, if you feel up to it, I can always use an additional 
        coder or two, as right now I am working on the project myself in my spare 
        time.</p>
      <p>Any help you provide for GNE whether from an email of encouragement to 
        becoming an GNE developer will help to improve the quality and speed of 
        development of GNE and I thank you.</p>
      <h2><a name="Dependancies"></a>Dependancies</h2>
      <p>The following things are needed for GNE:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ISO-1998 compliant C++ compiler 
          <ul>
            <li>Out-of-the-Box for: 
              <ul>
                <li>Windows: MSVC6, MingW</li>
                <li>Linux: GCC 2.9x and GCC 3.x</li>
                <li>Solaris 8: Intel or UltraSparc CPUs, GCC 2.9x and GCC 3.x</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>MSVC 4 or 5 might also work, and other *NIX as well, but testers 
              are needed for this!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The <a href="http://www.hawksoft.com/hawknl/">HawkNL networking library</a> 
          from <a href="http://www.hawksoft.com/">HawkSoft</a>, version 1.5b2 
          or higher. The download link is on the left sidebar when you are in 
          the HawkNL section. Version 1.5b1 may be used but has a bug which will 
          cause GNE protocol violations due to it misreporting reliable packet 
          sizes.</li>
        <li>pthreads implementation (<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/">pthreads-win32 
          for Windows</a> used for Windows), UNIX already has pthreads support. 
          HawkNL comes with a binary distrobution which is acceptable to use with 
          GNE as well.</li>
        <li>A curses library like libncurses5.2 (Linux) is needed to run GNE under 
          UNIX environments.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a name="Documentation"></a>Documentation</h2>
      <p>This documentation is for GNE 0.49. If you are using the CVS version, 
        it is recommended that you download <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/">doxygen</a> 
        and generate the docs using the supplied doxygen.cfg file. The Rational 
        Rose stuff is offline for now as it is hard to maintain and totally sucks. 
        If anyone actually used it, email me and I'll put it back up.</p>
