							<p><font color=#6600CC><b>
						 Moderator</b></font>: Welcome to today's Live Expert Q&amp;A 
with James Foxall, vice president of Omaha, Nebraska-based Tigerpaw Software 
(www.tigerpawsoftware.com) and author of "MCSD in a Nutshell: The Visual Basic 
Exams" published by O'Reilly &amp; Associates. James will be answering your 
questions about the MCSD Visual Basic exams. Here is the first 
question. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 ehurley50296</b></font>: Should I get certified in just one exam 
and become an MCP, or go for my full MCSD? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: That really depends on your personal 
goals. Getting certified in a single exam, say the Visual Basic Desktop exam, 
does get you the MCP certification and will help demonstrate to an employer that 
you know something about the topic. If your company wants to become a solution 
provider, I believe the current requirements are that you employ 2 MCPs, so that 
may be enough. To see the real benefits in job opportunities and money however, 
you'll want to get your MCSD. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 mtripp576284</b></font>: Should I take the Visual Basic 6 exams, or 
wait for Visual Basic.net? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I'd take the Visual Basic 6 exams. First 
of all, .Net probably won't ship at least until the fall of 2001, and Microsoft 
is notorious for new exams trailing product releases by many months. So, I 
wouldn't even expect to see a VB.Net exam until 2002. I could be wrong, of 
course, but this is my suspicion. Also, if you've played at all with .Net, 
you're probably very aware of how much has changed; it's almost a new language 
rather than a new version of the Visual Basic we're all familiar with. 
Consequently, you'll have a HUGE learning curve to get over before taking the 
new exams. If Microsoft continues making the exams more difficult, as they've 
done with the Solutions Architecture exam, I would count on the .Net exams being 
TOUGH. I would leverage what you currently know and get certified 
now. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 ssimpson791869</b></font>: I still work with DAO rather than ADO. 
Will I be able to pass the ADO questions with my DAO experience?< 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: Personally, my database background is 
also DAO. Since I still do a lot of Jet work, DAO makes much more sense than ADO 
for me. However, ADO is the focus of the database questions on the exam. ADO is 
actually considerably different than DAO in many respects. I wouldn't go into 
the exam only knowing DAO and expect to do well on the ADO questions. O'reilly 
has posted the database chapter from my MCSD In a Nutshell book on their website 
at <A 
href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/mcsdnut/chapter/ch07.html">http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/mcsdnut/chapter/ch07.html</A>
In this chapter, you'll find everything you need to know to pass the ADO 
questions on the exams. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 hrhsoleil249845</b></font>: Will I really make more money as an 
MCSD? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: All of the studies I've seen, and my 
personal experience, say YES. I received a call a few weeks ago from a 
headhunter that had a few programmers he was trying to place. He said they were 
looking to get in the 60s, but I said I wanted someone with their MCSD 
certification. I was told that *IF* I could find one, I should expect to pay 
more in the mid 80s. I think that's a pretty big jump. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 bvigil550960</b></font>: I have been working with Visual Basic 
since version 3. Do I need to worry about studying that much for the 
exams? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I'd say yes. One of the points I try to 
make in my book "MCSD in a Nutshell" is that most VB developers specialize in a 
few areas of VB. Few, if any, utilize all of VB's features and create all of the 
possible components that VB allows us to build. Back when the VB 3 exam came 
out, you were tested on coding ability - designing a loop, use If...Then, etc. 
Now, the exams focus almost exclusively on Microsoft technologies, and deploying 
solutions. The exams have a fairly high failure rate for first time takers, and 
you have to pay money to take them. I'd say it's more than a good investment to 
devote some time preparing for the exams. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 dtart28270</b></font>: Would it be best to study from books or to 
take a course? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: This one's really up to you. Personally, 
I think you should buy my book but I'm rather biased! If you really work with VB 
for a living, supplementing your studying with a good book and a Transcender 
test is probably the way to go. The classes can get very expensive, and you may 
or may not get a good instructor. If you're not good at self-studying, or you're 
not as familiar with VB as you'd like to be, a class may be the way to 
go. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 kguglielmo48536</b></font>: Were there any questions on the exams 
that stand out in your mind as areas that you were especially unprepared 
for? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: There was one question that I thought was 
ridiculous. It asked what was the default RecordsetType property of a data 
control. I use the dang thing all the time (only for binding data grids), and I 
couldn't remember it. I mean, who really cares? When you put it on the form, you 
set the property as needed. I though that was akin to asking what the default 
Height of a combo box property is. It just goes to show that you can never 
anticipate all of what you'll find on the exams. Oh, the default value is 
Dynaset, for those of you who care. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 paulgillin908599</b></font>: If I only take one Visual Basic exam, 
which would you recommend? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: Take the Desktop exam 70-176, not the 
Distributed exam 70-175. The course numbers are somewhat misleading in that 
you'd think you should read the lower exam number first. However, the Desktop 
exam is a bit easier, and is more like the Visual Basic 5 exam. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 ashish.hosalkar376753</b></font>: What is the proper way of 
studying for the MCSD exam? Where should one start studying from? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: This entirely depends on you, your 
preferred way to learn, and your experience. First, take a look at the 
objectives fo the exam at <A 
href="http://www.microsoft.com/mcp">http://www.microsoft.com/mcp</A>, and see 
how comfortable you feel with the material. I would then recommend you get a 
good book or two (MCSD In a Nutshell is an excellent study guide), and also buy 
Transcender's prep test. If you feel that you need more, that's when I'd really 
start looking at classroon training. If you go the classroom route, make sure 
you get a reputable training center and instructor; a certified testing facility 
would be best. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 bvigil963428</b></font>: I don't use the Package and Deployment 
wizard that comes with Visual Basic, I use InstallShield. I see that both exams 
ask questions on packing and deploying. Can I get by with my knowledge of 
InstallShield? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: In short, no. Personally, I use WISE, and 
I hate the package and deployment tools that come with Visual Basic. 
Unfortunately, there are a LOT of questions on using the wizard on BOTH exams. 
This was the biggest surprise for me. I couldn't believe how many questions on 
this came up on the Desktop exam; I would have thought those questions were more 
suited to the Distributed exam. Make sure you ABSOLUTELY understand packaging 
and deploying using VB's wizard, including understanding the text files used by 
the wizard and dependency files. This is why I wrote such a large chapter on 
packaging and deploying in my Nutshell book; there are a LOT of questions about 
this on both exams. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 bvigil508218</b></font>: What do you think of brain-dump 
sites? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: Mixed feelings. They seem like an easy 
way to learn about the exams. I'm uncomfortable with the idea of people getting 
to read the questions and answers before hand (that's sometimes called cheating 
<G>). However, I've found that most of the questions are worded incorrectly, and 
you absolutely can't trust the answers that you read on the site. Also, there 
seems to be much more info on MCSE than MCSD on brain dump sites. At most, you 
can use a brain-dump site to get a feel for the types of questions that may be 
asked, but I wouldn't expect to pass an exam strictly by studying a brain-dump 
site. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 mcohodas499437</b></font>: How many MTS questions are on the 
Distributed Applications exam? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: More than I cared for! Seriously though, 
there are a few MTS questions but not a lot. You need to understand how MTS 
relates to DCOM, how to distribute MTS packages, how security works, how to 
install MTS, and how to work with Roles. If you don't use MTS (and a lot of 
people don't) you should learn about MTS before taking the exams. The chances of 
you guessing the answer correctly on an MTS question is pretty low. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 jerry985473</b></font>: Where can I find free sample tests for 
exams 70-175 or 70-176? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: Good question. Microsoft has a web page 
with links to certfified testing providers that offer free practice tests. The 
link is: <A 
href="http://www.microsoft.com/trainingandservices/default.asp?PageID=mcp&amp;PageCall=practicetests&amp;SubSite=examinfo">http://www.microsoft.com/trainingandservices/default.asp?PageID=mcp&amp;PageCall=practicetests&amp;SubSite=examinfo</A> 
Please understand that this doesn't include all test providers, such as my 
favorite: Transcender. I can't tell you how comprehensive they are because I 
haven't used them (recently). 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 arnie695360</b></font>: James, In the pre-interview discussion, you 
seemed to be quite down on Insructor led training. As a MCT, I think that I have 
a significant 'value add' to bring in the clasroom, and I find that many 
developers appreciate that additional effort on my part. Could you elaborate on 
you comments that (to paraphrase) ' a developer should get all he needs from 
self study'. Personally, I think that that statement does a disservice to those 
whose primarly learning modality is ILT rather than self study. 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I certainly meant no disrespect to MCTs, 
and I know quite a few of them. My primary reasoning behind my comments was that 
an experienced developer that actually <USES>VB for a living 'should' be able to 
get what they need from good study material. However, as you pointed out, some 
people work better in a classroom environment. It is true that this can get 
rather costly, so for those wishing to do this they really need to evaluate 
their goals and own learning abilities. Also, some local colleges offer 
certification classes, but not all instructors are MCTs. This is where I really 
get annoyed. If I was going to pay money for a class, I would go to an 
MCT. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 jerry985473</b></font>: If exam 70-100 (Analyzing Requirements and 
Defining Solution Architectures) is the only exam you pass does that earn you an 
MCP status? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: Yes, that will get you your MCP. Be 
prepared though, it's a really tough test. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 kyle436155</b></font>: Are these exams like most of the Microsoft 
Certification Exams, if you know the information covered in the Transcender prep 
you will be will prepared for the exam? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: If you can pass the Transcender exams, 
you've got a really good shot at passing the real exams. I'm amazed at how close 
Transcender gets. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 arnie695360</b></font>: James, As a Consultant and Trainer, I am 
often dismayed at the lack of programming standards within an organization. 
Would you speak to the issue of coding standardization and the effects of 
project maintenance? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I'd REALLY love to! I wrote the book 
Practical Standards for Microsoft Visual Basic (for MS Press), so this is one of 
my pet subjects. I'll table this for a bit to focus on the MCSD questions, and 
come back to it if there's time. If not, please send me an email and I'll be 
happy to discuss this. For what-it's-worth, I'm also talking with SearchVB about 
doing a chat specifically on coding and development standards. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 amesd395910</b></font>: In what order should we take the 
tests? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I highly recommend that you take the 
Desktop exam (70-176) before you take the Distributed exam (70-175). The 
Distributed exam is sort of an extension of the Desktop exam, in my 
opinion. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 sandhujps552845</b></font>: When is the VB 5.0 exam going to 
expire? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: The Visual Basic 5 exam (exam 70-165) is 
scheduled to be retired on December 31st of this year. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 rnguyen792202</b></font>: For the 70-176 exam how much of MTS is 
covered? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: There are no MTS questions on 70-176. You 
will, however, find a number of MTS questions on exam 70-175. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 jerry985473</b></font>: I have been in the IT industry for over 10 
years but with no certs. Since I am now unemployed I am not sure which cert to 
go after first. My choices are CCNA, MCSE, MCSD. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I would say this depends on your current 
set of skills. I can't say much about the Novell side. On the Microsoft side, I 
guess it depends on what you want to do. MCSE requires many more exams than the 
MCSD, and also sets you up for a different career track. If you just need 
certification and you don't really care which one you get, you can probably get 
the MCSD much more quickly. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 sandhujps552845</b></font>: I am currently being paid very low in 
my company. How can MCSD help me get a good raise and how because I won't be 
having much experience. Does just the certification helps? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: All of the published reports say that you 
make more with an MCSD, and my personal experience seems to confirm that. Having 
an MCSD shows that you have a core set of knowledge. Notice I didn't say skills. 
Knowing and doing are two different things. Experience plays a part in the 
skills building, but the certification shows you have the knowledge to implement 
the technologies. I think that's worth quite a bit. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 kbirdi973307</b></font>: Which pactice exam questions you would 
recommend : Measureup Inc. or Self Test Software Inc. or else ? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I personally have never used the two that 
you mention here; I've always used Transcender. It turns out the Transcender is 
a sponser of this chat, which I'm very happy to hear. Please be aware that I've 
been saying good things about them for quite some time, even in my MCSD In a 
Nutshell Book, so their sponsorship has nothing to do with my comments. I took 
the Transcender practice test before taking the Solutions Architecture exam, and 
I can honestly say that I'm not sure that I would have passed with it! I've been 
doing this for a number of years, but the test for Solutions Architecture is a 
difficult test, and just understanding how to answer the questions is a big part 
of passing it. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 Galvare31885</b></font>: How similar are the VB Desktop and VB 
Distributed exams and does it make sense to take them one after the 
other? 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: You'd be VERY surprised to see how much 
overlap exists on these exams. Take the Desktop exam (70-176) first, then the 
Distributed (70-175). You'll need to know MTS and programming ADO on the 
Distributed exam. Take a look at the requirements at <A 
href="http://www.microsoft.com/mcp">www.microsoft.com/mcp</A> and you'll see 
just how much is similar. If you've already passed the Distirubuted exam, the 
Desktop exam will probably go pretty smooth for you. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 kalensr565773</b></font>: I have been studying MS VB, and MS Visual 
C++, which route would you recomend I persue to get into an intermediate field 
soon, and how long do you think it would take, (1 - 2 years etc.) 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I'm strictly a VB guy, so I really can't 
say on C++. Which language do you like most? There seems to be plenty of jobs in 
both fields. You'll find in the future that the lines between C and VB will 
begin to blur. If you have a specific interested, such as developing multi-media 
software or something, you should find out what is the prefer language in that 
area. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 Meadowlark_A_Bradsher658506</b></font>: I am a veteran of the Sun 
Certified Java 2 Programmer, I took that and passed without classes or CD-Rom 
but just book study. Now I am heading into MCSD how should I compare the effort 
needed? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>:  Unfortunately, I can't offer you any 
advice because I haven't taken the exam you mention here. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 vbhuva421324</b></font>: What is Visual Basic.NET? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: Ah, I should have guessed this would come 
up. Visual Basic.Net is what was going to be Visual Basic 7. You'll be hearing 
about Visual Basic.Net and Visual Studio.Net a LOT in the future. It probably 
won't ship though until fall of 2001, and I wouldn't expect to see exams for it 
until early 2002. I could be wrong, but the exams usually follow product 
releases by many months. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 bkayma805648</b></font>: How realistic is it for a person with no 
workplace experience to pass the MCSD track? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: Probably not very realistic, though I 
won't say impossible. The exam for Visual Basic 3 was all about programming - 
could you write a For...Next loop or create a Select Case construct? Now, it's 
all about Microsoft technologies. If you're not actually building ActiveX 
components of some sort, you'll find a lot of the exam questions very confusing; 
you really should have some experiencing building COM based applications. If 
you're doing small projects on your own (which is how I started), chances you're 
not pushing the envelope on these technologies. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 jhilliard381886</b></font>:  No college degree in MIS or CS, 
however, 15 months of VB experience with SQL Server. Very comfortable with 
programming. How do I best prepare for exam? 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: Earlier in the list I answered a similar 
question. Please take a look at that answer and if you have more questions I'll 
be happy to try and help. For what-it's-worth, I don't think having or not 
having a degree makes a bit of difference when it comes to getting 
certified. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 drhughes52612</b></font>: Is there a "Boot Camp" I can go to and 
get certified in 1-2 weeks? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I've heard of boot camps, but I don't 
much about them specifically. John Smiley runs a bootcamp that I've heard very 
good things about. You can find out more about the bootcamp at 
www.johnsmiley.com. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 gbrozovich462692</b></font>: What is different or more difficult 
about the Soutions Architecture exam versus Microsoft exams of the 
past? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>:  The Solutions Architecture exam uses a 
new format. You don't get the straight-forward multiple choice questions. You 
get to build work-process charts, database structure trees, and a whole lot 
more. It's almost impossible to make a guess at an answer. I think Transcender 
offers a free trial test for this exam (but I'm not completely sure), which will 
give you an idea of how the exam is different. Personally, I think it's the 
toughest MS exam I've ever taken. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 kirma657879</b></font>: If currently headhunters are considering a 
4 year CS degree as equal to 1 year experience what benefits really does the 
whole MCSD offer over just being MCP, when you can add experience to compensate 
for the lacking of the MCSD. Plus when you take into account that bootcamps are 
just huge cramming sessions that can make someone squeak by not knowing anything 
about "real world development" 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: These are good points. But, you can now 
get an MCP for passing a single exam. Employers looking for skilled workers know 
that an MCP is not the same as an MCSD, where 4 exams were passed, nor an MCSE, 
where many more exams were passed. This really comes down to the person doing 
the hiring. Personally, I would look at someone with an MCP and think to myself, 
well, they're on the right track. However, an MCSD gets my attention right away. 
As far as the bootcamps go, you're right in that it's possible to get certified 
without really understanding all of the subject matter, which is why I took the 
approach that I did with my O'Reilly book. I think this will be less of a 
concern in the future, however, if Microsoft continues to modify their tests 
like they did with the Solutions Architecture exam; you'll have to know what 
you're doing to pass it. As you said, experience matters a LOT, and if you have 
that the MCSD may or may not be so important to you. For me, I like having it 
even though I don't necessarily need it at this time. People do seem to take you 
seriously when you have it. Plus, the logo looks good on a coffee 
mug!:) 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 dirmiger552624</b></font>:  How realistic will it be to try and take 
the VB6 exam with no outside study material? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: Anything is possible, but the odds aren't 
in your favor. Microsoft doesn't release figures anymore, but it's speculated 
that around half of the people that take an exam for the first time fail it, and 
you don't get your money back! It's VERY possible to really know your stuff, yet 
now be prepared to show that on the exams. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 t_bria170236</b></font>: How high is the demand for MCSDs as 
opposed to other certified professionals? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I honestly can't say for sure. I don't 
have an MCSE, so I really don't pay much attention to the certifications outside 
of MCSD - sorry. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 dirmiger552624</b></font>: In brief: what are the certification 
layers that MS offers VB programmers? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: Microsoft currently has listed the 
following certifications: MCP, MCP+Internet, MCP+Site Building, MCSD, MCSE, 
MCSD+Internet, MCDBA, an MCT. For information on specific tracks, check out <A 
href="http://www.microsoft.com/mcp">www.microsoft.com/mcp</A>. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 ccallis62855</b></font>: How similar are the two exams? (desktop 
&amp; enterprise) 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: If I had to give a figure, I'd say the 
overlap is around 80%. I'm boggled by how many Package and Deployment questions 
appear on both exams, for instance, when I think of this as more of a 
distributed topic. The Desktop exam asks you ADO, but mostly questions on the 
Data control and bound controls. On the distributed exam, you'll get more 
questions on programming ADO. This is often how the topics are treated, so that 
in some ways the Distributed exam seems like an extension to the Desktop 
exam. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 jerry985473</b></font>:  Since I am not familiar with DAO or ADO but 
I know ADO is newer, how much studying of DAO should I do to pass the 70-175 
exam? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: don't spend anytime on DAO, spend all of 
your time on ADO. As a matter of fact, O'Reilly made my Working with Data 
chapter available for free from their web site as a sample chapter. This has 
everything you need to know about ADO on both exams, and you can read it at: <A 
href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/mcsdnut/chapter/ch07.html">http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/mcsdnut/chapter/ch07.html</A> 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 rob_atkinson268600</b></font>: I am heavily familiar with VB5 but 
not yet with 6, will this hurt me in the exam? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: Many things are very similar between 5 
and 6, so you're not that far behind. Get yourself some study material 
though. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 jerry985473</b></font>: Does your book come with sample 
exams? 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: Yes, VERY comprehensive exams at the back 
of each chapter. Some chapters have over 30 questions in them. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 rnguyen792202</b></font>: Should one take the 70-100 exam before or 
after desktop and distributed? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I would recommend taking the VB exams 
first. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 jerry985473</b></font>: How much SQL knowledge is required to pass 
the Visual Basic exams? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: You'll have to have a working knowledge 
of building SQL statements for the Distributed exam (70-175). It's really not a 
problem for 70-176. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 Meadowlark_A_Bradsher658506</b></font>: Is Desktop more marketable 
than Distributed as a single exam? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I think that as a single exam, either is 
about equal. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 oamedina941624</b></font>: What is the largest block of material 
that the exam for VB covers? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I'm not sure about the largest, but I 
would say that the most surprisingly large number of questions on BOTH exams 
relate to using the Package and Deployment Wizard to create packages and 
distribued them. If you don't understand this very well, you'll be hurt on both 
exams. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 gillmore826148</b></font>: Of the people who don't pass, do you 
have any idea what topic areas they are failing in? 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I wish Microsoft would release this 
information, but they don't make it available. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 ccallis62855</b></font>: Are the tests revised to reflect more 
current SPs or releases of ADO? (if not which ADO release is the test based 
on?) 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: All exams are written against the current 
release of the product when the exam comes out; exams are not modified for 
service packs. This is important, because behavior may change in an application 
in a service pack, but the answer you give needs to relate to the product that 
was shipping when the exam was produced. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 RBEYEA899542</b></font>: Does you book cover the Solution Arch 
exam. If not, what do you recommend for self-study. 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: My book does not cover the Solutions 
Architecture exam. I have yet to see a book that does this exam justice. I 
personally used the Trascender practice exam, and I SWEAR by it. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 amy401131</b></font>: Are you familiar with the 'bootcamps', and if 
so, what do you think of them? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I mentioned earlier that I've heard of 
them but don't know much about them. I've heard good things about John Smiley's 
boot camps at www.johnsmiley.com. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 BBCritical627246</b></font>: Have you heard of leapit.com and what 
do you think of it? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: No, I haven't heard about that, 
sorry. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 celias291399</b></font>: What would the adantage be to by your 
book, "MCSD in a nutshell" compared to taking a course to get certified, or 
reading MS's books that come with Visual Studio? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: My book is unique in that I wrote the 
book like a textbook, and I only covered advanced material and technologies; you 
won't read about how to put controls on a form. My goal is to actually teach you 
the material, not just how to pass the exams. You should be more prepared for 
any type of question on a topic because you know the topic. For instance, the 
ActiveX control chapter is almost 100 pages, compare this to a dozen or so in 
other books. Although I can compare my book to other books, I can't compare it 
to courses because this is really apples and oranges and depends on how you like 
to learn. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 gwenda266330</b></font>: I agree with James about the class vs book 
thing. I'm a vba programmer and went to a 5-day class and quit after the 1st day 
as I was getting nothing out of it. I bought James' book. 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I really hope you find the book more 
useful to you. Please let me know either way. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 gwenda266330</b></font>: There is a free course on-line course for 
the desktop exam at leapit.com. I'm finding it useful. 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: You should take advantage of any free 
resource for preparing for the exams. I'll have to take a look at that so I can 
give a better answer in the future! :) 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 forbesn717202</b></font>: I've been disappointed in classroom 
training. I learn more from reading books and White papers. However, we've 
recently purchased some video training in some other areas that seem pretty 
good. Do you have any recommendations on online or video/CD training? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I've not personally seen video training 
for MCSD certification. I looked at doing one once, and really had no idea how 
I'd go about it. Make sure to talk with someone who has used a course before you 
buy it. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 gwenda266330</b></font>: What is the URL for one of these brain 
dump sites? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I don't know offhand, but you can find 
them through web searches. Be careful though, because the content is often 
suspect. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 BBCritical627246</b></font>: Is it true that transcenders are as 
close to the actual test as you can get 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I've not used any other products to 
compare it to, but yes, Trascender is unbelievably close to the real 
thing. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 mandeep.jassal403804</b></font>: How do you compare exam 70-100 to 
the other exams, specifically 70-176, in terms of difficulty? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I found exam 70-176 to be the most 
difficult exam because of the way in which it is administered. Your mileage may 
vary! 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 jerry985473</b></font>: Will I find your book at the local Super 
Crown? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I wish I knew! :) You can, however, find 
it at most bookstores, and on-line place such as SearchVB and 
Amazon.com. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 jkelly37879</b></font>:  Is the actual amount of experience that 
goes along with your MCSD also an important factor? 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>:  Personally, I think yes. The MCSD is 
pretty powerful on it's own, however, and has some weight against someone who 
has experience but no certification. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 Meadowlark_A_Bradsher658506</b></font>: SCJP (Sun Cert Java Pro) 
hasn't helped me much to get my first developer job. Will MCSD help a lot more 
to get entry level positions? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I've found that it helps 
tremendously. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 eddiebsd2662</b></font>: What do you recommend far as a good study 
books ? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: Well, of course I recommend MCSD In a 
Nutshell from O'Reilly, since I wrote it. Of course, I am biased, but I'm really 
proud of the book and I think it has a tremendous amount of value in it. I 
firmly believe that if you can pass all of the sample exams in the book (and I 
teach you what you need to now in the chapters), you'll be able to pass the real 
exams. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 vbhuva421324</b></font>: How do we prepare for 70-100 
exam 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: My personal recommendation is to buy 
Transcender's practice test and don't look back. I haven't seen a good book on 
this. I thought about writing one, but I honestly don't know if you could do the 
exam justice with a book. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 zerith27864</b></font>: I am using exam cram books for MCSD 
certification. What do you recommend instead of those books? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I've looked at most every Visual Basic 
certification book out there when I was writing my own. I can, without bias, 
recommend MCSD In A Nutshell over all others. What I recommend is budget some 
time at a local book store and sit down with a few books. Pick a topic that 
you're least comfortable with, and read or browse the chapters of each book on 
that subject. You should be able to tell quite quickly which is the book for 
you. 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 paulvec96241</b></font>: Is it better to take online courses or 
learn thru a CD?

sure. Sorry... 
						
							<p><font color=#0000ff><b>
						 sruffing623203</b></font>: Why do you recommend taking the Solution 
Architectures exam first? 
						
							<p><font color=#ff0000><b>
						 James_Foxall</b></font>: I actually recommend taking a Visual 
Basic exam first. The Solutions Architecture exam is a different beast, and it's 
probably best to get your feet wet with the 'traditional' exam format of a 
Visual Basic exam. Of course, your knowledge and experience disctate what's best 
for you.
