<strong>Abstract</strong>
<p>MHC tetramers are reagents used for direct <i>ex vivo</i> analysis of the frequency and 
phenotypes of antigen-specific T cells by flow cytometry.  The tetramer staining assay is 
purely physical-relying only upon the interaction between the tetramer reagent and T cell 
receptor clusters (and possibly co-receptors) on the surface of T cells-and reduces to an 
absolute minimum the <i>in vitro</i> manipulation of the sample before detection of the
antigen-specific population. The assay does not require <i>a priori</i> assumptions of the class
of  functional responses (<i>e.g</i>. cytokine profiles), and is therefore likely to provide the
most  complete method for detection of the magnitude of an antigen-specific response, while 
other methods can be applied to examine functional subsets within the total
antigen-specific  population. The method is extraordinarily robust, and can detect
antigen-specific  populations at frequencies as low as 1:5,000 CD8+ T cells (or
approximately 1:50,000  PBMC). All of these factors combined suggest that MHC tetramer
staining will play an  essential role in evaluation of T cell immune responses in future HIV
vaccine trials and in  patients infected with HIV.
<p>
<strong>Introduction</strong>
<p>
Until recently, most quantitative measurements of CD8+ T cell immune responses 
were made with either bulk <i>in vitro</i> stimulation with antigen followed by a chromium 
release assay to measure cell killing mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), or by adaptation 
of this basic procedure to determine the frequency of CTL precursors (CTLp), known as 
limiting dilution analysis (LDA). Because the chromium release assay is relatively 
insensitive and cannot detect many fewer than 2000 activated antigen specific CTL (<a href = "#ref34">McMichael & O'Callaghan, 1998</a>), both 
assays require <i>in vitro</i> stimulation  of cells taken directly <i> ex vivo</i> to expand the
antigen-specific population and to induce these cells to differentiate into CTL effector cells. The specific responses detected in bulk CTL
assays provide at best a semi-quantitative description of the immune response as  it actually exists <i> in
vivo</i>, while LDA is now known to underestimate the true frequency of  antigen-specific T cells by 10-500 fold.
This underestimate is a result of the very stringent   operational definition of a CTLp in the LDA; to be
detected in the assay, a single cell must  be induced to go through at least 11 rounds of cell division and the
progeny must develop  cytolytic functions (<a href = "#ref34">McMichael & O'Callaghan, 1998</a>).
<p>
 The bulk CTL assay and LDA may therefore be fairly said to reflect <i>in vitro</i> 
generated activities, and extrapolation of these results back to the state of the immune 
system <i>in vivo</i> is likely to be imprecise at best. There was therefore a strong need for 
assays-preferably simple and rapid-which could detect antigen-specific T cells at the 
single-cell level, directly <i>ex vivo</i>, without the need for <i>in vitro</i> expansion. The MHC 
tetramer assay  (<a href = "#ref2">Altman <i>et al.,</i> 1996</a>) (and a related method using MHC-Ig chimeras (<a href = "#ref20">Greten <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>; <a href = "#ref22">Hamad <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>)) was developed in response 
to this need. The method is complemented by two recently developed functional assays-antigen-specific intracellular cytokine staining (<a href = "#ref36">Murali-Krishna <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>) and the cytokine ELISpot assay (<a href = "#ref29">Lalvani <i>et al.,</i> 1997</a>) -that 
require <i>in vitro</i> stimulation <i> but not expansion</i> of an antigen-specific population prior to 
measurement.
<p>
Early attempts to identify antigen-specific T cells by flow cytometry focused on
systems where the repertoire of the T cell response was highly restricted.
These T cells could by identified by staining with antibodies against specific V-alpha
and V-beta T cell receptor (TCR) domains found in the responding population, in
conjunction with markers associated with antigen-experienced cells such as CD62L
and CD44 (<a href = "#ref32">McHeyzer-Williams & Davis, 1995</a>). We, and others, (<a href = "#ref13">Doherty </i> et
al</i>., 1996</a>), recognized that T cell responses using highly restricted
V-alpha V-beta repertoires were likely to be exceptional, and that a more
general approach to the problem was called for.  Instead of using anti-V region
antibodies as a surrogate marker for antigen-specificity, we (Michael
McHeyzer-Williams, Mark Davis, JDA) decided to try to stain T cells directly with
the antigen that they recognize, namely MHC/peptide complexes (<a href = "#ref33">McHeyzer-Williams
et al., 1996</a>). These efforts failed, and it soon became apparent why: in order to
maintain self-tolerance, the affinity of MHC/peptide for the TCR was too low to
use as an immunological staining reagent (<a href = "#ref30">Matsui <i> et al</i>., 1991</a>; <a href = "#ref31">Matsui <i>
et al</i>., 1994</a>). We then sought methods to add an avidity component to the
reagents, thereby decreasing the effective dissociation rate of the MHC/peptide
based stain.
<p>
To produce an MHC/peptide based stain with avidity for T cells, we turned to
streptavidin/biotin chemistry. Streptavidin (and the related avidin molecule) is
a protein composed of four identical subunits, each with an exceedingly strong
affinity for biotin. We reasoned that if we could biotinylate an MHC/peptide
complex and mix that preparation with streptavidin at a 4:1 molar ratio, we
would produce a tetrameric complex that might have strong avidity for
antigen-specific T cells. Our first attempts to use MHC/peptide complexes
chemically biotinylated by treatment with an N-hydroxy-succinamide (NHS)
derivative of biotin failed because the chemical modification was essentially
random and the biotin-MHC/peptide complexes therefore bound to streptavidin in
random orientations, some of which apparently could not interact with the TCR on
the surface of cells.
<p>
The key to producing a reagent that effectively stained specific T cells was to use a
method for attaching the biotin that was much more specific than chemical
biotinylation with NHS-biotin and that targeted the biotin residue to a site at the
carboxy-terminal end of the soluble domain of the MHC, as far away as possible from
the TCR interaction site. To accomplish this, we prepared MHC molecules that were
fused to a 15 amino acid peptide that is a substrate for biotinylation by an enzyme
found in <i> E. coli</i> known as BirA (<a href = "#ref43">Schatz, 1993</a>); we refer to this peptide as a
BSP, for BirA substrate peptide (<a href = "#ref2">Altman et al., 1996</a>). Following methods developed by
Garboczi <i> et al</i>., (Garboczi <i> et al</i>., 1992) we express the class I MHC heavy
chain-BSP fusion and
beta2 microglobulin subunits as insoluble, misfolded inclusion bodies in <i>
E.-coli</i>, and then mix them together under folding conditions <i>in vitro</i> in the
presence of a specific peptide ligand to produce MHC/peptide complexes. These molecules
are purified by size exclusion chromatography, enzymatically biotinylated using biotin,
MgATP  and the MHC-BSP/peptide complexes as substrates for the BirA enzyme (available
from Avidity, Denver CO), and purified again on high resolution anion exchange columns
(<a href = "#ref2">Altman <i> et al</i>., 1996</a>). The biotinylated MHC/peptide complexes are then mixed with
fluorescently labeled streptavidin at a 4:1 molar ratio to produce MHC tetramers, as
shown in Figure 1.

ovals, biotin residues are shown in  gray squares, the BirA substrate peptide is

<p>
 MHC tetramers provide a tool for measurement of a scalar quantity, the frequency 
of an antigen-specific T cell population.  We were initially concerned that tetramer staining 
might fail to detect a significant  fraction of T cells during both acute and chronic immune 
responses due to down regulation of the TCR in response to stimulation of the T cell with 
antigen <i>in vivo</i> (<a href = "#ref48">Valitutti <i>et al.,</i> 1995</a>), or that MHC tetramers might fail to stain T cells with low-but still 
functionally relevant-avidity for antigen. Two arguments can be advanced to allay these 
fears. First, there are no examples where the frequency of antigen-specific T cells 
determined by functional assays exceeds the frequency determined by tetramer staining, 
suggesting that MHC tetramers give a complete accounting of the T cell immune responses 
for the appropriate MHC/peptide combination. Second, the sheer magnitude of the acute 
immune response that is detectable by tetramer staining suggests that the fraction of specific 
cells not detected with the tetramer must be very low. Two examples suffice. During the 
acute immune response to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in BALB/c mice, 
55% of all CD8+ splenocytes are stained with the L<sup>d</sup>/NP118 tetramer (<a href = "#ref36">Murali-Krishna <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>), while during the 
acute primary human immune response to Epstein Barr Virus, up to 44% of all circulating 
CD8+ PBL were stained with an HLA-B8 tetramer containing a peptide from the EBV lytic phase protein BZLF1, HLA-B8/RAK (<a href = "#ref8">Callan <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>), and almost all of these express high levels 
of CD38, suggesting that they are highly activated.
<p>
 Distinct subsets are found within the population defined by tetramer staining, which 
might be described by a <i> phenotypic matrix</i>. The dimensionality of this matrix is 
indeterminate and can be quite large. For example, one dimension can be assigned for the 
expression level of each cell surface marker of interest, such as CD62L, CD45RA, CD38, 
etc. Separate dimensions might also be assigned for functional activities within the total 
population. Examples might include subsets which score as CTLp in LDA or cells which 
can be induced to secrete cytokines after short term <i>in vitro</i> stimulation. Ironically, it is 
difficult to assess the distribution of the most familiar functional activity attributed to CD8+ 
T cells, namely their cytolytic function, as CTL activity is commonly measured for a 
population of cells and few investigators even attempt to measure CTL activity at the single 
cell level.
<p>
 In order to obtain a more precise quantitative measurement of T cell immune 
responses with MHC tetramers, a price has to be paid. In contrast to measurements with 
bulk CTL assays or LDA, detection of T cell immune responses with tetramers requires 
precise knowledge of the optimal T cell epitope and its restriction element. When working 
with outbred populations (<i> e.g</i>. rhesus macaques or human subjects), it is therefore 
necessary to obtain medium-to-high resolution MHC typing information before suitable 
reagents can be selected or newly prepared; it is not yet clear if tetramers prepared with one 
MHC subtype (<i> e.g</i>. HLA-A*0201) will cross-react with T cells generated in responses to 
individuals with closely related subtypes (<i> e.g</i>. other HLA-A2 subtypes). In addition, in 
vitro folding of the MHC/peptide complexes is not tolerant of extensions or truncations of 
the optimal peptide ligand. The tetramer assay is therefore not suited to the early stages of 
investigation of the breadth of a T cell immune response. And although it is theoretically 
possible to use MHC tetramers to test motif-based predictions of CTL epitopes, the 
ELISpot or intracellular cytokine staining assays are much better suited to the task of 
screening large numbers of candidate epitopes for  recognition by T cells. Finally, 
expression plasmids suitable for the preparation of MHC tetramers are available for only a 
limited number of human and rhesus macaque class I MHC alleles (constructs for all 
classical class I alleles in mice of the H-2b, d, and k haplotypes are available), although the 
constructs are easy to prepare this is not expected to be a serious limitation in the near 
future.
<p>
 Assuming that acquisition of reagents is not a factor, the tetramer assay is the most 
rapid and direct method for determining the magnitude of a T cell response. In contrast to 
the ELISpot assay, the antigen-specific cells are easily counted by a computer (although 
semi-automated image processing of ELISpot plates may soon be available). Unlike the 
ELISpot assay, the tetramer method does not require accurate counts of the number of input 
cells, or separate measurements to determine the fraction of the total population that is 
represented by CD8+ T cells. These advantages also apply to the intracellular cytokine 
staining, but that method is significantly more labor intensive than the tetramer staining 
method, which may be a decisive disadvantage in evaluation of large scale vaccine trials. 
On the other hand, both cytokine assays do provide important functional data that is not 
available when only the tetramer assay is employed.
<p>
 Most-but not all (<a href = "#ref33">McHeyzer-Williams <i>et al.,</i> 1996</a>; <a href = "#ref11">Crawford <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>; <a href = "#ref21">Gutgemann <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>; <a href = "#ref22">Hamad <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>)-of the work with multimeric MHC molecules has focused on 
CD8+ T cells which recognize peptides bound to class I MHC molecules. This is because 
simple and efficient protocols have been developed for producing class I MHC/peptide 
complexes from subunits produced in E. coli, and the basic protocol can be applied to 
nearly every classical class I MHC allele without modification. In contrast, although several 
expression systems have been described for soluble class II MHC (<a href = "#ref50">Wettstein <i>et al.,</i> 1991</a>; <a href = "#ref47">Stern & Wiley, 1992</a>; <a href = "#ref3">Altman <i>et al.,</i> 1993</a>; <a href = "#ref27">Kozono <i>et al.,</i> 1994</a>; <a href = "#ref25">Kalandadze <i>et al.,</i> 1996</a>; <a href = "#ref22">Hamad <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>; <a href = "#ref44">Scott <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>), expression of soluble 
class II MHC appears to vary from allele to allele, and to increase the stability of the 
molecules, most investigators expressing class II MHC are now following the lead of 
Kappler and colleagues  (<a href = "#ref27">Kozono <i>et al.,</i> 1994</a>) and are preparing expression constructs with the peptide ligand 
covalently attached to the beta chain of the class II molecule, limiting the general applicability 
of any individual expression construct. 
In the remainder of this review, we will focus on features of MHC tetramer analysis 
and results that are most relevant to the study of immune responses to HIV, and to the 
development of an HIV vaccine.

<strong>Magnitude of T Cell Immune Responses</strong>
<P>
With rare exception (<a href = "#ref5">Borrow <i>et al.,</i> 1997</a>), measured frequencies of HIV-specific CTLp do not exceed 
1:1000, yet data existed suggesting that the true frequency of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells 
was in many cases significantly greater than this number. First, there is the frequent 
observation of direct <i> ex vivo</i>  CTL activity in PBMC from a high percentage of
HIV-infected patients suggesting HIV-specific CTL at frequencies approaching 1:100 per
CD8+ T cell (<a href = "#ref18">Gotch <i>et al.,</i> 1990</a>). This was confirmed by estimation of the frequency
of an HIV-specific T  cell clone in PBMC using molecular methods to estimate the
frequency of TCR transcripts  containing a CDR3 sequence from a well characterized CTL
clone (<a href = "#ref35">Moss <i>et al.,</i> 1995</a>). It was these data which  first led us to apply the
tetramer technology to immune responses against HIV (<a href = "#ref2">Altman <i>et al.,</i> 1996</a>).
Tetramer  staining has confirmed that in chronically infected, drug naive patients,
the frequency of  HIV-specific CD8+ T cells can be commonly found in the 1-4% range
(<a href = "#ref37">Ogg <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>; <a href = "#ref58">Wilson <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>; <a href = "#ref38">Ogg <i>et al.,</i> 1999</a>).
<p>
 Ogg <i> et al</i>., have reported that there is a positive correlation between the frequency of 
tetramer staining cells and direct <i> ex vivo</i> lytic activity (<a href = "#ref37">Ogg <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>), suggesting that the tetramers provide 
an accurate count of the frequency of circulating effector CTL (CTLe). However, our data 
from studies of CD8+ T cell responses in mice suggests that this result should be interpreted 
with caution. First, we and others have found that it is in general not possible to detect 
IFN-gamma production by antigen-specific T cells-even when they are sampled at the peak of an 
acute immune response-without stimulating the cells <i>in vitro</i> with peptide (<a href = "#ref16">Flynn <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>; <a href = "#ref36">Murali-Krishna <i>et al.,</i>1998</a>)  or 
PMA/ionomycin  (<a href = "#ref17">Gallimore <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>) This result might itself be an <i>in vitro</i> artifact, but at a very minimum, it 
does suggest that at least one effector phenotype-cytokine secretion-may be rapidly 
reversed without cell death. Second, we have found that infection of LCMV-immune mice with 
wild type vaccinia did not alter the total number of LCMV-specific CD8+ splenocytes-and 
in fact decreased their frequency due to expansion of vaccinia-specific cells-but did 
increase the direct <i> ex vivo</i> CTL activity against targets presenting LCMV antigens. This 
suggests that there is a significant population of LCMV-specific cells that are not effectors 
before infection with the heterologous vaccinia, and that are then "activated" in a bystander 
fashion to become effectors. Finally, we have recently found that chronic infection 
of CD4-deficient mice with LCMV can lead to induction of unresponsiveness in a sizable 
population of LCMV-specific CD8+ T cells identified by tetramer staining (<a href = "#ref52">Zajac <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>), a result that has 
significant implications for the character of the CD8+ T cell response during chronic 
infection with HIV (<a href = "#ref24">Kalams & Walker, 1998</a>). Development of an assay to detect cytolytic function at the single-cell 
level would greatly contribute to a resolution of this controversy.
<p>
 A more important result from the paper by Ogg <i> et al</i>., was the observation of a 
highly significant inverse correlation between the frequency of HLA-A2/gag or A2/gag + 
A2/pol tetramer positive cells in fresh peripheral blood and the viral load (<a href = "#ref37">Ogg <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>). These data 
strongly suggest that HIV-specific CD8+ T cells play an important role in the control of 
HIV infection, although it remains difficult to determine which effector functions of the 
specific CD8+ population are most responsible. Given the importance of this result, it is 
essential that it be confirmed in patients making immune responses that are restricted by 
HLA alleles other than HLA-A*0201. One factor which may complicate this experiment is 
the possibility that the responses that are detected by tetramer staining may not always be 
the dominant ones in every individual sharing that HLA allele. This points to one of the 
limitations of the tetramer technique-tetramer staining provides precise measurements of a 
very specific response, while revealing nothing about responses that are specific for 
additional epitopes in the same virus.
<p>
 Tetramer analyses of acute immune responses to HIV in infected humans have not 
been published, but existing data suggest that the acute immune response against HIV may 
be similar in magnitude to the acute response seen against other systemic infections such as 
LCMV in the mouse (<a href = "#ref36">Murali-Krishna <i>et al.,</i>1998</a>) and EBV in humans (<a href = "#ref8">Callan <i>et al.,</i>1998</a>).  First, there are often large expansions of CD8+ 
T cells with a restricted V-beta repertoire seen during the acute phase of HIV infection (<a href = "#ref39">Pantaleo <i>et al.,</i>1994</a>), similar 
to the restricted V-beta expansions seen following acute EBV infection (<a href = "#ref7">Callan <i>et al.,</i>1996</a>). Second, Borrow and 
colleagues used limiting dilution analysis to measure a monospecific acute immune 
response against  HIV at a frequency of 1:15 PBMC.
<p>
 Obtaining a detailed analysis of the kinetics of the acute HIV-specific CD8+ T cell 
response in humans is difficult because of the uncertainty in determining the time of 
infection.  Analysis of the CD8+ T cell immune response following infection of rhesus 
macaques with SIV or chimeric SHIV will undoubtedly be a useful model for studying 
acute responses to immunodeficiency viruses (<a href = "#ref42">Reimann <i>et al.,</i>1994</a>). MHC tetramer technology has been used to 
measure the magnitude of the CD8+ T cell response to the Mamu-A*01-restricted response 
to the SIVgag-p11C(C-M) epitope (<a href = "#ref15">Evans <i>et al.,</i>1997</a>) in A*01+ macaques chronically infected with SIVmac 
251 (<a href = "#ref28">Kuroda <i>et al.,</i>1998</a>).  In three chronically infected animals, the frequency 
of cells staining with the Mamu-A*01/p11C(C-M) tetramer ranged from 0.9-10.3% of 
fresh CD3+CD8-alpha-beta+ T cells in PBMC, even while the frequency of CTLp with the same specificity 
measured by LDA never exceeded 1:4000 PBMC (Kuroda <i>et al.,</i>1998). Even more exciting were the results
in animals vaccinated with a recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) expressing the SIV gag and pol genes
(<a href = "#ref45">Seth et al, 1998</a>). All Mamu-A*01+ animals (n=4) had Mamu-A*01/p11C(C-M) tetramer binding T cells 10 days
after a second vaccination with the  recombinant MVA, with frequencies ranging from 0.6-4.9% of all CD8
antibody positive T cells in  PBMC (<a href = "#ref45">Seth <i>et al.,</i>1998</a>). This result suggests that MHC tetramers will be
an extremely valuable tool for  measuring vaccine induced responses, even when the recombinant vaccine is a
replication-defective virus (<a href = "#ref9">Carroll & Moss, 1997</a>; <a href = "#ref45">Seth <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>).
<p>
 The kinetics of the CD8+ T cell immune response in rhesus macaques to SIV is 
expected to vary with the strain of virus used and with the route of infection. We have 
begun to use Mamu-A*01/p11C(C-M) tetramers to measure immune responses in animals 
infected intravenously with SIVmac Delta3 (<a href = "#ref12">Desrosiers 1992</a>), SHIV89.6 (<a href = "#ref41">Reimann <i>et al.,</i> 1996b</a>), SHIV89.6P (<a href = "#ref40">Reimann <i>et al.,</i> 1996a</a>), as well as animals 
infected intrarectally with SIVmac 239 or SIVmac 251 (Altman  <i>et al.,</i> unpublished). 
Preliminary results suggest that, as expected (<a href = "#ref42">Reimann <i>et al.,</i> 1994</a>), the peak of the acute immune response 
following intravenous infection occurs 2-3 weeks post infection, and that responses against the 
most attenuated strains (<i> e.g</i>. SIVmac Delta3) tend to be the weakest, with Mamu-A*01/p11C(C-M) tetramer binding cells peaking at levels
between 0.6-1% of CD3+CD8+ T cells.
<p>
 Extensions of these initial studies in the rhesus macaque model are currently limited 
by the small number of well characterized HIV or SIV epitopes and their restricting MHC 
alleles in rhesus macaques (<a href = "#ref10">Charini & Letvin, 1997</a>). The MHC-related problems are being addressed by the 
development powerful molecular typing methods (D. Watkins, personal communication) 
and the establishment of breeding colonies of MHC-defined animals. At the same time, 
more epitopes will be characterized using MHC-peptide binding motif based approaches (<a href = "#ref1">Allen <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>) 
and classical eptiope mapping approaches starting with recombinant vaccinia viruses, as 
well as the application of new methods for detection of CD8+ T cell responses in fresh 
PBMC samples by stimulation of cytokine production by libraries of overlapping peptides (<a href = "#ref26">Kern <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>).
<p>
<strong>Longitudinal analyses</strong>
<p>
An extensive natural history study of the frequency and phenotype of MHC 
tetramer-positive T cells following infection with HIV or SIV has not yet appeared. Given 
the current standard of care, such studies will almost certainly be done retrospectively, 
using frozen samples from an established cohort such as the Multicenter AIDS Cohort 
Study (MACS). Several labs have shown that tetramer staining works well on frozen cells (<a href = "#ref37">Ogg <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>), 
suggesting that the results of such studies may be regarded with confidence.
<p>
 The most interesting longitudinal analyses that have appeared so far have examined 
the frequencies and phenotypes of HIV-specific, tetramer-positive cells following viral load 
reduction with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (<a href = "#ref37">Ogg <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>; <a href = "#ref38">Ogg <i>et al.,</i> 1999</a>), complementing previous 
work examining virological and immunological responses to perturbation of an established 
steady state (<a href = "#ref23">Ho <i>et al.,</i> 1995</a>; <a href = "#ref49">Wei <i>et al.,</i> 1995</a>). Viral loads for all patients in this cohort were suppressed below the limits of 
detection throughout the course of the study.  Immediately following initiation of HAART, 
the frequency of tetramer binding CD8+ cells fluctuates rapidly, probably due to 
redistribution of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells from secondary lymphoid organs to the 
peripheral blood (<a href = "#ref38">Ogg <i>et al.,</i> 1999</a>), reminiscent of previously observed fluctuations in total CD8+ T cells 
observed following initiation of HAART in some patients (<a href = "#ref4">Autran <i>et al.,</i> 1997</a>). After this initial phase, there is 
a lengthy phase in which the frequency of tetramer-binding cells decays exponentially, with 
a median half life of 45 days (<a href = "#ref38">Ogg <i>et al.,</i> 1999</a>). In one patient, the frequency of tetramer positive cells 
declined from 2.75% of CD8+ T cells at the start of therapy to 0.47% 18 months later. The 
decay in the frequency of tetramer binding cells is much more gradual than the decay seen 
after resolution of acute infection with LCMV in a mouse model (<a href = "#ref36">Murali-Krishna <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>), where the virus is cleared 
by 8 days post-infection, and the total number of antigen-specific cells reaches a steady 
level by day 30 that is maintained for at least one year. The difference may reflect different 
lifespans of memory T cells in the two species, or it is possible that the decay of HIV-specific cells after
suppression of viral loads to undetectable levels is balanced by  stimulation of the antigen-specific population
by an unidentified reservoir of HIV-infected  cells. It will be interesting to one day compare the rate of decay
of HIV-specific CD8+ T  cells after initiation of HAART with the decline of an antigen-specific population after 
resolution of an acute infection by a virus that does not persist.
<p>
<strong>Phenotypic analysis</strong>
<p>
While MHC tetramer analysis is purely a physical assay, analysis of the phenotypes 
of the tetramer binding cells may suggest something of their function <i>in vivo</i> (<a href = "#ref2">Altman <i>et al.,</i> 1996</a>). A large 
number of antibodies against cell surface markers have been used to further analyze the 
phenotype of antigen-specific cells. Almost by definition, if a population of CD8+ T cells is 
detected by tetramer staining, that population must be ``antigen-experienced'' because the 
frequency of antigen-specific cells in naive subjects is too low to be detected by tetramer 
staining (<a href = "#ref37">Ogg <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>; <a href = "#ref45">Seth <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>). Almost invariably, the tetramer positive cells express high levels of the cell 
adhesion molecule CD11a. In our hands, tetramer positive cells almost always express low 
levels of the lymph node homing receptor CD62L, although a substantial fraction of EBV-specific CD8+ T cells in
some patients with acute infectious mononucleosis (AIM) retained  the same high-level expression of CD62L normally
associated with naive T cells (<a href = "#ref8">Callan <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>). In the early phase  of most immune responses, the tetramer positive cells are
CD45RO+ and negative for the  reciprocal marker CD45RA, but over time tetramer positive cells with the CD45RO- 
CD45RA+ phenotype associated with naive cells do accumulate (<a href = "#ref8">Callan <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>) (Altman  <i>et al.,</i> 
unpublished). The patterns of expression of CD28, a costimulatory molecule that is a 
ligand for B7-family molecules found on antigen presenting cells, remain poorly 
understood. Naive T cells are thought to express high levels of CD28, and the large 
number of CD28- CD8+ T cells which accumulated during development of HIV disease 
have been observed to have shortened telomeres, suggesting that the population has already gone through many rounds of
cell division and reached a state of replicative senescence (<a href = "#ref14">Effros <i>et al.,</i> 1996</a>). 
Consistent with this observation, Callan  <i>et al.,</i> have observed that in  one individual, the 
fraction of antigen-specific CD28- cells increases with the increase in frequency of the cells 
which bind a distinct tetramer (<a href = "#ref8">Callan <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>). On the other hand, we have shown that HIV-specific, CD8+ 
CD28- tetramer+ cells can usually be induced to proliferate <i>in vitro</i> (<a href = "#ref19">Gray <i> et al</i>., 1999</a>).
<p>
 The two most interesting phenotyping markers that have been examined are HLA-DR and CD38, because these
molecules are thought to be the best surrogate markers for the  activation status of a CD8+ T cell; of the two,
CD38 expression on tetramer positive cells  has been analyzed in more detail (<a href = "#ref8">Callan <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>; <a href = "#ref37">Ogg <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>; <a href = "#ref38">Ogg <i>et al.,</i> 1999</a>). CD38 expression on tetramer
positive cells appears to  correlate with antigen levels <i> in vivo</i>. During acute EBV infection, nearly all
tetramer  positive cells are CD38+, while 3 years after resolution of the acute infection, only 10% of 
tetramer positive cells remains CD38+. In HIV-infected patients, suppression of viral loads 
following initiation of HAART not only causes a decline in humans in the total frequency of tetramer 
positive, HIV-specific CD8+ T cells, but it also  causes a reduction in the levels of CD38 
expressed on those tetramer positive cells which remain (<a href = "#ref37">Ogg <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>; <a href = "#ref38">Ogg <i>et al.,</i> 1999</a>). When cells from chronically 
HIV-infected patients are stimulated with peptide antigen for 1-2 weeks <i> in vitro</i>, the 
expanded tetramer population is strongly CD38+, and efficient killing by the cultured cells 
is observed (<a href = "#ref19">Gray <i> et al</i>., 1999</a>).
<p>
 In addition to using MHC tetramers to examine the phenotype of antigen-specific 
cells, it has also been possible to costain antigen-specific CD8+ T cells with MHC tetramers 
and antibodies against TCR V-beta families in both mouse models (<a href = "#ref6">Busch <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>; <a href = "#ref46">Sourdive <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>) and in HIV-infected 
humans (<a href = "#ref51">Wilson <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>). This was initially surprising, since the tetramer and the V-beta antibody are binding 
to the same protein domain, and competition for binding sites might have been expected. 
On the other hand, the tetramer should bind to the most variable portion of the TCR, 
focusing on the CDR3 regions, while TCR V-beta antibodies should recognize features that are 
conserved on all T cells expressing that particular V-beta segment. Costaining with MHC 
tetramers and V-beta antibodies has already proven extremely valuable for analyzing the 
specificity of T cells in individuals with large V-beta expansions (<a href = "#ref7">Callan <i>et al.,</i> 1996</a>; <a href = "#ref8">Callan <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>; <a href = "#ref51">Wilson <i>et al.,</i>1998</a>).
<p>
<strong>Prospects for vaccines</strong>
<p>
MHC tetramers are ideally suited for the analysis of vaccine induced responses, 
provided that the CD8+ T cell responses induced by the vaccine are strong enough. The 
sequences of the HIV antigens delivered by almost any vaccine should be well known, and 
it is therefore certain that a vaccinated individual-expressing a known HLA allele-will 
have been exposed to a well characterized epitope; this is in contrast to the analysis of HIV-specific T cell
responses in infected patients, some of whom may have been infected with a  strain of virus that does not
contain the epitope of interest.  In addition, the tetramer assay  is extremely rapid and therefore might be
incorporated into the routine analysis of even  large scale phase III clinical trials, providing the HLA typing
information is available. As  noted above, an actual candidate vaccine-recombinant MVA expressing HIV or SIV 
antigens-has already been shown to induce CD8+ T cell responses that are easily 
detectable with tetramers. If it becomes clear that HIV-specific CD8+ T cells are an 
important correlate of protection, the responses induced by the MVA vectors may in the 
future serve as a standard against which other immunogens are measured. It is already clear 
that these vectors are capable of inducing acute CD8+ T cell immune responses that are 
equal or greater in magnitude to those induced by strains of live attenuated SIV  (Altman
<i>et al.,</i> unpublished). It remains to be seen if other experimental vaccines,
including naked DNA or recombinant fowl pox vectors are also capable of
inducing tetramer-detectable  immune responses, or how these strategies might best be combined.
<p>
<strong.Summary and Future Questions</strong>
<p>
MHC tetramer technology has now reached a stage of maturity where it is clear that 
reagents can be engineered to detect CD8+ T cell immune responses to nearly any antigen of 
interest, and that these reagents will be specific and have minimal cross-reactivity. Among 
the questions that will concern readers of this volume are the following. How can we best 
use the database of defined CTL epitopes as a guide for preparing new reagents to analyze 
HIV-specific responses in infected patients and in vaccinees? How robust are the responses 
against epitopes listed in this database? How often can we account for failure to respond to 
a previously characterized epitope through analysis of the viral sequence, <i>i.e</i>. by 
demonstrating that non-responders were never (or are not now) exposed to that epitope? 
And how do responses against one epitope affect the generation of responses against a 
second epitope? How does the particular combination of immune response genes (<i>i.e</i>. HLA 
alleles) in the host affect the response to HIV or any other pathogen? These are complicated 
questions, but they have important implications for the development of vaccines, and 
application of the tetramer technology should greatly facilitate the search for answers to 
these questions.
