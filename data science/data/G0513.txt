Abstract
<p>
We present new aperture photoelectric photometry in U, B, V, R and I
for 50 southern low-luminosity early-type galaxies (LLE). Asymptotic magnitude
and mean surface brightness within the effective aperture are derived
from fits to r1/4 growth curves and colours have been reduced
at the effective radius for 154 galaxies (106 LLE and 48 comparison galaxies).
A morphological and structural analysis of the LLE sample, based on ESO-LV
image data base shows that: (i) The average flattening of these galaxies
is high: (b/a) = 0.58.
(ii) The sample can be split in four main categories (plus two secondary).
First, the galaxies wearing r1/4 photometric profile along the two principal
axes which have an average of (b/a) = 0.7 (32% of the sample). Second, 
the galaxies presenting r1/4 profile <i> only </i> along the minor axis,
these galaxies are generally flatter: (b/a) = 0.4, and show significant
positive a4 coefficient, they probably contain a disk (21%).
Third, the galaxies with irregular ("bumpy") photometric profile
which appear to be of the latest type in our sample (t = -2) (25%).
And fourth, the galaxies wearing a profile intermediate between r1/4
and exponential along major and minor axes (10%).
(iii) There is no correlation between the morphological type
for t less than 3 and any of the structural
and geometrical properties investigated. (iv) Only a few galaxies
show a boxy isophote shape while a greater fraction shows disky isophotes.
