    <!--/NOEDIT-->The space experiments were performed on ancient
    organisms called cyanobacteria, formerly known as blue-green
    algae or blue-green bacteria. As a family, these organisms form
    the fundamental basis of the entire marine food web and are often
    called &quot;the grass of the sea.&quot; These early ancestors
    of modern plant cells (chloroplasts) were the first oxygenic
    organisms to convert light to energy on Earth. The cyanobacterium
    protein used in the space investigation, from the species <EM>Synechococcus
    elongatus</EM>, is found abundantly today. It represents more
    than half of the total biomass productivity in all open ocean

    Burning carbon fuel such as oil and coal produces most of this
    excess carbon dioxide. This process currently supplies much of
    the world's power needs, but the fuel reserves are rapidly running
    out. Nonpolluting alternative fuel sources are being developed
    to take the place of oil and coal. In the 1970s, solar power
    - a clean and unlimited power source - seemed to be the most
    promising alternative. Harnessing the power of the Sun to power
    the Earth, however, has been plagued with difficulties. To generate
    a lot of power, you need extremely large solar panels. And what
    do you do for power when the sun sets?<BR>

    </TABLE>The Space Shuttle investigation is trying to discover
    what features of photosynthetic proteins allow for solar energy
    conversion. While humans have only been developing solar power
    technology for a few decades, plants have been evolving for billions
    of years to perfect their photosynthetic technique. By studying
    how plants accomplish this remarkable feat, scientists hope to
    someday also develop systems that use light as a power source.
    Identifying and studying characteristics of the protein's metabolism
    may someday also be used for applications in pollution prevention
    and environmental clean-ups.</TD>

    </FONT></B><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Many essential biology
    questions depend on knowing the structure of proteins and enzymes.
    By charting their shape, scientists can determine how the molecules
    work. But these molecules may also change shape when performing
    important functions, like carrying oxygen in blood hemoglobin.
    </FONT>In photosynthesis, there are many energy producing conversion
    steps from sunlight to plant development and growth.<BR>
<BR>
    Some estimates suggest that human biology depends on the action
    of nearly half a million different enzymes and proteins. But
    we only have a three-dimensional picture of shape and function
    for fewer than 1 in 100 of these complex chemicals. Since 1984,
    the Space Shuttle has carried experiments to determine the structures
    of large, biologically important molecules. This research has
    compiled results for a host of human diseases ranging from insulin
    for the control of diabetes, to the reverse transcriptase enzyme
    that, when blocked, inhibits HIV infection.<BR>

    the complex array of nucleic acids in DNA (coded as the letters

    </FONT></B>A good illustration of how photosynthesis leads to
    environmental balance is the terrarium. A sealed jar of carefully
    balanced photosynthesizing organisms can sustain themselves for
    long periods without exposure to outside material nutrients or
    gases. Such a microbial terrarium can keep its ecological balance
    nearly indefinitely without any care or maintenance. <BR>
<BR>
    The secret to this self-sufficiency is that green or purple photosynthesizing
    organisms generate their own source of life from the energy in
    light. This ability allows them to divide and multiply in a stable
    manner. NASA's &quot;Life on the Edge&quot; project tests some
    of the limits to this remarkable behavior. By closing several
    green biomass mixtures into sealed jars, these organisms are
    frozen within a deep freezer to a frigid -80 deg C (-112 deg
    F), temperatures exceeding the coldest winter weather in Antarctica
    (-44.5 deg C, or -48 deg F). Afterwards, the jars are thawed
    and opened, and scientists then grow the organisms in a culture
    to assess their viability. Healthy growing ecosystems have been
