<p>The Save Our Seats campaign held it's latest public meeting at the Companions Club, Leazes Park Road, Newcastle upon Tyne on Monday 8th November.  Chaired by Frank Gilmore and attended by over 100 fans, affected, non-affected, bond holders and non-bond holders the meeting was addressed by a number of speakers.</p>
<p><br>
Jane Duffy spoke of  Save Our Seats' continued aim to ensure that the club reverse it's decision to relocate the 4,000 season ticket holders affected by the club's decision.  Emphasis was made that the message must be sent out that the campaign is not about bond holders or the affected 4,000 but is for all fans.  All bond holders whose presumed right to their seat for 10 years has effectively been torn up by the club;  those currently with season tickets who could be affected in the coming years as the club further expand the corporate elements in the ground or sooner as they also appear prepared to offer affected fans alternative seats as long as they are not currently occupied by a bond holder, anywhere in the ground;  those fans on the waiting list as the club are restricting the number of new season tickets available to them; and probably most importantly the next generation of fans who are being prevented from getting the chance to attend on a regular basis.<br>
</p>
<p>Details of the current campaign fund were also given.  In just over a week since the fund was launched over £8,000 has been raised.  Donation points manned by members of the SOS group were set up around the ground at the last two matches as well as collections being made around the city centre before the Everton game.<br>
</p>
<p>£30,000 is required to fund the legal action taken on behalf of all fans by four bond holders and collection boxes will be placed in clubs and pubs around Tyneside to continue the fund raising effort.  Donations can also be sent by cheque or postal order made payable to "SAVE OUR SEATS" to ;<br>

<p>Additionally names of bond holders in support of the action, whether affected or not, were called for to support the legal action.  These can be sent to the above address, e-mailed to

</p>
<p>An appearance in court is planned this week to obtain an injunction against the club preventing them from any further action until the legal action is resolved.<br>
</p>
<p>The meeting also heard from Independent Manchester United Supporters
Association chief Andy Walsh who gave details of how fans of the Old Trafford club fought the attempted takeover from Sky.   He explained how the fans organised their campaign and gave valuable suggestions and ideas for the current SOS campaign.   He emphasised that the message must be loud and clear to the people running the clubs that they belong to the fans and that the fans voice must be heard and listened to.  The balance has been tipped too far in favour of the corporate market place and the time has come for all fans to take concerted action.
Kevin Miles spoke of the confidence of the lawyers acting on behalf of the
campaign.<!--mstheme--></font><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table></body>
