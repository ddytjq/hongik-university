<h1>ARTICLE VI - FIELD EVENTS</h1>

<p><u>Comment</u>: Field events is a general term used to
classify individual disc sport events, namely: accuracy,
distance, maximum time aloft (hereinafter referred to as
&quot;MTA&quot;), throw, run and catch (hereinafter referred to
as &quot;TRC&quot;), and self-caught flight (hereinafter referred
to as &quot;SCF&quot;). The common link among the field events is
the competitive measurement of a particular basic skill. Accuracy
measures a player's ability to consistently throw a disc through
a specified target. Distance measures how far a player can throw
a disc. MTA measures the length of time a player's throw is in
the air. TRC measures the distance a player can throw a disc and
catch the throw, prior to the throw hitting the ground, and SCF
combines the events of MTA and TRC.</p>

            <li><a name="601.01"></a>601.01 <u>General</u>: The
                playing field for field events may have any
                surface, although well-trimmed grass is
                suggested, which is essentially level, free of
                obstructions and/or holes, and affords reasonable
                player safety. </li>
            <li><a name="601.02"></a>601.02 <u>Obstructions</u>:
                If there are permanent and predictable obstacles
                which may affect the completion of a throw,
                throwing sites should be located to minimize
                potential problems. Once these obstructions have
                been noted by the head or site judge, however, no
                re-throw will be granted if the obstructions come
                into play. Designated spectator areas shall be
                considered an obstruction. </li>
            <li><a name="601.03"></a>601.03 <u>Accuracy</u>: The
                playing area in accuracy shall consist of seven
                throwing stations, set at varying distances and
                angles from the target; said stations being
                clearly marked by foul lines which consist of a
                front line and perpendicular sidelines, both of
                which are 120 cm in length and between 5 cm and
                10 cm in width. Small, flexible cones should be
                used to mark the front corners. The location of
                the throwing stations is determined by the target
                itself and the lateral extension of its plane.
                See Figures 6.1 and 6.2. <img src="image6_1.gif"

                    <li>A. <i>Straight-Ahead Throwing Stations</i>:
                        There are three straight-ahead throwing
                        stations, with respective distances of
                        13.5 m, 22.5 m, and 31.5 m from the
                        target. The midpoint of these stations
                        shall be on the imaginary line that makes
                        a perpendicular intersection of the
                        target plane at the midpoint of the
                        target. </li>
                    <li>B. <i>Left-Angle Stations</i>: There are
                        two left-angle stations which are located
                        to the player's left of the target; one
                        station 13.5 m from the target and at an
                        angle to the target such that a line
                        drawn from the midpoint of the front foul
                        line of the station and intersecting the
                        target plane at a perpendicular angle
                        will be 4.5 m in length; and one station
                        located 22.5 m from the target along the
                        same angle as the 4.5 m line, such that a
                        line drawn from the midpoint of the front
                        foul line of the station and intersecting
                        the target plane at a perpendicular angle
                        shall be 7.5 m in length. </li>
                    <li>C. <i>Right-Angle Stations</i>: There are
                        two right-angle stations which are
                        located to the player's right of the
                        target; one station 13.5 m from the
                        target and at an angle to the target such
                        that a line drawn from the midpoint of
                        the front foul line of the station and
                        intersecting the target plane at a
                        perpendicular angle will be 4.5 m in
                        length; and one station located 22.5 m
                        from the target along the same angle as
                        the 4.5 m line, such that a line drawn
                        from the midpoint of the front foul line
                        of the station and intersecting the
                        target plane at a perpendicular angle
                        shall be 7.5 m in length. </li>
                    <li>D. <i>Optional Field of Play</i>: The
                        playing area may also use a moveable
                        target to create the correct angle
                        stations. Positioning for the target
                        should be painted on the ground. See
                        Figure 6.3. <img src="image6_3.gif"

            <li><a name="601.04"></a>601.04 <u>Distance</u>: The
                playing area in distance shall be of sufficient
                size to permit the entire course of the disc
                flights to be contained within its perimeter,
                essentially level to insure an accurate
                measurement, and in an area which permits an
                unblocked windflow. The layout of the field shall
                be such that throws may be made with the
                prevailing wind. There shall be five throwing
                sites, each marked with foul lines which consist
                of a 3 m front line and perpendicular sidelines
                which are 3 m to 15 m in length. These lines
                shall be between 5 cm and 10 cm in width. Small,
                flexible cones should be used to mark the front
                corners of each site. At least 6 m of additional
                space shall be provided between each throwing
                site. See Figure 6.4. <img src="image6_4.gif"

                for MTA shall be of sufficient size to permit the
                entire course of the disc flights to be contained
                within its perimeter, and essentially level. No
                field markings or other delineations or

                        be measured from the midpoint of the
                        front foul line to the center of the disc
                        at its point of impact. All throws shall
                        be measured to the nearest cm. </li>

                        the option of counting the throw and
                        having it measured from the point of
                        interference, or immediately choosing to

                    <li>A. <i>Play</i>: A player shall attempt to
                        throw the disc in such a fashion that the
                        disc remains airborne for as long as
                        possible, before catching the disc
                        himself. Each player shall make five
                        attempts in each round. </li>
                    <li>B. <i>Discs</i>: A player shall provide

                        per <a href="#602.01">section 602.01</a>.
                        It is advised that an additional disc be
                        available in the event a disc is lost or
                        becomes unsuitable for use. </li>
                    <li>C. <i>Timing of the Throw</i>: The timing
                        of the flight of the throw shall be
                        measured from the instant of release
                        until the instant the disc is initially
                        touched in the catching attempt. Time
                        shall be calculated to the nearest
                        one-hundredth of a second. The player's
                        time for a throw shall be the median
                        (middle) time rating of three time
                        ratings received from the measurement
                        crew. In the event that only two times
                        are recorded by the measurement crew, the
                        back-up timer's result shall be used as
                        the third rating. If no backup is
                        available, the two ratings shall be
                        averaged. If only one valid time is
                        available, a re-throw is necessary. No
                        time shall be recorded for unsuccessful
                        throws. </li>
                    <li>D. <i>Time of Play</i>: A player shall
                        release a throw within 15 seconds after
                        receiving a signal to throw from the site
                        judge. Any throw released after the
                        expiration of the 15 second period shall
                        receive a score of zero. </li>
                    <li>E. <i>Catch</i>: A catch shall be deemed
                        valid when the throw is caught and
                        controlled in one hand by the player,
                        without the disc simultaneously touching
                        any other part of the player's body and
                        prior to the disc touching the ground.
                        The player is permitted to touch the disc
                        an unlimited number of times before the
                        catch is made, as long as he or she only
                        touches the disc with one part of his or
                        her body at a time. In the event the disc
                        touches the ground simultaneously with
                        the instant the catch is made, the catch
                        shall be valid. A player shall be in full
                        control of the disc before he or she lets
                        it go, changes hands, or touches the disc
                        with another part of the body for the
                        catch to be valid. The validity of
                        questionable catches shall be announced
                        by the player, subject to review by the
                        event judges. </li>
                    <li>F. <i>Score</i>: The player's score shall
                        be the single best time recorded. </li>
                    <li>G. <i>Groupings</i>: To facilitate rapid
                        completion of the event, the players
                        shall be placed in groups of five for the
                        purpose of alternating the order of
                        throws. Each player makes one throw, then
                        the order is repeated until each player
                        has made his or her five throws in the
                        round. </li>
                    <li>H. <i>Starting Order</i>: In the first
                        round the starting order is decided by
                        some order of random distribution. In all
                        subsequent rounds, each player, in
                        descending order according to his or her
                        performance in the previous round, shall
                        be given his or her choice of throwing
                        order and site. If two or more players
                        have the same results in the previous
                        round, the order of choice in the current
                        round shall be decided by the disc
                        flipping method. <a

                        travels as far as possible before
                        catching the disc himself. Each player
                        shall make five attempts in each round. </li>

                        MTA, worth 55.28 points, would be added
                        to a 57.41-m TRC performance worth 57.41
