			<p>Many new procedures using bio- and gene-technology have been introduced in medicine since the human domain was defined by Article 24 novies of the BV in 1992. These new procedures must be regulated.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Pharmaceutical production: Research for the development and production of new drugs and vaccines, procedures of fermentation, gene-farming.</p></li>
				<li><p>Fundamental research in biomedicine (Investigations of incurable or grave diseases, diagnostics).</p></li>
				<li><p>Gene therapy.</p></li>
				<li><p>Transplantation medicine: Xenotransplantation, potentials of embryonal stem cells.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some legal foundations for these concerns are already in application today, others are included in the <a href="03">Gen-Lex Package</a> or in the nine projects of the IDAGEN-report, e.g. the <a href="http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/817_0/">Law on Food</a> or the <a href="http://www.admin.ch/bag/chemikal/gesetz/d/chemges.htm">Law on Chemical Products</a>. Nevertheless, some gaps in the legislation in the human domain remain to be filled. The main responsibility for these additional regulations lies with the <a href="http://www.admin.ch/bag/">BAG</a>.</p>

			<h2>Drugs Produced by Gene-Technology</h2>
			<p>At present cantonal laws control drugs and vaccines produced by gene-technology, i.e. the Intercantonal Agreement on the <a href="http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/c812_101.html">Control of Medicine (IKV)</a> as well as the <a href="http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/8/812.111.de.pdf">Ordinances on Immunological Products of the BAG</a> and <a href="http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/9/916.445.2.de.pdf">of the BVET</a>. All products must obey the <a href="http://www.uvek.admin.ch/doku/presse/1999/d/99082505.htm">Ordinance on Dissemination</a> and the regulations of the EU and, as a consequence of the Gen-Lex Package, they must be declared.</p>
			<p>In order to unify the various regulations a Federal Law on Drugs and Medicinal Products is being worked out (<a href="http://www.admin.ch/bag/heilmitt/gesetz/d/">Heilmittelgesetz, HMG</a>). This law will not only deal with the authorization of drugs and medicinal products but also with the evaluation of clinical studies. It will be implemented by the new <a href="http://www.admin.ch/bag/heilmitt/gesetz/d/botsch03.pdf">Swiss Institute on Medicine</a>. The EFBS and the EKAH will have consultative functions.</p>
			<p>Status:	At the moment the law is being discussed in parlamentary commissions.</p>

			<h2>Clinical Trials</h2>
			<p>Clinical trials are controlled by the <a href="http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/c812_101.html">IKV-Regulations</a> for Clinical Trials in Medicine or by the Ordinance on <a href="http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/8/818.124.1.de.pdf">Clinical Trials for Immunological Products</a>. The HMG, a federal law for the authorization of drugs and medicinal products which is being worked on at present, is to establish a comprehensive uniform regulation that will be supplemented by a compulsory registration of medicinal substances. The biological safety of gene therapy studies and of products obtained from GMOs will be examined by the EFBS.</p>

			<h2>Medically Supported Reproduction</h2>
			<p>When the popular initiative <a href="http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/pore/vi/vi241t.html">"For Reproduction Respecting Human Dignity" (FMF)</a> was launched after the introduction of Article 24 novies in the BV in 1992 (Article 119 today), the administration started working on a new Law on Medically Supported Reproduction (Fortpflanzungsmedizingesetz, FMedG) which could be considered to be an indirect counter-proposition to the initiative. This law prohibits the abusive utilisation of bio- and gene technology and donations of follicles or embryos. Contrary to the initiative it takes into account the positive aspects of advances in reproductive medicine, especially in the area of in vitro fertilization. The initiative was voted down on March 12, 2000.</p>
			<p>Status: The law will most likely be introduced in 2000. </p>

			<h2>Research on Human Beings</h2>
			<p>Today the legislation on the use of human beings in medical research is essentially concentrated in <a href="http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/101/a120.html">Article 120 of the BV</a>. The comprehensive Federal Law for Medical Research on Human Beings planned under the supervision of the BAG will protect human dignity, the individual personality and the family. Moreover, this law will fill the gaps in existing and new laws concerning the research on mentally disabled human beings and experiments using aborted embryos or fetuses during pregnancy.</p>
			<p>Status: The promulgation is planned for year 2001.</p>

			<h2>Genetic Examinations (for Research and Identification) of Human Beings</h2>
			<p>A committee of experts was asked by the Federal Police and Justice Department to work out a Law on Genetic Examinations of Human Beings. This federal law will ensure a uniform procedure for genetic examinations (for purposes of reseach and idenfication) which should protect a person's human dignity as well as his personality. It will also control the storage and reuse of genetic data to prevent discrimination, for instance by insurances. Examinations with the purpose of identification will be subject to approval and will only be performed in the context of criminal proceedings. Most likely the <a href="http://www.admin.ch/bag/">
			BAG</a> will issue the authorizations. A commission for genetic examinations on human beings will be created to assist the BAG in this task.</p>
			<p>Status:	The procedures of promulgation closed in 1999. The announcement and the draft of the law are expected beginning of 2001.</p>

			<h2>Transplantation of Organs, Tissues and Cells</h2>
			<p>At present transplantation medicine is controlled by <a href="http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/101/a119t.html">Article 119a of the BV</a> and by the <a href="http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/8/818.111.de.pdf">Federal Resolution on the Control of Blood, Blood Products and Transplants</a> and since May 1999 by the corresponding <a href="http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/c818_111_3.html">ordinance</a>. These include the protection from infections and the regulation of the trade with transplants. A <a href="http://www.admin.ch/bag/transpla/gesetz/d/">new Law on Transplantation</a> will be elaborated in order to deal with the many remaining open questions in transplantation medicine (definition of death, distribution of organs, etc.). This law will regulate common transplantation of human organs as well as xenotransplantations which are closely connected to the methods of biomedicine and gene technology.</p>
			<p>Status: The promulgation procedures have already been started.</p>
