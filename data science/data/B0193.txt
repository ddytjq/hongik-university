      The Chelsea will lend to anyone who is at least 18 years old. We will 
        not discriminate against you because of your colour, race, ethnic or national 
        origin, your sex or if you are disabled. However you will need to have 
        the right to reside and work in the UK for at least the duration of the 
        mortgage, be employed by a UK based business, be paid in &pound; sterling, 
        pay UK tax and be purchasing a property in the UK for your own occupation.</p>
					
      <p>Up to four people can be joined in an application although as a maximum 
        we will only take into account the income from three applicants. At least 
        one applicant needs to be working (either employed or self-employed) or 
        in receipt of a guaranteed income such as a pension</p>
					
      <p>You will need to have a good credit history, be able to prove your income 
        and that you have successfully maintained your other financial commitments. 
        Your application will be subject to a credit check.</p>

      The usual term is 25 years but your loan can be for any term from 5 years 
        to 40 years but should end on or before your normal retirement age. In 
        exceptional circumstances we may agree to extend the term up to your 75th 
        birthday if you are in receipt of income which we regard as guaranteed 
        and which we consider to be sufficient to service the loan. Loans past 
        normal retirement age (where available) are restricted to not more than 
        75% of the purchase price or value (whichever is the lower) of the property.</p>

      Chelsea believe in allowing you the freedom to choose which method you 
        would like to repay your mortgage and this method can be either Repayment 
        or Interest Only.</p>
					
      <p>With a Repayment mortgage you pay interest plus capital each month until, 
        by the end of the term, your mortgage is repaid.</p>
					
      <p>Alternatively you can make payments of interest only, The monthly payments 
        are lower than a repayment mortgage however, the amount you borrow remains 
        outstanding and will have to be repaid at the end of the mortgage term. 
        This may be done, for example, by linking your Interest Only mortgage 
        to an endowment assurance or personal pension plan. You can also repay 
        the amount borrowed from your own personal resources. It is your responsibility 
        to do this and you should also arrange life assurance to repay the loan 
        in the event of your death.</p>

        property. The Chelsea will not lend on studio flats, bedsits or converted

      The property will be valued by a valuer instructed by the Society. You 
        will receive a copy of the valuation report. However the valuation is 
        not a structural survey and this report may not reveal defects which are 
        important to you but are not important to us. You are therefore strongly 
        advised to obtain a more detailed report for your own use before you commit 
        to the purchase. If you would like our valuer to combine the valuation 
        with a more detailed report for you (i.e. a Homebuyers Report or a full 
        structural survey) this can be arranged for a fee.</p>
					
      <p>A copy of our Valuation Report will be sent to you, but without acceptance 
        of any liability on our part.</p>

        an existing mortgage you may be permitted to borrow more than your current
