      <P>The Cas A supernova remnant is a well known thorn in the side
      of astronomers that keeps raising awkward questions. Why didn't
      observers see Cas A explode more than 300 years ago? Where is
      the neutron star or black hole that most supernovae leave behind?
      Why is Cas A a source of cosmic titanium-44, a radioactive isotope
      of the metal prized by the aerospace industry? Scientists hope
      that Chandra will finally provide answers.</P>

      after Chandra's July 23, 1999, launch aboard Space Shuttle Columbia.</P>

      <P>&quot;Last Thursday night we pointed Chandra in the direction
      of Cas A,&quot; said Dr. Harvey Tananbaum, Director of the Smithsonian
      Astrophysical Observatory's Chandra X-ray Center in Cambridge,
      Mass., &quot;and this is what we saw. That's just a beautiful
      sight.&quot;</P>

      X-ray pictures taken by the German Roentgensatellit, or ROSAT,
      but with incredible amount of detail. A video of the Chandra
      team watching the Cas A image appear on computer screens shows
      amazement, awe, and wonder amidst clapping and shouts of joy.</P>

      <P><IMG SRC="images/cas_a/Leon_X1.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="200"

      director of astrophysics at NASA Headquarters. &quot;It works
      perfectly. It's meeting all of our objectives. The United States
      is back in charge of observational X-ray astronomy. We have the
      most powerful X-ray astronomy telescope in the world, and it's
      called Chandra.&quot;</P>

      <P>As the Cas A image appeared, scientists readily spotted a
      small point source just about at dead center.</P>

      <P>&quot;We think we may have found the neutron star&quot; that
      was expected to be at the center of the supernova remnant, Tananbaum
      said. One of the stunning aspects about the picture is that it
      shows this wealth of detail after 90 minutes of exposure whereas
      ROSAT - which made dozens of significant contributions to X-ray
      astronomy - took days to make its image.</P>

      <P>An early spectrum of Cas A shows strong lines emitted by silicon,
      sulfur, argon, calcium, and iron among other elements.</P>

      <P>&quot;This is the material that we're made of,&quot; said
      Dr. Martin Weisskopf the Chandra project scientist at NASA Marshall
      Space Flight Center. &quot;The silicon that makes up the mirrors
      of Chandra itself were made in these types of explosions.&quot;</P>

      <P>Chandra is not through with Cas A. Tananbaum said that more
      studies will follow, even as the telescopes calibration and verification
      tests are executed over the next four weeks, to see if the point
      source's spectrum, brightness, and time variation correspond
      with a neutron star.</P>

      <P>Finding a neutron star will solve one of the outstanding mysteries
      about Cas A and &quot;balance the books,&quot; Tananbaum said.</P>

      <P>Meanwhile, Weisskopf has nicknamed the object Leon X-1 in
      honor of Dr. Leon van Speybroeck, the Chandra telescope scientist.</P>

      <P><B><FONT SIZE="+3">C</FONT></B>assiopeia A - Cas A for short
      but known by several other names - is the remnant of a star that
      blew itself apart about 9,400 years ago. (Any astronomical event
      is history, but because of the time it take slight to travel
      across space, when it gets here it's news, so astronomers usually
      refer to the age of the object as it appears to us.) It was one
      of the first objects to be discovered when radio astronomy itself
      was discovered, and has been studied extensively across the spectrum
      up through gamma rays.</P>

      <P>Cas A has been discovered in bits and pieces since early astronomers
      apparently missed its debut in the mid-1600s. It is relatively
      close - only about 9,100 light years away - so it should have
      been bright enough to cause a stir when it appeared in the night
      sky. Sir John Flamsteed, Britain's Astronomer Royal, may have
      seen Cas A in 1670. If so, he misidentified it as a star and
      made no follow-up observations. No other sightings are known
      (an earlier, unrelated supernova was recorded in Cassiopeia in
      1572).</P>

      </TABLE>The shell has two components, the high-temperature blast
      wave, still plowing outward through the interstellar medium,
      and a low-temperature reverse shock traveling inward. On the
      western edge, Cas A plows into a molecular gas cloud. On the
      opposite side, a high-speed jet moves through relatively empty
      space.</P>

      <P>In addition to being the youngest supernova remnant in our
      galaxy, it's also quite extended, about 13 light years wide,
      more than four times the distance from the Sun to the nearest
      star, Alpha Centauri (3 light years). The shell's apparent diameter
      is 5 arc-minutes, about 1/6th the apparent diameter of the Moon.</P>

      <P>Cas A probably started as a Wolf-Rayet star with an initial
      mass 30 times that of our sun. Being a heavyweight doomed Cas
      A. It burned hot - with a surface temperature of 50,000 K (90,000
      deg. F), more than eight times hotter than the surface of our
      Sun- and fast. This blew off an intense solar wind that reduced
      Cas A's mass to about 10 solar masses by the time it was reduced
      to a suicide diet.

      fuel at their cores, they go on a fiery binge, burning the ash
      from one round of fusion into still heavier ash to be burned
      in a shorter, hotter cycle until only iron is left. Fusing iron
      nuclei into heavier atoms consumes rather than produces energy.
      Cas A's furnace turned off - perhaps even earlier, during silicon
      formation - and the star imploded. Heavier elements were produced
      by this inward rush and absorbing much of the energy, but not
      enough to keep the implosion from rebounding and blowing the
      star apart.</P>

      <P>What happened next is a bit of a mystery. While we tend to
      think of a supernova blowing outward in all directions, it can
      explode along the poles. A star's magnetic field becomes more
      compacted and intense as the outer layers collapse. This can
      control the star's blast so it acts like an armor-piercing charge
      that forms a high-speed jet.</P>

      <P>But that was in the past. All we are left with now is a bright,
      fragmented shell that is largely the result of Cas A overtaking
      its own solar wind and then running into the interstellar medium.
      What may look like empty space to us is actually peppered with
      pockets and wisps of gas and dust that will become the stuff
      of new planets in a few billion years.</P>

      continues that process.</P>

      <P>A real oddity is titanium 44 (a radioactive cousin of the
      prized aerospace metal). Cas A apparently has an unusual abundance
      of Ti-44 as compared to nickel 56, another product of nucleosynthesis
      in a star. The Compton Telescope aboard the Compton Gamma Ray
      Observatory has observed emission lines at 1.156 MeV, corresponding
      to scandium 44 decaying into calcium 44, the last step in titanium
      44's life cycle.</P>

      <P>If correct, the Ti-44 is direct probe of nuclear fusion at
      the heart of the doomed Cas A source, a sample of star stuff
      from just above the layers that formed the neutron star or black
      hole at the center of the Cas A remnant.</P>

      <P>If there one was left behind. One of the mysteries about Cas
      A is why no central object has yet been found for Cas A.</P>

      <P>Chandra may help answer this and other questions about Cas
      A. It certainly will provide much finer details about the more
      than 300 glowing knots of gas that make up the remnant, and help
      define just what Cas A's contribution will be to the makeup of
      future worlds.
