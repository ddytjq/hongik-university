<p> The standard VGA modes are all very well, but before long you are
likely to want a higher resolution, or perhaps one with more than 256
colors. This means switching to an SVGA mode, which stands for
Super-VGA, ie. better than what was possible on the original VGA
board. There are many hundreds of different and incompatible SVGA
cards on the market today, but you won't need to write special code
for each one because you can use the standard VESA interface
instead. This is a software API that was designed by the Video
Electronics Standards Association, and is usually implemented either
as a loadable TSR utility or as part of the BIOS ROM on your video
card.  VESA allows you to do things like setting graphics modes and
displaying images without needing to know the hardware details for
every graphics chipset: this is obviously a good thing if you want
your program to work across a range of different machines!</p>

<p> If you don't already have this, you should start by getting hold
of a copy of the VESA spec (see the links at the end of this file). A
lot of material from the official documentation will be repeated here,
but this is a beginners tutorial rather than a complete technical
reference so you will probably want to have the spec at hand for
reference.</p>

<p> All the VESA functions are accessed by calling int 0x10 with a
value of the form 0x4F?? in the AX register, where ?? represents the
specific function that you want to execute. They will return a value
of zero in AH if the call succeeds, or non-zero if there was an error.

<p> The first step is to make sure that a VESA driver is present, and
to retrieve a copy of the VESA information structure. This is defined
as:</p>

<pre>
   typedef struct VESA_INFO
   { 
      unsigned char  VESASignature[4]     __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned short VESAVersion          __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned long  OEMStringPtr         __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  Capabilities[4]      __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned long  VideoModePtr         __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned short TotalMemory          __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned short OemSoftwareRev       __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned long  OemVendorNamePtr     __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned long  OemProductNamePtr    __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned long  OemProductRevPtr     __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  Reserved[222]        __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  OemData[256]         __attribute__ ((packed));
   } VESA_INFO;
</pre>

<p>The <tt>__attribute__</tt> modifiers are needed to make
<tt>gcc</tt> pack the structure into the standard VESA layout, rather
than adding pad bytes between some of the fields like it would
normally do.</p>

<p> Having declared this structure, you can call VESA function 0x4F00
to fill it with information about the current driver. Because VESA was
designed as a real mode API for use by 16 bit programs, this data must
be transferred via a buffer in conventional memory with the
<tt>dosmemput()</tt> and <tt>dosmemget()</tt> functions: see the DPMI
chapter for details of this. The function below will copy the VESA
driver information into a global <tt>VESA_INFO</tt> structure,
returning zero on success or -1 if anything goes wrong (ie. no driver
is available).</p>

<pre>
   #include &lt;dpmi.h&gt;
   #include &lt;go32.h&gt;
   #include &lt;sys/farptr.h&gt;


   VESA_INFO vesa_info;


   int get_vesa_info()
   {
      __dpmi_regs r;
      long dosbuf;
      int c;

      /* use the conventional memory transfer buffer */
      dosbuf = __tb & 0xFFFFF;

      /* initialize the buffer to zero */
      for (c=0; c&lt;sizeof(VESA_INFO); c++)
	 _farpokeb(_dos_ds, dosbuf+c, 0);

      dosmemput("VBE2", 4, dosbuf);

      /* call the VESA function */
      r.x.ax = 0x4F00;
      r.x.di = dosbuf & 0xF;
      r.x.es = (dosbuf&gt;&gt;4) & 0xFFFF;
      __dpmi_int(0x10, &r);

      /* quit if there was an error */
      if (r.h.ah)
	 return -1;

      /* copy the resulting data into our structure */
      dosmemget(dosbuf, sizeof(VESA_INFO), &vesa_info);

      /* check that we got the right magic marker value */
      if (strncmp(vesa_info.VESASignature, "VESA", 4) != 0)
	 return -1;

      /* it worked! */
      return 0;
   }
</pre>

<p>After calling the <tt>get_vesa_info()</tt> function you may want to
examine a few of the values that it leaves in the vesa_info structure,
notably the <tt>VESAVersion</tt>, <tt>Capabilities</tt>, and
<tt>TotalMemory</tt> fields (see the VESA spec for details of
these). Assuming that this call has succeeded, the next step is to
work out which mode you want to use, and retrieve another information
structure that is specific to this mode. VESA can in theory support an
infinite variety of possible resolutions, but obviously most hardware
can only handle a few specific modes. By far the most common is the
640x480 resolution, but most cards can also handle sizes of 640x400,
800x600, and 1024x768, and many can go up as high as 1280x1024 and
1600x1200 as well as occasionally supporting low resolution modes like
320x240 and 360x400, and oddball sizes like 512x512. There are a few
standard mode numbers like 0x101 for the 640x480 256 color mode, and
you will see a lot of tutorials and code that use these fixed values,
but it is not a good idea to rely on them because the most recent
version of the VESA specification warns that they may change in the
future. This isn't a problem, though, because there is a perfectly
good way to check what modes are available at runtime, which also has
the advantage of letting your program support any strange modes that
the driver might provide on future or different hardware, even if you
didn't know about them when you wrote it.</p>

<p> Information about a particular mode can be obtained in a similar
way to the main VESA information block, but using function 0x4F01 with
a different structure, eg:</p>

<pre>
   typedef struct MODE_INFO
   {
      unsigned short ModeAttributes       __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  WinAAttributes       __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  WinBAttributes       __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned short WinGranularity       __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned short WinSize              __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned short WinASegment          __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned short WinBSegment          __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned long  WinFuncPtr           __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned short BytesPerScanLine     __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned short XResolution          __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned short YResolution          __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  XCharSize            __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  YCharSize            __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  NumberOfPlanes       __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  BitsPerPixel         __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  NumberOfBanks        __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  MemoryModel          __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  BankSize             __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  NumberOfImagePages   __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  Reserved_page        __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  RedMaskSize          __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  RedMaskPos           __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  GreenMaskSize        __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  GreenMaskPos         __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  BlueMaskSize         __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  BlueMaskPos          __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  ReservedMaskSize     __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  ReservedMaskPos      __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  DirectColorModeInfo  __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned long  PhysBasePtr          __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned long  OffScreenMemOffset   __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned short OffScreenMemSize     __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned char  Reserved[206]        __attribute__ ((packed));
   } MODE_INFO;


   MODE_INFO mode_info;


   int get_mode_info(int mode)
   {
      __dpmi_regs r;
      long dosbuf;
      int c;

      /* use the conventional memory transfer buffer */
      dosbuf = __tb & 0xFFFFF;

      /* initialize the buffer to zero */
      for (c=0; c&lt;sizeof(MODE_INFO); c++)
	 _farpokeb(_dos_ds, dosbuf+c, 0);

      /* call the VESA function */
      r.x.ax = 0x4F01;
      r.x.di = dosbuf & 0xF;
      r.x.es = (dosbuf&gt;&gt;4) & 0xFFFF;
      r.x.cx = mode;
      __dpmi_int(0x10, &r);

      /* quit if there was an error */
      if (r.h.ah)
	 return -1;

      /* copy the resulting data into our structure */
      dosmemget(dosbuf, sizeof(MODE_INFO), &mode_info);

      /* it worked! */
      return 0;
   }
</pre>

<p>This function is obviously only useful if you already know what
mode number you should pass as the parameter, but that information can
easily be obtained from the main VESA information block. This contains
a list of all the possible modes that are supported by the driver, so
you can write a little routine that will loop through all these modes,
retrieving information about each one in turn until it finds the one
that you are looking for. For example:</p>

<pre>
   int find_vesa_mode(int w, int h)
   {
      int mode_list[256];
      int number_of_modes;
      long mode_ptr;
      int c;

      /* check that the VESA driver exists, and get information about it */
      if (get_vesa_info() != 0)
	 return 0;

      /* convert the mode list pointer from seg:offset to a linear address */
      mode_ptr = ((vesa_info.VideoModePtr & 0xFFFF0000) >> 12) + 
		  (vesa_info.VideoModePtr & 0xFFFF);

      number_of_modes = 0;

      /* read the list of available modes */
      while (_farpeekw(_dos_ds, mode_ptr) != 0xFFFF) {
	 mode_list[number_of_modes] = _farpeekw(_dos_ds, mode_ptr);
	 number_of_modes++;
	 mode_ptr += 2;
      }

      /* scan through the list of modes looking for the one that we want */
      for (c=0; c&lt;number_of_modes; c++) {

	 /* get information about this mode */
	 if (get_mode_info(mode_list[c]) != 0)
	    continue;

	 /* check the flags field to make sure this is a color graphics mode,
	  * and that it is supported by the current hardware */
	 if ((mode_info.ModeAttributes & 0x19) != 0x19)
	    continue;

	 /* check that this mode is the right size */
	 if ((mode_info.XResolution != w) || (mode_info.YResolution != h))
	    continue;

	 /* check that there is only one color plane */
	 if (mode_info.NumberOfPlanes != 1)
	    continue;

	 /* check that it is a packed-pixel mode (other values are used for
	  * different memory layouts, eg. 6 for a truecolor resolution) */
	 if (mode_info.MemoryModel != 4)
	    continue;

	 /* check that this is an 8-bit (256 color) mode */
	 if (mode_info.BitsPerPixel != 8)
	    continue;

	 /* if it passed all those checks, this must be the mode we want! */
	 return mode_list[c];
      }

      /* oh dear, there was no mode matching the one we wanted! */
      return 0; 
   }
</pre>

<p>And at last, you are ready to actually select a VESA graphics mode
and start drawing things onto the screen! This is done by calling
function 0x4F02 with a mode number in the BX register, eg:</p>

<pre>
   int set_vesa_mode(int w, int h)
   {
      __dpmi_regs r;
      int mode_number;

      /* find the number for this mode */
      mode_number = find_vesa_mode(w, h);
      if (!mode_number)
	 return -1;

      /* call the VESA mode set function */
      r.x.ax = 0x4F02;
      r.x.bx = mode_number;
      __dpmi_int(0x10, &r);
      if (r.h.ah)
	 return -1;

      /* it worked! */
      return 0;
   }
</pre>

<p>The SVGA video memory is located at physical address 0xA0000, the
same as in mode 13h, but there is one small problem with this: there
simply isn't enough room for it all to fit there! The original DOS
memory map only included space for 64k of video memory between 0xA0000
and 0xB0000, which is fine for a 320x200 resolution but nowhere near
enough for a 640x480 screen (that takes up 300k of framebuffer space,
and higher resolutions need even more). The SVGA hardware designers
solved this problem by using a banked memory architecture, where the
64k VGA memory region is treated as a sliding window onto the larger
expanse of real video memory inside your card. To access an arbitrary
location on the SVGA screen you must first call VESA function 0x4F05
to tell it which bank you want to use, and then write to a memory
location within that bank. You can set the bank with the function:</p>

<pre>
   void set_vesa_bank(int bank_number)
   {
      __dpmi_regs r;

      r.x.ax = 0x4F05;
      r.x.bx = 0;
      r.x.dx = bank_number;
      __dpmi_int(0x10, &r);
   }
</pre>

<p>Using this, a simple <tt>putpixel</tt> function can be implemented as:</p>

<pre>
   void putpixel_vesa_640x480(int x, int y, int color)
   {
      int address = y*640+x;
      int bank_size = mode_info.WinGranularity*1024;
      int bank_number = address/bank_size;
      int bank_offset = address%bank_size;

      set_vesa_bank(bank_number);

      _farpokeb(_dos_ds, 0xA0000+bank_offset, color);
   }
</pre>

<p><em>Note:</em> Many VESA tutorials, and indeed a few actual
production programs, assume that the SVGA memory banks will always be
exactly 64k in size. This is true on about 95% of cards, but there is
some hardware with bank sizes of 4k or 16k, so the correct approach is
to read the bank size from the <tt>WinGranularity</tt> field of the mode
information structure as demonstrated above.</p>

<p> <em>Note 2:</em> The bank switch function is very slow! This
simplistic <tt>putpixel</tt> routine is far too inefficient to be
useful in real life. It can be improved by making the
<tt>set_vesa_bank()</tt> function only bother to change banks if the
new value is different to the previous one, and you should try to
optimize your more complex drawing functions to use the minimum
possible number of bank switches.</p>

<p> Because bank switching is so slow and awkward, it is often better
to do all your drawing onto a framebuffer array in regular memory, and
copy it across to the VESA screen in a single pass once the image is
complete. This can be done with a function along the lines of:</p>

<pre>
   void copy_to_vesa_screen(char *memory_buffer, int screen_size)
   {
      int bank_size = mode_info.WinSize*1024;
      int bank_granularity = mode_info.WinGranularity*1024;
      int bank_number = 0;
      int todo = screen_size;
      int copy_size;

      while (todo &gt; 0) {
	 /* select the appropriate bank */
	 set_vesa_bank(bank_number);

	 /* how much can we copy in one go? */
	 if (todo &gt; bank_size)
	    copy_size = bank_size;
	 else
	    copy_size = todo;

	 /* copy a bank of data to the screen */
	 dosmemput(memory_buffer, copy_size, 0xA0000);

	 /* move on to the next bank of data */
	 todo -= copy_size;
	 memory_buffer += copy_size;
	 bank_number += bank_size/bank_granularity;
      }
   }
</pre>

<p>The description of the bank switching mechanism given above is
actually a slight simplification of the true state of affairs, because
VESA supports two different banks (described as "windows" in the
spec), which can be configured in a variety of ways depending on the
hardware. Usually there will only be one bank which is used both for
reading and writing the video memory, but on some cards you may have
two windows using different address ranges (eg. one from 0xA0000 to
0xB0000 and another from 0xB0000 to 0xC0000, or two 32k chunks from
0xA0000 to 0xA8000 and 0xA8000 to 0xB0000), or you might have one
window for writing to the screen and a different one for reading from
it, which can be positioned independently of each other. You don't
need to worry about this when drawing onto the screen, as long as you
are careful to always use the <tt>WinSize</tt> and
<tt>WinGranularity</tt> values rather than assuming the banks will
always be 64k in size, but it is essential to check the window setup
before you try to read pixel values back from the display.  If the
bottom two bits in the <tt>mode_info.WinAAttributes</tt> field are
set, the first window is readable and you can proceed as
normal. Otherwise you will have to use the second window for your read
operations, which means changing the <tt>set_vesa_bank()</tt> function
to put a 1 in the BX register, and writing to
<tt>mode_info.WinBSegment*16</tt> rather than the default 0xA0000
address.</p>
