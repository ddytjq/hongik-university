<h2>3.6 MS-Windows applications and DJGPP</h2>

<p><em><strong>Q</strong>: Can I write MS-Windows applications with DJGPP?</em>

<br><p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Currently, you can only run DJGPP programs under Windows as DOS
apps (i.e. inside the DOS Box).  If you need to write true Windows apps,
you will have to use auxiliary tools or another compiler.  This section
lists some of the possibilities.

<p>RSXNTDJ is an add-on package for DJGPP which allows to develop Win32
programs using DJGPP development environment.  It is essentially a
cross-compiler targeted for Win32 (Windows 9X and NT) and Win32s
(Windows 3.X + Win32s) platforms<a rel=footnote href="faq25.html"><sup>6</sup></a>;
it supports DJGPP v2.x and includes debugging tools and an IDE. 
Beginning with version 1.60, RSXNTDJ is distributed under the terms of
the GNU license (previous versions needed to be registered for a small
fee if you wanted to develop commercial or shareware applications with
it).

<p>RSXNTDJ supports Win32 console, GUI, DLLs and bound programs (the latter
can be run on DOS under the RSX extender, as well as on Windows).  You
can download RSXNTDJ <a href="ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2tk/rsxntdj151.zip">via FTP</a>.  The latest
version of the RSX IDE (called <small>RSXIDE</small>) is available <a href="http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~rainer/">from Rainer Schnitker's home page</a>.  Rainer's home page is also
the place to look for the latest releases of RSXNTDJ, including beta
releases.

<p>RSXNTDJ version 1.31 was produced with GCC v2.7.2.1 and DJGPP v2.01.  If
you use it with later versions of GCC and DJGPP, it will need some
tweaking; it is best to upgrade to RSXNTDJ v1.5 or later.

<a href="mailto:jventer@writeme.com">Johan Venter</a> wrote a HOWTO document that
explains how to install and set up RSXNTDJ, and how to fix the various
problems present in the current RSXNTDJ distribution.  Make sure you
read the <a href="http://surf.to/rsxntdj">RSXNTDJ HOWTO</a>, before you try to install
the package on your own; it will save you hours of banging your head
against all kinds of weird problems, like missing files (due to
truncated file names), linker error messages, inability to link C<tt>++</tt>
programs, etc.

<p>In general, RSXNTDJ's support leaves a lot to be desired.  Some problems
take too long to fix, and response to user bug reports is slow.  Even
with the latest efforts by Johan Venter and others, you should expect to
spend some time and effort installing and using the package.  Another
problem is that you depend on Microsoft SDK for the header files, and
each new release of the SDK tends to break the patches to the header
files required by RSXNTDJ.

<p>These are disadvantages of RSXNTDJ with respect to other alternatives
(see below); the most significant advantage is that you can use the
entire DJGPP development environment.  By contrast, other alternatives
for free Win32 development usually provide less tools; in particular,
Mingw32 provides only a few basic tools (like Make and GDB) beyond the
compiler and Binutils.  As a result, people who work with Mingw32 tend
to use all kinds of different and subtly incompatible versions of
shells, Make, etc.  Cygwin has much more ports of GNU tools, but even
Cygwin tool-chain doesn't have such a rich set of development tools all
working together smoothly as DJGPP does.  (Of course, if you don't mind
developing with a minimal set of tools, this might not be a serious
consideration for you.)

<p>Here are some tips about RSXNTDJ:

<ul>
<li>The URL mentioned in the RSXNTDJ help file for the MS Platform SDK
header files might no longer be valid.  Microsoft tends to rearrange its
site frequently, and changes the SDK location in the process. 
Currently, you can find the SDK headers on the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkall.htm">Microsoft World Wide Web site</a>.  Note
that, whenever a new version of the SDK is released, the patches to
Windows header files supplied with RSXNTDJ are no longer valid.  You
might need to apply the patches manually if the <code>patch</code> utility
fails.

<p>There's an alternative to using patched MSSDK headers: <a href="http://www.acc.umu.se/~anorland/gnu-win32/w32api.html#download">Anders Norlander's WinAPI headers</a>.  These
headers can be used as a drop-in replacement for the RSXNTDJ headers,
and they include the functionality of Microsoft's headers.  Beginning
with version 1.5.1, the RSXNTDJ package includes a modified version of
Anders Norlander's headers as part of the distribution.

</p><li>Since RSXNTDJ is in essence a cross-compiled environment, its header
files and libraries can create conflicts with those supplied by DJGPP
(as part of <code>djdevNNN.zip</code> package).  Therefore, your best bet
would be to install RSXNTDJ in another directory, so that the headers
and libraries don't mix.  Make sure that when you compile DJGPP
programs, the DJGPP include directories are searched <strong>before</strong> the
RSXNTDJ ones, and when you compile RSXNTDJ programs, the RSXNTDJ include
directories are searched first.  Likewise, you should make sure the
compiler looks in the correct directories for libraries and the
<code>crt0.o</code> startup module.  When in doubt, add <code>-v</code> to the
compiler's command line to see which directories it searches and in
which order, and what libraries does it link in.

<p>One specific problems with conflicting headers is with the header
<code>function.h</code>.  Both DJGPP and RSXNTDJ have such a file, with
different contents.

</p><li>I'm also told that the <code>stdio.h</code> header supplied with RSXNTDJ
defines several inline functions with the <code>extern</code> qualifier, which
causes GCC to not compile them into the object file, and triggers
undefined references.  The solution is to define the <code>extern</code>
symbol to an empty string in one of the source files which includes the
<code>stdio.h</code> header.

<li>Add the directory where the pre-processor (<code>cpp.exe</code>) is kept to
the <code>PATH</code> environment variable, or copy the pre-processor into a
directory already on your <code>PATH</code>.  (Without this, the resource
compiler will not work.)

<li>Some people report that they needed to bump up the stack size using the
<code>pestack</code> utility, allegedly due to insufficient size of the
default stack.

<li>The version of linker <code>ld.exe</code> which comes with RSXNTDJ doesn't
print any message if you forget to link in libraries such as
<code>libcomct.a</code> and <code>libcomdl.a</code>.  Instead, the produced
executables will die with SIGSEGV when run.  Sometimes, forgetting to
<code>#include</code> <code>windows.h</code> also produces a program that crashes at
run time.  You can use the stock DJGPP version of <code>ld.exe</code> to see
the list of the missing functions, and then find out which libraries to
add to the link command line (use the <code>nm</code> utility to find out
which libraries contain the required external symbols).  The linker
supplied with RSXNTDJ is only required to link DLLs. 
</ul>

<p>If RSXNTDJ doesn't suit your needs, you can use a few other free
compilers which target Win32 platforms:

<dl>
<dt><code>Cygnus GNU-Win32 tools</code>
<dd>This tool-chain includes native Win32 ports of GCC and of many GNU
development tools.  It requires you to comply to the GNU License, the
GPL, when distributing programs built with these tools.  The tools and
the programs you build are native Win32 executables (won't run on DOS,
Windows 3.X or Win32s platforms) and Posix-compliant, but you need to
distribute a 4MB DLL file<a rel=footnote href="faq25.html"><sup>7</sup></a>, which implements the Posix layer, with all your
programs.  Also, GNU-Win32 is still in beta phase, and some bugs are
still worked on.  You can find GNU-Win32 on the <a href="http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/">Cygnus site</a>, or <a href="ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/gnu-win32/latest/">via FTP</a>.

<br><dt><code>Mingw32 (Minimal GNU-Win32)</code>
<dd>This features native Win32 port of GCC, but it relies on the Windows C
runtime (<code>CRTDLL.DLL</code>, which is standard on Windows 9X and
Windows/NT) and doesn't require any additional DLLs like Cygnus ports
do; however, you lose the Posix layer.  The basic package includes,
besides the compiler and Binutils, a few tools to compile resource files
and convert DLLs into <code>lib*.a</code> wrappers.  Since it doesn't use any
GPL'ed stuff except GCC and its subprograms, the programs produced by
Mingw32 are <em>free</em>.

<p>A disadvantage of this package is a relative lack of development tools
ported to Mingw32.  The compiler, Binutils, Make, GDB, Textutils and
Patch are available from the Mingw32 site, but ports of other utilities
tend to be scattered around and not integrated together into a coherent
package like what DJGPP or Cygwin present.  This causes compatibility
problems between the tools.  It is possible to use the DJGPP tools where
there are no equivalent Mingw32 ones, but you need to be aware of some
incompatibilities, such as different methods of passing long command
lines, lack of support for long file names on NT, etc.

<p>More details, including ready binaries of ported utilities and
source-level patches to build other utilities with Mingw32, are
available on <a href="http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32/">Mingw32 home page</a>.  For ports of
additional developemnt tools, visit <a href="http://agnes.dida.physik.uni-essen.de/~janjaap/mingw32/index.html">Jan-Jaap van der Heijden's site</a>. 
Mingw32 has a <a href="http://www.egroups.com/lists/mingw32/">mailing list</a>.

<br><dt><code>Lcc-Win32 compiler and tools</code>
<dd>This is a Win32 port of a freeware compiler Lcc, not related to GCC.  It
doesn't currently support C<tt>++</tt> programs.  The tool-chain includes
some additional utilities such as a very good IDE, a resource compiler
and a resource browser, a Make utility, and an icon maker.  The package
documentation is very good.  For more information, visit the <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/lcc/">Lcc home page</a> and the <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/">lcc-win32 home page</a>.

<br><dt><code>Dev-C++ package</code>
<dd>This is a freeware compiler and development environment for C and
C<tt>++</tt> programs which produces Win32 executables.  Besides the
compiler, the package includes a set of header files and libraries, a
port of GDB, an IDE with a multi-window editor that supports syntax
highlighting, and a project management tool.  The package is maintained
by <a href="mailto:webmaster@bloodshed.nu">Colin Laplace</a>, and is available
<a href="ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/win95/prog/devcpp30.zip">from SimTel.NET mirrors</a>. 
</dl>

<p>If you need on-line documentation of the Win32 API, you can find it as a
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/">Windows HLP file</a>.  Additional
links to tutorials and other related information can be found on the
<a href="http://people.montana.com/~bowman/Software/winAPI.htm">bowman's home page</a>.

<p>The recommended book for learning Win32 programming seems to be Charles
Petzold's <cite>Programming Windows: The Definitive Guide to the Win32
API</cite>, published by Microsoft Press.
