<h2>Looking Far Away Means Looking Back in Time</h2>
<p>

The cosmic microwave background (CMB) provides
us with a view of the early universe. We see
astronomical objects as they were in the past
because of the time it takes light to travel
across space. When we look at the Sun, we see
it as it was 8 minutes ago, because it takes
light 8 minutes to travel from the Sun to us.
It takes light 4 years to reach us from the
next nearest star, and 2 million years to reach
us from Andromeda, the nearest galaxy. Looking
far away in distance is like looking far back
in time. When we look at the CMB, we are looking
back billions of years, to a time before the first
stars and galaxies were formed, when the universe
was only a few hundred thousand years old.
<p>

<h2>What Can the CMB Tell Us About the Universe?</h2>
<p>

Measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
directly probe conditions of the early universe
and are a powerful tool for examining properties of the
universe, including:
<p>
<blockquote><font size=3>
<img width=10 align=top src="bl_ball.gif">
The geometry of the universe<br>
<img width=10 align=top src="bl_ball.gif">
Whether the universe will expand forever or collapse<br>
<img width=10 align=top src="bl_ball.gif">
The amount of matter in the universe<br>
<img width=10 align=top src="bl_ball.gif">
The amount and nature of dark matter and dark energy<br>
<img width=10 align=top src="bl_ball.gif">
The expansion rate of the universe<br>
<img width=10 align=top src="bl_ball.gif">
The age of the universe<br>
<img width=10 align=top src="bl_ball.gif">
The primordial seeds of galaxies and clusters<br>
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>
<h2>The Big Bang Model</h2>
<p>

The Big Bang model, which states that the universe was
once much smaller, hotter and denser in the past, is
based on Einstein's theory of general relativity and
stands on three key observational pillars:

<blockquote><font size=3>

<img width=10 align=top src="gr_ball.gif">
<b>Expansion of the universe.</b> Discovered in 1929, this implies
that the universe must have been have been smaller, and thus denser
and hotter in the past.<br>

<img width=10 align=top src="gr_ball.gif">
<b>The lightest elements.</b>
The observed amounts of light chemical elements, such as deuterium,
helium, and lithium, could not have formed in stars.  These elements
were created in the first few minutes, when the entire universe was
hot enough for nuclear fusion to occur.<br>

<img width=10 align=top src="gr_ball.gif">
<b>The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).</b>
The CMB, which is virtually uniform in all directions,
presents a spectrum that cannot be attributed to any
source other than a hot, uniform, dense early universe.

</font></blockquote><p>

<p>
<h2>Observing the CMB</h2>
<p>

The CMB, discovered in 1965 as excess noise in a microwave
receiver, has a nearly uniform temperature across the entire
sky: 2.73 degrees Kelvin above absolute zero. Superimposed
on this uniform background are tiny (about 10 parts per
million) variations in temperature. This departure from
uniformity, called anisotropy, was first observed by the
COBE satellite in 1991. The BOOMERANG map of the CMB is
over 40 times more detailed than the COBE map.
<p>

<p>
<h2>How the CMB formed</h2>
<p>

When the universe was very young, it was much hotter
and denser than the center of our Sun. It was an opaque
soup of sub-atomic particles and light (photons) colliding
with each other. As it expanded, the universe became
cooler and less dense.

<p>

There were small density variations in the soup from
one place to another, which would eventually grow
gravitationally to become the galaxies and clusters
of galaxies we see around us today. These density
variations were extremely weak, but strong enough
to affect the temperature of the photons. The more
dense regions correspond to hot spots in the CMB
and the less dense regions correspond to cold spots in the CMB.

<p>

When the universe was roughly 300,000 years old, it had
cooled enough that the sub-atomic particles could come
together to form atoms. This made the universe transparent;
the photons could travel through it without scattering or
being absorbed. These photons, which last interacted with
matter when the universe was 300,000 years old, form relic
radiation which is today called the CMB.

<p>

Gravitational collapse, starting when the universe was
about 1 billion years old, created large structures, such
as galaxies and clusters of galaxies, from the early
density variations. Thus the CMB is a link between
the hot, smooth early universe and the cool,
lumpy, 10 to 15 billion year old universe of today.


<p>
<h2>Shape of the Universe</h2>
<p>

angle is smaller in flat space<br>
<img width=100 src="kimshapes_flat.jpg">
<p>
angle is larger in curved space<br>
<img width=100 src="kimshapes_sph.jpg">

<p>

General relativity tells us that gravity is due to the
way mass and energy curve spacetime. If the universe
contains enough mass and energy to counteract its expansion,
it will eventually collapse. If not, it will expand forever.
By measuring the curvature of the universe, we can determine
the amount of mass and energy in the universe, and thus its fate.

<p>

If spacetime is curved, light travelling to us from the edges
of a distant object will follow the curve of spacetime, and
it will appear to be a different angular size.  In the diagram
above, the thick line in the spherically curved space is the
same size as the thick line in the flat space, but it spans
a wider angle. For the CMB, we can measure the angular size
of the hot and cold spots and thus determine the curvature
and fate of the universe.

<h2>BOOMERANG Overview</h2>
<p>


BOOMERANG flew around Antarctica, carried by a
stratospheric long-duration balloon (LDB). The
balloon takes the instrument above most of the
atmosphere, which can interfere with our
measurements. Our 1998 LDB flight was 10.5 days
long, more than 30 times longer than traditional
flights flown from North America. The instrument
measures the sky at four frequencies to help us
separate faint Galactic emissions from the CMB.

<p>

BOOMERANG's 10.5 day journey took it slowly around Antarctica
at an altitude of 120,000 feet, riding the stratospheric polar
vortex. We tracked its status via satellite link.  The payload
was dropped on a parachute to a spot about 30 miles from the
launch pad, for an easy recovery.

The cryogenic system containing the detectors is at the
center of the gondola, and the primary mirror is near the
bottom underneath a protective cover. The gondola hangs
from a balloon during flight, and scans back and forth
repeatedly over the selected observing field to map the CMB.
