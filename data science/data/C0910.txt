<B>Title:</B> CETA ADVISES TENANTS IN CHESHIRE TO GET PROTECTION </a> |   <B>Release Date:</B> 01/03/2002<hr color="#505050" align="left"><br>Tenants living in Cheshire need protection - so says the UK’s largest general insurance network, CETA, which is urging individuals living in rented accommodation to insure against the risk of being unable to meet their rent payments as a result of sickness, accident or unemployment. <br>
<br>
Managing Director of CETA, David Quick, explains: "The rapid growth of the buy to let, market combined with soaring house prices has made getting on the housing ladder more difficult for first time buyers.  As a result, a growing number of people are renting rather than purchasing a property”.<br>
<br>
"With redundancies hitting the headlines every week, tenants are vulnerable if they lose their jobs and incomes. The Government has been urging homeowners to make provision against such an eventuality by taking out payment protection insurance, but tenants seem to have been forgotten."<br>
<br>
To address this problem, CETA is launching a Safeguard Income Protection Policy that has been specifically designed to protect people living in rented accommodation. In the event of a tenant being involved in an accident, becoming ill, losing their job or being hospitalised, they will be able to continue to pay their rent and cover other essential living expenses.  <br>
<br>
The policy can be purchased via financial advisers throughout the UK or direct from CETA by phoning 0845 4583073.<br>
<br>
 The cost per £100 of cover for accident, sickness, unemployment and hospitalisation cover is £6.08 plus IPT.  To be eligible, tenants must be:<br>
<br>
·	Aged between 18 and 60<br>
<br>
·	In paid work for an average of 16 hours or more per week<br>
<br>
·	A permanent resident in the UK, Channel Islands or the Isle of Man<br>
<br>
·	Their employer must not currently be in merger / acquisition talks or within the last 12 months have announced a reduction in staff numbers<br>
<br>
·	Be aware of any impending unemployment or medical treatment  or advice<br>
<br>
The policy provides cover for a period of 12 months, following an exclusion period of 60 days and policyholders will be eligible to receive payments of up to 50% of their gross salary, subject to a maximum payment of £1500 per month.<br>
