    reservations over the imminent deal of BSkyB to buy Manchester United in their report to
    the Office of Fair Trading who are investigating the £625m takeover.</font></p>
    <font size="2"><p>Wiseman said: &quot;The FA have written to the OFT saying that if the
    bid is allowed to go through it will create a situation where not only the strength of one
    club but also the influence of one club would extend far beyond the range of others.</p>
    <p>&quot;Our opinion has been reached on our football feelings. You can't put a finger on
    the mischief but most people have a gut feeling that the bid is not right. It will produce
    some distortions.</p>
    <p>&quot;The overall message we have conveyed is that this is not something to be
    welcomed,&quot; Wiseman told the Daily Telegraph.</p>
    <p>Edwards said he was unable to comment due to the ongoing situation.</p>
    <p>&quot;Someone is trying to take us over and I have to be very careful about what I say
    because we have stock market regulations to think of,&quot; Edwards said.</font><font

    </font><p><font size="2">The Office of Fair Trading will decide on November 2 whether to
    refer the takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.</font></p>
