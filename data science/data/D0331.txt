<p>NASA's Stardust spacecraft, launched in February 1999 on a
mission to collect a sample from Comet Wild-2, remains in good
health as it travels the solar system. However, close navigation to the comet may change
somewhat depending on the results of further testing.

<p>On Monday, Sept. 4, the final images were received from an
onboard test to determine if mild heating alone might clear the
camera's view. Images showing the contamination confirm that the
camera is "fogged."

<p>The week-long heater test increased the temperature around
the window from -35C (-31F) to about 8C (47F). The blurring
shown in the recent images changed from image to image as the
heating progressed.

<p>Engineers hope to better characterize the nature of the
blurring by analyzing navigation camera images of several
starfields. It is also possible that there may be contamination on
the periscope and/or the scan mirror, which are external to the
lens.

<p>Project engineers say that since the camera was the coldest
part of the spacecraft shortly after launch, it would tend to act
almost like flypaper in picking up any volatile materials coming
from the spacecraft immediately after launch. Investigations into
the origin of the coating are inconclusive.

<p>The camera's main duty is to guide the spacecraft to the
exact point of closest approach to the comet, and it is also
scheduled to take pictures of the comet.
However, close navigation to the comet may change somewhat
depending on the results of further testing.<br>

<p>Quick-thinking NASA engineers and scientists helped the 
Stardust spacecraft survive a close encounter with a storm of 
high-energy particles from the Sun after a recent solar flare.  
 
<p>Stardust, a NASA mission to return samples of a comet, 
was only 1.4 AU (130 million miles) from the Sun on the 
afternoon of Wed., Nov. 9.  It was flying at about 20,000 
kilometers per hour (over 12,000 miles per hour). 

<p>Engineers from the Stardust team were a little worried, 
since they had heard that the fourth largest solar flare since 
1976 was heading toward Earth.  This monster cloud of 
energized particles was 100,000 times more intense than usual, 
and it was heading toward Stardust. 

<p>The engineers' fears came to pass in the middle of the 
night, when the solar wind's stream of high-energy protons hit 
the spacecraft. Its two star cameras, which it uses to control 
the spacecraft's orientation, got a large dose of energy.  
Protons from the solar wind electrified pixels in the star 
cameras, producing dots that the camera interpreted as stars. 
  

<p>The spacecraft did the safest thing it could – it went 
into standby mode, turning its solar panels toward the Sun and 
waiting for communication from Earth.  While it was waiting, 
the spacecraft tried again to determine its attitude by using 
two different sets of cameras.

<p>The flight team didn't hear from Stardust when they tried 
to communicate with it the next morning. They deduced that the 
solar flare had caused it to go into standby mode, and they 
knew that meant the spacecraft would send a signal within 24 
hours.

<p>Scientists confirmed their theory when they reviewed data 
from the spacecraft that verified that the problems had begun 
when the solar flare occurred.

<p>On Saturday, November 11th, the flight team reset the 
first star camera and turned it back on. They used another 
method of orienting the spacecraft, called inertial measuring 
units, while they inspected the cameras.
 
<p>On Monday, the Stardust flight team commanded the 
spacecraft to leave its safe mode. The star camera was back on 
the job, controlling the orientation of the spacecraft 
perfectly.

<p>An image taken days after the solar flare subsided shows 
that the camera had completely recovered from the proton hits. 
All the bright objects in the picture can be identified as 
stars, Jupiter or Saturn.

<h1>Current Updates:</h1>
<p>After a few months of foggy camera vision, NASA's
Stardust mission team has improved the spacecraft's
navigation-camera resolution to nearly normal, just as
Stardust is preparing to make a close flyby of the Earth on
Monday.

<p>By heating the camera's optical path, the Stardust
team was able to help its nearsighted spacecraft boil away
contaminants that had been deposited on optical surfaces.

<p>One year ago, the imaging team took pictures of a
small lamp inside the optical path of the camera. The
camera will be used to navigate Stardust to its 2004
encounter with Comet Wild 2 (pronounced "vilt-2"). Apparent
contamination of the navigation-camera prevented a clear
test-image of the squiggly line of the lamp's filament, and
the lens seemed to be covered with a veil of light-
scattering material that produced a blurry image.

<p>The team concluded that the contamination might have
been released with gases escaping from the spacecraft after
its launch, and that heating the optical path of the camera
might evaporate the contaminant covering the camera lens.
After a series of heating cycles, they re-tested the camera
by taking more pictures of the lamp.

<p>Pictures taken after the heating revealed that the
zigzag line of the lamp's filament was visible again.
Images of stars taken by the camera are also clearer. The
team estimates the camera can now photograph stars two
magnitudes (celestial degrees of brightness) better. The
navigation camera has detected stars as faint as 9th
magnitude in brightness, which should allow the spacecraft
to perform its final navigation maneuvers during approach
to the comet nearly at the time originally planned.

<p>Now Stardust, on its journey to collect comet dust, is
getting ready to springboard from Earth -- in a maneuver
called a "gravity-assist" -- when the spacecraft passes
closest to Earth on January 15, 2001.   The Earth will not
be in the navigation camera's field-of-view during the
flyby, so no images of Earth will be taken.

<p>Stardust was launched on February 7, 1999, into its
first loop around the Sun. When Stardust passes by Earth at
about 10 kilometers per second (22,400 miles per hour), it
will go into a slightly wider orbit that will allow it to
reach the comet on January 2, 2004.

<p>On Monday, January 15, Stardust will fly by a point
just southeast of the southern tip of Africa, slightly more
than 6,000 kilometers (3,700 miles) from the surface at
about 3:15 a.m. PST  (5:15 a.m. EST).

<p>Stardust may be visible to observers using
sophisticated telescopes with charge-coupled device (CCD)
detectors from the Pacific Ocean and the Western United
States just after the spacecraft flies by Earth. Stardust
will not be visible using binoculars.

<p>A gravity-assist works like this: when a spacecraft
closely approaches a planet, the planet's gravitational
pull accelerates the spacecraft and bends the flight path.
Mission designers account for this extra pull and use it to
their advantage to boost spacecraft speed and direct
interplanetary spacecraft to their targets. Like a windup
before the pitch, the Earth gravity-assist will sling
Stardust into the right path to meet Comet Wild 2.

<p>About 15 hours after its closest approach to Earth,
the spacecraft will pass about 98,000 kilometers (61,000
miles) from the Moon. Because of the greater distance, the
Moon's gravity will have essentially no influence on the
spacecraft's flight path.
