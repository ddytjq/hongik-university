          <br>
          <b>Features</b><br>
          <br>
          Pays your mortgage for 12 months if you are absent from work as a result 
          of redundancy or illness (see Cover).<br>
          <br>
          On joint mortgages, the monthly benefit can be apportioned. This means 
          that you can select cover in relation to the proportion of salary each 
          of you earn e.g. 60/40, 50/50, 70/30.<br>
          <br>
          The benefit level or apportionment of monthly benefit can be changed 
          on request, ensuring consistent cover.<br>
          <br>
          Support from the Society in the event of having to make a claim.<br>
          <br>
          If you take out the policy with Newbury Building Society the first three 
          months' premiums are FREE!<br>
          <br>
          <b>Cover</b><br>
          <br>
          After 60 days away from work due to an accident, or illness or because 
          you were made unemployed through no fault of your own, the insurers 
          will pay Newbury Building Society an amount equal to 1/30th of the monthly 
          benefit you select, for each following day of your absence thereafter, 
          up to a maximum of 12 monthly benefits.<br>
          <br>
          To be eligible for our Mortgage Payment Protection Insurance, at the 
          start date of cover you must be:<br>
          <br>
           Aged between 18 and 64 years; and<br>
           Resident within the United Kingdom, Channel Islands or Isle of Man; 
          and<br>
           Working for at least 16 hours per week within the United Kingdom, 
          Channel Islands or Isle of Man and have been continuously for the previous 
          6 months; and<br>
           Not already absent from work because of illness or injury; and<br>
           Not aware of any impending unemployment.<br>
          <br>
          There are some exclusions to cover but we have tried to keep them to 
          a minimum. These are claims resulting from:<br>
          <br>
           War, riot or radiation;<br>
           Alcohol or drug abuse;<br>
           Normal pregnancy;<br>
           Self-inflicted injuries;<br>
           Pre-existing medical conditions;<br>
           Mental or nervous disorders (unless under the care of a specialist);<br>
           Seasonal unemployment, misconduct or voluntary employment;<br>
           Any period where you are receiving payment in lieu of notice;<br>
           Backache (unless x-ray evidence of abnormality);<br>
           Impending unemployment at the policy start date; and<br>
           Unemployment occurring within the first 60 days of cover.<br>
          <br>
          <b>When Cover and Benefit Ends</b><br>
          <br>
          Your insurance cover and any benefit being paid will end automatically 
          upon the earliest of these events:<br>
          <br>
           Your 65th birthday.<br>
           When you retire from work completely.<br>
           Non-payment of the monthly premium.<br>
           The date you no longer have a mortgage to protect.<br>
          <br>
          </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Unemployment 
          Cover</b><br>
          <br>
          The cover you receive will depend on the type of employment contract 
          you have at the time of claim.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Permanent employees</b> - If you have a permanent, open-ended contract, 
          you are covered for compulsory redundancy.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Fixed term contract workers</b> - If you have a renewable fixed term 
          contract, you are covered if:<br>
          <br>
           Your employer cancels the contract early or if they do not renew it 
          again, provided it was an annual contract and had already been renewed 
          at least once; or<br>
           You had worked for the same employer for at least 24 months; or you 
          previously worked for the same employer under a permanent contract.<br>
          <br>
          If your contract and work record are any other than described above, 
          you are covered only if your employer cancels your contract early (not 
          if they do not renew it). Please note that benefit will not be paid 
          after the date the contract would have normally expired.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Self-employed workers</b> - You are covered if you cease trading 
          due to insolvency and have declared this to the Inland Revenue.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Additional Options</b><br>
          <br>
          You have the option to increase your monthly benefit to allow for other 
          outgoings related to your mortgage e.g. buildings and contents insurance, 
          life assurance or even your mortgage payment protection insurance premium. 
          Please note that increasing your monthly benefit may affect your entitlement 
          to certain State benefits.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Pricing</b><br>
          <br>
          We have negotiated a special rate for you. The monthly premium is 4.22 
          for each 100 of monthly benefit required. Insurance Premium Tax (set 
          by the Government) needs to be added. For example, if your mortgage 
          payment is 450 per month, then your monthly Mortgage Payment Protection 
          Insurance premium is 4.5 x 4.22 = 18.99 - a small price to pay for 
          peace of mind. In addition, the first three months' premiums are free 
          of charge!<br>
          <br>
          <b>Important Information</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>The Insurer</b><br>
          <br>
          The policy is administered and underwritten by a Consortium of Insurers 
          comprising certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London, Scor UK Company 
          and Zurich Insurance Company.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Terms & Conditions</b><br>
          <br>
          This website page is intended to give you the main features of our Mortgage 
          Payment Protection Insurance policy. Full terms and conditions are explained 
          in the Evidence of Cover document, which is available on request and 
          will be given to you on acceptance of your application by the insurer. 
          Unless otherwise specifically agreed, this insurance shall be governed 
          by and construed in accordance with the Law of England.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Fraudulent Claims</b><br>
          <br>
          To prevent fraudulent claims, insurers share information with each other. 
          In the event of a claim, the details you give on your insurance application 
          may be shared, along with any information relating to the claim.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Scheme Amendments or Cancellation</b><br>
          <br>
          Should it be necessary for the Insurers to amend or cancel this Insurance 
          scheme you will be given at least 30 days prior written notification, 
          sent to your last known address. In the event of cancellation your cover 
          will cease automatically on the date that the Scheme is cancelled and 
          no further premium will be due from you. However, you will continue 
          to receive benefits due in respect of a period of disability or unemployment 
          if your loss date was prior to the date the scheme was cancelled.<br>
          <b><br>
          Direct Debit Guarantee</b><br>
          <br>
          This guarantee is offered by all banks and building societies that take 
          part in the direct debit scheme. The efficiency and security of the 
          scheme is monitored and protected by your own bank or building society. 
          The amounts are variable and may be debited on various dates. If the 
          premium to be paid changes, other than due to a change in the Insurance 
          Premium Tax (see below), you will be told of this in advance by at least 
          14 days.<br>
          <br>
          No further notice will be given in respect of any change in the amount 
          to be deducted arising solely from an alteration in the rate of Insurance 
          Premium Tax. Any alteration in the rate of Insurance Premium Tax will 
          be announced publicly.<br>
          <br>
          If an error is made by Cassidy Davis Insurance Services Ltd or your 
          bank or building society, you are guaranteed a full and immediate refund 
          from your branch of the amount paid. You can cancel a direct debit at 
          any time by writing to your bank or building society. Please also send 
          a copy of your letter to the Scheme Administrators.<br>
          <br>
          <b>If you have a problem</b><br>
          <br>
          It is always the intention to provide you with a first class service. 
          However, if you have cause for complaint the procedure described here 
          should be followed and the Scheme Administrators will be pleased to 
          give you any additional information or advice that you may need. Procedure:<br>
          <br>
          1. in the first instance you should address your complaint to the Managing 
          Director of the Scheme Administrators.<br>
          2. Should you not be satisfied with the response you may then ask the 
          Complaints and Advisory Department at Lloyd's of London to review your 
          case.<br>
          3. If you still remain dissatisfied you may then contact the Insurance 
          Ombudsman. The Scheme Administrators will provide the full addresses 
          of these organisations and the referral of your complaint to them will 
          not affect your rights in law.<br>
          <br>
          <b>General Insurance Standards Council (GISC) Code</b><br>
          <br>
          Newbury Building Society is an independent intermediary member of the 
          General Insurance Standards Council (GISC), selling Mortgage Payment 
          Protection Insurance on behalf of the insurers.<br>
          <br>
          The GISC is an independent organisation set up to regulate the sales, 
          advisory and service standards of members (insurers), intermediaries 
          (including brokers), agents and anyone acting for them. Its main purpose 
          is to make sure that general insurance customers are treated fairly.<br>
          <br>
          The GISC Code sets out minimum standards of good practice, which all 
          GISC members must follow when they deal with private customers. We are 
          committed to providing you with standards exceeding those laid out in 
          the GISC Code and welcome you to tell us if we are not meeting your 
          expectations.<br>
          <br>
          A copy of the GISC Code is available on request. It can also be obtained 
          from the GISC website - <a href="http://www.gisc.co.uk/" target="_blank"><b>www.gisc.co.uk</b></a>.<br>
          <b><br>
          Data Protection</b><br>
          <br>
          The Insurers will collect certain information about you in the course 
          of considering your application and, if they issue a certificate of 
          insurance, in conducting their relationship with you. This information 
          will be processed for the purpose of underwriting your insurance cover, 
          managing any insurance issued, administering claims and fraud prevention. 
          They may pass your information to a qualified medical practioner, other 
          insurers, reinsurers and loss adjusters for these purposes. This may 
          involve the transfer of your information to countries which do not have 
          data protection laws.<br>
          <br>
          You may have a right of access to, and correction of, information that 
          is held about you. Please contact the Insurer's Compliance Officer to 
          exercise either of these rights.<br>
          <br>
          Some of the information may be classified as 'sensitive' - that is information 
          about physical and mental health and employment records. Data protection 
          laws impose specific conditions in relation to sensitive information, 
          including in some circumstances the need to obtain your explicit consent 
          before the insurers process the information. By signing your application, 
          you consent to the processing and transfer of information described 
          in this notice. Without this consent the Insurers would not be able 
          to consider your application. <br>
