1978 Mercury Cougar
<BR>
351M Motor - Paid $100.00
<br>
Motor ran fine when warm, but not cold.  Found choke not working.
<br>
The rear bumper was soo rusty that I took it off with a few swings of the sledgehammer.
<p>
Decided to try and run the car in the figure 8 derby and save something for the demo derby later in the week.
<br>
Won my heat easily with very little damage.  Led from lap 5 to the finish on lap 10.
<br>
In the feature, I tried to drive smart and avoid totaing my car out.  
<br>
Ended up finishing 3rd out of the 104 cars total (about 20 in the feature). Not too bad for a Mercury.
<br>
Front bumper shocks are pretty mangled, but the car's still in good condition for the derby.
