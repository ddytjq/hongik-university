<h2>Essay #8: Hints for the Antipode - Absorbers</h2>

<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>
When astronomers refer to "absorbers", just exactly what are they talking
about?</p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left><a href="http://www.xware.ru/db/msg/apod/2000-11-12">This picture</a>
 gives you a good idea of what the absorbers are. 
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Astronomers do not observe such structure directly.   Its size and
shape is inferred from the absorption of light in front of (or "blue shifted"
relative to) the farther quasars.   If we looked across such space, these
clouds would show up as an absorption lines - sometimes thick, sometimes
thin - in front of a quasar.
</p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The spectrum of virtually every luminous deep object shows a series of
dark absorption lines of a variety of thickness caused when specific elements
absorb photons at a certain wavelength. &nbsp; By far the most common absorber
is the one caused by ionized hydrogen gas, whose "at rest" absorption line
occurs at 1216 &Aring; (Angstroms, 10<sup>-8</sup> cm). &nbsp; However, these
clouds are receding ("red shifted") along with everything else, and the stationary
wavelength is observed at longer wavelengths.
</p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>And it's a good thing that they become longer, because the earth's atmosphere is opaque to light transmission just below 3000 &Aring;.   This
means the absorber has to have a red shift of about 1.6 or higher before
it becomes visible with ground based telescopes.    Of course, the quasar
which "illuminates" it has to be even further. </p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="red">[What's interesting about the red shift of
z = 1.6 is that it is at or very close to the red shift at which objects
are passing through a <em>minimum</em> in size if we use the most reasonable
cosmological assumptions <font color="navy"> (h<sub>0</sub> = 70, <font face="symbol">
W</font><sub>m</sub> = 0.3, and <font face="symbol">W</font><sub>vac</sub>
 = 0.7)</font>, as was discussed <a href="perceptions(2).html#minimum">in
Essay #2</a>] </font> </blockquote>
 <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>When the absorbers become visible with terrestrial telescopes they
exhibit a dramatic exponential increase at higher red shifts.   The most reasons for this type of distribution are twofold: (1)
it takes millions (billions?) of years for the clouds to coalesce from the
"primordial soup" into the accretion disks that eventually become galaxies,
and (2) the early universe is smaller at higher red shifts (for the simple
reason that we're looking back in time) and this fact alone makes the clouds
appear larger from our perspective, and more likely to be noticed as we look
farther out into space. </p>
  <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>If we know the red shift z for a certain object, the size of the universe
is 1/(1 + z) in the era in which we are observing that object. &nbsp; So
a distant object with a red shift of two resides in a universe only one third
as large as it is in the local vicinity.&nbsp; </p>
  <p> <a name="large">  </a> 
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>But there are a few surprises in the clouds... 
  </p>
  <p> 
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The first one is that some of the clouds at very high red shifts seem
to appear in front of two quasars separated by a few tenths of an arc
degree. &nbsp; (The sun and moon are one half of an arc degree or 30 arc
minutes.) &nbsp; That is, an absorption line at virtually the same wavelength
appears in the spectra of both quasars. &nbsp; If the lines are caused by
the same cloud, the cloud is very large, although we don't know <em>how</em>
 large because we have no way of knowing where the edge is. </p>
  <p> 
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>A galaxy like our own seen at high red shift has a diameter
of just a few arc seconds (60 arc seconds = one arc minute).&nbsp; The fact
that some clouds at high red shifts are so much larger than galaxies - they're
getting up in the 30' to 60' <em>minimum</em> size so far - is disconcerting
to many astronomers because the evolutionary sizes are supposed to be much
smaller, especially since we're looking into a smaller and earlier universe. 
  </p>
  <p>
  <blockquote> <font color="red"> [Well<strong>...</strong>It depends<strong>...</strong>If the basic structure is a long stringy filament, then a size
of 30' to 60' is probably OK.   But the problem is that the absorbers are
rather more clustered (closer together) than the above picture leads you
to believe, and many astronomers believe that they are "flattened pancakes",
probably galaxies in the process of coalescing.   If the "pancake" idea is
correct, then the apparent very large size is a problem.] </font> </blockquote>
  
    <p> 
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The Hubble Space Telescope (HST), not encumbered by the opaque limit
just below 3000 &Aring;, came up with a second surprise.   Based on the frequency
increase at the high red shifts, astronomers developed empirical formulas
describing the increase.   If those formulas were accurate at the lower red
shifts not visible with ground based telescopes, they indicated the clouds
should be virtually nonexistent at lower red shifts in the more recent universe.
  </p>
    <p> 
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>"Not so!" said the HST.   In fact the clouds <em>are</em> quite
common at wavelengths previously invisible with ground based telescopes,
though at a much lower frequency than at the higher wavelengths. &nbsp; Little
or no change in the frequency was observed at the lower red shifts, in stark
disagreement to the prediction of exponential decay if the empirical formulas
derived from higher red shift absorbers were even <em>remotely</em> accurate. </p>
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Despite these surprises, most researchers still believe there is a plausible evolutionary explanation for the the behavior
of these clouds in flat, or <em>nearly</em> flat, Friedmann space. </p>
    <p> 
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>There is also a reasonable explanation in Riemannian space, with
its inferred antipode. </p>
    <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>All we have to do is modify slightly the first thought experiment
we did in <a href="perceptions(2).html#clouds">Essay #2</a>.   Suppose we're
at the north pole of a spherical surface with light confined to the surface.
  For the sake of simplicity we'll ignore evolution by assuming many small
clouds are just about the same size and evenly distributed over the southern
hemisphere. </p>
    <p> 
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>But even though the clouds <em>are</em> the same size, they won't
    <em>look</em> the same size from our perspective at the north pole. 
 Instead the clouds nearer the south pole will <em>appear</em> larger due
to the curvature of the surface.   If we thought there <em>was</em> a south
pole, we could estimate its position by noting the distance at which the
clouds are most likely to be in our line of sight<strong>;</strong> it would
correspond to the peak in frequency. </p>
    <p>
<blockquote>
<font color=red>
[You might want to check out the <A HREF="App6.html#table">table</A> in Appendix 6.  There's a note at the bottom of the table indicating that the middle column on luminosity could also be used to predict the apparent relative size of a cloud at that position on the surface.   Thus the chances of a given cloud appearing in our line of sight depends on <em>where it is</em>.   If it's close to the "south pole" (or antipode of a hypersphere), the chances are much higher that we'll notice it there than if this cloud is near the "equator".]
</font>
</blockquote>
<p> 
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>If there is an antipode within our Hubble horizon - and it 
looks like there <em>might</em> be one at or near z = 3.5 - we could make
the following three very simple predictions about the behavior of the clouds
in its vicinity: </p>
    <p> <font color="navy"> </font></p>
    <ol type="A">
 
      <li><font color="navy">The number of clouds we observe as absorption
lines should <em>increase</em> as we look toward the antipode, then <em>decrease</em> 
in number as we look beyond it. </font>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><font color="navy">The size of the clouds could become very large
in the vicinity of the antipode. </font>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><font color="navy">If the clouds appear very large, at the same
time they should appear less dense.   (What this means in layman's terms
is that an ordinarily "thick" cloud will appear as a "thin" cloud because
its matter would be stretched by the unexpected positive curvature
of space near the antipode.) </font> </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>A. The Prediction of Higher, Then Lower, Number Counts in the Absorbers</h4>
 </font> </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p> <IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The number of clouds is usually expressed as an empirical formula
in this form: </p>
      <p> </p>
      <center><strong>N<sub>z</sub> = N<sub>0</sub>(1 + z)<sup><font face="symbol">
g</font></sup></strong></center>
 
      <p> where N<sub>0</sub> is an arbitrary base, N<sub>z</sub> is the
number at red shift z, and <font face="symbol">g</font> is whatever exponent
is the best "fit" for the data. </p>
      <p> <IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Here is <a href="http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept01/Rauch/Rauch_contents.html">
a good site</a> by Michael Rauch at Cal Tech discussing the absorbers. &nbsp;
Scroll down to the table of contents and then take the link to "The Redshift
Evolution of the Lyman Alpha Forest". &nbsp; The discussion indicates there
is a wide opinion about the values of the generic formula above and does
not provide the <em>slightest</em> hint that anything particularly unusual
is going on out in the mid three range of red shifts, which is what we would
expect if there's an antipode. </p>
      <p> <IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>In fact, Dr. Rauch indicates that the absorbers are <em>increasing</em>
 at the higher red shifts   beyond z = 3, which is contrary to what we would
expect if the curvature of space caused by the antipode were the dominant
factor here. </p>

This abstract</a>, with Gerry Williger as the primary author, gives just
about everything we want, and then some. &nbsp; This team of researchers
measured absorbers in from of quasars some 30' apart (the size of the full
moon and the sun) and found good evidence for common absorption across the
whole range of red shifts from z = 2.15 to 3.37. &nbsp; And the chances of
a common absorber increased significantly at higher red shifts and thinner
clouds. </p>
        <p> <IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>It's an old adage that "for example" is no proof, but this example
will, I believe, become commonplace as the absorbers are checked against
an increasing number of high red shift quasars.   </p>

        <blockquote> 
          <p> <IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left><a href="http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/IoA/preprint/1999-10.html">
This page</a> shows several papers for which you can get a printout.   You
want to take the link to the third paper listed from Gerry Williger et al.
- the same Gerry Williger mentioned above.   This is the actual paper for
the above abstract. </p>
          <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> There are several ways to get a printout, but I select "other",
then use the "pdf" format (third on the list). &nbsp; It may take a minute
or two to get the 33 page paper. &nbsp; After you get it, you might want
to take a look at the abstract on the first page (I used the Harvard Abstract
version before). &nbsp; Then go to page 14 (or figure 5 if you're in another
format). &nbsp; Here you'll see how the number counts of clouds of various
widths (measured in &Aring;) are changing rather dramatically at the
higher red shifts under scrutiny. </p>
          <p> <IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>It's a fair question<strong>:</strong> why is the cloud density
decreasing just before the mid three range of red shifts.   There is a noticeable
drop in all six plots between z = 3 and z = 3.2, and you do wonder what would
have happened is the data had gone just a little higher. </p>
          <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Which leads to an interesting question<strong>...</strong>If the cloud density
is <em>decreasing</em>, what is happening to the overall population if the
number counts are <em>increasing</em>.   Apparently, a number of higher density
clouds are being replaced by even more numerous lower density clouds. </p>
          <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> But if this deduction is correct, how long does it continue? 
          <blockquote>
          <font color=red>
          <p>[It has always seemed logical to me that the <em>number counts</em>
 of the absorbers would flag the antipode, rather like the number counts of quasars.   The <em>highest</em> number counts of the absorbers at a certain red shift ought to match the <em>lowest</em> number counts of quasars at that same red shift. 
<p>
This does not seem to be the case. </p>
          <p> However, Figure 5 on page 14 in Williger's paper above sure leads
one to suspect that the antipode just might be flagged rather well by another
parameter in the same population<strong>:</strong> it's the position at which
clouds pass through a <em>minimum</em> in cloud density (i.e., where the &Aring; width
of the absorbers is <em>smallest</em>).
<p>
Williger's paper seems to suggest
this minimum might be pretty dramatic.   </p>
<p>          
And it probably won't surprise you that I've
looked for confirmation of this predicted increase/decrease in the number counts of absorbers in the Harvard Abstract Service for a few
years and have yet to find anything as convincing as the behavior of quasars.
<p>
The best I could come up with is <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2000ApJ...543..552S&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high=3bf93a82e114999">
this abstract</a>.   It's a discussion of how neutral gas is behaving in
deep space at high red shifts, and the most interesting description is in
the second section.   At least neutral gas is not so susceptible to evolutionary
effects as the standard 1216&Aring; line seems to be.   This really isn't
what I want, but it will have to do until I find something better.   And
it's one more significant change in trend line out there in the mid three
range of red shifts.]

 </p>
            <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Of course, at nearly 87% of the total distance toward
the singularity, we're in a very early universe, in a highly evolutionary
environment.   Most detailed studies of the absorbers are confined
to the mid three red shifts or less - that should change real soon - and
so I haven't come across any references in the absorbers that indicate anything
as dramatic as the odd quasar behavior shown <a href="QSOTable7.html">in
Table 7</a>. </p>
            <p> <IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Come to think of it, there never have been that many dramatic
references to <em>this</em> either. <pre>
