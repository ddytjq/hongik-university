      <p>Hockey has been referred to as a game played with clubs (hockey
sticks), knives (skates), and bullets (pucks). Indeed, sticks are often used
as &#8216;weapons and during shooting can reach angular velocities of up to 40
radians/second. Skate blades have the potential to sever nerves, tendons
and blood vessels in unprotected areas. Pucks can have impact forces exceeding
5,500 newtons and, given the small surface area of impact, the injury potential
is high. Yet despite the increased potential for injury related to these
&#8216;tools of hockey, by far the most common serious injury circumstance in minor 
hockey (10-17 years of age, males) is player contact (both intentional and
unintentional).&nbsp; </p>

Hockey Injuries, Physicians Urge</a>
      </b></h2>
 Wednesday, February 2, 2000 
      <p>Minneapolis - The Minnesota Medical Association, representing about 
9,500 physicians throughout the state, warns of the injuries associated with
body checking in ice hockey and urges coaches, parents, fans and players to
take steps to reduce risk. </p>
      <p>One Minnesota study found that body checking accounted for 59 percent 
of hockey injuries (20 percent from legal checking and 39 percent from illegal
checking) and that rules violations were responsible for another 27 percent. 
      </p>
      <p>Most injuries are contusions, sprains, strains, and fractures. But
occasionally, injuries can be severe. A direct blow to the top of the head
of a player in the chin-down position can result in a paralyzing cervical
spine injury. In a study of 117 hockey players with spine or spinal cord
injuries, the most common cause was a punch or check from behind that sent
the player headfirst into the boards. </p>
      <p>"Hockey is an exciting, fast paced game," said John Van Etta, M.D., 
president of the Minnesota Medical Association. "But it&#8217;s important to learn
how to reduce the risk of catastrophic injury. Just one tragedy is one too
many." </p>

Sudden death of a young hockey player: case report of commotio cordis</a>

      <p><b>Deady B, Innes G</b> </p>
      <p>Royal Columbian Hospital New Westminster, BC, Canada. </p>
      <p>Despite the use of protective gear, a 15-year-old hockey player
died when he was struck in the chest by a puck. This is the fifth recorded
hockey death related to so-called commotio cordis, that is, blunt chest injury 
without myocardial structural damage. In light of inadequacies of commercial 
chest protectors currently in use for hockey, the authors hope to educate 
players and coaches about the danger of blocking shots with the chest.&nbsp; 
      </p>
      <p>Physicians should be aware that commotio cordis represents a distinctive 
pathological condition, in the event of which immediate recognition, precordial 
thump, CPR, and defibrillation are potentially lifesaving. Appropriate medical
supervision at amateur hockey games, 911 telephone access, and on-site automated
external defibrillators are issues that deserve careful consideration.&nbsp;

      <p>STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the implementation of published injury
prevention strategies in injured youth ice hockey players, to examine factors
contributing to current youth ice hockey injuries, and to assess attitudes
of participants toward injury-risk activities. </p>
      <p>CONCLUSION: While compliance with protective equipment requirements 
was good, rule enforcement was perceived to be inadequate. Elimination of
checking would potentially reduce the number of significant injuries more
than would the enforcement of existing rules. Injured youth hockey players
are underinformed about the hazards of their sport and are too willing to
engage in potentially injurious activities.&nbsp; </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Risk factors</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ice hockey offers ample opportunity 
for injuries: Players wear skate blades, use sticks, and shoot pucks. They 
travel at high speeds, on a slippery surface, in a space that is confined 
by boards. Moreover, some players play hockey as a collision sport.&nbsp;</font>
 </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#Checking">Body Checking</a>
      </font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Clearly, body checking (collision) 
increases the likelihood of injury. In a study of high school players, <b>
body checking accounted for 38% of all injuries, with illegal play being
responsible for another 26%</b>. Collision accounted for 50% of all injuries
in another study of youth hockey. In still another study, body checking accounted 
for 59% of all injuries (20% resulting from legal checking and 39% from illegal
checking), with rule violations being responsible for another 27%. When fracture
rates were compared in body-checking versus non-body-checking leagues among
49 Canadian Peewee teams, researchers found that fracture was 12 times more
common in the body-checking leagues.&nbsp;</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Body checking contributes not
only to the number of injuries sustained but also to their severity. In a
study of 117 hockey players with spine or spinal cord injuries, the most
common cause of such injury was a push or check from behind (by an opponent)
that catapulted the player headfirst into the boards.&nbsp;</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Nevertheless, collision is allowed 
in boys' ice hockey at the Peewee level, even though size and physical maturity
differ considerably among boys under 16 years of age. Weight can range from
34 to 70 kg (75 to 155 lbs) for Peewees and from 37 to 90 kg (80 to 200 lbs)
for Bantams. According to one study, larger Peewee players exerted an impact
force 70% greater than that exerted by their smaller teammates.&nbsp;</font>
 </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#Violence">Lax Rule
Enforcement</a>
      </font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rule enforcement is especially
important in a game that can result in serious injury or death. One youth
hockey study, however, showed that for 29 injuries resulting from tactics
judged illegal, only four penalties were assessed. Also, researchers studying 
catastrophic injury noted that rules were frequently not enforced and players 
were injured as a result of illegal play.&nbsp;</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#Violence">Violence</a>
      </font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Violence in hockey is a problem
at all levels of play, including the youth level, and body checking contributes 
to it. Investigators in one study described the environment of one in three 
youth hockey games in which an injury occurred as hostile: Players called 
one another names and fought; parents became angry; and referee calls were 
hotly disputed. Fifteen percent of all injuries were deemed intentional. The
same authors found that 26% of Peewee and Bantam players who understood that
checking from behind could cause serious injury or death reported that they
would be willing to do so if "angry" or to "get even." According to another
group of researchers, the risk of concussion was four times higher among
players who identified "Playing hockey helped me to get rid of tensions and
aggressions" as their first or second reason for playing than among those
who identified other reasons.</font> </p>

Hockey Helmet Safety</a>
      </h2>
 <tt>Head injuries in hockey are an ever-growing problem in the sport and 
experts say helmets are a big part of the reason. Most hockey players?amateur 
and professional, young and old?are wearing substandard hockey helmets because,
while the game has dramatically changed in the last 10 years, the standard
for helmets hasn't kept up.</tt>

      <p>What sport involves a piece of equipment that can move at speeds
of 160 km/hour, but weighs only 170 grams? Players of this sport can move 
at 40 km/hour and weigh about 100 kilograms. Hint: it is a winter sport. The
answer...ice hockey. Ice hockey combines the grace of skating with the aggressiveness
of football. The nature of this fast-paced, sometimes violent game also carries
the risk of head and brain injury.&nbsp; </p>

is now routinely assessing for concussion and providing <b><u>baseline neuropsychological 
screening </u></b>for their players. Now, there is a national trend to provide
baselines for our high school and young athletes who are also at risk for
concussion. Baselines that are performed prior to injury provide valuable
information to help later determine when the player is ready to return to
play, as well as if he/she is in need of treatment. Baseline screening includes
noninvasive tests that measure attention, memory and other cognitive skills.
However, it is not intelligence or achievement testing. Neuropsychological
testing is often more sensitive to the effects of mild head injury than MRI,
CT, or neurological exam.&nbsp;</font></font></font></p>

Ice Hockey Safety</a>
      </font></h2>
 Ice hockey is a popular winter sport in the United States, with more than 
500,000 registered amateur players. But injuries in this sport are common 
and can be severe. Many injuries can be prevented if players wear all their 
safety gear and avoid dangerous moves like body checking (using the hip and
shoulder to slow or stop an opponent who has the puck). 
      <p><b>Tips for Preventing Ice Hockey Injuries</b> </p>
      <p>To help your child avoid injury while playing ice hockey, follow
these safety tips from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy 
of Orthopaedic Surgeons, USA Hockey, and other sports and health organizations. 
(<u>Note</u>: Adults should follow this guidance, too.)&nbsp; </p>
