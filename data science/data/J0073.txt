</CENTER></FONT>

<CENTER>Early on Sunday morning, November 19, popular Victorian motorkhana identity <b>Rob Allan </b> passed away, finally succumbing after a long battle with cancer.</CENTER></P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="rallan.jpg"></CENTER><BR>

Rob was well known in motorkhana circles throughout Australia, and his cheery presence will be sadly missed. His encouragement and support led many people into motorkhanas. A true family man, Rob had the driving and engineering skills to become State Champion, but derived even greater pleasure from Matt's State title wins, with Chris in close pursuit, and Sue's numerous Ladies awards.</P>

His latest Clipper Special (rear-wheel drive, of course), was a tribute to his attention to detail, and his battles with the top front-drive Specials will long be remembered.  Plans are being made to name the Victorian Juniors award in Rob's honour.</P>

The funeral will be held on <B>Thursday, November 23 (2.00 PM)</B> at the Drayton & Garson Chapel, 339 Warrigal Road, Burwood (Melway Map 60 H6).</P>

Our thoughts at this time are with his wife and constant companion, Sue, sons Chris. and Matt. and their extended families.</P><HR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#FF0000" FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN"><I>Thursday, July 6, 2000 </I></FONT>

<UL TYPE=disc>

<LI><P>Peter Deck (see <I>TASSIE ACTION</I> below) has issued a Newsletter with info on the Tasmanian Cup Series, so (with Peter's consent) we'll publish it here for the interest of all motorkhana enthusiasts and especially for the benefit of any travelling Tasmanians. </P>

1999 TASMANIAN MOTORKHANA CUP SERIES

<P>As many of you have heard, instead of the single event Motorkhana Cup that has been run since about 1984 (I think), very successfully by the MGCC, a 3 round series has been organised for 1999. Conditions for the Cup have been formulated and we will run under these for 1999 and see how they go. If they need changing for the following year I would welcome any feedback.</P>

<P>My idea of having a 3 round series is to try and foster, develop and encourage this branch of motorsport for the Tassie club level competitors because rallys, circuit racing and other higher levels of our sport seem to be getting too costly and entries are declining.</P> 

When I came here from the north island 21 years ago, I came from a scene where state rounds drew between 50 and 100 competitors. I was somewhat disappointed to see the scene here so quiet. With the necessity of  making a living in a new occupation being predominant, the Mini Special did not get cranked into life for about 12 years. However, over the last 4 or 5 years I have been getting around to a few events and enjoying the sport. There has been quite a bit of enthusiasm from  other competitors, particularly in the MG Car Club, and I thought the time might be right to get a State Series up and running.<BR>

<P>The idea of having so many classes is to give the rear wheel drivers a bit more of a go. There`s no prizemoney (or sheep stations) being awarded except for the perpetual  trophy for outright first (this seems to have Chris Ellis`s name just about permanently engraved on it!).To get prizemoney would require sponsors or a levy on the entry fees. The philosophy of this branch of our sport is to run whatcha brung and have fun. Wives, girlfriends, etc. as well as children (12 years and over) can have a go as well.</P>

<P>The first round will be run by the NWCC on April 17 at Wynyard Airport. This is also part of their Black Tack Series which has in previous years drawn around 30 local entries. You wont have to duck the planes as they use the other runway. The surface is good quality hot mix.</P>

<P>The second round will be run by the LCCT at Georgetown, in either the Comalco or the Temco car park according to club spokesman Kim Taylor. The surface again will be good hot mix. The date for this is June 20. The final round is run by the previous Cup organisers, the MGCC at their Kellyfield venue near Richmond, on dirt. The date is November 21.</P>

<P>On October 11,this year, I had the privilege of going to the Australian Motorkhana Championships at Perth WA. I had not been to an AMC for 21 years so it was interesting to visit the scene again. The specials have not changed much, all were still Mini engined. They were being driven harder and with more skill, but the big change was in tyres and wheels. Top competitors were spending around $2000 on sticky racing tyres and 8 or 9 inch wide alloy rims. These were so effective that the back tyres were getting about  30 cm off the ground when stopping in the finish garage. There were 116 entries of which only 11 were from interstate. Such is the tyranny of distance. David Beames from SA won his fifth title by .8 secs from Alan McConnell from Qld. after a day long seesawing battle among the top four in the twelve tests with flag penalties influencing the outcome. Beames got +5 secs and McConnell got +15 secs for hitting flags. 27 entries were in specials (some cars were double or triple entered).</P>

<P>The following day the National Motorkhana Panel met and I was there as your Tasmanian rep. The main decision taken was that from the beginning of 1999 it will be compulsory that the drivers of specials wear a CAMS approved crash helmet. It is also recommended that drivers of open production cars wear one as well. A new test booklet should be out soon with computer rendered diagrams and some new tests. It will also be available on floppy so that organisers can print test diagrams in their programs more easily. Considerable discussion arose over the definition of “significantly lightened” in moving production cars into the specials class. No agreement was reached among states so it has been left up to each state to apply their own interpretation. The allocation of the 2003 AMC was discussed, with the possibility that it may be awarded to Tasmania should there be enough interest  shown by an organiser and by one or more Tas competitors travelling to compete in the closer AMC events before then.</P>

<P>That`s about all for this newsletter, so it would be great to see a whole heap of competitors at Wynyard on April 17 and then for the rest of the series. If you have any comments, complaints, questions, news, or feedback you can get me at home on 64363233 ph/fax or email pedeck@southcom.com.au otherwise I`ll see you around the paddocks. </P>

<LI> Victorian enthusiast, Mike Fitzgerald, has spent much time developing and refining a SCORING PROGRAM for use by Motorkhana organisers.  The program has already been used for Victorian & Australian Championship Events and a variety of club events over the last few years.  To enable wider use of the program, Mike has now opened a web site at <A HREF="http://www.netspace.net.au/~fitzmfa">http://www.netspace.net.au/~fitzmfa</A>, from which the program can be freely downloaded.  This site is now added to the <A HREF="mklinks.htm"> LINKS </A> page.
<P>The program will score all types of events, allocating car numbers, then sorting results in outright and/or class or handicap order, as well as scoring teams.  A word of warning, though - there <I><B>is</B></I> a learning curve involved, and it is <I><B>not</B></I> recommended to use the program on an event without first reading the manual supplied and then trying a dummy run on some previous event results.</P></A>

<P>The intention lately (though it is not always achievable) is to have a different photo on the "cover" page each time an update takes place. This may not always happen over the next few weeks, as I'd like to keep the AMC logo to promote that event.  </P>
<P>Some people don't always get the latest update (perhaps due to the configuration of their browser 'cache'). The most accurate indication of an update is the date shown beneath the visitor counter - this reloads each time the index page is loaded. </P>

<P>Apologies for last week's cover photo, but its not every week your daughter turns 21! </P>

After two months "on the road" in Europe, its great to be back!<BR><BR>

Apologies to all the visitors the MOTORKHANA WORLD Wide Web during that time, but it wasn't nearly as easy as I had hoped to maintain the page from o/s, and in the end I gave up!<BR><BR>

There were 92 email messages waiting when I returned, and I'm pleased to say many of them were submissions for these pages.  Some will need a bit of work with re-formatting, etc, but they all should be posted over the next few days. 

<P><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000FF" FACE="TIMES NEW ROMAN"><CENTER>SUBMISSIONS </CENTER></FONT></P>

Thanks to everyone for their great support, and keep the info and messages coming!  News, coming events, results and photos are always welcome, and will help make this site more interesting for motorkhana enthusiasts wherever they may be.<BR><BR>

Submissions be email are easiest, but <I><B>please</B></I> try to name files in the old DOS 8.3 (xxxxxxxx.xxx) format so I can work on them either at home or at the office. The following are the preferred file formats (remember your files don't have to be written using these programs, just "save as" these file types before emailing them: <B>Documents</B> (news, coming events, supp. regs.) - ASCII text (.txt), MS Word 6.0 (.doc), MS Windows Write (.wri); <B>Results, Point Scores</B> - as above or MS Excel 5.0 (.xls); <B>Photos</B> - .gif or .jpg preferred.<BR><BR>

<P>Having done that, then just send your file(s) as an email to <A HREF="mailto:johnros@melbpc.org.au">johnros@melbpc.org.au </A></P>
