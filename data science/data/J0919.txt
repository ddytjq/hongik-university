<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Introduction</font></h3></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The February issue of the British magazine
*Rally Sport* contained an article on Tynemouth Computer Services, a behind
the scenes look at how all those results are put together for rallies having
up to 140 entrants. It also explains why we on Rally-L get them so quickly
after an event. Rally-L members will be pleased to note that our very own
(speaking of the Rally-L fraternity) David James features prominently in
the article.</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Article</font></h3></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Sitting in the press office of a British club
rally, particularly the BTRDA [British Trial and Rally Drivers Association]
stage events of the '80s when reverse seeding was used, you always knew
when the first cars were beginning to arrive back at the hotel headquarters
in the afternoon.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Not only was the noise in the bar beginning
to rise, but people began to filter into the results office to see where
they had finished in the Astra Nova Challenge or, more recently, in the
Peugeot GTI Challenge.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Keeping tabs on the performance of 120
or so cars over up to a dozen forest stages in one day is no mean feat.
That's why Martin Liddle of Tynemouth Computer Services is normally a very
busy and scarcely-seen individual during a British rally. But he's also
the man most likely to know what happened to Joe Bloggs's Escort in SS2,
how many road penalties have been incurred by car 26 and which was the
fastest Peugeot 205 crew on SS6. But how does he do it? And what does the
job entail?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">People have taken the British rally results
service for granted for years, but Liddle has been involved in the sport
from grass-roots level for over two decades and started out as a competitor.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"My involvement in rallying dates back
to 1965, but I suppose I was a better navigator than co-driver," says Martin
modestly. "My first event was the Queen Mary College 12-car event, organised
by London University, but I competed in many rallies in a variety of Minis
of various descriptions."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Liddle's education and working career had
kept him in the London and Cambridge areas until 1973, but a new position
in engineering saw him move to the northeast, an area which remains home
to this day. It was also through this link that he contested his last-ever
rally as a competitor, finishing second overall with Dave Lewis in the
1981 Riponian Rally in a Ford Escort.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Back in 1973, Liddle had joined the local
Tynemouth and District Motor Club and became involved in the organisation
of the Lindisfarne Rally, a round of the RAC Championship--initially in
a course car and then as competition secretary the following year.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In 1973, results of typical British rallies
were all calculated manually, using card collection, a telephone and large
sheets to work out specific penalties. Scrutineer Don Tarbet had been responsible
for calculating the results on the Lindisfarne Rally, but Liddle saw an
opening the following year and discovered that there was a computer time-sharing
bureau in London, which could be accessed over the telephone using a low-speed
modem.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We looked at the situation and decided
to give the system a go in October 1974. I envisaged a possible problem
with communications and dreaded the unreliability of the people looking
after the machines when we wanted to issue provisional results. The whole
operation worked very well, although it took a great deal of effort to
develop the crude software. It's amazing how simple it was then compared
with now. Anyway, we reviewed the success of the operation and thought
to ourselves, why just use this system once a year?"</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Liddle, who was now working in electronics
engineering during the week, decided to place a small story in the columns
of Motoring News and the telephone began to ring. "We used the system on
a little club event in Oxfordshire in early December and then I was contacted
by Port Talbot Motor Club to help out on the Virgo Rally over the Epynt
ranges at the end of the year."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At this point in time, the system was a
non-profit-making venture: it was not cheap to access the computers in
London and any surplus was taken up by Tynemouth Motor Club funds. Protests
and queries would delay the results and eat still further into the profits.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But the system quickly began to grow by
word of mouth and, by 1977, Liddle was awarded the contract for the entire
Castrol/Autosport Championship. Both Bruce McMichael and Don Tarbet helped
out on occasions, but at this point Liddle owned none of the hardware and
had already been approached to run the results service on international
rallies.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Tynemouth were a little concerned about
the risks of running the operation over a long period and I decided to
take over the business. I began to buy equipment to access the mainframes
and planned to buy microcomputers as soon as they became available. They
had been in the US since 1977, but I acquired my first models in 1979,
which meant that income from motor clubs was now going to be revenue for
the business."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Until 1979, Liddle had written and updated
all his own software, but the move to microcomputers meant that much needed
rewriting. David James, now 42, was employed to assist in the growth of
the operation and, for the next 10 years, both Liddle and his new recruit
shared the task of updating the software. James is now responsible for
updating software and making minor improvements to the system.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The whole operation has grown at an alarming
rate," enthuses Liddle. "In the mid '70s, the Manx Rally may have had two
computer terminals in the press office and maybe one for the spectators.
Now we're looking at 27 or 28 terminals in total on this rally. We own
most of them, but manage to scrounge a couple here and there. Most of the
equipment can be loaded into a very full Transit van and on a typical one-day
national event one of us would hope to arrive at rally headquarters during
a Friday afternoon."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Liddle or James will already have received
full details of the actual event at this stage and will have programmed
stages, bogey times, time cards, target times and penalties into the system.
"The software has been greatly improved over the years and it doesn't take
long to feed in this information. We use IBM PCs, running the UNIX operating
system instead of the more usual MS-DOS. This is because UNIX offers better
scope for using a greater number of terminals.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We use the PASCAL computer language and
our own proprietary software developed over the past 20 years. This is
also used by Ron Jackson in the Motoring News Championship and by Brian
Thompson in Scotland. The software was first rewritten for microcomputers
in 1979 and again for UNIX in 1989, but we are continually developing requests
and advice and have pages of recommendations. When we assisted Dave Whittock
with the RAC Historic Rally, we developed the program to cope with the
demands of scheduled timing."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Normally, Liddle or James will set up the
results office, punch in any late amendments to the entry list or the timing
of the event and ensure that all the terminals are wired up correctly.
Liddle stresses that this is a job for several people on an event the size
of the Manx.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"On a typical one-day rally, we'd receive
a phone call from the first PC at around 10 am. A land line is preferable,
but we've used mobile phones in the past, depending upon the terrain. The
individual at the PC will feed us times in batches of 10 and these will
be fed straight into the computer. Reverse seeding uses the same principle,
but it just means that we don't show the overall classification at this
stage. When all the times are in the system and the results have been calculated,
the information is fed to the press access system. We will also take a
print-out of the results and either fax or send them with a messenger to
a PC for use by the competitors."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But things can go wrong. "There are instances
when telephones don't work or you dial a number which should be manned
by a PC and find a lovely old lady on the line who's never heard of the
rally. But I've been very surprised. I assessed the element of risk back
in 1974 and can honestly say that I've never worked on a rally where we've
failed to get results out, although I remember a Tavern Motor Club event,
where Martin Clark was clerk of the course, and we were still accessing
the computer bureau in London.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The building had experienced a water cut,
because a working group had damaged a water main in London. The computer
centre had a stand-by generator for electricity, but the machines were
shut down, because computers those days generated a fair amount of heat
and there was no water available for cooling. The system was shut down
at 10 am and it was 3.30 pm before the main was repaired and the computer
was up and running. The event finished at 4.30, so it was touch-and-go
for a while!"</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Liddle always takes a back-up system on
events and has a spare computer and spare laser printers just in case there's
a failure. Either of the main computers is capable of running the whole
operation, but he admits that he and David James are quite adept at carrying
out emergency running repairs. The only scenario he dreads is a power cut
where the headquarters is without a back-up generator.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Tynemouth Computer Services has never professed
to being the first company to pioneer a computerised results service, but
Liddle is delighted with the success of the operation, which now caters
for the Mintex National, Mobil 1/Top Gear (except for the Ulster) and BTRDA
stage events. In addition, Liddle, 47, is involved in orienteering north
of the border, the World Veterans' Championship and the continuous development
of software, although he does recall that a system was developed by someone
else as far back as the '50s!</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"I've become so used to being away from
home, often for 30 events a year in the early days. But now, David and
I go to 16 or 17 events each on top of our full-time jobs. It's become
a way of life. David was working on the operation full-time in 1989 when
we acquired the UNIX programme, but we're continuously looking to improve
the system. We cater for several languages on events such as the Manx,
but the early German translations were not too good. The term 'special
stage' appeared as 'theatre platform' when it was first translated into
German!"</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The results service continues to feed competitors,
spectators and the press with accurate information--often only 20 minutes
after the event has finished and the final check sheets have been returned.
Delays can often occur on events like the Scottish, which may be based
in Perth, with stages near Inverness.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The single biggest advance over the last
20 years has been the automatic calculation of road penalties," says Liddle.
"There are more classes than there used to be, but I'm always looking to
better the system. It would be no fun unless we could become better and
quicker. I would like to see a system of graphics to highlight certain
aspects of the results and that is something we're looking at for the future."</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
