<H1>Errors in the Steady State and Quasi-SS Models</H1>

<P>
The Steady State model of the Universe was proposed in 1948
by Bondi and Gold and by Hoyle.  Bondi and Gold adopted the
"Perfect Cosmological Principle", and added the assumption that
the Universe was the same at all times to homogeneity (the same
in all places) and isotropy (the same in all directions).
At the time the Steady State model was proposed, the Big Bang
model was in trouble because the value of the Hubble constant
was clearly bigger than the inverse of the age of the Universe.
[Sound familiar?]  If the Universe is the same at all times,
the value of the Hubble constant must really be constant, so
v = dD/dt = HD has an exponential solution and the scale factor
varies like
<PRE>
a(t) = exp(H(t<SUB>o</SUB>-t))
</PRE>
Furthermore, since the radius of curvature of the Universe
can not change, but must expand, the radius has to be infinite.
Thus the Steady State model has flat spatial sections like the
critical density Big Bang model.  Since the expansion of the
Universe spreads the existing matter over a larger and larger
volume, but the density stays constant, the Steady State model
requires continuous creation of matter.  The average age of 
matter in the Steady State model is &lt;t&gt; = 1/(3*H<SUB>o</SUB>)
but some galaxies are much older than the average, so the
age of the globular clusters can be accomodated if the Milky Way
is older than the average.  The space-time diagram below shows
the Steady State model:

in red.  Note the continual creation of galaxies so the
average density remains the same.

The Steady State model makes some definite predictions.  The first
one to be tested involved the number of faint radio sources.
In the 1950's astronomers found that radio sources were typically 
much more distant than typical optical galaxies, so modifications
to the usual source count law due to cosmology were expected.  For
the standard Big Bang model the counts were expected to fall below
the usual "8 times more sources for 4 times fainter limit" law by
an amount given approximately by 1/(1+z)<SUP>4</SUP> 
where z is the redshift of the sources.
This law assumes that radio sources are conserved, so a given section
of the Universe has the same number of radio sources at all times.
Because the volume of the section was smaller by a factor of (1+z)<SUP>3</SUP>
at early times, the actual density of radio sources was higher by
a factor of (1+z)<SUP>3</SUP>.  The density was constant in the Steady State
model, of course, so the count correction factor would be given
by 1/(1+z)<SUP>7</SUP>.  The diagram below shows what was expected and 
actually seen:

</CENTER><BR>
The Big Bang should have a deficit of faint sources, the Steady State
should have an even bigger deficit, but the observations showed a
surplus of faint sources.
The Steady State model has no adjustable parameters to correct for this
error, but the Big Bang does.  The assumption of conserved radio sources
(CRS) can be dropped in favor of an excess of radio sources 1-3 Gyr after
the Big Bang.  Thus the Steady State failed the radio source count test,
while the Big Bang passed by "winning ugly" - introducing a new parameter
to describe a new datum.

The discovery of the cosmic background blackbody radiation came later,
and completed the death of the Steady State.  The Universe now
is not producing a blackbody since it is not isothermal and it is transparent
instead of opaque.  In the Steady State the Universe was always the same so
it never produced a blackbody.  Hence the existence of a blackbody
background ruled out the Steady State.
In addition, the temperature of the cosmic background can be measured in some
very distant clouds that produce absorption lines in the spectra of
quasars.  The neutral carbon atoms in these clouds are excited to an
excitation temperature that can be measured using line ratios.
These excitation temperatures are upper limits to the CMB temperature
and are shown as triangular data points at right.  
In some clouds corrections for other sources of excitation can be made, 
giving a direct measure of T<SUB>CMB</SUB>, shown as a round data point.
This data agrees very well with the evolution expected in the Big Bang
model: <EM>T<SUB>CMB</SUB> = T<SUB>o</SUB>(1+z)</EM>, which is shown as
the red line in the figure.  
Even if there were some unknown mechanism for producing a blackbody radiation
field in the Steady State model, its temperature would have to constant
as a function of redshift as shown by the blue
line and these observations reject this model.

The Quasi-Steady State Cosmology is an attempt by Hoyle, Burbidge
and Narlikar to allow for the evolution of the CMB temperature
and to explain the surplus of faint radio sources in a
Universe that is always the same over the very long term.  A
sinusoidal pulsation is superimposed over the exponential growth
of the scale factor a(t), giving the space-time diagram below.

During the previous large phase of the Universe, our past light
cone (in red) was very large, and this gives a large number of
faint sources.  Unfortunately for Hoyle, Burbidge and Narlikar
these sources are blueshifted -- as indicated by the blue tint
on the space-time diagram, and NO faint radio source has ever 
been observed to have a blueshift.  This data disproving the
QSSC model existed before Hoyle, Burbidge and Narlikar
published -- so the QSSC model was definitely an error by
formerly great cosmologists.

<H2>The NEW QSSC</H2>

<P>

WIDTH=480 HEIGHT=295 HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 ALIGN="RIGHT">
Hoyle, Burbidge and Narlikar have not abandoned the QSSC but have continued
to develop it.  In recent papers they have
presented a new version of the QSSC
that has a greater connection to standard physics.  In this model, there
is a creation field that gives an energy density that is <EM>negative</EM>
and scales like radiation.  This negative energy density becomes dominant at
high redshifts and causes the bounce in the QSSC.  The recollapse that leads
to the periodic nature of the QSSC is caused by a negative vacuum energy
density.  As a result the evolution of the scale factor is no longer
a sinusoid modulated by an exponential [the red dashed curve at right], 
but rather a considerably more
cuspy function shown in blue.
</P>

<P>
Some of what follows will be fairly technical, since many astronomers
will not want to spend the time needed to understand what the QSSC is
saying.  Given that the expansion rate of the Universe goes to zero at
a<SUB>min</SUB> and a<SUB>max</SUB>, and that the curvature is zero,
one can easily solve for all three of the relevant densities, finding
for z<SUB>max</SUB>=5 and
a<SUB>max</SUB>/a<SUB>min</SUB>=(1+0.811)/(1-0.811) that
Omega<SUB>vac</SUB> = -0.358, Omega<SUB>m</SUB> = 1.623, and
Omega<SUB>rad</SUB> = -0.271.  These parameters thus give a
deceleration parameter q<SUB>o</SUB> = 1.623/2+0.358-2*0.271 =
0.63.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>

<P>
<IMG SRC="./QSSC-a-vs-t.gif"
HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 ALIGN="RIGHT">
Given that the deceleration parameter is close to the Einstein-de&nbsp;Sitter
value of q<SUB>o</SUB> = 0.5, it is not surprising that evolution of
the scale factor a(t) from the last minimum until now follows the EdS
curve quite closely.  The figure at right shows the EdS curve in red and
the Steady State curve in blue.
</P>

<P>
Note that the new QSSC is accelerating only during the bounce.  At other
times it is decelerating.  Also note that the matter density
in the QSSC is about 5 times larger than most current estimates.
</P>

<P>
The units for the time axis in the figure are 1/H<SUB>o</SUB>, so the
time since the last bounce for the QSSC with the chosen parameters is almost
exactly the same as the age of the EdS Universe: H<SUB>o</SUB>t = 2/3.

If the QSSC is decelerating instead of accelerating, how is it that

Banerjee <EM>et al.</EM> (2000, AJ, 119, 2583)</A>
claim to be able to fit the distant supernova data that is evidence for
an accelerating expansion?  The answer lies in extinction by the
carbon and iron whiskers that the QSSC uses to convert star light
into CMB photons.  Since the QSSC has a larger deceleration than the
EdS model, it requires much more gray dust than the open
model and slightly more than the EdS model considered by
<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9811316">
Aguirre (1999,</A>

The figure at right shows the distance modulus relative to c/H<SUB>o</SUB>,
DM = 5 log<SUB>10</SUB>(D<SUB>L</SUB> H<SUB>o</SUB>/c), plotted vs redshift
for the models shown in the previous figure.
The red curve is the EdS model, while the black curve is the QSSC without
absorption.  The blue curve is for the Steady State model.  The magenta
curve is for the best fit Omega<SUB>M</SUB>=0.3 vacuum dominated flat
model.  The green curve is the QSSC model with one magnitude of extinction
per Hubble radius locally.  The green curve crosses the magenta curve at
z = 0.45, so it will fit the supernova data quite well.

dust needed to go from the EdS model to
the supernova observations is not allowed by the 
<A HREF="./CIBR">Cosmic Infrared Background</A>

be ruled out.

At larger redshifts the extinction grows quite rapidly.
Note that Equation (30) of Banerjee <EM>et al.</EM> which gives the
extinction as a function of redshift has a serious error which greatly
effects the answer at high redshifts.  But using the corrected equation
gives the DM vs z curves shown in the figure at right.
The black curve, the QSSC without extinction, shows the loop back
to low DM [brighter sources] during the previous maximum of a(t) that
the old QSSC used to explain the excess of faint radio sources.
But with the amount of dust required to fit the supernova data,
there is so much extinction through the minimum size epoch that it
becomes impossible to see anything prior to the minimum.

In the QSSC, the dust opacity in the millimeter waveband is higher than
the optical opacity, so the Universe would have to be optically thick at
z=0.3 for CMB radiation.  But the recent preprint by
<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0101551">Narlikar <EM>et al.</EM></A>,
which miscalculates the small angular scale CMB anisotropies, assumes the
Universe is transparent up to z<SUB>max</SUB>.  So if
Narlikar <EM>et al.</EM> is right, then Banerjee <EM>et al.</EM> must be
wrong, and vice-versa.  These papers cannot both be right,
since Banerjee <EM>et al.</EM> requires a high opacity while
Narlikar <EM>et al.</EM> requires a low opacity.
But actually both these papers are wrong.
Here is a
<A HREF="./0101551.html">
marked up copy [384 kB]</A> of Narlikar
<EM>et al.</EM> showing its many errors.
The Narlikar <EM>et al.</EM> model should give a small-scale anisotropy
in the CMB that is the Fourier transform of the two-point correlation
function of galaxies.  But the two-point correlation function of galaxies
is a power law, so the angular power spectrum of the CMB would be a power
law, and not have a peak.  Narlikar <EM>et al.</EM> just assert there would
be a peak without any reference or justification.

The nucleosynthesis theory in the QSSC leading to the standard helium
abundance is frozen in the 1960's, based on the eight-fold way or
flavor SU(3).  For some reason only up, down and strange quarks are
produced.  The suppression of flavor changing neutral currents means
that all the strange quarks decay to up quarks, leading to a large
excess of protons over neutrons.  But if one allows for charmed quarks,
or for all six quark flavors, then this proton excess goes away, and
one gets the wrong ratio of H to He in the final products.
