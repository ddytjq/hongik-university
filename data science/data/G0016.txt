<P>Around the world geneticists are now engaged in one of the
biggest scientific projects of all time. Known as the Human <!g><A HREF="../biogloss/genom-body.html">Genome</a>
Project (<!g><A HREF="../biogloss/hgp-body.html">HGP</a>), the aim is to decipher the entire genetic code
of human beings, and to try to understand the functioning of the
100,000 or so genes that make up the <!g><A HREF="../biogloss/dna-body.html">DNA</a> that lies at the heart
of every cell in our bodies. This project has been called the
biological equivalent of putting a man on the moon. Thousands
of researchers in many countries are engaged in this project,
and the US government alone has committed three billion dollars
to the effort over a fifteen year period. HGP research in the
US is coordinated at the National Human Genome Research Institute,
located at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.</P>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>Knowledge gained by HGP researchers and
by other gene scientists is giving us an unprecedented ability
to manipulate genes - what is known as genetic engineering. While
this technology may lead to new cures for inherited diseases,
and even (it is hoped) for many kinds of cancers, some religious
believers have been resistant to genetic engineering. Some have
even expressed the view that DNA is <!g><A HREF="../theogloss/sacred-body.html">sacred</a> and that scientists
are hubristically attempting to &quot;play god&quot; when they
tamper with DNA.</P>

<P>But if this view has received considerable media attention,
there are also Christians who see genetic engineering as in keeping
with their Christian mission. One of this latter group is Dr.
<!g><A HREF="../bio/coll-body.html">Francis Collins</a>, a leading gene researcher and the director of
the National Human Genome Research Institute. Dr. Collins, who
was head of the team that discovered the genes for <!g><A HREF="../biogloss/cystic-body.html">cystic fibrosis</a>
and <!g><A HREF="../biogloss/hunt-body.html">Huntington's disease</a>, is a devout Christian, having become
converted to that faith at the age of 27. Rather than seeing genetic
engineering as contrary to his faith, Dr. Collins considers it
as an extension of the Christian mandate to help heal the sick.</P>

<P>Likewise Lutheran theologian <!g><A HREF="../bio/ted-body.html">Ted Peters</a>, an expert on the theological
implications of gene science, sees no intrinsic problem here from
a Christian perspective. In particular, Peters regards the idea
of DNA being sacred as muddle headed. Why single out DNA, he asks?
It is just another molecule in our bodies, a very complex and
important molecule to be sure, but ultimately just another part
of our physical makeup. In that sense it is no more sacred than
say our blood, which is routinely manipulated by doctors. Consequently,
Peters rejects the view that genetic engineering is &quot;playing
God&quot;. Like Collins, he sees it as a powerful way to alleviate
sickness and suffering, and therefore something which, used wisely,
should have theological sanction.</P>

<P><A HREF="../media/dolly-body.html"><IMG SRC="../media/dolly.jpg"

HEIGHT="113" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></A>Yet there is no doubt that
some advances in gene science do worry many religious believers
- and also many non-believers. One recent development that has
caused concern is cloning. The first announcement of a cloned
mammal came in 1997, when the Roslin Institute in Scotland made
headlines around the world with their cloned sheep named Dolly.
Since then, other researchers have cloned cows and mice. When
news of Dolly hit the press many people feared cloning would open
the door to all sorts of evils. Could a dictator clone a private
army? Or perhaps himself? Would a clone be treated as fully human?
Would cloning lower the value of human life? After the announcement
of Dolly, President Clinton called for a ban on all scientific
and medical research into human cloning, and in February 1998
Senator William Frist introduced into the US Senate a bill that
would make human cloning illegal. Even some scientists are concerned
about human cloning, including Dr. Collins. While supporting research
into animal cloning for agricultural purposes, he believes that
&quot;this way of creating a human being&quot; is &quot;not part
of God's plan for our lives.&quot;</P>

<P>Both Collins and Peters believe that given the immense power
of genetic technology it is vital for people of faith to understand
gene science so they can be constructively involved in deciding
what we do (or not) with this technology. Like other questions
of medical ethics, there is no reason why religion people - not
just Christians, but people of all faith traditions, cannot be
involved in the ongoing dialog about this science and its applications.</P>
