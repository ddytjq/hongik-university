best instructors around and provides several advanced courses for seasoned developers.
&nbsp; This knowledge is available at a significant cost and might require you to travel
to their location.&nbsp; However, if you really need to know what COM is all about, it
might be worth your time and money.&nbsp; Or, you can just attend one of their sessions at
VSLive conference.</font></small></p>

<p><strong><small><font face="Arial">Magazines</font></small></strong></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><a href="http://www.fawcette.com/vsm/">Visual 
Studio Magazine </a>is a must-have magazine for any serious VB programmer.&nbsp; It is packed with
useful, up-to-date technical information.&nbsp; If you are interested in what is going on
in the contracting arena, you should definitely take a look at the <a
href="http://www.cpuniverse.com">Contracting Professional</a> magazine. Even though it is
focused on US market, it provides a lot of valuable information to IT contractors in
general.&nbsp; </font></small></p>

<p><strong><small><font face="Arial">Conferences</font></small></strong></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><small><a href="http://www.vslive.com">VSLive</a> </small></strong><small>is
one of the best known conferences for Visual Basic developers. The biggest
conferences are in San Francisco and Orlando, followed by the conferences in New York and
Chicago.&nbsp; With so many sessions and speakers going at the same time, sometimes it is
hard to tell which ones to attend in order to get the most value out of the conference.
&nbsp;There a several speakers that never disappoint in this area, such as Bill Vaughn,
Dan Appleman, Deborah Kurata, Francesco Balena and Ted Pattison, so their
presentations are strongly
recommended.</small></font></p>

<p><small><font face="Arial"><strong>Certification</strong></font></small></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><small>There are many opinions whether it is a good idea to get
Microsoft certification.&nbsp; Some companies are keen on it and some simply don't care.
You will just have to decide what makes most sense for yourself. According to MCP
Magazine's annual salary survey, earning an MCSE adds an average of $11,000 US to a
non-certified individual's salary.&nbsp; With appealing statistics like these, it's no
wonder that certification is gaining the attention of IT professionals.&nbsp; There are
many ways to get ready for a certification exam - instructor-led training, on-line
training or self-paced training.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/trainingandservices/default.asp">Microsoft
Training and Certification</a> site offers many resources in this area. One increasingly
popular way to train quickly is to attend a week-long boot camp like the one offered by <a
href="http://learnquick.com/">LearnQuick.com</a>. The course is super intense, highly
condensed training marathon.&nbsp; But these training marathons don't come cheap - most
start over $2000US, not including travel expenses.</small></font></p>
