    from what is now Lake Burley Griffin to its present location at Lyneham the club
    introduced a premier 2yo race. It was named the Black Opal run over 1200m.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">In its first running in 1973 the King of
    Babylon colt Rich Reward held out a determined challenge from Wanted Man to win in a photo
    finish. The following year one of only two greys to win was successful in the well named
    Royal Britannia (Royal Yacht - Port Joy) over Swashbuckler. Royal Britannia had won the
    Silver Slipper earlier in the season and later went on to stand briefly at stud.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">The first filly to win was Silver Shadow
    (by Minor Portion) in 1975 who later went on to win the AJC Warwick Stakes before a short
    career at stud where she only produced two foals. A second filly won the following year,
    Bianca who then went on to win the Reisling Slipper trial. In winning Bianca defeated
    Mexican Dream and talented galloper Romantic Dream.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">In 1977 the ACTRC attracted the first of
    its star gallopers to the race when Blazing Saddles (Todman - Lady Simone) took part and
    duly won from King's Frolic and Absolute Authority. Blazing Saddles had earlier won the
    VATC Debutant Stakes the VATC Merson Cooper Stakes, VRC Maribyrnong Plate and VATC Blue
    Diamond. After the Black Opal he went on to the Golden Slipper where he ranged up in the
    straight but was no match for champion 2yo Luskin's Star ultimately passing the post
    third. Retired to stud Blazing Saddles sired numerous winners including the stakeswinners
    Heat of The Moment, Blazing Keel, Crossroads and Beans in Australia. From 1985 to 1989 he
    stood overseas and sired the champion sprinter Mr Brooks who died tragically in the
    Breeders Cup Sprint. Returned to Australia in the 90s Blazing Saddles is currently still
    at stud in Queensland.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Gold Mosaic (Baguette-Emblem Girl) defeated
    top class filly Jewel Flight in 1978 before embarking on a short stud career. Star's Grace
    was the third filly to meet success in the race when she defeated future sprinter and sire
    in Zephyr Zip with Pompeaux third. Star's Grace was later the dam of Might Impulse and was
    pensioned in December 2001. </font></p>
    <p><img src="sormani.jpg" alt="sormani.jpg (18714 bytes)" align="left" border="2" hspace="10" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="335"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">The Biscay colt Nassau won the
    Black Opal in 1980 and defeated Zephyr Zing and Atlantic Flyer with all three colts going
    on to stud careers after retirement. After winning the race Nassau then won the Todman
    Slipper Trial and at stud sired NZ stakeswinner Alynda who also ran third in the 1986
    Black Opal.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">The very promising Chinese Treasure won the
    Black Opal in 1981 from Twinkle Kingdom and Forever Red. He went on as one of the fancied
    runners in the Golden Slipper and finished a close fifth but the run took its toll. On
    returning to the mounting yard he collapsed and died. Sired by Blazing Saddles the filly
    Beans was successful in 1982 defeating Miss Alaska and Chives. After retirement Beans
    started a long career as a broodmare and was last listed in New Zealand.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#008000" size="3"><strong>Golden Slipper lead up</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">By the mid 80s the Black Opal had been
    recognised as a Group 2 race and was one of the main lead ups to the Golden Slipper. Many
    winners and placegetters in the Black Opal had gone on to perform well in the Golden
    Slipper without breaking through. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">In 1983 Brummel Who defeated Rodeo Song and
    Rise before embarking on a lengthy stud career but only produced 37 foals. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">In 1984 the black filly carrying the
    Kingston colours in Spirit of Kingston won the race from My Gaunlet and Gin and Bitters.
    Spirit of Kingston was one of the best of her generation going on to win the VRC Oaks,
    Edward Manifold Stakes, Canterbury Guineas and Rosehill Guineas during her 3yo season. At
    stud she has produced 12 foals including Taheel Boy, Portland Pirate, VRC Derby winner
    Portland Player and Kingston Coup dam of Coup de Grace. She is currently in foal to
    Strategic.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">In 1985 speedster New Atlantis defeated
    Crossroads and Dream Lodge giving the Black Opal one of its best representatives in the
    Golden Slipper. New Atlantis had earlier won the Maribyrnong Plate, SAJC Breeders Stakes
    plus several other races and was undefeated going into the Slipper. Despite drawing an
    outside barrier he was still in contention into the straight but couldn't withstand the
    extreme effort finishing just behind the placegetters as another South Australian in
    Rory's Jester raced to victory. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">New Atlantis won the VATC GJ Coles Stakes
    as an older horse and returned to Canberra for victory in the National Sprint retiring
    with a record of 31 starts for 10 wins and 8 placings. At stud he stood in several
    locations in Victoria and NSW siring winners such as King of Atlantis and Newreale. He
    reportedly died a few years ago after suffering a broken leg. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Classy filly Just Blooming (Yeats-Ponsalu)
    won the Black Opal in 1986 before running second in the Golden Slipper behind champion
    filly Bounding Away. Star fillies Bounding Away and Diamond Shower proved her nemesis
    during Just Blooming's 3yo year as she consistently ran placings in the big Sydney fillies
    races unable to break through against the abovementioned fillies. Just Blooming has
    produced 10 foals so far during her stud career.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Maizcay was a speedy 2yo by Marscay from
    Corn and had won the AJC Breeders Plate and STC Silver Slipper during the spring. In the
    Black Opal he defeated Tennessee Vain and Dream Faith and retired during his 3yo year with
    a record of 9 starts for 4 wins and 3 seconds. At stud he produced the Group 1 winners Our
    Maizcay and Seascay plus the stakeswinner Sir Amadi but these topliners appeared too late
    as Maizcay was sold to Thailand to continue his stud career. Due to quarantine rules
    horses reportedly cannot be imported back to Australia after landing in Thailand. Blazing
    Sword was another who was sold before his Group 1 performers emerged. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Comely Girl (Marscay - Final Pick) was a
    speedy member of the Tommy Smith stable and had a very short career racing 6 times at 2yrs
    for 4 wins. She opened her career with victory in a 2yo Hcp before heading to the Black
    Opal where she defeated Regional Star and Dalkari. Then she won the Magic Night Stakes
    then ran a close second to Star Watch in the Golden Slipper. Comely Girl then won the
    Sires Produce before a third behind Full and By in the Champagne Stakes. She was retired
    to stud where she has produced 8 foals to date. </font></p>
    <p><img src="marksgain.jpg" alt="marksgain.jpg (20710 bytes)" align="left" border="2" hspace="10" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="341"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">The following year Mark's Gain
    (Biscay - Golden Band) won the race from Eire and Pound The Beat. Its was Mark's Gain's
    sole victory at her third start in a race. After losing form at three she was retired to
    stud where has she produced 8 foals including Dane's Reward. Mark's Gain is currently in
    foal to King's Best.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Unspoken Word (by Mr Illusion) broke the
    run of Sydney victories in the event when he defeated Lavinia's Prayer and Commital.
    Unspoken Word had earlier won the VATC Blue Diamond Prelude and went on to record 9
    victories during his 35 start career. Many of those wins were down the Flemington straight
    including the Group 1 Gadsden Stakes during his 5yo season.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Sormani took out the 1991 running for
    Queensland when he defeated the Victorian Prosperous Strike and Guam Bear. Sormani missed
    much of his 3yo season through injury but returned to the track to win at Welter level at
    4 and 5yrs. From his 6yo season he raced around country Queensland and retired in February
    1998 with a record of 75 starts for 15 wins 12 seconds and 7 thirds.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">1992 saw one of the most popular victories
    in the event when local superstar Clan O'Sullivan defeated Yachtie and Sparky Miss. Clan
    O'Sullivan (Zoffany - Blazing Bags) won 8 of 10 2yo starts and is thought of as unlucky in
    the Golden Slipper where he was run down just before the post by Burst. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">His owner Ken Jones Jnr supplied 10 coach
    buses to Canberra racing fans to travel to the 1992 Golden Slipper. Soon into his 3yo year
    he suffered injury problems which would ultimately restricted his race career to 20 starts
    and missed racing from October 1992 to Jan 1994. When he returned he had lost much of his
    brilliance but won the feature Canberra Quality Hcp before being retired.</font></p>

    recorded a further 3 placings before being retired after four runs at 3yrs. During a short
    3 year stud career before his death he sired many winners including the stakeswinner At

    usually run two weeks before the Black Opal gained a higher profile with the ACTRC
    offering a car and then a pair of cars for the trainer who could take out the race with
    the same horse. </font></p>

    challenge with then promising 2yo St Covet. After winning the Black Opal Preview St Covet
    then defeated Rosa's Path and Identikit in the Black Opal Stakes. He went on to run a
    close second in the Golden Slipper before winning the AJC Sires Produce. As a 3yo he won
    the Caulfield Guineas and the VATC Autumn Stakes before retiring after finding the
    distance of the Canterbury Guineas too far. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">At stud like Danger, St Covet only stood
    for 3 years with studmasters lamenting his demise as progeny such as Rapid Man, Kbenjar,
    Shalt Not, Sahara Covet and Star of St Covet appeared.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">In 1995 ridden by Lester Piggott the Opera
    Prince colt Zadok also won the Preview-Black Opal double defeating Ravarda and Arrest in
    the latter. After three runs as a 3yo Zadok succumbed to a stomach ailment his record
    standing at 10 starts for three wins and a second. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">Paint had earlier shown promise in racing
    well in Adelaide and taking out the VATC Blue Diamond Stakes before heading to Canberra on
    the Golden Slipper trail. Paint won the 1996 edition easily from Cashier with Master Jolly
    third ahead of Jacobite. He then went on to run second to Merlene in the Golden Slipper. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000">After winning the Up and Coming Stakes
    Paint was injured and spelled until the summer where he won twice in Melbourne. He had
    further problems before returning to form to run second in the 1999 Oakleigh Plate and
    winning a Flying in the spring before two seconds at Group 2 level including the AJ Moir
    Stakes. He won at Listed level in the autumn and then in the spring of 2000 was second in
    the Sandown Sprint. Another spell followed with a first up second but the leg problems
    returned and Paint was retired in early 2001.</font></p>

    to win from Wenders and Vocalist. He went on to win twice at 3 years but struggled to
    regain form in following seasons. He was sent to Adelaide to try and recapture form but
    only had two starts in the spring of 2000 and hasn't raced since. In 1998 the Rory's
    Jester colt Speed Week was too good for Splendid Horse and Paris Dream. He went on to win
