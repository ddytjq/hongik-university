<h1> Diamond Jubilee Debate Glossary </h1>
<p>

<p>

<b> BATSE: </b> Acronym for Burst and Transient Source Experiment on
board the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory.  The BATSE experiment consists
of 8 detectors operating together as an all sky monitor.  It has
accumulated more GRB data that all previous GRB experiments combined.
Interpretation of this data, available starting in 1992, has fueled
several different schools of thought on GRBs.

<p>

<b> Cepheid: </b> A pulsating variable star.  This type of star
undergoes a rhythmic pulsation as indicated by its regular pattern of
changing brightness as a function of time.  The period of pulsation has
been demonstrated to be directly related to a Cepheid's intrinsic
brightness making observations of these stars one of the most powerful
tools for determining distance known to modern day astronomy.  The
existence of of this period-luminosity relationship was a point of
contention during the 1920 Curtis-Shapley debate.

<p>

<b> COMPTEL: </b> Abbreviation for the imaging COMPton TELescope on board
the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory.  COMPTEL has detected several GRBs.
COMPTEL's positions for these GRBs are more accurate than BATSE's.

<p>

<b> Compton: </b> Short for the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the
second of NASA's Great Observatories.  The satellite was named for
Nobel Laureate Arthur Holly Compton, a physicist famous for his work on
understanding how high energy photons scatter in collisions with electrons.
The Compton Observatory houses four gamma-ray instruments: BATSE, COMPTEL,
EGRET, and OSSE.

<p>

<b> cosmological distance: </b> A distance far beyond the boundaries
of our Galaxy.  When viewing objects at cosmological distances,
the curved nature of spacetime could become apparent.
Possible cosmological effects include time dilation and red
shift.

<p>

<b> cyclotron lines: </b> Absorption dips that have been reported in
several GRB spectra.  The abundance and even existence of cyclotron lines
in GRB spectra is controversial. 

<p>

<b> EGRET: </b> Acronym for Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope on 
board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory.  EGRET has detected photons as 
energetic as 9 GeV as late as 90 minutes after the onset of a GRB event.

<p>

<b> galactic halo: </b> A spherical region surrounding
the center of a galaxy.  This region may extend beyond the
luminous boundaries of the galaxy and contain a significant fraction
of the galaxy's mass.  Compared to cosmological distances, objects
in the halo of our galaxy would be very near by.

<p>

<b> GRB: </b> Gamma-Ray Burst.  Plural is GRBs.  A burst of gamma-rays
from space
lasting from a fraction of a second to many minutes.
There is no clear scientific consensus as to their cause or even their 
distance.  The later is the main topic of the `Diamond Jubilee' debate in 
1995.

<p>

<b> isotropy: </b> Formal definition: identical in all directions (American
Heritage Dictionary).  The degree of isotropy of the
distribution of GRB events on the sky is controversial. 

<p>

<b> keV, GeV, MeV: </b> Respectively, acronyms for kilo-electron Volt
(10^3 eV), Mega-electron Volt (10^6 eV), and Giga-electron Volt (10^9
eV).  These are common units of energy used here to refer to the energy
of gamma-ray photons.  GRBs are known to be (temporarily) brighter than
anything else in the entire gamma-ray sky at energies above about 10 keV.

<p>

<b> neutron star: </b> The imploded core of a massive star produced by
a supernova explosion.  (typical mass of 1.4 times the mass of the
sun, radius of about 5 miles,  density of a neutron.)  According to
astronomer and author Frank Shu, "A sugarcube of neutron-star stuff on
Earth would weigh as much as all of humanity!  This illustrates again
how much of humanity is empty space."  Neutron stars can be observed as
pulsars.

<p>

<b> OSSE: </b> Acronym for Oriented Scintillation Spectroscopy Experiment 
on board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory.  OSSE has detected many GRBs 
with its shields at energies above BATSE's primary sensitivity.

<p>

<b> parsec: </b> 3.3 light years, or 3.1x10^18 cm.  kiloparsec: 1000 parsecs.

<p>

<b> pulsar: </b> A rotating neutron star which generates regular pulses
of radiation.  Pulsars were discovered by observations at radio
wavelengths but have since been observed at optical, x-ray, and
gamma-ray energies.

<p>

<b> PVO: </b> Pioneer Venus Orbiter. The Pioneer Venus Orbiter entered
orbit around Venus on December 4, 1978 carrying 17 individual
experiments, including a gamma-ray burst detector.  The detector
operated until August of 1993 when the orbiter's fuel ran out and entry
into the Venusian atmosphere destroyed the spacecraft.  The 15 year PVO
data base currently contains the largest number of observations of
bright GRBs.

<p>

<b> red shift: </b> The stretching of waves of electromagnetic radiation.
The shift of a spectrum to longer wavelengths.
A red shifted spectrum is a predicted effect of the cosmological paradigm.
The existence and degree of a red shift in GRB spectra is controversial.

<p>

<b> repetition: </b> The recurrence of a GRBs from the same source.
The existence and degree of repetition of GRBs is
controversial. 

<p>

<b> SGR: </b> Soft Gamma Repeater. Plural is SGRs.  These are gamma-ray
burst events which are thought to be distinct from classical GRBs by
virtue of their
characteristic soft spectra, short duration, and known repetitions of
outbursts.  Three SGR sources have been observed.

<p>

<b> supernova: </b> The death explosion of a massive star, resulting in
a sharp increase in brightness followed by a gradual fading.  At
peak light output, supernova explosions can outshine a galaxy.  The
outer layers of the exploding star are blasted out in a radioactive
cloud.  This expanding cloud, visible long after the initial explosion
fades from view, forms a <b> supernova remnant </b>.  Because of
their similar appearance, the distinction between supernovae and the
unrelated and intrinsically much fainter novae events were not
appreciated at the time of the Curtis-Shapley debate.

<p>

<b> time-dilation: </b> Stretching of time produced by relativity.
Time dilation is a predicted effect of the cosmological paradigm.
The existence and degree of time-dilation
effects in GRB data is controversial.
