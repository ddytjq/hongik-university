<h2>
Troubleshooting checklist</h2>
If you are having trouble, the following checklist might help:
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><a NAME="EntityCreate"></a><b>Creating an Entity Bean:</b>
<ol>
<li>
Did you remember to change the bean name to "<b>Props</b>" on the last
page of the wizard?&nbsp; If not, run the wizzard again and make sure to
do this.&nbsp; The wizzard offers "PropsTable", but in the tutorial we
are using "Props".</li>

<li>
Did you fix the PATH and <a href="Classpath.jsp">CLASSPATH</a> as required
by the EJB compiler and server?</li>
</ol>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><a NAME="EntityDeploy"></a><b>Deploying an Entity Bean</b>
<br>If you are connecting to the net using a modem, you may need your modem
to be connected while you are doing the testing.&nbsp; Even if you are
not using the modem, an "IP address" is required for your PC.&nbsp; The
IP address gets assigned to most modem users only when they connect to
the net using their modem.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><a NAME="EntityUse"></a><b>Using an Entity Bean</b>
<ol>
<li>
Did you remember to place the client Java files in a different folder from
the EJB Java files?&nbsp; If you placed the <i>EntityClientSample.java</i>
file (or your own test program) in the same c:\Ejbtut folder as the EJB
files, that may be the source of your problems.&nbsp; Create a different
folder such as "Ejbtest" and move the client Java files to that folder,
and build it there.</li>

<li>
Did you place the EJB jar file in your client's classpath?&nbsp; If you
did, did you make sure it is not the source file <i>Props.jar</i>, but
the generated <i>PropsEjb.jar</i> EJB file that you placed in the client's
classpath?</li>

<li>
Try changing the "localhost" to your actual machine name.</li>

<li>
Did you change the EJB port number from "2050" when you installed the Blazix
server?&nbsp; If you did, make sure to change it in the EntityClientSample.java
file also!</li>

<li>
When you were creating the Entity Bean, did you remember to change the
name to "Props"?&nbsp; The wizzard's default name is "PropsTable", but
the tutorial uses the name "Props".</li>

<li>
If you are writing your own programs to use the EJB but cannot access it
using the syntax "<tt>java:comp/env/ejb/Props",</tt> you may have another
JAR file in your classpath that also has the EJB classes (such as "j2ee.jar").&nbsp;
Remove the other JAR files from your classpath.</li>
