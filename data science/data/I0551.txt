    <p>The Football Supporters' Association have urged the game's authorities to</font><font
    size="3"> </font><font size="2">offer guidance and support to clubs and players to stop
    the recent outbreak of violent incidents involving players.</p>
    <p>FSA chairman Graham Bean believes that the huge pressure on top flight players has lead
    to incidents such as Paolo Di Canio's push on referee Paul Alcock and John Hartson's
    attack on Eyal Berkovic.</p>
    <p>&quot;I think it is down to the pressure people in football are under now,&quot; said
    Bean. &quot;If a team loses a game nowadays, it is nearly a matter of life and death
    because those stakes are so high, particularly in the Premier League. I don't think there
    is a great deal that can be done about it. I don't believe there is any one solution. It
    would be a cumulation of things.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;I would like to see the footballing authorities sit down with the clubs and
    players and say 'We appreciate the pressure you're under but don't forget there are
    billions of people watching you every day'. Football is a very emotional game and players
    must be very careful not to cross that thin dividing line.&quot;</p>
    </font><p><font size="2">Why the Football Supporters Association feels the need to address
    this issue on behalf of its members is beyond the comprehension of Our Game. Football
    Supporters are more concerned with issues closer to home, like Hull City, Lincoln City,
    and the progress of theri clubs in the League this season.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Premiership supporters dont find these sporadic outbreaks of
    entertainment disgusting, in the increasingly stifled atmosphere of Premiership football
    anything out of the blue is welcomed. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The FSA is the voice of the people, and should be standing up for
    supporters, not getting involved in petty player squabbles. They should use their power
    and resources to help supporters enjoy the game and their club more. If anyone should be
    addressing player violence it should be the PFA.</font></td>
