Future inductees plaques will join them.<P>	The sport of Guts started out the '80s very strong.  The Lightweights of Midland, Michigan won the IFT in &icirc;81 and there were several other large tournaments in Chicago, Marquette, Detroit, Toronto, and elsewhere.<P>	The Foothills team of California would take the Nachazel Cup out of Michigan in 1982, only to have it taken back by Hartland Michigan's Heartbreakers in '83. Hartland and the Detroit-based Cupola Bandits would dominate the 1980s and Cupola would go on to win nearly every tournament around for the decade.<P><H3>The game today</H3>	The IFT downsized in the 90s, with numbers of teams now into the single digits, and the five-man game becoming three-man  But the level of competition has never been better.<P>	The IFT was held in various locations in the Upper Peninsula-Hancock, Baraga, Marquette, Lake Linden-and the Nachazel Cup, is still given to the winner each summer.<P>	The cup is now mounted on a beautiful base made by Jeff "Fro" Warren who was on the Lightweight team that won the IFT in'81.<P>	The Hall celebrates the players, families, and friends of this great game.  We hope you enjoy it and come back to see the changes to the Hall and to the game of Guts Frisbee.
