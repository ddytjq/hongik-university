<h1>Previous Updates:</h1>
<p>NASA researchers have the strongest evidence yet that one of
Jupiter's most mysterious moons hides an ocean of water
underneath its icy coat.

<p>Europa, the fourth largest satellite of Jupiter, has long
been suspected of harboring vast quantities of water.

<p>Galileo has flown near Europa frequently since the
spacecraft began orbiting Jupiter and its moons in December 1995.
Pictures from those flybys show patterns that scientists see as
evidence of a hidden, frozen ocean.

<p>NASA is planning a Europa Oribiter mission to carry
instruments capable of providing that information. Magnetic
evidence for an ocean is possible because Europa orbits within
the magnetic field of Jupiter.

<p>Key evidence that the magnetic readings near Europa result
from this type of secondary effect, implying a saltwater layer,
relies on timing. The direction of Jupiter's magnetic field at
Europa reverses predictably as the moon's position within the
field changes.

<p>Galileo will
be inside Jupiter's magnetic field while Cassini is just outside
it, in the solar wind of particles streaming away from the Sun.
Scientists plan to take advantage of that positioning to learn
more about how the solar wind affects the magnetic field.

<p>An unusually pure cloud of young, fresh ammonia ice has been
found on Jupiter by NASA's Galileo spacecraft, the first discrete
cloud of ammonia ice ever seen, though the planet is known to
contain ammonia gas.

<p>The spot named the Turbulent Wake Anomaly, first discovered during Galileo's first orbit of
Jupiter, may be in the cross-current of opposing paths of
uncommonly strong wind, which pulls up ammonia gas from below,
forming a large cloud of ammonia ice.

<p>These clouds are normally covered up within a few hours of their
formation by unknown substances that attach themselves to the
ammonia ice particles.

<p>Planetary scientists have known that Jupiter contains lots
of ammonia gas, because the gas absorbs certain wavelengths of
light. Until now, localized ammonia ice clouds have
never been seen, despite the cold temperatures and the abundance
of ammonia.

<p>Closer examinations by Galileo's spectrometer instrument in
May 1999 and May 2000 revealed that the spot was a heavy
concentration of ammonia ice particles.

<p>A current flows around the Great Red Spot from east to
west. Behind it, the current eddies and whirls, just as a rock in
a stream creates whirlpools and whitewater behind it.This
constant tumultuous motion pulls up ammonia from below the cloud
level, creating fresh, dense clouds of ammonia ice.

<p>This spot will be further scrutinized by both Galileo and
NASA's Cassini spacecraft later this year.

<p>New pictures of the most volcanically active world in our
solar system show it also has surface activity that resembles the
accumulation and disappearance of bright snow or ice.

<p>The images from NASA's Galileo spacecraft include the
highest-resolution view yet of Io, one of Jupiter's large moons. Elsewhere on Io, plains appear fully
blanketed by the snow-like material.

<p>It's not frozen water like Earth's snow, but a sulfur-rich
material that looks like white snow. In some
of Io's active volcanic plumes, the volatile material apparently
even falls to the ground as frozen particles or crystals, like
snowflakes.

<p>It includes sulfur dioxide and
probably other sulfur-rich substances. On Earth, sulfur
dioxide is a gas. On Io, it can be either a solid or a gas at the
surface or a subsurface liquid.

<p>The textures on Io's plains suggest that some material that had
been solid has dissipated by sublimating from a solid to a gas.

<p>New images also add evidence that many bowl-shaped
depressions in volcanic areas may be linked to fracturing and
shifting of Io's crust, not just to collapses above underground
magma chambers, like the large volcanic craters called calderas
on Earth.

<p>The new images of Io are available online from the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, Calif., at: <a href="http://jpl.nasa.gov/pictures/io">http://jpl.nasa.gov/pictures/io</a>

<p>Galileo took the images during a flyby that passed within
199 kilometers (124 miles) of Io in February, and transmitted
them to Earth during the following eight months. To approach Io,
the spacecraft had to enter a region of hazardous radiation
around Jupiter.

<p>Researchers have been analyzing the new images
and are describing some of their observations during meetings of
the American Astronomical Society's Division of Planetary
Sciences conference in Pasadena, Calif.

<p>Heat from many of Io's active volcanoes plays a part in
redistributing the snow-like volatiles. A bluish haze appears at edges
of lava spreading from Io's Prometheus volcano.

<p>Still,
researchers are puzzled why, over many years, the volatile stuff
has not been lost into space or become concentrated at Io's
colder polar regions instead of being distributed widely across
the moon's surface.

<p>The new pictures raise questions about large depressions in Io's
surface. Seven of them form a chain that makes a
right-angle bend, and the angular edges of some of the individual
depressions seem to follow the alignments of the group.<br>


<p>NASA's Galileo spacecraft completes its fifth year of 
orbiting Jupiter today, continuing to send home new information 
after enduring more than twice the time in orbit and three times 
the radiation dosage that it was originally planned to withstand.

<p>It is heading back toward Jupiter after the most elongated 
of its 28 loops around the planet since entering orbit on Dec. 7, 
1995. As it moves closer to Jupiter, Galileo is making a 14-week 
continuous study of the planet's magnetosphere, a vast bubble of 
magnetic force that surrounds the planet and contains its 
dangerous radiation belts.

<p>The study began in October while Galileo was still outside 
the magnetosphere. The information being collected as Galileo re-
enters it will be paired with measurements taken as the craft 
exited the magnetosphere last spring.
     
<p>Initial science results from Galileo's May 20 flyby of 
Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede, will be presented at the fall 
meeting of the American Geophysical Union, beginning Dec. 15, in 
San Francisco.

<p>Several instruments and subsystems have suffered some damage 
during the mission, but Galileo is still able to collect valuable 
scientific information.

<p>Add Jupiter's moon Ganymede, which is bigger than two of
the solar system's nine planets, to the growing list of worlds
with evidence of liquid water under the surface.

<p>A thick layer of melted, salty water somewhere beneath
Ganymede's icy crust would be the best way to explain some of
the magnetic readings taken by NASA's Galileo spacecraft during
close approaches to Ganymede in May 2000 and earlier, according
to one new report.

<p>In addition, the types of minerals on parts of Ganymede's
surface suggest that, in the past, salty water may have emerged
from below or melted at the surface, according to a study of
infrared reflectance measured by Galileo.

<p>Third, new Galileo images of Ganymede hint how the water or
slushy ice may have surfaced through the fractured crust,
reminiscent of linear features on Europa, a neighboring moon
believed likely to have a deep ocean beneath its ice.

<p>They include the most detailed photos ever taken of
Ganymede and an animated virtual flyover of an area where a
smooth, bright swath resembling parts of Europa cuts across
older, more heavily cratered terrain.

<p>The new information about Ganymede is being presented at
the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union, beginning
today (Dec. 15) in San Francisco.

<p>The magnetic clues to a possible saltwater layer at
Ganymede are more complicated than earlier magnetic evidence of
hidden oceans on two other moons of Jupiter, Europa and
Callisto.

<p>A melted layer several kilometers or miles thick, beginning
within 200 kilometers (120 miles) of Ganymede's surface would
fit the data if it were about as salty as Earth's oceans.

<p>Ganymede is covered with lots of ice and frost, both in the
older, dark terrains and younger, bright terrains, said Dr.
Thomas McCord, a geophysicist at the University of Hawaii,
Honolulu, who has been using Galileo's infrared spectrometer
instrument to identify surface materials on Ganymede.

<p>Photos Galileo took as it passed within 809 kilometers (503
miles) of Ganymede on May 20 display details of a tumultuous
past, according to Drs. James Head III and Robert Pappalardo,
planetary scientists at Brown.

<p>Natural radioactivity in Ganymede's rocky interior should
provide enough heating to maintain a stable layer of liquid
water between two layers of ice, about 150 to 200 kilometers (90
to 120 miles) below the surface, said Dr. Dave Stevenson,
planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology,
Pasadena.


<h1>Current Updates:</h1>

<h4 align=center>GALILEO MILLENNIUM MISSION STATUS<br>
December 28, 2000</h4>

<p>NASA's Galileo spacecraft has successfully flown past
Jupiter's moon Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system,
while Ganymede was eclipsed in Jupiter's shadow.

<p>Engineers at JPL said that Galileo dipped within 2,337
kilometers (1,452 miles) of the surface at 12:25 a.m. PST
today. A passage during Ganymede's eclipse was planned in
order to observe auroral glows in that moon's thin atmosphere.

<p>"It looks like a nice, calm flyby," said Jim Erickson,
Galileo project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
Pasadena, Calif. "The team was prepared for problems, but
we're happy without any. And we'll be even happier once we've
passed this orbit's closest approach to Jupiter."

<p>Intense radiation near Jupiter poses a risk to the
spacecraft's electronics. Galileo's closest approach to
Jupiter on this orbit will come at 7:26 p.m. PST tonight.
Information about the status of the spacecraft at that point
should be received on the ground about 35 minutes later, via
radio signals traveling at the speed of light. The last time
Galileo passed close to Jupiter was in May 2000.

<p>Galileo has already received three times the cumulative
radiation exposure it was designed to withstand and has
continued making valuable scientific observations more than
three years after its original two-year mission in orbit
around Jupiter.

<p>At 1 a.m. today, mission controllers at JPL received the
signals indicating that the Ganymede flyby had taken place.
The signals had been relayed from the Goldstone, Calif., and
Madrid, Spain, stations of NASA's Deep Space Network, which
operates large dish antennas around the world for
communications with spacecraft.

<p>Galileo's camera and other instruments were set to
capture the flyby with images and other observations. If all
goes as planned, the data will be transmitted to Earth over
the next five months for processing and analysis.

<p>As of 9 a.m. today, the spacecraft had recorded 31
percent of the scientific data that its instruments had been
programmed to collect during this swing through the inner
portion of the Jovian system, from Dec. 26 through Dec. 31.
Besides studying Ganymede, Galileo is making more distant
observations this week of Jupiter and the moons Io, Callisto
and Europa. Some of the observations are planned as part of
collaborative studies with NASA's Cassini spacecraft, which
will pass Jupiter on Saturday, though at a much greater
distance than Galileo is from the planet this week.

<p>Gases in portions of Ganymede's thin atmosphere give off
a shimmering auroral glow as they are struck by electrons from
Jupiter's radiation belts. The phenomenon is similar to
Earth's Northern Lights and to what happens inside a
fluorescent light bulb. Sunlight washes out the glow, so
Galileo scientists took advantage of the eclipse to study the
glow for information about the chemical makeup of the gases
and the structure of Ganymede's magnetic field, which affects
the location of the glow.

<p>Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system, larger
than the planets Mercury and Pluto. It is also the only moon
known to have its own internally generated magnetic field.
Earlier this month, scientists announced evidence that
Ganymede may have a thick layer of melted, salty water under
its ice-rich surface.

<p>"Ganymede is certainly one of the most interesting places
in the solar system, and we're looking forward to see what
kind of new surprises Galileo may have to tell us about it,"
Erickson said.

<h4>May 23, 2001</h4>

<p>NASA's Galileo spacecraft today passed the closest
point to Jupiter of the spacecraft's current orbit of the giant
planet, and remains healthy as it heads for a flyby of Callisto,
the outermost of Jupiter's four largest moons.

<p>Galileo swung within about 460,000 kilometers (about 285,000
miles) of Jupiter's cloud tops at 10:33 a.m. PDT time, according
to engineers managing the spacecraft from NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.  Flying that close to Jupiter
exposes the spacecraft's electronics to potential harm from
intense radiation belts.

<p>"We have indications Galileo is bearing up well to the harsh
environment, but it is still in a challenging environment," said
Dr. Eilene Theilig, Galileo project manager at JPL. "As
anticipated, we are seeing an intermittent anomalous behavior in
the camera, similar to what we saw during Galileo's last
encounter five months ago. Prior to high-priority observations,
we plan to cycle power to the instrument off and on to decrease
the risk of losing images. Cycling the power has cleared the
intermittent anomaly in the past."

<p>Galileo is on course to pass within about 123 kilometers (76
miles) of Callisto at 4:24 a.m. PDT on Friday.  Galileo has
succeeded at more flybys of assorted worlds -- including Venus,
Earth, and two asteroids as well as Jupiter's four largest moons
-- than any other spacecraft, and Friday's will be its closest
yet.

<p>As of 2 p.m. PDT today, Galileo had recorded about 30
percent of the scientific data that its instruments had been
programmed to collect during this swing through the inner
portion of the Jupiter system. The images and other data will
be transmitted back to Earth over the next two months, with an
interruption of three weeks in June when Jupiter and Galileo
will be behind the Sun from Earth's perspective.

<p>The scheduled observations so far have included studies
of Jupiter's clouds in infrared wavelengths, to improve
understanding of the structure and dynamics of the planet's
atmosphere and distant observations of Io, innermost of
Jupiter's large moons, to monitor its volcanic activity. High-
resolution images of Callisto's surface are planned for
studies of how loose debris on the surface may be obscuring
some of the smaller craters.  Callisto is about the size of
Mercury, with a heavily cratered surface that reveals billions
of years worth of information about the size and frequency of
comets and other objects hitting Jupiter and its moons.

<p>Galileo has already received more than three times the
cumulative radiation exposure it was designed to withstand and
has continued making valuable scientific observations more
than three years after its original two-year mission in orbit
around Jupiter. Its nuclear electrical power source -- two
radioisotope thermoelectric generators -- continues to provide
power to the instruments, computers, radio and other systems
on the spacecraft.

<h4>May 24, 2001</h4>

<p>The camera on NASA's Galileo spacecraft may not be working
properly as the spacecraft heads toward Jupiter's moon Callisto
for a close flyby on Friday at 4:24 a.m. (PDT).

<p>"We are not totally surprised, because we knew all along
that Galileo might encounter difficulties from passing close to
Jupiter's powerful radiation belts," said Dr. Eilene Theilig,
Galileo project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
Pasadena, Calif. "We are attempting to get a better understanding
of the problem and to do what we can to minimize the loss of
images."

<p>Voltage readings received from the camera yesterday and
today are the same as when the camera was in a problem state
during its last previous flyby, passing the moon Ganymede five
months ago. During that flyby the condition was intermittent. It
self-corrected spontaneously several times and was also corrected
by commands from the ground to cycle its power off and on. More
than half of the 120 images taken during that encounter period
were captured successfully.

<p>This week, however, indications of the problem began shortly
before this orbit's closest approach to Jupiter on Wednesday
morning and have persisted in every voltage reading received
since then, even after the power-cycle commands, Theilig said
mid-day Thursday.

<p>"We may have lost the camera images scheduled so far, but
the bulk of the camera observations are tomorrow morning at
Callisto," she said.

<p>Other scientific experiments on Galileo, including infrared
imaging of Jupiter's clouds and a radio study of Jupiter's
atmosphere, have functioned properly during this pass through the
inner portion of Jupiter's system. Data will be transmitted to
Earth during the next two months.

<p>This is Galileo's 30th orbit of Jupiter since arriving at
the giant planet in 1995. The original mission lasted two years
in orbit, but the mission has been extended three times. By
repeatedly passing through the highly radioactive environment
close to Jupiter, Galileo has endured more than three times as
much radiation as it was designed to withstand.  Radiation damage
to an electronic component is the main suspect in the camera's
problem.

<h4>May 25, 2001</h4>

<p>NASA's Galileo spacecraft has successfully completed a flyby
of Jupiter's moon Callisto, closer than any of the spacecraft's
30 previous flybys of Jovian moons.

<p>Galileo's camera appeared to be working well from the time
it was given a command Thursday afternoon to turn off then back
on, right through and after the spacecraft's closest approach to
Callisto at 4:24 a.m. (PDT) today, said Dr. Eilene Theilig,
Galileo project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
Pasadena, Calif.  Earlier, the camera appeared to be
malfunctioning and probably did not capture some intended images
taken of the moon Io from greater distance.

<p>Other instruments appear to have worked well throughout the
encounter, Theilig said. "This incredible spacecraft has come
through for us again." she said.

<p>Galileo passed about 138 kilometers (86 miles) above the
surface of Callisto. The spacecraft has been orbiting Jupiter
since 1995. Its closest previous encounter came within about 198
kilometers (123 miles) of the volcanic moon Io in February 2000.

<p>Today's pass was designed to use Callisto's gravity to
alter the shape of Galileo's orbit so that the spacecraft will
fly near Io in early August.  As a bonus, the flyby gave
scientists an opportunity to point their instruments for a
close look at Callisto, a heavily cratered moon about the size
of the planet Mercury.

<p>"It appears Galileo is on track for a polar pass by Io in
August," Theilig said. "Because this spacecraft has already
outlived expectations, the flight team prepared for
contingency situations, but is always relieved to get through
without encountering significant problems."

<p>If all goes well, images and other data will be
transmitted to Earth by Galileo over the next two months, with
an interruption of three weeks in June when Jupiter and
Galileo will be behind the Sun from Earth's point of view.

<p>Intense radiation near Jupiter poses a risk to the
spacecraft's electronics. Galileo's closest approach to
Jupiter on this orbit was at a distance of about 460,000
kilometers (about 285,000 miles) from the giant planet's cloud
tops on May 23.  It will pass about 20 percent closer than
that to Jupiter the same hour it flies by Io in early August.

<p>Galileo, built at JPL, has already received more than
three times the cumulative radiation exposure it was designed
to withstand and has continued making valuable scientific
observations more than three years after its original two-year
mission in orbit around Jupiter.  The spacecraft's nuclear
electrical power source -- two radioisotope thermoelectric
generators – continues to provide power to Galileo's
instruments, computers, radio and other systems.

<p>The radio signals indicating today's Callisto flyby had
taken place traveled for about 50 minutes at the speed of
light and reached a large dish antenna at the Madrid station
of NASA's Deep Space Network at about 5:15 a.m. PDT. The
network relayed the signals to mission controllers at JPL.

<p>As of 11 a.m. today, the spacecraft had recorded about 90
percent of the scientific data that its instruments had been
programmed to collect during this swing through the inner
portion of the Jovian system. During the weekend, Galileo is
scheduled to make additional observations of Callisto and of
Jupiter's clouds.

<p>Magnetometer readings by Galileo during earlier flybys of
Callisto indicated that this moon may have a layer of melted,
salty water deep beneath its surface. However, unlike its
sister moon Europa, which is likely to have liquid water much
nearer its surface, Callisto shows a heavily cratered surface
bearing the record of impacts by comets and other objects over
billions of years. High-resolution images can help scientists
understand the bombardment history of the Jovian system.
