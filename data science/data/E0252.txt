                        <p> <b> Alameda, Calif., September 29, 2000 --</b> Perforce 
                          Software, Inc. today announced that SciTech Software 
                          has selected the Perforce source code control system 
                          to manage the Open Watcom source code base. The Perforce 
                          software will enable the large team of developers participating 
                          in the Open Watcom worldwide to have up-to-the-minute 
                          access to the latest Open Watcom source code via the 
                          Internet.</p>
                        <p>"Perforce itself has benefited tremendously from Open 
                          Source software, and we feel it is only fitting that 
                          we return the favor. We're especially happy to be supporting 
                          the Watcom C++ compiler, which powers a number of our 
                          platforms," said Christopher Siewald, president and 
                          chief technology officer of Perforce Software. </p>
                        <p>Perforce Software makes its Fast Software Configuration 
                          Management System available at no charge to bona fide 
                          organizations developing freely available software, 
                          such as Open Watcom.org. The Open Watcom code base consists 
                          of nearly three million lines of code. </p>
                        <p>"The Open Watcom project requires an industrial strength 
                          source control system, that's why we selected Perforce 
                          for the job, " said Kendall Bennett, Director of Engineering 
                          at SciTech Software, Inc. "SciTech uses Perforce for 
                          internal projects, so we know that it can handle the 
                          massive demands that the Open Watcom project is going 
                          to place on a distributed source control system." </p>
                        <p>Developers wishing to access the Open Watcom Perforce 
                          system can register at Open Watcom's web site to be 
                          automatically notified when it comes online. </p>

                          Open Watcom is the result of the Open Source release

                          three million lines of source code, represent one of 
                          the largest pools of commercial source code of any type

                          The project has already stirred tremendous interest 
                          among thousands of developers worldwide, who will use
