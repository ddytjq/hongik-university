        1. WHAT DOES MEMBERSHIP MEAN </b><br>
        <br>
        When you take a mortgage with the Society you become a member. Being a 
        member means that you qualify to vote on borrowing members ordinary and 
        special resolutions. This is further explained in the Society's Rules. 
        Please ask if you want a copy. Membership rights do not apply to customers 
        of the Society's subsidiaries. Who has voting rights on a joint mortgage 
        <br>
        <br>
        1.1 The first person named on your mortgage is called the Representative 
        Joint Borrower. The Representative Joint Borrower is the only person named 
        on a joint mortgage who is entitled to vote. The other parties to the 
        mortgage do not have voting rights. You choose the order in which the 
        joint borrowers are named on the mortgage. Full details of voting rights 
        and the procedures for the Annual General Meeting can be found in the 
        Society's Rules. Please ask at any of our branches if you want a copy. 
        Voting rights do not apply to customers of the Society's subsidiaries.<b> 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        2. RESPONSIBILITIES FOR A JOINT MORTGAGE</b><br>
        <br>
        All borrowers named on a mortgage are jointly and severally responsible 
        for that mortgage. It is each individual borrower's responsibility to 
        ensure the mortgage is satisfactorily paid throughout the term. Because 
        of this, if at any time during the term of the mortgage one of the borrowers 
        wants to be released from the mortgage contract you must contact us immediately. 
        We will decide whether or not we are able to agree. If a party to a mortgage 
        account dies then the mortgage is automatically transferred to the name(s) 
        of the survivor(s). The Society will need to see the death certificate. 
        <br>
        <b><br>
        <br>
        3. HOW THE MORTGAGE IS REPAID</b> <br>
        <br>
        Your mortgage can be arranged over a period of time from 5 years up to 
        a maximum of 40 years. The term of your mortgage contract is dependent 
        on your personal circumstances and the type of mortgage that you choose. 
        The various types of mortgage we offer are: Repayment <br>
        <br>
        3.1 This is the traditional method of paying back a mortgage and is sometimes 
        called a 'Capital & Interest Mortgage'. With the repayment method, you 
        make regular monthly payments so that your mortgage is completely repaid 
        by the end of the mortgage term. The term most commonly chosen is 25 years. 
        The monthly payment is made up of two parts: a) interest, which is the 
        cost of borrowing; and b) capital, which is the repayment of the sum borrowed. 
        During the early years of your mortgage your monthly payment will largely 
        consist of interest payments and only a small amount of capital. As the 
        years go by the proportion of interest and capital in your monthly payment 
        changes. In the later years your mortgage payment will consist of more 
        capital than interest. It may well be advisable for you take out a life 
        assurance policy that will pay off your mortgage if you die. Please ask 
        us if you would like us to help you arrange this. Interest Only<br>
        <br>
        3.2 This method is where you pay only the interest on your mortgage. The 
        amount you borrowed will not decrease during the term of the mortgage 
        and will be repayable at the end of your agreed term. The most common 
        way of repaying the amount borrowed at the end of the term is to have 
        a separate investment or savings plan, such as an endowment policy or 
        pension. These plans are designed to pay off your mortgage and are briefly 
        explained below. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have made 
        arrangements to enable you to repay the capital on your mortgage at the 
        end of the mortgage term. It is important that you regularly review these 
        arrangements to ensure that any policy you have set up is still on target 
        to repay your mortgage at the proposed time. Endowment Policy <br>
        <br>
        3.3 An endowment policy consists of two parts packaged together; a savings 
        plan plus life assurance. The savings element is designed to increase 
        in value and repay your mortgage at the end of the term. The life assurance 
        element is to repay your mortgage if you die during the life of the policy. 
        You pay the premiums for this policy to the life assurance company. Pension<br>
        <br>
        3.4 You can use part of the proceeds of a personal pension policy to repay 
        your mortgage. Tax relief is currently available on pension plan contributions 
        to those who are eligible. However, by using the funds from your pension 
        this will naturally reduce the amount available for your retirement. We 
        require a separate life assurance policy to be arranged and assigned to 
        the Society.<br>
        <b><br>
        <br>
        4. INTEREST RATE CHOICES</b> <br>
        <br>
        The following section briefly explains the main differences between the 
        most common interest rate choices that can be available. The range we 
        have to offer will vary from time to time and will be dependent on the 
        Society's products at that time. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Variable</b> <br>
        <br>
        4.1 As the name suggests during the term of the mortgage the interest 
        rate can go up or down. There may be lengthy periods of time when the 
        interest rate remains constant, or the rate can change many times over 
        a course of a few months. Each time the interest rate varies your monthly 
        payment will change. We will notify you in advance of the change. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Discounted</b> <br>
        <br>
        4.2 A discounted mortgage is where the interest rate charged is reduced 
        by an amount for a specified period of time. The amount of your monthly 
        payment will change if the standard variable rate goes up or down during 
        the discounted period. At the end of the discounted period the interest 
        rate charged on your mortgage will increase as agreed in the terms of 
        your mortgage. A discounted rate can have the advantage of you paying 
        a lower than normal monthly payment in the early years of your mortgage. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Fixed </b><br>
        <br>
        4.3 This is where the interest rate does not change for an agreed period 
        of time. Your monthly mortgage payment will not change during the fixed 
        rate period. If the standard variable rate goes up or down, the fixed 
        rate will not move. At the end of the fixed rate agreement your mortgage 
        will usually change to a variable rate. Sometimes the option of a further 
        fixed rate will be available. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Capped </b><br>
        <br>
        4.4 A capped rate mortgage is where we agree the maximum interest rate 
        that will be charged during an agreed period of time. If the variable 
        rate goes above the maximum rate you will continue to pay at the agreed 
        maximum. If the variable rate falls below the set rate you will pay the 
        lower variable rate. At the end of the capped rate agreement your mortgage 
        will usually change to a variable rate. Sometimes the option of a further 
        capped rate will be available.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>5. THE COST OF A MORTGAGE<br>
        <br>
        </b>You may pay some or all of these fees when taking out a mortgage with 
        the Society.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Mortgage Valuation Fees </b><br>
        <br>
        5.1 The Society requires a valuation to be carried out on any property 
        offered as security for a mortgage. There is usually a fee for this but 
        sometimes the Society will pay it as part of your chosen mortgage product. 
        A scale of Valuation Fees is in the leaflet 'Current Mortgage Terms and 
        Valuation Fees'. <b><br>
        <br>
        Arrangement Fees</b> <br>
        <br>
        5.2 The Society usually charges a small fee for the administration of 
        processing your mortgage application. The fees are in the 'Current Mortgage 
        Terms and Valuation Fees' leaflet. This fee may vary according to the 
        mortgage product you have chosen. The product leaflet will tell you the 
        amount.<b> <br>
        <br>
        Legal Fees </b><br>
        <br>
        5.3 You will need legal help to carry out the conveyancing of the property. 
        The Society also needs a Solicitor to carry out the legal work involved 
        in setting up your mortgage. We will use the same Solictors as you as 
        long as they are registered in the Law Directory, have a minimum of three 
        partners and the appropriate indemnity cover. If they do not fulfil these 
        criteria, we will instruct our own Solicitors to act for us. You are responsible 
        for payment of all fees and costs charged by the Solicitors and/or Conveyancer, 
        including those acting for the Society.<b><br>
        <br>
        High Percentage Lending Fees<br>
        </b><br>
        5.4 If your mortgage represents 75% or more of the price or valuation 
        (whichever is lower) of your property a high percentage lending fee will 
        be payable. This is sometimes refered to as an Additional Security fee. 
        This fee will be used by the Society to obtain mortgage indemnity insurance 
        to act as extra security for the Society. Such insurance will not protect 
        you if your property is subsequently taken into posession and sold for 
        less than the amount you owe. You will remain liable to pay all sums owing, 
        including arrears, interest and our legal fees. If a claim is paid to 
        the Society under such insurance the insurers generally have the right 
        to recover this amount from you. <b><br>
        <br>
        Early Repayment Charges </b><br>
        <br>
        5.5 You can redeem your mortgage at any time during the term. Interest 
        will be charged up to the date of receipt of cleared funds which is estimated 
        to be four days after the date of redemption. <br>
        <br>
        Sometimes if you pay off your mortgage early, in full or in part, an additional 
        charge may be made to compensate the Society for the mortgage not running 
        its full contractual term. The amount of the charge, if any, will be in 
        the product leaflet and on your Offer of Mortgage.<br>
        <br>
        <b><br>
        6. INSURANCE SERVICES</b><br>
        <br>
        We can help you arrange various insurances to protect you and your home. 
        These services include buildings insurance, home contents insurance, mortgage 
        payment protection and life assurance. They are explained below. You pay 
        premiums to the insurance companies for each type of insurance. Sometimes 
        the Society will pay the premium as part of the mortgage product you have 
        chosen. Reference to the product leaflet will clarify this. Buildings.<br>
        <br>
        6.1 This is an insurance policy that will cover the fabric of your home 
        against damage. Some of the more common risks that are covered include 
        fire, flood and storm. Insurance companies offer varying degrees of cover 
        at varying prices. It is a condition of your mortgage that any property 
        we accept as security is covered by a buildings insurance contract which 
        we have approved. This protects you as well as us. Contents<br>
        <br>
        6.2 This type of insurance covers the contents in your home rather than 
        the fabric of the building. There are many different levels of cover you 
        can choose. Mortgage Payment Protection.<br>
        <br>
        6.3 This insurance normally pays part or all of your monthly mortgage 
        payment, for a period of time, if you cannot work due to redundancy, sickness 
        or accident and cannot meet the payment yourself. Life Assurance. <br>
        <br>
        6.4 If you die during the term of the mortgage, this insurance will normally 
        be used to pay some or all of the mortgage owing to the Society at that 
        time. Occasionally a mortgage product will be available where we require 
        that specific insurance services are taken out through the Society. This 
        will be clearly detailed in the product leaflet. The Society will from 
        time to time offer other insurance products if we feel that they will 
        benefit our members. We will tell you when they are available.<b><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        7. HOW INTEREST IS CHARGED TO YOUR MORTGAGE</b><br>
        <br>
        If your mortgage is calculated on a yearly basis: Interest is charged 
        from the date of the advance to the date of the Society's next year end 
        and after that on the balance outstanding at the beginning of each financial 
        year until redemption. The Society may from time to time increase or decrease 
        the rate of interest which applies to your mortgage account. We will notify 
        you in writing before any change is made. You may decide to repay some 
        of your mortgage, in addition to the required monthly payment, before 
        the end of the mortgage term. If you do so the interest charged in that 
        year will be adjusted accordingly. This applies if you make any payment 
        of at least £1000 more than your monthly payment. The balance of your 
        account is reduced from the day you make the extra payment.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If your mortgage is 
        calculated on a daily basis: Interest is charged on a daily basis on the 
        total debt outstanding until redemption. All payments made will immediately 
        effect the balance of your account and the interest charged. The Society 
        may from time to time increase or decrease the rate of interest which 
        applies to your mortgage account. We will notify you in writing before 
        any change is made. Depending on the mortgage product you have chosen 
        your Offer of Mortgage will detail how your interest is charged to your 
        account. <b><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        8. CAPITAL PAYMENTS<br>
        </b> <br>
        If you make a capital payment of at least £1000 more than the monthly 
        payment you are required to make, you can ask for subsequent monthly payments 
        to be reduced, if you wish to, no matter which interest charging method 
        applies to your loan.<b> <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        9. CHANGES TO YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES</b><br>
        <br>
        A mortgage is a long term commitment and we approve your mortgage based 
        on your current financial and personal circumstances. If your circumstances 
        change during the term of your mortgage for reasons such as illness, redundancy 
        or relationship breakdown, it could have an adverse effect on your ability 
        to repay the Society. If you do experience difficulties in paying your 
        mortgage you must contact us at the earliest opportunity.<br>
        <br>
        <b><br>
