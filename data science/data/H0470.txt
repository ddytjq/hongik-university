<CENTER><H2>Injunction</H2></CENTER>

	Pursuant to the Court's Memorandum Opinion filed this date, the
defendants and each of them and all their servants and employees are hereby

Arkansas of 1981.  <p>

	It is so ordered this January 5, 1982.<p>



<CENTER><H2>Memorandum Opinion</H2></CENTER>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

	On March 19, 1981, the Governor of Arkansas signed into law Act 590 of
1981, entitled ``Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science
Act.'' The Act is codified as Ark. Stat. Ann. &80-1663, <italics> et
seq.</italics>, (1981 Supp.).  Its essential mandate is stated in its first
sentence: ``Public schools within this State shall give balanced treatment to
creation-science and to evolution-science.''  On May 27, 1981, this suit was
filed <A HREF="#1">(1)</a> challenging the constitutional validity of Act 590 on three distinct
grounds.<p>


	First, it is contended that Act 590 constitutes an establishment of
religion prohibited by the First Amendment to the Constitution, which is
made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Second, the
plaintiffs argue the Act violates a right to academic freedom which they
say is guaranteed to students and teachers by the Free Speech Clause of the
First Amendment.  Third, plaintiffs allege the Act is impermissibly vague
and thereby violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  <p>


	The individual plaintiffs include the resident Arkansas Bishops of
the United Methodist, Episcopal, Roman Catholic and African Methodist
Episcopal Churches,  the principal official of the Presbyterian Churches in
Arkansas, other United Methodist, Southern Baptist and Presbyterian
clergy, as well as several persons who sue as parents and next friends of
minor children attending Arkansas public schools.  One plaintiff is a high
school biology teacher.  All are also Arkansas taxpayers.  Among the
organizational plaintiffs are the American Jewish Congress, the Union of
American Hebrew Congregations, the American Jewish Committee, the Arkansas
Education Association, the National Association of Biology Teachers and the
national Coalition for Public Education and Religious Liberty, all of
which sue on behalf of members living in Arkansas <A HREF="#2">(2)</a>.<p>


	The defendants include the Arkansas Board of Education and its
members, the Director of the Department of Education, and the State
Textbooks and Instructional materials Selecting Committee <A
HREF="#3">(3)</a>.  The Pulaski County Special School District and its
Directors and Superintendent were voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs
at the pre-trial conference held October 1, 1981.<p>


	The trial commenced December 7, 1981, and continued through
December 17, 1981.  This Memorandum Opinion constitutes the Court's
findings of fact and conclusions of law.  Further orders and judgments will
be in conformity with this opinion.<p>



<CENTER><H2>I</H2></CENTER>

	There is no controversy over the legal standards under which the
Establishment Clause portion of this case must be judged.  The Supreme Court
has on a number of occasions expounded on the meaning of the clause, and the
pronouncements are clear.  Often the issue has arisen in the context of public
education, as it has here.  In <I>Everson v. Board of Education</I>, 330
U.S. 1, 15-16 (1947), Justice Black stated:

<blockquote>

The ``establishment of religion'' clause of the First Amendment means at
least this: Neither a state nor the Federal Government can set up a church.
Neither can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer
one religion over another.  Neither can force nor influence a person to go
to or to remain away from church against his will or force him to profess a
belief or disbelief in any religion.  No person can be punished for
entertaining or professing religious beliefs or disbeliefs, for
church-attendance or non-attendance.  No tax, large or small, can be levied
to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be
called, or what ever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion.
Neither a state nor the Federal Government can, openly or secretly,
participate in the affairs of any religious organizations or groups and <i>
vice versa</I>.  In the words of Jefferson, the clause ... was intended to
erect ``a wall of separation between church and State.''  </blockquote>

	The Establishment Clause thus enshrines two central values:
voluntarism and pluralism.  And it is in the area of the public schools
that these values must be guarded most vigilantly.<p>


<blockquote>Designed to serves as perhaps the most powerful agency for
promoting cohesion among a heterogeneous democratic people, the public
school must keep scrupulously free from entanglement in the strife of
sects.  The preservation of the community from divisive conflicts, of
Government from irreconcilable pressures by religious groups, or religion
from censorship and coercion however subtly exercised, requires strict
confinement of the State to instruction other than religious, leaving to
the individual's church and home, indoctrination in the faith of his
choice.  [<i>McCollum v. Board of Education</I>, 333 U.S. 203, 216-217
(1948), (Opinion of Frankfurter, J., joined by Jackson, Burton, and
Rutledge, J.J.)]  </blockquote>

	The specific formulation of the establishment prohibition has been
refined over the years, but its meaning has not varied from the principles
articulated by Justice Black in <i>Everson</I>.  In <i>Abbington School
District v. Schempp</I>, 374 U.S. 203, 222 (1963), Justice Clark stated
that ``to withstand the strictures of the Establishment Clause there must
be a secular legislative purposed and a primary effect that neither
advances nor inhibits religion.''  The court found it quite clear that the
First Amendment does not permit a state to require the daily reading of the
Bible in public schools, for ``[s]urely the place of the Bible as an
instrument of religion cannot be gainsaid.'' <i>Id.</i> at 224.  Similarly,
in <i>Engel v. Vitale</I>, 370 U.S. 421 (1962), the Court held that the
First Amendment prohibited the New York Board of Regents from requiring the
daily recitation of a certain prayer in the schools.  With characteristic
succinctness, Justice Black wrote: ``Under [the First] Amendment's
prohibition against governmental establishment of religion, as reinforced
by the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, government in this country,
be it state or federal, is without power to prescribe by law any particular
form of prayer which is to be used as an official prayer in carrying on any
program of governmentally sponsored religious activity.''  <i>Id.</i> at
430.  Black also identified the objective at which the Establishment Clause
was aimed: ``its first and most immediate purpose rested on the belief that
a union of government and religion tends to destroy government and to
degrade religion.'' <i>Id.</i> at 431.<p>


	Most recently, the Supreme court has held that the clause prohibits
a state from requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school
classrooms for the same reasons that officially imposed daily Bible reading
is prohibited.  <i>Stone v. Graham</i>, 449 U.S. 39 (1980). The opinion in
<i>Stone</i> relies on the most recent formulation of the Establishment
Clause test, that of <i>Lemon v. Kurtzman</I>, 403 U.S. 602, 612-613
(1971):

<blockquote>First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose;
second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances
nor inhibits religion ...; finally, the statute must not foster ``an
excessive government entanglement with religion.'' [ <i>Stone
v. Graham</i>, 449 U.S. at 40.]</blockquote>

	It is under this three part test that the evidence in this case
must be judged.  Failure on any of these grounds is fatal to the enactment.<p>



<CENTER><H2>II</H2></CENTER>


	The religious movement known as Fundamentalism began in nineteenth
century America as part of evangelical Protestantism's response to social
changes, new religious thought and Darwinism.  Fundamentalists viewed these
developments as attacks on the Bible and as responsible for a decline in
traditional values.<p>


	The various manifestations of Fundamentalism have had a number of
common characteristics <A HREF="#4">(4)</a>, but a central premise has
always been a literal interpretation of the Bible and a belief in the
inerrancy of the Scriptures.  Following World War I, there was again a
perceived decline in traditional morality, and Fundamentalism focused on
evolution as responsible for the decline.  One aspect of their efforts,
particularly in the south, was the promotion of statutes prohibiting the
teaching of evolution in public schools.  In Arkansas, this resulted in the
adoption of Initiated Act 1 of 1929 <A HREF="#5">(5)</a>.<p>


	Between the 1920's and early 1960's, anti-evolutionary sentiment
had a subtle but pervasive influence on the teaching of biology in public
schools.  Generally, textbooks avoided the topic of evolution and did not
mention the name of Darwin.  Following the launch of the Sputnik satellite
by the Soviet Union in 1957, the National Science Foundation funded several
programs designed to modernize the teaching of science in the nation's
schools.  The biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS), a nonprofit
organization, was among those receiving grants for curriculum study and
revision.  Working with scientists and teachers, BSCS developed a series of
biology texts which, although emphasizing different aspects of biology,
incorporated the theory of evolution as a major theme.  The success of the
BSCS effort is shown by the fact that fifty percent of American school
children currently use BSCS books directly and the curriculum is
incorporated indirectly in virtually all biology texts. (Testimony of
Mayer; Nelkin, Px 1) <A HREF="#6">(6)</a>.<p>


	In the early 1960's, there was again a resurgence of concern among
Fundamentalists about the loss of traditional values and a fear of growing
secularism in society.  The Fundamentalist movement became more active and
has steadily grown in numbers and political influence.  There is an
emphasis among current Fundamentalists on the literal interpretation of the
Bible and the Book of Genesis as the sole source of knowledge about
origins.<p>


	The term ``scientific creationism'' first gained currency around
1965 following publication of <i>The Genesis Flood</I> in 1961 by Whitcomb
and Morris.  There is undoubtedly some connection between the appearance of
the BSCS texts emphasizing evolutionary thought and efforts of
Fundamentalist to attach the theory. (Mayer)<p>


	In the 1960's and early 1970's, several Fundamentalist
organizations were formed to promote the idea that the Book of Genesis was
supported by scientific data.  The terms ``creation science'' and
``scientific creationism'' have been adopted by these Fundamentalists as
descriptive of their study of creation and the origins of man.  Perhaps the
leading creationist organization is the Institute for Creation Research
(ICR), which is affiliated with the Christian heritage College and
supported by the Scott Memorial Baptist Church in San Diego, California.
The ICR, through the Creation-Life Publishing Company, is the leading
publisher of creation science material.  other creation science
organizations include the Creation Science Research Center (CSRC) of San
Diego and the Bible Science Association of Minneapolis, Minnesota.  In
1963, the Creation Research Society (CRS) was formed from a schism in the
American Scientific Affiliation (ASA).  It is an organization of literal
Fundamentalists <A HREF="#7">(7)</a> who have the equivalent of a master's
degree in some recognized area of science.  A purpose of the organization
is ``to reach all people with the vital message of the scientific and
historical truth about creation.'' Nelkin, <i>The Science Textbook
Controversies and the Politics of Equal Time</i>, 66.  Similarly, the CSRC
was formed in 1970 from a split in the CRS.  Its aim has been ``to reach
the 63 million children of the United States wit h the scientific teaching
of Biblical creationism.'' <i>Id.</i> at 69.<p>

	Among creationist writers who are recognized as authorities in the
field by other creationists are Henry M. Morris, Duane Gish, G. E. Parker,
harold S. Slusher, Richard B. Bliss, John W. Moore, Martin E. Clark,
W. L. Wysong, Robert E. Kofahl, and Kelly L. Segraves.  Morris is Director
of ICR, Gish is Associate Director and Segraves is associated with CSRC.<p>


	Creationists view evolution as a source of society's ills, and the
writings of Morris and Clark are typical expressions of that view.<p>

<blockquote> Evolution is thus not only anti-Biblical and anti-Christian,
but it is utterly unscientific and impossible as well.  But it has served
effectively as the pseudo-scientific basis of atheism, agnosticism,
socialism, fascism, and numerous other false and dangerous philosophies
over the past century.  [Morris and Clark, <i>The Bible Has The Answer</i>,
(Px 31 and Pretrial Px 89) <A HREF="#8">(8)</a>]</blockquote>

	Creationists have adopted the view of Fundamentalists generally
that there are only two positions with respect to the origins of the earth
and life: belief in the inerrancy of the Genesis story of creation and of a
worldwide flood as fact, or a belief in what they call evolution.<p>


	Henry Morris has stated, ``It is impossible to devise a legitimate
means of harmonizing the Bible with evolution.'' Morris, ``evolution and
the Bible,'' <i>ICR Impact Series</I> Number 5 (undated, unpaged), quoted
in Mayer, Px 8, at 3.  This dualistic approach to the subject of origins
permeates the creationist literature.<p>


	The creationist organizations consider the introduction of creation
science into the public schools part of their ministry.  The ICR has
published at least two pamphlets <A HREF="#9">(9)</a> containing suggested
methods for convincing school boards, administrators and teachers that
creationism should be taught in public schools.  The ICR has urged its
proponents to encourage school officials to voluntarily add creationism to
the curriculum <A HREF="#10">(10)</a>.<p>


	Citizens For Fairness In Education is an organization based in
Anderson, South Carolina, formed by Paul Ellwanger, a respiratory therapist
who is trained in neither law nor science.  Mr. Ellwanger is of the opinion
that evolution is the forerunner of many social ills, including Nazism,
racism and abortion (Ellwanger Depo. at 32-34).  About 1977, Ellwanger
collected several proposed legislative acts with the idea of preparing a
model state act requiring the teaching of creationism as science in
opposition to evolution.  One of the proposals he collected was prepared by
Wendell Bird, who is now a staff attorney for ICR <A HREF="#11">(11)</a>.
From these various proposals, Ellwanger prepared a ``model act'' which
calls for ``balanced treatment'' of ``scientific creationism'' and
``evolution'' in public schools.  He circulated the proposed act to various
people and organizations around the country.<p>


	Mr. Ellwanger's views on the nature of creation science are
entitled to some weight since he personally drafted the model act which
became Act 590.  His evidentiary deposition with exhibits and unnumbered
attachments (produced in response to a subpoena <i>duces tecum</I> speaks
to both the intent of the Act and the scientific merits of creation
science.  Mr. Ellwanger does not believe creation science is a science.  In
a letter to Pastor Robert E. Hays he states, ``While neither evolution nor
creation can qualify as a scientific theory, and since it is virtually
impossible at this point to educate the whole world that evolution is not a
true scientific theory, we have freely used these terms -- the evolution
theory and the theory of scientific creationism -- in the bill's text.''
(Unnumbered attachment to Ellwanger Depo., at 2.)  He further states in a
letter to Mr. Tom Bethell, ``As we examine evolution (remember, we're not
making any scientific claims for creation, but we are challenging
evolution's claim to be scientific...'' (Unnumbered attachment to Ellwanger
Depo. at 1.)<p>


	Ellwanger's correspondence on the subject shows an awareness that
Act 590 is a religious crusade, coupled with a desire to conceal this fact.
In a letter to State Senator Bill Keith of Louisiana, he says, ``I view
this whole battle as one between God and anti-God forces, though I know
there are a large number of evolutionists who believe in God.''  And
further, ``... it behooves Satan to do all he can to thwart our efforts and
confuse the issue at every turn.''  Yet Ellwanger suggest to Senator Keith,
``IF you have a clear choice between having grassroots leaders of this
statewide bill promotion effort to be ministerial or non-ministerial, be
sure to opt for the non-ministerial.  It does the bill effort no good to
have ministers out there in the public forum and the adversary will surely
pick at this point ... Ministerial persons can accomplish a tremendous
amount of work from behind the scenes, encouraging their congregations to
take the organizational and P.R. initiatives.  And they can lead their
churches in storming Heaven with prayers for help against so tenacious an
adversary.''  (Unnumbered attachment to Ellwanger Depo. at 1.)<p>


	Ellwanger shows a remarkable degree of political candor, if not
finesse, in a letter to State Senator Joseph Carlucci of Florida:

<blockquote> 2.  It would be very wise, if not actually essential, that all
of us who are engaged in this legislative effort be careful not to present
our position and our work in a religious framework.  For example, in
written communications that might somehow be shared with those other
persons whom we may be trying to convince, ti would be well to exclude our
own personal testimony and/or witness for Christ, but rather, if we are so
moved, to give that testimony on a separate attached note.  (Unnumbered
attachment to Ellwanger Depo. at 1.)  </blockquote>

	The same tenor is reflected in a letter by Ellwanger to Mary Ann
Miller, a member of FLAG (Family, Life, America under God) who lobbied the
Arkansas Legislature in favor of Act 590:

<blockquote> ... we'd like to suggest that you and your co-workers be very
cautious about mixing creation-science with creation-religion ... Please
urge your co-workers not to allow themselves to get sucked into the
``religion'' trap of mixing the two together, for such mixing does
incalculable harm to the legislative thrust.  It could even bring public
opinion to bear adversely upon the higher courts that will eventually have
to pass judgment on the constitutionality of this new law.  (Ex. 1 to
Miller Depo.)  </blockquote>

	Perhaps most interesting, however, is Mr. Ellwanger's testimony in
his deposition as to his strategy for having the model act implemented:

<blockquote> Q.  You're trying to play on other people's religious
motives.<p>

A.  I'm trying to play on their emotions, love, hate, their likes,
dislikes, because I don't know any other way to involve, to get humans to
become involved in human endeavors.  I see emotions as being a healthy and
legitimate means off getting people's feelings into action, and ... I
believe that the predominance of population in America that represents the
greatest potential for taking some kind of action in this area is a
Christian community.  I see the Jewish community as far less potential in
taking action ... but I've seen a lot of interest among Christians and I
feel, why not exploit that to get the bill going if that's what it takes.
(Ellwanger Depo. at 146-147).  </blockquote>

	Mr. Ellwanger's ultimate purpose is revealed in the closing of his
letter to Mr. Tom Bethell: ``Perhaps all this is old hat to you, Tom, and
if so, I'd appreciate your telling me so and perhaps where you've heard it
before -- the idea of killing evolution instead of playing these debating
games that we've been playing for nigh over a decade already.''
(Unnumbered attachment to Ellwanger Depo. at 3.)<p>


	It was out of this milieu that Act 590 emerged.  The Reverend
W. A. Blount, a Biblical literalist who is a pastor of a church in the
Little Rock area and was, in February, 1981, chairman of the Greater Little
Rock Evangelical Fellowship, was among those who received a copy of the
model act from Ellwanger <A HREF="#12">(12)</a>.<p>


	At Reverend Blount's request, the Evangelical Fellowship
unanimously adopted a resolution to seek an introduction of Ellwanger's act
in the Arkansas Legislature.  A committee composed of two ministers, Curtis
Thomas and W. A. Young, was appointed to implement the resolution.  Thomas
obtained from Ellwanger a revised copy of the model act which he
transmitted to Carl Hunt, a business associate of Senator James L. Holsted,
with the request that Hunt prevail upon Holsted to introduce the act.<p>


	Holsted, a self-described ``born again'' Christian Fundamentalist,
introduced the act in the Arkansas Senate.  He did not consult the State
Department of Education, scientists, science educators or the Arkansas
Attorney General <A HREF="#13">(13)</a>.  The Act was not referred to any
Senate committee for hearing and was passed after only a few minutes'
discussion on the Senate floor.  In the House of Representatives, the bill
was referred to the Education Committee which conducted a perfunctory
fifteen minute hearing.  No scientist testified at the hearing, nor was any
representative form the State Department of Education called to testify.<p>


	Ellwanger's model act was enacted into law in Arkansas as Act 590
with amendment or modification other than minor typographical changes.  The
legislative ``finding of fact'' in Ellwanger's act and Act 590 are
identical, although no meaningful fact-finding was employed the General
Assembly.<p>


	Ellwanger's efforts in preparation of the model act and campaign
for its adoption in the states were motivated by his opposition to the
theory of evolution and his desire to see the Biblical version of creation
taught in the public schools.  There is no evidence that the pastors,
Blount, Thomas, Young, or The Greater Little Rock Evangelical Fellowship
were motivated by anything other than their religious convictions when
proposing its adoption or during their lobbying efforts in its behalf.
Senator Holsted's sponsorship and lobbying efforts in behalf of the Act
were motivated solely by his religious beliefs and desire to see the
Biblical version of creation taught in the public schools <A
HREF="#14">(14)</a>.<p>


	The State of Arkansas, like a number of states whose citizens have
relatively homogeneous religious beliefs, has a long history of official
opposition to evolution which is motivated by adherence to Fundamentalist
beliefs in the inerrancy of the Book of Genesis.  This history is
documented in Justice Fortas' opinion in <i>Epperson v. Arkansas</i>, 393
U.S. 97 (1968), which struck down Initiated Act 1 of 1929,
Ark. Stat. Ann. &&80-1627-1628, prohibiting the teaching of the theory of
evolution.  To this same tradition may be attributed Initiated Act 1 of
1930, Ark. Stat. Ann. &80-1606 (Repl. 1980), requiring ``the reverent daily
reading of a portion of the English Bible'' in every public school
classroom in the State <A HREF="#15">(15)</a>.<p>


	It is true, as defendants argue, that courts should look to
legislative statements of a statutes purpose in Establishment Clause cases
and accord such pronouncements great deference.  See, e.g., <i>Committee
for Public Education & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist</I>, 413 U.S. 756, 773
(1973) and <i>McGowan v. Maryland</i>, 366 U.S. 420, 445 (1961).
Defendants also correctly state the principle that remarks by the sponsor
or author of a bill are not considered controlling in analyzing legislative
intent.  See, e.g., <i>United States v. Emmons</i>, 410 U.S. 396 (1973) and
<i>Chrysler Corp v. Brown</I>, 441 U.S. 281 (1979).<p>


	Courts are not bound, however, by legislative statements of purpose
or legislative disclaimers.  <i>Stone v. Graham</i>, 449 U.S. 39 (1980);
<i>Abbington School Dist. v. Schempp</i>, 374 U.S. 203 (1963).  In
determining the legislative purpose of a statute, courts may consider
evidence of the historical context of the Act, <i>Epperson v. Arkansas</i>,
393 U.S. 97 (1968), the specific sequence of events leading up to passage
of the Act, departures from normal procedural sequences, substantive
departures from the normal, <i>Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan
Housing Corp.</i>, 429 U.S. 252 (1977), and contemporaneous statements of
the legislative sponsor, <i>Fed. Energy Admin. v. Algonquin SNG Inc.</i>
426 U.S. 548, 564 (1976).<p>


	The unusual circumstances surrounding the passage of Act 590, as
well as the substantive law of the First Amendment warrant an inquiry into
the stated legislative purposes.  The author of the Act has publicly
proclaimed the sectarian purpose of the proposal.  The Arkansas residents
who sought legislative sponsorship of the bill did so for a purely
sectarian purpose.  These circumstances alone may not be particularly
persuasive, but when considered with the publicly announced motives of the
legislative sponsor made contemporaneously with the legislative process;
the lack of any legislative investigation, debate or consultation with any
educators or scientists; the unprecedented intrusion in school curriculum
<A HREF="#16">(16)</a>; and official history of the State of Arkansas on
the subject, it is obvious that the statement of purpose has little, if
any, support in fact.  The State failed to produce any evidence which would
warrant an inference or conclusion that at any point in the process anyone
considered the legitimate educational value of the Act.  It was simply and
purely an effort to introduce the Biblical version of creation into the
public school curricula.  The only inference which can be drawn from these
circumstances is that the Act was passed with the specific purpose by the
General Assembly of advancing religion.  The Act therefore fails the first
prong of the three-pronged test, that of secular legislative purpose, as
articulated in <i>Lemon v. Kurtzman, supra</I>, and <i>Stone v. Graham,
supra</i>.<p>



<CENTER><H2>III</H2></CENTER>

	If the defendants are correct and the Court is limited to an
examination of the language of the Act, the evidence is overwhelming that
both the purpose and effect of Act 590 is the advancement of religion in
the public schools.<p>

	Section 4 of the Act provides:

<blockquote>
Definitions, as used in this Act:<p>

(a) ``Creation-science'' means the scientific evidences for creation and
inferences from those scientific evidences.  Creation-science includes the
scientific evidences and related inferences that indicate: (1) Sudden
creation of the universe, energy, and life from nothing; (2) The
insufficiency of mutation and natural selection in bringing about
development of all living kinds from a single organism; (3) Changes only
within fixed limits of originally created kinds of plants and animals; (4)
Separate ancestry for man and apes; (5) Explanation of the earth's geology
by catastrophism, including the occurrence of a worldwide flood; and (6) A
relatively recent inception of the earth and living kinds.<p>


 (b) ``Evolution-science'' means the scientific evidences for evolution and
inferences from those scientific evidences.  Evolution-science includes the
scientific evidences and related inferences that indicate: (1) Emergence by
naturalistic processes of the universe from disordered matter and emergence
of life from nonlife; (2) The sufficiency of mutation and natural selection
in bringing about development of present living kinds from simple earlier
kinds; (3) Emergence by mutation and natural selection of present living
kinds from simple earlier kinds; (4) Emergence of man from a common
ancestor with apes; (5) Explanation of the earth's geology and the
evolutionary sequence by uniformitarianism; and (6) An inception several
billion years ago of the earth and somewhat later of life.<p>


 (c) ``Public schools'' means public secondary and elementary schools.

	The evidence establishes that the definition of ``creation
science'' contained in 4(a) has as its unmentioned reference the first 11
chapters of the Book of Genesis.  Among the many creation epics in human
history, the account of sudden creation from nothing, or <i>creatio ex
nihilo</i>, and subsequent destruction of the world by flood is unique to
Genesis.  The concepts of 4(a) are the literal Fundamentalists' view of
Genesis.  Section 4(a) is unquestionably a statement of religion, with the
exception of 4(a)(2) which is a negative thrust aimed at what the
creationists understand to be the theory of evolution <A
HREF="#17">(17)</a>.<p>


	Both the concepts and wording of Section 4(a) convey an inescapable
religiosity.  Section 4(a)(1) describes ``sudden creation of the universe,
energy and life from nothing.''  Every theologian who testified, including
defense witnesses, expressed the opinion that the statement referred to a
supernatural creation which was performed by God.<p>


	Defendants argue that : (1) the fact that 4(a) conveys idea similar
to the literal interpretation of Genesis does not make it conclusively a
statement of religion; (2) that reference to a creation from nothing is not
necessarily a religious concept since the Act only suggests a creator who
has power, intelligence and a sense of design and not necessarily the
attributes of love, compassion and justice <A HREF="#18">(18)</a>; and (3)
that simply teaching about the concept of a creator is not a religious
exercise unless the student is required to make a commitment to the concept
of a creator.  <p>


	The evidence fully answers these arguments.  The idea of 4(a)(1)
are not merely similar to the literal interpretation of Genesis; they are
identical and parallel to no other story of creation <A
HREF="#19">(19)</a>.<p>


	The argument that creation from nothing in 4(a)(1) does not involve
a supernatural deity has no evidentiary or rational support.  To the
contrary, ``creation out of nothing'' is a concept unique to Western
religions.  In traditional Western religious thought, the conception of a
creator of the world is a conception of God.  Indeed, creation of the world
``out of nothing'' is the ultimate religious statement because God is the
only actor.  As Dr. Langdon Gilkey noted, the Act refers to one who has the
power to bring all the universe into existence from no0thing.  The only
``one'' who has this power is God <A HREF="#20">(20)</a>.<p>


	The leading creationist writers, Morris and Gish, acknowledge that
the idea of creation described in 4(a)(1) is the concept of creation by God
and make no pretense to the contrary <A HREF="#21">(21)</a>.  The idea of
sudden creation from nothing, or <i> creatio ex nihilo</i>, is an
inherently religious concept.  (Vawter, Gilkey, Geisler, Ayala, Blount,
Hicks.)<p>


	The argument advanced by defendants' witness, Dr. Norman Geisler,
that teaching the existence of God is not religious unless the teaching
seeks a commitment, is contrary to common understanding and contradicts
settled case law.  <i>Stone v. Graham</i>, 449 U.S. 39 (1980), <i>Abbington
School District v. Schempp</I>, 374 U.S. 203, 222 (1963).<p>


	The facts that creation science is inspired by the Book of Genesis
and that Section 4(a) is consistent with a literal interpretation of
Genesis leave no doubt that a major effect of the Act is the advancement of
particular religious beliefs.  The legal impact of this conclusion will be
discussed further at the conclusion of the Court's evaluation of the
scientific merit of creation science.<p>



<CENTER><H2>IV(A)</H2></CENTER>


	The approach to teaching ``creation science'' and
``evolution-science'' found in Act 590 is identical to the two-model
approach espoused by the Institute for Creation Research and is taken
almost verbatim from ICR writings.  It is an extension of Fundamentalists'
view that one must either accept the literal interpretation of Genesis or
else believe in the godless system of evolution.<p>


	The two model approach of the creationists is simply a contrived
dualism <A HREF="#22">(22)</a> which has not scientific factual basis or
legitimate educational purpose.  It assumes only two explanations for the
origins of life and existence of man, plants and animals: it was either the
work of a creator or it was not.  Application of these two models,
according to creationists, and the defendants, dictates that all scientific
evidence which fails to support the theory of evolution is necessarily
scientific evidence in support of creationism and is, therefore, creation
science ``evidence'' in support of Section 4(a).<p>


<CENTER><H2>IV(B)</H2></CENTER>

	The emphasis on origins as an aspect of the theory of evolution is
peculiar to the creationist literature.  Although the subject of origins of
life is within the province of biology, the scientific community does not
consider origins of life a part of evolutionary theory.  The theory of
evolution assumes the existence of life and is directed to an explanation
of <i> how</I> life evolved.  Evolution does not presuppose the absence of
a creator or God and the plain inference conveyed by Section 4 is erroneous
<A HREF="#23">(23)</a>.<p>


	As a statement of the theory of evolution, Section 4(b) is simply a
hodgepodge of limited assertions, many of which are factually inaccurate.<p>


	For example, although 4(b)(2) asserts, as a tenet of evolutionary
theory, ``sufficiency of mutation and natural selection in bringing about
development of present living kinds from simple earlier kinds,'' Drs. Ayala
and Gould both stated that biologists know that these two processes do not
account for all significant evolutionary change.  The testified to such
phenomena as recombination, the founder effect, genetic drift and the
theory of punctuated equilibrium, which are believed to play important
evolutionary roles.  Section 4(b) omits any reference to these.  Moreover,
4(b) utilizes the term ``kinds'' which all scientists have said is not a
word of science and has no fixed meaning.  Additionally, the Act presents
both evolution and creation science as ``package deals.''  Thus, evidence
critical to some aspect of what the creationists define as evolution is
taken as support for a theory which includes a worldwide flood and a
relatively young earth <A HREF="#24">(24)</a>.<p>



<CENTER><H2>IV(C)</H2></CENTER>

	In addition to the fallacious pedagogy of the two model approach,
Section 4(a) lacks legitimate educational value because
``creation-science'' as defined in that section is simply not science.
Several witnesses suggested definitions of science.  A descriptive
definition was said to be that science is what is ``accepted by the
scientific community'' and is ``what scientists do.''  The obvious
implication of this description is that, in a free society, knowledge does
not require the imprimatur of legislation in order to become science.<p>


	More precisely, the essential characteristics of science are:<BR>
(1) It is guided by natural law;<BR>
(2) It has to be explanatory by reference to nature law;<BR>
(3) It is testable against the empirical world;	<BR>
(4) Its conclusions are tentative, i.e. are not necessarily the
            final word; and <BR>
(5) Its is falsifiable. (Ruse and other science witnesses).<p>

	Creation science as described in Section 4(a) fails to meet these
essential characteristics.  First, the section revolves around 4(a)(1)
which asserts a sudden creation ``from nothing.''  Such a concept is not
science because it depends upon a supernatural intervention which is not
guided by natural law.  It is not explanatory by reference to natural law,
is not testable and is not falsifiable <A HREF="#25">(25)</a>.<p>


	If the unifying idea of supernatural creation by God is removed
from Section 4, the remaining parts of the section explain nothing and are
meaningless assertions.<p>


	Section 4(a)(2), relating to the ``insufficiency of mutation and
natural selection in bringing about development of all living kinds from a
single organism,'' is an incomplete negative generalization directed at the
theory of evolution.<p>


	Section 4(a)(3) which describes ``changes only within fixed limits
of originally created kinds of plants and animals'' fails to conform to the
essential characteristics of science for several reasons.  First, there is
no scientific definition of ``kinds'' and none of the witnesses was able to
point to any scientific authority which recognized the term or knew how many
``kinds'' existed.  One defense witness suggested there may may be 100 to
10,000 different ``kinds.'' Another believes there were ``about 10,000,
give or take a few thousand.'' Second, the assertion appears to be an
effort to establish outer limits of changes within species.  There is no
scientific explanation for these limits which is guided by natural law and
the limitations, whatever they are, cannot be explained by natural law.<p>


	The statement in 4(a)(4) of ``separate ancestry of man and apes''
is a bald assertion.  It explains nothing and refers to no scientific fact
or theory <A HREF="#26">(26)</a>.<p>


	Section 4(a)(5) refers to ``explanation of the earth's geology by
catastrophism, including the occurrence of a worldwide flood.''  This
assertion completely fails as science.  The Act is referring to the
Noachian flood described in the Book of Genesis <A HREF="#27">(27)</a>.
The creationist writers concede that <i>any</i> kind of Genesis Flood
depends upon supernatural intervention.  A worldwide flood as an
explanation of the world's geology is not the product of natural law, nor
can its occurrence be explained by natural law.<p>


	Section 4(a)(6) equally fails to meet the standards of science.
``Relatively recent inception'' has no scientific meaning.  It can only be
given in reference to creationist writings which place the age at between
6,000 and 20,000 years because of the genealogy of the Old Testament.  See,
e.g., Px 78, Gish (6,000 to 10,000); Px 87, Segraves(6,000 to 20,000).
Such a reasoning process is not the product of natural law;  not
explainable by natural law;  nor is it tentative.<p>


	Creation science as defined in Section 4(a), not only fails to
follow the canons of dealing with scientific theory, it also fails to fit
the more general descriptions of ``what scientists think'' and ``what
scientists do.''  The scientific community consists of individuals and
groups, nationally and internationally, who work independently in such
varied fields as biology, paleontology, geology, and astronomy.  Their work
is published and subject to review and testing by their peers.  The journals
for publication are both numerous and varied.  There is, however, not one
recognized scientific journal which has published an article espousing the
creation science theory described in Section 4(a).  Some of the State's
witnesses suggested that the scientific community was ``close-minded'' on
the subject of creationism and that explained the lack of acceptance of the
creation science arguments.  Yet no witness produced a scientific article
for which publication has been refused.  Perhaps some members of the
scientific community are resistant to new ideas.  It is, however,
inconceivable that such a loose knit group of independent thinkers in all
the varied fields of science could, or would, so effectively censor new
scientific thought.<p>


	The creationists have difficulty maintaining among their ranks
consistency in the claim that creationism is science.  The author of Act
590, Ellwanger, said that neither evolution or creationism was science.  He
thinks that both are religious.  Duane Gish recently responded to an
article in <i>Discover</I> critical of creationism by stating:

<blockquote>
Stephen Jay Gould states that creationists claim creation is a scientific
theory.  This is a false accusation.  Creationists have repeatedly stated
that neither creation nor evolution is a scientific theory (and each is
equally religious).  (Gish, letter to editor of <i>Discover</I>, July,
1981, App. 30 to Plaintiffs' Pretrial Brief)
</blockquote>

	The methodology employed by creationists is another factor which is
indicative that their work is not science.  A scientific theory must be
tentative and always subject to revision or abandonment in light of facts
that are inconsistent with, or falsify, the theory.  A theory that is by
its own terms dogmatic, absolutist, and never subject to revision is not a
scientific theory.<p>


	The creationists' methods do not take data, weigh it against the
opposing scientific data, and thereafter reach the conclusions stated in
Section 4(a).  Instead, they take the literal wording of the Book of
Genesis and attempt to find scientific support for it.  The method is best
explained in the language of Morris in his book (Px 31) <i>Studies in The
Bible and Science</I> at page 114:

<blockquote> ... it is ... quite impossible to determine anything about
Creation through a study of present processes, because present processes
are not creative in character.  If man wished to know anything about
Creation (the time of Creation, the duration of Creation, the order of
Creation, the methods of Creation, or anything else) his sole source of
true information is that of divine revelation.  God was there when it
happened.  We were not there ... Therefore, we are completely limited to
what God has seen fit to tell us, and this information is in His written
Word. This is our textbook on the science of Creation!  </blockquote>

The Creation Research Society employs the same unscientific approach to the
issue of creationism.  Its applicants for membership must subscribe to the
belief that the Book of Genesis is ``historically and scientifically true
in all of the original autographs'' <A HREF="#28">(28)</a>.  The Court
would never criticize or discredit any person's testimony based on his or
her religious beliefs.  While anybody is free to approach a scientific
inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the
methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to
change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the
investigation.<p>


<CENTER><H2>IV(D)</H2></CENTER>

	In efforts to establish ``evidence'' in support of creation
science, the defendants relied upon the same false premise as the two model
approach contained in Section 4, i.e., all evidence which criticized
evolutionary theory was proof in support of creation science.  For example,
the defendants established that the mathematical probability of a chance
chemical combination resulting in life from non-life is as remote that such
an occurrence is almost beyond imagination.  Those mathematical facts, the
defendants argue, are scientific evidences that life was the product of a
creator.  While the statistical figures may be impressive evidence against
the theory of chance chemical combinations as an explanation of origins, it
requires a leap of faith to interpret those figures so as to support a
complex doctrine which includes a sudden creation from nothing, a worldwide
flood, separate ancestry of man and apes, and a young earth.<p>


	The defendants' argument would be more persuasive if, in fact,
there were only two theories or idea about the origins of life and the
world.  That there are a number of theories was acknowledge by the State's
witnesses, Dr. Wickramasinghe and Dr. Geisler.  Dr. Wickramasinghe
testified at length in support of a theory that life on earth was
``seeded'' by comets which delivered genetic material and perhaps organisms
to the earth's surface from interstellar dust far outside the solar system.
The ``seeding'' theory further hypothesizes that the earth remains under
the continuing influence of genetic material from space which continues to
affect life.  While Wickramasinghe's theory <A HREF="#29">(29)</a> about
the origins of life on earth has not received general acceptance within the
scientific community, he has, at least, used scientific methodology to
produce a theory of origins which meets the essential characteristics of
science.  <p>


	The Court is at a loss to understand why Dr. Wickramasinghe was
called in behalf of the defendants.  Perhaps it was because he was
generally critical of the theory of evolution and the scientific community, a
tactic consistent with the strategy of the defense.  Unfortunately for the
defense, he demonstrated that the simplistic approach of the two model
analysis of the origins of life is false.  Furthermore, he corroborated the
plaintiffs' witnesses by concluding that ``no rational scientist'' would
believe the earth's geology could be explained by reference to a worldwide
flood or that the earth was less than one million years old.<p>


	The proof in support of creation science consisted almost entirely
of efforts to discredit the theory of evolution through a rehash of data and
theories which have been before the scientific community for decades.  The
arguments asserted by the creationists are not based upon new scientific
evidence or laboratory data which has been ignored by the scientific
community.  <p>


	Robert Gentry's discovery of radioactive polonium haloes in granite
and coalified woods is, perhaps, the most recent scientific work which the
creationists use as argument for a "relatively recent inception" of the
earth and a "worldwide flood."  The existence of polonium haloes in granite
and coalified wood is thought to be inconsistent with radiometric dating
methods based upon constant radioactive decay rates.  Mr. Gentry's findings
were published almost ten years ago and have been the subject of some
discussion in the scientific community.  The discoveries have not, however,
led to the formulation of any scientific hypothesis or theory which would
explain a relatively recent inception of the earth or a worldwide flood.
Gentry's discovery has been treated as a minor mystery which will
eventually be explained.  It may deserve further investigation, but the
National Science Foundation has not deemed it to be of sufficient import to
support further funding.<p>


	The testimony of Marianne Wilson was persuasive evidence that
creation science is not science.  Ms. Wilson is in charge of the science
curriculum for Pulaski County Special School District, the largest school
district in the State of Arkansas.  Prior to the passage of Act 590, Larry
Fisher, a science teacher in the District, using materials from the ICR<
convinced the School Board that it should voluntarily adopt creation
science as part of its science curriculum.  The District Superintendent
assigned Ms. Wilson the job of producing a creation science curriculum
guide.  Ms. Wilson's testimony about the project was particularly
convincing because she obviously approached the assignment with an open
mind and no preconceived notions about the subject.  She had not heard of
creation science until about a year ago and did not know its meaning before
she began her research.  <p>


	Ms. Wilson worked with a committee of science teachers appointed
from the District.  They reviewed practically all of the creationist
literature.  Ms. Wilson and the committee members reached the unanimous
conclusion that creationism is not science;  it is religion.  They so
reported to the Board.  The Board ignored the recommendation and insisted
that a curriculum guide be prepared. <p>


	In researching the subject, Ms. Wilson sought the assistance of
Mr. Fisher who initiated the Board action and asked professors in the
science departments of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and the
University of Central Arkansas <A HREF="#30">(30)</a> for reference
material and assistance, and attended a workshop conducted at Central
Baptist College by Dr. Richard Bliss of the ICR staff.  Act 590 became law
during the course of her work so she used Section 4(a) as a format for her
curriculum guide.<p>


	Ms. Wilson found all available creationists' materials unacceptable
because they were permeated with religious references and reliance upon
religious beliefs.<p>


	It is easy to understand why Ms. Wilson and other educators find
the creationists's textbook material and teaching guides unacceptable.  The
materials misstate the theory of evolution in the same fashion as Section
4(b) of the Act, with emphasis on the alternative mutually exclusive nature
of creationism and evolution.  Students are constantly encouraged to
compare and make a choice between the two models, and the material is not
presented in an accurate manner.<p>

	A typical example is <i>Origins</i> (Px 76) by Richard B. Bliss,
Directory of Curriculum Development of the ICR.  The presentation begins
with a chart describing "preconceived idea about origins" which suggests
that some people believe that evolution is atheistic.  Concepts of
evolution, such as "adaptative radiation" are erroneously presented.  At
page 11, figure 1.6 of the text, a chart purports to illustrate this "very
important" part of the evolution model.  The chart conveys the idea that
such diverse mammals as a whale, bear, bat and monkey all evolved from a
shrew through the process of adaptive radiation.  Such a suggestion is, of
course, a totally erroneous and misleading application of the theory.  Even
more objectionable, especially when viewed in light of the emphasis on
asking the student to elect one of the models, is the chart presentation at
page 17, figure 1.6.  That chart purports to illustrate the evolutionists'
belief that man evolved from bacteria to fish to reptile to mammals and,
thereafter, into man.  The illustration indicates, however, that the mammal
which evolved was <i>a rat</i>.<p>


	<i>Biology, A Search For Order in Complexity</I> <A
HREF="#31">(31)</a> is a high school biology text typical of creationists'
materials.  The following quotations are illustrative:

<blockquote>
Flowers and roots do not have a mind to have purpose of their own:
	therefore, this planning must have been done for them by the
	Creator. (at page 12)<p>

The exquisite beauty of color and shape in flowers exceeds the skill of poet,
	artist, and king.  Jesus said (from Matthew's gospel), ``Consider the
	lilies in the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do  they
	spin ...'' (Px 129 at page 363)
</blockquote>

	The ``public school edition'' texts written by creationists simply
omit Biblical references but the content and message remain the same.  For
example, <i>Evolution -- The Fossils Say No!</I> <A HREF="#32">(32)</a>
contains the following:

<blockquote>
Creation.  By creation we mean the bringing into being by a supernatural
	Creator of the basic kinds of plants and animals by the process of
	sudden, or fiat, creation.<p>


We do not know how the Creator created, what processes He used, <i> for he
	used processes which are not now operating anywhere in the natural
	universe</i>.  This is why we refer to creation as Special Creation.
	We cannot discover by scientific investigation anything about the
	creative processes used by the Creator. (page 40)
</blockquote>

	Gish's book also portrays the large majority of evolutionists as
``materialistic atheists or agnostics.''<p>


	<i>Scientific Creationism</I> (Public School Edition) by Morris, is
another text reviewed by Ms. Wilson's committee and rejected as unacceptable.
The following quotes illustrate the purpose and theme of the text:

<blockquote>
<CENTER>Forward </CENTER><p>

Parents and youth leaders today, and even many scientists and educators, have
	become concerned about the prevalence and influence of evolutionary
	philosophy in modern curriculum.  Not only is the system inimical to
	orthodox Christianity and Judaism, but also, as many are convinced, to
	a healthy society and true science as well.  (at page iii)<p>


The rationalist of course finds the concept of special creation insufferably
	naive, even ``incredible''.  Such a judgment, however, is warranted
	only if one categorically dismisses the existence of an omnipotent
	God. (at page 17)
</blockquote>

	Without using creationist literature, Ms. Wilson was unable to
locate one genuinely scientific article or work which supported Section
4(a).  In order to comply with the mandate of the Board she used such
materials as an article from <i>Readers Digest</I> about ``atomic clocks''
which inferentially suggested that the earth was less than 4 1/2 billion
years old.  She was unable to locate any substantive teaching material for
some parts of Section 4 such as the worldwide flood.  The curriculum guide
which she prepared cannot be taught and has no education value as science.
The defendants did not produce any text or writing in response to this
evidence which they claimed was usable in the public school classroom <A
HREF="#33">(33)</a>.<p>


	The conclusion that creation science has no scientific merit or
educational value as science has legal significance in light of the Court's
previous conclusion that creation science has, as one major effect, the
advancement of religion.  The second part of the three-pronged test for
establishment reaches only those statutes as having their <i>primary</i>
effect the advancement of religion.  Secondary effects which advance
religion are not constitutionally fatal.  Since creation science is not
science, the conclusion is inescapable that the <i>only</i> real effect of
Act 590 is the advancement of religion.  The Act therefore fails both the
first and second portions of the test in <i>Lemon v. Kurtzman</I>, 403
U.S. 602 (1971).<p>

<CENTER><H2>IV(E)</H2></CENTER>

	Act 590 mandates ``balanced treatment'' for creation science and
evolution science.  The Act prohibits instruction in any religious doctrine
or references to religious writings.  The Act is self-contradictory and
compliance is impossible unless the public schools elect to forego
significant potions of subjects such as biology, world history, geology,
zoology, botany, psychology, anthropology, sociology, philosophy, physics
and chemistry.  Presently, the concepts of evolutionary theory as described
in 4(b) permeate the public textbooks.  There is no way teachers can teach
the Genesis account of creation in a secular manner.<p>


	The State Department of Education, through its textbook selection
committee, school boards and school administrators will be required to
constantly monitor materials to avoid using religious references.  The
school boards, administrators and teachers face an impossible task.  How is
the teacher to respond to questions about a creation suddenly and out of
nothing?  How will a teacher explain the occurrence of a worldwide flood?
How will a teacher explain the concept of a relatively recent age of the
earth?  The answer is obvious because the only source of this information
is ultimately contained in the Book of Genesis.<p>


	References to the pervasive nature of religious concepts in
creation science texts amply demonstrate why State entanglement with
religion is inevitable under Act 590.  Involvement of the State in
screening texts for impermissible religious references will require State
officials to make delicate religious judgments.  The need to monitor
classroom discussion in order to uphold the Act's prohibition against
religious instruction will necessarily involve administrators in questions
concerning religion.  These continuing involvements of State officials in
questions and issues of religion create an excessive and prohibited
entanglement with religion.  <i> Brandon v. Board of Education</i>, 487
F.Supp 1219, 1230 (N.D.N.Y.), <i>aff'd.</i>, 635 F.2d 971 (2nd Cir. 1980).<p>



<CENTER><H2>V</H2></CENTER>


These conclusions are dispositive of the case and there is no need to reach
legal conclusions with respect to the remaining issues.  The plaintiffs
raised two other issues questioning the constitutionality of the Act and,
insofar as the factual findings relevant to these issues are not covered in
the preceding discussion, the Court will address these issues.
Additionally, the defendants raise two other issues which warrant
discussion.<p>



<CENTER><H2>V(A)</H2></CENTER>


	First, plaintiff teachers argue the Act is unconstitutionally vague
to the extent that they cannot comply with its mandate of ``balanced''
treatment without jeopardizing their employment.  The argument centers
around the lack of a precise definition in the Act for the word
``balanced.''  Several witnesses expressed opinions that the word has such
meanings as equal time, equal weight, or equal legitimacy.  Although the
Act could have been more explicit, ``balanced'' is a word subject to
ordinary understanding.  The proof is not convincing that a teacher using a
reasonably acceptable understanding of the word and making a good faith
effort to comply with the Act will be in jeopardy of termination.  Other
portions of the Act are arguably vague, such as the ``relatively recent''
inception of the earth and life.  The evidence establishes, however, that
relatively recent means from 6,000 to 20,000 years, as commonly understood
in creation science literature.  The meaning of this phrase, like Section
4(a) generally, is, for purposes of the Establishment Clause, all too
clear.<p>


<CENTER><H2>V(B)</H2></CENTER>


	The plaintiffs' other argument revolves around the alleged
infringement by the defendants upon the academic freedom of teachers and
students.  It is contended this unprecedented intrusion in the curriculum
by the State prohibits teachers from teaching what they believe should be
taught or requires them to teach that which they do not believe is proper.
The evidence reflects that traditionally the State Department of Education,
local school boards and administration officials exercise little, if any,
influence upon the subject matter taught by classroom teachers.  Teachers
have been given freedom to teach and emphasize those portions of subjects
the individual teacher considered important. The limits to this discretion
have generally been derived from the approval of textbooks by the State
Department and preparation of curriculum guides by the school districts.<p>


	Several witnesses testified that academic freedom for the teacher
means, in substance, that the individual teacher should be permitted
unlimited discretion subject only to the bounds of professional ethics.
The Court is not prepare to adopt such a broad view of academic freedom in
the public schools.<p>


	In any event, if Act 590 is implemented, many teachers will be
required to teach materials in support of creation science which they do
not consider academically sound.  Many teachers will simply forego teaching
subjects which might trigger the ``balanced treatment'' aspects of Act 590
even though they think the subjects are important to a proper presentation
of a course.<p>


	Implementation of Act 580 will have serious and untoward
consequences for students, particularly those planning to attend college.
Evolution is the cornerstone of modern biology, and many courses in public
schools contain subject matter relating to such varied topics as the age of
the earth, geology and relationships among living things.  Any student who
is deprived of instruction as to the prevailing scientific thought on these
topics will be denied a significant part of science education.  Such a
deprivation through the high school level would undoubtedly have an impact
upon the quality of education in the State's colleges and universities,
especially including the pre-professional and professional programs in the
health sciences.<p>



<CENTER><H2>V(C)</H2></CENTER>


	The defendants argue in their brief that evolution is, in effect, a
religion, and that by teaching a religion which is contrary to some
students' religious views, the State is infringing upon the student's free
exercise rights under the First Amendment.  Mr. Ellwanger's legislative
findings, which were adopted as a finding of fact by the Arkansas
Legislature in Act 590, provides:

<blockquote> Evolution-science is contrary to the religious convictions or
moral values or philosophical beliefs of many students and parents,
including individuals of many different religious faiths and with diverse
moral and philosophical beliefs.  Act 590, &7(d).  </blockquote>

	The defendants argue that the teaching of evolution alone presents
both a free exercise problem and an establishment problem which can only be
redressed by giving balanced treatment to creation science, which is
admittedly consistent with some religious beliefs.  This argument appears
to have its genesis in a student note written by Mr. Wendell Bird, ``Freedom
of Religion and Science Instruction in Public Schools,'' 87 Yale L.J. 515
(1978). The argument has no legal merit.<p>


	If creation science is, in fact, science and not religion, as the
defendants claim, it is difficult to see how the teaching of such a science
could ``neutralize'' the religious nature of evolution.<p>


	Assuming for the purposes of argument, however, that evolution is a
religion or religious tenet, the remedy is to stop the teaching of
evolution, not establish another religion in opposition to it.  Yet it is
clearly established in the case law, and perhaps also in common sense, that
evolution is not a religion and that teaching evolution does not violate
the Establishment Clause, <i>Epperson v. Arkansas, supra</i>, <i>Willoughby
v. Stever</i>, No. 15574-75 (D.D.C. May 18, 1973); <i>aff'd.</i> 504 F.2d
271 (D.C. Cir. 1974), <i>cert. denied </i>, 420 U.S. 924 (1975); <i>Wright
v. Houston Indep. School Dist.</I>, 366 F. Supp. 1208 (S.D. Tex 1978), <i>
aff.d.</i> 486 F.2d 137 (5th Cir. 1973), <i>cert. denied</I> 417 U.S. 969
(1974).<p>



<CENTER><H2>V(D)</H2></CENTER>


	The defendants presented Dr. Larry Parker, a specialist in devising
curricula for public schools.  He testified that the public school's
curriculum should reflect the subjects the public wants in schools.  The
witness said that polls indicated a significant majority of the American
public thought creation science should be taught if evolution was taught.
The point of this testimony was never placed in a legal context.  No doubt
a sizeable majority of Americans believe in the concept of a Creator or, at
least, are not opposed to the concept and see nothing wrong with teaching
school children the idea.<p>


	The application and content of First Amendment principles are not
determined by public opinion polls or by a majority vote.  Whether the
proponents of Act 590 constitute the majority or the minority is quite
irrelevant under a constitutional system of government.  No group, no matter
how large or small, may use the organs of government, of which the public
schools are the most conspicuous and influential, to foist its religious
beliefs on others.<p>


	The Court closes this opinion with a thought expressed eloquently by
the great Justice Frankfurter:

<blockquote> We renew our conviction that ``we have stake the very
existence of our country on the faith that complete separation between the
state and religion is best for the state and best for religion.''
<I>Everson v. Board of Education</I>, 330 U.S. at 59.  If nowhere else, in
the relation between Church and State, ``good fences make good neighbors.''
[<i>McCollum v. Board of Education</I>, 333 U.S. 203, 232 (1948)]
</blockquote>

An injunction will be entered permanently prohibiting enforcement of Act
590.<p>

	It is ordered this January 5, 1982.<p>

<A NAME="1"></A>

1.  The complaint is based on 42 U.S.C. &1983, which provides a remedy
against any person who, acting under color of state law, deprives another
of any right, privilege or immunity guaranteed by the United States
Constitution or federal law.  This Court's jurisdiction arises under 28
U.S.C. &&1331, 1343(3) and 1343(4).  The power to issue declaratory
judgments is expressed in 28 U.S.C. &&2201 and 2202.<p>

<A NAME="2"></A>

2.  The facts necessary to establish the plaintiff's standing to sue are
contained in the joint stipulation of facts, which is hereby adopted and
incorporated herein by reference.  There is no doubt that the case is ripe
for adjudication.<p>

<A NAME="3"></A>

3.  The State of Arkansas was dismissed as a defendant because of its
immunity from suit under the Eleventh Amendment.  <i>Hans v. Louisiana</I>,
134 U.S. 1 (1890).<p>

<A NAME="4"></A>

4.  The authorities differ as to generalizations which may be made about
Fundamentalism.  For example, Dr. Geisler testified to the widely held view
that there are five beliefs characteristic of all Fundamentalist movements, in
addition, of course, to the inerrancy of Scripture:  (1) belief in the virgin
birth of Christ, (2) belief in the deity of Christ, (3) belief in the
substitutional atonement of Christ, (4) belief in the second coming of Christ,
and (5) belief in the physical resurrection of all departed souls.
Dr. Marsden, however, testified that this generalization, which has been
common in religious scholarship, is now thought to be historical error.  There
is no doubt, however, that all Fundamentalists take the Scriptures as inerrent
and probably most take them as literally true.<p>
<A NAME="5"></A>

5.  Initiated Act 1 of 1929, Ark. Stat. Ann. &80-1627 <i>et seq.</i>, which
prohibited the teaching of evolution in Arkansas schools, is discussed
<i>infra</i> at text accompanying note 26.<p>
<A NAME="6"></A>

6.  Subsequent references to the testimony will be made by the last name of
the witness only.  References to documentary exhibits will be by the name
of the author and the exhibit number.<p>
<A NAME="7"></A>

7.  Applicants for membership in the CRS must subscribe to the following
statement of belief: ``(1) The Bible is the written Word of God, and
because we believe it to be inspired thruout [sic], all of its assertions
are historically and scientifically true in all of the original autographs.
To the student of nature, this means that the account of origins in Genesis
is a factual presentation of simple historical truths.  (2) All basic types
of living things, including man, were made by direct creative acts of God
during Creation Week as described in Genesis.  Whatever biological changes
have occurred since Creation have accomplished only changes within the
original created kinds.  (3) The great Flood described in Genesis, commonly
referred to as the Noachian Deluge, was an historical event, worldwide in
its extent and effect.  (4) Finally, we are an organization of Christian
men of science, who accept Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior.  The
account of the special creation of Adam and Eve as one man and one woman,
and their subsequent Fall into sin, is the basis for our belief in the
necessity of a Savior for all mankind.  Therefore, salvation can come only
thru [sic] accepting Jesus Christ as our Savior.'' (Px 115)<p>

<A NAME="8"></A>


8.  Because of the voluminous nature of the documentary exhibits, the
parties were directed by pre-trial order to submit their proposed exhibits
for the Court's convenience prior to trial.  The numbers assigned to the
pre-trial submissions do not correspond with those assigned to the same
documents at trial and, in some instances, the pre-trial submissions are
more complete.<p>

<A NAME="9"></A>

9.  Px 130, Morris, <i>Introducing Scientific Creationism Into the Public
Schools</I> (1975), and Bird, ``Resolution for Balanced Presentation of
Evolution and Scientific Creationism.'' <i>ICR Impact Series</I> No. 71,
App. 14 to Plaintiff's Pretrial Brief.<p>

<A NAME="10"></A>

10.  The creationists often show candor in their proselytization.  Henry
Morris has stated, ``Even if a favorable statute or court decision is
obtained, it will probably be declared unconstitutional, especially if the
legislation or injunction refers to the Bible account of creation.''  In
the same vein he notes, ``The only effective way to get creationism taught
properly is to have it taught by teachers who are both willing and able to
do it.  Since most teachers now are neither willing nor able, they must
first be both persuaded and instructed themselves.'' Px 130, Morris,
<i>Introducing Scientific Creationism Into the Public Schools</I>
(1975)(unpaged).<p>

<A NAME="11"></A>

11. Mr. Bird sought to participate in this litigation by representing a
number of individuals who wanted to intervene as defendants.  The
application for intervention was denied by this Court.  <i>McLean
v. Arkansas</I>, ____ F.Supp. ______, (E.D. Ark. 1981), aff'd. <i>per
curiam</I>, Slip Op. No. 81-2023 (8th Cir. Oct. 16, 1981).<p>

<A NAME="12"></A>

12.  The model act had been revised to insert ``creation science'' in lieu
of creationism because Ellwanger had the impression people thought that
creationism was too religious a term.  (Ellwanger Depo. at 79)<p>

<A NAME="13"></A>

13.  The original model act had been introduced in the South Carolina
Legislature, but had dies without action after the South Carolina Attorney
General had opined that the act was unconstitutional.<p>

<A NAME="14"></A>

14.  Specifically, Senator Holsted testified that he holds to a literal
interpretation of the Bible; that the bill was compatible with his
religious beliefs; that the bill does favor the position of literalists;
that his religious convictions were a factor in his sponsorship of the
bill; and that he stated publicly to the <i>Arkansas Gazette</I> (although
not on the floor of the Senate) contemporaneously wit h the legislative
debate that the bill does presuppose the existence of a divine creator.
There is no doubt that Senator Holsted knew he was sponsoring the teaching
of a religious doctrine.  His view was that the bill did not violate the
First Amendment because, as he saw it, it did not favor one denomination
over another.<p>

<A NAME="15"></A>

15.  This statute is, of course, clearly unconstitutional under the Supreme
Court's decision in <i>Abbington School District v. Schempp</I>, 374
U.S. 203 (1963)<p>

<A NAME="16"></A>

16.  The joint stipulation of facts establishes that the following areas are
the only <i>information</i> specifically required by statute to be taught in
all Arkansas schools:  (1) the effects of alcohol and narcotics on the human
body, (2) conservation of national resources, (3) Bird Week, (4) Fire
Prevention, and (5) Flag etiquette.  Additionally, certain specific courses,
such as American history  and Arkansas history, must be completed by each
student before graduation from high school.<p>

<A NAME="17"></A>

17.  Paul Ellwanger stated in his deposition that he did not know why
Section 4(a)(2) (insufficiency of mutation and natural selection) was
included as an evidence supporting creation science.  He indicated that he
was not a scientist, ``but these are postulates that have been laid down by
creation scientists.''  Ellwanger Depo. at 136.<p>

<A NAME="18"></A>

18.  Although defendants must make some effort to cast the concept of
creation in non-religious terms, this effort surely causes discomfort to
some of the Act's more theologically sophisticated supporters.  The concept
of a creator God distinct from the God of love and mercy is closely similar
to the Marcion and Gnostic heresies, among the deadliest to threaten the
early Christian church.  These heresies had much to do with development and
adoption of the Apostle's Creed as the official creedal statement of the
Roman Catholic Church in the West. (Gilkey.)<p>

<A NAME="19"></A>

19.  The parallels between Section 4(a) and Genesis are quite specific: (1)
``sudden creation from nothing'' is taken from Genesis, 1:1-10 (Vawter,
Gilkey); (2) destruction of the world by a flood of divine origin is a
notion peculiar to Judeo-Christian tradition and is based on Chapters 7 and
8 of Genesis (Vawter); (3) the term ``kinds'' has no fixed scientific
meaning, but appears repeatedly in Genesis (all scientific witnesses); (4)
``relatively recent inception'' means an age of the earth from 6,000 to
10,000 years and is based on the genealogy of the Old Testament using the
the rather astronomical ages assigned to the patriarchs (Gilkey and several
of the defendants' scientific witnesses); (5) separate ancestry of man and
ape focuses on the portion of the theory of evolution which Fundamentalists
find most offensive, <i>Epperson v. Arkansas</i>, 393 U.S. 97 (1968)<p>

<A NAME="20"></A>

20.  ``[C]oncepts concerning ... a supreme being of some sort are
manifestly religious ... These concepts do not shed that religiosity merely
because they are presented as philosophy or as a science ...'' <i>Malnak
v. Yogi</i>, 440 F. Supp. 1284, 1322 (D.N.J. 1977); <i>aff'd per
curiam</I>, 592 F.2d 197 (3d Cir. 1979).<p>

<A NAME="21"></A>

21.  See, e.g., Px 76, Morris, <i>et. al., Scientific Creationism</i>, 203
(1980) (``If creation really is a fact, this means there is a
<i>Creator</I>, and the universe is his creation.'')  Numerous other
examples of such admissions can be found in the many exhibits which
represent creationist literature, but no useful purpose would be served
here by a potentially endless listing.<p>

<A NAME="22"></A>

22.  Morris, the Director of ICR and one who first advocated the two model
approach, insists that a true Christian cannot compromises with the theory
of evolution and that the Genesis version of creation and the theory of
evolution are mutually exclusive.  Px 31, Morris, <i> Studies in the Bible
& Science</I>, 102-103.  The two model approach was the subject of
Dr. Richard Bliss's doctoral dissertation. (Dx 35).  It is presented in
Bliss, <i> Origins: Two Models - Evolution, Creation</i> (1978).  Moreover,
the two model approach merely casts in educationalist language the dualism
which appears in all creationist literature -- creation (i.e. God) and
evolution are presented as two alternative and mutually exclusive
theories. See, e.g., Px 75, Morris, <i>Scientific Creationism</I> (1974)
(public school edition); Px 59, Fox, <i>Fossils: Hard Facts from the
Earth</I>.  Particularly illustrative is Px 61, Boardman, <i>et. al.,
Worlds Without End</i> (1971) a CSRC publication: One group of scientists,
known as creationists, believe that God, in a miraculous manner, created
all matter and energy ...<p>

``Scientists who insist that the universe just grew, by accident, from a
mass of hot gases without the direction or help of a Creator are known as
evolutionists.''<p>

<A name="23"></a>

23.  The idea that belief in a creator and acceptance of the scientific
theory of evolution are mutually exclusive is a false premise and offensive
to the religious views of many. (Hicks) Dr. Francisco Ayala, a geneticist
of considerable reknown and a former Catholic priest who has the equivalent
of a Ph.D. in theology, pointed out that many working scientists who
subscribe to the theory of evolution are devoutly religious.<p>

<A name="24"></a>

24.  This is so despite the fact that some of the defense witnesses do not
subscribe to the young earth or flood hypotheses.  Dr. Geisler stated his
belief that the earth is several billion years old.  Dr. Wickramasinghe
stated that no rational scientist would believe the earth is less than one
million years old or that all the world's geology could be explained by a
worldwide flood.<p>

<A name="25"></a>

25. ``We do not know how the Creator created, what processes He used, <i>
for he used processes which are not now operating anywhere in the natural
universe</i>.  This is why we refer to creation as Special Creation.  We
cannot discover by scientific investigation anything about the creative
processes used by God.'' Px 78, Gish, <i>Evolution -- The Fossils Say
No!</I> (42) (3d ed. 1979) (emphasis in original).<p>

<A name="26"></a>

26.  The evolutionary notion that man and some modern apes have a common
ancestor somewhere is the distant past has consistently been distorted by
anti-evolutionists to say that man descended from modern monkeys.  As such,
this idea has long been more offensive to Fundamentalists.  See,
<i>Epperson v. Arkansas</i>, 393 U.S. 97 (1968)<p>

<A name="27"></a>

27.  Not only was this point acknowledged by virtually all the defense
witnesses, it is patent in the creationist literature.  See, e.g., Px 89,
Kofahl & Segraves, <i>The Creation Explanation</I>, 40: ``The Flood of Noah
brought about vast changes in the earth's surface, including vulcanism,
mountain building, and the deposition of the major part of sedimentary
strata.  This principle is called 'Biblical catastrophism.'''<p>

<A name="28"></a>

28.  See n. 7, <i>supra</i>, for the full test of the CRS creed.<p>

<A name="29"></a>

29.  The theory is detailed in Wickramasinghe's book with Sir Fred Hoyle,
<i>Evolution from Space</I> (1981), which is Dx 79.<p>

<A name="30"></a>

30.  Ms. Wilson stated that some professors she spoke with sympathized with
her plight and tried to help her find scientific materials to support
Section 4(a).  Others simply asked her to leave.<p>

<A name="31"></a>

31.  Px 129, published by Zonderman Publishing House (1974), states that it
was ``prepared by the Textbook Committee of the Creation Research
Society.''  It has a disclaimer pasted inside the front cover stating that
it is not suitable for use in public schools.<p>

<A name="32"></a>

32.  Px 77, by Duane Gish<p>

<A name="33"></a>

33.  The passage of Act 590 apparently caught a number of its supporters
off guard as much as it did the school district.  The Act's author, Paul
Ellwanger, stated in a letter to ``Dick,'' (apparently Dr. Richard Bliss at
ICR): ``And finally, if you know of any textbooks at any level and for any
subjects that you think are acceptable to you and are also constitutionally
admissible, these are things that would be of <i>enormous</I> to these
bewildered folks who may be cause, as Arkansas now has been, by the sudden
need to implement a whole new ball game with which they are quite
unfamiliar.'' [sic] (Unnumbered attachment to Ellwanger depo.)<p>
