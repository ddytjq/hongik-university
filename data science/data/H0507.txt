                <i>Fundamental research in microbiology to elucidate the mechanisms of biotransformation and
biodegradation of complex contaminant mixtures.</i><p>
<h3>PROGRAM OBJECTIVE</H3>

<HR>
                To understand the mechanisms and pathways for biotransformation and
                biodegradation of contaminant mixtures in order to improve the performance of
                bioremediation in the field. <p>
                <h3>BACKGROUND</H3>
                
                
<HR>
<hr><h4><i>The current understanding of biotransformation and biodegradation
                pathways and mechanisms in the field is incomplete.</i></h4><hr>
                
                The goal of all bioremediation efforts is to reduce the potential toxicity of chemical
                contaminants in the field by using microorganisms, plants, and animals to transform,
                degrade, or immobilize toxicants.  There is already a significant base of knowledge
                about many pathways for organic degradation, and several important contaminant
                degradation mechanisms are presently under detailed investigation.  Fundamental
                knowledge of biodegradation and biotransformation mechanisms has already
                contributed significantly to improving the performance of bioremediation in the
                field.  Bioremediation strategies employing co-metabolism, anaerobic
                biotransformations of highly chlorinated solvents, and alternate electron acceptors
                which are in use today resulted in large part from fundamental investigations of the
                mechanisms used by microorganisms to transform contaminants. <p> 
                Despite the successful contributions of existing knowledge about biodegradation and
                biotransformation mechanisms, there is still much that research can contribute.  At
                present, the understanding of biotransformation and biodegradation pathways and
                mechanisms in the field is incomplete. Although the degradation of many organics
                and the biotransformation of some inorganic compounds in laboratory cultures have
                been well described, it is unclear how this information relates to bioremediation
                processes under field conditions.  In addition, research is needed to understand
                recently discovered biotransformation processes such as metal biotransformations
                and biosequestration, coupled aerobic and anaerobic processes, co-metabolism,
                biotransformations in the presence of alternative electron donors/acceptors, and
                biotransformations catalyzed by consortia (Ehrlich, 1990; Francis, 1990; Lovley,
                1993; Macaskie, 1991).<p>
                In both the short and long term, a sound understanding of the fundamental
                mechanisms of biotransformation and detoxification will lead to improved
                prediction, control, and assessment of bioremediation performance, facilitate the
                selection and prioritization of contaminated sites for bioremediation, and result in
                the transfer of improved bioremediation processes for cleanup of contaminated
                sites.<p>
                <h3>APPROACH</H3>
                
                
<HR>
<hr><h4><i>An important challenge will be to find new ways to investigate
molecular and cellular processes under field conditions.</i></h4><hr>
Identifying and understanding the biotransformation and biodegradation of organic
and inorganic contaminants will require close integration of laboratory and field
experiments.  Research areas include aspects of microbial physiology, enzymology,
biochemistry, chemistry, microbial ecology, and plant-microorganism interactions. 
This program element will emphasize metal and radionuclide biotransformations and
contaminant biotransformations under field conditions.  The role of consortia in
contaminant biotransformations will be an explicit component of both laboratory
and field investigations.  Research carried out under this program element will
include all members of soil and water communities, including plants, rhizosphere
members, eukaryotes, and prokaryotes.  Although the goal of this element is the
understanding of biodegradation and biotransformation under field conditions,
attaining this understanding will require experiments with pure contaminants and
pure cultures under defined conditions.  Achieving the goals of this program element
will require development of improved experimental laboratory microcosms that
qualitatively and quantitatively reflect field mechanisms and processes.  The
scientific focus of this element is the field and not the laboratory microcosm, and an
important challenge will be to find new ways to investigate molecular
and cellular processes under field conditions.  <p>
Investigations and the expected results will integrate closely with those
of the other program elements.  Examples of important linkages with the
other elements include: identifying rate-limiting enzymatic steps and
enzymes as potential targets for the Biomolecular Science and
Engineering element; developing the understanding of contaminant
transformations required to better assess bioremediation endpoints and
performance in the Assessment element; and providing fundamental
kinetic data required for the System Integration, Prediction and
Optimization element and the Acceleration element.<p>
The Biotransformation and Biodegradation element will focus on four
subelements:<p>
<MENU>
1.              Biotransformations of metals and radionuclides.<p>
2.              Pathways, processes, and molecules for degradation of mixtures of
                organic contaminants.<p>
3.              Interactions between metals and radionuclides, and organics.<p>
4.              Kinetics of biotransformation and biodegradation processes under
                field conditions.<p>

<i>Fundamental research on those mechanisms that affect the speciation, bioavailability,
mobilization, immobilization, and transport of metals and radionuclides in the environment. </i>
<p>
<h4>Objective</h4>

<hr>
                To understand biotransformation of metals and radionuclides in sufficient detail to
                improve the bioremediation of toxic metals and radionuclides in the
                environment.<p>
                <h4>Goals</H4>
                
<hr>
<i>Three-Year </i><p>
Identify the dominant redox processes catalyzed by microorganisms and other biota
that affect metal speciation, toxicity, and mobility in soils, sediments, and waters. 
Achieving this goal will involve initial characterization of mechanisms for
microbially mediated metal redox reactions and estimation of the importance and
potential applicability of these redox reactions in the field.  Results obtained will
help to identify systems for more detailed study in subsequent years.<p>
Identify and initially characterize biomineralogical processes which affect the
mobility and toxicity of toxic metals and radionuclides in soils, sediments, and
waters.  As with the first goal in this subelement, these results will be used to
identify important systems and scientific questions for future study.<p>
Identify those biological processes involving complexation and bioaccumulation of
toxic metals and radionuclides that either immobilize or mobilize metals and
radionuclides in the environment.  This area of research encompasses extracellular
metal complexation, complexation to cell surfaces, and intracellular processes for
bioaccumulation.  <p>

reduction of metals and radionuclides and their mobilization or immobilization. 
<p>
Characterize the role of microbial action on the formation and transport of colloids
containing toxic metals and radionuclides in the environment.  Because of the
multiple mechanisms potentially involved in colloid formation and transport,
achieving this goal will require collaboration with other subelements within the
Biotransformation and Biodegradation element (complexation with extracellular
products and with cell surfaces) and with the Biogeochemical Dynamics element.

or <I>ex situ</I> in reactors.  Identify the scientific challenges to application of
these methods in the field.  <p>
Identify promising targets for biomolecular engineering.  Achieving this goal will
involve identifying rate-limiting steps in the biodegradation of contaminants and
developing methods for identifying and purifying the enzymes or other molecules
catalyzing those steps.  This goal will include characterization of the catalytic
mechanism involved in order to aid in the rational modification of molecules for
enhanced activity.<p>
Identify pathway end products and intermediates produced during biodegradation
that can be used to measure or assess activity.  The purpose is to discover and
develop strategies for better measurement of bioremediation activities in the
field.<p>

practices and performance in the field.  <p>
<h3>Subelement 1.3:  Interactions between Toxic Metals,
Radionuclides, and Organic Contaminants</h3> <p>
<i>Fundamental research on the biologically mediated interactions between toxic metals,
radionuclides, and organics.</i>   <p>
<H4>Objective</H4>


<hr>
                To understand how and why the presence of toxic metals or radionuclides at a site
                affects the biodegradation of organics and how biodegradation of contaminants and
                other organics affects the speciation and mobility of metals and radionuclides.  <p>
                <h4>Goals</H4>
                
                
<hr>
<i>Three-Year </i><p>
Identify and characterize mechanisms whereby biota modify the speciation, mobility,
and toxicity of toxic metals and radionuclides during biodegradation of organic
contaminants or organic matter.  These mechanisms include, for example, the
biodegradation of organic complexing agents and the modification of soil organic
matter.  <p>
Identify and characterize radiological and chemical toxicity and mechanisms for
mediation of this toxicity to microorganisms catalyzing beneficial
biotransformations of contaminants.  <p>
<i>Five-Year </i> <p>

Biodegradation Processes under Field Conditions </h3><p>
<i>Fundamental research in the kinetics of multi-step, multi-component biodegradation and
biotransformation pathways.</i><p>
<H4>Objective</H4>


<hr>
                To obtain data describing the rates and extents of contaminant biotransformations

                models to elucidate the complex interactions important during bioremediation in the
                field.  <p>
                <h4>Goals</H4>
                
                
<hr>
<i>Three-Year </i> <p>
Initiate studies on the kinetics of coupled biological processes (e.g., cell transport,
enzyme transformations of contaminants, cell growth, competition and predation,
and feedback inhibition) for the biotransformation of mixtures of contaminants. 
Although the kinetics of biological processes will be emphasized in this subelement,
thermodynamics and reversibility of relevant biotransformations will also be
considered.  The results of these studies will be used in collaboration with the
System Integration element to develop mechanistic models for biodegradation and
biotransformation processes at field sites.  These studies are directed at identifying
(in concert with the Systems Integration, Biogeochemical Dynamics, and
Acceleration elements) those processes that have the most value for predicting and
improving the performance of bioremediation under field conditions.  Therefore,
studies of nutrient and substrate limiting conditions, field temperatures, consortia,
and other conditions particularly relevant to the field will be emphasized.  <p>
<i>Five-Year </i> <p>
Extend investigations of the kinetics of coupled biological processes to field
experimental centers and to a more comprehensive collection of contaminants and
environmental conditions.<p>
Test the validity, applicability, and ability of the models to predict bioremediation
based on the interrelationships of biological, chemical, and physical processes at
field experimental centers.  Uncertainties of model predictions and sensitivity to
accuracies of measured parameters will also be addressed.<p>
<i>Ten-Year </i> <p>
Attain a quantitative and mechanistic understanding of the kinetics and
thermodynamics of biodegradation and biotransformation processes to improve
bioremediation practices and performance in the field.  <p>
