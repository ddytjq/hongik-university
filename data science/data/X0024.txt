<h1>ARTICLE VIII - DISC GOLF</h1>

<p><u>Comment</u>: The growing popularity of the game of disc
golf begins with the essential fact that throwing a flying disc
with power and accuracy is a marvelous sensation. The constant
challenge, the social nature of the game, the good physical and
mental conditioning, and the fact that it is inexpensive to play
are also attractions. Disc golf is a recreational sport for
everybody, regardless of age, gender, or ability. The object of
the game is to traverse a course from beginning to end in the
fewest number of throws of the disc. Each consecutive throw is
made from where the disc came to rest after the last throw. Score
is determined by counting the number of throws made on each hole
plus penalty throws and then summing all holes. The winner is the
player who completes the course with the lowest score. The course
consists of a series of holes laid out so that when the player
completes one hole he or she proceeds to the beginning of the
next until all the holes have been played. The player is provided
with a teeing area from which to begin each hole and a target to
complete the hole. Disc golf courses are normally laid out among
wooded areas with diverse terrain to provide natural obstacles to
the flight of the disc. These natural obstacles are very much a
part of the game and must not be altered by the players in any
way to decrease the difficulty of a hole. Disc golf courses are
normally 18 holes in length, but there are also 9-hole, 24-hole
and 27-hole courses in existence. Disc golf courses can be found
in each of the 50 United States and in Canada, Japan, Australia,
New Zealand, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Netherlands, Switzerland,
Germany, Finland, Hungary, United Kingdom, Peru, and Africa. Disc
golf is a game that expects high standards of etiquette and
courtesy. Among the basic considerations of etiquette are such
things as concern for spectators and other players and respect
for plant life on the course. These rules have been designed to
promote fair play for all disc golfers. In using these rules,
players should apply the rule that most directly addresses the
situation in question. If in doubt, players should consult an
official.</p>

                    <li>A. Players should not throw until they
                        are certain that the thrown disc will not
                        distract another player or potentially
                        injure anyone present. Players should
                        watch the other members of their group
                        throw in order to aid in locating errant
                        throws and to ensure compliance with the
                        rules. </li>
                    <li>B. Players should take care not to
                        produce any distracting noises or any
                        potential visual distractions for other
                        players who are throwing. Examples of
                        discourteous actions are: shouting,
                        freestyling, slapping course equipment,
                        throwing out of turn, throwing or kicking
                        golf bags, and advancing on the fairway
                        beyond the away player. Shouting at an
                        appropriate time to warn someone in
                        danger of being struck by a disc is not a
                        violation of courtesy. </li>
                    <li>C. Refusal to perform an action expected
                        by the rules, such as assisting in the
                        search for a lost disc, moving discs or
                        equipment, or keeping score properly,
                        etc., is a courtesy violation. </li>
                    <li>D. Littering is a courtesy violation. </li>
                    <li>E. Courtesy dictates that players who
                        smoke should not allow their smoke to
                        disturb other players. Smokers should
                        extinguish their cigarettes and carry
                        their cigarette butts to a trash can.
                        Disposing of cigarette butts by dropping
                        them on the ground is littering. </li>
                    <li>F. A player violating a courtesy rule may
                        be warned by any affected player, even if
                        from another group, or by an official,
                        with all players of the group advised of
                        the warning. The player shall be assessed
                        one penalty throw for each subsequent
                        courtesy violation of any type in the
                        same round. Repeated violations of
                        courtesy rules may result in
                        disqualification in accordance with <a
                        href="#804.05">section 804.05.</a> </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a name="801.02"></a>801.02 <u>Order of Play:</u>
                <ul>
                    <li>A. Teeing order on the first teeing area
                        is determined by the order in which the
                        scorecards were filled out or by the
                        order the players were listed or arranged
                        on the scoreboard. </li>
                    <li>B. Teeing order on all subsequent tees is
                        determined by the scores on the previous
                        hole, with the lowest score throwing
                        first, and so on. If the previous hole
                        was a tie, the scores are to be counted
                        back until the order is resolved. </li>
                    <li>C. After all the players in the group
                        have teed off, the player farthest from
                        the hole, (the away player), throws
                        first. </li>
                    <li>D. During tournament play, no group may
                        play through the group ahead unless the
                        group ahead is required to stand aside in
                        accordance with the rules or as directed
                        by an official. </li>
                    <li>E. Throwing out of turn shall be
                        considered a courtesy violation. See
                        801.01 F. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>A. A maximum of 30 seconds is allowed to
                        each player to make a throw after: <ul>
                            <li>(1) the previous player has
                                thrown; and, </li>
                            <li>(2) the player has taken a
                                reasonable time to arrive at the
                                disc and mark the lie; and, </li>
                            <li>(3) the playing area is clear and
                                free of distractions. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>B. A player shall receive a warning for
                        the first excessive time violation if
                        observed by two or more players of the
                        group or an official. The player shall be
                        assessed one penalty throw for each
                        subsequent excessive time violation in
                        the same round if observed by two or more
                        players of the group or an official. </li>

                the Stipulated Course:</u> <ul>
                    <li>A. It is the responsibility of the player
                        to play the course correctly. Before play
                        begins, players should ask about any
                        special conditions that may exist on the
                        course, including extra holes, alternate
                        teeing areas, alternate hole placements,
                        out-of-bounds areas, and mandatories. </li>
                    <li>B. <i>Specific Types of Misplay and
                        Penalty Procedures for Each</i>: <ul>
                            <li>(1) <i>Wrong Tee</i>: Teeing off
                                from the wrong teeing area among
                                several teeing areas for a given
                                hole. If the misplay is
                                discovered after the player's
                                throw from the incorrect teeing
                                area, but before a subsequent
                                throw, the player shall re-tee
                                from the correct teeing area and
                                treat the initial throw as a
                                practice throw (one throw added
                                to the player's score). If the
                                misplay is discovered after a
                                subsequent throw, the player
                                shall proceed to complete the
                                hole and receive a two-throw
                                penalty for the misplay. </li>
                            <li>(2) <i>Misplayed Mandatory</i>:
                                Failing to attempt to navigate a
                                mandatory route. If the misplay
                                is discovered after a player's
                                throw has passed beyond the
                                mandatory on the wrong side, but
                                before a subsequent throw has
                                been made, the player shall
                                unwind as required by 803.11 B
                                and C without penalty, counting
                                all throws made. If the misplay

                                a subsequent throw has been made,
                                the player shall finish the hole
                                without unwinding.and receive a
                                two-throw penalty for the
                                misplay. </li>
                            <li>(3) <i>Wrong Target</i>: Throwing
                                at the wrong target. If the
                                misplay is discovered before the
                                player has holed out at the
                                incorrect target, the player
                                shall proceed to hole out at the

                                throws actually made, without
                                penalty. If a player has thrown
                                for the correct target but has
                                inadvertently holed out on an
                                incorrect target, no course
                                misplay has occurred. The player
                                shall mark his or her lie within
                                one meter of the incorrect
                                target, without penalty, and

                                provisional throws. When taking
                                provisional throws, the thrower
                                shall complete the hole being
                                played under the alternative
                                rulings advocated within the
                                group. The eventual final ruling,
                                made by an official or the
                                director or the director's
                                designee, shall count only those
                                throws made under the proper
                                rules interpretation. The unused
                                throws shall not be added to the
                                thrower's score nor treated as
                                practice throws. If an official
                                is not readily available to
                                decide an appeal immediately
                                following the round (or during
                                the round where practical), the
                                group shall locate an official
                                for a ruling. </li>
                            <li>(4) A player may seek an appeal
                                of an official's ruling to the
                                director or director's designee.
                                If the director or director's
                                designee is readily available,
                                the appeal shall be heard
                                directly. The group shall stand
                                aside awaiting the ruling on
                                appeal. If the director or
                                director's designee is not
                                readily available, the group
                                shall continue playing under the
                                official's ruling. The appeal
                                shall be made as soon as
                                practical. The decision of the
                                director or the director's
                                designee shall be final. </li>
                            <li>(5) Where a group's or official's
                                decision is overturned on appeal,
                                the official (or director or
                                director's designee) may, in the
                                interest of fairness, allow the
                                thrower's score to remain the
                                same or adjust the thrower's
                                score to reflect the correct
                                interpretation of the rules. Only
                                in a case where a replay is the
                                most fair solution should a hole
                                or holes be replayed. </li>

                    </li>
                    <li>D. A player shall not receive a warning
                        for a rules violation unless the rule
                        specifically provides for a warning.
                        Warnings do not carry over from one round
                        to the next round or to a playoff. </li>
                    <li>E. If any point in dispute is not covered
                        by the rules, the decision shall be made
                        in accordance with fairness. Often a
                        logical extension of the closest existing
                        rule or the principles embodied in these
                        rules will provide guidance for
                        determining fairness. </li>

                    <li>A. Play shall begin on each hole with the
                        player throwing from within the teeing
                        area. When the disc is released, at least
                        one of the player's supporting points
                        must be in contact with the surface of
                        the teeing area, and all the player's
                        supporting points must be within the
                        teeing area. If a tee pad is provided,
                        all supporting points must be on the pad
                        at the time of release, unless the
                        director has specified a modified teeing
                        area for safety reasons. If no tee pad is
                        provided, all supporting points at the
                        time of release must be within an area
                        encompassed by the front line of the
                        teeing area and two lines perpendicular
                        to and extending back three meters from
                        each end of the front line. Running up
                        from behind the teeing area before the
                        disc is released is permitted. Following
                        through in front of the teeing area is
                        permitted provided there is no supporting
                        point contact outside the teeing area
                        when the disc is released. </li>
                    <li>B. Any supporting point contact outside
                        the teeing area at the time of release
                        constitutes a stance violation and shall

                <ul>
                    <li>A. After the tee off, the thrown disc
                        must be left where it came to rest until
                        a mini marker disc is placed on the
                        playing surface between the hole and the
                        disc, directly in line with the hole,
                        touching the thrown disc. The mini marker
                        disc may not be moved until the throw is
                        released. A mini marker disc
                        inadvertently moved prior to the throw
                        shall be returned to its correct
                        location. </li>
                    <li>B. If the thrown disc comes to rest
                        in-bounds but within one meter of an
                        out-of-bounds line, the lie is marked by
                        placing a mini marker disc up to one
                        meter away from, and perpendicular to,
                        the nearest out-of-bounds line. This
                        holds true even if the direction takes
                        the lie closer to the hole. See the
                        following sections for other
                        consideration in marking a thrown disc: <ul>

                    </li>
                    <li>C. <i>The Rule of Verticality:</i> The
                        out-of-bounds line represents a vertical
                        plane. Where a player's lie is marked
                        from a particular point within one meter
                        of the out-of-bounds line pursuant to the
                        rules, the one-meter relief may be taken
                        from the particular point upward or
                        downward along the vertical plane. </li>
                    <li>D. If the thrown disc breaks and comes to
                        rest in more than one piece, the largest
                        piece, as agreed to by a majority of the
                        group or an official, is deemed to be the
                        thrown disc. </li>
                    <li>E. A disc thrown in water shall be deemed
                        to be at rest once it is floating or is
                        moving only by the action of the water or
                        the wind on the water. </li>
                    <li>F. A player shall receive a warning for
                        the first violation of a marking rule if
                        observed by two or more players of the
                        group or an official. One penalty throw
                        shall be assessed for each subsequent
                        violation of any marking rule during the
                        round if observed by two or more players
                        of the group or an official. </li>

                    <li>A. When the disc is released, a player
                        must: <ul>
                            <li>(1) Have at least one supporting
                                point that is in contact with the
                                playing surface on the line of
                                play and within 30 centimeters
                                directly behind the mini marker
                                disc (except as specified in
                                803.03 E); and, </li>
                            <li>(2) have no supporting point
                                contact with the mini marker disc
                                or any object closer to the hole
                                than the rear edge of the mini
                                marker disc; and, </li>
                            <li>(3) have all of his or her
                                supporting points in-bounds. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>B. Stepping past the mini marker disc is
                        permitted after the disc is released,
                        except when putting within 10 meters. </li>
                    <li>C. Any throw from within 10 meters or
                        less, as measured from the rear of the
                        mini marker disc to the base of the hole,
                        is considered a putt. A follow-through
                        after a putt that causes the thrower to
                        make any supporting point contact closer
                        to the hole than the rear edge of the
                        mini marker disc constitutes a falling
                        putt and is not allowed. The player must
                        demonstrate full control of balance
                        before advancing toward the hole. </li>
                    <li>D. A player must choose the stance that
                        will result in the least movement of any
                        part of any obstacle that is a permanent
                        or integral part of the course. </li>
                    <li>E. If a large solid obstacle prevents a
                        player from taking a legal stance within
                        30 centimeters directly behind the mini
                        marker disc, the player shall take his or
                        her stance immediately behind that
                        obstacle on the line of play. The player
                        must comply with all the provisions of
                        803.03 A other than being within 30
                        centimeters directly behind the mini
                        marker disc. </li>
                    <li>F. A stance violation must be clearly
                        called within three seconds after the
                        infraction to be valid. The call may be
                        made by any member of the group or an
                        official. When the call is made by a
                        member of the group, it must subsequently
                        be confirmed by another member of the
                        group. A player shall receive a warning
                        for the first violation of a stance rule
                        in the round. Subsequent violations of a
                        stance rule in the same round shall incur
                        a one-throw penalty. </li>
                    <li>G. Any throw that involves a validly
                        called and seconded stance violation may
                        not be used by the thrower. Re-throws
                        must be taken from the original lie.
                        Re-throws must be taken prior to
                        subsequent play by others in the group. </li>
                    <li>H. The player may not retrieve the
                        originally thrown disc prior to the
                        re-throw, except in the case of a putt
                        from within 10 meters. Where a disc is

                    <li>A. <i>Permanent or Integral obstacles to
                        a Stance or Throwing Motion: </i>Players
                        must choose a stance which results in the
                        least movement of any part of an obstacle
                        that is a permanent or integral part of
                        the course. Once a legal stance is taken,
                        a player may not move an obstacle (or
                        hold it back or bend it) in order to make
                        room for a throwing motion. See 803.04 C
                        for relief a player may obtain for
                        certain casual obstacles prior to taking
                        a stance. It is legal for a player's
                        throwing motion to make incidental
                        movement of an obstacle. </li>
                    <li>B. <i>Obstacles Between the Lie and Hole</i>:
                        A player may not move, alter, bend, or
                        hold back any part of any obstacle
                        between the lie and the hole, with one
                        exception. A player may move obstacles
                        between the lie and the hole that became
                        a factor during the round, such as
                        spectators, players' equipment, open
                        gates, or branches that fell during the
                        round. Where it is not known if an
                        obstacle has become a factor during a
                        round, it shall not be moved. It is legal
                        for a player's throwing motion to make
                        incidental movement of an obstacle. </li>
                    <li>C. <i>Casual Obstacles:</i> A player may
                        obtain relief only from the following
                        obstacles: casual water, loose leaves or
                        debris, broken branches no longer
                        connected to a tree, motor vehicles,
                        harmful insects or animals, players'
                        equipment, spectators, or any item or
                        area specifically designated by the
                        director before the round. The type of
                        relief a player may obtain is based on
                        the location of the obstacle and is
                        limited as follows: <ul>
                            <li>(1) <i>Obstacles between the lie
                                and the hole</i>: No relief is
                                granted except for obstacles
                                which became a factor during the
                                round as described by 803.04 B. </li>
                            <li>(2) <i>Obstacles to stance or
                                throwing motion</i>: The player
                                must first attempt to remove the
                                obstacle. If this is impractical,
                                the player's lie may be relocated
                                to the nearest lie which is no
                                closer to the hole; is on the
                                line of play; and not more than
                                five meters from the original
                                lie, as agreed to by a majority

                                (unless greater casual relief is
                                announced by the director).
                                Alternatively, the player may
                                declare an unsafe lie and proceed
                                in accordance with 803.05. </li>
                            <li>(3) <i>Obstacles to a run up:</i>
                                The player may move the obstacle.
                                No other relief is provided. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>D. In situations where it is unclear if
                        an object may be moved or other relief
                        obtained, it shall be determined by a
                        majority of the group or an official. </li>
                    <li>E. A player shall receive one penalty
                        throw, without a warning, for violation
                        of an obstacle or relief rule. A player
                        who consciously damages anything on the
                        course shall receive two penalty throws,
                        without a warning, if observed by two or
                        more players of the group or an official.
                        The player may also be disqualified from

                        played where it comes to rest. A thrown

                        close as possible to the point of
                        contact, as determined by a majority of
                        the group or an official. Players should
                        not stand or leave their equipment where
                        interference with the flight or path of a
                        disc could easily occur. The away player
                        may require other players to mark their
                        lies or move their equipment before
                        making a throw if the player believes
                        that either could interfere with his or
                        her throw. </li>
                    <li>B. If a disc at rest is moved, the disc
                        shall be replaced as close as possible to
                        its original location, as determined by a

                        of the disc to the playing surface
                        directly below it, the player shall be

                        meters above the playing surface before
                        the thrower arrives at the disc. The

                        or an official shall make the
                        determination. If the thrower moves the

                    <li>B. A player whose disc is considered
                        out-of-bounds shall receive one penalty
                        throw. The player shall mark his or her

                        be distributed to the player listed first
                        on each hole. After the cards have been
                        distributed, groups shall be given
                        adequate time to reach their assigned
                        teeing areas. A loud noisemaker, such as
                        an air horn, shall be used to indicate
                        that there are two minutes remaining

                        practice shots and move promptly to their
                        teeing areas. A throw by a player between
                        the two minute signal and the start of
                        the round shall receive a warning if
                        observed by two or more players or an
                        official. After being warned, subsequent

                        throw added to the player's score,
                        regardless of the number of throws. An
                        extended blast of the noisemaker begins
                        the round and signals the scorekeepers to
                        call the throwing orders. If a player is
                        not present to throw when it is his or
                        her turn, the scorekeeper shall allow 30
                        seconds. If the player has not thrown
                        after the 30 seconds has elapsed, a score
                        of par plus four is to be entered for

                        as much as practicable. </li>

                        where fewer than three players are
                        required to play together, an official is
                        required to accompany the group and may
                        play as long as this does not interfere
                        with the competing players. </li>
                    <li>D. When there are more entrants than can
                        play together in one round, the field of
                        competitors may be split into sections.
                        These sections shall be seeded, i.e.,
                        each section should have an equal number
                        of top players and lesser players. </li>

                        play among seeded sections, the director
                        may consider using a sectioning procedure
                        for cut and advancement. Under this

                        advance. </li>

                        being reset, tied positions shall be
                        broken. The player with the lowest score
                        in the most recent round shall have the
                        highest ranking when the
                        scorecards/positions are reset. In the
                        event of low score ties, the ties shall
                        be broken by the director through any
                        consistently applied manner. </li>
                    <li>C. Final ties for first place must be
                        broken by sudden death play. Sudden death
                        play shall begin with hole number one
                        unless a different hole is designated by
                        the director prior to the start of the
                        tournament. Final ties for other ranks
                        shall be officially recorded as ties.
                        Prize money distribution to tied players
                        shall be determined by adding the total

                        positions represented by the tied players
                        and dividing that by the number of

                        size restrictions) </li>
                    <li><u>Obstacle</u>: Any feature of the
                        course that may impede any aspect of

                        area designated by the director prior to
                        the start of play from which a disc may
                        not be played. The out-of-bounds line
                        extends a plane vertically upward and

                        would be expected to make on a given
                        hole. Par means errorless play under
                        ordinary weather conditions, allowing two
                        close range throws to hole-out. </li>
                    <li><u>Penalty Throw</u>: A throw added to a
                        player's score for violating a rule, or
                        for relocation of a lie, as called for by

                        greater than two meters, or of any
                        distance toward a target, intentional or
                        not, which does not change the player's
                        lie, either because it did not occur from
                        the teeing area or the lie, or because
                        the player had already thrown
                        competitively from the teeing area or the
                        lie. Throws that are re-thrown in
                        accordance with the rules are not
                        practice throws. Provisional throws made
                        pursuant to <a href="#803">803.00 C(3)</a>
                        are not practice throws. A player shall
                        receive a penalty for practice throws in
                        accordance with sections <a href="#803">803.00
                        B</a> or <a href="#804.02">804.02 A</a>. </li>

                        less as measured from the rear of the
                        mini marker disc to the base of the hole
                        is considered a putt. </li>

                        a player touches his or her mini marker
                        disc, or any object beyond the lie,
                        including the playing surface, before
                        having demonstrated full control of
                        balance. </li>
                    <li><u>Relief:</u> A change made to the
                        player's lie or surrounding area, such
                        that an obstacle is removed from the
                        vicinity, or when that is impractical,
                        the lie is relocated away from the
                        obstacle in accordance with <a
                        href="#803.04">section 803.04 C</a>. </li>
                    <li><u>Supporting Point</u>: Any part of a
                        player's body that is in contact with the
                        playing surface or some other object
                        capable of providing support, at the time
                        of release. </li>
                    <li><u>Teeing Area</u>: The area bounded by
                        the edges of a tee pad (if provided);
                        otherwise, the area extending three
                        meters perpendicularly behind the
                        designated tee line. </li>
                    <li><u>Throw</u>: The propulsion of a disc
                        that causes it to change its position
                        from the teeing area or the lie. </li>
                    <li><u>Thrower</u>: The player who has made,
                        or is about to make, a throw that is the
                        aspect of play being considered by a
                        particular rule. </li>
                    <li><u>Unsafe Lie</u>: A lie from which a
                        player decides that obstacles to stance
                        or throwing motion make it impractical or
                        unsafe to attempt a throw. The lie is
                        relocated with a penalty.</li>
                    <li><u>Warning</u>: Where prescribed by a
                        rule, the initial advisement a player is
                        given for violating that rule, making him
                        or her vulnerable to receiving a penalty
                        throw for subsequent violations of that
                        rule or set of rules within the same
