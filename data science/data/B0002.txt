<br clear="all"><p>Beverley Building Society offers a variety of mortgage products all designed to meet
your personal requirements. As the local building society, we have vast experience of the culture,
employment and housing in the area, which helps us adapt to your particular needs.</p>

<P>For instance, the Society's residential mortgage interest rate is currently half a percent below the
majority of high street lenders. This product will not of course cater for all our customers' needs and therefore
the Society has other options available including flexible, tracker, fixed rate, discounted and first time buyer  schemes.</p>

<p><img src="images/mortgage2.gif" width="200" height="118" align="right" border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt=""></p>

<P clear=all>At Beverley Building Society, we can tailor-make a mortgage to meet your individual
requirements. Our approach means that a combination of products can be blended to give you
flexibility. Our qualified and helpful staff are always eager to listen to your needs and help you find
the right mortgage.</p>

<P>So whether you are an existing homeowner, thinking of additional borrowing, planning to move, or
buying your first home, come and talk to us. We will give you an honest and open answer and you will be
surprised how we can personalise a mortgage to review your particular needs.</p><P>And don't forget, if
you have your current mortgage elsewhere, we would welcome the opportunity to meet your mortgage
requirements.</p>

<A name="top"><p>On all our products the Society will fund any higher lending fee where the
mortgage is up to 90% of the purchase price or valuation whichever is the lower. Mortgage
products currently available include:</p></a>

</ul>
</p>

<P>When you choose a fixed rate mortgage, not only do you know that your household budget won't be affected by interest
rate change, but in addition:</p>

<P>
<ul>
<li>There is no early repayment charge beyond the fixed rate period</dd>
<li>You don't have to take our property insurance</dd>
<li>You don't have to be moving home to apply for these fixed rates</dd>
</ul>
</p>

<P>What's more, if you want to move home before your fixed rate ends, you can take the fixed rate (up
to the original loan amount) with you as part of your new loan.</p>

<P><B>But Hurry</B><br>
Fixed rate funds are limited and these offers may be withdrawn at short notice.<br>
To avoid disappointment, you should send your completed application form to
us without delay.</p>

<ul>
<li>There is no tie-in after the fixed rate ends.
<li>All we ask is that you keep your loan for at least the duration of the fixed rate period.
<li>If you wish to repay the loan earlier a redemption charge of 5% of the amount repaid will be made, eg if £10,000 is repaid the charge will be £10,000 x 5% = £500.
</ul>
</p>

<P><B>How it works</B><br>
With these loans, the interest rate you pay remains the same for the fixed rate period, whether our
variable base mortgage rate goes higher or lower than the fixed rate you have chosen.</p>

<P><B>Administration charge</B><BR>
The fixed rate products have a completion fee of £295 which will be added to the mortgage account.</p>

<P><B>When the fixed rate ends</B><BR>
At the end of the fixed rate period, your loan will switch to our  '<A href="#loyalmember">Residential</a>'
variable rate, currently 5.25% <b>APR of 5.70%</b>.</p>
<p>This rate is currently 0.65% below the Society's variable base mortgage rate. <BR>
It could be higher or lower than the rate you have been paying and may vary over the remaining term of
your mortgage.</p>

<P><B>Early Repayment charge</B><BR>
If you repay your loan or make a capital repayment before 31st March 2007, you will have to pay an early repayment charge of 4% of the amount repaid will be made e.g if £10,000 is repaid the charge will be £10,000 x 4% = £400. The charge will not apply if you move the loan to another house.</p>
