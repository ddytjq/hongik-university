<h3><a name="detail">The Seminars in Detail</a></h3>

<dl>
<dt><strong>James O. Coplien</strong>
<dd>Jim Coplien is a Distinguished Member of Technical Staff with Bell
    Laboratories in Naperville, Illinois. He is one of the founders of
    the software pattern discipline and a pioneer in the areas of
    organisational patterns and multi-paradigm design.
<dt><strong>Keynote: Teaching Design, The Rest is SMOP</strong>
<dd>Most U.S. CS curricula rarely give the topic of design its proper
    place as the dominant factor distinguishing software development
    success from failure. Using the CMM, the Bloom taxonomy for
    cognitive learning, and practical feedback from the software community,
    Jim will explore the current state of affairs in software development
    education and suggest some strategies that can integrate university
    programs with industrial experience to overcome these problems.

<dt><strong>Development with Patterns</strong>
<dd>Patterns started out as idioms. But good patterns should precipitate
    from pattern languages. At the whimsical risk of presenting what is a
    purely idiomatic language, Coplien casts his well-known idioms in
    pattern form, showing how they form a true Alexandrian pattern
    language. The talk aims to give the audience an effective appreciation
    of advanced C++ programming techniques and a solid intuition of what
    pattern languages are.
<dt><strong>Who is it intended for?</strong>
<dd>Those working in software design and development using C++, the concept
    of patterns, OO, knowledge on basis UML notation, and, ideally, some
    experiences with distributed/concurrent systems.

<dt><strong>Herb Sutter</strong>
<dd>Herb Sutter is Chief Technology Officer at PeerDirect Inc. and a
    leading expert on distributed databases.  He is an active voting
    member of the ISO/ANSI C++ and SQL standards committees, author of the
    books, Exceptional C++ and the forthcoming, Peer Distributed Databases
    (Addison-Wesley), and a columnist for C++ Report. He holds issued or
    pending patents covering several dozen innovations in the fields of
    distributed databases, distributed networks, and cryptographic security
    for databases.
<dt><strong>Exception Safe C++</strong>
<dd>Exceptions can be an elegant solution to some problems, but must be
    used carefully. This talk answers the questions: When is exception
    safety important? What are the levels of exception safety? Where and how
    does your code need to be reinforced to protect itself? What coding
    idioms will help make your code exception-safe? And, finally: Is the
    Standard C++ library itself exception-safe, and if so, what guarantees
    does it provide?
<dt><strong>Who is it intended for?</strong>
<dd>Programmers interested in writing robust software with an understanding
    of C++ fundamentals.

<dt><strong>KEYNOTE: Programming in the Distributed Millennium</strong>
<dd>Where are we as C, C++, and Java programmers, and where are we going?
    This talk covers both. First, it analyses the state of the art in
    modern distributed systems alternatives, from N-tier and web-based
    approaches to load-balanced and synchronous/asynchronous Internet
    replicated systems, and how to choose among them. Second, it analyses
    current trends toward pervasive computing and the emerging palmtop
    and embedded products, extrapolating a distributed vision of our
    industry's near-term future and showing how that vision will affect
    the way we write software. As the only expert to sit on both the C++
    and SQL standards committees, and the chief architect of the world's
    only peer-to-peer database replication platform, Herb is uniquely
    qualified to deliver on this sweeping theme.

<dt><strong>Andy Longshaw</strong>
<dd>Andy is a Principal Technologist with Content Master Ltd., a
    company which turns information into knowledge and knowledge into
    understanding. Andy has designed, created and delivered technical
    training and consultancy on many aspects of Java, XML and
    components.
<dt><strong>Creating Web-based Systems with Java Server Pages (JSP)</strong>
<dd>Java Server Pages (JSP) technology allows developers of web-based
    applications to augment an HTML page with chunks of Java which are
    executed on the server. When the code is run it can access any
    server-side resource to dynamically create HTML that is then fed down
    to the calling client. This session will examine how JSP work,their
    relationship to Java servlets and the use of JavaBeans in JSP. It will
    examine how JSP and servlets fit into the J2EE architecture and how
    JSP compare to Microsoft's Active Server Pages technology
<dt><strong>Who is it intended for?</strong>
<dd>Developers with a reading understanding of Java, with some understanding
    of web-based systems.
<dt><strong>SAX and DOM and Rock and Roll</strong>
<dd>Much has been written on how well Java and XML fit together. This
    session will examine the two most popular mechanisms for manipulating
    XML from Java - the Simple API for XML (SAX) and the Document Object
    Model (DOM). It will look at the mechanics of each mechanism together
    with the advantages and disadvantages of each.

<dd>Dov Bulka has spent fifteen years in the trenches of software
    development, delivering large-scale software products to market. He
    was the performance architect of the IBM Domino-Go Web server
    that has powered some of the biggest Web sites ever hosted on the
    Internet, including that of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. He received his
    Ph.D. in computer science from Duke University. He is the author of,
    Efficient C++ (Addison-Wesley, 1999)
<dt><strong>Efficient C++</strong>
<dd>This presentation will demonstrate the potential of C++ to produce
    highly efficient software. It will reveal practical, object-oriented
    design principles and C++ coding techniques that can yield large
    performance improvements. Dov will also discuss the common pitfalls
    in both design and code that generate hidden operating costs.
<dt><strong>Who is it intended for?</strong>

<dt><strong>Java Performance and Scalability</strong>
<dd>There's no question that Java gives programmers a significant
    productivity boost by making complex tasks seem very easy. That
    productivity boost comes with a hefty performance price-tag. A simple
    Java statement could often result in thousands of machine instructions.
    This talk will help you navigate around those Java performance pitfalls
    trying to avoid costly operations. There are many ways to achieve a
    computational task, some are faster than others. This talk will
    provide practical techniques to significantly boost the speed of your
    Java code.
<dt><strong>Who is it intended for?</strong>

<dt><strong>Dietmar Kuehl</strong>
<dd>Dietmar Kuehl was born in 1968 and finished his Diploma in Mathematics
    in 1997. Since 1997 he's worked as a consultant for Claas Solutions,
    a small company with expertise in the OO area using Smalltalk, Java,
    and C++, mostly for banking applications. Since 1996 Dietmar has
    regularly attended the ISO C++ meetings.
<dt><strong>Object Oriented Programming vs. Generic Programming</strong>
<dd>The first part of the talk will mostly explore difference while the
    second part will talk about combining both approaches, questioning
    the "vs." of the title. OOP and GP address the same goal, the reuse of
    components, but follow different approaches. It's worth investigating
    these differences to determine the areas where the strength of each
    approach lies and to find how these two techniques might be combined
    to improve the overall quality of software.
<dt><strong>Who is it intended for?</strong>
<dd>Everyone using an object oriented language with, ideally, basic
    STL + OOP, although OOP and basic C++ templates will suffice.

    effective Java' published by Addison Wesley. Among other posts,
    Nigel is the consulting Architect to the Enterprise Software Practice
    at Hitachi Europe, a lecturer and trainer.
<dt><strong>A Used Universe : Use and Reuse in Java and CORBA</strong>
<dd>Java and CORBA now use the IIOP as the base line of interaction between
    components within a distributed system.  This has produced a shift in
    emphasis, within the community of ORB users, to focusing on the use
    and quality of the various horizontal and vertical services and taking
    the underlying ORB protocols as a given. A similar shift occours at
    a finer grain level within the development of a Java system.  What
    lessons can be learned from characterising and comparing these
    various forms of use and re-use?
<dt><strong>Who is it intended for?</strong>
<dd>General interest in crafting software systems.

    by Psion from 1995. Martin worked for IBM (UK) from 1985-1993,
    mainly in the systems and networking areas. He holds an MA in
    Natural Sciences and Computer Science from Cambridge University.
<dt><strong>Multi-tasking in EPOC: balancing efficiency, reliability
    and portability</strong>
<dd>Industrial-strength multi-tasking is even more important for
    personal mobile systems than for desktop PCs. EPOC's active object
    and client server frameworks deliver multi-tasking, maximizing ease of
    programming and system efficiency. Martin will introduce these
    frameworks and address the portability issues arising from multi-tasking
    in other frameworks.

    design assistance to development teams in the fields of
    telecommunications, information systems, manufacture, statistical
    analysis and banking. Recently he has been helping define the
    architecture and implementation of several different smart mobile
    phones, which has inspired an interest in techniques for working with
    very restricted systems.
<dt><strong>Patterns for Small Machines - Introducing techniques for
    programming memory - limited systems</strong>
<dd>This tutorial will describe how to develop software for a
    memory-constrained environment using modern O-O languages and methods.
    The author has made an intensive study of the approaches used by
    successful software developers for memory-limited systems. Using an
    approach based on design patterns and practical examples, this tutorial
    will explore some of the most powerful of these techniques.
<dt><strong>Who is it intended for?</strong>
<dd>Intermediate software developers and team leaders with experience
    of using an O-O programming language. Experience of working with 
    memory-limited systems will be helpful but is not essential.

    degree in mathematics. While teaching computer science to technical
    students, he wrote many books about programming, programming languages
    and computer graphics, both in English and in Dutch.
<dt><strong>Introduction to Function Objects</strong>
<dd>Less experienced C++ programmers often find function objects confusing
    since they are based on two non-elementary language concepts:
    anonymous class objects and the call operator. This presentation
    explains how to use function objects: firstly, as an alternative to
    pointers to functions; and, secondly, in connection with the Standard
    Template Library (STL).

    components and distribution.
<dt><strong>Interface Based Development</strong>
<dd>Interfaces between components in software, whether at the function API
    level or executable component level, define and constrain the possible
    relationships within the software and the behaviour of its parts.
    This talk takes a broad view of development based on defining and
    understanding interfaces, focusing on concepts and practices appropriate
    for C, C++, Java, CORBA and COM development.
<dt><strong>Who is it intended for?</strong>
<dd>Everyone, typically working in medium to large teams, or using third
    party software with, at least, development in a curly bracket
    language. Ideal for those with an understanding of OO. Familiarity
    with patterns and component-based development concepts useful.

<dt><strong>Russel Winder</strong>
<dd>Russel Winder is Professor of Computing Science at King's College
    London and Head of Department of the Computer Science Department.
    His interests are in the systems development process and in
    particular the notations used for people to reason about and develop
    the systems that they develop. He has a past in C++ programming and
    a current and future in Java programming having written popular
    learning texts, published by John Wiley & Sons, in both topics.
<dt><strong>Are Patterns All Hype and No Substance?</strong>
<dd>There has been much hype to the concept of patterns over the past
    year or two. Was this just a two year fashion? We are seeing the terms
    object and object-oriented replaced by the term component. Many think
    this a fashion rather than real progression of the field of systems
    development. Have patterns, like object-orientation, therefore become
    passé or is there real substance to what patterns claim to provide?
    There are many texts being written about patterns, mostly associated
    with C++ but increasingly using Java. Many have criticized patterns
    for being over-complicated and too C++ oriented. This presentation
    will address the issues and attempt to come up with a way of testing
    whether this is true or not.
<dt><strong>Who is it intended for?</strong>
<dd>Systems developers with C++ and Java and some knowledge of
    patterns. Interested newcomers to the patterns area would also benefit.

    several concrete, industrial software development projects. Frank is
    co-author of, Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture - A System of
    Patterns.
<dt><strong>Development with Patterns</strong>
<dd>This presentation illustrates how to apply patterns in practise to
    build high-quality software. Using a running example, several
    recurring design problems are raised, which range from architectural
    issues to low-level implementation aspects. For every problem they
    demonstrate how it can be resolved with well-known patterns. The talk
    also summarises the general experiences we have gained in using patterns
    in industrial software development projects.
<dt><strong>Who is it intended for?</strong>

<dd>Joint Managing Director of Dragon Systems UK Research & Development
    Ltd, Cheltenham. John has 30 years experience in speech technology
    research and development in the the British Government and then in
    Dragon Systems, where he now helps direct Dragon's development of
    new speech recognition technology for embedded systems.
<dt><strong>Speech Enabling a World of Applications</strong>
<dd>The future looks very exciting for giving the objects around us the
    ability to respond to spoken commands: embedding speech into non PC
    products such as cars, cellphones and domestic appliances. John Bridle
    is well placed to give insight into the current status of speech
    recognition techniques that will be able to meet the challenges of
    small memory and processor requirements and good system integrity,
    often with poor signal quality and unknown speakers. However, PC
    applications can be speech enabled today, and Bernard Payne will
    close by describing real examples of speech enabled applications using 
    the current Developer Suite.
<dt><strong>Who is it intended for?</strong>
<dd>C++, VB & Delphi developers looking for ways to add value/differentiate
    their applications now and developers working within the embedded sector.
