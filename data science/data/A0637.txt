			<p> You'll need to choose the best way to <b>repay the secured</b> part of your <i>together</i> loan.</p>
			<p>The following is intended only as a brief guide to the various methods of repayment that may potentially be available to you.</p>
			<p>It is important that you understand and feel comfortablewith the choice of repayment method that you make. If you require more information about the different ways of repaying your loan, we can arrange an interview for you to talk with a representative of <NOBR>Legal &amp; General</NOBR>, or you should talk to your own financial advisor.</p>

			<p>CAPITAL AND INTEREST LOANS</p>
			<p>A capital and interest loan (sometimes known as a redeeming or repayment loan) is generally considered to be the most straightforward way of repaying your loan. With this type of loan, you gradually pay off the amount borrowed, over an agreed number of years.</p>
			<p>Your monthly payment covers the interest that we charge for the loan and also repays part of the capital borrowed. In the early years, the largest part of the monthly payment is interest, but as the loan balance reduces each year so does the interest portion. This means that towards the end of the loan term, although your payment itself has not reduced, most of your payment is going towards paying off the remaining loan balance. The loan  will be repaid at the end of the term providing you maintain the repayments. Also with a repayment loan it is also possible to repay your loan early.</p>
			<p><B>The unsecured part of <I>together</I> must be repaid on a capital and interest basis.</B></p>
			<p>As life assurance cover is not built in, we strongly recommend that you consider taking out some form of life cover to repay the loan should you die before the end of the loan term.<a href="javascript:void(0);" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('http://uk.sitestat.com/landg/2155885/s?mstart.nr.term.start.bod.together&ns_type=clickin&ns_url=[https://www02.landg.com/olta/northernRock/index.jsp]','legalandgeneral', '650', '555', 'yes')" ><IMG height=73 alt="Legal and General" hspace=6 src="../../../images/landglogowhite.gif" width  =108 align=right vspace=6 border=0 ></A></p>

			<p>INTEREST ONLY LOANS</p>
			<p>There are a number of different variations of this type of loan.</p>
			<p>All share the common feature that the monthly payment to us represents only the interest charged for the loan and your loan balance does not decrease during the term.</p>
			<p>In order to repay an interest only loan, you will need to arrange a separate Investment Product which will be administered by another organisation. You will need to make regular payments into this product which will be designed to repay your loan at the end of the loan term.</p>
			<p>If you require financial advice we can arrange an interview for you with a representative of <NOBR>Legal &amp; General</NOBR>.</p>
			<p>A general description of the type of plans used to repay interest only loans follows:</p><a name="endowment"></a>
			<p>ENDOWMENT POLICY</p>
			<p>Each month you make your normal loan interest payment to us and make a separate payment to a life assurance company which invests the premiums on your behalf.</p>
			<p>The aim is for the endowment policy to repay the loan on maturity at the end of the term you have selected.</p>
			<p>With an endowment loan, life assurance cover is includedin the endowment policy, so that if a policy holder dies, the sum assured will be paid out which could be used to repay the loan.</p>
			<p>For joint loan applications, both lives can normally be covered.</p>
			<p>And if you move house, you can simply use the endowment policy with your next mortgage.</p><a name="pension"></a><p>PENSION POLICY</p>
			<p>This type of loan is similar to an endowment loan, but you repay it using the cash lump sum available from a personal pension plan. This type of loan is sometimes chosen by either the self employed or those not in a company pension scheme.</p>
			<p>Each month you make your normal loan interest payment to us and a separate payment to the insurance company to cover the personal pension plan. </p>
			<p>The loan balance does not reduce during the term of your loan which must coincide with your retirement date. </p>
			<p>Upon retirement or when the plan matures, you can opt to receive a tax-free lump sum which, if sufficient, could be used to repay the loan.</p><p>In addition, the personal pension plan will also provide a regular income for the rest of your life.</p><p>If a lump sum is taken this would reduce the value of the retirement amount.</p><p>As a pension plan cannot be assigned to us, you will alsoneed to take out a separate life assurance policy to repay your secured loan if you die before you retire.</p><a name="unit"></a>
			<p>UNIT TRUSTS</p>
			<p>Again, each month you make your loan interest payment to us but in this case your separate monthly payment is to the Unit Trust managers.</p>
			<p>Unit Trusts are collective investments used to buy shares or other forms of securities. </p>
			<p>The investments are held by the trustees (often a large bank) and the choice of investments is made by the fund managers. The fund is divided into equal shares (known as "units") and as each person invests into the fund they are allocated the appropriate number of units.</p>
			<p>Your loan can be repaid when you "cash in" your invested units. If the Unit Trust performs well, you may be in a position to repay your loan early.</p>
			<p>As a Unit Trust does not provide life cover, you will need to take out a separate life assurance policy to ensure that your secured loan is repaid if you die.</p><a name="isa"></a><p>INDIVIDUAL SAVINGS ACCOUNT (ISA)</p><p>Each month you make your normal mortgage payment to us and a separate payment to your ISA provider.</p><p>ISAs allow you to earn money from investment in cash, stocks and shares and life insurance. Under current UK tax legislation the returns from an ISA are free from Income Tax and there is no Capital Gains Tax to pay on any increase in the capital value of the investments held.</p>
			<p>Your loan is normally repaid once the value of your ISA equals or exceeds the mortgage debt.
			<p>If your ISA increases in value faster than initially projected, it may be possible to repay your mortgage early. If there are excess monies remaining in your ISA after repayment of your secured loan, these may be taken by you.</p>
			<p>However, if the amount in your ISA is not sufficient to repay the loan at the end of the term you will have to make up the difference.</p>
			<p>As an ISA does not provide life cover, you will need to take out a separate life assurance policy to ensure that your mortgage is repaid if you die.</p><a name="intonly"></a>
			<P>INTEREST ONLY (WITHOUT REPAYMENT VEHICLE)</P>
			<p>This method differs from the previous ways of repaying an interest only loan in that there is no formal agreement about the means by which the loan will eventually be repaid.</p>
			<p>Because of the nature of this type of loan, we only consider interest only loans where the total amount of secured borrowing does not exceed 75% of the value of the property. An additional 30% (Maximum £30,000) of the property's value can be borrowed as an unsecured loan, taking the total borrowing amount to 105%.</p>
			<p>It is important to note that the loan will need to be repaid either upon your death, when the property is sold or at the end of the loan term. Therefore, you will probably wish to have made appropriate financial plans to allow the loan tobe repaid at the end of the loan term.</p>
			<p>As life assurance is not built in to this type of loan, we recommend that you consider the need for this type of insurance protection.</p><a name="part"></a>
			<p>"PART AND PART" LOANS</p><p>These are loans that combine two or more different methods of repaying the loan at the end of the loan term. If you require guidance about the "part and part" combinations acceptable to us, please ask.</p>
			<p>REMEMBER</p><font size=1>
			<p>It must be remembered that the performance of investment related products cannot be guaranteed and that there is a possibility that they will not provide a sufficient return to repay the secured loan in full at the end of the secured loan term.  If such a shortfall should occur, the difference required to repay the secured loan will have to be made up by you from your own resources.</p>
			<p>The value of units in an investment may go down as well as up and is not guaranteed.</p>
			<p>If you have an interest only mortgage, it is your responsibility to ensure an appropriate Investment Product is in place.  If you have an endowment policy, the Association of British Insurers and its members have agreed a Code of Practice to ensure formal reviews of endowment mortgage policies are carried out regularly.  Under the ABI Code insurers will tell you if a shortfall is likely to arise where the life policy was bought with the intention of paying off all or part of the mortgage.</p>
			<p>Once your loan has completed you should not cancel or suspend payments into your chosen  Investment Product without giving consideration to the serious implications that will arise from this.</p>
			<p>The entitlement to payment holidays does not extend to premiums or subsciptions payable towards a repayment product.</p>
			<p>Tax assumptions are based on current legislation which may change in the future.</p>
			<p>The value of tax relief depends on the individual circumstances of the investor.</p><p>You should ensure at all times that your life cover is sufficient to  repay your loan in the event of your death during the term of the loan.</p></font></font></td></tr></table><table width=532 border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10><tr width="532"><td align=left><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size=1><A href="./tog_12.htm">back</a> </font></td><td align=right><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size=1><A href="./tog_14.htm">next</a></font>
