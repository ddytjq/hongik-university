<h1>Andretti excites hometown fans with IndyCar win</h1>

NAZARETH, Pa. -- Michael Andretti did not disappoint his hometown crowd, driving his Lola-Ford to victory in Sunday's 200-lap IndyCar Bosch Spark Plug Grand Prix.<p>
Andretti, who is under probation by IndyCar for rough driving after incidents in the Miami Grand Prix and Long Beach, picked up his first victory of the season and his second career win at Nazareth, having captured the inaugural event in 1987. He finished with an average speed of 140.953 mph as he led the final 113 laps. <p>
Andretti's victory in a Newman-Haas Lola Ford ended a season-opening four-race winning streak by Honda-powered cars. It also halted the perfect start by tire manufacturer Firestone, which lost to Goodyear for the first time.<p>
Andretti won handily over rookie Greg Moore of Canada, whose runner-up finish, 12.213 seconds behind Andretti, was a career best, topping his third-place finish in Australia.  Moore, last year's Indy Lights champion, has led several laps in the series this year. <p>
Al Unser, Jr. was third, 15.043 seconds behind, Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi, a three-time winner at Nazareth was fourth, 15.143 seconds behind. Canadian Paul Tracy, who became the first driver in IndyCar history to record a 190-mile-per-hour lap on a one-mile oval in Saturday's qualifying, was fifth. <p>
&quot;It was just fantastic, what a day,&quot; said Andretti. &quot;We had a feeling it was going to be like this because we ran well all weekend and the car just couldn't be beat.  The guys did a great job. We had a little stall in the pit stops that gave us a scare but we stayed together.&quot; <p>
Tracy was fifth, a lap down. He had a six-second lead about halfway through the race before a botched pit stop allowed Andretti to take the lead. PPG Cup points leader Jimmy Vasser, had the highest-finishing Honda-powered car. He was seventh in his Reynard, behind the Reynard of Bobby Rahal.<p>
On the pit stop, Tracy locked up the brakes, slid through his stall and struck a crewman.<p>
           Left rear tire changer Matt Johnson was struck by the front wing, lifted off ground and thrown ahead several feet. He landed hard on the asphalt, but escaped with a twisted left knee and a scrape to the right one.<p>
           Tracy was forced to leave the pit area as Johnson was lifted over the wall, had to come back in for service and then was forced to pit again for a stop-and-go penalty. By the time he took his car back on the track, Tracy was in sixth place and two laps down.<p>
Rookie Moore took advantage and finished second.<p>
&quot;We're ecstatic&quot; said Moore.  &quot;I don't know what to say.  I'm just so happy. I think we could've caught Mike (Andretti) if we had a few more laps, but this is my best finish this year and I couldn't be any happier.&quot; <p><hr>
