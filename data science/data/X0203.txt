<h1>ARTICLE VII - FREESTYLE</h1>

<p><u>Comment</u>: Freestyle is creative movement with a disc.
Competitive freestyle is a game whereby a player or a team of two
or three players perform a routine, which consists of a series of
throws, catches and moves, done to music using one or more discs.
The routine is compared to the routines of the other competitors
through scoring done by judges, who evaluate the routine on the
basis of <i>difficulty, execution and presentation</i>. The
player or team with the best score is declared the winner.</p>

            <li><a name="701.01"></a>701.01 <u>General</u>: The
                playing area may be of any surface, although
                well-trimmed grass is suggested, which is
                essentially flat, free of obstructions and holes,
                and affords reasonable player safety. The area
                should be approximately 35 m by 35 m in size for
                each pool. Indoor areas are also acceptable if
                they have overhead clearance of at least 6 m. </li>
            <li><a name="701.02"></a>701.02 <u>Spectator Control</u>:
                The entire playing area shall be separated from
                the spectators by lines or rope to insure
                spectator safety and prevent unnecessary
                interference of play. </li>

                or team may use one or more discs which shall be
                WFDF approved as set forth in Article I of these
                rules. If more than one disc is used, the discs
                need not be similar or identical. <ul>
                    <li>A. <i>Disc Alteration:</i> The structure
                        of the disc cannot be altered or changed
                        in any way by a player, subject to the
                        following exception:(1) Application of
                        Lubricant: A player may apply silicone or
                        some other substance to the disc which
                        acts as a lubricant to enhance the
                        performance through the reduction of
                        friction and promotion of the continued
                        movement momentum of the disc. </li>

            <li><a name="702.04"></a>702.04 <u>Aids and Props</u>:
                Players may include various aids or props in
                their routines, only if said aids or props do not
                pose any possibility of danger or harm to any
                players, judges or spectators; are not considered
                to be more than an insubstantial part of the
                routine, and are approved by the tournament
                director, who shall have absolute discretion to
                deny inclusion. <ul>
                    <li>A. <i>Nail Hardener/Fake Fingernails:</i>

                        or her fingernails or toenails or wear
                        fake fingernails for reducing friction
                        and promoting the continued movement of
                        the disc. Fake fingernails may not exceed
                        &quot;normal&quot; fingernail length.
                        Thimbles, guitar picks, or other foreign

    <li><a name="703"></a><b>703 Competition</b> <ul>
            <li><a name="703.01"></a>703.01 <u>Play</u>: Play
                shall consist of a team of players acting in
                concert, exhibiting a routine which is judged for
                score on the basis of presentation, difficulty
                and execution. The routine shall be accompanied
                by music, and shall consist of a series of
                combinations among the participants. <ul>
                    <li>A.<i> Length of the Routine</i>: In the
                        Open, Mixed Pairs and Women's Divisions,
                        the routines shall last 3 minutes in the
                        preliminary round and 4 minutes in the
                        semi-final and final rounds. Co-op
                        routines (three players) shall last 4
                        minutes in the preliminary round and 5
                        minutes in the semi-final and final
                        rounds. </li>
                    <li>B. <i>Music:</i> In the initial round,
                        music shall be supplied by the tournament
                        director and used by both pools
                        simultaneously. In the final round, music
                        shall be provided by the competitors. </li>
                    <li>C. <i>Judging Systems:</i> Two different
                        systems of judging are approved for use.
                        The scored factor system produces more
                        specific numerical values for each of
                        three evaluation factors. Experienced and
                        well-trained judges are required for
                        correct application of this system. The
                        ranked order system also uses the same
                        three evaluation factors but judges are
                        required only to rank the routines after
                        they have evaluated them. Either system
                        can produce acceptable results for all
                        levels of play, however, the ranked order
                        system can be used by players of any
                        experience level with less special
                        preparation. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a name="703.02"></a>703.02 <u>Scored Factor
                System: </u>The Scored Factor System produces
                specific numerical values for each of three
                evaluation factors. Judges are required to know
                how to apply the values for this system. The
                quality of the routine shall be evaluated on
                three factors: presentation, difficulty and
                execution. The routine shall then be scored by a
                panel of nine judges, which shall be divided into
                groups of three. Each group of judges shall be
                assigned one of the three factors, presentation,
                difficulty and execution and shall independently
                rate the quality of a routine in relation to that
                factor. Judges are chosen from available
                non-competing competitors. A non-playing pool
                will be required to judge a playing pool. Each
                pool is assigned a head judge to compile results
                after each routine. Each judge within the group
                shall provide a raw score for the factor assigned
                to his or her group, which shall be added to the
                other judges' scores within the group to obtain a
                factor score. The three factor scores shall then
                be added together to obtain the team's final
                score. <ul>
                    <li>A. <i>Mode of Scoring</i>: Scoring shall
                        be accomplished by the assessment of
                        scores to the tenth of a point.
                        Sub-factors will be used to accumulate a
                        score that falls within the given range. </li>
                    <li>B. <i>Presentation Factor</i>: A routine
                        shall be judged by its presentation
                        factor. Presentation includes two
                        sub-factors: artistic impression and
                        variety. <ul>
                            <li>(1) Artistic Impression: The
                                Artistic Impression sub-factor is
                                scored on a scale of 0.0 - 10.0.
                                Judges award a 0.0 - 10.0 score
                                for each of six sub-categories,
                                then average the sub-category
                                scores to obtain the Artistic

                            <li>(2) Variety: The Variety
                                sub-factor is scored on a scale
                                of 0.0 - 5.0. Variety reflects
                                how well a team mixes the
                                different areas of freestyle disc
                                play. The main goal is for the
                                play to not be repetitious. While
                                a routine should have a proper
                                variety to incorporate the
                                different areas of disc play, by
                                no means does the mix need to be
                                equal. Certain moves may not work
                                toward the ultimate goal of a
                                congruent, appealing routine.
                                Variety requires the judge to
                                focus closely on the play, as
                                repeating the same move with
                                different hands or spins or with
                                an upside down disc is not
                                necessarily tediously repetitive.
                                Similarly, a team playing only
                                clock or counter spin can still
                                score high in Variety. It should
                                also be noted that repetition can
                                be done for artistic purposes.
                                For instance, the purposeful
                                repetition of a move to make a
                                point is not necessarily
                                repetitious. The first
                                performance of the skill (making
                                the point) is demonstrated with
                                the second performance of the
                                move. Judges should think of a
                                routine as a series of ideas and
                                note whether the team presented a
                                series of unique ideas (a high
                                score) or the same idea over and
                                over (a low score). An idea can
                                be a THROW, a CATCH, a DRAMATIC
                                EVENT involving the disc, a DISC
                                HANDLING SKILL, or a CONSECUTIVE
                                PORTION of a combination. The
                                judge should consider the
                                diversity demonstrated in the

                                Judges estimate the difficulty of

                                of 0 to 10. Judges are to
                                consider what is attempted, not
                                what is completed. If a
                                reasonable attempt at a move is
                                made but the disc is dropped, it
                                should receive the same score as
                                if the player had caught the
                                disc. If the attempt falls far
                                short of completion, the
                                difficulty should be reduced.
                                Each of the 3 judges should
                                register a number score between 0
                                and 10 after each 15 seconds of
                                play. A timer or cassette tape
                                should be provided to indicate
                                each 15-second time bloc by
                                sounding &quot;Mark.&quot; The
                                score should reflect both the
                                most difficult moves in the time

                                attempted. For example, a
                                15-second sequence in which the
                                disc is center delayed for 12
                                seconds in front of the face and
                                then culminated with a triple

                                as high a score as a 15-second
                                sequence in which the disc is
                                tipped consecutively ten times in
                                different ways and then
                                culminated with the same triple
                                spinning gitis. A shorter
                                sequence, such as a quick catch,
                                should be given equal difficulty

                                        that affect the flow of

                                        include unintended disc
                                        movement, awkward body
                                        control or breaks in
                                        continuity. A deduction
                                        of .1 should be made for
                                        each Minor Error. </li>
                                    <li>(b) Intermediate Error:
                                        Errors of this degree may
                                        cover drops that the

                                        without the need for a
                                        save or hesitation. Other
                                        pauses like awkward body
                                        movements or disruptions

                                        be considered
                                        intermediate errors. A
                                        deduction of .2 should be
                                        made for each

                                    <li>(c) Major Error: For each

                                        routine the judge should
                                        score a Major Error. It
                                        is also possible that a
                                        drop may not occur, but
                                        the mistake distracted so
                                        much from the flow of the
                                        routine that it deserves
                                        a major error deduction.
                                        Major stalls in action
                                        should receive a mark in
                                        the major error category.
                                        Wild throws may be given
                                        this deduction rather
                                        than the Severe deduction
                                        at the judge's
                                        discretion. Drops that
                                        are &quot;rooted&quot;
                                        out smoothly without a
                                        break in flow can be
                                        reduced to intermediate
                                        or minor errors. A
                                        deduction of .3 should be
                                        made for each Major
                                        Error. </li>
                                    <li>(d) Severe Error: This
                                        deduction is reserved for
                                        mistakes that disturb the
                                        routine in an extreme
                                        way. A wild throwaway or
                                        a clumsy attempt at a
                                        move that falls far short
                                        of completion are both
                                        examples of Severe
                                        Errors. An incident that
                                        endangers the audience
                                        may be considered a
                                        Severe Error at the
                                        judge's discretion. A
                                        deduction of .5 should be
                                        made for each Severe
                                        Error. </li>

                            <li>(2) Tabulation: Each judge scores
                                adds the errors reported, and the
                                deductions are subtracted from
                                10.0. The final score will then
                                be within a range of 0 to 10 to
                                the nearest tenth. </li>

    <li><a name="703.03"></a>703.03 <u>Ranked Order System</u>:
        The factors considered in the Ranked Order System are
        identical to the Scored Factor System except that judges
        need only rank teams on the component to which they are
        assigned. The judging instructions are otherwise
        identical. The routines shall be evaluated by three
        judging panels, each of which is assigned to one of the
        three factors. The panels must be of equal size and have
        at least three judges each but may be as large as is
        justified by the number of available judges. <ul>
            <li>A. <i>Mode of Scoring</i>: Each individual judge
                shall produce a ranked order of the routines
                based on the evaluation of each routine's
                relative quality with respect to the factor of
                evaluation to which the judge has been assigned.
                Overall scoring is a composite of all ranking.
                For example, if six routines are being ranked, a
                first-place rank is worth 1 point, second-place
                is worth 2, continuing down to last place which
                is worth 6 points. The total points for each
                routine are then added together to produce a
                routine's overall score, with lowest score
                winning. Each category is evaluated as it would
                be with the scored system except judges may want
                to determine score in a more subjective manner.
                In the end judges are only responsible for a
                relative rank order of all the teams in a
                particular pool for a given category. </li>
            <li>B. <i>Tie-Breaking Procedure</i>: If teams score
                the identical number of vote points, the tie may
                be broken by determining the team which received
                the largest number of first place votes. If the
                tie remains, move down through the places until
                the tie is resolved. If all places voted are
                identical, the disc flipping method of Article 1
                shall be used. </li>

                touching the ground. </li>
            <li><u>Combination</u>: One complete sequence by a

                move, and catch. </li>
            <li><u>Competitors</u>: Includes a player or group of
                players teaming together. </li>
            <li><u>Co-op</u>: One interactive combination by two
                or more players on a team. A second combination
                or throw within the team constitutes a separate
                co-op for judging purposes. </li>
            <li><u>Delay</u>: The spinning of the disc without
