At the Saffron Walden Herts &amp; Essex Building Society we have been helping people to

first time buyer we provide a traditional and reliable service to help you in this ever
changing market.<br>
<br>
These pages are designed to guide you through the mortgage process - which we will make as
smooth as possible for you - and to answer many of your questions. All our offices have
experienced Branch Managers - you can telephone to make an appointment or call into one of
our offices and receive our sound advice.</font></p>
