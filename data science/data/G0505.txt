              Michael Atiyah, formerly a professor at both Oxford and Cambridge, 
              is one of the foremost mathematicians of the 20th century, and still 
              an important force in the 21st. In the 1960s Atiyah, with Isaac 
              Singer of MIT, proved powerful and far-reaching &quot;index theorems&quot; 
              making profound connections between geometry, topology and algebra 
              relating to the physics of quantum operators in quantum field theory. 
              He has also developed a branch of algebraic geometry called K theory. 
              These advanced mathematical methods, as well as many others he has 
              developed or inspired, have had an immeasurable influence on modern 
              theoretical physics. Atiyah is of Lebanese and Scottish descent 
              and was educated in Cairo and Manchester before entering Trinity 
              College, Cambridge. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society 
              in 1962 and awarded the Fields Medal in 1966. His other prizes, 
              awards and honors are too numerous to mention but are listed <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/Mathematicians/Atiyah.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</i><br>

              <i><b> Sir Michael, what led you to become a mathematician?</b></i><br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10"> Well, I think 
              I was always interested in mathematics when I was a boy, and good 
              at it, I enjoyed it, but there was a time when I <a href="atiyah01.ram"><img src="gifs/earb.gif" alt="Play sound" align="right" width="34" height="43" border="0"></a>wanted 
              to become a chemist. And I oscillated between mathematics and chemistry. 
              But one year advanced chemistry was enough for me. You had to memorize 
              so much stuff. In mathematics all you had to know was a few principles 
              and figure it out yourself. It's so much easier.<br>
              <i><b> Was it organic chemistry that got to you?</b></i> <br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10"> No, it was inorganic. 
              It was how to make sulfuric acid and all that sort of stuff. Lists 
              of facts, just facts, you had to memorize a vast amount of material. 
              Organic chemistry was more interesting, there was a bit of structure 
              to it. But inorganic chemistry was just a mountain of facts in books 
              like this.<br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10"> It's true that 
              in mathematics you don't really need an enormous memory. You can 
              work most things out for yourself, remember a few principles. If 
              you're good at that, then it comes easily. If you want to do other 
              things, you've got to work hard to learn a lot of facts. There was 
              one reason, I think. But I enjoy thinking, I'm good at it, and will 
              continue with it.<br>

              Well, I think if you go back in the past, those in mathematics and 
              physics were called natural philosophers in those days, there wasn't 
              really any difference. Early mathematics all grew out of practical 
              needs and computations, you have tomato fields and you have to do 
              this. Newton's work in calculus was all to work out the dynamics 
              of motion, so there was really no difference. All the great, well 
              most of the great figures of the past were mathematicians or physicists 
              of distinguishment, many of them. Newton, of course. Gauss, and 
              others. Some were of course very much more pure mathematicians by 
              our standards, and some physicists would of course not be very mathematical. 
              But a large number of them worked out the mathematics they needed 
              and mathematics developed out of the needs of the physics to a great 
              extent. Not entirely, but a large part of it, so there's been a 
              long history where it's both. Only in recent times is there this 
              distinction between what's called a mathematician and what's called 
              a scientist. They weren't physicists and chemists in those days, 
              they were natural philosophers, and natural philosophy included 
              mathematics. So it was much more unified.</font></p>

              and what's been happening in recent knowledge with modern developments 
              in theoretical physics is that there's been a need to employ more 
              and more advanced mathematics, so mathematics independently developed 
              for other reasons has been brought into the fold. And so what appeared

              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10"> <a href="atiyah05.ram"><img src="gifs/earb.gif" alt="Play sound" align="right" width="34" height="43" border="0"></a> 
              Well that's very difficult to say. It's really to early to have 
              any kind of final picture. We don't even know what string theory 
              is. But it's had an impact on mathematics which has been really 
              quite extraordinary. First of all, the impact of string theory on 
              mathematics has fairly extensive. It covers many areas of mathematics, 
              not just one. Geometry, topology, and algebraic geometry and group 
              theory, almost anything you want, seems to be thrown into the mixture. 
              And in a way that seems to be very deeply connected with their central 
              content, not just tangential contact, but into the heart of mathematics. 
              And at the same time, the physics ideas have produced ways of thinking 
              and ideas and speculations which go back and produce quite spectacular 
              results and conjectures that mathematicians have been busy working 
              on, which they had no previous way of getting hold of.<br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10"> I would say 
              the biggest impact on mathematics has been as a whole new collection 
              of results and conjectures where you have to deal with, broadly 
              speaking, with what you might call dualities, where the same thing 
              can appear two different guises. In the physics framework these 
              dualities are broadly understood at some conceptual level, even 
              if not technically, and in the mathematics, the dual picture comes 
              out to be totally different. So it's a great challenge for the mathematicians 
              on the ground, to see what we got from the sky, these two things 
              may go together. Working out how that is going to work out in detail 
              is going to be a big challenge for mathematicians. It has transformed 
              and revitalized and revolutionized large parts of mathematics. And 
              so you could say that mathematics in the first half of the 20th 
              century, large parts of it, will be devoted to understanding the 
              impact of string theory on physics and mathematics.<br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10"> One way of looking 
              at it, it's not the only way, but one way of looking at it also 
              is that large parts of physics are concerned with things coming 
              out of quantum field, before we get to string theory. And quantum 
              field theory is about working on infinite-dimensional spaces, infinite-dimensional 
              manifolds, infinite-dimensional groups' function spaces, and doing 
              it in a very detailed way, a lot of detailed calculations and geometry 
              and analysis. And so you could say the mathematics of the earlier 
              century was basically, large parts of it, finite-dimensional. The 
              mathematics of the 21st century will be pretty infinite. Infinite-dimensional 
              stuff in terms of linear theory, Hilbert spaces and that stuff, 
              that will have been done a long time. But nonlinear, all the subtleties 
              and complicated topologies and geometry and so on, nobody did those 
              things at all, barely. Early work on Morse theory and sort of, closed 
              geodesics and so on, were just to scratch the surface. All this 
              new stuff from physics seems to be some overarching attempt to build 
              a big hierarchy of things for infinite-dimensional geometry. And 
              so the 21st century might look like that in the future. In the nineteenth 
              century, all they played around with was N dimensions. In the eighteenth 
              they only played around with three dimensions, then go back to two 
              dimensions and one dimensions.<br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10"> And so you can 
              figure in that way we're leading to a new chapter in mathematics. 
              In its very early days, and its hard to say what it will look like 
              when its finished. But if I had to make a prediction about what 
              people will say about it in the year 2100, then that's what I would 
              say. That the big change was this shift into a totally different 
              frame. And using infinite-dimensional ideas, you get back, of course, 
              results in finite dimensions, that's the miracle.</font></p>

              No I think that I agree with you. Of course it's reassuring for 
              physicists that what they're playing with, even if we can't measured 
              it experimentally, appears to have a very rich, consistent mathematical 
              structure, which not only is consistent but actually opens up new 
              doors and gives new results and so on. They're on to something, 
              obviously. Whether that something is what God's created for the 
              Universe remains to be seen. But if He didn't do it for the Universe, 
              it must have been for something. So it's something worthy of trying 
              to study, there's no question about that..</font></p>

              Isaac Newton, when he became a physicist, he only had to learn first

              Just one slight correction - Isaac Newton didn't have to learn calculus, 
              he had to invent calculus. That's a different story altogether. 
              And I think the norm in mathematics in general, in the history of 
              mathematics, is it builds enormous structures, and we've been doing 
              it now for thousands of years or hundreds of years at least, so 
              you wonder how on Earth we can go on learning and doing more.<br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10">And the reason 
              is of course because mathematics has this great propensity to unify. 
              People find out lots of things, and then at the next stage they 
              say, well all these are special cases of some one simple picture. 
              We abstract out of them all. People object to that business abstracting, 
              they say why don't you stay concrete. Well the whole point about 
              it is if you stay concrete, you're always tied to tables and chairs, 
              you can't see the bigger picture.<br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10"> So mathematicians 
              constantly move up a level. As they go forward, they have all these 
              examples of something, we'll see what's common, and give it a nice 
              title and unify it. And with that under our belts, we can put it 
              in a small textbook and move on.<br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10"> And for century 
              after century, mathematicians have been building this big structure 
              where we absorb what we've done before, put it together in a simple 
              pattern, and I think that not only mathematics but science as a 
              whole, only progresses if you can understand things. It isn't just 
              a matter of, you know, getting a lot of results out of the computer. 
              If science, all it did was to produce a string of numbers, we'd 
              soon be terribly lost. Its aim is to produce ideas and explain things 
              in simple terms. All science is like that.<br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10"> And if it does 
              that, then all the earlier stuff that people... You know, before 
              we understood about the basis of chemistry, they had all sorts of 
              ridiculous stuff. Once they understood about atoms as a whole, it 
              all clicked into place, and most older stuff was forgotten. And 
              the same is true in mathematics. You explore and get through a lot 
              of things, and suddenly you unify everything. So it's this ability 
              of mathematics to unify things what comes before, and simplify it, 
              so that the next generation of students can all say, oh gosh, how 
              easy it all looks. Calculus, I can learn that in six months. And 
              it took a great genius like Newton, and Leibniz, too, their whole 
              lifetimes struggling with it.<br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10"> So we can make 
              progress, otherwise it would be impossible. And it's always surprising. 
              Any one generation.. When I was a student I only had to learn this, 
              and now all the students have to learn this and a lot more, how 
              can they possibly be... and yet you still see them coming along, 
              cheerfully, maybe. In no time at all, they're up to speed and on 
              the front lines. You can see it happening, it's always happening.<br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10"> And the explanation 
              of why it happens is what I've given you. Mathematics and physics 
              and a lot of science aims to unify by simplifying and enabling the 
              next stage to go forward. It's easier in mathematics. Obviously 
              with something in the area of biology, unification isn't as straightforward. 
              DNA unified a lot of stuff, but there's still a lot more complication 
              in biology. But physics is much closer to mathematics, this end 
              of physics, the basic end. There are parts of physics which are 
              also messy and complicated where you don't really unify easily. 
              But the parts related to mathematics are pristine clear and simple. 
              So I think that's always hope yet for the next generation of students.<br>

              to your own work. What led you to develop K theory, which is currently 
              of interest in string theory?</b></i> <br>

              Well I say, it was a big surprise to me to find that it was of interest 
              in string theory. K theory really arose out of algebraic geometry, 
              but basically what it's concerned with is the interrelationship 
              of topology and linear algebra, linear analysis. You study linear 
              things, and you have linear things that depend on parameters, you 
              study how they vary, and the topological implications of that. And 
              K theory is the formal outcome of that.<br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10"> Geometry originally 
              started with linear things. Linear things like curves. If you study 
              tangent spaces to manifolds, they are families of flat things, they 
              are families of vector spaces. So once you get from geometry, immediately 
              you start worrying about things like families of vector spaces, 
              and K theory is the outcome. So large parts of differential geometry 
              and topology have a natural formulation in terms of it. And so K 
              theory was a natural outcome. There were a bit of accidents here 
              and there, so it happened, but you can reasonably speculate that 
              it was inevitable something like this would happen. In many ways 
              it formalizes notions like traces in linear algebra. And of course 
              you've gone to linear analysis, with operators, so it gets up into 
              index theory and so on. So I knew that the physicists would be interested 
              in the analysis side. That would come up, we discovered that twenty 
              years ago.<br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10"> What I'm much 
              more surprised at is they're interested in the more basic topological 
              side, which is, although connected, in some ways independent, and 
              elementary, in some ways, but quite delicate. And some parts of 
              the topology physicists now seem to need is not just only the basic 
              thing which I did a long time ago, but even more refined refinements 
              and variations on the theme which seemed extremely recherch&eacute; 
              at the time, and some of them so recherch&eacute; that we didn't 
              even bother to follow them up.<br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10"> And now the 
              physicists say, we need this, we need this, we need that, and I've 
              got to go back, you know, and see what you can do.<br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10"> But in a general 
              way I believe that if you work in mathematics on fundamental basic 
              central things like continuity and linear analysis and so on, they 
              whatever you do is going to be used in all sorts of places. I was 
              just having lunch the other day with a chap who's an electrical 
              engineer at UCLA and he applies K theory in control theory for robotics. 
              He says it's very important to study the variations of operators. 
              So if you're doing basic things, they are bound to turn up. But 
              it was certainly surprising the way they turned up now, I don't 
              understand it. I've spent two months trying to find out a bit more. 
              It's fascinating. We really don't know quite why it's necessary, 
              why it works, but it seems to be a pragmatic fact of life that K 
              theory is important in string theory, and the more people go along, 
              the more they find out about it.<br>

              expansion of some theory not yet known. People are grappling with 
              it in the dark and they're looking for everything they can get that 
              gives a clue. And I think the way K theory comes in is certainly 
              a bit of a clue. There's lots of places where it comes into string 
              theory at a different level, and since K theory is my background, 
              I like to think about these things and see whether they can possibly 
              suggest what the ultimate picture might look like. And we don't 
              know what that picture is, but it could be the ultimate picture 
              will involve K theory in a some way in a rather central role.<br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10"> It's come in 
              by the back door, and somehow people find it's useful. Why? We don't 
              even quite know. It lurks around the various corners. So I think 
              that if there is an eventual simpler picture that emerges, then 
              I would think that something like K theory, or versions of it, will 
              be an important component. I'd like to think that, it seems rather 
              plausible, but it's very speculative as to what this final theory 
              will look like and how long it will be before it gets there. But 
              I certainly think its happening at the moment. It may not be that 
              far away. In five or ten years we may get a really big insight, 
              some young will come along and open up the doors. And K theory may 
              figure quite interestingly in it.</font></p>

              Well, there are two different things. The main thing that interests 
              me in mathematics always is the interconnection between different 
              parts of mathematics, the fact that one problem may have half a 
              dozen different ways of being looked at in different subjects, a 
              bit of algebra, a bit of geometry, a bit of topology. It's this 
              interaction and bridges that interest me. I'm not that keen on becoming 
              entirely focused on a single area where you forget about everything 
              else and go down with a big bore hole deep down to the middle. I 
              prefer things that unite across the borders. I find that exciting. 
              Occasionally there's some fun in the more lighthearted or frivolous 
              sense. There are some problems which are fun because they're elementary, 
              but strange and difficult to solve to all degrees, unexpected relationships. 
              There's a problem I'm working on at the moment, in what you refer 
              to, is amusing probably in some ways. I don't know what it means 
              or why it's there. It just forces itself on my attention as a problem 
              that is interesting to look at and understand, and fun in some general 
              sense. It may turn out to be I'm peering through a window into some 
              new deep unknown underground treasure, I don't know yet, or maybe 
              that's the window into a rather small piece of scenery. We don't 
              know until we've drawn the veil.<br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10">But I like two 
              things in mathematics - unification, things that unite, unexpectedly, 
              you know. Many beautiful things in mathematics prove something in 
              subject A. By a marvelous and unexpected link a subject way in the 
              corner over there, if you apply this idea then presto, you get to 
              solve those problems, and that's the sort of thing I like. That's 
              one form of unexpected thing. In general, the unexpected.<br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10">If someone is 
              plowing along with a big machine and gradually grinding away and 
              you chug away at the rock face, then that's not very exciting. But 
              if somehow there's a breakthrough and something totally unexpected 
              happens, occasionally. It only happens in mathematics every decade 
              perhaps, something like that happens, like Donaldson's work on four-dimensional 
              manifolds. That was a real spectacular opening, and totally unexpected, 
              out of the blue. And that's really exciting. So I'm really excited 
              by things that are totally unexpected.<br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10">And that's why 
              of course when people ask you what's going to happen in mathematics, 
              the most interesting things are the things you can't predict, by 
              definition. If you can predict it... Predictable things are within 
              your grasp, you can get there. Unpredictable is exciting, and we 
              hope there will be unpredictable things for a long way into the 
              future.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099"><i><b>I 
              think the way a lot of people think about mathematics, since it's 
              all based on logic, it can't be unpredictable. </b></i><br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10"> <a href="atiyah11.ram"><img src="gifs/earb.gif" alt="Play sound" align="right" width="34" height="43" border="0"></a> 
              Well, the idea that mathematics is synonymous with logic is a great 
              ridiculous statement that some people make. Mathematics is very 
              difficult to define, actually, what constitutes mathematics. Logical 
              thinking is a key part of mathematics, but it's by no means the 
              only part. You've got to have a lot of input and material from somewhere, 
              you've got to have ideas coming from physics, concepts from geometry. 
              You've got to have imagination, you're going to use intuition, guesswork, 
              vision, like a creative artist has. In fact, proofs are usually 
              only the last bit of the story, when you come to tie up the... dot 
              the i's and cross the T's. Sometimes the proof is needed to hold 
              the whole thing together like the steel structure of a building, 
              but sometimes you've stopped putting it together, and the proof 
              is just the last little bit of polish on the surface.<br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10">So the most time 
              mathematicians are working, they're concerned with much more than 
              proofs, they're concerned with ideas, understanding why this is 
              true, what leads where, possible links. You play around in your 
              mind with a whole host of ill-defined things.<br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10">And I think that's 
              one thing the field can get wrong when they're being taught to students. 
              They can see a very formal proof, and they can see, this is what 
              mathematics is. My story I can tell. When I was a student I went 
              to some lectures on analysis where people gave some very formal 
              proofs about this being less than epsilon and this is bigger than 
              that. Then I had private supervision from a Russian mathematician 
              called Bessikovich, a good analyst, and he'd draw a little picture 
              and say, this -- this is small, this -- this is very small. Now 
              that's the way an analyst thinks. None of this nonsense about precision. 
              Small, very small. You get an idea what is going on. And then you 
              can work it out afterwards. And people can be misled, if you read 
              books, textbooks or go to lectures, and you see this very formal 
              approach and you think, gosh that's the way I gotta think, and they 
              can be turned off by that because that's not an interesting thing, 
              mathematics, you see. You aren't thinking at that point imaginatively.<br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10">But you mustn't 
              get carried away by the other extreme. You mustn't go all the time 
              with airy-faery ideas that you can't actually write and solve a 
              problem. That's a danger. But you've got to have a balance between 
              being able to be disciplined and solve problems and apply logical 
              thinking when necessary. And at other times you've got to be able 
              to freely float in the atmosphere like a poet and imagine the whole 
              universe of possibilities, and hope that eventually you come down 
              to Earth somewhere else. So it's very exciting to be a practicing 
              mathematician or a physicist. Physicists in principle have to tie 
              themselves down to Earth more than mathematicians, and one day look 
              at experimental data. Well mathematicians have to tie themselves 
              down in other ways too. A proof is one of the things that instantly 
              ties them down. But it's a mistake to think that mathematics and 
              logic are the same. They overlap in important ways, but it's a big 
              mistake. I'm not very good at logic.</font></p>

              Well I suppose the problem I like most of the things I did was a 
              problem I attacked which concerned the thing called an index, the 
              formula for a manifold with a boundary, which ended up by being 
              a formula that connected three different terms, one of which was 
              a topological invariant, one of which was an analytical invariant 
              in terms of eigenvalues of operators, and the third of it was an 
              integral expression involving curvature. So topology, differential 
              geometry and analysis, all written into one simple formula, with 
              a rather nice geometrical interpretation. And I think that was the 
              thing I really most enjoyed doing, traveling across three different 
              borders. It's one that's now used by physicists, that have different 
              meanings, it also has applications in some bits of number theory. 
              It's a very nice example of straddling right across the three different 
              subjects like that.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#000099"><i><b>Do 
              you have a favorite mathematician from before the 20th century?</b></i>

              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10"> <a href="atiyah13.ram"><img src="gifs/earb.gif" alt="Play sound" align="right" width="34" height="43" border="0"></a> 
              Well it's a bit like asking who's your favorite musician. Depending 
              how you feel, one day you can say Beethoven, another day you can 
              say Mozart.<br>
              <i><b>So who would it be today?</b></i><br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10">In mathematics, 
              obviously you have to begin with what the word favorite means. If 
              you're just trying to say who were the greatest mathematicians of 
              all times, you can talk about Newton or you can talk about Gauss, 
              and so on. But if you're trying to use the word favorite in a slightly 
              more personal sense, the person I think I like, well, there are 
              two people that come to mind. One is Riemann. He was a person, first 
              of all, his collected works occupy one volume, unlike Euler, where 
              we talk about thirteen volumes. And in that one volume, he put forward 
              the foundations of modern differential geometry, the Riemann zeta 
              function, an important problem in fluid mechanics. He had a whole 
              range of things which he initiated. And in fact although this was 
              the 19th century, it turned out to determine a large part of the 
              work in the 20th century. He was very far in advance of his times, 
              very deep, original. And being nice and compact in one volume has 
              a kind of appeal, a quality.<br>
              <img src="gifs/dot.gif" align="BOTTOM" hspace="10">The other persona 
              I have a lot of admiration for in a personal way was Walter Hamilton, 
              Walter Rowan Hamilton, who was a mathematical physicist. Hamiltonian 
              mechanics, Hamiltonians, is specific to physics, but he also invented 
              quaternions, which is a great part of mathematics, which I'm very 
              fond of as well. He was an original mathematician in many ways, 
              a slightly difficult character as a person. But I like the unusual. 
              You said before the 20th century, so that rules out the people who 
              overlap the 18th, 19th and 20th century like Poincar&eacute; and 
              so on. For the 19th century I think it has to be Riemann and to 
              a lesser extent, Hamilton.</font></p>
