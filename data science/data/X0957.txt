              note: Our reviewer Mike Raphaeli has indicated that Coach
              Greenberg's video is a bit miss-titled because his 1-3-1 is more
              of an extended 1-3-1 than the commonly played half-court
              1-3-1.&nbsp; Make note of this when considering to adding it to

              <p><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Coach Greenberg’s 1-3-1 extended zone is a bit different
              from a standard 1-3-1 zone, both in its player positions and in
              its actual execution. This defense is probably most effective when
              used tactically and not as the main defense of a team. As Coach
              Greenberg explains, the defense can be used to change the pace of
              a game and it is especially effective when you have a lead

              it can cause the opposing offense to be impatient. He also

              you can see how the other team in planning on attacking it.<o:p>

              <h3><font color="#FF6600" size="1">Changing Positions to Guard the
              Interior</font></h3>
              <p><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The alignment of the players in the 1-3-1 extended zone is
              different than in many other 1-3-1 zones that I have seen. Coach
              Greenberg puts his 2-man at the top of the zone to pressure the
              ball. His reasoning being that his off-guard is a bit bigger than
              his point guard, which makes it easier for him to disrupt the
              passing lanes and he is also athletic enough to stay with the
              opposing point guard when he is bringing the ball up-court. The
              5-man is in the middle of the zone, and his area of coverage is
              either the high-post or low-post, always leaving him within 1 step
              of the paint. The 3 and 4 men are the wings, always mirroring the
              movements of each other – when one is high (the one of the ball
              side) the other is low. Finally, the point guard is the back man
              in the zone. Coach Greenberg is not worried about his smallest
              player playing under the basket, but see the advantage of having
              the opposing team’s big men guarded by a much quicker player. In
              any case, because of the movement in the defense, the 1-man will
              not have to guard an opposing big man with the ball in the low
              post, rather he will front him when he does not have the ball.<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </span></font></p>
              <h3><font size="1" color="#FF6600"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Defensive
              Keys to the Extended 1-3-1</span></font></h3>
              <p><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">There are a few keys to the defense that are emphasized
              repeatedly by Coach Greenberg. The ball must be kept off the high
              post. Initially this is done by the 5 man, who starts by fronting
              the post. When the ball gets passed to the base line and the 5 man
              drops to the low post, the 2-man take over guarding the high post.<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </span></font></p>
              <p><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><img border="0" src="../../../../images/Reviews/the_players_must_be.gif" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">The ball must be kept out of the middle of the floor. The
              2-man, who plays the point guard is primarily responsible for
              this. To start with, he picks up the opposing point guard at ¾
              court and start pushing him to one side. By attacking/bluffing at
              the point guard while he is bring the ball up-court, the 2-man is
              supposed to keep the point guard out of the middle of the floor
              and he continues with this until the point guard has picked up his
              dribble. Then in another unique tactic, rather than pressuring the
              point guard once his dribble is up, the 2-man drops off and gets
              in the guard-to-guard passing lane. <o:p>
              </o:p>
              </span></font></p>
              <p><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">This brings us to the third key point of the defense, that is
              that players must be constantly aware of the passing lane. Coach
              Greenberg explains that <i>the players must constantly check over
              their shoulder to see that they are staying on the passing lane.</i> <b> </b>This
              is probably the most difficult method of off-ball defending,
              because you don’t constantly see the man and the ball like you
              would in a defensive triangle stance and you don’t feel the man
              as you would when you are fronting/overplaying. This is very
              demanding on the wings and 2-man, since they need to constantly be
              turning their heads rather than relying on peripheral vision.<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </span></font></p>
              <p><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The last key is that the ball must be pushed out on all
              guard-to-guard passes. First, if the 2-man is properly positioned
              in the passing lane on the guard-to-guard pass, he will force this
              pass to be a lob pass, which will buy the wing player some time to
              get to the ball. The ball must be attacked and pushed out, so that
              there is no quick pass to either the corner or to the high-post,
              when players must quickly adjust to guard these positions. A
              teaching point that Coach Greenberg repeats all the time is that
              players <i>must move on the air-time of the ball and not follow
              the flight of the ball.</i> By doing this, the wing that needs to
              attack the ball, will be able to reach the guard when the ball
              arrives, rather than waiting for the ball to arrive and then
              closing in on him.<o:p>

              </span>- against a star player in the baseline corner. Otherwise, <i>he
              is against the trap because he feels that it puts too much
              pressure on the wings when the ball is passed out.</i> <img border="0" src="../../../../images/Reviews/dont_use_constant_trapping.gif" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="5"> Usually, he
              has a soft trap in the corner, with one player in a hard press and
              one player in a soft press. When the ball is up top, the wings
              give the hard pressure and the 2-man is in the passing lane. When
              the ball is in the baseline corner, the point guard is putting the
              hard pressure on the baseline and the wings are in a soft press.<o:p>

              <h3><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font color="#FF6600">Comprehensive
              Discussion of Defensive Assignments</font></span></font></h3>
              <p><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Many areas are covered by Coach Greenberg on this tape:
              defending a star player, rebounding assignments, penetration
              adjustments and recovering on skip passes. He repeatedly stresses
              the keys to the defense and is always giving teaching points. In
              addition he explains very precisely how each defender should be
              positioned and each one needs to move on every pass.<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </span></font></p>
              <h3><font color="#FF6600" size="1">Quality Information Needs A
              Better Presentation</font></h3>
              <p><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Although the information presented by Coach Greenberg is very
              good, the quality of the presentation is not. About 2/3 of tape is
              the Coach diagramming the defense on a board and the rest of the
              tape is a slow on-court demonstration without offense. I think
              that showing the movements on both the blackboard and on the court
              is redundant, since either one by itself is enough for a coach to
              understand the defense. The extra time could have been used to
              show the defense in a 5-on-5 situation or to show breakdown drills
              – neither of which are shown on the tape.<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </span></font></p>
              <p><font size="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The 1-3-1 extended zone is an interesting variation of the
              standard 1-3-1 zone. As with all defenses, you need suitable
              players for the defense to be successful. Although I found the
              tape somewhat incomplete, there is enough information on it for
              your team to successfully learn how to execute this defense.<o:p>
