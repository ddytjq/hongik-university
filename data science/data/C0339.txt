        <p><b>Medical conditions</b><br>
          It is very important that this insurance provides adequate cover for 
          your trip. To ensure that it does, and for your peace of mind, you must 
          tell us about anything which could give rise to a claim, particularly 
          where your own health or the health of any person on whom the trip depends 
          is concerned.</p>
        <p><b>Pre-existing medical conditions</b><br>
          Pre-existing medical conditions are not covered unless you have discussed 
          them with us and we have confirmed in writing that you will be covered 
          for them. If you have a medical condition, we will usually refer you 
          to a specialist medical assessment company for an independent medical 
          opinion.</p>
        <p>For all quotations contact our expert staff on 0800 0151512 between 
          8 - 10pm Monday to Friday or 9 - 6pm Saturday and Sunday.<font face="arial" size="2"></font></p>
