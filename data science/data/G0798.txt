<h2>Essay #6: Hints for the Antipode - Other Anomalies</h2>
</center>
 </font> <br>
 </p>
<p> 
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>In this short essay I'll list very briefly a few other examples in deep
space whose behavior   might be explained by the presence of an antipode
at a high red shift (since that possibility is usually ignored).   Remember
that objects will pass through a <em>maximum</em> in luminosity, size, and
velocity as we look toward and beyond an antipode.   So if any discrete objects
have one or more of these characteristics, that might be a pretty good clue
suggesting an antipode.   </p>
<p> <br>
 <font color="navy"> 
<h4>A. Superluminal Velocities</h4>
 </font> </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Observations of many quasars and radio sources over time clearly indicate
that they are expelling matter at speeds <em>faster</em> than the speed of
light (impossible according to the laws of physics).   This phenomenon can
be explained by assuming the jet stream is moving at a very high speed almost
directly toward us, and the too high velocity is a relativistic effect. </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> These "superluminal velocities" are not confined to quasars deep space;
they also occur in the nearer quasars.   The first quasar discovered, 3C
273, is expelling a jet stream faster (apparently) than the speed of light,
and this quasar has red shift of just <strong>.</strong>16. </p>
<p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> Still, the highest superluminal velocities usually occur at the higher
red shifts, up to 30X the speed of light&nbsp; (although I haven't seen any
sort of table that correlates the superluminal velocities to the red shifts
of the quasars). &nbsp; If superluminal velocities occur consistently at
high red shifts, the curvature of space in the vicinity of an antipode would
exaggerate the effect and the <em>highest</em> superluminal velocities will
occur there. </p>
<p> 
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>As an example, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998A%26A...335..145B&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high=341c6d964128041">
this abstract</a> at the Harvard Abstract Service refers to a quasar at z
= 3.1 which seems to have a superluminal velocity of 27 (+/- 17) times the
speed of light.   Although the results are admittedly tentative, this is
<em>precisely</em> the type of phenomena that could happen if an antipode
were close enough to affect any lateral movement.  </p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote> <font color="red"> [Incidentally, note that <a href="App8.html#Soucek">
J. Soucek</a> predicted high superluminal velocities as a result of "fictitious
magnification" in his 1986 article.] </font> </blockquote>

  <h4>B. The "Ultraluminous" IRAS 10214+4724</h4>
 </font> 
  <p> 
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>This is an <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1996ApJ...461...72E&amp;db_key=AST&amp;high=348bf91f3916633">
infrared galaxy</a> at z = 2.286 that was once thought to be about 30,000
times brighter than our own galaxy. &nbsp; The reason it's especially interesting
is because the red shift is in range where the quasar population seemed to
give a initial hint of an antipode near z = 2.2. &nbsp; However, it has since
been shown that part of its brilliance is a result of a gravitational lens
that magnifies the luminosity something like 30 times. &nbsp; So it remains
very bright, but no longer merits the "ultraluminous" tag. </p>
  <p>
<IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Still the "brighter than usual" characteristic is applicable to
this source, even though  it is extremely unlikely that an antipode is in
the lower two-ish range of red shifts. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <blockquote><font color="red"> [My first hunch for the antipode was that
it was the root cause for the unusually high count of quasars out around
z = 2.2.   The quasar table is presented in the next file.   Although it
was a reasonable guess and there was at least one other hint for an antipode
at that red shift, plus this one, it was not verified by the easily predictable
behavior of other classes of objects.]   </font></blockquote>

 <font color="navy"> 
    <h4>C. GRB 971214</h4>
 </font> </p>
    <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> "GRB" is an abbreviation for gamma ray burster, and this one was announced in May, 1998.   At a  red shift of 3.42, it is one of the most luminous objects of its type ever recorded, as bright in the relatively narrow
gamma ray range as a Type II supernova (which, at maximum, is frequently
as luminous as an entire galaxy).   The "ultraluminous" characteristic is
extremely hard to explain, since all previous grbs were at least two magnitudes
fainter. </p>
    <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> You can find a photograph and a summary of the grb <a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap980507.html">
at this site</a>.   And the current best guess of what they are - probably the collapse of very massive stars - is explained <A href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1999A%26AS..138..499W&db_key=AST&high=3bf93a82e109923">in this abstract</A>.
</p>

    <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> There are two things I find interesting<strong>:</strong> (1) the red shift of 3.42 for the grb is in the range where we find the more luminous quasars (discussed in the <a href="qta.html">next  essay</a>) and (2) the
red shift also occurs in the range where we typically don't observe that
much of <em>anything</em>, except "absorbers".   (This curious void is mentioned in Essay #7;  absorbers are discussed in Essay #8).  
<p>
<p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> On the other hand, its <A href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998ApJ...509L...5O&db_key=AST&high=3bf93a82e109923">
host galaxy</A> is neither unusually bright nor unusually
large, which it should be if the galaxy and its grb are near an antipode. 
    </p>
    <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> The GRBs typically occur from z = 2 to 5 (probably the era when the most massive stars were formed) and there is a vague suspicion
among some astronomers that their hard to explain luminosity might have some
cosmological implications. </p>
    <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> The closing question at this site has always intrigued me<strong>
:</strong> "Could the bursts be caused by<strong>...</strong>something as
yet unknown?" </p>
    <p> <IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Perhaps that "unknown" is its proximity <A HREF="App6.html#table">to an unsuspected
antipode</A>, which is why this one appeared so bright.

this abstract</a> refers to an extremely bright quasar at <strong>z = 3.87</strong>
.   The quasar table in Essay #7 shows that the brightest quasars are consistently
in the z = 3 to 4 range. </p>
    <p> <IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>When this quasar was first reported its absolute magnitude was given
as about ten times brighter than any other quasar, with the logical inference
that its absolute magnitude was up around -33 to -34.   It's still the brightest
quasar, but its absolute magnitude is now estimated at -32.2, only about
a magnitude brighter (2.5X) than the runner-up.   (The abstract indicates
that it is amplified about 40X - or four magnitudes - by a few gravitational
lenses, and that's obviously a significant factor in the determination of
its absolute magnitude.) </p>
    <p><IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left> This quasar is the lone entry in the -32 row of absolute magnitudes
at the top of the <a href="qta.html#table">quasar table</a>. </p>
    <p> <IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Notice that the "hyperluminous" quasar at z = 3.87 is not too different
from z = 3.8 for the <a href="antigal.html#bright">brightest galaxy</a> referred
to in the previous file. </p>

      <h4>F. Very Large Hydrogen Clouds</h4>
 </font> </p>
      <p> <IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>Essay #8 discusses the very numerous hydrogen clouds in deep space
commonly called "absorbers".   When seen in front of two adjacent quasars
separated by several arc minutes, they seem uncommonly large.   Now that
the results of two ongoing surveys (2QZ and SDSS) are coming on line which
includes many high red shift quasars, the <em>no-smaller-than-this</em> size
seems to be getting ever larger, as you will see in Essay #8.  <pre>
<hr size="5" width="79%" noshade="">

</pre>
 <IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>So there are some clues in the "larger, brighter, faster" genre which are
the sort of thing that will happen if an antipode is close enough to affect
our observations.   While I'll concede that I'm <em>looking for</em> anomalies
in the z = 3 to 4 range (and may be a victim of selective perception), it
does seem to me that the most unusual observations occur consistently in
this range. </p>
      <p> <IMG SRC=pixelshim.gif width=36 height=7 ALIGN=left>The next files examine two classes of objects very common in deep
space - quasars and "absorbers" - whose distributions are almost certain
to be affected by an antipode, if there is one. </p>
