Granville who at that time was Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, as well
as the Principal of the Iron and Steel works, in Shelton Stoke-on-Trent.</font></p>

commercial depression and embarrassment, recorded that 142 3/4 shares had been
subscribed for and that assets stood at £629. By 1859, the Society reported
flourishing business with assets of £1,136 and by the 25th year in 1879, these
had grown to £4,725. By the turn of the century, membership topped 400 with
assets well over £20,000. A far cry from today's current figure of over £220
million (28/02/99), but already creating a strong influence.</font></td>
