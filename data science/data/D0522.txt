<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">Entering the Warp Core of Java Servlet Technology</SPAN>
<DD>This book is hot, very hot and well worth every single penny you may want to spend on it plus a
    whole hill of beans more. I'm currently the lead Java Servlet developer on a Sun Microsystems
    internal intranet site and amongst our development team this is THE book to use. We also
    recommend it to everyone who asks. So that's the sizzle, where's the sausage? In the last three
    months it's helped us out many times, when we've been between rocks and hard places, I've lost
    count. Amongst many other things it's provided us with a robust, flexible and top notch web
    security system, the ability to generate GIFs on the fly and the easy use of secure HTTP servlet and
    applet tunnelling (Ok, so I didn't REALLY need to write that applet calculator but this book is so
    much fun I couldn't help myself - gotta get out more). With a mixture of solid blocks of clear text
    to explain things and solid blocks of production-strength code to "develop" from (which always
    work first time when you "adapt" them), this book is a serious winner and should be top of
    anyone's list of "Java Servlet books I must buy". There's an awful lot packed into these 500 plus
    pages, way beyond the "Core" that the title suggests and IMHO this is clearly the best Java book
    Sun Microsystems Press has ever produced (BTW I'm a contractor and not part of the Sun
    share-option scheme :-) [...] Top work! 8-)
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">This is It!</SPAN>
<DD>I'm still a java/jsp newbie. I invested a significant amount of money in several books on the topic.
    As I read, learn and grow - this one particular book has become my java bible. It is written in a
    clear, concise format. The structure of the chapters is logical and progressive for a beginner.
    Forget the rest - buy the best - and this is the book.
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">Thanks for Writing the Book</SPAN>
<DD>The book you choose can determine your success as a Java Developer. I found "Core Servlets and
    JavaServer Pages" to be the cornerstone book to launch my career as a Java Developer.
    Other books by publishers like Wrox use a dozen or so authors to cover complex subjects such as
    server side programming. Sometimes this breeds confusion and an inconsistent writing style that's
    hard to follow. The difference between a good book and a great book is the number of authors,
    level of skill and ability to teach. Marty Hall teaches Java for a living and has mastered the Java
    language and the skill of teaching. He obviously has encountered many question from thousands
    of students and orchestrated his book toward learning. The last time I checked, Amazon had this
    book as the number one seller among Java books. Need I say more? Get the book.
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">Your search for a JSP book ends here</SPAN>
<DD>This is such a great book, that its difficult to speak highly enough of it. Not only is it a great book
    for the subject area that it covers - it also should be used as a textbook for other editors, writers
    and publishing houses on how to put together a good technology book. The main advantages are
    that it excludes all superfluous background/marketing lingo. This means that the book is useful
    and relevant from the first page - rather than the 3rd chapter [...]
    You will find the
    content loaded with insights, pointers to be aware about, and a natural flair for good teaching.
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">Core Servlets sets itself apart from other JSP books</SPAN>
<DD>This book is truly a good buy. If you are new to JSP and servlets then I would definitely
    recommend this book. Before I bought this book I purchased professional JSP by wrox press and
    it was badly written and its explinations were unclear. Plus the number of spelling mistakes in that
    book were rediculous, making the book untrustworthy. Marty Halls's book is organized well and
    clearly explains the technology so that anyone can understand it. It is also advanced enough to be
    used as a good reference. If you have ever had trouble staying awake while reading a programming
    book, don't worry, Core Servlets is actually written well enough to keep you interested and awake.
    So I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in JSP or Servlets. It is also easy to skip
    around the chapters if you want to read up on something specific. It tells you in the chapters if it is
    discussing something from another chapter, which can be very helpful if you don't understand that
    topic or if you have not read the other chapter yet. He also has a nice web page with notes on JSP
    and all sample code in an easily downloadable format.
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">Best book for servlets and jsp</SPAN>
<DD>Marty Hall's book ( Core Servlets and JavaServer Pages ) got me up and running with servlets and
    jsp in a very short time. It gives many excellent real world examples and is written in an intelligent
    and straight forward manner. It is not too much to say that its the best book I've ever read with
    regards to a technology I am interested in.
    <BR><BR>
    Definitely the one to get if you're into servlets and jsp.
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">Simple outstanding coverage of this exciting technology</SPAN>
<DD>To anybody who wants to learn more about Servlets and JSP, this is the absolute standard
    reference, in my view. It´s a pleasure to read, easy to understand, lots of examples and worth every
    dollar you invest. I did not find a book which covers Servlets and JSP better in detail.
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">The Author speaks to you!</SPAN>
<DD>This Java book is not one of those dead, dull and boring computer programmming books that you
    have to use in college. He has a way with his pen that brings the java code to life! I think this book
    is the way to go with servlets and jsp programming. I would recommend this book over many
    others I've seen out there. This book you won't just read you'll Enjoy it!
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">Great coverage of all that is JSP and Servlets!</SPAN>
<DD>From start to finish a great book. I was very pleased with the coverage from the basics of
    describing the technology to very extensive code examples. Each topic was covered in exhaustive
    detail. I judge a technology book based on how easily a technical subject can be understood and
    how well the coding examples apply to help learn the concepts. This book rates 5 stars in both
    regards!
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">The best book on Servlets/JSP seen so far</SPAN>
<DD>I was hunting all over the net for a book which could clearly explain in the best possible ways the
    concepts of Servlets/JSP's. Many articles were available but not very convincing ones. But this
    book by Marty Hall is really worthy of all praises. It was just the kind of book I was looking for. It
    explains the concepts in a very smooth way covering the required basics and taking the reader to
    advanced topic level. I could never have asked for a better book than this. It was like a "Stop here,
    Look no further" for information of Servlets/JSP. This is no doubt a "Must buy" [...]
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">Excellent Book</SPAN>
<DD>This was the book we chose for our in-house training class, so our entire team of software
    engineers received a copy. Most were new to these particular technologies, but a few had a fairly
    good background in the subject. The unanimous opinion of the group was that the book is
    excellent. Not only is it well-written, but it has few, if any, mistakes. We've not found any typos,
    grammatical errors, syntactical or other types of code errors in this book. The content is extremely
    useful in a real-world context, and we have already begun putting the information from the book
    to use in our applications. This book was obviously written by someone who has worked
    extensively with these technologies.
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">Absolutely Excellent</SPAN>
<DD>I am a student at Kings College London studying Computer Science. I found this book very
    concise and easy to follow. Everything in the book was relevant, and all examples ran without a
    hitch with the exception of the online travel one, about which I emailed the author and received a
    very timely reply! Same day in fact! Unbelievable. I would recommend this book to anyone as it has
    both depth and practicality without detailing irrelevant historical facts about how technology has
    evolved etc etc. This book will get you programming excellent JSPs and Servlets quickly and
    easily! What more could you ask for!
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">Solid Book, Concise and error Free</SPAN>
<DD>In summary, a great book. I have struggled with many books that got lost in 1 complex
    example so you could not get your hands on reference material. Other books give perfunctory
    explanations that have no practical meaning. Still others are so full of mistakes, you realize they
    were thrown together. NOT THIS BOOK. Concise reference material, good small usable
    examples that support the material, and the book has been error-free for me so far. You can go
    into greater depth after you absorb this book. However, you will always refer back to this book
    because it is readable and clear. Finally, good direction on how to get these running on you home
    machine for practice. In short, get it and try the examples and start experiencing JAVA on the web
    server!
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">Best combination of JSP &amp; Servlet reference</SPAN>
<DD>It's quite difficult to find a good book about servlets. Even more difficult when it comes to JSPs.
    This book covers both topics in an extremely practical and logical way. It gives solutions to
    real-world problems and many of the code samples can be used for your own application
    development. One of the strong points of this book is explaining the implications of various
    HTTP rechniques that can be used in combination to servlet programming. Tunelling is of
    extremely importance in overcoming the limitations of the firewalls. Overall I consider the best
    book for both newcomer/advanced JSP/Servlet programmer.
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">Clear explanation of servlets and jsp technologies</SPAN>
<DD>This is the book to read to have very clear and concise explanation of how to set up whole
    servlet/jsp environment to begin to develop your own servlets and jsp pages. Then Marty will take
    you on a tour on how to implement and think about implementing useful servlets explaining what's
    behind the technology you use. This is a very practical and useful book for anyone who wants to
    jump into the world of server-side java technologies and quickly become a proficient in the field.
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">Core Servlets and JavaServer Pages was great</SPAN>
<DD>This was a very informative, organized and well written book. It left no questions concerning
    servlets and JSP unanswered. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in learning
    these skills.
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">Excellent introduction and good HTTP discussion</SPAN>
<DD>This is a great book if you'd like to get going with JSP/Servlets. Especially useful are the bits
    about HTTP headers, response codes, things like that, which really get you into the heart of the
    HTTP protocol and using servlets to actually extend the power of the server, not just generate
    dynamic documents. Also, very cool display of servlet power by creating dynamic Excel
    spreadsheets--a good example of how you can use servlets to build a server to serve just about
    anything. [...]
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">Great Book</SPAN>
<DD>I was able to go from to zero to "up-to-speed" on servlet programing with this book. Well written.
    Never had any servlet programming experience before. You will get your value for this book, and
    you will UNDERSTAND what the servlet is doing. Pretty cool.
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">Core Servlets/JSP -- exactly what it says</SPAN>
<DD>Excellent reference guide for JSP and servlet information. The author has a knack for explaining
    things in ways that programmers understand not only the how but also the why. This is not a text
    for beginners, but instead hits its target dead on -- somewhat experienced java developers moving
    from enterprise applications to web-apps. [...]
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">Great Reference</SPAN>
<DD>I have used this book as a resource for a course I am taking. It has served as an excellent reference.
    Easy to find things. This book contains an incredible amount of information written in an easy to
    use logical format. Interspersed comics and humorous examples give it alot of "light relief".
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">Exceptionally good book</SPAN>
<DD>I was at first reluctant to post this review because I didn't want to let the secret out. But to be fair,
    I must say this is the best book on servlets I have seen. It has a great section on http headers that I
    have not seen so well documented anywhere else. I have one copy and I plan to buy more for my
    colleagues, since it's usually out on loan when I need it the most.
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">Great Book for JSP and Servlets</SPAN>
<DD>Great book Marty. I used this book to write JSP pages for my company's client server application,
    which uses Weblogic server. This book starts with the basic concept, like where to place files once
    you write your code (most of the authors omit this info) and other basic details of customizing
    your web server and covers all the advance topics you ever need. I used other books like
    Professional Java Server Programming and wasted three days and with Marty's book I was able to
    finish everything within two days.
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">The Best Servlet and JavaServerPage Book!</SPAN>
<DD>Mr. Hall's book is a comprehensive explanation of servlet and JSP technologies. It starts with the
    basics concepts and walks the reader all the way through to the more difficult concepts. Mr. Hall's
    writing style keeps the "heavy" stuff light. I have moderate Java experience and I'm a server-side
    Java neophite. Mr. Hall's book had me going in no time and I'm now creating an enterprise web
    application to interface with a legacy database.
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">Excellent Book!</SPAN>
<DD>I agree with the other 5 star reviews. This is an excellent book! The material is well organized, the
    sequence of topics is appropriate and easy to follow. Examples are clear and useful. The author
    has a knack for explaining the essence of the technology and then presenting details in examples
    that further develop his ideas. Be sure to visit the author's companion web site -- not only to
    download all of the coding examples -- but also to obtain the latest instructions for installing
    Tomcat and other software packages.
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">An awesome book on servlets and JSPs</SPAN>
<DD>This is one awesome book on servlets and JSPs. Honestly, I didn't have any prior experience or
    knowledge in Java, but entering the world of Java through servlets and JSPs is actually refreshing.
    This book really helped me alot, and it's definitely a great buy. It's really worthy to be in my
    computer books collection.
<DT><SPAN CLASS="MEDIUM">One of the best!</SPAN>
<DD>I have read 4 different Servlet and JSP books. I was looking for a good book teaching
    JSP/Servlets. This book is clearly the best. A very interesting format, to the point and clear
    examples. No chapters on Java History, Why Java is the best lang and useless information like
    that. If you know how to program in Java and want to get in to Server side programming. This
    book is all you need.
