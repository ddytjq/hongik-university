    ago, before the Voyager probes visited Jupiter, if you had described
    Io to a literary critic it would have been declared overwrought
    science fiction. Jupiter's strange moon is literally bursting
    with volcanoes. Dozens of active vents pepper the landscape which
    also includes gigantic frosty plains, towering mountains and
    volcanic rings the size of California. The volcanoes themselves
    are the hottest spots in the solar system with temperatures exceeding
    1800 K (1527 C). The plumes which rise 300 km into space are
    so large they can be seen from Earth by the Hubble Space Telescope.
    Confounding common sense, these high-rising ejecta seem to be
    made up of, not blisteringly hot lava, but frozen sulfur dioxide.
    And to top it all off, Io bears a striking resemblance to a pepperoni
    pizza. Simply unbelievable. <BR>

    </TABLE>Since the first volcanic plume was discovered by Voyager
    in 1979, Io has remained under intense scrutiny. Astronomers
    using ground-based telescopes can monitor large volcanic eruptions
    from Earth by recording outbursts of infrared emission. Such
    measurements combined with Voyager and Galileo data show that
    some volcanoes on Io have been active for at least 20 years.
<BR>
<BR>
    For a world dominated by fiery volcanoes, it's curious that Io
    is also very, very cold. The ground just around the volcanic
    vents is literally sizzling, but most of Io's surface is 150
    degrees or more below 0 C. The moon's negligible atmosphere traps
    little of the meager heat from the distant Sun. As soon as volcanic
    gases spew into the air they immediately begin to freeze and
    condense. The plumes of Io's sizzling volcanoes are very likely
    made up of sulfur dioxide snow. <BR>

    dioxide frost appear in white and gray hues while yellowish and
    brownish hues are probably due to other sulfurous materials.
    Sulfur dioxide is normally a gas at room temperatures, but it
    exists on Io's surface as a frost after condensing there from
    the hot gases emanating from the Io volcanoes. Bright red materials
    (such as the prominent ring surrounding the currently erupting

    &quot;Io has lots of thermal areas just like Yellowstone,&quot;

    the attention but there are probably also things like fumeroles
    and geysers. On a previous flyby the Particles and Fields instruments
    saw a deficit of energetic particles over Io where gas was probably
    coming out of the surface -- but no plumes were seen. We call
    this the 'stealth plume hypothesis.' The closest Earthly analog
    to what's happening would be a water geyser like Old Faithful.

    <!--/NOEDIT--> The intense volcanism on Io results from 100
    meter high tides raised in its otherwise solid surface by nearby
    Jupiter and the other Galilean satellites. Although this process
    is fairly well understood, many aspects of Io's forbidding environment
    remains a mystery. What makes the lava around the volcanic vents
    so incredibly hot? What are the plumes made of? What causes the
    many colors of Io's mottled surface? Scientists hope that these
    and many other questions will finally have answers after Galileo
    makes two daring passes less than 620 km above Io on October
    11 and November 25, 1999. In November Galileo might even pass
    through the plume of Pillan Patera, making it the first spacecraft
    ever to fly through an alien volcano. <BR>
<BR>
    &quot;For the October flyby we'll be targeting four major volcanoes,&quot;
    says JPL's Duane Bindschadler, the manager of Galileo's Science
    Planning and Operations Team, &quot;Pillan Patera, Prometheus
    (the most prominent one on the surface), Loki, and Pele. The
    pictures will be great. To put this in perspective, the very
    best images from Voyager had 500 m resolution. We'll be getting
    over 100 images at least that good, and the best images will
    show details only 7 <I>meters</I> across.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
    &quot;But we won't just be running the camera,&quot; he continued.
    &quot;Just about every instrument on the spacecraft will be turned
    on during the flyby. The most important ones for volcano science
    are probably the solid state imaging camera (<A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/instruments/ssi.html">SSI</A>),
    the near infrared spectrometer (<A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/instruments/nims.html">NIMS</A>)
    and the photopolarimeter-radiometer (<A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/instruments/ppr.html">PPR</A>).&quot;
<BR>

    SRC="images/galileo/hotspots.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="2" hspace="10"
    vspace="10" width="228" height="211"></A> Each of these instruments does something different.
    NIMS spectra can be used to deduce the composition of plumes,
    flows and other surface features. The PPR measures the polarization
    and intensity of sunlight and thermal radiation. This helps scientists
    understand what atmospheric and volcanic gases are made of and
    how things are heated. The SSI camera takes high resolution pictures
    in optical light. Each of the three can also be used like a thermometer
    to measure the temperature of features on Io. The NIMS and PPR
    instruments are better at reading the temperature of cool material
    like plumes and ground frost. Around hots spots warmer than 700
    K, where the NIMS and PPR detectors saturate, the SSI camera
    can be used to estimate temperature. By using the SSI, NIMS and
    PPR together scientists hope to get a more complete picture of
    Io's volcanic activity. <BR>

    image indicate the locations of volcanic vents on Io, which are
    spewing hot lava. This image and other data from NASA's Galileo
    spacecraft indicate that the lava at Pillan Patera (marked Pillan)
    exceeded 1,700 degrees kelvin (2,600 degrees Fahrenheit) and
    may have reached 2,000 degrees kelvin (3,140 degrees Fahrenheit).
    The hottest eruptions on Earth today reach temperatures of about
    1,500 kelvin (2,240 degrees Fahrenheit), but hotter lava erupted
    billions of years ago. [<A HREF="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/PIAGenCatalogPage.pl?PIA01635">more

<BR>
    &quot;The biggest mystery about Io's volcanoes is why they're
    so hot,&quot; says Bill Smythe, a co-investigator on JPL's NIMS
    team. &quot;At 1800 K, the vents are about 1/3 the temperature
    of the surface of the sun! Billions of years ago basaltic lava
    on Earth was about that hot, but now -- thanks to mixing in subduction
    zones -- terrestrial basalts have a lower melting point. Lavas
    we see now on Earth are about 300 K cooler than they used to
    be. It's very surprising to see lava flows on Io as hot as these
    ancient flows on Earth. Why? Simply because Io's soil has been
    reworked many, many times, so the melting temperature should
    be lower for the same reason that Earth's basalts melt at a lower
    temperature. It's a real mystery.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
    &quot;Originally we thought all the lava flows were sulfurous,
    but sulfur vaporizes at ~700K. The 1800 K regions have to be
    basaltic. Now the questions is 'are <I>any</I> of the lava flows
    sulfurous?' Galileo has detected areas on Io with temperatures
    between 300 and 600 K. That's about right for molten sulfur.
    But those could also be places where tiny volcanic vents at ~1800
    K are surrounded by cold ground. From a distance the average
    temperature would appear to be 300 - 600 K. We need higher resolution
    data to figure out what's going on. If we're lucky Galileo will
    fly right over one of these spots in October and we'll have the
    answer.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
    Understanding the balance between sulfur and silicate (basaltic)
    volcanism is important for scientists who are trying to understand
    how Io's interior is heated. Sulfur has a lower melting point
    so it doesn't need as much energy to make lava. The basaltic
    flows require much more internal heat. <BR>

    &quot;Another thing we'll be going for with these close-up flybys
    are high resolution pictures of the lava flows,&quot; continued
    Smythe. &quot;We really want to know what the shapes and edges
    of the flows look like because that can tell us a lot about the
    properties of the lava. On Earth lava flows form little side
    lobes, or extrusions that look like arms, feet and toes. They
    range in size from a few centimeters to meters. From experiments
    on Earth, we know how to estimate the viscosity of the lava and
    other material properties from the shapes and sizes of the toes.
    That's what we want to do on Io, but the best resolution we have
    now is 1 km. At closest approach we'll have resolutions of only
    7 meters. When we start seeing how the toes form we'll know what
    kind of flows these are.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
    Some of the most exciting results from the upcoming flybys will
    result from great improvements in resolution. For example, the
    best resolution of previous NIMS data is only 60 km. <BR>
<BR>
    &quot;You can hide a lot in 60 km,&quot; points out Smythe. &quot;During
    the closest flybys NIMS will see things just a few hundred meters
    across. That'll be a first.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
    &quot;Another thing we're hoping to get in October is a plume
    seen in profile as the spacecraft passes by Io and looks back
    over the limb,&quot; continues Smythe. &quot;By looking at the
    polarization of sunlight passing through the plume with the PPR,
    we ought to get some really valuable information about the temperature
    and density of particles coming out of the vents.&quot;</P>

    <H3>Digital Io</H3>

    <P>Here on Earth scientists will be eagerly awaiting the new
    data. For instance, at the University of Texas, Dr. David Goldstein
    and graduate students J. Victor Austin and Ju Zhang, following
    the pioneering work of Sue Keefer, have been working for years
    on computer simulations of Io's volcanic plumes. Using a technique
    called Monte Carlo direct simulation, they send computerized
    test particles blasting out of a model volcanic vent. The University
    of Texas program tracks the motion of ejected molecules taking
    into account intermolecular collisions, energy input from the
    Io torus, and energy lost to infrared radiation. By varying the
    size of the vent, the temperature and velocity of the ejected
    gas, and the temperature of the surrounding terrain they can
    match the appearance of their computerized plumes with the ones
    photographed by NASA space probes. Sometimes this leads to new
    insights about the fluid dynamics and physics of Io's volcanoes.
<BR>
<BR>
    &quot;The upcoming flybys could substantially improve our models
    by providing better boundary conditions,&quot; says Goldstein.
    &quot;We need to know lots of things. What are the particle velocities
    and temperatures coming out of the volcanic vents? How do the
    molecules interact with the surface? Do they stick immediately
    or do they bounce? etc...&quot; <BR>
<BR>
    &quot;Right now when we look at a photograph of a plume, we really
    are not certain what we're seeing. It might be gas, it might
    be dust entrained in the gas, or gas that has condensed out to
    form ice crystals. We assume that whatever it is traces volcanic
    gas but we can't be sure. Hopefully the flybys will resolve some
    of these issues.&quot; <BR>

    vspace="10" width="293" height="226"></A>In one of the University of Texas sample models,
    pictured right, gas erupts from a vent at 2.7 times the velocity
    of sound into Io's tenuous atmosphere. The ejecta soar to a height
    of about 120 km. Much of the material lands about 150 km away
    where it hits the ground and bounces. Just before it hits the
    surface, the gas passes through a shock wave and heats up to
    200 - 300 K. <BR>

    animation. Colors in this picture represent gas temperature.
    Red is warm and blue is cooler. The gas in this model starts
    out at 200+ K near the vent. It cools as it rises and expands,
    then heats up again as it passes through the canopy shock. An
    important feature can be seen about 150 km from the vent where
    falling gas strikes the ground. The gaseous ejecta heats up and
    possibly scours away the sulfurous surface frost, exposing dirt
    and rock underneath. [<A HREF="http://www.ae.utexas.edu/~victor/research/">more
    information</A>]</FONT><BR>
<BR>
    &quot;One of the most important features of this model is the
    canopy shock,&quot; points out Victor Austin. &quot;It's where
    the gas rises to its apex and then falls back on itself. One
    way to think of the shock is to imagine a running water hose
    held straight up in the air. The water decelerates due to gravity
    and then comes back down. The same thing happens to a volcanic
    plume. It rises into the atmosphere and then gravity pulls it
    back. On Io the rising gaseous 'fluid' is supersonic so it forms
    a shock near the turnaround point.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
    &quot;This is where the Io flybys might confirm some of our results.
    Gas cools very quickly after it passes through the shock, so
    it's possible that a layer of SO<sub><FONT SIZE="-1">2</FONT></sub>
    snow will form in the postshock region. Vertically the shock
    is very thin, so the layer of ice crystals is probably going
    to be thin, too. That's something we might see in the high resolution
    Galileo images.&quot; <BR>
<BR>

    SRC="images/galileo/volcanicrings.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="1"
    hspace="10" vspace="10" width="0" height="0"></A> &quot;Another thing,&quot; said
    Goldstein, &quot;many of our simulations show that warm material
    from the plume crashes down about 150 km from the vent. We think
    this might explain the dark rings we see in some of the spacecraft
    images (see left). These could be 'scouring rings' -- places
    where the SO<sub>2</sub> frost is worn down to dirt and rock.
    Victor's calculations show that these rings themselves are wide
    but the edges are sharp. If we can see those edges in the close-up
    photos, it would help confirm our results. Some of the models
    also show a secondary scouring ring much further from the vent.
    We'll be looking for those in the new images, too. Scouring is
    one possibility, but the dark coloration may also simply be due
    to deposition of a different colored material coming out of the
    vent.&quot; <BR>
