* The Cashback represents 2% of the advance, up to a maximum of £2,500. APR 5.6%
variable; rate correct as at 1 December 2001. <font color="#FF0000">Typical example:</font>
a repayment mortgage of £50,000 over a period of 25 years on a property valued at
£70,000. The gross monthly payments for the first 24 months will be £273.81 and 276
months at £310.62. The APR, the monthly payments and the total amount payable have been
calculated on the assumption that the variable mortgage rate will remain constant
throughout the term of the mortgage. At the end of the two year discount period the
Society&#146;s variable mortgage rate then applicable will apply. The total amount payable
will be £92,642.06 which includes: valuation fee of £155 (paid to an external valuer),
an application fee of £20, estimated legal fees of £164.50, completion fee of £25 and a
redemption fee of £40. If the amount borrowed exceeds 75% of the property purchase price
or valuation (whichever is lower) a Mortgage Indemnity Guarantee fee is payable. Full
written quotations are available on request. Security in the form of a legal mortgage over
the property will be required. Mortgages are only available to persons over the age of 18
and are subject to status. </a></p>
