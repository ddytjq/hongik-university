<h1>Easy Offensive Plays</h1>

<p>Notice: This article was written by Steve Jordan, <a href="http://www.akcoach.com">Coach's
Notebook. </a>Email the author at <a href="mailto:sjordan@alaskalife.net.">sjordan@alaskalife.net.</a></p>

<p><span id="item1a">What is the most common weakness in basketball teams of all ages?
Easy - it is the half court offensive game. Most young teams never really get the hang of
it because of the time and discipline required to learn to work effectively at this team
skill. It is far easier to teach a team to be disruptive with their defense and score off
transition. When that happens, offense is a matter of making lay-ups or open jumpers. </p>

<p>The secret of winning at basketball usually boils down to this: 

<ol>
  <li>Have the best full court press, if not...</li>
  <li>Be able to break a press consistently and have at least a moderately successful half
    court offense.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you can break your opponent's press and thereby minimize your turnovers, then you
have very likely taken the opponent's offense away from them. (see <a href="pressbreaker.htm">pressbreakers</a>). Teams accustomed to running up high scores
will often lose their confidence once they realize there will be few easy baskets. They
will make poor decisions trying to keep up their normal scoring pace. It becomes
embarrassing and frustrating for them to try and run plays in an uncomfortable
environment, such as the halfcourt game is to a team that has not learned to take
advantage of it.</p>

<p>So, if you have prepared some simple offensive routines that your players are
comfortable running, that have a relatively quick shot payoff, and return the players to
positions that allow the play to be initiated again without a significant reset, you may
well have the upper hand at the halfcourt offense.</p>

<p>There are some plays diagrammed below that are easy to teach and learn. I advocate
simplicity above all in choosing a half court offensive set. Why? Several reasons: 

<ol>
  <li>Learning complicated patterns will consume a huge chunk of precious practice time.</li>
  <li>Inexperienced players will have trouble concentrating on patterns during the game.</li>
  <li>Complex plays break down easily. Sometimes one mistake by one player can throw the
    entire team into confusion or disarray.</li>
  <li>If the offensive play is too difficult, the kids will just stop trying to run it.</li>
  <li>When trying to run a complex pattern, the kids work so hard at following the play, they
    miss the open shots that are created during the process.</li>
</ol>

<p>Basketball is a very dynamic game. In a fast paced game, the spontaneous <a href="fundoffplays.htm">fundamental plays</a> create the most points. A quick give and go,
pick and roll or backdoor are exploitive plays that should be used spontaneously when the
opportunities are there. Once the defense is set, call a pattern, be patient, and take
advantage of - not the first shot, necessarily - but the first high-quality shot. It makes
no sense to waste a valuable possession on a cheap shot.</p>

<h2>Alaska Play</h2>
<p>This set is a different way of
running plays. Typically, players are directed from point A to B to C. Sometimes
the process is simple, sometimes complex. A common problem with a structured
process is that the players get too involved in the method and do not recognize
all the shot openings that are created along the way. Another problem is that it
takes a while for a team to memorize patterns and sequences and then perform
them under game pressure.</p>
<p>The Alaska Play is built on a few simple rules. It doesn't matter who has the
ball or where the ball is. The ball handler's action dictates what everyone will
do next. This provides a series of simple, basic plays. The offense will know
exactly what to expect when the ballhandler passes the ball. An observer,
thinking in more linear terms, will believe they are watching a complex process
at work. A big advantage is that offensive players must take action following a
pass, not just stand around and wait for the ball to come back to them.</p>
<p><b>Starting Setup:</b> There are three perimeter players and two post
players. The perimeter players maintain a balanced position near the three point
line. One post player plays high, near the free throw line, and the other stays
low, on the opposite side of the key from the high post. An important point is
that the high post always lines up so that there is a straight line from the
ball, through the high post, to the basket. The high post player maintains that
alignment as the ball is rotated around the perimeter. The low post stays near
the baseline, following the ball from side to side.</p>
<p><b>Look below for additional explanations generated by emailed questions from
other coaches.</b></p>
<p><b>Here are the rules:</b></p>
<p>1. If you pass to a wing, you pick away. So when the point passes right, he
picks to his left. That pick allows the left wing to make a cut to the basket or
to the ball.</p>
<p>2. If you pass to a post, cut to the basket. If you don't get the ball, go to
the weak side wing spot. The perimeter players adjust to make room.</p>
<p>3. If you pass to the point, reset. Keep spacing balanced.</p>
<p>4. If the perimeter player doesn't pass, that's the signal for the high post
to come out little and run a pick and roll.</p>
<p>Notes: Perimeter players and post players don't switch places. If a post
passes to a wing, he picks away, but he picks for the other post player (its his
only choice). If a post passes to a post, he cuts to the basket then returns to
his position on the other side of the key. That way, balance is maintained.
Following are examples of what can happen.</p>

        little help on the way to the basket. Not getting the ball, #3 continues
        to the weak side wing. 1 and 2 have adjusted to make room.</td>

      <td valign="top">Player 5 elects not to pass to 3 or to shoot.
        Instead he passes to a wing (player 2) which dictates that 5 picks away.
        The only person he can pick for is the other post, so he does so. There
        is a large open area near the basket. 4 hopes to get the ball there.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="135" align="center"><img src="images/ak4.gif" alt="Ak4.gif (1166 bytes)" width="123" height="118"></td>
      <td valign="top">Player 4 doesn't get the ball. Darn. So
        Player 2 hits the new high post, Player #5, and because #2 passed to a
        post, #2 cuts to the basket. Notice the nice path created to the basket.
        If 5 doesn't hand off to 2, he'll probably pass out to 1 who should be
        shifting in to the vacated wing position. Because 5 passes to a wing
        he... you guessed it, picks away for Player 4 who then has a chance to
        return to the high post. The possibilities are endless, yet simple to
        anticipate.</td>

<h2>Alaska Play - Additional Explanation</h2>

<p>The Alaska Play is still maturing. We
are not initiating any movement when the ball goes out to the point. When that
happens, we just reset. I was hoping to keep the rules to an absolute minimum so
the kids would learn it faster, but it looks like the pass to point should be
listed as a rule to reset. If the point is open for a clean three, though, we'll
shoot it.</p>
<p><b>The set:</b></p>
<p>3 out and 2 in (high and low) to start. Insist on balanced spacing. High post
follows the ball to maintain alignment of ball - post - basket. Low post plays
opposite side of high post or goes to ball-side corner.</p>
<p><b>The rules:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>If you pass to point, reset</li>
  <li>If you pass to a post, cut to basket</li>
  <li>If you pass to a wing, pick away. Posts pick away only for other post,
    guards pick away for other guards.</li>
  <li>If no pass, and the defense is extended, the point or wing may maintain
    dribble - our signal for the high post to step out a little to initiate a
    pick and roll. (This is the first tendency for my players because they are
    pick/roll oriented and they like to dribble. I am trying to teach them to
    trust the other options because they can get better looks on the cuts).</li>
</ol>
<p><b>What is the role of the high post?</b> The high post's main job is to
follow the ball and maintain a ball - post - basket alignment. If he receives a
pass, the passer will always cut past him looking for a hand-off. If the wing
passes to the corner post, then cuts, the high post can help with a screen.</p>
<p>If the high post has no shot, and must pass, he follows the same rules as
everyone else:</p>
<ol>
  <li>pass to the point, reset.</li>
  <li>pass to the post and cut to the basket</li>
  <li>pass to a wing, pick away (for the other post). Sometimes this simply
    exchanges the positioning of the high and low post players.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>What is the role of the low post? </b>The low post has two options as the ball moves around
the perimeter:</p>

<ol><li>When the ball goes to a wing (who should wait a couple seconds for the
weak-side (point to wing) pick to develop - I've had problems with the wings
being impatient), <b>the low post can move out to that corner.</b> Notice that with the post in the corner, we're in a 4 out, 1 in set, and we have
established a definite strong-side. That gives the wing three good passing options:<br> 
1) to the point which means reset, <br>
2) to the high post which means cut to the basket, <br>
3) or to the low post which means cut to the basket.<br>
If the wing passes to the post, and hustles on the cut to the basket, then V cuts to the wing, the ball can be rotated around the perimeter for a nice weak-side shot.<br><br>
    <b>What happens when the wing passes the ball to the low post in the corner?</b> The
wing cuts to the basket, hoping for a give and go. After the wing cuts through,
  the high post player follows the ball-basket alignment and now resides on the
  ball-side block. If there was no pass to the cutting wing,
the &quot;corner post&quot; has the ball and can then...</li>
<ul>
<li><b>shoot</b></li>
<li><b>pass to wing</b>, which dictates he picks away for the other post. At first this
option was awkward. The solution so far is for the corner post's pick to be set
to allow the original high post (now on the block) to make a cut towards the free throw line where he may
be open. The corner post, now down low, should seal his man and hope for a pass
and shot. In any case the high - low post balance is maintained.</li>
<li><b>pass to high post</b> who has followed the ball alignment and is now on the
ball-side block, which dictates the corner post cut to the basket (give and go).
Now, if the corner post doesn't get a pass on this cut to the basket, he must maintain balance in the set.
The best place he can go is to the weak-side elbow. Now the corner post has
become the high post.</li>
<br>In the case above, the pass was to the original high post who is now on the block. He is now the designated low post because his partner is in the high
post area. So, if the post on the block passes out to a wing, he would pick away for the post at the
elbow. This creates a great opportunity. Either the new high post will be open on
his roll to the basket, or by sealing his man out, the screener is now open. Watch out for a 3 second call, though, when the posts are screening for each
other.<br>
  </ul>&nbsp;
<li><b>If the low post decides not to go out to the corner,</b> then he should stay on
the opposite side of the key from the high post as he follows the ball. The point
is to maintain balance and minimize the number of defenders near the ball. If
both posts are on the same side of the key, its too crowded and hard to pass to
either and there is no room to cut through.<br><br>

Lets say that now the ball is passed to the high post and the low post has
retreated to the weak-side block area instead of going out to the ball-side
corner. The high post has these options:<br>

<ul>
<li><b>Pass out to the point</b>, reset</li>
<li><b>Pass out to wing, pick away</b>. This pick is on the low post's man, and brings
the low post cutting to the ball.</li>
<li><b>Pass to post, cut to basket </b> - unlikely opportunity</li></ul></li></ol>

<p><b>What if the point guard, instead of passing, dribbles to either wing position?</b></p>

<p>Why dribble there? Is it just the path of least resistance or is the point creating something?
Many times I see kids drive wide to the wing area then stop and try to figure out what to do. It would be more productive to pass the ball and
let the wing work his magic. However, let's just assume the point dribbles to wing. The original wing is displaced and it is important for him to get out of
there and take his defense with him. Otherwise the point risks being trapped. I see three ways for the wing to move away.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>The wing could pick for the point as you suggested. The result may be a quick shot for point coming off the screen. Probably the defense,
being that far from the basket, would roll around or through the pick. Then its a long way to go to set a pick for the opposite wing.</li>
<li>Another way to move away would be for the wing to do a shallow cut to the top of the key. They essentially switch places. If the defense
decides to trap/double team, you might get a pass to an open man.</li>
<li>Maybe the best option would be for the displaced wing to cut to the basket and let the weak-side wing rotate to point. Then balance is
maintained. The original point (now at wing) has the normal options of high post, corner post or reset.
</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Problems we have encountered so far:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Players making good cuts, but not expecting the ball and the pass surprises
them. This will fix itself with practice.</li>
<li>Players passing then just standing there instead of picking or cutting. This
is a life-long habit that must be broken anyway. Keep reminding them.</li>
<li>Pass execution. Players are too obvious when passing to the post and the
passes are deflected. With familiarity and practice, players will become less
deliberate and more deceptive. Weakness in passing to the posts has been exposed
and now we can fix it.</li></ol>
