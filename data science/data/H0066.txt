stegosaurus.<br>
<strong>My answer:</strong> A fast answer must be: No! It is no way to find out
how or why any certain dinosaur - or any other pre-historic organism for that
matter - has become extinct; anything that can be said is theory.<br>
<em>Stegosaurus</em> was an early kind of dinosaur, a plant-eating ornitischian
from Late Jurassic, and most likely it died out long before the dinosaurs in
general were extinct at the end of Cretaceous. My guess is that the stegosaurs
were too specialized of their general outfit and too primitive to adapt to the
change of plants which occurred in the Cretaceous. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

what are some of the possible reasons for the extinction of dinosaurs.<br>
<strong>My answer:</strong> In course of times many proposals of the dinosaur extinction

disappearance, and therefore claiming that some catrostrophe took place at the
end of Cretaceous. For the time being two such theories are favourites, &quot;</span><a

lang=EN-GB style='color:red;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The volcano-greenhouse
theory</span></a><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>&quot;
proposed by <span style='color:black'>prof. Dewey McLean.</span> The former
claims that a meteorite hid the earth by the Cretaceous-Tertiary border and
spread enormous amount of dust which darkened the sun and caused dinosaur
extinction, and the latter claims that a volcano belched great amounts of CO2
into the atmosphere which due to green-house effect caused that the dinosaurs
died out in a short time. As for the impact theory it is considered that the
site of the impact has been found near Yucatan where the outline of a gigantic
crater, called the Chicxulub crater has been discovered. That does not,
however, prove that this impact really had the proposed effect of killing the
dinosaurs. <br>
Both of these theories - and many other theories for that matter - are based on
the idea that all the dinosaurs died out suddenly at the same time, an idea of
which there is no evidence. The dinosaurs of which we have remnants are from a
very long period of about 150 mill. years, some of them from the beginning of the
period and dying out early, and others from later in the period and dying out
later. From after the Cretaceous we know of no dinosaur. <br>
It is in fact not possible to know why some organisms die out. As I write in
the article: all animals die; extinction happens because lesser new ones are
born. This causes a decrease of number of individuals until there are too few
left. Such an increase can take very long time and the possible causes are
endless, change of environments and new-coming species are some. But to point
at some specific cause, especially of events which took place that long ago, is
theory - or to be frank, guesswork! <br>
My explanation is, as you may see, rather complicated, but I cannot deny that a
meteorite impact or a volcano eruption or other catastrophically events took
place and caused the final demise of dinosaurs. <br>
Another thing to be thought of is that species of the past may actually not die
out but change into new species. That is surely the case of the two-legged
dinosaurs of the Triassic-Jurassic period that were the </span><a

lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>. These can be said not to be
extinct but to live in shape of birds. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.5pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> </span><span
lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>I cannot agree with the theory of
the changed G-konstant as the reason for the disappearence of the dinosaurs. In
the first place it is no evidence that the G-konstant actually changed,
especially at the time of the dinosaurs' extinction. Secondly there is no
evidence that the dinosaurs died out suddenly because of a catastrophe. These
points are great weaknesses of the theory. <br>
Another great weakness of the theory is that the reptiles which survived the
dinosaurs appeared during the Mesozoic, that is when the dinosaurs existed and
not before. That goes for the lizards and snakes, the crocodiles, and the
turtles; they showed up when the dinosaurs lived. The only reptile from the
time before the dinosaurs may be Sphenodon, the Tuatara of some small islands
off the coast of New Zealand. Also the mammals and the bird as well as the
modern amphibians, frogs, toads, and salamanders, appeared in the Mesozoic, as
did the ray-finned fishes, whereas the lope-finned fishes generally disappeared
at the end of Mesozoic. Many other organisms of the sea also disappeared at the
end of Mesozoic, which is hard to explain by a change of the G-konstant.&nbsp;<span
style='color:black'>Obviously a great change, especially a sudden change of the
G-konstant&nbsp;should have great effects on the life of our globe, but it is
very hard to explain how or why such a change should have taken place.<br>

The basic idea of the theories is that the dinosaurs died out suddenly at the
same time that is which presumption is pure guesswork. The only fact is that
after the Cretaceous we know of no dinosaur. It is likely that no dinosaur
lived after that time, but we don't know for sure. And we don't know if which
had died out earlier and for what reason. It is likely that some dramatic event
happened at the end of Cretaceous, a meteorite impact, a volcano explosion or
some other catastrophe which trigged the finial dinosaur demise, but we don't
know.<br>
In my article I propose that the dinosaurs disappeared just as many modern
animals have disappeared, simply because the conditions of their life were
changed. I think that no dramatic or mysterious causes are needed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<strong>My answer:</strong> No, I cannot say. We do not know why the dinosaurs
do not live anymore. What we know is that from periods later than Cretaceous,
about 65 mill. years ago, we have no trace of dinosaurs.<br>
It is likely that some events took place at the end of Cretaceous, because an
unusually amount of the rare substance, iridium, has been discovered in layers
of clay from that time. But the amounts of iridium are much too small to have
any influence on the survival of the dinosaurs.<br>
The presence of the iridium is ascribed to one of two possible events: A </span><a

Both of these theories have some bearing as a meteorite crater, the Chicxulub
crater, at Yucatán can be dated to that time, and as it can be demonstrated
that great volcanic activity took place in Asia at that time.<br>
But the crux of the matter: Nobody knows if they really disappeared at that
particular time. Some species of dinosaurs may have survived, but have yet not
been discovered. Neither does anybody know if they disappeared suddenly or if they
gradually deceased, species by species over periods of millions of years.<br>
The claim that the dinosaurs suddenly died out according to the said theories
is without evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<b>My answer: </b>The dinosaurs came into existence in the period that is
called Triassic, about 200 million years before Christ. A great number of
species arose during the following period called Jurassic, and they all
disappeared by the end of the next period, the Cretaceous, about 65 million

Man like us did not come into existence until about one million years ago, and

information on the velociraptor.<br>
<strong>My answer: </strong><em>Velociraptor</em> is a dinosaur from Cretaceous
and was very birdlike. I consider it to have been a descendant of the earliest
birds, which had arisen about, 25 million years earlier. Such an early bird
with wings and feathers and with a long tail is </span><a
href="http://odur.let.rug.nl/~nieuwlnd/Archae.html"><em><span lang=EN-GB
style='color:red;mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Archaeopyteryx</span></em></a><span
lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> from the Jurassic. Notice that it
looks very much like a small <em>Velociraptor</em>.<br>
Just like the ostrich of today many of the early birds gave up flying and run
on the ground; many became rather tallish. They lost the feathers and their
wings were transformed into arm-like limbs. <em>Velociraptor</em> was one of
them.<br>
<em>Velociraptor</em> and the other descendants of the early birds are by most
scientists called 'dinosaurs', but you must be aware that these scientists also
call birds 'dinosaurs', which is confusing. <em>Velociraptor</em>, which was
rather small, no more than a turkey, had a large, sharp, scythe-shaped claw on
its middle toe, and some scientists believe that <em>velociraptor</em> and its
like used this toe for killing its victims by ripping. I think that they are
wrong as I cannot imagine how such a two-footed animal like <em>Velociraptor</em>
could possibly stand on its one foot while it cut the belly of a tall, live
dinosaur with its other foot. I think that <em>Velociraptor</em> mostly lived on
death or dying animals and used its claws to cut the tough skin and carve the
meat of such a fallen prey.<br>
In the movie, Jurassic Park is <em>Velociraptor</em> presented as tall and very
alert creature which chases kids and can open doors with its hands. That is all
wrong! It is no reason to consider <em>Velociraptor</em> to have been in any
way smarter and more alert than any modern birds of prey. And as its wrists
were little movable, it could not use its forelimbs for anything else but
holding on to a prey while biting off it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

EN-GB'>Jack Shea then asked: </span></b><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:
EN-GB'>Binocular vision would seem to be a prerequisite to
&quot;intelligence&quot; (thinking is a kind of stereoscopic process it would
seem to me). Also I was thinking that warm-bloodedness might also be a
prerequisite. Just a hunch that a brain would need constant warmth in order to
develop the full range of thinking and emotional potentials, which we regard as
human. Is there any mileage in this?<br>
<b>I answered: </b>Warm-bloodedness is surely a condition of thinking in human
sense, but you must hold in mind that it is no evidence of the dinosaurs being
warm-blooded, however often that is claimed.<br>
As for the development of an &quot;intelligent&quot; brain, the problem is what
intelligence is. Not to be philosophical we may say that intelligence is an
ability to behave rationally in a not-innate manner contrary to an instinctive,
innate manner. To be advantageous, it must be in animals, which are constantly
alert, i.e. with a constant body-temperature and consequently demands
warm-bloodedness.<br>
In human is the stereoscopic vision undoubtedly a precondition of the
particular kind of intelligence of man, but I am not sure if it is excluded
that intelligence as the ability to behave rationally in a not-innate manner
could not evolve in animals without that kind of vision.<br>
Most likely a binocular vision is a prerequisite to &quot;intelligence&quot;,
but we neither know if the dinosaurs had or would have evolved that kind of
vision. Some birds of prey have stereoscopic vision, but that does not mean
that it evolved in dinosaurs.<br>
The idea of the dinosaurs evolving into human-like it is connected with the
idea that the dinosaurs did not die out of natural causes and would have
survived and evolved further, if some catastrophe had not occurred.<br>
I think that this idea is all wrong. In the first place we don&#8217;t know if the
dinosaurs extinction was due to a catastrophe; we have no proof thereof.
Secondly the dinosaurs were in any respect primitive animals that lived and
filled out niches of the past world to which they were adapted. Except from the
bird-ancestors the dinosaurs as such had no potentials for further evolution
and would surely have died out in any case. <br>
The group of dinosaurs from which all the ideas of the warm-blooded, active
dinosaurs are based is the very bird-like ones from Cretaceous, and they were
not really dinosaurs, but bird-ancestors which had given-up the flight, i.e.
ostriches of Cretaceous. And no birds have evolved into human-like shape or
intelligence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Jack Shea replied: </span></b><span
lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>The human evolutionary model will
inevitably form the basis of the extrapolation to dinosaurs evolving
intelligence, tool use, science, etc. Is there any possibility of reptiles
evolving into mammals? In other words, is there any possibility that the human
race has evolved from dinosaur/reptilian ancestors? Along the same lines, can
we be certain that dinosaurs were reptiles?<br>
Brontosaurus, for example, has very &quot;elephantine&quot; characteristics.
Could it have been, like the elephant, a mammal? Similarly Triceratops, a
rhinoceros-like creature. A mammal? Has anyone ever proposed such a thing?<br>
My thinking in stereoscopic vision was that it would seem, as a
&quot;left-right comparative image system&quot; to be a kind of physical
precursor of &quot;rationality&quot;, which as the word suggests involves
comparing one thing with another, and is fundamental to our human intelligence,
which is based on successions of comparisons, and language which provides a
verbal equivalent (or comparison) of a word with an object.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>To this I had this
reply:</span></b><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> It is an
&quot;anthropomorphic&quot; idea that man is the summit of evolution, and as we
are warm-blooded, two-legged, agile, talking and thinking beings evolution of
other vertebrates must be towards these qualities. <br>
But that is not how evolution works. Evolution is an improvement of the ability
to survive and to have most surviving offspring under the actual conditions.
Because the achievement of thinking, talking, and intelligence was such an
improvement in the human ancestors, it has not necessarily be so in other
vertebrates.<br>
The &quot;anthropomorphic&quot; idea has caused the myth that the dinosaurs
were warm-blooded, agile, almost intelligent animals, although there is no
evidence whatsoever that they were. And it is more than doubtful what
improvement it could be for dinosaurs to evolve these qualities and especially
a power of thinking and talking. An exchange of the fast innate - instinctive -
behaviour by the slow thinking manner is hardly a general advance.<br>
The dinosaurs split up into numerous groups of very different forms, among
these a tall group of bird-like ones, some of which were the dromaeosaurs. They
lived in the Cretaceous that is more than 20 million years after the origin of
birds and descended obviously from birds, which had given up flying. As they
were birds they had evolved feathers, warm-bloodedness, tall brains, and
binocular vision as remedies for flying. That means that they were not in a
state of evolving &quot;human&quot; traits, but maintained some of these
bird-qualities.<br>
As for the dinosaurs which were not bird-descendants, it is no reason to think
that they had warm-bloodedness, tall brains, binocular vision, or other
&quot;human-like&quot; traits, simply because they had no need of it. That is
why the dinosaurs had no potential for further evolution. They were simply at
the optimal stage of evolution and could not improve further.<br>
The likeliness of Brontosaurus and Triceratops to elephants and rhinoceroses it
due to a similar manner of living. Modern systematics consider dinosaurs as not
reptiles, but as a group of their own, dinosauria, and for systematic reasons
birds are considered to belong that group. Mammals are only far related to
dinosaurs, and they originated long before the dinosaurs from medium-sized
mammal-like reptiles. They did not evolve into present forms until after the
dinosaur extinction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

assuming partly has to do with their teeth structure? <br>
<b>My answer: </b>We cannot&nbsp;really know which dinosaurs were plant eaters
and which were meat eaters; but their teeth give an indication. However, it is
not that uncomplicated simply because we don&#8217;t know what the teeth of many
dinosaurs were like.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
dinosaurs are divided into more groups, one of which is the ornitischians. The
general characteristic of these is their backward rotated pubic bone. Many
ornitischians&#8217; teeth were obviously unfit for meat eating why it is assumed
that this entire group was plant eating. The general appearance of the ornitischians,
the four-footed ceratopians, stegosaurs, and ankylosaurs indicates that they
were not carnivore, and the bipedal ornithopodes, among which were <i>Iguanodon</i>
with typical plant-eating teeth as well as the hadrosaurs with broad mouths with
no front teeth, were obviously plant eaters. From this is concluded that all
ornitischians were plant eaters<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
for the other main group of dinosaurs, the saurischians, the general
characteristic of which is the forward rotated pubic bone is the case more
complicated. Some saurischians, the tall <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> and <i>Allosaurus,</i>
had large, serrated teeth, obviously perfectly adapted for carving meat, and it
is an easy conclusion that they were meat eaters, and that the dinosaurs with
their general characteristics, tall, two-legged, and short-necked, the
carnosaurs, were carnivore. That does not, however, mean that they were
predators; they may quite well have been scavengers.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
a group of saurischians, the enormous four-legged and long-necked sauropods,
had teeth that apparently were completely unfit for eating meat and obviously
were plant eaters, which is in accordance with their general appearance. But a
group to which the sauropods were closely related, the long necked
pro-sauropods were long disputed and considered meat eaters. Now they are
considered to have been plant eaters, partly because of the shape of their
teeth, partly from their appearance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
it is a group of dinosaurs, the coelurosaurs which are considered to be related
to the carnosaurs and thus generally to have been meat eaters. A group of
these, the dromaeosaurs, &#8220;raptors&#8221;, <i>Deinonychosaurus</i>, <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>,
<i>Velociraptor</i>, <i>Ornitholestes</i>, and <i>Oviraptor </i>were furnished
with sharp teeth and sharp claws and no doubt meet eaters &#8211; predators or
scavengers. But a closely related group were the ornithomimosaurs such as <i>Struthiomimus</i>,
<i>Gallimimus</i>, and <i>Ornithomimus</i>, which in many respects appeared
like the raptors, but had bird&#8217;s bill and no sharp claws! It is really not
possible to say for certain if they were plant eaters or eat small living pray,
maybe both. My guess is that they were plant eaters, but nobody can say for
sure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:0cm'><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
you should be aware of is that meat eating and plant eating demands a very
different physiology. Meat is much more nourishing than plants and much easier
to digest, why the alimentary system, stomach and guts, in carnivore can be
shorter than in vegetarians. Plant eaters must eat much more, and to digest
plant material is needed heavy mechanical working, which in the later
ornitischians was performed by chewing. The sauropods performed it by
swallowing stones, which in the stomach grinded the plant parts. A similar
mechanic method in digestion is to be found in plant eating birds which have a
gizzard, and likely therefore also in the ornithomimosaurs. The advantage of
eating plants is of course that it is much easier to get.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Tyrannosaurus rex and I need to know how they had babies. I do know that they
came from eggs. But how long did they stay in the egg, and how were they
fertilized? Also, how long did a Tyrannosaurus live?<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p><b><span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>My answer:</span></b><span
lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> Actually nobody really knows how
Tyrannosaurus lived and breeded. All that can be said is more or less qualifies
guesswork. <br>
Tyrannosaurs belong to group of the bipedal, short-necked carnosaurs, which -
contrary to the long necked, bird-like coelurosaurs - were rather primitive,
almost like two-legged, land living crocodiles to which they are related.
Therefore it is a likely presumption that they laid eggs with shells of chalk
and buried them in sand, mud, or vegetables to hatch by the heat of the sun or
vegetable decomposition. As the crocodile eggs take eighty to eighty-four days
to hatch and as the tyrannosaur egg was taller, the hatching period could be
estimated to about half a year, but no longer as it is a limit to how long a
foetus can stay alive in that kind of egg. Besides the longer the eggs are
un-hatched, the greater is the risk of it being destroyed or eaten by
egg-robbers.&nbsp; <br>
Judging from the size of the opening between the pubic bones the tyrannosaurs'
eggs could not have been particular tall, rather like that of an ostrich egg,
and consequently were the hatchlings very small, and as such exposed to be
eaten by various predators.<br>
The female crocodile stays in the neighbourhood of the nest and takes the
hatchlings to the water, which is not due to &quot;mother-care&quot;, but an
instinctive behaviour, and it is unlikely that the tyrannosaurs - or any
dinosaurs for that matter - took care of their hatchling. On the contrary were
the tyrannosaur-hatchlings rather in danger of being eaten by their parents. <br>
(The popular idea that dinosaurs were careful mothers is a sentimental
miscomprehension of a dinosaur nest with hatchlings. There is no evidence that
they were neither feeded nor protected by a mamma-dinosaur. Maiasaura,
&quot;the good mother reptile&quot; is a part of the myth which gave rice to
the &quot;disney-fication&quot; of dinosaurs as either cute or bad. That is in
not scientific, but fairy tale.) <br>
The breeding strategy of the tyrannosaurs was most likely to lay a great amount
of smaller eggs - as crocodiles and turtles do - thereby increasing the chance
that a few eggs hatched and of these one or two hatchlings survived till adult
age. The net breeding rate must&nbsp;have been very little, otherwise the world
should have been over floated with tyrannosaurs and with not sufficient
feed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Crocodiles have on the lower wall of the cloacae a penis-like organ that is
grooved along its upper side, allowing the spermatozoa to travel into the female
cloacae to fertilize the eggs. Also some birds possess such a penis-like organ
why it is a likely presumption that it was also present in tyrannosaurs and
other dinosaurs. <br>
The tyrannosaurs can be imagined to have mated as the male mounted the female's
back protruding his penis-like organ into her cloacae as birds do. As
tyrannosaurus did not have wings they needed another aid to keep the balance
during the process. Their extremely small, but strong and sharp clawed
forelimbs must have served for that purpose as the male could take a close grip
of the female and as she used her forelimbs to hold to the ground so that the
couple did not to upset during the performance. This explains why forelimbs
were maintained in the bipedal dinosaurs.<br>
My pen drawing may give you an idea of how tyrannosaurs may have mated. <br>
It is impossibly to say how long a tyrannosaurus could live. Even if they
supposedly grew fast, it must nevertheless have taken many years to reach the
enormous size we know of them. Like crocodiles they could have grown as long as
they lived. Crocodiles and turtles can be more than a hundred years old, and it
seems reasonably that a tyrannosaur could obtain such an age, but only the
fewest of them did that. A grown-up tyrannosaur with the size of about 15 meter
had surely no real enemies, but most were surely killed soon after hatching,
and others passed away from injuries, wounds, and diseases long before they
grew to full size and age.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
