<tr><td>Bermuda 0, Antigua 0<br><br>

Bermuda got the result they came for at the Recreation Grounds in St. John's yesterday - but it could have been so much better.<br><br>

Antigua played the last 40 minutes with 10 men after defender George Dublin was sent off for his second yellow card and from that moment on, Bermuda dominated.<br><br>

Young substitute John Barry Nusum missed two excellent chances and midfielder Paul Cann also fluffed a gilt-edged opportunity, as the visitors piled on late pressure.<br><br>

If one of those chances had fallen to Kyle Lightbourne or Shaun Goater, Bermuda would likely be bringing home a victory, and there could be no more graphic illustration of why they need their professional strikers in the World Cup.<br><br>

However, the goalless draw leaves Bermuda favourites to finish the job off in the second leg at the National Stadium on Sunday and advance to a third World Cup qualifying round against St Kitts or St Vincent. St.Vincent won their home leg 1-0 yesterday.<br><br>

The Antiguan team were much more experienced than the Antigua Football Association had earlier indicated with 19-year-olds Janiel Simon and Troy Simon the youngest in the starting 11, and three players around the 30 mark.<br><br>

From the outset, it was clear Bermuda would be playing with only Steve Astwood up front, but despite the defensive formation, they made the first serious attack after just two minutes.<br><br>

Left wingback Stanton Lewis curled in a fine cross which was weakly cleared to the edge of the penalty area, where Astwood's first-time snap-shot crept just wide of the right-hand upright.<br><br>

The home side's first real threat came in the eighth minute when the lively Quentin Clarke raced through on goal and keeper Dwayne Adams came rushing out of his penalty area to boot the ball to safety.<br><br>

Bermuda dominated the opening 15 minutes, with Meshach Wade and Kentoine Jennings doing most of the prompting from midfield.<br><br>

A glorious ball by Jennings in the 12th minute sent right wingback Tokia Russell racing down the flank and his excellent low cross was toe-poked inches wide of his own goal by Antigua central defender Skeal Phillip, as Astwood lurked behind him.<br><br>

The Caribbean side then started to get their game going, using a short passing style which made the most of the immaculate surface, used primarily for cricket.<br><br>

A few crosses were swung dangerously into the Bermuda penalty area, but Karl and Clifford Roberts won the aerial battles time and again.<br><br>

When Antigua's leading scorer Derrick Edwards finally got his head to a cross 10 yards from goal, Adams dived to his left to pluck it out of the air.<br><br>

The Bermuda defence were caught out on the half hour, when a deftly chipped pass from the edge of the box by Morlon Tonge was volleyed way wide from a good position by Edwards.<br><br>

Bermuda battled to hold their own up to half-time, as Antigua imposed themselves on the game.<br><br>

And in the first minute of the second period, Antigua went close to an opening goal when Quentin Clarke hit an rasping drive from an acute angle just over the angle of post and crossbar.<br><br>

But the visitors soon settled down again and with Russell pushing forward more and more up the right flank, Bermuda appeared to be coming out of their defensive shell.<br><br>

Bermuda received a boost when Dublin got his marching orders in the 55th minute. The defender, who had been cautioned earlier for time wasting at a throw-in, committed an equally foolish offence to pick up his second yellow card, hauling over Wade by his shirt yards away from the referee.<br><br>

The incident silenced the crowd of 3,000 or so and sparked Bermuda into life.<br><br>

Wade's driving run and perfect pass created a clear-cut chance for Paul Cann, but he shot tamely wide from 15 yards. Jennings volleyed wide from 10 yards following a corner and the Bermuda bench decided to go for a more offensive strategy, replacing midfielder Boyles with striker Nusum in the 65th minute.<br><br>

Nusum soon made his presence felt and did well to reach a through ball ahead of the home defenders, but his feeble shot was easy for Simon to save.<br><br>

Cann created a great opening for Nusum, unmarked 15 yards from goal, but the youngster hesitated and was hounded out by defenders.<br><br>

Substitute Errol Barnes gave Bermuda a scare late in the game when he beat Adams to a long ball, but his lob drifted high over the bar.<br><br></tr></td>

<tr><td>Bermuda 9 British Virgin Islands 0<br><br>

Professionals Shaun Goater and Kyle Lightbourne were hardly missed in this second leg of the World Cup first round qualifier as Bermuda had seven different scorers in their rout at National Stadium yesterday.<br><br>

Bermuda had all but wrapped up the tie when they came back from the Caribbean two weeks ago with a 5-1 lead after the first leg. That left BVI with a mountain to climb, needing to score at least five times to have any chance of advancing.<br><br>

But in unfamiliar blustery and cool conditions, which forced one BVI player to wear white gloves, their task was made all the more difficult when they conceded their first goal and had a player sent off inside the first 15 minutes.<br><br>

After only managing two goals in the entire first half, Bermuda went on a scoring rampage after the interval, netting their next four goals in a frantic eight minute period soon after the restart.<br><br>

Stephen Astwood and substitute John Barry Nusum scored the last four to finish with two apiece as the visitors welcomed Haitian referee Rosnick Grant's final whistle which ended the massacre - and their humiliation.<br><br>

Bermuda, forced into four changes because of unavailability and suspension, needed just six minutes to break the deadlock when Devarr Boyles' shot took a deflection before beating 'keeper Desrie Butler.<br><br>

Butler got little help from his defence as Bermuda scored from all angles. By comparison, Dwayne (Streaker) Adams had a virtual day off at the other end.<br><br>

BVI resorted to niggling tackles to try to stop the fast Bermuda front line who were ably supported by wingbacks Tokia Russell and Stanton Lewis.<br><br>

Ronald Salmon was booked for a foul on Rohaan Simons and then in the 14th minute Wendell Nicholls was ejected for a foul on the same player as Simons was about to have a free run into the box from a Boyles pass.<br><br>

A man short and already a goal down, which made it 6-1 overall, the British Virgin Islands knew it was a lost cause as Bermuda took full control.

Midfielder Paul Cann curled a shot just over the bar after Boyles' forward run was stopped. Then a shot from Astwood produced a good save by Butler.<br><br>

Bermuda, under no pressure, were able to play freely as the new strike pair of Astwood and Simons enjoyed themselves up front. Adams made one of his few saves midway through the half when Dwight Browne was put through and the keeper blocked the ball for a corner.<br><br>

Bermuda also played with 10 men for a few minutes when Meshach Wade limped off for treatment to a thigh injury from physio Maureen Ryan.<br><br>

But soon after his return, and after Prince Williams shot just over the bar from a free kick, Bermuda scored their second goal in the 34th minute. Tokia Russell's effort from outside the box beat Butler in flight as he anticipated a cross to the back post and the ball deflected off his body and into goal.<br><br>

Russell was unlucky not to make it 3-0 six minutes into the second half when his strong run into the box on the right side ended with a shot that hit the underside of the crossbar before being cleared.<br><br>

Soon after that the floodgates opened up with goals coming in the 53rd, 57th, 60th and 61st minutes to make it 7-0 for the day and 12-1 overall. Wade hit the third with a blast from 15 yards that went inside the 'keeper's right hand post.<br><br>

Simons was the victim of another foul, this time inside the box which earned Bermuda a penalty and this time captain Shannon Burgess tucked his spot kick inside the post.<br><br>

Thomas Carter replaced Wade just before the penalty was taken and the US-based midfielder quickly settled into his midfield role.<br><br>

Lewis blasted a low shot into the far bottom corner from an angle on the left side to make it 5-0 on the hour as BVI's defence was penetrated again.<br><br>

A minute later Butler was picking another ball out of the back of the net when Astwood took a pass from Boyles to drill in a low shot.<br><br>

Bermuda made two more substitutions, bringing on Nusum for Simons and Andrew Rahman for Lewis. Nusum helped himself to the seventh goal, following up on a shot from Carter from 25 yards that the 'keeper parried and the BVI defence failed to clear, Nusum tucked his shot into the far bottom corner.<br><br>

It was all one way traffic now as Butler made a good save when he tipped a shot from Astwood over the bar. But the PHC hit-man was not to be denied, scoring easily in the 80th minute when Boyles put him clear. Rounding Butler he got to the goal-line, stopped the ball and dropped to his knees and headed the ball over the line.<br><br>

Nusum, brought back from college for the match, added his second in injury time when he met Russell's free kick into the box and scored with a powerful header into the bottom corner.<br><br></tr></td>

<H3>Nusum added to World Cup squad</H3></td></tr><tr><td>

<tr><td>Bermuda, March 15, 2000</td></tr>
<tr><td>College student John Barry Nusum will be brought back for Bermuda's World Cup qualifier against the British Virgin Islands on Sunday.
Technical Director Clyde Best confirmed yesterday that Nusum would fly in later this week to join the squad for Sunday's match. Best had earlier indicated the under-23 striker wouldn't be required, but yesterday he admitted that the teenager was now a part of his plans.
"I spoke to him last week, Robert (Calderon) and I talked about it, and I think we're going to bring him home," said Best.
"We have so many talented under-23 players right now that any one of 10 or 14 could be in the national team. He'll come in and do a good job for us."
Nusum, who was previously a defensive player, has developed into a striker in the last couple of seasons and with his powerful build and eye for goal has quickly made a name for himself on the US college scene.
But he may have to play just a substitute's role on Sunday with Rohaan Simons and Stephen Astwood expected to fill the void left by professionals Kyle Lightbourne and Shaun Goater in the Bermuda front line.
Assistant national coach, Mark Trott, doesn't expect any complacency from the players, despite the comfortable 5-1 lead they take into the match from the first leg.
"I don't think winning 5-1 is playing on their minds at all," said Trott.
"They're hoping for a big crowd and looking forward to playing before the Bermuda public. There are younger guys who will be trying to solidify themselves in the 18. One or two of them are on the fringe."
Trott noted that the BVI crowd, which numbered only about 500, got behind their team even when they were heading for defeat.
"Even when they were losing 5-1, whenever they were doing something positive, the fans kept cheering them on," said Trott, who sees similar support from the Bermuda fans as vital to the team's long-term success.
Meanwhile, Best is still looking to have a stern word with defender Kentoine Jennings over his conduct in the BVI match when he was sent off early in the first half for abusive language.
"We have to sit down and talk," said Best. "He has to understand his responsibilities, not just to himself but his team-mates and his country. I hope he has learned from it."</td></tr>

<tr><td>Shaun Goater plundered a hat-trick after ten men of Bermuda got their World Cup campaign off to a rip roaring start yesterday.<br><br>

Things looked bleak when defender Kentoine Jennings was red-carded for using foul and abusive language after just nine minutes with the score at 0-0 and BVI piling on early pressure.<br><br>

But when the game settled down, Bermuda's four professionals asserted their class. Goater scored three, one a penalty, while Kyle Lightbourne and Paul Cann chipped in with the others.<br><br>

Harrisburg Heat team-mates David Bascome and Meshach Wade showed composure and class as they took the midfield by the scruff of the neck. The excellent touch both have developed in the indoor game in the US was useful for keeping the ball under control on a surface which in places resembled pock-marked concrete.<br><br>

The four-goal cushion almost certainly means that both Goater and Lightbourne will be spared from selection for the second leg to concentrate on their promotion campaigns with Manchester City and Stoke respectively.<br<br>

Now only a disaster in the second leg at the National Stadium on March 19 would deny the Island a berth in a second round qualifier against Antigua next month.<br><br>

The game got off to a lively start with both sides almost finding the net inside the first two minutes.<br><br>

First, a through ball by Wade caused panic in the home defence and BVI goalkeeper Monti Butler won a race for the ball with Lightbourne by a whisker.<br><br>

But Bermuda's goalkeeper Dwayne (Streaker) Adams had to be at his best to deny the Caribbean side seconds later when he dived to his right to tip wide a dipping 35-yard volley by Prince Williams.<br><br>

Adams was in action again in the sixth minute when he hung onto Dwight Browne's curling 25-yard free kick.<br><br>

Just when it seemed Bermuda had weathered the storm, disaster struck when Jennings was dismissed by Bahamas referee Cavdel McNab after the North Village defender swore as he disputed a throw-in decision.<br><br>

The small but raucous crowd were encouraged as the BVI side upped the tempo, but their excitement soon turned to disappointment as Bermuda seized the iniative with two goals in three minutes. The breakthrough came in the 19th minute when Tokia Russell cut inside from the right flank and played a delightful reverse ball to Cann.<br><br>

The Dandy Town player struck a superb curling cross, a la David Beckham, which the unmarked Lightbourne leapt to head home with relish at the far post.<br><br>

Another Lightbourne header was the key to the second goal in the 22nd minute. Wade played the ball forward and the Stoke man rose high above his marker to nod on for Cann, who hit a low shot on the run which spun into the net off the fingertips of the floundering Butler.<br><br>

Even with their numerical disadvantage, Bermuda took control of the midfield, where Bascome and Cann constantly probed for openings which were not too difficult to find against the sloppy home defence.<br><br>

The professional strikers teamed up to create the third Bermuda goal on 34 minutes. Lightbourne's chip forward found Goater, who nonchalantly lobbed the ball over his marker's head before lofting the ball gently over Butler and into the net.<br><br>

Four minutes later, it should have been 4-0 when Bascome played in Lightbourne but he blazed over the bar from 12 yards with his less-favoured right foot.<br><br>

Bermuda were not having it all their own way, though, and only two more excellent saves by Adams stopped BVI from pulling a goal back before the interval.<br><br>

First, Clifford Roberts was caught out by a long ball which put the pacey Peterson Azile in the clear and his scorching drive from 15 yards looked a certain goal, before Adams reacted like lightning to tip it onto the crossbar. Then Rohan Lennon burst through the visitors' undermanned rearguard and as he waited too long to shoot Adams dived bravely at his feet to steal the ball. Goater grabbed his second two minutes into the second half. Wingback Stanton Lewis played an inviting cross from the left which Lightbourne poked goalwards but defender Wendall Nichols managed to scramble it onto the post. The rebound fell kindly to Goater who tapped in from a yard out.<br><br>

Bermuda were now oozing confidence and a subline backheel by Bascome sparked a sweeping move which almost brought a fifth goal. Cann crossed for Goater and his dummy played in Lightbourne who was hounded out by defenders.<br><br>

BVI hit back with their first-ever World Cup goal on the hour, which resulted from a controversial decision from referee McNab, who awarded handball against Russell, whose back was turned at the time it hit him. Prince Williams converted from the spot.<br><br>

Three minutes later Bermuda had a penalty of their own, when Bascome's free kick was handled by Donald Smile. Goater sent Butler the wrong way to complete his hat-trick and round off the scoring.<br><br>

The game deteriorated in the last half hour with both sides giving the ball away regularly, but with five away goals and a big winning margin to take home, it was a case of a job well done for Bermuda.</td></tr><tr><td> </td></tr><td>BVI: M.Butler; W.Nichols, D.Browne, O.Roach, R.Lennon, D.Smile, K.Simmonds (W.Williams 67 mins), P.Azile (G.Ferron 67 mins), P.Williams, M.Savage (D.Thompson 57 mins), R.Salmon.<br><br>
