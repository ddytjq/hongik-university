      <p>You have a choice of repayment methods:</p>
      <p><STRONG class="redtext">Interest Only</STRONG><br>
      With this option your monthly payments are lower because they only cover 
        the interest on your loan. However, the amount you borrow remains outstanding 
        and will have to be repaid at the end of the term. You will need the funds 
        available to repay the capital from another source such as an ISA, endowment 
        policy or personal pension plan. You can also repay the amount borrowed 
        from your own personal resources.</p>
      <p><STRONG class="redtext">Repayment</STRONG><br>
      Each month you pay both the interest on the loan and part of the capital 
        so that your Buy To Let Mortgage or Student Buy To Let Mortgage is repaid 
        in full by the end of the agreed term.</p>
      <p><STRONG class="redtext">Protecting your Mortgage</STRONG><br>
      With both a repayment mortgage and an interest only mortgage, life assurance 
        should be arranged so that the loan is repaid in the event of your death.</p>
      <p><STRONG class="redtext">Early Repayment</STRONG><br>
      <STRONG>If you repay a Buy To Let Mortgage and/or Chelsea Student Buy To Let 
        Mortgage or make an early repayment of capital, interest will be payable 
        up to the end of the month in which the repayment is made. If such repayment 
        is made within the first 3 years of the mortgage term, an additional fee 
        of 2% of the sum repaid will be charged unless the mortgage is simultaneously 
        replaced with a new Chelsea mortgage on a different property. </STRONG></p>
      <p><STRONG>However up to 20% of the capital balance may be repaid each year without 
        an early repayment charge being made.</STRONG></p>

        </strong> The above example is based on a discounted rate of 3.94%, typical 
        <STRONG><acronym title="Annual Percentage Rate">APR</acronym> <font size="3"> 
        6.1%</font></STRONG> variable, for the first 6 months and a rate of 5.94% 
        which includes an additional 0.25% over the Society's current standard 
        variable rate of 5.69%, typical <STRONG>APR <font face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, Sunsans-regular" size="3">5.9%</font></STRONG> 
        variable, for the remainder of the term. It has been assumed that each 
        of these rates will apply for the whole of the periods to which they relate. 
        However, rates may well be different and will rise and fall throughout 
        the term. The total amount payable figure includes repayment of the loan 
        at the end of the term. <STRONG>A means of repayment of the loan will 
        need to be arranged.</STRONG></p>
      <p>Where the purchase price or valuation is up to or including &pound;250,000 
        you may borrow up to 80%. Where the purchase price or valuation is above 
        &pound;250,000 a lower percentage will apply.<br>
        The typical example shown is based on an interest only mortgage of &pound;50,245 
        (purchase price &pound;80,000) completed in the middle of March 2002 with 
        the first monthly payments due in April 2002. The APR, monthly payment 
        figure and total amount payable figure shown are based on the following 
        assumption:</p>
      <p>It has been assumed that the interest rate of 3.94% prevails for the 
        first 6 months of the mortgage. For the remainder of the term it is assumed 
        that the rate of 5.94% prevails. It should be remembered however, that 
        the interest rates are actually variable from the outset.</p>
