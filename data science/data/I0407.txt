beer on the concourses. One bonus on our last visit was that all the heated but unsold food
(inlcuding several boxes full of burgers) were given free to away fans on leaving.
</P><P>We have had several people (including local fans) recommend that colours
are kept well hidden until inside the ground.  (See fans section for 
more info).

London Bridge is suggested) and travel to the ground with colours well
hidden.
(see fans section).
</P><P>One pub particulary popular with away fans is The Market Porter near London Bridge, which normally
has a friendly mix of Millwall, Charlton and (without colours) visiting fans.

Whilst it's probably not sensible to go on in away colours on our last visit we found a mix of Millwall, Charleton and 
visiting fans and contrary to popular belief we were all friendly towards each other.
</P><P>The pub has a very, very wide range of real ales (20+) and the TV (with Sky Sports) looks a little out of place in the
traditional wooden decor.
</P><P>The pub always seems to get good review on the many London pub/real ale guides on the Internet. The pub's food also comes
higly recommended.

years, however they do still have a very active Hooligan element.
</P><P>It is probably worth pointing out that once inside the ground The New Den
is possibly one of the safest places to be due to the huge police
presence. It is also clear from our research that the vast majority
of Millwall fans despise the hooligan element. Especially as this means
that all traveling Millwall fans get a far from friendly welcome when
traveling away from home.
</P><P>Glenn from Awayguide adds -
</P><P>Whilst Millwall's reputation is probably well deserved, on our last visit we couldn't have
hoped from friendlier fans, in the pub, on the tube, on the walk from the tube to the ground and the stewards
inside the ground everyone we came across was friendly and welcoming.
