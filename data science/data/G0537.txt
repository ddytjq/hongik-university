      rains in the middle of the ocean? Farmers, forestry managers,
      and landowners, among others. While the weather forecast over
      a particular part of the ocean may be of little interest, it
      has implications for everyone.</P>

      <P>&quot;Rain over water affects the climate of the whole planet,&quot;
      said Robbie Hood of the Global Hydrology and Climate Center in
      Huntsville (GHCC). &quot;It releases energy into the atmosphere.
      What happens in the tropics is extremely important to the climate
      of the whole Earth. If you can't measure rain over the ocean,
      you're missing a lot of activity and you'll never truly understand
      what is happening to the weather across the world.&quot;</P>

    <!--/NOEDIT-->In November 1997, NASA and Japan's National
      Space Development Agency (NASDA) launched the Tropical Rainfall
      Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite to develop methods to plug
      those holes. But we first have to know if we are correctly interpreting
      what TRMM is telling us. The most important data are the sizes
      and quantities of raindrops, and whether they actually hit the
      surface or get carried away by vertical air movement.</P>

      <P>&quot;The TRMM team wanted field experiments from the very
      beginning because it knew there would be issues about validating
      the results from the satellite,&quot; said Dr. Eric Smith director
      of the GHCC. To date, TRMM has been supported by three experiment
      campaigns (see box).</P>

      <P>The fourth experiment got under way on July 23 - at least
      18 aircraft missions have been flown so far (see list at end
      of story) - and runs through Sept. 15 in the Central Pacific
      Ocean. Operating out of the Kwajalein Atoll, a U.S. Army missile
      test site, scientists with instruments aboard three aircraft,
      a ship, and TRMM are conducting the Kwajelein Experiment (KWAJEX)
      to measure rain physics in and under thunderstorms over the open
      ocean. Their sorties will be timed to coincide (when possible)
      with overflights by TRMM which is equipped with a Precipitation
      Radar, a Lightning Imaging Sensor, and other instruments that
      could be used on operational satellites in the future.</P>

      weather and our long-term climate might be affected not only
      by human activities, but by natural phenomena such as El Ni&ntilde;o
      as well,&quot; said Dr. Ramesh Kakar, the TRMM program scientist
      at NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC.&nbsp;</P>

      <P>&quot;With its radar and microwave instruments, the satellite
      obtains a large-scale view of precipitation, but with less detail
      than many surface-based instruments. In contrast, ground and
      airborne measurements allow us to really understand the three-dimensional
      structure and evolution of tropical storm systems,&quot; said
      Steve Hipskind, Chief of the Atmospheric Chemistry and Dynamics
      Branch at NASA's Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif.
      &quot;Even without the satellite, these field experiments are
      leading to significant scientific progress in understanding precipitation
      processes.&quot;</P>

      <P>&quot;KWAJEX has always been the central&nbsp; field experiment
      since TRMM was designed for rain over open oceans,&quot; Smith
      explained. &quot;When the TRMM ground radar validation network
      was set up in Darwin (Australia), Melbourne (Fla.), Houston,
      Texas, and Kwajalein, it was clear that Kwajalein was the only
      open-ocean radar site.&quot;

      the atolls are so small they should have no influence on rain
      systems. Various surrounding islands will launch radiosondes,
      instrument-bearing balloons that radio back readings of temperature,
      moisture, and winds as they ascend through clouds. Another balloon
      will be tethered at Meck Island. To the southwest of Kwajalein
      Island, the NOAA research vessel Ronald H. Brown will watch with
      a Doppler radar similar to a unit on Kwajalein, allowing scientists

      </TABLE>&quot;An issue that has plagued atmospheric scientists
      for a long time is the size distribution of rain drops,&quot;
      Hood said. &quot;No one instrument is a truly accurate, valid
      source. Rain gauges can err, there are assumptions in the way
      we interpret radar. There are a lot of errors and biases in all
      of the measuring devices.&quot;</P>

      <P>In addition to balloons and radar on Kwajelein and the R/V
      Ron Brown, KWAJEX will employ the University of Washington's
      Convair 580, and the University of North Dakota's Cessna Citation.
      The ER-2 high-altitude aircraft used in other TRMM experiments
      will not be used because it would involve overwater flights too
      long for safe operation by a single-engine jet.</P>

      <P>&quot;We are bringing in microphysics aircraft with special
      instruments,&quot; Smith said. &quot;In that same context, we're
      going to do vertical profiles, the Holy Grail for cloud researchers
      for years, to get vertical slices of cloud microphysics. We've
      never had an experiment designed to do that over the deep ocean.&quot;</P>

      <P>Because storms cannot be scheduled to coincide with TRMM's
      overflights, NASA has equipped the DC-8 with the GHCC's Advanced
      Microwave Precipitation Radiometer (AMPR) that matches the TRMM
      Microwave Imager. The DC-8 will also carry the Airborne Rain
      Mapping Radar, from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which matches
      TRMM's Precipitation Radar. This will let the DC-8 stand in for
      TRMM when necessary.</P>

      <P>The only way to correlate remote-sensing measurements with
      what's actually happening inside the storm is to get inside the
      storm. So the Convair 580, Citation, and DC-8 will carry instruments
      into the storms to take a census of rain drops and ice crystals:
      how many are there in what sizes, and what are the winds doing
      to them. The answer will be important to refining computer models
      of rain.

      investigator for the Lightning Imaging Sensor aboard TRMM, but
      on this mission he will use electric field sensors aboard the
      Cessna Citation since little lightning is expected inside the
      storms.</P>

      <P>Anvils (so called for the characteristic shape of these storm
      clouds) in oceanic storms tend to be very long-lived and affect
      the energy of the storm system a great deal. Improved understanding
      is needed so weather forecasters can provide more accurate predictions
      of what will happen around launch areas. For example, launch
      of the Chandra X-ray Observatory was postponed on July 21 because
      of thunderstorms in the area. One of the launch commit criteria
      prohibits a launch if lightning has struck within 20 miles of
      the launch pad in the last 30 minutes. The criterion probably
      is too cautious, but not enough is known to revise it to reduce
      postponements while not increasing the risk of losing a rocket.</P>

      <P>&quot;Anvils were thought to be fairly well understood for
      a long time,&quot; Smith said. But it turns out that the microphysics
      are poorly known, meaning the anvil's life cycle also is poorly
      known. For example, they last days when they shouldn't even last
      hours.</P>

      <P>&quot;Anvils over the ocean are produced by independent complexes
      of convection,&quot; Smith added. &quot;They form and then they
      sit there for many hours and even days at a time. This is a big
      problem in precipitating clouds.&quot; Lightweight microphysics
      aircraft cannot reach the higher altitudes in anvils, so radar
      and electric field sensors are needed.
