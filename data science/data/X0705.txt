cycling race took part from September 8 September 17. The extreme conditions
make this race one of the most difficult ones in the world. It's not only the
altitude (up to 5300m) that makes it so hard, but also the bad road conditions (sometimes
even no road at all), the extreme weather conditions (sun, rain, wind, cold and
even snow), the bad accommodations (military camps with wooden mattresses),
transportations by busses, almost every day (in total over 1600 km with an
average speed of 60km/h) and the unusual Chinese food. This all made it a big
adventure.</span></p>

day we had to get up early because we already had to be at the airport (Beijing)
at 8:00 am to catch our flight to Xining. This city is situated in the
North-West of China at an altitude of 2300m in the Qinghai province. In the
afternoon we could do some training there despite of the rain. But because of
the rain the electricity stopped from working so we spend the most romantic
night there with candlelight. The main benefit for us was that everyone just had
to go to bed early, so we all had a good rest.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">This
day we tried to adapt as much as possible to the high altitude. We did this by
going for an easy ride and spending the rest of the day resting in bed. We only
got out of our beds to do some shopping and for the medical check-up. Sports
doctors from the organisation did this medical check-up to assure everyone's
health for these extreme conditions. As expected there were no health problems
for the Marco Polo team so far, so we all were ready for the big event.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">This
day would be the start of the race. From now on we had to get up at 6:00 am
every morning, because of the early starting time of the stages. After each
stage we had transportation to the next military camp. All these transportations
were really necessary, because it's such a remote area so there are no villages
and towns with hotels.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: NL; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">The
day started with an openings ceremony at the Zhangfang hotel, after which we
first had to get into the busses for over an hour to get to the starting place.
This first stage was 97 km long and it contained a heavy climb with an altitude
difference of 800m. This uphill started after 30 km and the first group of 11
riders that passed this mountain happened to be the decision of the stage. This
group contained 3 Marco Polo riders (Nathan, Jon and Ulzii), 5 Kazakhs and 3
South Africans. In the final sprint of this group Ulzii managed to place himself
in 3rd position after being pushed away by the South Africans twice.
Unfortunately the commissaries didn't punish them despite our protests.<br>
In the evening we enjoyed the great view over Salt Lake Qinghai Hu, which is
very famous for it's seabirds. This huge lake (4500km2) is situated at an
altitude of 3200m.</span></p>

2nd stage was 86 km long at an average altitude of 3400m. The day started rainy
and cold and because of that the organisation decided to delay the start of the
race until the afternoon and they also decided to shorten the stage to a
distance of 68 km. During the race we noticed that the Kazakhs like the cold
because 3 of them were in the breakaway of 6 riders, with 2 South Africans and
Ulzii for Marco Polo. The final sprint again was won by the South Africans but
this time Ulzii finished as 2nd. The main group with the other Marco Polo riders
finished 1 minute behind the leaders so they didn't loose that much for the team
classification.<br>
We were lucky to stay in a good 'hotel' in a touristy village at the west side
of the lake called Bird Island, so we were able to dry our clothing and having a
shower. Between 9:00 pm and 10:00 pm the shower even provided hot water!</span></p>

3rd stage was 78 km long and went away from the lake more towards the west to
Chaka. According to the tour book it would go up gradually to 3600m. During the
race we soon found out that this wasn't trough, because after 10 km a
never-ending ascent started to an altitude of 4200m. At the summit there was a
breakaway of 7. Along them were Ulzii and Jon for Marco Polo, but unfortunately
Jon got dropped during the descent so he ended up in de<br>
2nd group. Ulzii managed to stay in the 1st group where no one could force a
serious attack. Again, the stage was decided by a sprint and this time Ulzii was
way too fast for the others, so it was an easy win for him.<br>
Because of this result Ulzii also became the new leader of the race. In the
afternoon we had another transportation, so again we spend the whole afternoon
on the bus. At night we arrived at a military station. The foreigners weren't
allowed to pass the gate, but soon we heard from other teams that there was an
Internet café near the station, so finally we also took off and had an exciting
night, because we had to watch out for soldiers. But, of course, no one took
notice of us.</span></p>

day was filled with 410 km transportation. Along the way we were able to see the
most magnificent sceneries. We passed a dessert, some rough rocky mountains and
we went across a dried salt lake. We had a delay of one hour because one of the
busses got of the road and almost crashed. After this accident a truck had to
pull the bus out of the sand again. The good part of it is that we were able to
make some nice pictures.</span></p>

We soon noticed to be back again in a real city, because we found an Internet
café again. There we got the terrible news about the plane crashes of the day
before in the USA.<br>
Despite of everything we still went training in the afternoon. We went to the
south (the only good road) where we had a great view over the Kunlun Mountains
that were in front of us. After the training we had another medical check-up and
again we were all well adapted to the high altitude.<br>
At night we found some kind of fair. At a shooting-gallery we gave our
Uzbekistan rider Damir a rifle with which he had to shoot some targets and he
broke all the records, so that night he has beaten the whole Chinese army. After
that I went to play some pool in the streets with Rutger and the Mongolian
coach. After that it was time to go to bed again.</span></p>

rolling course at an average altitude of 3500m. The Marco Polo team took control
over the race so nobody was able to get away. Unfortunately the final kilometre
turned out to be 1500 m so Ulzii started sprinting to early. Still he managed to
finish as 5th. Again the South Africans won the stage. Later this 5th place of
Ulzii turned out to be the decision of the race. For the first time there wasn't
transportation in the afternoon so we were free to do what we wanted.&nbsp;
First we went to see the course of the next day's stage and after that we have
been riding on some camels, a great experience.&nbsp; After that excitement we

the stage ended with a bunch sprint. Unfortunately Ulzii got a flat tire during
that sprint but still he managed to finish as 11th while Jon finished as 6th.
The Kazakhs pushed their main rider during the sprint like<br>
they do on a track. They already did the same the day before so the South
Africans and we protested against that sprint. But again the commissaries didn't
change the results, so Assan Bassayev took over the leading position from Ullzi.
The result of this all was an optimal motivated Marco Polo team for the next
stages.<br>
In the afternoon we again had transportation, this time of 290 km, but from now
on the riders put their helmets on during the bus ride.<br>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">This
was the day of the 6th stage. For us an important stage because after this stage
there was only one more stage to go (the final stage to Lhasa) and we wanted to
enter Lhasa with the yellow jersey! After 100km transportation the 6th stage
started. It was 85 km long at an average altitude of 4600m. The Marco Polo team
kept attacking with the South Africans and<br>
about half way a group of 10 riders got away, amongst them Ulzii and Lex for the
Marco Polo team. For the final sprint Assan Bassayev stayed close to Ulzii's
rearwheel. As planned Lex managed to get between them so Ulzii could sprint
without being blocked and managed to finish as 2nd. Lex finished as 9th but got
disqualified. Now Ulzii was leader because of his better stage results.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">During
the final stage to Lhasa we had to defend Ulzii's leading position. In the
beginning of the stage we surprised the Kazakhs, so a group of 15 got away. This
group contained all the Marco Polo riders, 5 South Africans, 2 Mongolians, 1
American and only 2 Kazakhs.&nbsp; For us an ideal situation. Than we were told
aver the radio that the road in front of us was broken but they would try to
repair it before we would arrive at that place. Than, suddenly, after an
off-road down hill every one stopped. Rutger and I immediately got out of the
car to see what was going on. When we started running we realised that the
asphalt still was soft and warm. This meant cleaning the tires with a knife and
change the wheels as quickly as possible. After a short break the race started
again with all the riders in the same positions.<br>
With only 15 more kilometres to go 3 riders got away from the front group,
Nathan, 1 African and a Mongolian. Now the Kazakhs had to chase because they
needed a good stage result to win the overall. Later even more riders managed to
get away from that group. Nathan finished as 3rd behind the South African and
the Mongolian. Jon finished as 8th, and Damir 9th. The 13th place of Ulzii was
good enough to win the overall, because Assan Basayev only finished as 12th.</span></p>

the stage we had a closing ceremony in the centre of Lhasa near the Potala
Palace. This again was an impressive happening.<br>
In the evening we got together with the Kazakhs and had a great party with them,
first in the hotel with the organisers of the race and later in the disco.<br>
The next day we went to visit Potala Palace and we looked around in the city of
Lhasa. After that we needed to pack again and leave back to The Netherlands.
This for sure was an unforgettable experience.</span></p>
