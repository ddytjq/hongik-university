  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>LOANCARE</b></font>
  <br>
  Affordable Protection Against Accident, Sickness and Unemployment.
  <br><br>
  
  The purchase of your new home is probably the biggest and most exciting financial transaction of your life. Yet your excitement may be tinged a little by the worry of your family finances being
  stretched or indeed lost, in the unfortunate event of your being made unemployed, having an accident or becoming sick.
  <br><br>
  
  Although help with your mortgage payments exists through the Income Support System, this is limited. If you are eligible for Income Support, you are unlikely to receive any assistance from the State for the first 9 months of the claim and when help is available it may not cover all your mortgage related outgoings.
  <br><br>
  
  Recognising these concerns and the restrictions of the Income Support system we have negotiated a scheme with Norwich Union Insurance which can meet your monthly mortgage commitments for up to 12 months in the event of you becoming unemployed or your inability to work due to an accident or sickness.
  <br><br>
  
  Our Loancare policy meets, and in some areas exceeds, the baseline standards agreed by lenders and insurers for this type of product. Therefore, you can be assured that the policy offers value for money and is suitable for your needs.
  <br><br>
  
  We consider Loancare provides valuable protection and strongly recommend that you consider taking out this protection. Where you consider Loancare is not required be careful not to be over optimistic about your ability to meet your mortgage and other commitments.
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>Do I Qualify?</b></font>
  <br>
  To qualify for Cover you must meet the following conditions:
  <ul>
    <li>have a mortgage or further advance with the Society
    <li>be aged 18 or over and under 65
    <li>live in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man
    <li>be working at your employment and have been so continuously for six months immediately prior to the start date of the policy. If you are on holiday or statutory maternity leave from your employment, you will still meet this condition.
  </ul>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>JOINT MORTGAGES:</b></font>
  <br>
  Cover is available for borrowers with a joint mortgage, but each person must meet the above conditions. For joint mortgages, cover can apply to:
  <ul>
    <li>the main income earner only, or
    <li>both borrowers, in which case the monthly benefit will be proportioned to the ratio of incomes at the time the mortgage agreement is signed.
  </ul>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>What if I am Self-Employed?</b></font>
  <br>
  Self-employed persons are eligible to apply for cover. To make a claim for unemployment you must provide evidence that you stopped work because you could not find enough work to meet all reasonable business and living expenses, and declared this to the Inland Revenue.
  <br><br>
  
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>What Options Are Available?</b></font>
  <br>
  We have tailored the cover to suit a wide range of personal circumstances, so even if you have accident and sickness cover from your employer or a substantial level of savings, were are confident that one of the following will meet your needs. The cost depends on which options you choose and the premiums are payable monthly by direct debit from your current account.

  <br>
  You are free to choose the amount of your monthly benefit. As a rule this should represent your monthly mortgage payment and related insurance premiums (such as life assurance, home insurance and the premium for this protection), rounded up to the next £10 multiple. You may also take an additional 20% of the above to cover future increases in these costs. The maximum monthly benefit is £1,250.
  <br><br>

  Using this example with ‘Total Cover Available’ of £390.00 If you chose Option 1 the monthly cost would be £5.58 x 3.9 = £21.75 per month.
  <br><br>
  
  If you select Option 5 the monthly cost will be £3.35 x 3.9 = £13.07 per month.
  <br><br>
  *lf you apply for this protection within 3 months following the release of funds, we will pay your first 3 months premiums for this protection.

  <br>
  Cover is available within 3 months of your funds being released if you want to take advantage of the 3 months free premium offer. Alternatively cover can be taken at a later date but the offer of 3 months free premium will not be available.
