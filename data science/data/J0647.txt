<h1>Vasser coasts to IndyCar Aussie Grand Prix victory</h1>

SURFERS PARADISE, Australia -- Pole-sitter Jimmy Vasser led all but five laps to win Sunday's IndyCar Australia Grand Prix. <p>
Vasser, driving a Reynard-Honda, finished the 12-turn, 2.794-mile road course ahead of fellow American Scott Pruett, in a Lola Ford, to win the second race of his five-year career and the season. Vasser, who vaulted ahead of Pruett in the IndyCar standings, was a winner at the Grand Prix of Miami on March 3.<p>
Rookie Greg Moore of Canada piloted his Reynard Mercedes-Benz to is first podium finish of his IndyCar career, finishing third. Moore was the Indy Lights champion last year.<p>
It was the third win in three races for Honda-powered cars -- Vasser won at Miami and Andre Ribeiro at Rio de Janeiro. <p>
Pruett, who had qualified second in his Patrick Racing Lola-Ford, was 7.75 seconds behind Vasser while third place went to 20-year-old rookie Canadian Greg Moore in his Player's Reynard-Mercedes. <p>
Vasser lost the lead only when he stopped early for his first pit stop. <p>
Mauricio Gugelmin took fourth place, followed by countryman Christian Fittipaldi in fifth. <p>
There was a near-disaster in the pits when a raised tank of methanol tipped over during a Bryan Herta pit stop. Pit workers from Herta's team and others on either side threw large buckets of water to put out the ensuing fire and a member of Herta's team was slightly injured in the incident. <p>
Defending champion Paul Tracy of Canada was put out of the race on the 16th lap when Michael Andretti braked hard on a turn and hit Tracy, forcing the Canadian into the wall and out of the race. When officials could not restart his car and Tracy emerged from the cockpit, Tracy shook his fist at Andretti when the American went past. <p>
&quot;I was doing well, conserving well and then Michael locks up and hits me from behind,'' Tracy said. &quot;It was disappointing for me and disappointing for the team.'' <p>
Andretti, who went out of the race on the 38th lap with electrical problems, said: &quot;I feel bad for him because when I got there my brakes locked up and I had to go for it. I was hoping he wouldn't hit me but he did. It definitely wasn't on purpose.'' <p>
Emerson Fittipaldi, the 1992 champion, had early engine problems and lasted only eight laps, while Parker Johnston of the United States went out on the 10th after hitting a tire barrier. Adrian Fernandez made contact with the wall on the 14th lap, also forcing him out of the race. <p>
Italian rookie Alex Zanardi, who started third in the grid, went out on the 31st lap with gearbox problems, while Bobby Rahal went out with transmission troubles as well. <p>
&quot;We had problems with the gearbox on Friday, but we weren't able to solve them in time,'' said Zanardi. <p>
The first lap of the race was run under a caution when an anxious Vasser, who had never led a field before, pulled too far ahead of the field and a fair start could not be achieved. <p>
On Saturday, Vasser had captured his first pole position in 58 career races and smashed the street course lap record, giving his team its first road course pole win. <p>
Vasser, who won at Miami after qualifying third, broke the record -- on his final lap and with only 30 seconds left in the session -- set only minutes before by Pruett, who had led all qualifiers Friday. <p>
His last-minute heroics prevented Pruett, who won last year's Marlboro 500 -- his first IndyCar win -- from taking his first pole in 77 career starts.<p><hr>
