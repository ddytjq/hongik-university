<H2>Hierarchical Clustering from n=-2 Fluctuations</H2><P>
<I> Last modified 5/16/01. </I>
<P>

These simulations, like the n=0 ones on the <A HREF="n=0.html">previous
page</A>, assume Omega=1 and a scale-free power spectrum of initial
density fluctuations, P(k) proportional to k**n.  In this case, however,
n=-2, implying much more power on large scales relative to small scales.
This difference is apparent in the pattern of clustering visible in
the graphics shown below.  Although physical processes in the real
universe would modify any primeval scale-free power spectrum, for
most realistic models n <= -2 on the scale of galaxies and below.
Gravitational clustering under these conditions is challenging to study
because the relatively large amount of power on large scales leads to
rapid growth of the nonlinear clustering scale.  Because they are
predicted to evolve in a statistically self-similar manner, scale-free
models provide an excellent setting in which to develop and test
analytic theories of strongly nonlinear gravitational clustering.

Zooming in on a n=-2 PM simulation (440 KB) </A> <P>

N=256**3 particles were followed on a 512**3 mesh using
the parallel particle-mesh algorithm on the CM-5 at
<A HREF="http:www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">NCSA</A>.  The upper left
panel shows a projection of the mass density of the entire
simulation.  Successive magnifications by a factor of 4 are
shown going clockwise.  To reduce the graininess caused by
finite particle number, the images have been smoothed to a
resolution of 1/1280 of the full cube (20 pixels in the
highest-magnification panel).  Colors represent the logarithm
of projected density, ranging from the cosmic mean density (dark
blue) to a value 50 times larger (white).  (The peak three-dimensional
density is nearly a million times the cosmic mean.)  The model has
been evolved 27 expansion factors.

Zooming in on a n=-2 P3M simulation (440 KB) </A> <P>

This simulation was identical to the pm simulation shown above, except
that the parallel particle-particle/particle-mesh (p3m) method
was used, resulting in about 10 times better spatial resolution.
The softening length is 10 pixels in the highest-magnification
panel (1/5120 of the size of the simulation cube).  The differences
between this image and the one above are due to the higher force
resolution of the p3m simulation.  The simulation was performed on
the CM-5 at NCSA.  More than 1300 timesteps were taken and energy was
conserved to better than 0.01%.  The simulation is continuing, so watch
out for later images.

Time evolution of gravitational clustering (Mpeg, 4.29 MB)</A>
<P>

N=128**3 particles were used in this adaptive p3m (p3m2) simulation
of the n=-2 model performed on the Convex C-3880 at NCSA.  The initial
conditions are a different realization of the gaussian random field
from the two simulations shown above, but they are statistically similar.
The animation is a projection through the entire cube of an area 1/8 by
1/8 centered on one of the densest groups to form.  During the animation
the universe expands by a factor of 32, although the view is shown in
comoving coordinates factoring out the mean expansion.  The force
softening length is 1/2560 of the cube.  The simulation used 1400 timesteps
to this point and conserved energy to about 1%.

Time evolution of gravitational clustering (AVI, 2.4 MB)</A>
<P>

This animation is made from the much larger, N=256**3 simulation described
above.  A total of 2199 timesteps were used.  Unlike the preceding
animation, this one is presented in proper coordinates and shows
the Hubble expansion following the big bang.  The timeline is scaled
to proper time and the spatial coordinates are proper.  The universe
expands by a factor of about 90 during this animation, so at the end
we are looking at a small cluster of dark matter halos while the rest
of the simulated universe has "moved off screen".

Time evolution of gravitational clustering (AVI, WARNING! 18 MB)</A>
<P>

This is the same animation as the preceding one, except shown at
higher resolution.  It is large (18 MB) and may take a long time to
download - don't try this over a phone line!
