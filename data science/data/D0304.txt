<h2>About the Tutorial</h2>
</a>
<blockquote>

<a name="what">
<strong>What is "the Java Tutorial"?</strong>
</a>
<p>
The Java Tutorial is a programmer's guide for the Java platform.
It has two forms:
<ol>
<li>
The <a href="../index.html">online</a> version--A hyperlinked,
interactive, set of HTML pages available on the World-Wide Web.
<li>
The book--The first edition of <em>The Java(tm) Tutorial</em>
was published in the summer of 1996 and covers JDK 1.0.2.
The second edition covers JDK 1.1. The third edition covers 
version 1.3 and is now available in bookstores.
</ol>

<hr>

<a name="where">
<strong>Where can I get the tutorial?</strong>
</a>
<p>
You can read the tutorial online. Start at the trail map:

sometimes months pass between updates.
Frequently we'll make minor fixes to individual pages
without updating the whole tutorial.

<a name="accolades">
<strong>What awards has the tutorial won?</strong>
</a>

<p>
On February 21st, 1998 the Northern California branch of the Society for
Technical Communications (STC) announced their awards.
The first edition of <em>The Java Tutorial</em> won a Merit Award in the
category "Single-Issue Publications" (better known as retail books).

<h2>About Downloading the Tutorial</h2>
</a>
<blockquote>
<p>
<a name="howdownload">
<strong>How do I download the tutorial?</strong>
</a>
<p>
See
<a href="download.html">Download the Tutorial</a>
for information. Unfortunately,
we cannot send the tutorial to individuals
via e-mail.
<p>
If for some reason, you cannot download the tutorial from
the web, consider <a href="#buy">buying the book</a> and using the version
of the tutorial contained on the CD included with the book.
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong>
If you download the tutorial, feel free to make it available
locally at your site. <em>Please do not publicly mirror
it to the Web!</em>.
See the
<a href="#mirroring">next question and answer</a> to find out why.

<p>
<hr>
<a name="mirroring">
<strong>May I mirror the tutorial publicly?</strong>
</a>
<p>
Our policy on distribution is that 
anyone is permitted have a copy of the online
tutorial as long as it's visible <em>only</em> within their own institution
(university, business, or whatever) and no one is profiting from the
tutorial's distribution.
<p>
We've taken this strict position because the many tutorial mirrors
mean that search engines generally
don't find the most up-to-date version of the tutorial.
Instead, search engines find mirror sites,
which invariably fall behind.
We end up getting e-mail about problems that have been
corrected in newer versions of the tutorial. Or perhaps worse, we
don't get e-mail and the reputation of the tutorial suffers. We allow
local copies because we realize that browsing java.sun.com isn't always
practical.
<p>
When you 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/forms/sendusmail.html">tell us about a mirror,</a>
we send the offender a friendly e-mail
asking them to please move their copy of the tutorial
to a place that isn't visible from the outside world.

<strong>I'm having trouble unarchiving the tutorial. What should I do?</strong>
</a>
<p>
Many readers can solve this problem by installing or updating 
software to unarchive compressed files (like Zip files). 
For example, on the Win32 platform (including Windows 95/98/NT), 
you can use <a href="http://www.winzip.com/">WinZip</a> to unarchive the Tutorial.

<h2>About Getting the Tutorial in Other Formats</h2>

<blockquote>

<strong>Can I get the tutorial in WinHelp format?</strong>

<p>
Yes.

<strong>Can I get a PostScript or PDF version of the tutorial to download?</strong>
</a>
<p>
No.
If you want a hard copy of the tutorial,
you can <a href="#buy">buy or borrow the book</a>.
To find out why, read the <a href="#postscript">next question and answer</a>.

<p>
<hr>
<a name="postscript">
<strong>Why isn't the tutorial available in PostScript or PDF?</strong>
</a>
<p>

We used to offer a PostScript version of the tutorial,
but it caused many more problems than
it solved.
There were problems with fonts, page size in Europe, 
older versions of PostScript, and so on.
PDF format might solve some or all of those problems,
but we also got a lot of complaints 
about the actual document: "it's just a PostScript dump of the HTML,"
"the links don't make sense on paper," and so on.
PDF wouldn't solve those problems.
As a result, we no longer provide PostScript,
and we won't be providing it
or PDF in the future.

<strong>Khwarazm and Me?  Who are they?</strong>
</a>
<p>
<em>Khwarazm</em> and <em>me</em> are FrameMaker's suggested respellings
of Kathy and Mary's login names.
For a long time,
we had no idea what <em>Khwarazm</em> meant,
but several readers wrote in to educate us.
Khwarazm is the name both of a Central Asian city
(now Khiva, Uzbekistan) and of a Persian mathematician
born in that city around 780 A.D.
The mathematician, Mohammed ibn-Musa al Khwarazm,
is credited with introducing
the Hindu Arabic decimal number system to the West,
and the concept of zero into Arab mathematics.
The term <em>algebra</em> is taken
from part of the title (<em>al-jabr</em>)
of one of his books.
The word "algorithm"
is derived from his name,
which is alternately spelled al-Khwarizmi
and al Khawrizm.
