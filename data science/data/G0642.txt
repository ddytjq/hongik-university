<H1>Black Holes and Critical Phenomena</H1>
 <P>
A scalar field is a simple form of matter which feels two forces only,
gravity produced by itself, and its own pressure.  If you try to build
a ball in which the field is initially weak, pressure wins and the
ball expands away leaving nothing behind.  If the field is initially
strong gravity wins and the ball collapses to form a <a href =
"bh_intro.html">black hole</a>

<p>
There is a special critical initial strength such that the field
cannot decide whether to evaporate away or collapse to form a black
hole.  Instead it oscillates increasingly rapidly, performing an
infinite number of oscillations in a finite time.  The two animations
show first an evolution which doesn't form a black hole, and second an
evolution which does.  The initial strengths differ only by one in the
fifteenth decimal place.  Each frame shows the scalar field as a
function of position.  The gravitational field changes the frequency
of the field and so the colour indicates what a distant observer would
see.

<p>
Because the animation moves so quickly it is hard to see what is
happening.  The next picture summarises the animations.

Time is increasing from left to right (downwards).

<p>
Radius is increasing from left to right (upwards).

The colour indicates the curvature of spacetime.  Far away (back of
picture) the spacetime is almost flat (blue) while on the axis the
field is becoming stronger and stronger (red turning black).  Although
there are an infinite number of oscillations in a finite time, all
bunched up on each other, we have stretched out the time coordinate to
separate them.

The next group of figures show the paths of photons emitted from the
axis.  Each blue line in the left picture represents a photon path.
Radius is plotted horizontally and time vertically.  Thus photons
emitted at late times have higher lines in the figure.  In the first
picture there is some fine detail near the axis.  the second increases
the scale by one thousand, and the third by a further one thousand.
Here you can see that all the photons escape.

The next set are the same photon paths but for the case where a black
hole forms.  At the finest resolution you can see that photons emitted
at late times stop moving outwards and return back towards the axis.
This is the moment at which the black hole forms.

This is an enlargement of the region where the black hole forms.

In the next picture we superpose the evolutions with (red) and without
(green) black hole formation.  At early times (bottom of the picture)
the spacetimes differ only in the fifteenth decimal place.  Once the
spacetime decides what to do, the solutions then bifurcate.
