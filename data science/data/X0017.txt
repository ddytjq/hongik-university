<FONT size=+1>The technology of snowmaking, which most modern American ski resorts depend on to surface their ski trails in good winters and bad, is a native New England invention that was designed by three skiers fed up with the lack of snow on the trails at Mohawk Mountain in Cornwall, CT. That is one of the many stories told in a new exhibit at the New England Ski Museum.<P>

<B>This rope tow at Bousquet's<BR>
in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, was<BR>
installed in the winter of 1935-36.<BR>
After a ski train visited his farm<BR>
in 1935, Clare Bousquet, a self-<BR>
taught building and mechanical<BR>
contractor, devised a more<BR>
sophisticated tow than those at<BR>
Shawbridge and Woodstock<BR>
using machinery salvaged from<BR>
idle paper mills. This tow had a<BR>
tower with a counterweight to<BR>
allow for the shrinking and<BR>
stretching of the rope under<BR>
different conditions, a refinement<BR>
not seen at Woodstock or Gilford.<BR>
Bousquet also introduced an early<BR>
safety gate, perhaps the first, at<BR>
the lift's top terminal; this would<BR>
shut down the motor if a skier<BR>
failed to let go of the rope at the<BR>
proper point, preventing accidents<BR>
at the upper bullwheel.<BR></B>

<I>Technology of Alpine Skiing: Lifts, Grooming and Snowmaking</I> opened this spring, fifty years after the first demonstration snowmaking systems were installed at Mohawk Mountain and Big Boulder, PA. The exhibit features the inventions that have changed alpine skiing from an informal backyard winter sport like sledding to a capital-intensive industry with resorts that operate sophisticated lifts, surface 100% of their trails with man-made snow, and groom their ski trails intensively with highly-engineered snow tractors and grooming attachments.<P>

<B>Looking down the lift line<BR>
of the first chairlift in<BR>
the eastern US, and<BR>
the fourth in the country,<BR>
at Gilford, New Hampshire.<BR>
A summer accident on<BR>
this lift in the mid 1950s<BR>
helped spark the creation<BR>
of the New Hampshire<BR>
Tramway Safety Board, the<BR>
first of its kind in the nation.<BR>
Phil Robertson, the promotor<BR>
of the overhead cable lift<BR>
at Moody's in Jackson and<BR>
later manager of Cranmore<BR>
and advocate of the monorail<BR>
lift at Attitash, was chairman<BR>
of the early Tramway Safety<BR>
Board. Most states in ski<BR>
country followed New<BR>
Hampshire's lead, creating<BR>
state safety codes and<BR>
national standards governing<BR>
the operation of the various<BR>
kinds of ski lifts.<BR></B>

Unlike snowmaking, ski lifts, snow tractors and  grooming implements were not invented specifically for ski areas by skiers, but were borrowed from older, existing technology. The basic concept of the aerial tramway is shown in the exhibit in a 1644 woodcut of  a ropeway in Danzig, Poland. Chairlifts were developed in 1936            for the new Sun Valley, ID ski resort by an engineer who had seen a cable contraption designed to unload bananas from freighters. Oversnow vehicles invented in the 1940s and earlier by E.M. Tucker of Oregon and J. A. Bombardier of Valcourt, Quebec were pressed into service by ski areas to pull implements based on agricultural attachments to condition their ski slopes.<P>

The rope tow became popular in the early 1930s as tows in Shawbridge,Quebec, Woodstock, VT and Lisbon and Gilford NH opened. By the 1935-36 season, two tows using overhead wire rope instead of manilla rope were installed at Moody's Farm in Jackson, NH and Oak Hill in Hanover, NH. The Oak Hill J-bar was studied by the engineers working on the Sun Valley chairlift, which opened the next ski season. One year later, the first chairlift in the east began operation at Mt. Belknap, Gilford, NH.<P>

<B>Cranmore's Magic Carpet in use,<BR>
probably in the early 1940s. The<BR>
chain link mat had ice caulks<BR>
designed for use on horseshoes<BR>
on the underside to help break up<BR>
crust. By all accounts the<BR>
implement did a fairly good job,<BR>
and its flexibility allowed it to<BR>
work in small hollows and rolls.<BR></B>

Mount Cranmore in North Conway, NH and Bromley in Manchester, VT were early leaders in ski area grooming. At Cranmore, manager Phil Robertson devised a system for improving different types of snow conditions in the early 1940s using slatted wooden rollers, chain link mat drags, and spot treatment with calcium chloride to melt and re-freeze snow to underlying rock. Bromley's owner Fred Pabst, Jr, heir to the brewing family, had known Cranmore's Hannes Schneider in Austria in the 1920s, and the two stayed in touch and used similar methods to maintain smooth, grassy summer slopes at their areas that could open with minimal amounts of snow.<P>

While snow tractors were manufactured outside the region by Tucker (OR), Bombardier (Quebec) and Thiokol (UT), New Englanders developed some of the best-known grooming attachments. Otto Wallingford of Lost Valley, Auburn, ME was an agricultural engineer-turned ski area owner who came up with the expanded-steel roller called the Powder Maker, and the front-mounted U-blade that he fitted onto the early Thiokol Spryte tractor. When Wallingford took his early Powder Maker to Sugarloaf, ME for testing in 1968, he knew he had a saleable product when the ski area wouldn't return it, so he went into business as Valley Engineering to manufacture grooming attachments.<P>

<B>Tucker distributor Bob Smith<BR>
of Ed-Gil Distributors built<BR>
implements, and fitted<BR>
some Tuckers sold in the<BR>
east with a blade mounted<BR>
amidships, inspired by road<BR>
graders. The operator<BR>
typically removed the front<BR>
floorboards on the right side<BR>
to be able to observe the<BR>
blade in operation. A few<BR>
years later Valley Engineering<BR>
blades were put on the front<BR>
of Tuckers, but it was not an<BR>
effective solution due to the<BR>
Tucker's long frame and<BR>
light weight.<BR></B>

The initial snowmaking systems were fraught with problems caused by freeze-ups and high air and water pressure. One early installation at Bousquet's in Pittsfield, MA simply exploded the first day it was charged. It wasn't until 1964, when Bristol Mountain, NY installed a system with buried pipes and freeze-proof yard hydrants insulated with cow manure, that the freezing problem began to be addressed.<P>

<B>The men behind the Tey Manufacturing<BR>
Company, Wayne Pierce (L), Dave<BR>
Richey and Art Hunt (R), look over<BR>
their original snow gun at Mohawk<BR>
Mountain, Connecticut. The three<BR>
manufactured aluminum skis,<BR>
bindings, and Tey-Tape, a<BR>
bottom surface for skis. They<BR>
skied at Mohawk, reportedly<BR>
on the 1950 weekend when<BR>
crushed ice surfaced some<BR>
slopes, and knew owner Walt<BR>
Schoenknecht. Tey's snowmaking<BR>
guns and pipes and pumps from<BR>
Larchmont Farms were combined<BR>
into the first commercial snow-<BR>
making system by Schoenknecht<BR>
at Mohawk in  1951. "The machine,<BR>
which works on the principle of a<BR>
giant atomizer, mixes air and<BR>
water under heavy pressure,<BR>
forming a vapor cloud seeded<BR>
to crystalize as snow. Mohawk's<BR>
nine-tow area is criss-crossed<BR>
with two miles of four-inch<BR>
aluminum pipe and a mile of<BR>
green plastic hose in varying<BR>
diameters", reported Eastern<BR>
Skier. The system cost $25,000<BR>
and could develop 3,000 cubic<BR>
feet per minute of compressed<BR>
air. By comparison, one modern<BR>
western snowmaking system<BR>
generates 700,000 cubic feet<BR>
per minute.<BR></B>

The exhibit includes photos of some of the ski area solutions that didn't see the future, like the Mt Hood, OR tramway made from city busses, the proposed cog monorail at Attitash, NH, the Mittersill, NH snowcat-mounted spray rig designed to ice ski trails, and the Sno-Vac, which vacuumed snow from nearby woods and deposited it, along with plenty of leaf debris, on ski trails.<P>

The Ski Museum exhibit runs through March 31, 2002. The Museum is open daily from 12 PM to 5 PM through October 14, and from December 1 to March 31, 2002. The Museum, located at the base of the Cannon Mountain Tramway in Franconia Notch State Park, also features a theater where documentary films on the history of skiing are shown and a museum shop with vintage ski poster reproductions, historic ski videos, the best selection of ski history books in the country, and ski-related gifts. All purchases help support the Museum's ongoing programs.<P>
