The funny thing about black holes is that they're very rarely seen at all.
There's usually all this <i>stuff</i> surrounding 'em.  That makes sense,
when you think about it.  Black holes form either from stars or from a lot
of matter being in one place.  Old, large, black-hole-candidate-sized
stars usually have a lot of their outer atmosphere floating around them
when they collapse; and just because a black hole formed from some matter
doesn't mean it used up <i>all</i> the matter in its formation.  Besides,
the universe is a very dirty place---all the stars you see and all of
those you don't were formed by dust and gas.  So.  There is dust and gas
around the black holes.  I can imagine astronomers hold grudges against
the dust in our own galaxy that prevents us from seeing the core of the
milky way galaxy---so, don't underestimate the power of dust to conceal
something interesting!
<p>
What, am I getting side-tracked?  What does this dust have to do with
anything, I can see you want to ask.  This dust that happens to be around
a black hole will eventually be disturbed by the black hole.  I won't say
that it will all fall in, for black holes aren't terribly efficient for
"cleaning" up the universe.  Still, there's all this dust revolving around
the black hole.  Not only is it revolving, but it is doing so at
tremendous speeds!  Why should it go so fast, and why shouldn't it just
tumble in instead of forming yon great mucking disk?  There's this thing
in physics called gravitational energy.  The higher up in a gravitational
field, the more gravitational energy something has.
<p>
Take a bit of dust way above a black hole.  It's got <i>a lot</i> of
gravitational energy.  Say that the piece of dust is starting to fall
towards the black hole.  It is now lower in a gravitational field, so it
must have less gravitational energy.  Where did that energy go?  Well,
some of the energy changed into kinetic energy, and the bit of dust sped
up, which means it follows some kind of shrinking, erratic (precessing, I
believe it's called), elliptical orbit.  Some of the energy also went into
heat.  Hot objects radiate light, from a hot stove emitting infrared to a
hot poker emitting visible light.  The friction between the bit of dust
and the other bits of dust around the black hole translates into more heat
and more light being emitted.  After a while the bit of dust starts to
visibly glow.  It falls some more, and soon it gets so hot that it emits
x-rays.  Astronomers have telescopes that scan the sky for x-ray sources
and have found no few black holes that way.
<p>
So, that's why it goes so fast.  But, what about the disk shape?  Wouldn't
it make sense for stuff to form a sphere around the black hole?  Well,
consider this: most black holes rotate just because it's very difficult to
get things in this universe to <i>stop</i> moving.  That and it's quite
difficult to tell whether something is completely sessile or whether it's
just stopped moving relative to you.  It also has to do with the structure
of <a href="rotating.html">rotating black holes<img
src="../media/inside.jpg"
align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10"></a>.  There's this ellipsoid (three
dimensional oval) around the black hole called the ergosphere (the dark
purple area in the picture to the right), and it connects with the black
hole's outer event horizon at the poles of its axis of rotation.  Got that
image in your head?  It's a lot like a squished orange on a stick: the
peel billows out and connects with the pulp where the stick punctured
the orange.  Something like that, you see.
<p>
ANYway, in the area where the accretion disk forms is the ergosphere at
its fullest.  At the two poles of the black hole there is no ergosphere
(that or it's too tiny to matter) and there is just the outer event
horizon.  Stuff in the ergosphere starts moving with the rotation of the
black hole (it can't not move, that's the power of the ergosphere).  So,
the dust in the ergosphere moves faster than the stuff at the poles, which
means it takes longer for it to cross the event horizon.  Stuff at the
poles crosses the event horizon sooner than it would have had it been at
the equator.  Naturally, a disk forms.  Ta-dah!
<h1>What about those two jets?</h1>
With all the dust rushing around the black hole it's not surprising that a
little static electricity might build up around the black hole, too.  When
an electric field moves, it generates a magnetic field.  It's just one of
those physics things.  A magnetic field, so what?  Black holes are
tremendously powerful, and the field it generates is also powerful.
Electrons that were going to fall into the black hole get caught up in
this field.  Another physics thing is that, whenever an electric field
generates a magnetic field, the force of the magnetic field goes in
directions perpendicular to the electric field.  To use a popular teaching
device from my circuits class, the Right-Hand Rule: curve the fingers of
your right hand in the direction of the electric field, and the thumb of
your right hand points in the direction of the magnetic field.
<p>
Those electrons that move in the magnetic field, they streak out along
the axis of rotation, propelled to incredible speeds and energy by the
magnetic field.  They pick up so much energy that they become x-rays and
sometimes even gamma rays!  Gamma rays are the highest-power form light
can take.  The twin jets shooting out from the accretion disk are like
insanely huge fountains of light whipped around and away from the black
hole.  Astronomers can look to those jets to lead 'em back to the black
hole.
<p>
The energy from the accretion disk and the twin energy jets aren't the
only thing a black hole radiates.  There's also...
<a name="hawking"><h1>Hawking radiation</h1>
You can make a black hole out of anything, really, it would just take
tremendous pressure.  That's why the sun could never become one---it
couldn't compress past the pressure of the electrons not wanting to be
close to one another and then past the pressure of the neutrons not
wanting to decompose.  However, if you could compress the sun that much
(IF!), it would shrink down to its Schwarzschild radius and become a small
black hole.  Small black holes such as this theoretical one have very
strong <a href="inside.html#tidal">tidal forces</a>, recall. Famed
astrophysicist <a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/hawking/">Stephen
Hawking</a> knew these facts and more.  He knew that space wasn't really
empty: it was full of virtual particle and antiparticle pairs.  He
realized that the tidal forces of small black holes were strong enough to
tear apart the pair, producing enough energy to make the virtual particle
materialize in real space.  According to this theory, black holes give off
Hawking radiation of particles and antiparticles.  What happens when the
particles "form" inside the event horizon, aren't they trapped there?
Well, not really.  Due to quantum mechanics there is a certain probability
that the particles can <a href="tunnel.html">tunnel</a> through to the
outside universe.
<p>
Since black holes radiate particles, physicists can give 'em a temperature
(albeit a very small one).  This doesn't really matter for the large black
holes (those with a mass of the earth<a
href="breferences.html#sup2"><sup>2</sup></a>), for they do not radiate
many particles and therefore have a temperature that is so frustratingly
close to absolute zero that it's inconsequential<a
href="breferences.html#sup3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Small black holes
radiate more particles by comparison.  Should mercury (the planet,
not the element and not Sailor Mercury) *pwoof* into a black hole, it
would have a temperature of about 10&#176 Kelvin.  Many people find this
quite odd that a black hole, something thought of as only absorbing matter
and never letting anything go, should shine particles like a star.  I
still think it's weird.
<p>
<h1><s>Black holes are forever</s>  The mortal black hole!</h1>
This radiation is the key to the black hole's mortality.  As a black hole
radiates particles and antiparticles, it loses mass. Eh? Well, the energy
it took to materialize the virtual particle come from <i>somewhere</i>. 
The smaller the black hole gets, the more it radiates.  The more it
radiates, the smaller it gets.  People like to call this process
evaporation.  Eventually, it will get so small that it releases massive
amounts of energy and loses mass at an incredible rate.  In the last
second of the black hole's existence, it releases the same energy as
billion one megaton hydrogen bombs would<a
href="breferences.html#sup2"><sup>2</sup></a>.  After this
I've been told that either the black hole ceases to exist or it leaves a
particle with a mass of planck mass (planck's constant being 6.63x10^-34
and perhaps the unit of measure is grams); except, I forget where I read
that bit of information, so it could be chimerical speculation (a fun
phrase to say).
<h1>Black hole energy-generators: the wave of the future!</h1>
Don't laugh, it works much better than anything we've got now!  Okay,
there are two ways to generate energy with a black hole: dumping stuff
into them and throwing stuff near them.  Actually, you can only do the
second with a <a href="rotating.html">rotating black hole</a>; the first
is applicable to any type of black hole.  I consider dumping stuff into a
black hole dangerous, for it only makes the black hole larger.
Eventually, you would have to move your dumping station, or it would be
swallowed by the black hole.
<p>
I should explain how the system works before I criticize it, I imagine.  I
won't go into painful detail about the workings of relativity, so you're
going to have to accept my word on this (or go read up on the topic
yourself to see if I'm right!).  The formula for the energy released by an
object that falls into a black hole is as follows:<br>
E<sub>released</sub> = (mass)(speed of light)<sup>2</sup>[1 - (1 -
R<sub>s</sub>/radius)<sup>1/2</sup>]<br>
It looks complicated enough, but it's kinda simple.  I'm sure you've heard
Einstein's famous equation E = mc<sup>2</sup>.  It just means that the
energy of anything is just the mass times the square of the speed of
light.  The speed of light is a rather large number, 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> to
be precise.  That means there's a lot of energy locked up in matter.
Anyway, the energy unlocked by that matter as it falls in the black hole
is mc<sup>2</sup> times a certain factor describing how close to the black
hole the matter is.
<p>
It has to do with gravitational energy, which I explained when I was
describing an accretion disk.  So, the closer an object gets to a black
hole, the more energy it releases.  How much?  Well, it can't release it
all.  How much energy it releases depends on the R<sub>s</sub>/r factor.
When the object is far away from the black hole, that factor is less than
one.  That means the energy released is only a certain percentage of
mc<sup>2</sup>.  The closer an object gets to the black hole, the closer
it gets to 100&#37.
<p>
Very nice, very mathematical, but how does that generate energy??  Imagine
a <i>really</i> big conveyor belt attached at one end to a generator
station (a station wth big ol' rockets to keep it from moving closer to
the black hole).  At the other end the conveyor belt goes real close to
the black hole (how close depends on how much energy you want to
generate).  Attached to this belt is an electric motor.  What will we be
dumping into the black hole?  Trash.  Nuclear waste.  Those little tabs
from aluminum soda cans.  It doesn't matter, we just dump what we want to
get rid of.  Each time some trash falls into the black hole, the conveyor
belt gives a mighty jerk that turns the generator and generates a
staggering amount of energy.  This process is much more efficient than
using nuclear fission or even fusion and utterly dwarfs the energy
generated by using fossil fuels.  Very clean, very safe energy.
<p>
What if we don't want to make a black hole bigger by throwing stuff in it?
Easy enough, that's the second way to get energy from a black hole.
Imagine a <a href="rotating.html">rotating black hole</a>.  As I explained
up above, there's this area outside of the event horizon called the
ergosphere.  Stuff in the ergosphere has to move with the rotation of the
black hole.  If you put a delicate glass statue in the ergosphere, it
would start moving.  Perchance, since it is glass after all, the statue
breaks in half.  Half falls closer towards the black hole and half flies
out of the ergosphere with a more energy than when it came in.  Where did
the extra energy come from?  What really happened was that the part that
flew out stole rotational energy, kinda like kinetic energy but a little
more complicated.  That made the black hole spin a little slower, though.
At least the event horizon didn't get any bigger.
<p>
<h1>Superradiance</h1>
You don't have to do this process with matter; it also works for light.
Throw a light ray in the ergosphere with a certain energy (say, a visible
light ray), and it comes out of the ergosphere with more energy (say, an
x-ray ray).  The extra energy came from the black hole---it
rotated a little slower after this energy-theft, but it didn't slow down
as much as it would have with the glass statue.  At the price of a little
rotational energy, you can amplify light rays.  This process is called
superradiance.
