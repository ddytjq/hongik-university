Despite the convenience of on-site training courses,
a number of people have said that they simply don't have enough
people to have Marty come in for an on-site servlet and JSP training course. 
So, he periodically offers public courses as well. The next two will be
<A HREF="Public-Short-Course.html">a 4-day short course on basic servlet and JSP
development</A>
April 16-19, 2002 in Northern Virginia (near Washington DC) and
<A HREF="Public-Short-Course2.html">a 4-day short course on advanced servlet and JSP
development</A>
April 23-26, 2002 at the same location.
<I>Class size is limited: four of Marty's previous public servlet and
JSP short courses (Sydney, Australia and Rockville, Maryland) were full.</I>

      Wonderful. In 20 years, this is the best organized, most pragmatic,           
      and enjoyable course I've taken.                                              
      <I>Attendee at 2001 Servlet and JSP Short Course in Maryland</I>

      Best short course ever!                                                       
      <I>Attendee at 2001 Servlet and JSP Short Course in Maryland</I>                                 
      <P>
      Compared to the other short courses I have taken this one completely          
      redefined my scale from 1-10.                                                 
      <I>Attendee at 2001 Servlet and JSP Short Course in Maryland</I>
	  <P>
      I'm not easily pleased by industry courses. Luckily, not all
      presenters are as good as Marty, otherwise University lecturers
      like myself would be out of work. 
	  <I>Attendee at 2000 Servlet and JSP short course in Sydney Australia.</I>
	  <P>
      Marty is a fantastic teacher and communicator. I thoroughly
      enjoyed the course and it was timely for my current work.
	  <I>Attendee at 2000 Servlet and JSP short course in Sydney Australia.</I>
	  <P>
      It was the best way to survey Java servlets and JSP. I enjoyed
      every minute of Marty's interesting and knowledge-filled
      presentations. Standouts were his in-depth knowledge of the 
	  subject matter, accessibility, and genuine passion for Java.
	  <I>Attendee at 2000 Servlet and JSP short course in Rockville.</I>
      <P>
      Totally fantastic, right level, right material.
	  <I>Attendee at 2000 Servlet and JSP short course in Rockville.</I>
	  <P>
      It was an awesome course delivered by an extraordinary man. Yes, I       
      truly admire your in-depth knowledge, approach and ideas.
	  <I>Attendee at 2000 Servlet and JSP short course in Rockville.</I>
	  <P>
      This was the most successful short course that I have taken      
      in the past five years. ... A Great Feat. Keep it up!
	  <I>Attendee at 2000 Servlet and JSP short course in Rockville.</I>
      <P>
      Being a Microsoft Certified Instructor for seven years I 
      definitely give a top point to Marty. Discussions are well controlled,
      they were interesting yet weren't boring. Marty's knowledge is
      incredible.
	  <I>Attendee at 2000 Servlet and JSP short course in Rockville.</I>
      <P>
	  Very well organized starting with servlets leading to an
	  easy transition to JSPs. Good examples to support the topics.
	  <I>Attendee at 2000 Servlet and JSP short course in Rockville.</I>
	  <P>
      Definitely the <U>best</U> computer class I ever took... I do
      not even know how you could have done a better job.<BR>
      <I>Attendee at 1999 Java short course at
      the U.S. Coast Guard Operations System Center in West Virginia.</I>
      <P>
      Masterful, quick-paced presentation. Witty, but never trite. Discussed
      but never belabored. A Java ed-venture. A gaggle of Goslings could not
      have done better!
	  <I>Attendee at 1999 Java short course at
      the U.S. Coast Guard Operations System Center in West Virginia.</I>
      <P>
      Superb! ... Great amount of information, clearly communicated and very
      good interaction with the audience.
	  <I>Attendee at 1999 Java short course at

      <P>
      Knowledge and style were both excellent -- Mr. Hall is among the best
      I have ever met.
	  <I>Attendee at 1999 Java short course at NUWC in Rhode Island.</I>
      <P>
      Marty Hall is outstanding - invite him back! (Ratings: all

	  <I>Attendee at 1999 Java short course at NUWC in Rhode Island.</I>
      <P>
      Good presentation of material geared toward programmers.
      Questions that instructor asked were though provoking and
      resulted in a better understanding of the material ... Knowledge
      excellent, presentation very good, can't think of any way to
      improve. (Ratings: all 5's)

      This was the best class (instructor, style, content) I've ever
      taken in college. Not much to improve upon. (Fall '97)
      <P>
      Outstanding. Best class I've had at JHU. (Fall '97)
      <P>
      Incredible instructor. Learned so much useful stuff that will be
      directly applicable to my job. (Fall '97)
      <P>
      Marty is the best instructor that I've had out of nine classes.
      (Spring '98)
      <P>
      The course is great! Don't change anything! ... Marty Hall is
      the best instructor I've had for a JHU class and one of the best
      instructors I have ever had in any class. (Spring '98)
      <P>
      I see why it's hard to get in the class -- APL wants to save the
      best for last -- excellent class, excellent teacher!
      (Spring '98)
      <P>
      Best instructor I've had at JHU. (Summer '98)
      <P>
      Top notch! Knowledge of material is remarkable. (Summer '98)
      <P>
      Marty is the <U>best</U> teacher I've had at APL. He conveys
      subject matter in a style not unlike Jim Carrey.  (Summer '98)

      It gives me great pleasure to inform you that you have been
      selected as one of three recipients of the 1998 Part-Time
      Programs in Engineering and Applied Science Excellence in
      Teaching Award. This is a very high honor indeed, especially
      when one considers that these programs are the largest of
      their kind in the country. Your selection was based on your
      consistently outstanding performance in the classroom and
      your development of the hugely successful Web course.
      (JHU Dean of Engineering).
      <P>
      You are among the handful of exemplary faculty to whom I am
      sending this letter of gratitude. While this letter and
      recognition by your peers may be important, I hope you will
      take the greatest reward in the recognition that your
      students consistently give you on your evaluations by rating
      you as one of our best instructors. (Chairman of part-time
