The inner ear:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The auditory and vestibular systems are intimatelyconnected.  The receptors for both are located in the temporalbone, in a convoluted chamber called the <B>bony labyrinth</B>. A delicate continuous membrane is suspended within the bony labyrinth,creating a second chamber within the first.  This chamber is calledthe <B>membranous labyrinth</B>.  The entire fluid-filled structureis called the <B>inner ear</B>. <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The inner ear has two membrane-covered outlets intothe air-filled <B>middle ear</B> - the <B>oval window</B> andthe <B>round window</B>.  The oval window is filled by the plateof the <B>stapes</B>, the third middle ear bone.  The stapes vibratesin response to vibrations of the eardrum, setting the fluid ofthe inner ear sloshing back and forth.  The round window servesas a pressure valve, bulging outward as pressure rises in theinner ear.<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="aud1.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The oval window opens into a large central area withinthe inner ear called the <B>vestibule</B>.  All of the inner earorgans branch off from this central chamber.  On one side is the<B>cochlea</B>, on the other the <B>semicircular canals</B>. The <B>utricle</B> and <B>saccule</B>, additional vestibular organs,are adjacent to the vestibule.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The membranous labyrinth is filled with a specialfluid called <B>endolymph</B>.  Endolymph is very similar to intracellularfluid: it is high in potassium and low in sodium.  The ionic compositionis necessary for vestibular and auditory hair cells to functionoptimally.  The space between the membranous and bony labyrinthsis filled with <B>perilymph</B>, which is very much like normalcerebral spinal fluid.  <BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>B.  Auditory transduction:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The transduction of sound into a neural signal occursin the cochlea.  If we were to unroll the snail-shaped cochlea,it would look like this:</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="aud2.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">As the stapes vibrates the oval window, the perilymphsloshes back and forth, vibrating the round window in a complementaryrhythm.  The membranous labyrinth is caught between the two, andbounces up and down with all this sloshing.  Now let's take acloser look at the membranous labyrinth.  If we cut the cochleain cross section, it looks like this:<BR></FONT><TABLE><TR><TD WIDTH=257><P><IMG SRC="aud3.gif"></TD><TD WIDTH=257><BR><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The membranous labyrinth of the cochlea encloses the endolymph-filled <B>scala media</B>.  The two compartments of the bony labyrinth, which house the perilymph, are called the <B>scalae vestibuli</B> and <B>tympani</B>.  Within the scala media is the receptor organ, the <B>organ of Corti</B>.  It rests on part of the membranous labyrinth, the <B>basilar membrane</B>.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">A single turn of the cochlea has been outlined in blue.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">You can see the auditory nerve exiting at the base of the cochlea; it will travel through the temporal bone to the brainstem.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The auditory hair cells sit within the organ of Corti. There are <B>inner hair cells</B>, which are the auditory receptors,and <B>outer hair cells</B>, which help to &quot;tune&quot; thecochlea, as well as supporting cells.  The sensitive stereociliaof the inner hair cells are embedded in a membrane called the<B>tectorial membrane</B>.  As the basilar membrane bounces upand down, the fine stereocilia are sheared back and forth underthe tectorial membrane.  When the stereocilia are pulled in theright direction, the hair cell depolarizes.  This signal is transmittedto a nerve process lying under the organ of Corti.  This neurontransmits the signal back along the auditory nerve to the brainstem. As with almost all sensory neurons (the exception is in the retina),its cell body lies outside the CNS in a ganglion.  In this case,the ganglion is stretched out along the spiralling center axisof the cochlea, and is named the <B>spiral ganglion</B>.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">You can see most of the structures in this highermagnification of the organ of Corti; unfortunately, the innerhair cells have been artifactually pulled away from the tectorialmembrane.<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="aud4.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The basilar membrane is actually thinner and narrowerat the base of the cochlea than at the tip (apex), which seemsbackwards given that the cochlea is widest at the base.  The propertiesof the basilar membrane change as its shape changes; just as withguitar strings, thin things vibrate to high pitches, and thickthings vibrate to low pitches.  This means that the basilar membranevibrates to high frequencies at the base of the cochlea and tolow frequencies at the apex.  A hair cell at the base of the cochleawill respond best to high frequencies, since at those frequenciesthe basilar membrane underneath it will vibrate the most.  Thekey idea is that <U>although the hair cells are arranged in orderalong the basilar membrane, from high-frequency to low-frequency,it is the properties of the basilar membrane that set up thisgradient, not the properties of the hair cells</U>.  <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Our ability to discriminate two close frequenciesis actually much better than one would predict just from the mechanicsof the basilar membrane.  One theory to explain the mystery isthat the outer hair cells help to &quot;sharpen the tuning&quot;. Outer hair cells can actually move (change length) in responseto nerve stimulation.  If they could push the basilar membraneup and down, they could amplify or damp vibrations at will, makingthe inner hair cells more or less responsive.  (Just like youcan push a child higher and higher on a swing or bring her toa halt - it's all in when you push.)  An interesting philosophicalquestion here is, if the outer hair cells can move the basilarmembrane, can that in turn move the oval window?  And the stapes? And the eardrum?  Can the ear, in fact, work in reverse and becomea speaker?  You may laugh, but there has been at least one casein the history of medicine of a patient complaining of persistentwhispering in her ear.  She was dismissed as crazy, until oneobliging doctor finally put his stethoscope to her ear and listened. <U>He could hear the whispering too</U>.  You can draw your ownmoral from this story.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">However, most cases of tinnitus (a persistent ringing,whistling, or roaring in the ears) are not audible to the examiner. Little is known about the phenomenon, which is unfortunate becauseit can be very distressing to the sufferer.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>C.  Central auditory pathways:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The auditory nerve carries the signal into the brainstemand synapses in the <B>cochlear nucleus</B>.  From the cochlearnucleus, auditory information is split into at least two streams,much like the visual pathways are split into motion and form processing. Auditory nerve fibers going to the <B>ventral cochlear nucleus</B>synapse on their target cells with giant, hand-like terminals. Something about this tight connection allows the timing of thesignal to be preserved to the microsecond (action potentials areon the order of milliseconds, so it is no mean feat).  The ventralcochlear nucleus cells then project to a collection of nucleiin the medulla called the <B>superior olive</B>.  In the superiorolive, the minute differences in the timing and loudness of thesound in each ear are compared, and from this you can determinethe direction the sound came from.  The superior olive then projectsup to the <B>inferior colliculus</B> via a fiber tract calledthe <B>lateral lemniscus</B>.<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="aud5.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The second stream of information starts in the <B>dorsalcochlear nucleus</B>.  Unlike the exquisitely time-sensitive localizationpathway, this stream analyzes the quality of sound.  The dorsalcochlear nucleus, with fairly complex circuitry, picks apart thetiny frequency differences which make &quot;bet&quot; sound differentfrom &quot;bat&quot; and &quot;debt&quot;.  This pathway projectsdirectly to the inferior colliculus, also via the lateral lemniscus.<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="aud6.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Notice that both pathways are bilateral.  The consequenceof this is that lesions anywhere along the pathway usually haveno obvious effect on hearing.  Deafness is essentially only causedby damage to the middle ear, cochlea, or auditory nerve.   </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">From the inferior colliculus, both streams of informationproceed to sensory thalamus.  The auditory nucleus of thalamusis the <B>medial geniculate nucleus</B>.  The medial geniculateprojects to <B>primary auditory cortex</B>, located on the banksof the temporal lobes.  <BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="aud7.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Keep in mind, as you try to remember this pathway,that the auditory nuclei all seem to have counterparts in othersystems, making life confusing.  Fibers from the cochlear nucleiand the <U>s</U>uperior olive (not the inferior) travel up the<U>l</U>ateral lemniscus (not the medial) to the <U>i</U>nferiorcolliculus (not the superior), and then to the <U>m</U>edial geniculate(not the lateral).  Try remembering the mnemonic,</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino"> &quot;S-L-I-M&quot; .<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>D.  The vestibular system</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The purpose of the vestibular system is to keep tabson the position and motion of your head in space.  There are reallytwo components to monitoring motion, however.  You must be ableto detect rotation, such as what happens when you shake or nodyour head.  In physics, this is called <B>angular acceleration</B>. You must also be able to detect motion along a line - such aswhat happens when the elevator drops beneath you, or on a moresubtle note, what happens when your body begins to lean to oneside.  This is called <B>linear acceleration</B>.  The vestibularsystem is divided into two receptor organs to accomplish thesetasks.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>E.  The semicircular canals:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The <B>semicircular canals</B> detect angular acceleration. There are 3 canals, corresponding to the three dimensions inwhich you move, so that each canal detects motion in a singleplane.  Each canal is set up as shown below, as a continuous endolymph-filledhoop.  The actual hair cells sit in a small swelling at the basecalled the <B>ampula</B>.</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="aud8.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The hair cells are arranged as a single tuft thatprojects up into a gelatinous mass, the <B>cupula</B>.  When youturn your head in the plane of the canal, the inertia of the endolymphcauses it to slosh against the cupula, deflecting the hair cells. Now, if you were to keep turning in circles, eventually the fluidwould catch up with the canal, and there would be no more pressureon the cupula.  If you stopped spinning, the moving fluid wouldslosh up against a suddenly still cupula, and you would feel asthough you were turning in the other direction.  This is the explanationfor the phenomenon you discovered when you were 5.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Naturally, you have the same arrangement (mirrored)on both sides of the head.  Each tuft of hair cells is polarized- if you push it one way, it will be excited, but if you pushit the other way, it will be inhibited.  This means that the canalson either side of the head will generally be operating in a <B>push-pull</B>rhythm; when one is excited, the other is inhibited (see below). It is important that both sides agree as to what the head isdoing.  If there is disagreement, if both sides push at once,then you will feel debilitating vertigo and nausea.  This is thereason that infections of the endolymph or damage to the innerear can cause vertigo.  However, if one vestibular nerve is cut,the brain will gradually get used to only listening to one side- this can actually be a treatment for intractable vertigo.</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="aud9.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">A large role of the semicircular canal system isto keep your eyes still in space while your head moves aroundthem.  If you nod and shake and swivel your head, you will findthat you have no trouble staying focused on this page.  But holda piece of paper in front of you and shake it around, and youreyes will not be able to keep up with the quick movements.  Thereason is that the semicircular canals exert direct control overthe eyes, so they can directly compensate for head movements. Recall that the eye is controlled by three pairs of muscles;the medial and lateral rectus, the superior and inferior rectus,and the inferior and superior oblique.  You may also rememberthat their directions of motion seemed to be at crazy diagonals. Those same crazy diagonals are matched closely by the three planesof the semicircular canals, so that a single canal (in general)interacts with a single muscle pair.  The entire compensatoryreflex is called the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR).<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>F.  The VOR:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Although the VOR works on all three muscle pairs,the medial-lateral rectus pair, coupled to the horizontal canal,is geometrically the easiest to draw.  Here is the setup, lookingdown at a person's head:</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="aud10.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The lateral rectus muscle will pull the eye laterally,and the medial rectus will pull the eye medially, both in thehorizontal plane.  The horizontal canal detects rotation in thehorizontal plane.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">If you <U>move your head to the left, you will excitethe left horizontal canal</U>, inhibiting the right.  To keepyour eyes fixed on a stationary point, you need to fire the rightlateral rectus and the left medial rectus, to move the eyes tothe right.</FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="aud11.gif"></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The pathway is as follows:  the vestibular nerveenters the brainstem and synapses in the vestibular nucleus. Cells that received information from the left horizontal canalproject to the abducens nucleus on the right side, to stimulatethe lateral rectus.  They also project to the oculomotor nucleuson the left side, to stimulate the medial rectus.  Although notshown on the diagram, the same vestibular cells also inhibit theopposing muscles (in this case, the right medial rectus, and theleft lateral rectus).<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">What about the other side?  The right horizontalcanal is wired to the complementary set of muscles.  Since itis inhibited, it will not excite its target muscles (the rightmedial rectus and the left lateral rectus), nor will it inhibitthe muscles you want to use (the right lateral rectus and theleft medial rectus).  Got it?  OK, then draw out what would happenif you turned your head to the right.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">A great deal of the VOR axon traffic travels viaa fiber highway called the <B>MLF</B> (medial longitudinal fasciculus). The integrity of this tract is crucial for the VOR to work properly. It is occasionally damaged by medial brainstem strokes.  <BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>G.  The utricle and saccule:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The utricle and saccule detect linear acceleration. Each organ has a sheet of hair cells (the macula) whose ciliaare embedded in a gelatinous mass, just like the semicircularcanals.  Unlike the canals, however, this gel has a clump of smallcrystals embedded in it, called an otolith (yes, all along you'vehad rocks in your head).  The otoliths provide the inertia, sothat when you move to one side, the otolith-gel mass drags onthe hair cells.  Once you are moving at a constant speed, suchas in a car, the otoliths come to equilibrium and you no longerperceive the motion.<BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The hair cells in the utricle and saccule are polarized,but they are arrayed in different directions so that a singlesheet of hair cells can detect motion forward and back, side toside.  Each macula can therefore cover two dimensions of movement. The utricle lays horizontally in the ear, and can detect anymotion in the horizontal plane.  The saccule is oriented vertically,so it can detect motion in the sagittal plane (up and down, forwardand back).  <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">A major role of the saccule and utricle is to keepyou vertically oriented with respect to gravity.  If your headand body start to tilt, the vestibular nuclei will automaticallycompensate with the correct postural adjustments.  This is notjust something that happens if the floor tilts - if you watchsomeone trying to stand still, you will notice constant smallwavers and rocking back and forth. <BR><BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=#0000FF FACE="Palatino"><A HREF="http://thalamus.wustl.edu/course">RETURN TO HOME PAGE</A><BR></FONT></B></BODY></HTML>
