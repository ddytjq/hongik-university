<tt>Linger</tt> integrates the coupled, linearized, Einstein, Boltzmann, and fluid
equations governing the evolution of scalar metric perturbations and photons
(both polarizations), neutrinos (both massless and, optionally, massive),
baryons, and cold dark matter in a perturbed flat Robertson-Walker universe.
In other words, it computes the linear evolution of fluctuations generated
in the early universe through the radiation-dominated era and recombination,
down to a small redshift input by the user.  The results are useful both for
calculations of the CMB anisotropy (with <tt>deltat</tt>) and the linear power
spectrum of matter fluctuations (with <tt>grafic</tt>).  <tt>Linger</tt> provides
the link between the primeval fluctuations in the early universe and those
at late times (e.g., the present).  The <tt>linger</tt> codes are described
in a preprint by Ma and Bertschinger [<A HREF="node15.html#mab1">3</A>].
<P>
Many other groups have written codes to integrate these equations (or a subset
of them): [<A HREF="node15.html#py70">4</A>]--[<A HREF="node15.html#st94">18</A>]; see [<A HREF="node15.html#hu">19</A>] for a recent summary.
However, we believe that our treatment is the most accurate to date in its
treatment of the physics and the numerical integrations.  Our physics model
includes an accurate treatment of hydrogen recombination and the decoupling
of photons and baryons based on [<A HREF="node15.html#p68">20</A>] with the addition of helium; helium
recombination using the Saha equation (this is adequate given the high
electron densities); a full treatment of Thomson scattering including two
photon polarizations and the full angular dependences of the scattering
cross section and distribution functions (see [<A HREF="node15.html#k95">21</A>] for a complete
presentation of the theory); full computation of the gravitational sources
from all relevant particle species including all relativistic shear stresses
of photons and neutrinos; and full integration down to the final redshift
without use of any free-streaming approximation.  Our numerical methods
include a multipole expansion of the angular distribution of photons and
massless neutrinos to sufficiently high degree to accurately represent them
(up to <b>l=10000</b> for late times and high spatial wavenumbers, when computing
CMB anisotropy; up to <b>l=100</b> when computing matter transfer functions);
accurate sampling (with 128 points) of the momentum distribution of massive
neutrinos (and computation of the angular multipoles up to <b>l=50</b>); and
sufficiently fine sampling in the spatial wavenumber <b>k</b> to give accurate
matter transfer functions and CMB anisotropy without any additional smoothing.
<P>
The aim of <tt>linger</tt> is to produce results that are accurate to about 0.1%.
This accuracy is, admittedly, somewhat artificial, since nonlinear effects
or other physics that is neglected by <tt>linger</tt> may produce larger
differences.  (Research into this question is currently a focus of activity
for theoreticians investigating CMB anisotropy.)   However, I believe that
it is still worthwhile to solve the linear problem with such high precision.
Of course, all of this effort has a cost in the need for substantial computing
resources.  We discuss the requirements in section <A HREF="node4.html#lingerusage">2.1</A>.
The user who wishes to can easily change <tt>linger</tt> to be faster and
less accurate, by reducing the maximum multipole expansion orders <tt>lmax0</tt>
and <tt>lmaxnu</tt> set in fortran-77 <tt>parameter</tt> statements in the code
(though be sure to search for occurrences in several subroutines).
<P>
The primary restrictions of the current release of <tt>linger</tt> are: (1) it
assumes the unperturbed spacetime is flat, thereby excluding open or closed
models, and (2) only scalar (i.e., density) perturbations are included
(excluding vector and tensor perturbations, also known as gravitomagnetism
and gravitational radiation).  The second restriction is not a serious
limitation for computations of the matter fluctuation spectrum, although it
can lead to an underestimate of the large angular scale CMB anisotropy in
some cosmological models.  The first restriction, on the other hand, is more
serious given the interest among astronomers in testing open universe models
(despite the fact that such models lack a natural primeval fluctuation
spectrum).  However, <tt>linger</tt> does allow for a cosmological constant,
so that <IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img4.gif"> in matter may be less than unity.
<P>
<tt>Linger</tt> comes in two versions, corresponding to two different gauge
choices for coordinates in the perturbed spacetime: synchronous gauge
(<tt>linger_syn</tt>) and longitudinal or conformal Newtonian gauge
(<tt>linger_con</tt>).  The latter case is equivalent to the so-called
gauge-invariant formalism.  (For a discussion of these and other gauges,
see refs. [<A HREF="node15.html#b80">22</A>]--[<A HREF="node15.html#blh95">25</A>]).  Although physically equivalent,
the output of the two codes is different.  Roughly speaking, the synchronous
case corresponds to using Lagrangian spatial coordinates that are fixed
with respect to the cold dark matter, while the conformal Newtonian case
corresponds to using Eulerian coordinates that (at late times) are (nearly)
fixed with respect to the microwave background.  See [<A HREF="node15.html#mab1">3</A>] for the
transformation between the two sets of variables.
<P>
The two varieties of <tt>linger</tt> are useful for different types of initial
conditions.  Isentropic (often inappropriately called adiabatic) initial
conditions, the type most naturally produced by cosmic inflation, may be
evolved equally well numerically in either gauge.  Many workers prefer the
conformal Newtonian gauge because the coordinates are minimally deformed
so that gauge variables are close to the quantities measured by Newtonian
observers.  Isocurvature fluctuations, which may be produced by first-order
phase transitions in the early universe, should be evolved in synchronous
gauge because they require fine-tuning in conformal Newtonian and other
gauges [<A HREF="node15.html#b80">22</A>].
<P>
Although the data output by the two versions of <tt>linger</tt> differ because
of the gauges used, these differences do not affect their use because
physical observables are gauge-invariant.  <tt>Linger</tt> output is used in
COSMICS for two purposes: computing the CMB angular power spectrum (in
<tt>deltat</tt>) and computing and using the matter power spectrum (in <tt>
grafic</tt>).  In the former case, the angular power spectrum <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img5.gif"> is
gauge-invariant for <b>l&gt;1</b>.  The monopole (<b>l=0</b>) is unobservable, while
the dipole (<b>l=1</b>) reflects the local motion of our galaxy and is
gauge-dependent simply because the coordinates of one gauge move relative
to those of another.  In synchronous gauge there is a very large <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img6.gif">
(compared with the higher multipole moments) simply because the CMB
radiation has a large velocity (<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img7.gif"> km s<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img8.gif">) relative to the
rest frame defined by the matter --- the cold dark matter is, by definition,
at rest in synchronous coordinates.  In conformal Newtonian gauge, on
the other hand, the dipole moment is very small (comparable with the
higher multipoles) while the matter velocity is now nonzero.
<P>
The matter power spectrum used in <tt>grafic</tt> is computed from the
gauge-invariant potential <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img9.gif"> of conformal Newtonian gauge using the
Poisson equation:
<P><A NAME=poisson>&#160;</A><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img10.gif"><P>
where <b>k</b> is the spatial wavenumber and <b>a</b> is the cosmic expansion
scale factor.  (This equation assumes that space curvature is negligible;
in section <A HREF="node11.html#grafic2">4.1.2</A> below it is generalized to the case of open
models.)  On scales small compared with the Hubble distance, <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img11.gif">
equals the Newtonian gravitational potential and <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img12.gif"> is the net
matter density fluctuation; on larger scales they are the natural
generalized gauge-invariant variables defined by Bardeen [<A HREF="node15.html#b80">22</A>].
<tt>Linger_con</tt> outputs <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img13.gif">; in <tt>linger_syn</tt> we output the
synchronous gauge metric variables plus the variable giving the exact
transformation to <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img14.gif">.  So, either <tt>linger</tt> code may be used, with
no difference whatsoever for <tt>grafic</tt>, which automatically determines
the correct variables.  (The careful user should try both and compare them
as a test of speed and numerical precision.)
