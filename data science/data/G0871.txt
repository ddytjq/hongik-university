    of people in the Northern Hemisphere will have one last chance
    in this millennium to marvel at a total solar eclipse. The 50
    mile wide path of totality will extend from the western Atlantic
    ocean, through Europe and Turkey, all the way across India into
    the Indian Ocean. At the instant of totality viewers situated
    along this narrow path can glimpse some of Nature's rarest wonders

    mysterious shadow bands, and, of course, the Sun's ephemeral

    Solar eclipses happen when the new Moon passes in front of the
    Sun. They don't take place every month because of the tilt of
    the Moon's orbit. The Moon's orbit around the earth is slightly
    elliptical, as is the earth's orbit around the Sun. Therefore,
    the Moon and the Sun do not always appear to be precisely the
    same size in the sky. The Moon's diameter ranges from 29.3 to
    33.5 arcminutes while the Sun's diameter may be anywhere between
    31.5 to 32.5 arcminutes. About once a year  (on average) when
    the Moon passes directly in front of the Sun, and 
the Moon is the same size or larger than the Sun, we have a total eclipse somewhere on Earth. <BR>

    </TABLE>Total eclipses are widely regarded as one of Nature's
    greatest spectacles. The chill and sweep of the Moon's shadow,
    the sparkle of Bailey's beads, and the sight of the corona blazing
    across the darkened daytime sky are life-altering experiences
    for some observers. Many become globe-hopping &quot;eclipse addicts,&quot;
    die-hard lovers of totality who spend years and thousands of
    dollars traveling from one total eclipse to another. <BR>
<BR>
    This year's total eclipse on August 11, 1999 could be even better
    than usual, thanks to the solar maximum. Every 11 years the sun
    undergoes a period of heightened activity. There are frequent
    solar flares, lots of sunspots, and the corona expands to many
    times its average size. The August 11 solar eclipse will take
    place just 9 months before the predicted maximum in mid-2000.
    Even now the Sun is very active, raising expectations for an
    unusually beautiful eclipse.</P>

    <H2>Seeing the Sights</H2>

    <P>Most eclipse watchers consider the corona to be the most beautiful
    of all the phenomena of totality. The super-hot outer atmosphere
    of the sun glows with the intensity of the full moon when the
    sun's disk is completely occulted. Pearly white coronal streamers
    sometimes stretch several degrees across the sky during eclipses
    near a solar maximum. <BR>

    <P>Second only to the corona for dramatic impact, by some accounts,
    is the Moon's shadow. As totality approaches the shadow can be
    seen sweeping across the landscape at over 1000 miles per hour.
    According to Michael Maunder and Patrick Moore, in their book
    <U>The Sun in Eclipse</U>, &quot;It...gives the impression of
    a vast dark cloak rushing toward you and then enveloping you:
    the general effect can only be described as eerie.&quot; Sometimes,
    as the Moon's shadow approaches, &quot;shadow bands&quot; can
    be seen. These are poorly understood, wavy lines of alternating
    shadow and light somewhat like the ripples on the bottom of a
    swimming pool.</P>

    <P>The swift arrival of the Moon's shadow transforms the landscape.
    The darkness of totality resembles nighttime, and plants and
    animals react accordingly. Birds stop singing and may go to roost.
    Daytime flower blossoms begin to close as if for the night. The
    temperature drops in the coolness of the Moon's shadow. All of
    Nature seems to pause for this brief moment of daytime darkness.</P>

    <P>There is a special quality to the darkness of a total eclipse.
    The sky near the horizon still appears bright, and this distant
    scattered light produces a slight reddish glow and unusual shadow
    effects. Because the direct light of the Sun is blocked, some
    of the brighter stars and planets become visible. Because this
    year's eclipse occurs just one day before the peak of the Perseid
    meteor shower, sky watchers may also see some rare daytime meteors.</P>

    <P><IMG SRC="images/eclipse/duanesanim_2.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" 
    BORDER="2" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="190" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">The duration
    of totality varies depending on the eclipse and the viewing site.
    On August 11, 1999, the maximum duration will be 2 minutes 22
    seconds for observers in south-central Romania. One of the longest
    eclipses on record will take place in <A HREF="http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEpath/SE2009Jul22T.html">2009</A>
    when the &quot;moment&quot; of totality will endure for over
    6 minutes as seen from a spot in the Pacific Ocean. <BR>

     SIZE="-1" FACE="arial,helvetica">: Just before the Moon completely
    covers the Sun tiny specks of light called &quot;Bailey's Beads&quot;
    appear. Caused by sunlight shining through valleys on the edge
    of the Moon, these points of light are spaced irregularly around
    the disappearing edge of the Sun, forming the appearance of a
    string of beads around the dark disk of the Moon. Bailey's beads
    make their brief appearance up to 15 seconds before totality.
    When a single point of sunlight remains, a beautiful &quot;diamond
    ring&quot; effect is created against the outline of the Moon.
    This final sparkling instant signals the arrival of the moon's
    shadow. Bailey's Beads and the Diamond ring are seen again in
    reverse order at the end of totality when the Moon moves away
    from the Sun. During totality colorful prominences and the reddish
    chromosphere are also frequently visible. The animation pictured
    here is based on art by Duane Hilton.</FONT></P>

</table>Scientists have used solar eclipses as an important
    research tool for hundreds of years. Eighteenth century astronomers,
    including Edmund Halley, routinely monitored eclipses to refine
    the orbits of the Moon and Earth. In the 19th century, astrophysicists
    realized that the chromosphere, prominences, and the corona were
    important physical aspects of the sun, and they followed eclipses
    as the only way to study these intriguing phenomena. In the early
    20th century, solar eclipses provided crucial tests of Einstein's
    then-new successful theory of General Relativity. <BR>
<BR>
    Today, with space telescopes and modern coronagraphs it is sometimes
    thought that eclipses have little to offer in the way of science.
    This is not so. <BR>
<BR>
    To limit the scattering of sunlight, space-borne coronagraphs
    have had to block out the inner corona, and ground-based observations
    of the corona (excluding eclipses) cannot see the corona very
    far from the Sun. The Moon is still Nature's greatest coronagraph!
<BR>
<BR>
    Eclipses are also unbeatable ways to precisely measure the Sun's
    diameter. Members of the IOTA routinely travel to solar eclipses
    which they observe near the edge of the path of totality. By
    stretching a team of observers perpendicular to the expected
    edge of the shadow's path they are able to measure the location
    of the edge with a precision to less than 100 meters. This translates
    into a measurement of the Sun's diameter with a precision of
    only 0.004 arcseconds, or 20 miles. According to such measurements,
    the Sun may have been 0.4 arcseconds larger in 1983 than it was
    in 1979. Is the Sun oscillating? It's too soon to say. Some of
    the eclipse measurements are controversial, and more data are
    needed. IOTA members will be on hand for the August 11, 1999
    eclipse and they intend to continue their work during future
    eclipses as well. <BR>

    <A NAME="birdsandbees"></A><IMG SRC="images/eclipse/bee2.gif"
    ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="2" WIDTH="94" HEIGHT="94" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0">Some
    of the most fascinating eclipse research has nothing to do with
    astronomy. Biologists and zoologists sometimes use eclipses to
    study the circadian rhythms of living creatures. Between 1954
    and 1975, two Polish zoologists, R. Wojtusiak and Z. Majlert,
    conducted a unique set of experiments in which they observed
    the behavior of mammals, birds, and insects during seven eclipses
    with varying degrees of coverage, including totality. They discovered
    that the daily habits of mammals were little affected by the
    eclipse, but that birds and especially insects were influenced.
    Under the Moon's shadow, many species of birds manifested anxiety
    and roosting behavior, and nearly all birds stopped singing (which
    contributes to the oft-noted quietude of totality). Insects are
    affected even more. During eclipses studied by the Polish team,
    bees returned to their hives en mass, nocturnal moths appeared,
    and butterflies settled in the grass as though it were night.
    The most sensitive species, bees, have been observed to return
    to their hives during partial eclipses covering only 19% of the
    Sun! <BR>
<BR>
    Other biologists have followed the ground-breaking experiments
    of the Polish team with observations that confirm the influence
    of eclipses on the behavior of birds, insects, and even nematodes
    and plankton! More information about these studies can be found
    in J.B. Zirker's book, <U>Total Eclipses of the Sun</U>. <BR>
<BR>
    There are many other research applications of solar eclipses,
    including global gravity measurements, investigations of ionization
    and radio propagation in Earth's atmosphere and studies of asteroid
    dust and cometary debris in the innermost solar system. The full
    range of research opportunities presented by a solar eclipse
    is too broad to review here. Suffice it to say that solar eclipses
    promise great value to scientific research for many, many years
    to come.</P>

    <H2>Eclipses on other planets</H2>

    <P>If the Moon were slightly smaller than the Sun, the best eclipses
    would be annular ones with no dramatic corona or blackening of
    the daytime sky. If the Moon were slightly larger, the full glory
    of the chromosphere and prominences surrounded by the glowing
    corona would be lost. Fortunately, the Moon is &quot;just right.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
    Earth is the only planet in the solar system with spectacular
    solar eclipses. Thanks to an apparently improbable coincidence,
    the Sun and the Moon are almost exactly the same size as seen
    from Earth. The Sun is 400 times larger than the Moon, but it
    is also 400 times farther away. The table below, adapted from
    <U>The Sun in Eclipse</U> by Maunder and Moore, shows that there
    is no other planet where the angular diameter of a satellite
    is so close to that of the Sun. The most interesting case may
    be Jupiter's moon Amalthea, which subtends an angle of 7' 24&quot;
    as seen from the cloud tops of Jupiter, and where the sun is
    nearly the same size at 6' 09&quot;. Still the sizes of Amalthea
    and the Sun are quite different compared to the similarity between
    the angular sizes of the Sun and our own satellite. Another interesting
    case, noted by Maunder and Moore, is that of Mars's satellite
    Phobos, which subtends an angle up to 12.3 arcminutes as seen
    from the surface of the red planet. Phobos transits the Sun about
    1300 times in every Martian year and each time it does there
    would be a hole in the middle of the 21' Sun near &quot;totality.&quot;
    Maunder &amp; Moore argue that the novelty of such a sight would
    soon wear off for future Martian colonists because it happens
    so frequently.</P>

    <P>It has often been asked if the similarity of the Moon's and
    Sun's diameters can be simple coincidence. In the absence of
    more data about the statistical distribution of sizes of stars,
    planets, and moons in solar systems other than our own, it would
    seem that the most likely answer is &quot;yes.&quot; Nevertheless,
    it is a fortunate coincidence for the denizens of Earth. <BR>
