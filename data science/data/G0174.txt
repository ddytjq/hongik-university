<H1>DIRBE Data Products </H1>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P>The DIRBE data sets cover the whole sky and provide photometric data
in 10 bands ranging in wavelength from 1.25 to 240 microns, plus polarimetric
data at 1.25, 2.2, and 3.5 microns. The <A HREF="#pds">Project Data Sets</A>
give the sky brightness as observed, including zodiacal and Galactic components,
as well as the <A HREF="http://space.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/cobe/dirbe_press_release.html">Cosmic
Infrared Background</A> radiation which the DIRBE was designed to seek.
Some of the higher level <A HREF="#asds">Analyzed Science Data Sets</A>
include estimates of the zodiacal light intensity, or have the zodiacal
light subtracted. Individual data products are comprised of various subsets
of the sky survey observations made by the DIRBE over a 10-month period
while the COBE cryogen lasted. Most of the data products are available
on CDs, which can be ordered through the <A HREF="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/about_cruso.html">NSSDC's
Request Coordination Office</A>. <B><I>All of the data products, except
the Time-Ordered Data, are <A HREF="#ftp">ftp </A>and 
<A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dirbe/">Web</A>
accessible. </I></B></P>

<P>Detailed descriptions of the DIRBE, the data processing, and the data
products are given in an <A HREF="dirbe_exsup.html"> Explanatory Supplement</A>.
A <A HREF="http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ir/cobe/dirbe/spect.html"> Small Source
Spectral Energy Distribution Browser </A> can be used to assess the visibility
of an unresolved or small extended source in the DIRBE data and see its
spectral energy distribution. As noted in section 5.6.6 of the Explanatory
Supplement, the DIRBE Calibrated Individual Observations (or Time-ordered
Data) are required to derive definitive point source fluxes.  A

<P>The maps are distinguished by the time interval over which multiple
observations of a single celestial position are coadded. All of the sky
maps are <A HREF="skymap_info.html"> quadrilateralized spherical cube projections
in ecliptic coordinates</A> presented in FITS binary tables. Each cube
face covers 4pi/6 sr in 256 x 256 pixels of approximately equal area; the
area is equivalent to a square 0.32 deg on a side. The DIRBE beam (instantaneous
field of view) is 0.7 x 0.7 deg. </P>

<H2><A NAME="tod"></A>Time-ordered Data (TOD) </H2>

<P><I>Consider using the <A HREF="#cio">Calibrated Individual Observations</A>&nbsp;instead.</I>
The TOD product includes calibrated sky brightness values and is the most
complete public record of the DIRBE observations. It is necessary to understand
the operating modes of the instrument and to recognize various mission
events in order to select and interpret the data of interest; thorough
familiarity with information contained in the DIRBE Explanatory Supplement
is recommended. The contents and format of the TOD product are given in
an ASCII file called <A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dirbe/ancil/DIRBE_TOD_RECORD_STRUCTURE.ASC">
dirbe_tod_record_structure.asc</A>. The TOD product is not intended for
heavy use by the research community, although there may be some applications,
such as correlative studies of transient events, for which this product
is necessary. The DIRBE TOD - in 41 files each covering one week - are
available on tape from the NSSDC. For information, contact the <A HREF="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/about_cruso.html">
Request Coordination Office</A>. </P>

<H2><A NAME="cio"></A>Calibrated Individual Observations (CIO) </H2>

<P>The CIO&nbsp;files contain calibrated 1/8th second sampled sky survey
data, in pixel number order, for each day of the cryogenic mission. In
nearly all applications, the CIO&nbsp;can be thought of as a user-friendly
version of the <A HREF="#tod">TOD</A>. There are 285 CIO data files. Corresponding
to each data file is a CIO&nbsp;Pixel Index file, which is designed to
facilitate data retrieval (<I>e.g.,</I> selection of time strings). All
CIO&nbsp;files are FITS&nbsp;binary tables. The 
<A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dirbe/cio/">CIO&nbsp;files
are on line</A>. A typical
data file is about 60 MB in size. To order the CIO data on CD-Rs or tape,
contact the <A HREF="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/about_cruso.html">
Request Coordination Office</A>. </P>

<H2><A NAME="weekly_maps"></A>Weekly Sky Maps </H2>

<P>These maps provide weekly-averaged intensity values for each pixel and
photometric band, plus Stokes Q and U parameters at 1.25, 2.2, and 3.5
microns. Each map covers approximately half of the sky. As a set, the 41
Weekly Sky Maps offer an unprecedented view of the interplanetary dust
(IPD) cloud as each celestial direction was observed by DIRBE at a variety
of angles through the IPD. To order the Weekly Map data on CDs, contact
the <A HREF="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/about_cruso.html"> Request
Coordination Office</A>. The 
<A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dirbe/cold_weekly_maps/">
Weekly Sky Maps are on line</A>. </P>

<H2><A NAME="dcaf"></A>DIRBE&nbsp;Calibrated Annual File (DCAF)</H2>

<P><I>Consider using the <A HREF="#dsza">DIRBE&nbsp;Sky and Zodi Atlas</A>&nbsp;instead.</I>
The DCAF files contain the same data as the Weekly Sky Maps but are organized
differently. This product gives a pixel-by-pixel view of the intensity
variations seen as a function of time, collecting all the weekly-averaged
intensities measured at a given pixel into a single file. Those who wish
to study or model time-variable signals, such as the zodiacal light, will
find this organization convenient. There are 6 DCAF&nbsp;data files, one
for each face of the COBE&nbsp;Sky Cube, and each data file is accompanied
by a DCAF&nbsp;Pixel Index file, which is designed to facilitate data retrieval.
The files are FITS&nbsp;binary tables. A typical DCAF&nbsp;data file is
~200 MB in size. To order the DCAF data on CDs, contact the <A HREF="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/about_cruso.html">
Request Coordination Office</A>. The <A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dirbe/dcaf/">DCAF&nbsp;files
are on line</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="annual_maps"></A>Annual Average Maps </H2>

<P>These maps provide a single, mission-averaged intensity value per pixel
for each of the 10 DIRBE bands. The effect of coaddition is to improve
sensitivity to faint emission. Since these maps average over the variable
zodiacal light signal, they are useful primarily at wavelengths at which
the IPD signature is weak, especially 140 and 240 microns. The Annual Average
Maps also provide information on the depth of sky coverage over the whole
cryogenic mission. These maps (1 FITS file per wavelength band, each 10.6
MB) are <A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dirbe/aam/"> network-accessible
</A> and will later be provided on CD-ROM. </P>

<H2><A NAME="e90_maps"></A>Solar Elongation = 90 deg Sky Maps </H2>

<P>These maps provide an estimate of the infrared intensity at each pixel
and wavelength band based on an interpolation of the observations made
at various times at solar elongations close to 90 degrees. To first order,
this product depicts the sky as if it were observed through a temporally
constant IPD foreground, thus enabling straightforward modeling and subtraction
of the zodiacal light to a level adequate for many Galactic studies, the
obvious drawback being that only a small portion of the available DIRBE
data is represented. The Solar Elongation = 90 deg Sky Maps (1 FITS file
per wavelength band, each 12.9 MB), are <A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dirbe/e90/">
network-accessible</A><A HREF="#ftp"> </A> and will later be provided on
CD-ROM. </P>

<H2><A NAME="Galactic_maps"></A>Galactic Plane Maps </H2>

<P>These maps are subsets of the Solar Elongation = 90 deg Sky Maps designed
to facilitate studies of the Galaxy. The maps cover Galactic latitudes
|b| &lt; 10 deg at longitudes 30 deg &lt; l &lt; 330 deg and cover |b|
&lt; 15 deg elsewhere. The Galactic Plane Maps (all 10 DIRBE bands) are
in a single 5.9 MB FITS file. The file is <A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dirbe/gpm/">network-accessible</A>
and will later be provided on CD-ROM. </P>

<H2><A NAME="dsza"></A>DIRBE&nbsp;Sky and Zodi Atlas (DSZA)</H2>

<P>In many applications, the DSZA can be used instead of the <A HREF="#dcaf">DCAF</A>;
most of the information in the DCAF is repeated in the DSZA. However, the
DSZA also includes estimates of the zodiacal light (thermal emission and
scattered light from the interplanetary dust) intensity which can be compared
directly with, or subtracted from, the DIRBE measurements. For example,
using the DSZA, one can readily compare the apparent time variability of
the sky, as observed by the DIRBE, with that of the DIRBE interplanetary
dust model (Kelsall <I>et al.</I> 1998, ApJ, submitted), or construct sky
maps like the ZSMA maps using different data selection criteria (<I>e.g.,</I>
maps based on data obtained during different weeks in the cryogenic mission).
The DSZA is accompanied by a pixel index and organized in the same fashion
as the DCAF. Data and model intensities from all 10 full-intensity wavelength
bands appear in the DSZA. The <A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dirbe/dsza/">DSZA&nbsp;files
are on line</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="zsma"></A>Zodi-Subtracted Mission Average (ZSMA) Maps</H2>

<P>The ZL intensities recorded in the <A HREF="#dsza">DSZA</A> were subtracted
week by week and the residual intensity values were averaged to create
the ZSMA&nbsp;Maps, which give the best available picture of the Galactic
and extragalactic diffuse infrared emission on degree or coarser angular
scales. In many applications, the ZSMA Maps will supersede the <A HREF="#annual_maps">Annual
Average Sky Maps</A>. Like the Annual Average Maps, the ZSMA Maps are provided
in ten FITS binary tables, one each at 1.25, 2.2, 3.5, 4.9, 12, 25, 60,
100, 140 and 240 microns. Each row of the FITS table corresponds to a DIRBE
pixel. One zodiacal light-subtracted intensity value, representing an average
over the cryogenic mission, is given per pixel. The <A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dirbe/zsma/">ZSMA&nbsp;files
are on line</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Phot_Standards"></A>Photometric Standard Values Table </H2>

<P>This FITS binary table contains photometric data obtained on 92 standard
objects which were judged not to vary in brightness at a particular wavelength
over the course of the cold mission and were used to stabilize the DIRBE
photometric system. The <A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dirbe/psv/">Table
is on line</A>, as is an <A HREF="http://nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov/anon_dir/cobe/asds/dirbe/doc/des_v2_1_asds.ps">
explanatory document</A> (an excerpt from the <A HREF="dirbe_exsup.html">
DIRBE Explanatory Supplement</A>). </P>

<H2><A NAME="ssod"></A>Solar System Objects Data</H2>

<P>The Solar System Object Dataset provides flux densities and other data
pertaining to individual passages of solar system objects through the DIRBE
field of view during the period of cryogenic operation, from 11 December
1989 to 21 September 1990. The data are given in FITS tables, one for each
of the following objects: Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Ceres, Pallas,
and Vesta. The <A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dirbe/solar_system_objects/">Solar
System Object data are on line</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="fsm"></A>Faint Source Model</H2>

<P>The Faint Source Model gives the predicted contribution to the diffuse
sky brightness at 1.25, 2.2, 3.5, 4.9, 12 and 25 microns due to (faint)
stars and other discrete Galactic sources. It was used in the search for
the cosmic infrared background to subtract an important component of the
observed near-infrared sky brightness. The model is described by Arendt
<I>et al.</I> (1998, ApJ, submitted) and in Appendix F of the <A HREF="dirbe_exsup.html">DIRBE&nbsp;Explanatory
Supplement</A>. The <A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dirbe/fsm/">Faint
Source Model files are on line</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="beam_maps"></A>Beam Profile Maps </H2>

<P>The DIRBE beam profiles are provided in a set of 16 FITS (image) files,
one file for each of the 10 full intensity bands, plus `B' and `C' polarization
channels for the three short-wavelength bands. As explained in the DIRBE
Explanatory Supplement, the beam profile in bands 1 - 4 changed slightly
with time during the mission; the FITS files for these bands each contain
three beam maps corresponding to three time intervals. The 
<A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dirbe/beam_profiles/">Beam
Profile Maps are on line</A> and will later be provided on CD-ROM. </P>

<P>Beam offsets and solid angles are given in Table 4.2-1 of the <A HREF="dirbe_exsup.html">DIRBE&nbsp;Explanatory
Supplement</A>, and also, for convenience, in <A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dirbe/ancil/DIRBE_BEAM_CHARACTERISTICS_P3B.ASC">an
ASCII table</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="spectral_response"></A>System Spectral Response Functions
</H2>

<P>Normalized system (filter + detector) response functions for each of
the 10 DIRBE bands are given in <A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dirbe/ancil/DIRBE_SYSTEM_SPECTRAL_RESPONSE_TABLE.ASC">
an ASCII table</A>. The table also appears in Appendix A of the DIRBE Explanatory
Supplement. </P>

<H2><A NAME="color_correction"></A>Color Correction Tables </H2>

<P>Following the IRAS convention, DIRBE flux densities are derived assuming
a nu*I(nu) = constant source spectrum. Color corrections must be applied
to the quoted flux densities to derive true flux densities when the spectrum
differs in shape from that assumed. The set of Color Correction Tables
given in Appendix B of the DIRBE Explanatory Supplement take into account
the system spectral response and pertain to a variety of source spectra
(power laws and modified Planck functions). The same data are provided
in <A HREF="ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/cobe/dirbe/ancil/DIRBE_COLOR_CORRECTION_TABLES.ASC">
an ASCII table. </A></P>
