Following the Helium Burning Main Sequence in massive stars, a series of 
<a href="./Nukes.html#adv_nukes">nuclear burning stages</a> transforms the 
star into an onion-like shell structure, until Silicon and Sulfur 
burning create a core of iron (and other iron-peak elements.  During this 
phase the star will criss-cross the upper regions of the H-R diagram from 
Red Supergiant to Blue Supergiant and back as different core and shell 
burning stages ignite.  Each successive nuclear burning stage releases
less energy than the previous stage, so the lifetime in each stage becomes 
progressively shorter.  For a 20 M<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif">
</sub> star:
<ul>
<li> Main sequence lifetime ~ 10 million years
<li> Helium burning (3-<img src="./images/doodads/alpha.gif">) ~ 1 million 
	years
<li> Carbon burning ~ 300 years
<li> Oxygen burning ~ 2/3 year
<li> Silicon burning ~ 2 days
</ul>

Because iron is the most tightly bound nucleus (the "break-even point" between 
fusion and fission) the star is no longer able to produce energy in the core 
via further nuclear burning stages.  Nuclear reactions <i> will continue</i>, 
however, because of the extremely high temperatures in the massive star's core.
These further reactions have a devastating effect on the star, because they 
take energy out of the core.  At such high temperatures and densities the 
gamma-ray photons present in the core have sufficient energy to destroy the 
heavy nuclei produced in the many stages of nuclear reactions, <i>e.g.</i>:
<ul><h3>
<li><sub><img src="./images/doodads/gamma.gif"></sub> + <sup>56</sup>Fe 
<sub><img src="./images/doodads/to.gif"></sub> 13<sup>4</sup>He + 4n 
</h3>
</ul>
This process, called <i>photodisintegration</i> undoes the work of a stellar 
lifetime in the core and removes the thermal 
energy necessary to provide pressure support.  The result is a 
catastrophic collapse of the core, which cannot be halted until the core has
shrunk to a size of about 10km and a density of the order of 200 million 
tons/cm<sup>3</sup>.  Under such extreme conditions electron degeneracy cannot
support the stellar core, and the free electrons are forced together with 
protons to form neutrons:
<ul><h3>
<li> p<sup>+</sup> +  e<sup>-</sup> 
<sub><img src="./images/doodads/to.gif"></sub> 
n + <sub><img src="./images/doodads/nue.gif"></sub></h3>
</ul>
The neutrinos, which escape directly from the core result in further energy 
loss and even faster collapse. The core collapses so rapidly that it 
effectively collapses out from under the stellar envelope.  When the core has 
collapsed down to a size of about 10 km, <i>neutron degeneracy</i> sets in
cusing the core to stiffen and the infalling material from the envelope
to rebound in a shockwave outward from the core.  This shockwave drives the 
remaining material from the envelope outward, compressing it and heating it 
as it moves through.

The net result is the formation of a <i>neutron star</i> in the stellar core
and the total disruption of the remainder of the star with the liberation of
about 10<sup>53</sup>ergs of energy in neutrinos and 10<sup>51</sup>ergs
of kinetic and luminous energy.  (The luminous energy release is about the 
amount of energy that the sun will release in its 10 billion year lifetime).
<p>
Here is a NASA
<a href="http://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html">supernova animation</a>
of a supernova explosion and formation of a pulsar.  The final death of a 
massive star is a <i>Type II</i> supernova.  As described 
<a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/supernovae.html">
here</a> there are two types of supernovae.  A white dwarf star in a binary 
star system may accrete material from its companion star.  If the white dwarf
exceeds the 1.44M<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif"></sub> limit
for support by electron degeneracy, it will collapse and produce a Type Ia
supernova.  Type I and II supernovae can be distinguished by their 
<a href="http://www.chapman.edu/oca/benet/intro_sn.htm">light curves</a>
and spectral emission lines.  Here is some more 
<a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/supernovae.html">
supernova</a> background and further

here</a>.

<p>
A supernova explosion may for a short period of time shine as brightly as 
the hundreds of billions of stars in its galaxy.  Here's an example - a time
series of photos of
<a href="http://astrosurf.org/jupiter/prosperi/sn/sn.htm">SN 1998S in the 
galaxy NGC 3877</a> taken in March--June 1998.

<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap951027.html">SN 1987A</a></center>
</font>
<p>

In February 1997 a supernova appeared near the Tarantula nebula in our 
satellite galaxy the 
<a href="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/xtra/ngc/lmc.html">Large 
Magellanic Cloud</a>, about 169,000 light years away.  
As the first supernova discovered in 1987, it was called
<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/guidry/violence/sn87a.html">SN1987A</a>
following astronomical convention.  SN1987A was the first "nearby" supernova
of the modern era and the closest supernova since Kepler's supernova in 1604.
Among the unique observations from SN1987A:
<ul>
<li>For the first time astronomers have observations of the star that exploded,
the <i>supernova precursor</i>, known as
<a href="http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~imamura/122/lecture-9/sk.html">Sk -69 202</a>
from a catalog of stars in the LMC by N. Sanduleak.  Sk -69 202, shown in the 
photograph above was a B3I sopergiant with an atmospheric temperature,
T = 16,000K, a luminosity of about 
100,000L<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif"></sub>, and an estimated 
mass of about 20M<sub><img src="./images/doodads/odot_sm.gif"></sub>.  An
unexpected aspect of this is that Sk -69 202 was a blue supergiant (note 
temperature and spectral type) rather than a red supergiant.
<p>
<li>At neutrino detectors in Japan (Kamiokande) and the US (IMB) neutrinos were
detected from the collapse of the stellar core of Sk -69 202.  Only about 20 
neutrinos were detected of nearly 10<sup>59</sup> neutrinos emitted as the 
core collapsed.  But, allowing for the weakness of neutrino interactions, this 
was just about the right number, strongly confirming our picture of supernova
explosions and the formation of neutron stars.<p>
<li>Gamma-ray observations have directly observed the nuclei produced in the
supernova explosion whose radioactive decay powers the expanding supernova 
shell. <i>e.g.</i>:
<ul> 
<li> <sup>56</sup>Ni <sub><img src="./images/doodads/to.gif"></sub> 
<sup>56</sup>Co + 
e<sup>+</sup> + <sub><img src="./images/doodads/nue.gif"></sub> + 
<sub><img src="./images/doodads/gamma.gif"></sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (6 days)
<li> <sup>56</sup>Co <sub><img src="./images/doodads/to.gif"></sub> 
<sup>56</sup>Fe + 
e<sup>+</sup> + <sub><img src="./images/doodads/nue.gif"></sub> + 
<sub><img src="./images/doodads/gamma.gif"></sub>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (79 days)
</ul><p>
<li>Continuing observations have provided a wealth of information about the 
supernova shockwave as it moves outward into the circumstellar medium, as 
described in this 
<a href="http://www.sciam.com/exhibit/021698shockwave/index.html">Scientific 
American</a> article.
</ul>

<p>
A supernova occurs about once per century in the Milky Way galaxy; most are
obscured from our view by gas &amp; dust, but there have been four well 
documented historical supernovae:

<u>Pulsars</u></a></font>
<p><p>
According to theory, the core of the star that remains after a supernova 
explosion is a tiny (R ~ 10km) remnant of extremely high density neutrons, 
supported by neutron degeneracy -- a neutron star. The existence of Neutron 
Stars was predicted by Baade &amp; Zwicky (1934) and Oppenheimer (1939).
But how to detect such a small remnant?
<p>

As with many things in astronomy, the discovery came in unexpected fashion
with the discovery of
<a href="http://astrosun.tn.cornell.edu/courses/astro201/pulsar.htm">
Pulsars</a>.  In 1967, Cambridge graduate student Jocelyn Bell (now Burnell)
and her advisor, Anthony Hewish, were using a special radio telescope to look
for radio scintillation, fluctuations in the signals from distant radio 
sources producted by turbulence in the interplanetary and interstellar plasma
similar to the twinkling of stars caused by atmospheric seeing.  On November 
28, Bell discovered a source with an exceptionally regular pattern of radio 
flashes.  These radio flashes occurred every 1 1/3 seconds like clockwork.
Puzzled by what sort of object could produce such a regular pattern, the 
source was initially dubbed "LGM" - standing for little green men, because 
the only source that they could imagine that could be so regular was some 
sort of extraterrestrial technical civilization.  After a few weeks, however,
three more rapidly pulsating sources were detected, all with different periods.
They were dubbed "pulsars."
<p>
<center><img src="./images/pulses.gif"><br>
Radio pulses from a Pulsar</center>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Original chart record of 
<a href="http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~pulsar/Education/Tutorial/tut/node3.html">
Cambridge Pulsar 1919+21</a>, the first pulsar.</ul>
<p>

What were the pulsars?  From the short pulse duration and the rapid pulse rate,
astronomers concluded that the pulsars must be exceedingly small objects.  The
radio pulses must come either from radial pulsations of a star, or from a 
rotation of a beam of light, like a lighthouse beam.  Normal stars or even 
white dwarfs are too big to pulsate that fast, and rotation rates of several 
times per second would cause even the most compact stars to fly apart.
<p>

The answer to the nature of the pulsars came with the discovery of a 
<a href="http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/users/padi/Pulse/crab.html">pulsar 
in the direction of the Crab nebula </a>, with a pulse rate of 30 times per 
second -- then the most rapid pulsar known.  Continued observation of the 
Crab Pulsar showed that it was slowing down -- its period was increasing by
38 nanoseconds per day.  This first confirmed that the pulses are produced 
by rotation; a pulsating object pulses only at its natural frequency.  More 
importantly, it simultaneously solved two mysteries: the nature of pulsars and 
why the Crab Nebula continues to shine so brightly 1000 years after the 
supernova explosion.
<p><center>
<img src="./images/crab_psr.gif">
<font size=+2 color="burgundy">
The Pulsar in the Crab Nebula</font></center>
<p>
Spinning objects have rotational energy of motion (<i>kinetic energy</i>)just 
as moving objects have translational energy of motion.  A simple calculation 
showed that a rapidly spinning neutron star slowing down by 38 nanoseconds per 
day releases almost exactly the energy which is being radiated by the Crab 
Nebula, just the p[lace where Baade &amp; Zwicky would predict that a neutron 
star might have been formed.  Although the details of how the pulsar's 
rotational energy is transformed into the luminous energy of the nebula, this 
agreement was too good to be coincidence --- astronomers were certain that
the elusive neutron stars had been discovered!  Anthony Hewish later shared 
in the Nobel Prize for the discovery of <i>pulsars</i>.
<p>
Two conservation laws in physics suggest that it is likely that neutron stars 
should rotate very rapidly and should have strong magnetic fields:
<ul>
<li><u>Conservation of <i>Angular Momentum</i></u> - as a spinning object 
decreases its size, conservation of angular momentum dictates that its rate 
of spinning must increase.  This is the physics that causes a spinning ice 
skater to "spin-up" as he or she pulls arms and legs inward.  A star like 
the sun, rotating once per month would rotate about 1000 times per second 
when contracted down to 10 km in size.
<p><center>
<img src="./images/physics/ang_mom.gif"><br>
Conservation of Angular Momentum</center><p>

<li><u>Conservation of <i>Magnetic Flux</i></u> - lines of magnetic force will 
be carried along with the collapse of the plasma core of the star.  As the 
core collapses the magnetic field lines are pulled more closely together, 
intensifying the magnetic field to valuess of the order of 10<sup>12</sup> 
gauss.</ul><p>

The detailed mechanisms by which pulsars produce their emission from radio 
waves through x-rays (up even to gamma rays in some cases) is complex and 
not fully understood, but the basic idea --- that pulsars produce a 
<i>Lighthouse Effect</i> due to an intense magnetic field whose axis is
misaligned with its rotational axis --- is generally accepted. (Remember that 
the earth's magnetic "North Pole" is not at the true nort pole, but in 
northern Canada.)  One popular view is that the rapid rotation and intense 
magnetic field of the neutron star generate strong electric fields, which 
accelerate charged particles (principally electrons because they are less 
massive) near the magnetic poles where the magnetic field is most intense.  
The charged particles, accelerated along the curved magnetic field lines
produce a type of light called <i>curvature radiation</i>.  (Say in unison:
<i>"Whenever charged particles are accelerated electromagnetic radiation
(light) is produced."</i>)<p>

Whatever the detailed mechanism, radiation near the neutron star poles
produces strong, narrow beams of light which sweep around the sky like a
tilted lighthouse, as shown below.  If the earth lies in the path of the
beam we see a pulsar.  (This idea has the added attraction that it explains
why we don't see pulsars in all supernova remnants.)<p>
<center><img src="./images/pulsar.gif"></center>
<p>
Energy is transported from the spinning neutron star into the nebula by the 
magnetic field.
HST has provided dramatic evidence of the interaction of the Crab Pulsar and
the supernova remnant.  This

through the nebula, also shown in this
<a href="./images/anim/crab.mpg">MPEG movie</a>.

Here is an excellent and detailed

Neutron Stars</a> by Cole Miller at Chicago.

Listen to the sounds of pulsars from the

<p>
Pulsars are frequently in the news because of their extreme nature and the 
wide variety of physical processes that may be studied in them.  Here's a 
selection of recent news articles:

pulsar</a> which are inferred to have exceptionally high magnetic fields, 
as high  as 10<sup>15</sup> gauss (1000 times the magnetic field of a typical 
pulsar).  The discoverers have dubbed these pulsars <i>magnetars</i>.  Here
is a <a href="http://solomon.as.utexas.edu/~duncan/magnetar.html">detailed 
account</a> by one of the discoverers.  (The existence of such high
magnetic fields and of magnetars remains controversial).
