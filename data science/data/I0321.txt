    <td><font SIZE="2">This Thursday, 17th September, the Football Supporters Association will
    be demanding answers and justice for the thousands of ordinary fans who lost World Cup
    tickets through non-supply by the Great Portland Entertainment ticket agency, now in
    liquidation.<p>Between the World Cup draw in December 1997 and late May 1998, G.P.E.
    advertised and sold thousands of tickets at inflated prices, even though they had no
    authorisation to deal in World Cup tickets. Many ordinary fans, denied tickets by a ticket
    system biased against the ordinary fan, were willing to take the risk and pay G.P.E.'s
    prices. Suspicions that G.P.E. could not deliver the tickets they'd sold were fuelled by
    the Channel 4 programme 'Dispatches', and the Department of Trade and Industry put the
    company into liquidation.The result was that thousands of fans who had saved for a trip of
    a lifetime found just days before the tournament that they had no tickets and no immediate
    prospect of getting any money back.</p>
    <p>This Thursday's Creditors' meeting, to be held at 21 BLOOMSBURY STREET, LONDON WC1B 3SS
    at 11a.m. will give those fans the first chance to find out what G.P.E. boss David Spanton
    did with their money.</p>
    <p>The F.S.A. will be there officially representing hundreds of the fans. As part of our
    'Fans Embassy ' initiative during the World Cup, the F.S.A. set up a hotline for those
    fans who had lost tickets to contact us. Sports litigation specialists, McCormicks of
    Leeds have been engaged to help identify avenues for winning compensation for fans.
    Richard Cramer of McCormicks, who will be at the meeting, said 'It was scandalous that
    Great Portland sold so many tickets without having ensured that it had those tickets in
    its possession in order to fulfil its obligations. Our aim is to ensure that the ordinary
    individual football fans, who are the greatest losers in this scandal, get the maximum
    recompense to which they are entitled.'</p>
    <p>The F.S.A.'s representatives at the creditors' meeting will have a number of searching
    questions to ask of G.P.E., questions that ask fundamental issues about the ticket system
    that F.I.F.A operated for France 98. They include:<ul>
      <li>How many tickets did G.P.E. ACTUALLY have in its possession?</li>
      <li>Where were such a large number of tickets to come from-who were Spanton's suppliers? If
        this question cannot be answered fully and honestly, then the conclusion has to be drawn
        that the whole G.P.E. operation was a fraudulent scam.</li>
      <li>If G.P.E. were NOT an official source of France 98 tickets, how did they manage to
        advertise internationally through bona-fide travel agents and reputable newspapers without
        facing any legal sanction?</li>
      <li>Where has the G.P.E. money gone? If Spanton did pay ticket suppliers, who could possibly
        have supplied him with such large blocks of tickets?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These questions are even more pressing, due to the scandalous fact that David Spanton
    has already set himself LEGALLY back up in the ticket agency business - while thousands of
    fans try to get their money, Spanton rakes it in.</p>
    <p>F.S.A. reps. Paul Thomas and Kevin Miles will be outside the meeting venue at 10.30am
    to discuss these questions with creditors and media representatives. Paul Thomas said, 'a
    World Cup ticket system biased against the ordinary fan made this scandal possible. As
    well as fighting for justice for the fans let down by G.P.E., we want to expose the causes
    of this scandal, so that F.I.F.A never allow a World Cup to be marred like this again.'</font></td>
