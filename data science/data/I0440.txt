<h5><!--mstheme--><font color="#330099"><font color="#FF0000">23rd December 1999</font><!--mstheme--></font></h5>
<p>A long awaited report on the future of the game in this country was released
yesterday (22/12/99) by the Football Task Force.</p>
<p>The report itself revealed worrying, if not predictable, splits between the
views of fans and those of clubs and administrators. The differences were so
great that each side produced separate versions of the report on several of the
most important, not to mention contentious, issues in football today, including
ticket prices, merchandising and the commercialisation of the game.</p>
<p>The crucial difference concerned the regulation of the sport in this country.
The CoFS backed report called for a permanent football regulator to be
established, along the lines of those which exist to protect consumers rights in
the privatised utilities, although it is thought that &quot;Offoot&quot; might
cause offence if said too quickly. To read more about the rôle of a regulator
within football read the CoFS <a href="charter.htm">charter</a>. There was also
a call for a &quot;ombudsfan&quot; to deal with individual complaints from
supporters.</p>
<p><u><font size="3" color="#0000FF">The Proposals of the CoFS backed report
were:</font></u></p>
<p>1. The establishment of a Football Audit Commission (FAC) to oversee a
detailed Code of Practice setting minimum standards to be met by clubs in their
treatment of fans.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
2. Lower low prices and higher high prices so those who can afford it subsidise
those who cannot.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
3. The lowest prices to be increased annually by no more than the Retail Price
Index.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
4. Half-price tickets for under-16s and students in at least 10pc of
seats.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
5. The number of season tickets would be limited to encourage support from those
who cannot afford to buy a season ticket.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
6. Home and away fans charged the same prices.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
7. Club shirts and England strips to have a minimum life span of two full
seasons.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
8. Every replica shirt to carry a &quot;sell-by&quot; date on the collar, to
warn customers when it will be replaced.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
9. Clubs to consult supporters on major decisions such as ground relocation,
Stock Market flotation, and major share sales.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p>The football clubs themselves, however, argued for the establishment of an
&quot;independent scrutiny panel&quot; which would produce an annual report on
the workings of the game, after working for a maximum of four weeks a year, a
body which, clearly, would have less power to protect the rights of fans.</p>
<p>New Sports Minister, Kate Hoey, will now consider both reports and there
possible implications. She said, &quot;One of the tasks of the government is to
... strike a balance between the necessary business interests of clubs and those
of supporters without whom clubs would not exist.&quot;</p>
<p>It is likely that the clubs-backed &quot;independent scrutiny panel&quot;
will be introduced next year whatever the final decision on the long-term future
of regulation within the sport.</p>
