<p>It is characteristic of enteric viruses that they are relatively resistant to heat and to many disinfectants,  are 

excreted in large quantities in stool, and the course of the infection is largely subclinical. A broad spectrum 

of different viruses can cause enteric infections. Rotaviruses, in particular, are important etiological agents 

in infantile diarrhea. Some of the other viruses responsible for gastroenteritis are:  

<ul>

<li>Norwalk virus, belonging to the family Reovirus 

<li>Calicivirus, belonging to the family Picornavirus-like 

<li>Astrovirus, belonging to the family Parvovirus-like 

<li>Hawaii virus, belonging to the family Picornavirus-like 

<li>Adenovirus, belonging to the family Adenovirus 

</ul>



<h3>ROTAVIRUS </h3>

 

<h4>Introduction </h4>

<p>Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe and fatal diarrhea in children and causes one million deaths annually worldwide. Rotavirus outbreaks are seasonal usually occurring from November through April. U.S. statistics show that each year during rotavirus season, there are approximately 3.1 million cases of infection that account for 433,000 visits to the doctor, 58,000 hospitalizations and 20-24 deaths. The estimated health care costs associated with rotavirus infection are over $1 billion dollars. 

<p>Rotaviruses are segmented, double-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the Reoviridae family. They are icosahedral, nonenveloped, possess a characteristic double-layered capsid with cubical symmetry and are 

55-75 nm in diameter. In electron micrographs rotavirus particles resemble wheels (hence the name) with a wide hub, short spokes, and a narrow rim. There are six distinct human rotavirus serotypes, four of which are endemic in North America. Some animal rotaviruses have antigenic and biological properties in common with the three human serotypes. 

 

<H4>Clinical Features </H4>

<p>These viruses are the principal cause of severe diarrheal illness in infants and young children, and are responsible for one-third of all hospitalizations for diarrhea in children under 5 years of age. Rotavirus diarrhea occurs in all age groups with peak occurrences in children 6-24 months of age. Infection is usually signalled by watery diarrhea lasting for 5-8 days, and may be preceded by vomiting for 1-3 days. Other features may include isotonic dehydration, compensated metabolic acidosis, and low grade fever. In the absence of resources for rehydration and restoration of electrolyte balance, the diarrhea can be life-threatening. Infected newborn infants are often asymptomatic, and the diarrhea, if present, is often mild. 

<p>Severe illnesses are often seen in premature infants. In adults, rotavirus infections tend to be mild or 

asymptomatic.   

 

<H4>Diagnosis </H4>

<p>A common feature of infections due to all of the above mentioned viruses is that cell culture isolations are not clinically efficacious. The claim by some researchers that only enterocytes are permissive of infections with gastroenteritis viruses may be valid. These viruses are routinely diagnosed by electron microscopy, demonstration of viral antigens by staining, enzyme immunoassay, serology, or PCR. 

<p>Stool collected during the first 3-5 days of illness, is the specimen of choice. Specimens collected 8 days after the onset of symptoms rarely contain viruses. 

 

<H4>Transmission </H4>

<p>Rotavirus is highly contagious and is transmitted predominantly  by the fecal-oral route, most commonly from person to person and by contaminated fomites. Waterborne outbreaks are rare. Nosocomial infections in pediatric wards are commonplace. The virus replicates in the lumen of the small intestine causing fusion of the villi and thickening of the mucus layer. Although rotaviruses are detected in respiratory tract secretions, respiratory transmission has not been proven. 

<p>The mean incubation period is 2 days with a range of 1-3 days. Following infection, patients are infectious from 1 day before the onset of symptoms, to 8-10  days afterwards. Immunocompromised patients may 

shed the virus for 2-3 weeks. 

 

<H4>Immunity and Vaccination </H4>

<p>First infection in humans may occur as early as the neonatal period. Presence of IgA and IgG antibodies in the intestines and the transfer of secretory IgA with the milk from the mother to child are considered 

essential for recovery and immunity against the rotavirus infections.  

The most promising vaccine that is near approval contains rotavirus that causes disease in rhesus monkeys (rhesus rotavirus tetravalent vaccine-RRV-TV) into which has been inserted genes which cause disease in 

humans. When this genetically altered virus is given to a child, it infects the intestine without causing diarrhea, and generates an immune response to four of the most common human rotavirus strains. In recent 

clinical trials in the United States RRV-TV vaccines were able to prevent reinfection in 57% of the patients and protect against severe rotavirus-induced diarrhea in 92%. 

<p>Routine use of this vaccine would not only save lives and prevent illnesses, but it could also save approximately $80 million in direct costs in the U.S. When indirect costs such as time lost from work are 

considered, the estimated savings are approximately $466 million.  

 

<H4>Disinfection and Inactivation </H4>

<p>Rotaviruses are resistant to many disinfectants including chlorheximidine gluconate and povidone iodine solutions. The presence of fecal material increases their stability in the environment, and their resistance to disinfectants. Phenols, formalin, iodophor compounds, and 10% household bleach are effective disinfectants.
