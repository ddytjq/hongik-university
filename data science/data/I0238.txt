What's happening with the injury at the moment?<br>
"Well I've had it since the start of pre-season and I've played on it and it's just been hanging about. I've had good games, and when it's been hurting I've had bad games, but you've just got to get it right because it's no good having me played at 80 per cent. As a midfielder, all my play is just off the cuff. It'd be alright if I was a centre-half because you can just strap yourself up and go out and head the ball and do things like that, but with me if there's anything wrong at all it's hard for me to play my natural game. But I just need to get it right and get the season going."<p>

Has it been frustrating for you having to sit out games on the sidelines?<br>
"Yeah, massively, but it's more frustrating playing through it and not being able to do what you want to do. I can imagine what it feels like when you get to 35 and your legs start to go. That must be a horrible feeling and that's what it feels like when you're carrying on an injury. Sometimes I don't think the fans know that - through no fault of their own - but they don't realise that often when a player's having a little bad spell it's maybe because he's carrying an injury and he's trying to play through it because the team needs him. I think people should be more aware of that these days because it's harder to play when you've got a knock."<p>

Is it even worse considering West Ham have had an up and down start to the season?<br>
"Yeah, it's been a strange old start to the season. We've put in some good performances and then we've been hammered like we did against Everton and Blackburn. But it is frustrating watching the boys, especially when they lose. It's alright when you're winning because you've won and you're safe and you've got the points in the bag, byut when you lose it just puts you on a real downer. I can't wait to get back into the swing of things."<p>

When things settle down what do you think West Ham can do?<br>
"We've got to settle down and get our season up and running first and foremost, but really we've got to be looking to get into Europe. You've got to be realistic - we're not going to win the league or anything like that, but there's still a lot of European places up for grabs this year. Even if you finish fourth in the premiership it can get you into the Champions League, so there'll be a lot of UEFA Cup places up for grabs this season. We've just got to get the points in the bag and then try and get into the UEFA Cup."<p>

How are things with Glenn Roeder in charge at West Ham now? Is it a lot different to how they were under Harry Redknapp?<br>
"Yeah, it's a lot different to Harry. Glenn's come in with his own ideas and he's doing his own thing, and people ought to give him time. We ought to let him get all his players fit and the team he wants to put out, because the team he's had to play recentely isn't the team he'd like to play if everyone was fit and available. As soon as he has a bit of time and starts to get his ideas across I know he's going to be a great manager for West Ham."<p>

Was it pleasing you kept hold of most of the squad in the summer?<br>
"Yeah, when Frank Lampard left that was a blow to us but then we replaced him with Don Hutchinson, who's a Scottish international, experienced and he's doing a really good job.We've kept everyone else and we've brought in Thomas Repka, who's played in Serie A for five years and he's only 26and coming into his peak, so that's another good signing. David James is an England international too, so Glenn's bought well and he's looking to add to the squad. I don't see it as though we've just held on to players, I think we've gone out and bought players. Even though they may not have been as high profile as some other signings in the league, I think they've been good signings."<p>

It's your fourth season in the premiership but you've only just turned 20. Do people sometimes expect too much of you?<br>
"It's always been there, but to be honest with you it doesn't really bother me. Maybe when I was 17 it might have bothered me, I might have read what people said in the paper but now I don't care. I don't mean that arrogantly, but my biggest critic is myself. Like you said, this is my fourth season but I haven't played a full season and I haven't played more than 30 games in any one season. Last year I played about 25 games and the season before about 20, so I've actually playedabout 60 games."<p>

Why;s that then?<br>
"I've had bad luck with injuries and I've never had a full pre-season's training, which is important. They're not injuries like a problem with your hamstring oir a problem with your knee, it's just when I've been getting clobbered. If you're going to hold on to the ball and have a wriggle people are going to kick you. I've had a few injuries where I've had lumps kicked out of me but that's football. It's hard when you get kicked by big, hard 15 stone centre halves every week but you get used to itand no one's seen what I can do properly yet. For a 20-year old I've achieved a lot but for myself I don't think I've done enough, but what can you do when you get injuries like that?"<p>

So when you hit your peak people should really watch out.<br>
"You don't know when you're going to hit your peak. I might have hit my peak already. I've just got to keep trying  to improve my game because I'm far from the finished article. You look at David Beckham and he's probably the finished article and I'm a million miles away from being there. He's up there and that's what you've got to aim for - to try to be as good as him one day."<p>

So what do you think you've got to improve about your game?<br>
"Just everything  really. Just trying to get fit is one thing, as I've still not got man's strength. You know, Glenn said to me, 'Whatever you do in your career before 25 you'll do better afterwards' because looking at all players. After 25 you're a man then properly, aren't you, you're coming into your peak? So you've got to go out  and try to enjoy your football, because you haven't got any other worries in your life, have you?"<!-- text below generated by server.
