          3rd January 2002</b><br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Football fans want their clubs to clean up their act both on and off the pitch. According to a new study on football ethics, supporters take a dim view of bad sportsmanship and believe club management put money before the game. <br>  <br> The study found a staggering 80 per cent of people in the UK who believe that it is more important for a football team to play fairly than to win. Even among fans - who may have a greater desire to win - two-thirds still agree that playing fairly is more important than winning. <br>  <br> The findings are part of a study of sportsmanship in football commissioned by leading financial services provider and football sponsor Co-operative Insurance Society (CIS). It found fans want their clubs to be friendly and fair but believe big business has taken the fun out of football with players more interested in the money than the game itself.  <br>  <br> Almost nine out of ten people (89 per cent) describe their ideal club as ambitious, friendly (88 per cent) and fair, (87 per cent). However, the perception of how clubs are in reality is very different. While 92 per cent agree clubs are ambitious, 75 per cent also describe them as greedy and 71 per cent aggressive.  <br>  <br> The findings mirror those for companies in wider society that are regarded as 'bad citizens' suggesting that football clubs are seen in the same light as the worst examples of corporate practice. <br>  <br> Only one in four people believe that players are more motivated by their love of the game than by the money they earn while seven out of ten people blame the commercialisation of football for a decline in the fun fans derive from the game.  <br>  <br> The research shows the public do not appreciate teams or players who might foul, dive, or otherwise transcend the rules of the game, to gain competitive advantage. It could be a warning for clubs like Arsenal, Chelsea, Leicester, Bolton and Leeds who have had the most red and yellow cards awarded in the Premiership so far this season.  <br>  <br> The news follows the decision of football's world governing body, FIFA, to award West Ham's Paolo di Canio the Fair Play Award for deliberately forgoing a goal-scoring opportunity in order to allow an injured opponent to be treated. <br>  <br>  <br> But both the public and football fans believe the Di Canio incident was the exception rather than the rule. While commercialisation of the game is deemed to have lowered standards of sportsmanship on the pitch, the knock-on effect has seen a decline in the standard of role models the game has to offer. <br>  <br> Even the efforts of David Beckham and Michael Owen to improve the image of players have done little to shift the belief that they are poor role models for the young. The research found players trail behind teachers, the police, professional athletes, business leaders, the Clergy and professional cricketers. However, players came out as better role models for young people than their bosses, the football managers; the Royal Family and pop stars. Politicians are seen as the worst role models of all for young people.  <br>  <br> Interestingly, the young have a more positive view of players as role models than older people. Among 16-24 year olds 44 per cent agree that football players are good role models while at the other end of the age range just 18 per cent of those aged 65 plus, agree.  <br>  <br> CIS General Manager (Marketing) Martin Clarke, who commissioned the research, said: "Clearly the public do not condone bad behaviour. They expect the highest standards of fair play. Footballers spiralling salaries and the millions of pounds of TV money in the game has created a view among the public that sportsmanship has suffered as a result. <br>  <br> "CIS believes in upholding the highest standards of business practice. We believe in fair play in business and as a sponsor of football we conducted the research to better understand the views of the public about sportsmanship in the game. It is rewarding to know that the public share our view of the need to play fair." <br>  <br> The research findings suggest ways in which the public believe football clubs can improve their image. Clubs should: <br> <ul><li>be rooted in their local areas and recognise the important contribution they make to their local communities</li> <br> <li>show they understand wider societal and community issues and that they care about those issues</li> <br> <li>involve more women in the running of the game  <br> demonstrate honesty and fairness by encouraging such qualities in their corporate practices</li> <br> <li>embrace notion of 'sportsmanship' and ensure players demonstrate highest standards of fair play on and off the pitch</li></ul> <br>  <br> Martin Clarke said: "By paying attention to the issues raised by the research, football clubs and players can show themselves to be good citizens. They can help to expand and redefine the idea of sportsmanship by encouraging fair play in their corporate practices as well as having their players demonstrate fair play on and off the pitch. In this way clubs can embrace sportsmanship as a means of reconciling the demands of business and professionalism with  <br> the ethical values of fair play and good citizenship and demonstrate an awareness of their role and responsibilities in the wider society."  <br>  <br> For more information contact: Rowan Andrews or Gareth Stringer at Playmaker PR 020 7813 9155/6 <br>  <br> For the CIS Press Office contact: Duncan Bowker on 0161 837 4938 <br>  <br> NOTES TO EDITORS <br>  <br>  <br> CIS is an effective force in the mass market for personal finance services.

Please note that CIS does not pay reproduction or separation charges for the publication of press releases. <br>  <br> Research: The research was commissioned by CIS and conducted by The Future Foundation during November 2001.  <br>  <br> Examples of fair play: Examples of fair play in recent years have included:  <br>  <br> In a 2000 match between West Ham and Everton, Paolo Di Canio deliberately refused to take advantage of an open goal opportunity because Everton's goalkeeper Paul Gerrard was lying injured on the ground.  <br>  <br> In a 1997 match between Liverpool and Arsenal, Robbie Fowler persuaded the referee that his team should not be awarded a penalty. Fowler denied that the Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman had fouled him.  <br>  <br> Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger offered to replay his team's 1998-99 FA Cup tie against Sheffield United. Arsenal had won the first match with an 'unsporting' goal following a Sheffield injury. All parties involved - the players, managers, club directors and the FA - immediately accepted Wenger's offer. Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman said, "If we'd gone on to win the FA Cup it would have been meaningless."  <br> Football's local heroes <br> CIS has recently launched a nationwide campaign uniting professional football clubs in a scheme which rewards the heroes of the grass roots game.  <br>  <br> CIS has rallied professional clubs from across all leagues in England, Scotland and Ireland to reward the most deserving candidates by donating the chairman's seat at a match.  <br>  <br>  <br> Manchester United has already taken the lead by making Mr Trevor Hilton from Davyhulme, Manchester, Chairman for the day. Mr Hilton was seated in the chairman's seat at Old Trafford on December 8 when West Ham were the visitors. Mr Hilton said of his experience: It was a magical day, everyone who we met could not have been more helpful and did their best to make our day perfect." Mr Hilton was awarded the treat for his services to Flixton youth team which he has been involved with since he founded the club more than 40 years ago. <br>  <br> Fellow Premiership clubs involved in the CIS Football's Local Heroes initiative include Liverpool, Blackburn Rovers, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United. North of the border nine of the twelve Scottish Premiership clubs plus a large number of clubs from the Scottish League have also committed to support the scheme.  <br>  <br> CIS is calling for nominations for the awards through the regional press to find the most dedicated volunteers who have worked tirelessly for their local grass roots football team and in return will provide new kit or equipment for the most deserving.  <br>  <br> The aim of the scheme is to reward the most dedicated people behind Britain's amateur game.
