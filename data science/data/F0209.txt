<span class=subheading>Accessing Special Folders</span>
<span class=text><p>
<p>
If you've ever needed to retrieve information about your system, you're faced with a myriad of confusing API calls. If you rely on the VB API Viewer to find some of these API calls, you're going to be missing a number of important ones that are "hidden" in the Windows shell. One of these API calls allows you to retrieve the paths to special folders on your system, such as your Favorites, your Temporary Internet Files, and more. This call is part of the Shell32.DLL library and is conspicuously absent from the API Viewer. In addition, all of the API's constants are missing. 
<p>However, if you have the Developer Network Library, you can get information about how the call works. The call's name is <b>SHGetSpecialFolderPath</b> and can be found in the library by using the index. The VB declaration for the API is shown here:
</p>
<pre>
Private Declare Function SHGetSpecialFolderPath _
   Lib "shell32.dll" _
   Alias "SHGetSpecialFolderPathA" _
   (ByVal hWnd As Long, _
   ByVal lpszPath As String, _
   ByVal nFolder As Integer, _
   ByVal fCreate As Boolean) As Boolean
</pre>
<p>
The arguments are as follows:
<ul>
<li><b>hWnd</b> - Current window handle to form you're using (accessed with Me.hWnd Property of the form). If you're in a code module, this argument can be zero with no apparent effects. 
<li><b>lpszPath</b> - Buffer for returned string. This buffer should be initialized to at least 255 space characters, as shown in the example that will follow.
<li><b>nFolder</b> - Constant specifying which special folder to return. 
<li><b>fCreate</b> - Boolean value indicating whether or not to create the folder if it doesn't exist. Be careful of this argument if you're testing your function -- you wouldn't want to create extra system folders in case of an error. 
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Finding the constants is tricky, since they are not documented in the MSDN Library. However, if you have Visual C++, you can search for the constants in the include files. Even if you're not a VC++ programmer, it's handy to keep these files around for occasions just like this. The include files are in the VC98\Include directory under the main Visual Studio directory. You can use Explorer's Find File feature to look for text in the files -- it will save you a lot of time. The constants available for the <b>nFolder</b> argument are listed below. Constants marked with <b>Version 5.0</b> are only available on systems that have Windows 2000 or Internet Explorer 5.0 installed. Also, some of the constants are only available for NT 4.0, so doublecheck the documentation before use.

This example returns the directory path of the system Start Menu, which on Windows 9x, is <i>C:\Windows\Start Menu</i>, by default. The buffer is null-terminated, so the last line finds the null terminator and returns everything to the left.
