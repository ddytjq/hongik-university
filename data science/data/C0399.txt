              to report a profit before tax of &pound;5.0 million (31 March 1998 
              - &pound;14.9 million, including &pound;9.0 million of investment 
              gains) for the nine months to 31 December 1998. Earnings per share 
              were 6.2p (31 March 1998 - 43.1p including 29.6p of investment gains). 
              The undiluted net tangible asset value per share at the year end 
              was 77.8p (31 March 1998 - 129.7p). <br>
              <br>
              Your Board has recommended a final dividend for the year of 2.0p 
              (31 March 1998 - 6.45p). The reduction in dividend reflects the 
              change in dividend policy designed to retain a higher proportion 
              of earnings to fund the growth of the Group as explained in the 
              June 1998 Listing Particulars. <br>

              Underwriting profit is derived from the Group&#146;s syndicate participations 
              on the Lloyd&#146;s 1996 year of account after making provisions 
              for syndicates expected to make losses in the 1997 and 1998 years 
              of account. </span></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top:0cm" align="left"><span class="font">The 
              merger with the HBSH Group in July 1998 has been accounted for as 
              an acquisition. Therefore only a small proportion of profit commission 
              from syndicates managed by CSL for the 1996 year of account will 
              be included above. In addition, a charge for amortisation of acquisition 
              goodwill (which is to be written-off over 20 years) has been made. 
              <br>
              <br>
              The period under review has seen significant progress in the development 
              of the Group as an Integrated Lloyd's Vehicle (ILV). The merger 
              with HBSH, the ultimate holding company of Chaucer Syndicates Limited 
              (CSL), was completed on 23 July 1998. The Company was renamed Chaucer 
              Holdings PLC to reflect the change in emphasis of the Group. <br>
              <br>
              Despite difficult underwriting conditions, I am pleased with the 
              Group&#146;s progress and am confident that it is in good shape 
              to take advantage of the opportunities which we expect to emerge.

              spread underwriting capacity was aligned with syndicates managed 
              by CSL for the 1999 account at a cost of &pound;1.9 million. The 
              balance of &pound;15.6 million has been allocated to third party

              is provided through the Group&#146;s interest in Chaucer Dedicated

              the 1996 underwriting year, the ALIT corporate members had allocated 
              capacity of &pound;58.5 million on a spread of 55 syndicates. This 
              produced a basic underwriting profit of &pound;4.0 million (6.8%). 
              After adjustment for the additional central fund levy for corporate 
              members and the special levy rebate, members&#146; agent&#146;s 
              fees and profit commission and a provision for syndicates expected 
              to make losses in the future, the contribution was &pound;1.9 million 
              (31 March 1998: &pound;6.1 million). The provision for syndicates 
              forecasting losses in the 1997 and 1998 years is &pound;2.2 million 
              (&pound;0.8 million for 1997 and &pound;1.4 million for 1998), an 
              increase of &pound;1.8 million over the corresponding provision 
              at 31 March 1998. </span></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top:0cm" align="left"><span class="font">The

              Technical Release on financial statements of Lloyd&#146;s corporate 
              members. We have used managing agents&#146; current mid-point estimates 
              (or, where relevant, by extrapolation of published comments) of 
              the results of loss making syndicates on which the Group underwrites 
              in 1997 and 1998. No account has been taken of potentially profit 
              making syndicates which for 1997, on the basis of current mid-point 
              estimates, show profits greater than the &pound;0.8 million of provisions 
              for that year. </span></p>

              1997 account on which the ALIT corporate members had allocated capacity 
              of &pound;53.2 million has been characterised by a decline in premium 
              income and continuing downward pressure on rates as underwriters 
              compete for market share. There has also been a notable increase 
              in the level of gross claims incurred by most Lloyd&#146;s syndicates 
              (particularly aviation) and the motor market has been very weak. 
              The availability of competitive reinsurance however has helped the 
              net underwriting position. Current forecasts indicate a gross underwriting 
              result in the range of 3.7% profit to a loss of 1.5% on capacity.

              underwriting capacity for the 1998 account was increased to &pound;60.3 
              million primarily in anticipation that capacity would become harder 
              and more expensive to acquire and this proved to be the case in 
              1998 as managing agents endeavoured to establish ILVs by aligning 
              capacity with managed syndicates. It is expected that underwriting 
              returns will show a further deterioration over those of 1997 reflecting 
              the continued depressed market conditions. <br>
              <br>
              As part of the strategy of realigning underwriting capacity to syndicates 
              managed by the Group, the ALIT corporate members sold or relinquished 
              &pound;44.4 million of third party capacity in the Lloyd&#146;s 
              auctions in 1998 at a profit of &pound;3.8 million. The Group is 
              likely to sell the balance of &pound;15.6 million of third party 
              capacity in this year&#146;s auctions. </span></p>

              is expected to produce a gross underwriting result of between a 
              profit of 3.0% and a loss of 2.0%. While, with the exception of 
              Syndicate 173, the managed syndicates&#146; results compare respectably 
              against their individual peer groups the trend in profitability 
              reflects the general state of the present underwriting cycle. We 
              do not expect our managed syndicates to be affected by the extended 
              warranty or &#145;Unicover&#146; losses that have been announced 
              recently. </span></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top:0cm" align="left"><span class="font">Current 
              market conditions remain extremely difficult, not just at Lloyd&#146;s 
              but in insurance markets generally. In spite of the frequency of 
              natural catastrophes and aviation losses, such as hurricanes Georges 
              and Mitch and the Swissair disaster, competition for insurance business 
              remains strong. Clients are able to negotiate increasingly wide 
              and flexible terms at highly competitive rates. It is difficult 
              to see how this situation can be sustained and there are signs that 
              some insurers have had enough and are withdrawing from the market. 
              It seems likely that further withdrawals are inevitable before markets 
              can return to sensible rating conditions. </span></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top:0cm" align="left"><span class="font">On 
              a more optimistic note there are signs that the motor market is 
              beginning to improve. Fleet rates are hardening and the private 
              car market is following suit. This is encouraging but underwriting 
              such business at Lloyd&#146;s is challenging and we continue to 
              investigate ways in which we can improve margins in this and all 
              personal lines insurance. </span></p>

              spite of market conditions we have taken the opportunity to expand 
              capacity of the syndicates managed by Chaucer for 1999 from &pound;226 
              million to &pound;257 million, a 14% increase. We decided to effect 
              this increase in order to accommodate a new aviation account within 
              Syndicate 1084 following the cessation of Syndicate 173, to take 
              advantage of an anticipated upturn in motor business and to enhance 
              our presence in the non-marine sector. <br>
              <br>
              We continue to build a strong and dynamic business at Chaucer. We 
              were pleased to be able to appoint an experienced and respected 
              aviation underwriter who came to us from Ace aviation Syndicate 
              925 to set up, with a number of his colleagues, the new aviation 
              account. Other areas in which we have begun to develop business 
              opportunities include Political Risk, Onshore Energy and a new book 
              of US binding authority business. To complement our underwriting 
              capabilities we have strengthened the management team during 1998 
              with the appointment of an Operations Director, a Group Actuary, 
              a Head of IT and a new Company Secretary. We are now confident that 
              we have in place a balanced senior executive team of underwriters 
              and managers with sufficient strength in depth to develop Chaucer 
              as an independent listed insurance business at Lloyd&#146;s. The 
              professional development of all our managers continues to be a high 
              priority. </span></p>

              CDL is a corporate member established in late 1995 to provide dedicated 
              underwriting capacity to CSL syndicates. It is owned by the Chaucer 
              Group and three external investors. At a time when raising capital 
              to support the syndicates could be difficult, CDL is an important 
              part of our capacity raising capability. CDL contributes &pound;50 
              million of the overall total managed capacity of &pound;257 million. 
              The Group has a 100% share in 1996 and 1997 profits and a 33% share 
              in 1998 and 1999 profits. Shareholders in CDL agreed an increase 
              in capacity from &pound;30 million to &pound;50 million for 1999 
              which was obtained by the purchase of additional Chaucer capacity

              before 31 March 1998, the Group switched its main investment portfolio 
              into the Aberdeen UK Growth Unit Trust, a UK equities fund. At 31 
              December 1998, the holding was 46.4 million units with a value of 
              &pound;37.9 million. As reported with the six month results to 30 
              September 1998, the fund had suffered along with the rest of the 
              UK market. It recovered well in the last three months of the year 
              to show a 0.4% gain for the nine months to 31 December 1998 which 
              compares favourably with its benchmark index (the FTSE All-Share 
              Index) which recorded a loss of 3.9%. <br>
              <br>
              Shareholders will be aware that the UK stockmarket performed strongly 
              in the latter part of 1998 and on 19 January 1999, the opportunity 
              was taken to move 40% of the Group&#146;s investments into a fixed 
              interest fund. As a result, the Company sold 18.0 million units 
              in the Aberdeen UK Growth Unit Trust to realise approximately &pound;15.0 
              million and used the proceeds to purchase 50.0 million units in 
              the Aberdeen Fixed Interest Unit Trust. The balance of the investment 
              portfolio remains invested in 28.5 million units in the Aberdeen

              Following the merger of ALIT and HBSH it became increasingly clear 
              that AUA did not form part of the long term strategy for the Group. 
              We were therefore pleased to announce the sale of AUA to the Hampden 
              Group on 22 January 1999 where it will become part of an organisation 
              committed to the future of private capital at Lloyd&#146;s and where 
              the interests of the staff of AUA should be reasonably safeguarded. 
              AUA made a loss before tax of &pound;0.1 million for the nine months

              </b><br>
              <br>
              &#145;To underwrite for income is to court disaster&#146; is a long 
              established underwriting mantra. Faced with difficult underwriting 
              conditions our approach at Chaucer remains firm. We seek to sustain 
              a core book of business while maintaining underwriting disciplines 
              established to ensure that we underwrite business which we regard 
              as properly rated and which we believe to be profitable. </span></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top:0cm" align="left"><span class="font">Shareholders 
              will appreciate that the application of such a policy means that, 
              regrettable though it is, we may be forced to under utilise our 
              capacity. We make no apology for this particularly because we believe 
              that this strategy will, in so far as it is achievable, ensure that 
              our capital providers are not exposed to unnecessary risk. In these 
              difficult conditions we remain determined to maintain underwriting 
              disciplines even if this results in poor underwriting capacity utilisation 
              and to work hard to meet client needs and develop new client markets. 
              <br>
              <br>
              The principal objectives for 1999 will be to align the remaining 
              spread capacity with our managed syndicates, to establish the new 
              aviation team which recently joined syndicate 1084 and to continue 
              the expansion of underwriting business. This expansion can be achieved 
              by establishing new businesses or entering into appropriate arrangements 
              with established insurance businesses and by attracting first class 
              individuals to bring new business to the Group. A Business Development 
              team has been set up for the purpose. On 28 April 1999 we announced 
              the creation of a new company Chaucer GmbH based in Hannover, Germany 
              to assist in development of European business for syndicates managed 
              by CSL. <br>
              <br>
              Our ultimate objective will be to capitalise the business so that 
              the Chaucer Group can supply 100% of the capacity of our own syndicates 
              over the next <br>
              three to five years. Until then we will continue to welcome capacity 
              from whatever source. We will however adopt a policy of &#147;flexible 
              response&#148; to ensure that whatever decisions underwriting members 
              of Lloyd&#146;s take about their continuing participation in the 
              market we will never be without the capacity we require to run a 
              vibrant and dynamic insurance business at Lloyd&#146;s. We do not 
              anticipate increasing managed capacity for the 2000 year of account.

              While the containment of costs remains a high priority we must also 
              ensure that our business has the facilities and resources to remain 
              competitive. New premises have been occupied in Devonshire Square 
              on the expiry of our old lease in September 1998. This has presented 
              us with the opportunity to upgrade our systems and communications. 
              In addition to installing an appropriate technology network we continue 
              to implement plans to introduce a new underwriting and management 
              information system for the Group. The motor syndicate, particularly 
              in the context of an improving motor market, has outgrown its premises 
              in Canterbury where it currently occupies two sites. After a long 
              search we have decided to meet its requirements by building new 
              offices which will be leased to the syndicate for occupation in 
              early 2000. <br>
