Ah, you chose to do the freefall thing.  Very wise.  This means you get a
great view before you are torn apart by the <a
href="inside.html#tidal">tidal
forces</a> of the black hole.  What are tidal forces?  To be painfully
brief, it's what happens when your feet are accelerating faster than your
head.  Normally, we deal with gravitational fields weak enough that this
doesn't happen on a small scale.  It <i>does</i> happen with the water of
the earth and the pull of the moon.  That's why it's called 'tidal,' as in
'pertaining to tides.'  You know that the gravitational attraction of the
moon on the earth's water deforms it into a ellipsoid, a shape very much
like a football with the sharpish edges softened.  Did that make sense?
No?  Okay, the moon's gravity makes the earth's water form two bulges: one
at the side that is closest to the moon, and one on the side that is
furthest from the moon.
<p>
Well, that deformation that happens to the water is happening to you and
your rocket.  It gets worse as time goes on.  In fact the effect is so
strong that, eventually, your body will be stretched like an image on
silly putty until it breaks.
<p>
As if this isn't bad enough, there is one more relativistic effect of
falling past the horizon that I have yet to mention: the blue sheet.  I
explain it in depth in <a href="inside.html#blue">the section about the
insides of black holes</a>, but I'll also give a brief description here.
Recall how I told you that light redshifts due to gravity?  Well, the
opposite happens inside the event horizon---the light <i>blueshifts</i>.
It's just like redshifting except it's in the opposite direction.
Redshifting decreases the frequency of a light ray, blueshifting increases
it.  Inside the event horizon, a light ray blueshifts until it becomes
what scientists call a gamma ray, the most high-energy form of light there
is.  Gamma rays are much more powerful than ultra-violet light, which most
folks consider nasty because it raises the chances of getting cancer due
to its high energy.  Imagine what gamma rays would do to ya!
<p>
Heh, so, not only are you stretched by the tidal forces, you are also
irradiated by gamma rays!  It's a good thing that the time you have left
is only about the same time it would take a light ray to cross
2R<sub>s</sub>.
<p>
<h1>Where's the great view?!?</h1>
Well, I was quite sneaky when I mentioned the "blue sheet."  That light
that got blueshifted wasn't light that fell in the event horizon from your
universe!  It did fall through the (same?) event horizon, but it came from
another universe.  It all has to do with the spacetime diagram (<a
href="spacetime.html">what's a spacetime diagram?</a>) of a static black
hole, which I detailed in <a href="inside.html">Inside 'em</a>, the
section dealing with multiple universes and the three types of black
holes.
<p>
What?  I'm confusing you?  Oh dear!
<p>
If you just want to take my word for it that light from another universe
can reach you as you freefall past the event horizon, okay; I shall just
tell you this.  After crossing the event horizon, you see a small area
which contains light from the other universe---a small area very much like
the small area that your universe became just before you crossed the event
horizon.  The difference between the two is that, when you see the light
from the other universe, it has this black band around it---that's the
black hole.  The longer you fall, the larger the other universe appears
and the closer the black band seems to be.  Eventually, the tidal forces
tear you apart.  But for that brief time, you saw the other universe; and,
if someone had fallen through the event horizon from that side, you could
meet someone from another universe.
