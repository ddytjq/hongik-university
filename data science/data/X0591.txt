    The Australian Racing Hall of Fame was launched at Crown Casino, Melbourne, at a gala
    dinner tonight (Wednesday, June 13<sup>th</sup>) attended by John Howard, Prime Minister
    of Australia, who presented the awards .<p>A total of 20 from four categories, Horses,
    Trainers, Jockeys and Associates, were inducted, with another five in each category to be
    added every two years. The Australian Racing Museum, based on Caulfield Racecourse,
    initiated the Australian Racing Hall of Fame as part of its strategy to preserve and
    promote Australia&#146;s rich racing history, an integral part of the country&#146;s
    economic and social life, commencing with the first race meeting, held at Hyde Park,
    Sydney, in 1810, but rejected calls for a larger initial intake.</p>
    <p><strong>Twenty horses were nominated, the five chosen were :-</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Carbine</strong>, born in New Zealand in 1885, is indisputably the greatest of
    all racehorses bred in the Southern Hemisphere, and one of the bravest. In 43 career
    starts, Carbine&#146;s record stands at 33-6-3, one unplaced and, from his second race,
    carrying a severe hoof injury that repeatedly burst open. An entire, he could sprint and
    he could stay, and sometimes did both on the same day. He won from five furlongs to three
    miles, racing from a 2YO to a 5YO, setting Australasian records and winning all the great
    Melbourne and Sydney races of his day, including successive Sydney Cups. In the Melbourne
    Cup of 1890 Carbine carried the greatest winning weight ever, 145 pounds, in the largest
    field ever, 39 starters, winning by 2-1/2 lengths and conceding second placed Highborn 53
    pounds.</p>
    <p>As a stallion in Australia and in England, from little opportunity, Carbine sired the
    English Derby winner Spearmint, the sire of Pluck Liege and Catnip, and so lives on in the
    pedigrees of Ribot, Star Kingdom, Never Bend, Sir Gallahad 111, Bull Dog and Quatre
    Bras11, among others.</p>
    <p><strong>Phar Lap</strong>, bred in New Zealand in 1926, became the most famous horse
    ever to race in Australia, lifting the spirits of a country in the midst of the Great
    Depression of the 1930&#146;s, and is immortalised in books, film, television, and by the
    Royal Australian Mint with a special $5 coin commemorating his 1930 Melbourne Cup win,
    while his stuffed hide is the most popular exhibit in Melbourne&#146;s Museum of Victoria.</p>
    <p>Phar Lap had 51 career starts: 37-3-2, nine unplaced, and, with Jim Pike aboard, won
    the AJC Derby, VRC Derby, SAJC King&#146;s Cup, MVRC W.S. Cox Plate, twice, and in 1930
    won on all four days of the VRC Spring Carnival including the Melbourne Cup carrying
    9stone 12 pounds. His won his last race, in Mexico, the Agua Caliente Handicap, then the
    world&#146;s richest race.</p>
    <p><strong>Tulloch</strong>, bred in New Zealand in 1954, had a 3YO career that is
    unmatched in Australian racing history, 14 wins in the season including the 1957 Caulfield
    Cup in Australian record time, and the VRC, AJC, and Queensland Derbies. </p>
    <p>Tulloch was off the track for nearly two years with an illness that almost cost him his
    life, but fought back to score five wins as a 5YO and 10 as a 6YO. In all, Tulloch had 53
    career starts: 36-12-4-, his only unplaced run was as a 6YO in the Melbourne Cup, humping
    10 stone 1 pound, too big an ask for his 15.2 hands stature.</p>
    <p><strong>Bernborough</strong>, bred in Queensland in 1939, raced in Toowoomba, but was
    soon caught up in controversy concerning his breeding and ownership, the latter only
    resolved when he was sold at public auction as a 6YO known as &#145;The Toowoomba
    Terror.&quot; Bernborough, like Phar Lap, was over 17.hh, towering over his jockeys,
    especially the one that was to make his name, Athol George Mulley.</p>
    <p>Bernborough put together an unbeaten sequence of 15 wins, including the Newmarket
    Handicap and the Doomben Cup, but was beaten into 5<sup>th</sup> in the Caulfield Cup,
    then came to grief in the McKinnon Stakes. Asked to &#145;carry the grandstand&#146; in
    many of his races, and in a career that did not really become serious until he was six,
    Bernborough paid the price and never raced again. He had 38 career starts, for 26- 2-1.
    Sold as a stallion to film mogul Louis B. Mayer, Bernborough stood at famed Spendthrift
    Stud, Kentucky. A gentle giant with a massive head and kind eye, and a wayward mane that
    flowed with the breeze, Bernborough died of a heart attack aged 20 and four months, his
    head cradled by his devoted groom Clem Brooks.</p>
    <p><strong>Kingston Town</strong>, bred in 1976, a small, rather plain gelding with a
    piece out of one ear, raced into Australian Turf history with his third successive W.S.
    Cox Plate win in 1982. He won many other top races, including the AJC Derby and Sydney
    Cup, and was a very gallant 2<sup>nd</sup> in the 1982 Melbourne Cup. In 41 career starts;
    30-5-2. Kingston Town endeared himself by his courage, always plagued by dicey, heavily
    bandaged front legs.</p>
    <p><strong>A total of 13 trainers were nominated, the five chosen :-</strong></p>
    <p>The late <strong>C.S.(Colin) Hayes, A.M. O..B.E</strong>, started off as a boilermaker
    and amateur jockey, then turned to training. He won 13 successive Melbourne Tainers&#146;
    Premierships, 28 Adelaide Trainers Premierships, a world record ten winners in a day, on
    23<sup>rd</sup> January, 1982, 2 Melbourne Cups, 3 W.S. Cox Plates, 4 VRC Derbies, and 4
    Newmarket Handicaps.</p>
    <p>He also founded the world famed Lindsay Park Stud in South Australia&#146;s Barossa
    Valley and, with his friend Robert Sangster, did not originate but did advance the concept
    of the dual hemisphere, or &#145;shuttle stallions&#146;. Among the horses Hayes trained
    were Dulcify, Rory&#146;s Jester, So Called, and Zabeel.</p>
    <p><strong>J.B. (Bart) Cummings</strong>, the &quot;Cups King&quot; with a record 11
    Melbourne Cup victories to his credit, in five of which he also trained the runner up. He

    WS Cox Plates, 3 Golden Slipper Stakes, 25 Derbies in four States, and 14 Oaks winners.
    Galilee, Let&#146;s Elope, Saintly, Light Fingers, Taj Rossi, and Think Big, are among his
    successes.</p>
    <p><strong>T.J. (Tommy) Smith</strong> dominated Sydney racing for three decades, winning
    the Premiership every year between 1953-1985. He won 2 Melbourne Cups, 3 Caulfield Cups, 7
    WS Cox Plates, 6 Golden Slipper Stakes, and 35 Derbies in seven States. Champions trained
    by Smith included Tulloch, Kingston Town, Gunsynd, Redcraze, and Red Anchor.</p>
    <p><strong>James Scobie</strong>, 1860-1940, a pre-eminent racehorse trainer who
    originally combined his training with riding over jumps, won many notable races including
    the 1887 Grand National Steeple. Scobie also trained 4 Melbourne Cup winners, 8 VRC
    Derbies, 12 Ascot Vale Stakes, and 10 Bendigo Cups.</p>
    <p><strong>M. (Jack) Holt</strong>, 1879 &#150; 1951, first a jockey, he became a trainer
    in 1902, and from 1918 won the Trainers&#146; Premiership 13 times. His most famous horses
    were Eurythmic, Hall Mark, Heroic and Chanak. He trained the winners of the Melbourne Cup,
    2 Caulifield Cups, 6 WS Cox Plates, and the VRC Derby.</p>
    <p><strong>Thirteen jockeys were nominated, the five chosen :-</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Tom Hales</strong> 1847 &#150;1901. Ran away from home in Portland, NSW, to
    become a jockey, and became a champion. Hales won all of Australia&#146;s major races, 3

    Australian Cups. He won the 1880 Melbourne Cup on the unbeaten Grand Flaneur. During the
    1888 Melbourne cup Carnival Hales rode 11 winners from 14 mounts in three days. He retired
    in 1894.</p>
    <p><strong>George Moore</strong>, teaming up with trainer Tommy Smith dominated Sydney
    racing, winning 10 jockeys Premierships between 19570-1969. His tally of 119 Group 1

    <p><strong>Roy Higgins</strong>, born in 1938, commenced his career in 1953 and went on to
    become one of Victoria&#146;s greatest jockeys. Higgins won his first Melbourne
    Jockeys&#146; Premiership in the 1964/65 season, and won it a further ten times to equal

    <p><strong>Eleven Associates were nominated, the five chosen are :-</strong></p>
    <p><strong>A.B. (Banjo) Paterson</strong>, 1864-1941, became one of Australia&#146;s
    greatest writers on racing and its characters and was dubbed &#145;the supreme balladist
    of the horse&#146;.</p>
    <p>From an early career as a jumps jockey and serving as a mounted Correspondent during
    the Boer War, Paterson later became Editor of The Sportsman. His poems included A Dream of
    the Melbourne Cup, Only A Jockey, Tommy Corrigan and In The Stable. Novels included The
    Shearer&#146;s Colt, and his most famous work, The Man From Snowy River, later made into a
    highly successful film and later a television series.</p>
    <p><strong>The Thompson Family</strong> of Widden Stud. Established by John Thompson in
    1867 Widden Stud is thought to be the world&#146;s oldest stud in unbroken father-to-son
    ownership. Australian Champion Sires who have stood at Widden include Lockiel, 4 times
    Champion Sire; Grafton, 4 times; Malster, 5 times; Bletchingly, 3 times, Vain, once, and
    Marscay, twice. Other famous Widden stallions include Heroic, Ajax and Todman. Alfred
    Thompson and his son Frank played a significant role in racing administration, serving on
    the Australian Jockey Club Committee for many years.</p>
    <p><strong>Sir Adrian Knox, P.C. K.C.M.G</strong>, widely regarded as one of the greatest
    ever administrators of Australian racing. Knox was Chairman of the Australian Jockey Club
    from 1906 to 1919, and introduced many revolutionary changes. He was responsible for the
    introduction of the totalisator in Randwick, an innovation which spread to all other major
    race clubs across the country. He also raced many horses, including the 1910 Sydney Cup
    winner Vavasor.</p>
    <p><strong>Sir Chester Manifold</strong>, 1897-1979, served on the Committee of the
    Victoria Racing Club from 1937-1972, including 11 years as Chairman. He is seen as largely
    responsible for the introduction of the Totalisator Agency Board (TAB) to Victoria, seeing
    it as the best means of channeling back into racing the vast sums of money lost to illegal
    bookmakers. He served as the first chairman of the TAB. He had great success as an
    owner-breeder. His best known horse was the outstanding steeplechaser CRISP, so narrowly
    beaten in the 1973 Grand National at Aintree, England.</p>
    <p><strong>William Henry (Bill) Collins</strong>, OAM, 1928-1997, widely acclaimed as
    Australia&#146;s greatest racecaller, with an uncanny ability to correctly call the result
    of even the closest finish. Collins called important races in the UK, USA, South Africa,
    New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore. He called his last race in 1987.&nbsp;</td>
