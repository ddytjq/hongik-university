  THE ACCOUNT<br></b></font>
  Falcon Mini Cash ISA (Individual Savings Account) has been developed following Government guidelines to offer a method of saving which is completely tax free. It offers a higher rate of interest than many other savings accounts and can be opened with a minimum of £100. The benefits of tax free savings are so good that the Inland Revenue will only allow the opening of one Mini Cash ISA per person. Accounts cannot be opened in another name and joint accounts are not allowed.
  <br><br>
  ISAs are not term investments although their tax free status is expected to last for a period of 10 years from introduction in 1999. You do not have to maintain your commitment to your ISA for a set period. You choose the length of time you wish the account to remain open.
  <br><br>
  An ISA is made up of one or more of the following components:-
  <ul type=round>
  	<li>A stocks and shares component
  	<li>A cash component
  	<li>An insurance component
  </ul>
  The ISA provider will designate ISAs into categories:-
  <ul type=round>
    <li>Maxi ISA
  	<li>Mini ISA
  	<li>TESSA Only ISA
  </ul>
  MAXI ACCOUNT
  <br>
  Must be made up of stocks and shares component (with or without the cash or insurance component). By investing in a Maxi account, the only other account that may be subscribed to in that tax year, is a TESSA Only ISA.
  <br><br>
  MINI ACCOUNT
  <br>
  Must be made up of a single specified component. By investing in a Mini account, the only other accounts which may be subscribed to in that tax year, are a TESSA Only or a Mini account made up of a different component.
  <br><br>
  TESSA Only ACCOUNT
  <br>
  Must be made up of a cash component only, accepting matured TESSA capital but excluding interest.
  <br><br>
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>BARNSLEY ISAs</b></font>
  <br>
  The Barnsley Building Society will operate ISAs on the following basis only:-
  <ul type=none>
    <li>Mini Cash ISA
        <br>Accepting a cash only component. (Please note: If you do not already have a Mini Stocks and Shares or an Insurance ISA, you may be limiting the amount of tax free savings you could take advantage of in equities.)
    <br><br>
    <li>TESSA Only ISA
        <br>Accepting matured TESSA cash capital only. (This account can accept annual interest generated from the initial TESSA deposit, however, interest from the matured TESSA capital, used to open the account, must be deposited into another account.)
  </ul>
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>CAT STANDARDS</b></font>
  <br>
  The Government has set out voluntary standards for ISA products in respect of Charges, Access and Terms. These are known as CAT standards. However where an ISA account meets CAT standards, the Government wishes it to be known:-
  <ul type=none>
    <li>A CAT standard ISA is not Government approved.
    <li>The CAT standard ISA performance is not guaranteed.
    <li>The CAT standard ISA may not always be suitable for savers.
  </ul>
  The Society's ISA account is not CAT standard.
  <br><br>
  ISA providers do not have to conform to these standards as they are not a guarantee of future performance and a non CAT ISA is not necessarily an inferior product. The most suitable product for you will depend upon your needs and circumstances.
  <br><br>
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>INVESTMENTS</b></font>
  <br>
  You can invest and withdraw from a Falcon Mini Cash ISA Account at any time. However, as a tax-free account, an investment limit applies and this must not be exceeded during that tax year. The investment limit until April 2005 is £3,000. Should you place the maximum into an account and then withdraw funds, you will not be permitted to make any further investments. Accordingly, if you do not invest the maximum in that tax year, the remainder cannot be rolled over into the next tax year. The pre-set limits may not be exceeded under any circumstance.
  <br><br>
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>HOW TO OPEN YOUR FALCON ISA</b></font>
  <br>
  Your Falcon Mini Cash ISA can be opened at any Society Branch or Agency. If you are a new investor with the Society you will be asked to provide one form of personal identification and another for address verification. A list of the acceptable items is displayed in all Branches and Agencies and a copy will be made available on request. As you will be opening a Tax-Free account, the account opening has to meet with Inland Revenue regulations and you will be required to provide your National Insurance number. All requests for identification are standard and conform to regulations which protect you as the Customer and guard against fraudulent transactions.
  <br><br>
  <font color="#ef6b00"><b>INTEREST PAYMENTS</b></font>
  <br>
  Interest rates on the account are variable and may fluctuate over a given period.
  <br><br>
  All Falcon ISAs will be credited with interest annually on 31st December. You may withdraw funds at any time without losing the original tax free status.
  <br><br>
  Current interest rates will be supplied to you on request and are on display at all Branch and Agency offices.

  <br>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ISSUE</b></font>
  <ol>
    <li>ELIGIBILITY - You may open an account if you are an individual aged 16 years and over. You must be resident in the UK and subject to UK tax. As ISA stands for Individual Savings Account, accounts cannot be opened for anyone else and joint accounts are not permitted.
        <br><br>
    <li>INVESTMENTS - Each account is subject to a minimum initial investment of £100 and additional sums of any amount may be invested at any time up to a limit of £3,000 per year..
        <br><br>
    <li>COOLING OFF PERIOD - If, after careful consideration, you decide that you are not happy with your choice of savings or investment account(s) and you bring this to our attention within 14 days of your initial receipt, we will help you to either switch accounts or return your money with any interest earned over that period*. We will ignore any notice periods and additional charges in these cases.
        <br><br>*Please note: Cheques paid in within the 14 day period will have to clear before a refund can be given. 
        <br>
    <li>WITHDRAWALS - can be made immediately. 
        <br><br>In practice the Society allows withdrawals up to £500 cash or up to the account balance by cheque, to be available immediately at any Branch office. Withdrawals are also available at the Society's Agencies - up to £300 in cash and up to the account balance by cheque, but prior notice may be required.
        <br><br>
    <li>INTEREST - is variable and calculated on a daily basis, including the day of receipt but excluding the day of withdrawal and added to the account each year on 31st December. Interest can be paid into another account with the Society.
        <br><br>
        ADDITIONAL INTEREST - becomes payable when the account balance reaches £500, and £1,000. Conversely, when an account balance falls below these levels, the interest rate payable will reduce accordingly.
        <br><br>
    <li>INTEREST RATES - We reserve the right to amend interest rates at our discretion using one or more of the following methods:-
      <br><br>
      <ol>
        <li>Advertisements in the Yorkshire Post and Derbyshire Times Newspapers
        <li>Notice in Branch and Agency Offices
        <li>Individual notification to investors
        <li>Internet - Society Website
      </ol><br>
    <li>CLOSURE - Should your account fall below the minimum amount of £100, the account will be closed and the balance transferred again to a Falcon Instant Access account, where interest will be payable net of lower rate income tax.
        <br><br>
    <li>TRANSFERS - At the request of the investor and within such time as shall be agreed, an ISA with all rights and obligations of the parties to it, may be transferred to another ISA manager.
        <br><br>If your ISA is held with another provider you may wish to transfer your account to the Society. On receipt of your instructions, we will arrange the transfer on your behalf. All transfers either to or from the Society can be dealt with at your local Branch.
        <br><br>
    <li>ISA REGULATIONS - The Barnsley ISA does not conform to the Government CAT standards. ISAs may not be suitable for you as the value of tax benefits depends upon your personal financial circumstances.
        <br><br>ISA investments will be, and must remainin, the beneficial ownership of the investor and must not be used as a security for a loan.
        <br><br>The ISA manager will satisfy himself that any person to whom he delegates any of his functions or responsibilities under the terms agreed with the investor is competent to carry out those functions and responsibilities.
        <br><br>The ISA manager must notify the investor if, by reason of any failure to satisfy the provisions of the ISA regulations, an ISA has, or will, become void.
       <br><br>
    <li>AMENDMENTS - We reserve the right to amend Terms and Conditions of Issue at our discretion. Should the change be to your disadvantage, we will tell you about it personally, at least 30 days before we make the change.
      <br><br>
  </ol>
  These terms and conditions are subject to change in response to the Government's statutory requirements regarding ISAs.
