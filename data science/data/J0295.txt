									<font face="Arial Black" color="#0000cd" size="4"><strong>ABOUT US</strong></font></div>
								<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">The concept for JobsInMotorsports.com&#153; has been developing for some time. This site was originally the Internet presence of </font><a href="http://www.motorsportsrecruiting.com/index.html"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#0000cd" size="2"><b>Motorsports Recruiting&#153;</b></font></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">, an executive recruiting firm specializing in the motorsports industry. The JobsInMotorsports.com website has been visited by several thousand people a month since its inception. Many of these people have chosen to send us their resumes and/or to sign up for our newsletter notifying them of positions Motorsports Recruiting was conducting searches for.<br>
								</font></p>
								<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">This created a dilemma. As a small, specialist executive recruiting firm, Motorsports Recruiting works on only a handful of placements each year. We only place people when employers hire us to find someone for a specific opening. Yet, the number of candidates seeking our help finding positions in racing, sending us resumes or subscribing to our newsletter numbered in the thousands and was growing steadily. Most of these people were seeking lower level positions that motorsports employers do not use recruiters to fill. The result was something of a guilt factor. We felt responsible to somehow be of assistance to everyone who took the time to visit our site, join our mailing list or send a resume, but our traditional executive recruiting services weren't going to cut it.<br>
								</font></p>
								<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">At the same time, our motorsports employer clients struggle daily with challenges of staffing their organizations. Finding an electrician for a racetrack or a parts counterman for a race team shop could be more difficult than finding a crew chief or team manager. The decisionmakers may know numerous crew chiefs from his racing circle of contacts but isn't likely to know a lot of parts countermen. As recruiters, we couldn't help with these challenges because the fees we need to charge to spend hundreds of man-hours tracking down just the right candidate couldn't be justified for these positions.<br>
								</font></p>
								<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">It seemed pretty obvious that there was a need for some mechanism to connect candidates with employers but the traditional web job bank concept had an inherent problem: expense. Internet job banks cost the employer thousands of dollars per year and many motorsports employers simply cannot afford it or justify it when most of the people with resumes in those job banks have no special motorsports related skills or interest in working in the industry.<br>
								</font></p>
								<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">In time, the light bulbs lit up and the JobsInMotorsports.com concept developed: provide a specialized conduit for motorsports candidates to send their resume information directly to the motorsports employers they are interested in. Lots of candidates could pay a small, easily manageable fee so that the employers would not have to pay a large, unmanageable fee (no apologies here...with its narrow focus, this site is not going to generate the revenues of a Monster.com but we do expect it to pay its own way and justify the effort to contact and enroll all the employers). In this way, JobsInMotorsports.com can be very valuable to both employer and candidate and facilitate their getting together. </font></p>
								<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">So, JobsInMotorsports.com was created using the industry contacts of Motorsports Recruiting and began operation in the fall of 2001. We offer the employers easy (and free) access to candidates with the right skills and an enthusiasm for motorsports and candidates a unique method of getting their resumes into the hands of employers instead of passively waiting for someone to contact them from their posting on a job bank.<br>
								</font></p>
								<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="black" size="2">We believe we have a formula that benefits everyone and hope that everyone that uses it finds it of value. We wish everyone the best in their motorsports endeavors.<br>
