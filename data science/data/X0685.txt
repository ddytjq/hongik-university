<h2>Discipline</h2>

<h2><span id="item1" class="NoHighlight" style="cursor: hand;">Introduction</span></h2>

<p>Notice: This article was written by Steve Jordan, <a href="http://www.alaskalife.net/sjordan/notebook/">Coach's
Notebook. </a>Email the author at <a href="mailto:sjordan@alaskalife.net.">sjordan@alaskalife.net.</a></p>

<p>Coaching basketball is a whole lot of fun. Practices are hard work, but  the preparation fosters a sense of  anticipation and  excitement for either an up-coming game or for your players' undefined, yet promising future in basketball.  If you recently  had a game, there are likely specific improvements to work on or perhaps new plays to cover unexpected situations that arose. Still, that excitement is there because you know that after you have practiced properly, the team will be better than before. In fact, an ideal basketball season is one where over time, a team steadily transforms from a collection of individuals with assorted talents into a unified force with a common goal of playing the best basketball possible.
Well, that sounds nice, but don't expect it to happen that way. The road a team actually follows throughout the season is anything but a straight line. There are not only ups and downs, but continual stoppages and detours for construction, too.</p>

<p>Why is the road to good basketball so convoluted? The challenge of bringing a group of people together to accomplish something significant is difficult. The members of the group not only have different talents and skills, they also have different reasons for being there in the first place. A basketball team is a set of persons. Each person is a complex set of variables. The resulting equation is a long one, and the result changes all the time.  The point here is this: no matter how clearly you see your objective, no matter how straight you drive to your goal, your players will wander along the way. Expect it.
How a coach approaches and enforces disciplinary measures is critical to team survival. For example, a coach can ruin a team by being either
too lax or too harsh. Players will lose interest and quit if their teammates are out of control or if the coach takes the fun out of the game through over-controlling or implementing excessively punitive actions.</p>

<p>So, what do you do when you came to practice with a carefully prepared plan on your clipboard and looking forward to a productive practice, only to find the team frustrated because one or more individuals seem intent on sabotaging their efforts?</p>

<h2><span id="item2" class="NoHighlight" style="cursor: hand;">Recognize the Symptoms</span></h2>

<p>The following behaviors suggest that a player isn't fully committed to the team. But, before taking disciplinary action, make sure you have a clue as to the cause of the behavior. Unfair dispensation of punishment not only alienates the affected player, but it may outrage the entire team. If you observe these behaviors (or others you feel are relevant), start asking questions.
Perhaps the player is being rude, lazy or irresponsible. Or, maybe, there are alternative causes behind the behavior.<br>

      may care intensely about basketball, but does poorly in school.&nbsp;</td>
      <td width="400" valign="top">Poor grades eventually overcome the player. Schools will impose
        ineligibility or parents will ground the child. The coach must support
        these actions because 1. you can't change them and 2. good grades are
        far more important to the player than good basketball skills.</td>

      </td>
      <td width="400" valign="top">Teenagers are naturally learning to be independent. Sometimes a maverick just needs one, quirky little way to be different to be satisfied. It is better to concede
       some dictates of style if the result is uniformity in team play.

        individual clearly wants to be identified with other people besides teammates.
      </td>
      <td width="400" valign="top"> Some social stigma is at work. As long as it is more important to the player
        than basketball, not much hope.</td>

    <tr>
      <td width="288" valign="top"><b>4. Doesn't follow directions in practice</b>
        - Despite careful instructions, player does the opposite in practice and repeats mistakes.
      </td>
      <td width="400" valign="top">A player may seem rebellious, but it is quite possible your directions are not understood. There may be cultural language differences. Perhaps the player's basketball background is insufficient
        to understand your terms and concepts. Maybe the child simply has weak comprehension abilities. Then, too,
        Some players avoid changes in play so they won't
      look bad. They need to be sold on the potential gains technique will bring.</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td width="288" valign="top"><b>5. Not attentive</b> - Player is clearly distracted when you are addressing the team.
      </td>
      <td width="400" valign="top">Although the player appears bored, chances are he/she has poor listening skills.
        Teach them how to listen: eye contact, nods, verbal feedback.</td>

      <td width="288" valign="top"><b>6. Disrespectful to teammates and/or coaches</b>
        - This team-killing cancer must be remedied as soon as possible.
      </td>
      <td width="400" valign="top">Behavior may be family induced or indicative of emotional problems. Sometimes you try to
        talk to parents about respect issues and, from the parents reaction, its readily apparent where the problem started. Teach the player traits of
        respectful behavior. They may not know!</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td width="288" valign="top"><b>7. Inordinate frustration</b> - Players loses self control in practice, particularly after missing a shot or committing a turnover.
      </td>
      <td width="400" valign="top">Younger
        players may simply be too immature to deal with failure. Sports can help
        a child learn that it is OK and necessary to make mistakes while trying
        to improve. Don't preach that message and then criticize players. Show
        patience and gratitude for effort and creativity. Also, consider if
        parental pressure is too great. Some parents raise the bar too high and
        the kids finally crack in practice or in the middle of the game.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="288" valign="top"><b>8. Unusually Tired</b> - Player
        is often sluggish. Concentration is poor and performance of finesse
        skills suffers.</td>
      <td width="400" valign="top">There are three common reasons for a player being weary: the player is sick, didn't sleep or is physically unfit.
        The answers are: rest when you are sick, get enough sleep and work hard at conditioning.

      <tr>
      <td width="288" valign="top"><b>9. Constantly makes excuses</b> - Places blame on teammates, coaches, referees,
        etc. This is a very annoying and very correctable habit.
  </td>      
  <td width="400" valign="top">Player must take personal responsibility for results on the floor. Blame
        placement is counter-productive. Don't condone it. Ever.</td>
    </tr>

      </td>

        playground. Worse, parents or peers may encourage personal glory.</td>

<h2><span id="item3" class="NoHighlight" style="cursor: hand;">Disciplinary Measures that Work</span></h2>

<p>This list is in order of increasing magnitude. Sometimes a player behaves so badly that you may need to go pretty far down the list, but at least consider the steps in order. Its important to act, but also important not to over-react. You're dealing with kids, somebody else's kids at that, and have a responsibility to treat them fairly.&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
<li><b>State the Rules - Clearly. </b>It's impossible to dispense discipline fairly if the rules are unknown or if they change all the time. With experience, you will develop a list if rules that work for you. Until then, it is interesting to listen to other coaches and hear what they insist upon. Remember, if you make it a rule, you must stand by it. Some coaches draft contracts and have the players and parents sign them. You may also state the rules in a letter or in a pre-season meeting. If your team is part of a larger program (like a school team or the YMCA) make sure the rules don't conflict with the administration or the head coach.</li>
<li><b>Time out. </b>For elementary aged kids, an effective method for kids that are too hyper or ornery, is to tell them to sit down and watch. They are not allowed to leave. They may rejoin the practice when they are ready to behave. This method works very well - so much better than raising your voice, which indicates loss of control.</li>
<li><b>Punitive drills and exercises. </b>Many coaches require pushups or wind sprints to counter behavior problems. It is preferable to motivate kids with a reward rather than a punishment. But, if you feel the situation deserves a physical response, have the entire team participate, even if only a couple of players are responsible for the interruption. Peer pressure is powerful.</li>
</ol>
<p>If things have degenerated to this point, it's time for a serious discussion with the player. The following steps should involve the player's parents. If you leave the parents out of the process, they will soon insert themselves into the process in an adversarial capacity. Generally parents will be quite supportive with discipline as long as they are informed and there is a sense of fairness.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><b>Loss of playing time. </b>Players hate to sit. If they lose a quarter of a game, or even an entire game, due to their behavior then they usually straighten up. Be sure that you are in compliance with league rules that may stipulate exceptions to minimum playing time.</li>
<li><b>Suspension. </b>In serious incidents, or cases where everything less drastic has failed, it may be necessary to suspend a player for multiple
  games. Before you pronounce such a sentence, talk with your administration and the parents. You can't afford to be over-ruled at this point.</li> 
<li><b>Removal from team. </b>Obviously, this is the ultimate discipline and the most unfortunate. Nobody wins. But expulsion from the team may be the only way for a team to return to a healthy state. Again, obtain the approval of the necessary administrative people.</li>
</ol>

<h2><span id="item4" class="NoHighlight" style="cursor: hand;">Disciplinary Measures that Work</span></h2>

<p>This list is short, fortunately, but it includes actions that a coach must avoid. Any one of these can injure a child, put you in trouble and may even cost you your coaching position.</p>
<ol><li><b>Verbal Abuse. </b> Many coaches, in their enthusiasm and competitive spirit, have a very vocal style. It's OK to be loud and it's OK to be verbose. But when instructions to a player cross the line into a harangue, it's time to take a break. In the heat of the moment, when emotions run high, it's easy to be critical. As the coach, you need to keep a clear head. The players are emotionally involved, too. To perform well, they need to be able to settle down and focus on the task at hand. That is so much more difficult when you feel humiliated. Imagine for a moment that you have just committed a foolish turnover. The other team recovered the ball and scored. You are so
    embarrassed. On top of that, the coach is yelling at you in front of the entire audience. Under such treatment, players learn to avoid taking risks and in doing normal skills, become too careful. It's hard to succeed when you are hesitant.</li>
<li><b>Profanity.</b> Some well known coaches that are famous for their flamboyance
  will use profanity in public. When profanity comes from a coach of children playing a wholesome sport, it is an ugly thing. Keep it clean and you will keep your respect.</li>
<li><b>Personal Contact.</b> You need to be careful these days in how you touch your kids. Don't swat them on the butt. Don't touch their face. If it is necessary to move them around in a practice, pull the shirt or guide them by the shoulders. Other than that, hands off. Your most innocent, well-intentioned efforts may be misconstrued.</li>
<li><b>Individual Humiliation.</b> You may need to strongly address the team's performance. Do not single out an individual player in front of the team. Everybody knows who did what. Public humiliation can crush a player's confidence.
  If you are really steamed at a player, even if the emotion feels fully
  justified, your emotional level should signal you to realize that you must
  calm down before you say anything or do anything. When people speak and act
  while greatly upset, they usually end up trying to heal the damage caused. So,
  if you are angry, say something like &quot;We'll talk later.&quot; and discuss
  the issue when you are fully under control.</li>
