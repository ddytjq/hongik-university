FUTURE OF REGIONAL ASSOCIATIONS</font></font></font></u></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><u><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A REPORT BY THE RACMSA REGIONAL COMMITTEE</font></u></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">August 1997</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><u><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Background</font></u></b></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The RACMSA held a series
of 12 Club Workshops throughout the UK during spring 1996, to encourage
a wider understanding of the problems that affect Motor Clubs and to consider
ways to resolve them. The report was presented by Stuart Turner to the
RACMSA Regional Committee in September 1996.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;Following discussion
at that meeting a Regional Committee Break-out day was arranged at the
Sports Council National Centre at Bisham Abbey in early December 1996,
and areas for further study and debate arising therefrom encompassed the
existing role of Regional Associations and the identification of key objectives
for their future.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;The March 1997 RACMSA
Regional Committee meeting identified four representative groups of Regional
Associations to research particular topics, and the collated views of those
groups were reported back to the following RACMSA Regional Committee meeting
in June 1997.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;This report summarises
the points made at that meeting, and makes recommendations drawn from those
points and from the subsequent discussions of the appointed Regional Committee
Working Group, who were empowered to produce this final document for the
endorsement of the Regional Committee, and the approval of the RAC Motor
Sports Council, at their meetings in September 1997.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<center>
<p><b><u><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Group Reports</font></u></b></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;<b><i>Group 1 - Marketing</i></b></font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>What are the benefits
(to member clubs and their individual members) of Regional Association
membership, and how can Regional Associations best market themselves to
attract new members?</font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;It was felt that the
<u>image</u> of a Regional Association had to be positive, and that its
level of professionalism would first be evident through its style of correspondence
or communication.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>There was a growing feeling
that despite the fact that Regional Association Officials were all volunteers,
today there was nevertheless a need to display a high level of professionalism
in all tasks undertaken.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;Association <u>Championships</u>
were the obvious focus for individual Club Members in any area, and it
was evident that the strength or success of Association Championships were
generally proportional to the perceived (or real) strength or success of
Associations themselves. There was a strong argument to support a wide
variety of Association Championships, but with each having a selected and
limited number of rounds, in order to encourage the maintenance of high
standards of quality amongst organising Member Clubs. The need for Regional
Associations to think laterally about their Championships could be the
conduit to wider membership (e.g. 4WD Championship, One-make Clubs Championship).</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;In order to attract
and maintain the support and understanding of Member Clubs, it was considered
essential that regional Associations display an open (and not clandestine)
style of <u>management</u>, with decisions being made democratically and
fully explained to non-attendees through suitable publicity. The financing
of Regional Associations currently relied on subscription income for day
to day management, but with increasing demands and the need to be represented
in other forums within the Regional or Local communities served, it was
felt that the increasing of subscription costs may be the only way to achieve
any increased level of service required.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;There was considerable
variety in the ways that individual Regional Associations communicate with
their Clubs, some offering excellent News Bulletins at regular intervals
whilst other were more limited to circulating minutes of meetings held.
It was considered that a twin track of communication should exist, with
Regional Associations not being reliant wholly on feedback from their Member
Club delegates attending Association meetings.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;The recent introduction
of RACMSA Regional Committee extracts in the 'Wheels' publication was quoted
as an example of good practice in this respect. It was also felt that Regional
Association Officials should know and be known more to their Member Clubs,
perhaps hosting or attending seminars or roadshows, and obtaining feedback
on what their customers wanted in order to continuously re-appraise the
services offered to match changing needs and expectations.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;Within all decisions
taken, it was felt important for Regional Associations to build and demonstrate
<u>credibility</u>
to their Member Clubs, but also to all other agencies with whom it networked.
The building of the credibility over a long period of time was a cornerstone
of the effectiveness with which a Regional Association would be viewed,
leading to a professional level of respect.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;<b><i>Group 2 - Motivation</i></b></font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>How can we best maintain
and improve relationships between the Regional Associations and the existing
member clubs, championship contenders and competitors?</font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;The group agreed that
people in general only support that which is of value to them, and that
this would encompass something offering monetary value as well as satisfaction
level. Generally, it is felt that most Regional Associations are currently
weak in the area of negotiating for the members of their Member Clubs such
as discounts for local products and services.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;To gain the respect
of Clubs, it was considered that Regional Associations should be given
greater authority by the RACMSA in the co-ordination of Motor Club activities.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;However, it was important
that the Regional Associations remained in ownership of the collective
member clubs, with open management and the opportunity to be represented
as Association officers or committee members, alongside all dealings with
Clubs being conducted in a well organised and professional manner.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;Regional Associations
should be seen as knowledgeable providers of information, with contactable
officers who will freely give individuals and Clubs advice, time and assistance
as required. Communications to Clubs should be directed accurately to ensure
that information from Associations reaches those individuals at whom it
is targeted.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;The organisation and
management of Association Championships was seen as a key issue - some
Associations had appointed their own Championship Co-ordinators and Competitor's
Representatives for different branches of the sport. It was also felt that
Regional Associations had a role to play in encouraging other inter-club
social or competitive activities.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;On balance it was considered
that the demonstration of enthusiasm and self-motivation by Association
Officials themselves created a positive environment which could overcome
apathetic approaches and 'rub-off' on Club delegates who would gain a greater
insight and understanding of the work done by Associations on behalf of
their member clubs.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Group 3 - What is the
role of Regional Associations within their own regions in terms of liaising
with other organisations and agencies, and what problems, challenges and
opportunities does such networking provide?</font></font></i></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;It was accepted that
all Regional Associations have individual needs and that, to reflect the
varying local patterns of motorsport nationwide, all are to some extent
different to each other.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;However, today there
is a need to strengthen links with other statutory and non-statutory agencies
if the profile of motorsport was to be maintained vis-a-vis other sports
and leisure activities, and it was felt that Associations were in a unique
position to add weight to the negotiations of Clubs with those various
bodies. The list of agencies would vary from Region to Region and no list
would be exhaustive, but typically may include such as Local Authorities,
Regional Authorities, Police, Forestry Commission, Landowners, Sports Councils,
Defence Land Agency, National Trust, National Farmers Union and Environment
Agency.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;It was felt that Regional
Associations should be a first point of contact with media in the region
(on matters of Regional or local motor sport interest), and that they could
also assist in identifying funding opportunities at Regional or Local level.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;All Regional Associations
should also maintain links for input into their regional Development Plan,
this being seen as a valuable tool for the promotion of motorsport in general
and the Regional Association in particular to such as the planning departments
of numerous agencies.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;A prerequisite for
such a role would be the acknowledgement (either formally or informally)
that the Regional Associations could act with the support of the RACMSA
on appropriate matters.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;In the longer term,
it was felt that the volunteer nature of Regional Association Officials
would be a limiting factor to the available commitment as needs expanded,
and that the establishment of Motorsport Development Officer(s) as appropriate,
directly responsible to the RACMSA, should be strongly recommended to underpin
the future development of Regional Associations and motor sport activity
in the regions.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;<b>Group 4 - Define
terms of reference for Regional Associations</b>.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Previous discussion groups
within RACMSA Regional Committee and its predecessors over many years had
failed to identify formal terms of reference for Regional Associations,
and the current definitions utilised had been arrived at on a historical
and somewhat ad-hoc basis</font></font></i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;It was greed that a
brief, clear, but flexible definition was now required, accepting that
there were important local variations in the operation of individual Regional
Associations, reflecting the different mix of motor sport disciplines represented
in each region.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;After a consultation
exercise involving all Regional Associations, the following provisional
definition was suggested as a basis for further discussion by the Working
Group*:</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>[see attached recommendations
for final agreed definition]</font></font></i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;"A Regional Association
is an association of organising motor sports clubs, registered with the
RACMSA, which exists to represent the interests and views of those Clubs
according to need, within the area of interest of the Association."</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>&nbsp;
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>&nbsp;<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>"Each individual Regional
Association acts as an advisory and liaison body between motor sport clubs
and their members and the RACMSA, and through the forum of the RACMSA Regional
Committee, is responsible to the RAC Motor Sports Council".</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;The following statement
to support the core definition was also suggested as a basis for further
discussion by the Working Group*:</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>[*-- see attached recommendations
for final agreed definition]</font></font></i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;"Membership of Regional
Associations enables Clubs to access a wealth of accumulated experience
and guidance across a broad spectrum of motor sport, and to widen the number
of events and Championships in which Club members can compete. Regional
Associations can also provide a forum for general interaction between Clubs
(including the arbitration of disputes), the promotion of training, and
discussion on proposed rule changes.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;Regional Associations
additionally have special responsibility for matters which may include:
Promotion of Regional Championships, Liaison with RACMSA Officials (<i>e.g.</i>
Route and Forestry Liaison) and other Statutory Agencies, Arrangement of
Fixture Lists'.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<center>
<p><b><u><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Recommendations</font></u></b></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;The following recommendations
are made, for consideration of action in the relevant forums, arising from
the points summarised in the aforegoing report.</font></font>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The core definition of "Regional
Association'" to be agreed:</font></font></li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;"A Regional Association
is an association of RACMSA registered motor clubs. The Association is
recognised by, and has the full support of, the RACMSA, and exists to represent
the interests and views of the member Clubs according to need, within their
area of defined responsibility, and in those areas where their members
are active.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Each individual Regional
Association is<b> </b>empowered by the RACMSA to manage agreed aspects

Regional Committee, each Association is responsible to the RAC Motor Sports
Council'</font></font>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The supporting statement equally
to be agreed:</font></font></li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;'Membership of
Regional Associations enables Clubs to have direct contact with RACMSA
Officials and Committee Members in their locality and to access a wealth
of accumulated experience and guidance across a broad spectrum of motor
sport. Membership widens the number of events and Championships in which
Club members can compete. Regional Associations provide a forum for general
interaction between Clubs, including discussion on proposed rule changes,
development of safety measures, the arbitration of disputes, and the promotion
of training.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>&nbsp;Regional Associations
will also have specific responsibility for other matters which would typically
include.</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Promotion of regional championships
and arrangements for annual awards presentations.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Reporting on topics highlighted
by RACMSA Specialist Committees Liaison with RACMSA licensed officials,
event organisers, and competitors</font></font></li>

local fixture lists</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Liaison with statutory and other
agencies (to include Sports Councils, Local Authorities, Police and Government
Departments). Liaison with other local sports and community based organisations.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Acting as first point of contact
with the media on matters of regional significance</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Local appointment of championship
co-ordinators to regulate and control championships"</font></font></li>
</ul>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>That information sent out to
Clubs applying for RACMSA recognition include details of Regional Associations,
with core definition and supporting statement, with a strong recommendation
that Clubs affiliate to at least one such Association.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>That a 'Club manual' insert
on best practice guidelines for Regional Associations be produced as an
"aide memoir".</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>That the Regional Committee
information now extracted into 'Wheels' publication be continued as a means
of widening communication direct to Clubs and individual Club members.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>That the RACMSA undertake an
awareness campaign to publicise the benefits of Regional Association membership
to <u>all</u> Motor Clubs, with a view to making membership of at least
one Regional Association mandatory from 1<sup>st</sup> January 1999.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>That research be undertaken
to investigate the principle of establishing Motorsport Development Officers
at Regional level or above, appointed by the RACMSA, to collate and develop
motorsport activities in the regions.</font></font></li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>These recommendations
