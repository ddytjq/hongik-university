<h1>ARTICLE I - GENERAL</h1>

<ul>
    <li><a name="101"></a><b>101 WFDF Rules:</b> The World Flying
        Disc Federation (hereinafter referred to as
        &quot;WFDF&quot;) is a nonprofit Federation organized and
        existing under a set of by-laws known as the WFDF
        Statutes. WFDF shall promulgate, publish and enforce
        specific rules of play for each sport or event. These
        rules shall be set forth in separate articles with each
        Article setting forth rules for a specific event, with
        the exception that field events, due to their simplicity
        and similarity, shall all come under the heading of one
        article.</li>
    <li><a name="102"></a><b>102 Spirit of the Rules:</b> Flying
        disc sports have traditionally relied upon a spirit of
        sportsmanship which places the responsibility of fair
        play on the players themselves. Highly competitive and
        committed play is encouraged, but never at the expense of
        the bond of mutual respect between players, adherence to
        the agreed upon rules of any event, nor the basic
        enjoyment of play. Protection of these vital elements
        serves to eliminate adverse conduct from the playing
        field. The responsibility for the maintenance of this
        spirit rests on each player's shoulders.</li>
    <li><a name="103"></a><b>103 Construction of the Rules:</b>
        Any rule set forth in Articles II through VIII shall be
        construed in accordance with the purpose for the rule, in
        a manner of consistency and fairness, exercising
        substance over form, with due regard to the spirit and
        gamesmanship fundamental to disc sports as set forth in
        section 102 of Article I herein. <ul>
            <li>103.01 <u>Comments</u>: To facilitate
                understanding and comprehension of the rules of
                disc play, a comment discussing the event appears
                at the beginning of the set of rules pertaining
                to that event. The comment shall not be
                considered a rule; however, it may be used as an
                aid in interpretation of the actual rules.</li>
            <li>103.02 <u>Rule Changes</u>: Suggestions for rule
                changes or additions concerning specific events
                are to be made to the appropriate WFDF event
                committees. Proposals concerning general rule
                considerations may be made directly to the WFDF
                Rules Committee (RUC).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All event committees shall submit their proposed rule
        documents for the coming season by November 1. The RUC
        shall then review the proposed rules and, through
        communication with the event committees, assemble the
        rule book for the coming season. The book shall be
        submitted to the Board for ratification by Jan. 1. After
        ratification, the rules shall be effective commencing
        April 1.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a name="104"></a><b>104 Tournaments</b>: Players shall
        compete in one or more of the disc events at tournaments
        organized or sanctioned by WFDF or organized and
        sanctioned by a nation which is a member of WFDF. <ul>
            <li>104.01 <u>Entry</u>: To qualify for entry in a
                tournament, a player shall pay the entry fee set
                by the tournament director and by WFDF.</li>
            <li>104.02 <u>Tournament Director</u>: The tournament
                shall be under the management and control of a
                tournament director who shall oversee the entire
                tournament, appoint officials and delegate duties
                and responsibilities to said officials and other
                tournament personnel, interpret the rules of play
                when necessary, settle disputes as they arise,
                perform any other acts and duties required by the
                WFDF rules, and otherwise insure that the
                tournament is conducted in an efficient,
                professional, consistent and fair manner.</li>
            <li><a name="104.03"></a>104.03 <u>Determining Order
                of Play</u>: Whenever it is necessary to
                determine which player or team shall commence
                play or have the right to choose which field to
                defend, or whenever an arbitrary method of
                resolving a deadlock is required, the disc
                flipping method shall be used. This method shall
                be performed as follows: The two principals or
                their representatives shall meet, each with a
                disc, and shall release their respective discs,
                with a flipping motion, into the air. The
                principal or representative shall choose the
                &quot;same&quot; or &quot;different&quot;
                position while the discs are in the air and the
                other principal or representative shall receive
                the choice not taken. The principals or
                representatives shall then permit the discs to
                come to rest without impeding the discs'
                movements. If both discs come to rest in a right
                side up or upside down position, the principal or
                representative with the &quot;same&quot; position
                choice wins the flip. If one disc is right side
                up and the other is upside down, the principal or
                representative with the &quot;different&quot;
                position choice wins the flip.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a name="105"></a><b>105 Classification of Players:</b>
        To promote fair competition, players shall be classified
        based upon age and sex and shall compete against other
        players of a like classification, or, at their
        discretion, in the open field of players. The following
        classifications shall be used:<ul>
            <li>105.01 <u>Open Division</u>: All players who do
                not qualify for any other division or choose not
                to compete in any other division.</li>
            <li>105.02 <u>Women's Division</u>: Available only to
                female players. The women's division may be

                than five persons at a tournament qualify for
                that division. If a division is suspended, the
                players who would have qualified for that
                division shall compete in another division in
                which they qualify, or the open division.</li>
            <li>105.10 <u>Choice of Divisions</u>: If a player
                qualifies for more than one division, he or she

    <li><a name="108"></a><b>108 Test Methods For Discs: </b>Metric
        measurements shall be employed in characterizing the
        physical properties of flying discs. All linear
        measurements shall be rounded to the nearest millimeter;
        measurements ending in 0.5 mm shall be rounded up. Weight
        measurements will be rounded to the nearest decigram;
        measurements ending in 0.5 dg shall be rounded up. The
        methods to be employed in testing shall be:<ul>
            <li>A. Establish The Outside Disc Diameter - This
                attribute will be recorded using a pair of
                calipers with a 40 cm measuring capacity.
                Measurements will be taken from two transects at
                right angles to one another across the long axis
                of the disc. By taking two measurements, any
                potential effects due to warpage are factored
                out. These measurements will then be averaged.</li>
            <li>B. Establish The Rim Depth - The disc shall be
                laid on its top with the rim up. If the disc is
                warped the measurements shall be taken where the
                measurement will be the smallest after the disc
                has been laid flat to remove the effect of
                warpage as much a possible. A straight edge shall
                be laid across from rim to rim and measurements
                taken at the point where the rim meets the flight
                plate to the straight edge. This measurement
                shall be established is multiplied by the
                allowable minimum percentage of rim depth. The
                measured depth must be greater than or equal to
                the calculated minimum allowable.</li>
            <li>C. Establish The Disc Weight - Multiply the
                previously established outside rim diameter by
                the maximum allowed weight per cm of diameter.
                The measured weight must be less than or equal to
                the calculated maximum allowable.</li>
            <li>D. Establish Rim Configuration - The rim of the
                disc shall be held perpendicular to a contour
                gauge having 13 probes per cm (such as the Valued
                ST142). The rim of the disc shall then be pressed
                into the gauge to a depth of 5 mm. The resulting
                movement of probes is to be evaluated with the
                movement of each probe being measured to the
                nearest 0.25 mm. The measurements for all
                affected probes are then totaled to produce the
                rim configuration rating. The ratings of three
                examples shall be determined with the median
                score used.</li>
            <li>E. Establish Leading Edge Radius - This attribute
                will be evaluated through the use of a 1/16 in
                (1.6 mm) radius gauge. To pass this test, the
                leading edge of the disc must not contact the
                gauge (see Fig. 1.1)<img src="image1_1.gif"
                align="middle" vspace="10" width="303"
                height="72">Fig 1.1</li>
            <li>F. Establish Disc Flexibility - The disc is to be
                held on its edge, in a vertical
                position,perpendicular to a weight scale with a
                measure plate placed on its inner rim (see Figure
                1.2[A]). The scale shall have a precision of at
                least ± 2oz (56.7g) The height of the measure
                plate shall be 1/2 the outside disc diameter. The
                upper rim of the disc shall then be gradually
                pressed down within a period of 5 seconds. The
                flexibility rating is the maximum pressing force
                measured prior to when the upper rim touches the
                measure plate (see Figure 1.2[B]). The
                temperature of the disc is to be no higher than
                25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit) when
                the test is made. For approval of a specific
                model, the ratings of three examples shall be
                determined with the median score being used. <img

        tournament director may disqualify a player from any
        event or from the entire tournament whenever that player
        exhibits violent, obscene, abusive, disruptive or illegal
        behavior; is continuously annoying to other players,
        cheats or otherwise attempts to create an unfair
        advantage for himself or disadvantage for others through
        a circumvention of the rules, or otherwise causes
        substantial hardship, inconvenience, or annoyance to
        spectators, officials, or other players. This rule shall
        not supercede, alter or in any way affect the rules of

            <li>110.01 Whenever a disc player chooses to
                challenge a decision made by a tournament
                director or official or a result entered at a
                tournament, he or she shall file a written
                protest to WFDF, or an official designated by
                WFDF to handle protests, within 10 days of the
                occurrence giving rise to the dispute. The
                protest shall be reviewed and either upheld,
                dismissed or held in abeyance pending
                investigation, at the discretion of WFDF or its
                designated official. An investigation may include
                interviewing any or all individuals with personal
                knowledge of the circumstances involved in the
                dispute, or conducting a hearing, if deemed

                served upon the tournament director in question
                and the protesting player. All decisions are
                final and not appealable.</li>

                    <li>B. improperly aided or made calls or

                        tournament director or other official
                        when the call or decision resulted in an
                        unfair advantage or disadvantage, being
                        created when the advantage or
                        disadvantage created was not the

                        decision;</li>
                    <li>C. any act committed by a player.

                or she would have been in were it not for the
                circumstances leading to the protest.</li>
            <li>110.05 <u>Sanction</u>: If a protest is upheld,

                retroactive to the tournament in question;

                recognition of a record set or tied at a
