Field hockey is the oldest known ball-and-stick game and is believed
to date from the earliest civilizations, although there is no conclusive
evidence of exactly how and where the game began. The Arabs, Greeks, Persians,
and Romans each had their own versions of hockey and traces of a stick
game played by the Aztec Indians of South America have also been found.
Hockey can also be identified with other early games, such as hurling and
shinty and, during the Middle Ages, a French stick game called hoquet was
played, and the English word may have derived from this. The sport is referred
to as field&nbsp;<IMG SRC="scene1.jpg" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 HEIGHT=223 WIDTH=150 ALIGN=RIGHT>hockey
to distinguish it from the sport of ice hockey.

'Modern hockey' developed in the British Isles but it was not until
the first half of the 19th century that field hockey became firmly established.
The first club was Blackheath, headquartered in southeast London prior
to 1861. The club played on a large piece of open ground with crudely designed
sticks and a 'ball' that was a solid cube of black rubber. At this time
there were few offensive or defensive tactics involved in the game and,
although Blackheath was the first club it was Teddington, another London
club, which modernized and refined the game by introducing several major
variations into hockey, such as: including the ban of using hands or lifting
sticks above the shoulder. They also began to use a sphere as the ball (instead
of the rubber cube) and, most importantly, they instituted the striking
circle which was incorporated into the rules of the newly founded Hockey
Association in London in 1886.&nbsp;

After modern field hockey had developed in the British Isles in the
late 19th century, it spread throughout the British Empire, largely due
to the British army and this is one reason why India, Pakistan and Australia
are so formidable (all were British colonies). Today, field hockey is played
all over the world by a <A HREF="international.html">variety of countries</A> and
field hockey is currently recognized as the second largest team sport in
the world, just behind soccer.
