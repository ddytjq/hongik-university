              Tenn. - (June 27, 2002) - The guard is changing slightly at Crazy 
              
              8's. Last year's elite field for the Indian Path Medical Center 
              &amp; SunTrust 
              Bank Crazy 8's 8K Run was loaded with former champs and other superstars 
              
              making serious noise on the road race circuit. The results proved 
              it as 4 of 
              the top 5, and 7 of the top 15 times were run in 2001 through the 
              late night 
              streets of Kingsport on the candle-lit, figure-8 course. Alene Emere 
              of 
              Ethiopia and Enock Mitei of Kenya finished just a tick of the clock 
              slow of 
              Peter Githuka's world record, set here in 1996. They also just missed 
              
              pocketing the Regional Eye Center $10,008 Bonus. Emere and Mitei 
              were the 
              fastest, but Kenyans Shadrack Kosgei and David Makori were only 
              a few blinks 
              behind, finishing 3rd and 4th while carving their marks on the Crazy 
              8's 
              all-time list in the 4th and 5th slots.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Even 
              though none of the above athletes, including Githuka, will return 
              to run 
              this year on July 13, race director Hank Brown is still enthusiastic 
              about 
              who is coming.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;We 
              tried to get those guys back, but unfortunately they were unable 
              to 
              return,&quot; says Brown. &quot;But we're getting some runners who 
              are pretty hot right 
              now. Remember when Peter Githuka came in 1996, not many people had 
              heard of 
              him.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Elly 
              Rono of Kenya is one of those hot runners. He has already broken 
              the 
              tape at two marathons this year - the Mercedes Marathon and Grandma's 
              
              Marathon. His Grandma's victory occurred just last weekend in a 
              very 
              impressive time of 2:10:57, which just happens to be his personal 
              best. In 
              addition to Mercedes and Grandma's, his marathon resume sparkles 
              with 
              victories at Flying Pig (Cincinnati), Columbus, Cal International, 
              Ocean 
              State and Pittsburgh. Rono's local sponsor will be Dr. Jon Mather.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Yeah, 
              we're pretty jazzed about Grandma's,&quot; said his agent Missy 
              Foy, 
              herself a national class distance runner. &quot;It was really a 
              breakthrough race 
              for him. He'll take a week off now and rest for Crazy 8's. He'll 
              be ready to 
              run a fast race.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Fellow 
              countryman Patrick Nthiwa is also ready to run fast at Crazy 8's. 
              He 
              was in Kingsport last year and finished a very impressive 10th in 
              a little 
              over 23 minutes. He is hoping to do better this year. He's run 13:30 
              for a 5K 
              and 28:10 for a 10K. Nthiwa in 10th and previous commitment John 
              Itati in 6th 
              are the lone returnees from last year's top 10. Bechtel Engineering 
              will 
              sponsor Nthiwa while in Kingsport.</font></p>

              Sylvia Mosqueda from Los Angeles will be making her first appearance 
              
              at Crazy 8's. She is a fierce competitor who fears no one and is 
              not afraid 
              to push the pace. She has run as fast as 15:30 for a 5K and 31:54 
              for a 10K. 
              Her 8K best is 25:35, which just happens to be faster than the Crazy 
              8's 
              course record (25:40, Margaret Okayo, 1999). As far back as 1988, 
              she won the 
              NCAA 10,000m. She recently finished 3rd at the USA 5K 
              Championship/Freihofer's Run for Women. Fleming's Tune-up will be 
              Mosqueda's

              been after Sylvia to come to Crazy 8's for years,&quot; said Brown. 
              &quot;We 
              finally worked it out this year. I have a lot of respect for Sylvia 
              and the 
              way she races. She doesn't back down to anybody. If she's in the 
              race at the 
              end, look out.&quot;</font></p>

              another young Kenyan prot&eacute;g&eacute; on her way up the distance 
              running ladder. 
              Kiplagat made a name for herself on several Kenyan junior teams. 
              She finished 
              4th in 1996 and 1997 in the Junior World Cross Country Championships 
              at the 
              4K distance. She finished 2nd in 1996 and 3rd in 1998 at the Junior 
              World 
              Track &amp; Field Championships at 3000m.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In 
              1999 and 2000 she took time off to concentrate on school and didn't 
              race 
              much. She's back now and running some smart times, like 8:50 for 
              3000 meters 
              and 32:14 for 10K. Martin Dentistry will be her local sponsor.</font></p>

              director Tandy Fleming, heir apparent to Brown in 2003. &quot;From 
              looking at

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 
              2002 Teva U.S. Mountain Running Team will travel to Innsbruck, Austria 
              to 
              compete in the 18th WMRA World Mountain Running Trophy in September. 
              Although 
              the U.S. has competed at the worlds since 1987 (senior men) and 
              1995 (senior 
              women), this is the first year the U.S. team will include juniors. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 
              junior men's course at the World Trophy will be 9.2 km with 1,044 
              meters 
              of vertical gain, the same course as the senior women. The junior 
              women will 
              run 3.3 km and climb 334 meters. Both junior events will be staged 
              on 
              Saturday, September 14.</font></p>

              under the age of 20 in the year of competition are eligible to

              were selected based on road, trail, track and cross country results 
              
              and since this year's courses are uphill-only (in odd-numbered years 
              courses 
              are uphill/downhill), an additional consideration was the proven 
              ability to 
              run well uphill. Each athlete was required to submit a letter of 
              
              recommendation from his or her coach and each athlete must be a 
              current

              34:30 for 
              10km. According to coach Carl Sniffen, &quot;Trevor will be working 
              on strength 
              and endurance this summer including a week of running in Grand Lake, 
              Colorado 
              in June, a week at Steens Mountain Running Camp in July, and four 
              days on the 
              Oregon coast in August.&quot; An enthusiastic Hanlin says, &quot;I 
              want to help my team
