Charged black holes are rather boring without their spacetime diagrams.
That's why this section seems brief.  All the fun stuff happens when
time-like suddenly becomes space-like and then flips back again, and I
chose to lump that stuff all together in <a href="inside.html">Inside
'em</a>.
<a name="photon"><h1>The Photon Sphere</h1>
You know, this photon sphere is pretty much like the photon sphere of a
<a href="static.html">static black hole</a>.  Briefly, the photon sphere
has a radius of 3/2 R<sub>s</sub>.  It is where light rays can hold
unstable orbits around the black hole.  It is also the last possible
orbital radius, since orbiting at any smaller radius would involved going
faster than light.  Hypothetically speaking, if you levelled your eye
there, you would see the back of your head.  Ah, the photon sphere summed
up in four sentences!
<a name="horizons"><h1>Event horizons</h1>
Whoa....horizon<i>s</i>---plural??  And just how does this happen
Schwarzschild's geometry when before it predicted only one horizon?
Simple: when considering a black hole with charge, Schwarzschild's
solution for the geometry of spacetime is no longer valid.  We need
something else!  We need...the Reissner-Nordstr&#248m solution!  The two
scientists with that namesake solution discovered that, if a small charge
is added to a black hole, the event horizon shrinks <i>and a second, inner
horizon forms just above the singularity!</i>  I've heard the inner
horizon called the Cauchy horizon, and I've also heard that electrons
tend to "hover" around this horizon; but I can't actually recall where I
heard these things---I'm afraid you're going to just have to forget I
said 'em!  What does this mean? Well, the event horizon is where,
according to a distant observer, time seems to stop.  A charged black hole
just has two radii where time seems to stop.
<p>
The more charge the black hole acquires, the smaller the outer event
horizon and the larger the inner event horizon gets.  If the black hole
acquires a charge whose magnitude is as great as its mass (an insanely
large number in the order of magnitude of 10<sup>30</sup> coulombs), the
outer and inner event horizons merge. Should the black
hole acquire a charge with a magnitude greater than its own mass, both
horizons vanish and leave a naked (eek!) singularity.  This is great.
This is neat.  We can get rid of both event horizons!  That means we can
weave and bob around the charged black hole's singularity all we please
without worry about needing to go faster than the speed of light.
<a name="catch"><h1>Practicality intrudes with a catch</h1>
There's always a catch, though (you knew this was coming).  The two event
horizons only disappear when the magnitude of the charge of the black hole
is greater than its mass.  Black holes come in 3 solar masses or more. One
solar mass is roughly 1.989 x 10<sup>30</sup> kilograms.  That's huge!!
You would be truly hard-pressed to amass a charge of that magnitude.
<p>
Let's just say, for hypothetical puposes, that you managed to charge up a
black hole enough to disperse the two horizons.  Great.  Now you have to
carefully monitor everything that goes into and comes out of it and must
keep a great store of charge on hand.  Something with that much charge
would tend to rip apart the atoms around it, pulling the oppositely
charged parts into itself.  It's almost as if the black hole is actively
trying to neutralize its charge like a person would try to warm up by
drinking a cup of hot liquid (mmm, hot tea!).  People give electrons
personalities and desires, so I see nothing wrong with doing the same for
charged black holes.
<p>
<a name="standard"><h1>Standard Singularity</h1>
The singularity of a charged black hole is the same as that of a <a
href="static.html">static black hole</a> with the exception that it is
possible for the singularity to exist without any protective horizons.
Physicists just don't like this, Roger Penrose included; of such events he
said, "thou shalt not have naked singularities!"<a
href="breferences.html#sup5"><sup>5</sup></a>  I'm inclined to agree for
practical reasons, but I still think it is possible to have such an
unveiled singularity.  The trouble just comes in when you try to describe
such a...place?  Infinitly curved space with quantum mechanics kicking
in...messy, isn't it?
<p>
Did I say there was only one difference between the singularity of a
static black hole and that of a charged one?  How forgetful of me!  Truly,
there is one other important difference: you can avoid the singularity of
a charged black hole, whereas you must eventually encounter that of a
static black hole.  Encountering a singularity (thus assuming that you
surived the <a href="inside.html#tidal">tidal forces</a> from the trip
there!) is not something you want to do, I can assume.  Why is this so
neat?  In a static black hole, once inside the event horizon, that's
it---end of your life.  However, should you survive the trip between the
outer event horizon and the inner one of a charged black hole, you could
in theory turn around and leave the black hole back and return to 
your own universe, or you could go into another universe...but...<a
