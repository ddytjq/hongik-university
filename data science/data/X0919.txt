                Well, after a grueling accounting exam this morning, and a short 
                flight on a loud propeller airplane to Newark from D.C. with Mr. 
                Lockhart and my teammate Nicole Lee, it was finally time to go 
                to Dublin. The whole U.S. team was just chatting about how things 
                were going before boarding the six-hour flight. It's incredible! 
                I hear and read of so many great accomplishments by fellow collegians 
                and Americans like Meb Keflezighi, Jorge Torres, and Dathan Ritzenhein, 
                and I am right there, on the same team, although not in the same 
                exact race. It is incredible to see how great runners like them 
                act outside of running. </font></p>
                
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Tim 
                Moore, Yong Sung Leal, Bobby Lockhart, and I grabbed something 
                to eat before the long flight to Dublin. I am already enjoying 
                the trip. We were just sitting there eating, joking around about 
                races we have done in the past, and it was just great. Everyone 
                on the U.S. team seems really nice. I really look forward to relaxing 
                with them this week, and of course racing with them on Sunday.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I 
                left Georgetown today with all my teammates wishing Nicole and 
                me good luck for the biggest race of our lives thus far. My roommate 
                Chris Esselborn, who was 7th at Junior Nationals just missing 
                Worlds by one place, was in such high spirits, knowing I was going 
                to represent the U.S. in Ireland, although he was obviously disappointed 
                about not making it. The guy has worked so hard to improve as 
                much as he has since high school. Charlie Millioen, another close 
                teammate of mine, also reminded me of the sense of fulfillment 
                in representing not only the U.S., but also Georgetown University. 
                I think they both are really going to surprise people very soon.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We 
                are now about half an hour into our flight to Dublin, Ireland. 
                I just heard that we are going to watch &quot;Serendipity&quot; 
                during the flight. Ahh man, another chick flick!! Nicole is sitting 
                beside me content that she can see &quot;Serendipity&quot; for 
                the second time. Oh well. I have to try and sleep anyway, because 
                I need to stay awake when we arrive to Dublin to adjust to the 
                time change. I can't wait to get out of this cramped plane and 
                get to Dublin! </font> </p>

                It took six hours of sitting in the full plane, but we were finally 
                hovering over Dublin. I looked over the green rolling hills, as 
                if it was a country full of golf courses. It took a little less 
                than two hours to get all of our baggage situated and get everyone 
                on a bus. We were reminded that today would be very tiring, because 
                we are supposed to stay up all day to get accustomed to the time 
                change. They could not have been more correct. The whole day I 
                did not dare sit or lay down on my bed, if I had, I would have 
                fallen into a deep sleep. Since I have never been to Europe, I 
                found it extremely weird looking at all the miniature &quot;golf 
                carts&quot; driving on the freeway on the left side of the road.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 
                City West Hotel Golf Resort is gorgeous. It's an old-fashioned 
                three-story hotel resort. The Irish Snooker Championships were 
                also being played in the City West Hotel. Maybe I should have 
                taken on Snooker instead of running. Shortly after my arrival 
                into the hotel, Zach Sabatino, my roommate for the trip, and I 
                went on a 40 minute run down the roads around the hotel. The run 
                did not feel too great, because of not sleeping for the past 24 
                hours. In addition, this dog came out of nowhere and started running 
                with us for over half the run. The little mutt would be dodging 
                cars just to keep up with us. After the run, we just had to find 
                something to do without falling asleep until after dinner. I saw 
                &quot;Without Limits&quot; for the first time, compliments of 
                Billy Nelson. There were some really good parts, but I think overall 
                &quot;Prefontaine&quot; was a better movie. Jim Nichols, our team 
                leader talked with us about our plans for the rest of the week, 
                and also what to expect at the race. I am truly excited about 
                the big race. I hear that it is quite similar to what NCAA Nationals 
                was like this year. That is good, because I learned from many 
                mistakes in Furman. Worlds would let me get some revenge from 
                similar competition even before the next NCAA Championships.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After 
                just getting back from dinner, I am excited to finally get some 
                real sleep since Monday night. Today was just supposed to be more 
                of a relaxing day after the jet lag. We are planning to go out 
                to the city tomorrow to just hang out and walk around. </font></p>

                Last night was one of those nights where I was so tired that it 
                seemed like I had blinked my eyes and it was morning. It was more 
                like 11 hours, and I still wanted to stay in bed for another couple 
                of hours. At around 8:30, the Junior Team met up and jogged to 
                a park so some of the guys could to do some kind of workout. I 
                only did about 25 minutes this morning, because I wanted to do 
                a workout later that afternoon. Soon after breakfast, the junior 
                men and women, and some others from the senior team went to downtown 
                Dublin. It was pretty funny walking down the street with people 
                staring at us because we have Team USA jackets on. One guy passed 
                us holding out a peace sign and screaming out &quot;What's up 
                dude!&quot; I guess that's the impression they get of how people 
                in the U.S. are. Haha. Bobby Lockhart, Tim Moore, and I ended 
                up going off on our own just checking out shops. We ate at an 
                Italian restaurant, which was not filling at all. That's one thing 
                I really noticed in Ireland - the food portions are so much smaller, 
                but the meals cost about the same price in U.S. dollars. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After 
                coming back from downtown Dublin, I did a little workout at this 
                nice little park. The workout wasn't much, just something to get 
                my legs moving a little. I am beginning to think about the race 
                a lot more, especially after the workout. In high school, I was 
                one of those guys that got so nervous before races that I did 
                not want to talk to anyone except my coach. I would get so nervous 
                that during my sophomore and junior years, I would throw up before 
                every race. I do still get really nervous before races in college, 
                but I thankfully haven't thrown up before a race since high school. 
                I really do not know what exactly to expect at the race this weekend. 
                I kind of like it that way, because I don't know what times anyone 
                has really run in any other country. I know I need to keep in 
                contact, but make sure I keep on moving up throughout the race. 
                I don't want to get caught up front and then end up falling back. 
                </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After 
                dinner, we (Junior Men) went outside, because Yong Sung claimed 
                that he could shotgun a can of coke really well. The first try 
                was a disaster, because the coke sprayed all over his whole body. 
                To top it off, he had to walk back inside the main lobby with 
                coke all over him. He got it down the second try though in the 
                room. Yong Sung seems like a really friendly guy. He is just one 
                of those guys that goes into a room and will introduce himself 
                to anyone. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366">Friday,

                I woke up at around 8:15 today, and went on a shakeout run for 
                about 20 minutes. After breakfast, I had to do some calculus work. 
                The Spainish team came to our room asking to trade some stuff. 
                I was all up for trading t-shirts, but they wanted to trade our 
                warm-ups, and I did not agree to that. After the race, I do plan 
                on trading some things with the other countries though. We headed 
                to the course today at around 3:00 p.m. Instead of all the countries 
                going to the course all at one time, they split them by hotels. 
                All the countries staying at our hotel left in like five buses. 
                It was pretty nice, because the buses got escorted by the &quot;garda&quot; 
                through the city. The course is actually a horse racetrack. We 
                start of in chutes separated by metal pipes, and instead of there 
                being a starting gun, they lower a rope to begin the race. Our 
                race is four loops and some change to the finish. The race would 
                begin in very uneven, long grass, and then veer off to a rolling 
                course. Overall, if the rain stays away for the next couple of 
                days, it should be a quicker course than Vancouver. I did three 
                loops on the course and some drills and strides to loosen up a 
                bit. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After 
                dinner at the hotel, the junior and senior men decided to meet 
                up so that we could ask some questions about the race. I asked 
                if it was similar to NCAA Nationals, where many runners who held 
                back the first mile and gradually moved up ended up running really 
                well. Dathan, Jorge, and some others in the senior race that have 
                run at NCAAs explained to us that pretty much for every runner 
                that finished up top at NCAAs, there would be three or four people 
                at World's. They were saying that it would be best to get up there 
                quickly, or else it would be very tough to catch up near the end. 
                Abdi Abdirahman was said the same thing, that we do not want to 
                have any regrets about going out a little easier and not having 
                a chance to compete against the best, which we all obviously came 
                here for. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I 
                do believe that I have to get up near the front at the beginning, 
                but also I need to keep forward momentum. I do not want to get 
                in the position of going out crazy, and moving backwards at the 
                end. I just need to get in a good position, and try to move up 
                through the race. Besides, I have to remember I am not alone in 
                this predicament. I just have to go out there and keep my head 
                up, and depend on what I have done to get here. The work is done.

                I woke up a little early this morning (7:15), and went on a short 
                30-minute jog with Zach, then did some drills and strides. After 
                breakfast, we all went to the course to watch the junior women's 
                6k, senior men's 4k, and senior women's 8k. All the races were 
                very impressive. The USA junior girls pretty much finished in 
                a tight pack, except for Erika Odlaug who tore it up to finish 
                17th. Nicole was the team's fourth finisher finishing 40th in 
                the world. She ran a great race, and I'm happy for her. The guys' 
                race was also very exciting. A 19-year-old Ethiopian ended up 
                running away with the victory. Torres was the top U.S. finisher 
                in 11th place. He seemed to run a perfect race, because he was 
                in about the 20s at the beginning, then the mid-to-high teens 
                after one lap, and had a strong finish. He and Ritz both are very 
                consistent competitors. Drossin really gave Paula Radcliffe a 
                run for her money, but Paula successfully defended her title in 
                the women's 8k. Overall as a team, the U.S. is doing really well 
                thus far. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">While 
                we were watching the race, some kids from Ireland asked all of 
                us for our autographs. Shortly after, a group of girls came up 
                to Zach and me, asking us to sign their shirts. It's really funny 
                how we attracted a lot of attention just because we are from the 
                United States. Some people seemed to be looking at us in a bad 
                way, and others in a good way. Oh well, it does not hurt any of 
                us. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When 
                we arrived back from the hotel, I just wanted to relax for the 
                rest of the day. Going to the course and watching people race, 
                really got me nervous/excited for the race. It's funny how almost 
                every possibility of how the race could end up, will go through 
                a runner's mind before the race even begins. We (junior men) met 
                up tonight after dinner with Jim Nichols (our team leader) to 
                talk about the race tomorrow. During Cross with Georgetown, we 
                would always meet up the night before to go over our thoughts 
                about the race the next day. It pretty much came down to us realizing 
                that every race is special. As a freshman with the Hoyas, I would 
                only be racing with my senior teammates only a few times. I made 
                sure to remind the guys that we should cherish the moments in 
                Ireland, and to remember everything we worked for when we are 
                hurting during the race. After being in Ireland for about four 
                days, I think the U.S. is ready to do some damage at the race 
                tomorrow. The next time I am typing on this laptop should be a 
                good message!</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#003366">Sunday, 
                March 24, 2002<b> Race Day</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
                We arrived at the course about two hours before the race was scheduled 
                to begin. Some of us did the warm-up together, others wanted to 
                do it on their own. Some people get annoyed when people want to 
                do their own thing. I figure that if they think warming up alone 
                is what will make them race better, then game on. We had to arrive 
                at a tent to sign up and get our computer chips attached on our 
                ankles 30 minutes before the race. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 
                race went out quickly, as expected. About half the course - at 
                the beginning of the race and the finish - was in uneven, tall 
                grass. I started behind Billy Nelson and Tim Moore, because, as 
                anyone knows if they have seen Nelson race, he likes to get in 
                front right away. About 600 meters into the race, I thought I 
                was in good position (middle of the pack). As I veered of to the 
                side, I saw the leader already about 80 meters ahead of me! After 
                I saw that, I gradually got to the side and moved up. I caught 
                up to Moore and Lockhart at about 3k. The fans there were great. 
                Even the Irish fans, mostly the officials on the course, were 
                cheering for the U.S. Lockhart and I then pushed each other through 
                6k. It was great, both he and I kept on trying to break each other, 
                but each of us would get right back beside the other. With 2k 
                left, Lockhart and I were in about the mid 30s. I then tried pushing 
                it a little and ended up passing a few guys near the finish. I 
                ended up finishing up in 30th, with three of my teammates finishing 
                33-39-41 (Nelson, Lockhart, Leal). I can't complain about my performance. 
                I thought I executed the race the way I should have, but I would 
                always have wanted to finish a little better. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 
                part I really enjoyed was just racing and finishing with the rest 
                of the USA guys. Tim Moore was not too pleased with his finish 
                at Worlds. He won't make any excuses, but he had a cold for a 
                couple of weeks, and little things like that could screw around 
                with how you race. Especially with how hard all of us went at 
                the beginning. He's a classy athlete. After the race, all the 
                runners were directed to a large room where all our belongings 
                were placed. Yong Sung went up to the Japanese team and said something 
                in Japanese that he had memorized from a Japanese cartoon. Haha. 
                They found that pretty funny. Yong Sung and this other guy ended 
                up trading jackets. We then watched them Men's 12k race after 
                our cool down. Abdi and Meb ran pretty solid finishing in the 
                low teens. The winner was the same 19-year-old from Ethiopia that 
                won the 4k. It was so incredible watching that guy win both races. 
                Ritz ran an incredible race, finishing in 24th. Once you think 
                he has surprised you enough, he goes out and does something even 
                more astonishing. He really gives hope to the future of USA distance 
                running. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After 
                the race, we relaxed at the hotel for about an hour, then had 
                a little USA ceremony. I talked to Coach Henner about my race. 
                He told me it is good to race at a high level, in a different 
                country, with totally new surroundings from what you are used 
                to, and still be able to compete well. He has really helped make 
                my transition to Georgetown very smooth. I am very grateful to 
                have the opportunity to be coached by him through my college career. 
                </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">At 
                around 7:00 p.m., we headed to the Worlds Banquet. None of the 
                guys that raced had really eaten anything the whole day. We were 
                all sitting there for about an hour while they would serve a small 
                salad, then a little appetizer, small cup of soup, and then finally 
                a steak! While we were sitting down, a lot of people just went 
                around and traded stuff. The Japanese team wanted our stuff more 
                than anything. One girl from Japan was happy to trade her whole 
                warm-up suit for a USA spike bag with one of the junior women. 
                In addition, the Japanese guy that traded jackets with Yong Sung 
                after the race just went up to him and gave his athletic bag with 
                new shoes in them as a gift. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After 
                the dinner, they had a party for all the runners. It was great 
                just watching all the stars loosen up. Especially watching the 
                U.S. athletes dance to Irish music. I really hope no one got that 
                on tape, because we had no idea what we were doing. That night, 
                I could not stop analyzing the race. If anything, that race got 
                me really excited for other races to come. I wish NCAAs were next 
                week or something. We got back to the hotel at around 12:30 a.m., 
                and most of the junior men and women just chilled together. I 
                liked getting to know the rest of the guys. Nelson is a really 
                nice guy, and seems like Pre's number one fan. Tim Moore is the 
                quiet one of the group. Yong Sung would be the one to do or say 
                anything out of nowhere. Zack Sabatino was nicknamed &quot;The 
                Backstreet Boy&quot; by the rest of the team. I'm not sure he 
                liked that nickname too much. Lockhart is the laid back one of 
                the group. They started calling me &quot;snack boy&quot; by the 
                end of the trip. I always happened to have ritz crackers, gummy 
                bears, or a powerbar in my hand when they saw me, and they would 
                see me get something out of the vending machine before going somewhere. 
                What can I say, I like to chew on things. Bobby a.k.a (Booby Lockhart) 
                wanted to take a picture with me beside the vending machine. I 
                didn't find that too amusing. After almost a week of hanging out 
                with these guys, it seemed like I had known them forever. </font></p>

                Well, I slept for about 90 minutes last night, because we had 
                to wake up at around 6:00 a.m. for the flight. We took a connection 
                flight to Shannon, Ireland, which took about 30 minutes. Then 
                we had the seven-hour flight to Newark. Ritz originally had the 
                window seat, while I had the aisle. I offered to switch if he 
                wanted, just to be nice. Well, that was a big mistake. I ended 
                up sitting beside two old people, and in front of a little French 
                kid who was so excited to go to Disney World in Orlando that he 
                kept on singing the Mickey Mouse song in French. At least I think 
                he was, because I would hear him say Mickey Mouse while he was 
                singing. Not only was he singing, but he also kept on kicking 
                my damn chair the whole time while I tried to sleep. I also had 
                to study for two major tests on Wednesday. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When 
                we arrived to Newark, it was time to head to our destination flights, 
                and say goodbye to the U.S. team. All the junior guys swapped 
                e-mails to keep in touch. I definitely plan on keeping in touch 
                with all of them. All of the guys really have bright running futures 
                ahead of them. By just talking to them, you know that they really 
                take their running seriously. Just like that, the trip was over. 
                I cannot emphasize how good of a time I had in Ireland. Being 
                able to race and watch older world-class athletes, running-wise 
                and just socially, is a great experience. </font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">If 
                I could give any advice to someone going to Worlds, I would say 
                to remember to do your own thing to prepare for the race. You 
                must remember what got you there, and not get scared or intimidated 
                by hearing what others have done to get to Worlds. Al Lawrence, 
                who's a former Australian Olympian, my high school coach, and 
                like a second father to me, always says that it is a great advantage 
                to be able to analyze what others do, but also to depend on what 
                you have been doing. For example, one of the guys on the team 
                likes to do six miles at six-minute pace two days before the race, 
                while someone else barely did anything. They both ended up finishing 
                very close to each other. They did what they always do before 
                a race, and they ran well.</font></p>
              <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 
                number of runners trying out for Junior Worlds seems to be increasing 
                every year. I really hope that continues. Representing the U.S. 
                at Worlds not only benefits the individual, but also will increase 
                the United State's chances at being the best in the World. It 
                used to be a long shot competing with the Africans, but I believe 
                that every year the gap is closing.</font></p>
