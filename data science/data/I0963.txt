INTERVIEW BY: MATCH MAGAZINE(player of the month)<br>
DATE: 12 February 2000<p></center><br>

How Does it feel to have been the best players in the top flight over the course of January?<br>
"It's a great honour for meto be up there with the great players who've won the award in the past. The thing is, now I have won the award for last month I don't just want to stp there. I want to do the same thing next month and win more awards like this one."<p>

Have you been pleased with your own form in the Premiership?<br>
"Yeah, everyone keeps telling me how well I've done but I'm still in my first year at the moment so I've got a lot more to offer. I'm sure that over the coming months I will show people that. When I first got into the team, I didn't play like I have done for the youth team and the reserves for some reason. I was still playing well but for some reason I've found it a lot easier."<p>

So what was the highlight of the month for you, Joe?<br>
"Just my performances generally. Starting from the Newcastle game at the beginning of the month, I feel like I got my second wind and I'm playing now as I did in the youth team. Before last month I was passing the ball a lot more but now I have got my confidence and I can really feel a difference in my game. I'm taking a lot more resposibility when I've got the ball."<p>

And is europe a realistic target for West Ham this season, Joe?<br>
"We're only six points behind Sunderland who are in fifth place and we also have a game in hand so it's something we can still aim for without a doubt. With the players we've got in the squad I think we could go even higher than fifth. Paulo Wanchope has got his confidence back after scoring two goals at Leicester last month and he's looking good at the moment. With him and Paolo Di Canio on form, we are a good side. I think we'll qualify for Europe, I've not got any doubt about that."<!-- text below generated by server.
