                <H3>THE DOE
                MISSION</H3>
                
<HR>
Environmental management and cleanup of the DOE facilities is one of the five primary
missions of the Department of Energy (Fig. 1).  To accomplish this mission,  DOE must
find new and more cost-effective remedies for protecting human health and the
environment, particularly because of the unique composition and large quantities of
hazardous and radioactive wastes that are broadly dispersed in the environment at DOE's
facilities.  DOE's Office of Energy Research (OER) is committed to developing
fundamental scientific knowledge in support of this mission.<P>
 <H3>THE OFFICE OF HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH</H3>

<HR>
To  support the environmental management mission,  OER's Office of Health and
Environmental Research (OHER) will initiate a new program in Natural and Accelerated
Bioremediation Research (NABIR).  The program plan was prepared with assistance and
cooperation from DOE's Office of Environmental Management (EM) and is intended to
complement EM's ongoing technology development programs by improving scientific
understanding of the biogeochemical processes that provide the foundations for
bioremediation. <P>
OHER has a long tradition of sponsoring fundamental research in the life and
environmental sciences.  OHER investigates problems of complexity and scale that are
expected to significantly change the way we think about a field of scientific inquiry.  Such
problems require the long-term commitment of interdisciplinary teams to develop
breakthroughs in scientific understanding and new scientific methods and instruments. 
Examples of such programs include the Human Genome Project, the Atmospheric
Radiation Measurement Program, and the Subsurface Science Program (see Table 1). <P>
NABIR builds on this tradition and is motivated by the belief that bioremediation is an
important part of the solution to DOE's environmental problems. <P>

                <H3>WHY BIOREMEDIATION</H3>
                
<HR>
Bioremediation is defined by the American Academy of Microbiology (AAM) as "the use
of living organisms to reduce or eliminate environmental hazards resulting from
accumulations of toxic chemicals and other hazardous wastes" (Gibson and Sayler, 1992). 
Other options for remediation of soils, sediments, and groundwater include physical and
chemical methods or a combination thereof.  The optimal strategy for any given problem
will depend on the nature and concentration of the contaminant(s), the characteristics of
the hydrogeologic environment, and the extent of contamination.  At the present time,
bioremediation is often the preferred method for remediation of petroleum hydrocarbons
because it is cost effective, and it converts the petroleum hydrocarbons into harmless by-products such as carbon dioxide and water. <P>
Over the past decade, opportunities for applying bioremediation to a much broader set of
contaminants have been identified.  Indigenous and enhanced organisms have been shown
to degrade industrial solvents, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), explosives, and many
different agricultural chemicals.  Pilot, demonstration, and full-scale applications of
bioremediation have been carried out on a limited basis.  Equally importantly,
microorganisms that transform and sequester heavy metals and radionuclides have been
identified and employed, to a limited extent, for <I>in situ</I> bioremediation.  However,
the full benefits of bioremediation have not been realized because processes and organisms
that are effective in controlled laboratory tests are not always equally effective in full-scale
applications.  The failure to perform optimally in the field setting stems from a lack of
predictability due, in part, to inadequacies in the fundamental scientific understanding of
how and why these bioremediation  processes work.<P>
The advantages of <I>in situ</I> bioremediation compared to or in combination with
other remediation technologies include, but are not limited to, the following.<P>
<MENU>
1.              <I>In situ</I> bioremediation can be used to completely degrade and detoxify some
                organic contaminants, thereby permanently removing liability for the contaminants.
                <P>
2.              For deep, widely dispersed plumes of heavy metals and radionuclides,  <i> in
                situ</i> biosequestration and immobilization may be the only viable solution for
                addressing DOE's remediation needs.<P>
3.              For some types of contaminants, physical and chemical methods of remediation may
                not completely remove the contaminants, leaving residual concentrations that are
                above regulatory guidelines.  Bioremediation can be used as a cost-effective
                secondary treatment scheme to decrease the concentration of contaminants to
                acceptable levels.  In other cases, bioremediation can be the primary treatment
                method, and followed by physical or chemical methods for final site closure.<P>
4.              In some cases, natural attenuation (including natural bioremediation) of the
                contaminant plumes may be the only cost effective solution (DOE, 1995).  Natural
                biogeochemical processes that degrade organic contaminants,  convert nitrate to
                nitrogen gas, and sequester heavy metals and radionuclides will play major roles in
                natural attenuation.  These biogeochemical processes must be adequately understood
                before regulatory agencies and the public accept natural attenuation as an alternative
                to more aggressive remediation methods.<P>
5.              For radionuclides and heavy metals broadly dispersed in surface soils,
                phytoremediation (bioremediation using plants) may be the only practical way to
                concentrate and collect the contaminants.  Alternatively, plants that do not
                accumulate radionuclides or heavy metals can be planted to prevent wildlife exposure
                to contaminated sources of food.<P>
6.              In highly heterogeneous geologic environments, physical or chemical methods that
                rely on advective transport of remediation agents to the contaminants may be
                ineffective.  However, in such environments, <I>in situ</I> remediation schemes
                that rely on diffusive transport of remediation agents (e.g., nutrients) to indigenous
                microorganisms for degrading or transforming the contaminants may be more
                effective.<P>
7.              For complex mixtures of contaminants requiring a combination or sequence of
                physical and chemical remediation methods, bioremediation techniques that use
                microbial consortia to  concurrently address all contaminants may be faster and more
                cost-effective.<P>
</MENU>
NABIR will support fundamental research on natural and accelerated bioremediation. 
Both are expected to significantly reduce the cost and improve the effectiveness of
remediation of DOE's contaminated sites.  Although this program emphasizes fundamental
research on <I>in situ</I> bioremediation of soils and groundwater, knowledge
applicable to <I>ex situ</I> waste treatment schemes will be learned and transferred. 
Similarly, this program will focus on microbial bioremediation, compared to
phytoremediation, because the majority of DOE's contaminants are below the rhizosphere. 
However, when appropriate, phytoremediation research will also be sponsored.<P>
<H3>THE NABIR PROGRAM PLAN</H3>

<HR>
The NABIR program plan covers a ten-year period beginning in FY 1996.  The plan
presented here describes the motivation for and structure of the scientific program, the
scientific goals and objectives, and the plans for partnering with EM, regulatory agencies,
and the public to facilitate implementation of the scientific knowledge gained.  A
management structure, implementation plan, schedule, and budget are also provided.<P>
<H3>WHO WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE NABIR PROGRAM?</H3>

<HR>
Participants in the NABIR program will include the national research community, the EM
problem holders, and federal officials with  management and oversight responsibilities. 
The national research community will be engaged in the broadest sense, including
academic, DOE laboratory, other federal agency, and industrial researchers.<P>
Research projects will be carried out by teams of laboratory scientists and engineers,
academic researchers, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and field technicians.  The
scientific teams will be selected through a competitive process, and research projects will
be formally peer-reviewed biannually.  Periodic scientific forums will be held to stimulate
the transfer of ideas and information between researchers and to help guide the direction
of the scientific program.  Programmatic peer reviews will be conducted prior to critical
decision points in the program.  The scientific  direction of the program and its projects
will be adjusted in response to these two types of peer review and broader input from the
scientific community.  In addition, a multi-agency steering committee will be established
to provide coordination between complementary research and technology development
programs.<P>
Integration of the scientific research among the investigators will be key to the success of
the program.  Three field research centers will be established for performing long-term,
interdisciplinary, multi-investigator research and will be the primary integrating vehicles
for the research program.  Large-scale, multi-investigator field experiments will be
conducted to bring together researchers from a variety of scientific and engineering
disciplines.  In addition, the field research centers will be available for investigator-initiated
research by scientists funded from this and other programs.<P>
The field research centers also will be critical for ensuring that the knowledge gained from
NABIR will be used to help solve DOE's environmental management problems.  Locating
the field research centers at DOE facilities will provide ongoing opportunities for a two-way transfer of information between the EM problem holders and the research community. 
Researchers will learn more about site-specific needs for fundamental and applied research. 
Site personnel responsible for the cleanup will keep abreast of the latest scientific
developments and new opportunities for applying bioremediation.<P>
