<h1>Vasser takes fourth win in six IndyCar events</h1>
<img SRC="0526us-1.gif" ALIGN="Left" WIDTH="197" HEIGHT="437">

BROOKLYN, Mich. -- Jimmy Vasser was on the pole, but he began the U.S. 500 in a most ominous way.
<p>
He crashed. 


<p>
Luckily, the wreck -- Vasser appeared to drift into Adrian Fernandez and the bump led to a 12-car pileup -- occurred on the final pace lap and drivers were allowed to change to their backup cars.
<p>
Vasser's backup car worked just fine.<p>
The newest star on the IndyCar circuit continued his amazing season, winning for the fourth time in six races, and took home the biggest prize in his career -- a cool million.
<p>
&quot;It's great! Who needs milk?&quot; Vasser said.
<p> 
	   	   Vasser was dueling with Andre Ribiero when the Brazilian driver
had to duck into the pits for gas with eight laps to go, leaving the track wide open as Vasser cruised to an 11-second victory over another Brazilian,
Mauricio Gugelmin.
<p>
&quot;It's amazing that we could run the spare car like this,&quot;
Vasser said. &quot;It's not as quick as the primary car and we
struggled with it all day. The team won this, that's for sure.&quot;
<p>
Another Brazilian, Roberto Moreno, finished third as Ribiero fell to fourth. Rookie Mark Blundell of Britain was fifth.
<p> 
&quot;This is a great team,&quot; an team owner Chip Ganassi
said. &quot;We went out there in our backup car and won the
race.&quot;
<p>
*Besides the pileup at the start of the race, the race was slowed by 11 other caution flags. Two drivers who contended most of the race, Greg Moore and Alex Zanardi, eventually dropped out after blowing engines. Parker Johnstone, who led as late as lap 207 in the 250-lap event, ran out of gas to blow his opportunity.

<p>
The start of the race was something expected at the rookie-filled Indianapolis 500. Vasser and Fernandez collided in turn four, swerved into the path of the other front row driver, Bryan Herta, and a melee of flying tires and metal ensued, taking out nine more cars.
<p>
Because the race had not officially began, drivers involved were able to repair car damage or change to a backup car. Nine of the drivers used an alternate car.	   
<p>
Vasser and teammate Zanardi, in their Honda-powered cars, were the strongest on the track. Zanardi took the lead on lap 40 and jumped to a 10-second advantage at one point.
<p>	   
The rookie from Italy had led 134 laps when Johnstone took the lead after a yellow flag. Zanardi was moving forward again after a pit stop when his engine blew on lap 175.
<p>	   
&quot;I was sure today was my day,&quot; a downcast Zanardi said, &quot;but
apparently it wasn't.&quot;
<p>
More than 100,000 people attended the race, formed as an alternative to the Indianapolis 500 after speedway owner Tony George guaranteed 25 of the 33 spots in the field to members of his Indy Racing League.
