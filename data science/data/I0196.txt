<H1>Complete Music Hellenic League</H1>
<H2>Founded: 1953</H2>
<P>The Hellenic League was found in 1953 with the bulk of its intial membership
of 16 clubs coming from the Oxfordshire Senior League which remains a feeder
league to the competition. Presumably the choice of name reflected the Olympian
Amateur ideals of the new competition, and mirrored the Grecian names of the
established top amateur leagues such as the Isthmian and Athenian Leagues. In
the first season Princes Risborough Town recorded an unenviable 100% record by
losing all 30 games of the campaign, conceding 160 goals in the process. Of the
original members only Bicester Town have been able to maintain continuous
membership of the league, winning the title twice. Didcot Town, the first ever
champions, are also currently members of the league but had a short spell
outside the league between 1957 and 1963. They have yet to add to their success
in the inaugeral season. The most successful club in the league's history is
Witney Town who accumulated 8 championships up until 1973 when they moved up to
the Southern League. Other member clubs who've moved onto bigger things include
Newport AFC and Forest Green Rovers. Newport AFC, the successors to former
Football League club Newport County and now playing under that title once more,
were members of the Hellenic League in their
first season, 1989-90, winning the title. In 1998 Forest Green Rovers became the
first former member of the Hellenic League to win promotion to the Nationwide
Confernece, the top tier of the Pyramid. They played in the Hellenic League
between 1975 and 1982 and as 1981-82 champions were promoted to the Southern
League (now Beazer Homes League). At various times the Reserve teams of Football
League clubs Luton Town, Oxford United and Swindon Town have played in the
league.</P>

<H2>Area Covered</H2>
<P>The Hellenic League covers Oxfordshire mainly with several clubs in
Gloucestershire, North Wiltshire and North Berkshire. It also includes two clubs
from the Bristol area  as well as one each from Hereford and Ross-on-Wye.</P>
<H2>Structure</H2>
<P>2 divisions, 34 clubs<BR><A HREF="#help">Premier Division</A> (19 clubs)<BR><A
HREF="#hel1">Division One</A> (15 clubs)</P>
<P>The league first expanded to two divisions in 1956 with the top division of
17 clubs designated the Premier Division and a Division One of 10 clubs
(including 3 reserve teams of Premier Division clubs) . In 1971 total membership
reached a high of 46 clubs and Division Two was formed, with a rather unwieldly
split of 17-13-14 between the three divisions. Division Two only lasted for two
seasons and the league reverted to two divisions from 1973. Since then league
membership has fluctuated between a low of 30 clubs in 1975-76 and the current
total of 36. The league first experimented with 3 points for a win in 1974-75,
but reverted back to the traditional 2 points in 1978-79 before finally settling
on 3 points in 1983-84.</P>
