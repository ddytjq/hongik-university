    of the 2000/01 racing season began on August 5 in Sydney with the Group 2 San Domenico
    Stakes for 3yos. Victorious was the promising sprinter Zariz who went on a fortnight later
    to win the Group 2 Up &amp; Coming Stakes. A week later the older horses took centre stage
    in the Group 2 Premiere Stakes with Might &amp; Power expected to make his return to
    racing after being sidelined through injury since November 1998. A minor setback on race
    morning resulted in his scratching which left Mr Innocent to take the race from Celestial
    Choir and Adam. </small></font></p>

    Despite taking on a talented field of sprinters victory was never in doubt as Sunline
    (above &amp; below) cruised home from Group 1 Newmarket winner Miss Pennymoney with Group
    2 winner Honour The Name in third. Meanwhile back in Sydney Al Mansour took out the Group
    2 Warwick Stakes as Might &amp; Power finished near last. After a further unplaced run
    Might &amp; Power was retired and made guest appearances at the WS Cox Plate and Adelaide
    Cup meetings. </small></font></p>

    races of the season were run. The Listed Fulham Park Plate for colts went to Mighty Raja

    <p><font face="Arial" color="#004000"><small>Sydney's spring carnival peaked in early
    October with the Epsom-Metropolitan double. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#004000"><small>October 2 saw three Group 1 races decided
    with Shogun Lodge winning the Epsom before heading to Melbourne for a tilt at the Cox
    Plate, Universal Prince (above)&nbsp; taking out the Spring Champion Stakes before also
    heading to Melbourne but for the 3yo classics while Unworldly cruised home in the Flight
    Stakes in such a dominating fashion that comparisons with Sunline's (above) 3yo form soon
    arose. Further speculation that Unworldly may prove a worthy rival for the Cox Plate were
    sadly ended when the filly broke down irreparably during trackwork on October 10. The
    Hawkes stable suffered a further blow that week when Over (winner of 2000 Doncaster) was
    injured during trackwork in Melbourne and retired. The Metropolitan Hcp proved a return to
    the Group 1 winning list for Coco Cobanna (winner of the Group 1 AJC Oaks the previous
    autumn) who then headed to Melbourne for the Cup carnival. </small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial" color="#004000">In Melbourne on October 7 the new grandstand
    at Flemington was officially opened as many of the spring carnival aspirants displayed
    their wares on the track. The Listed Japan Trophy was won by Brew (above) who was
    beginning to show the ability expected of his breeding (Sir Tristram-Horlicks) while
    Bomber Bill (below) flew down the outside section of the Flemington straight track course
    to win the Group 3 Gilgai Stakes in a tight finish. One of the two features of the days'
    racing, the Group 2 Turnbull Stakes, featured a classy weight for age field with Sunline
    taking on 2000 AJC Derby winner in Fairway plus cup contenders Kaapstad Way, Hill of Grace
    and Diatribe. From the start two horses dominated as Fairway went to the lead from
    Sunline. Turning for home Sunline tried to kick clear but Fairway stayed with the mare as
    the pair raced well clear of the field. They went stride for stride until the final 50m
    where Fairway edged ahead to win narrowly from Sunline with Diatribe running on for third.
    The following race was the Group 2 Edward Manifold Stakes for 3yo fillies where So
    Gorgeous gave nothing else a chance winning easily from Shelbourne Lass. </font></small></p>

    moved to Caulfield where Sky Heights (below) returned to his best defeating another top
    WFA field in the Group 1 Caulfield Stakes. The Group 1 Caulfield Guineas was won in
    dominating fashion by Skalato (below) from Show a Heart but the winner returned a positive
    swab and was ultimately disqualified. Umrum returned for his third run in the Group 1
    Toorak Hcp taking it out for the second successive year from Go Flash Go. Falvelon (below)
    won the Group 2 Schillaci Stakes and went on to win the Group 2 Schweppes Stakes on Cox
    Plate day before being invited to represent Australia in the Hong Kong International
    Sprint run in December. The Group 1 Thousand Guineas over the mile for 3yo fillies was run
    midweek and So Gorgeous was expected to dominate again but it was All Time High (top of
    page) who relished the longer course to win as So Gorgeous finished well back and headed
    for a spell. All Time High is a half sister to All Archie and All Our Mob out of former
    smart racemare All Sold. </small></font></p>

    and third in the Turnbull Stakes Fairway (below)&nbsp; and Diatribe renewed their rivalry
    in the Caulfield Cup. Sent out as favourite Fairway led most of the way as the race was
    run at a torrid pace as Diatribe stayed back enjoying the solid staying test. Over the
    final stages Diatribe dashed past the tiring Fairway to win in record time for the 2400m
    with Fairway holding on to third place. </small></font></p>

    to Moonee Valley for the most anticipated race of the spring. Sunline (above)&nbsp; was
    attempting to be the first mare since Flight and the first horse since Kingston Town to
    return to the Cox Plate winners circle for the second time but rivals such as Sky Heights,
    Tie The Knot, Testa Rossa, Oliver Twist and Shogun Lodge where expected to make it a tough
    assignment. By the 700m mark Sunline had put the race beyond doubt striding well clear as
    the opposition struggled. She ran to the line in a race of her own winning by a record
    equalling seven lengths from Diatribe with Referral a nose away third. Soon after Sunline
    along with Adam and Mr Innocent were invited to compete in the Hong Kong International
    Mile. The Aami Vase was taken out by Skalato as he continued towards the VRC Derby. The
    following day the Geelong Cup was run after being postponed from earlier during the week
    due to torrential rain that swept across Victoria. The race itself was taken out by
    Savrocca from Apache King while the Listed Geelong Derby Trial was won by the Lee Freedman
    trained Bush Padre. In New Zealand King Keitel previewed his future Brisbane carnival
    assault in winning the Group 3 Challenge Plate. </small></font></p>
