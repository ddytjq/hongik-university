<H1><A NAME="conf">Nationwide Conference</A></H1>
<H2>Founded: 1979</H2>
<P>The Alliance Premier League was formed in 1979 as a national
semi-professional championship. Its formation was partly motivated by the desire
to increase the chances of a non-league club gaining election to the Football
League. The APL members agreed that only one club from the league (normally the
champions) would be nominated for election to the Football League. Up until 1979
the leading semi-professional clubs outside the Football League played in the
Southern League and Northern Premier League. Each year a number of ambitious
clubs from these leagues would apply for membership of the Football League. The
prospective members could usually count on a reasonable level of support, but as
the votes would be spread amongst them it was unusual for one team to garner
enough votes to gain election (although 4 new members had been elected to the
Football League in the previous 10 years). By agreeing that only one club would
seek election, the APL member clubs hoped that that club would gain election
more often than not. However, apart from Altrincham in 1980 who failed by a
single vote, no APL club came close to gaining election. After lengthy
negotiations with the league an agreement was reached in 1986 under which the
APL champions would replace the bottom club of the Football League from 1987
onwards providing that they met the League's entry criteria.</P>
<P>In 1992, former Conference champions Maidstone United ran into financial
difficulties and resigned from the League on the eve of the new season. The
League reacted by tightening their entry criteria and inisited that prospective
members must meet them by December 31st prior to any application. As a result no
club was promoted from 1993 to 1996. The 1996 Conference champions, Stevenage
Borough, took legal action after being denied promotion and although the action
was unsuccessful the League have since relaxed their time limit to April 30th.
In 1996-97 the leading three championship contenders, who had each won the
championship and been denied promotion in the previous three years, all met the
promotion criteria and champions Macclesfield Town took their place in the
Nationwide League in 1997-98. They were followed in 1998 by Halifax Town who
became the fourth team to regain their league status, five years after losing it
 to Wycombe Wanderers.</P>
<P>At the end of the 1997-98 season the league terminated their long
association with sponsors Vauxhall. The league was intially unsponsored for the
1998-99 season and was known simply as The Football Conference, with the
intention of increasing public awareness of the league's name. Midway through
the season a new sponsorship deal was signed and the competition became the
Nationwide Conference.</P>
<P>At the 1998 AGM, it was decided to form a second division to operate from
the 1999-2000 season subject to FA approval. This would have involved relegating
only one club at the end of the 1998-99 season to be replaced by the winners of
a play-off between the three feeder leagues. However the plan was blocked by the
FA and the Conference continued to operate as a single division in season
1999-2000.</P>
<P>In March 2000 the Football League agreed in principle to increase promotion and
relegation with The Conference to two clubs per season. This is expected to take
effect from the 2000-01 season with the second promotion place being decided by
a system of play-offs.

<H2>Structure</H2>
<P>1 division of 22 clubs.</P>
<P>The league originally consisted of 20 clubs. Initially three clubs was
relegated at the end of the season and replaced by the champions of the
<A HREF="unibond.html">Northern Premier League</A> and of each of the two
divisions of the <A HREF="docmarten.html">Southern League</A>. Membership was
increased to 22 in 1980 when Dagenham and Enfield of the <A HREF="isth.html">Isthmian
League</A> were invited to join. From 1982 one of the promotion place previously
allocated to the Southern League was given to the Isthmian League. The league
had indicated in recent years that it would like to expand to 24 clubs. However,
the league now favours forming a second division but the FA will not sanction
such a move at present.</P>
