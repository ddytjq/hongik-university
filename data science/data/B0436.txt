          be your residential address . It must be the same address given to the 
          Society for all accounts with the Society.<br>
          <br>
          The first named account holder in the application form will be the Society's 
          member with investor membership rights. These additional rights include 
          voting and rights to receive notices of meetings. If the account changes 
          to a different first named account holder that means those membership 
          rights cease for the first named account holder on the changeover. The 
          new first named account holder will commence their investing membership 
          rights from the date of the record being amended at the Society.<br>
          <br>
          The member should be the person on whose behalf money is being invested 
          eg the beneficiary under a trust document or will, the donor (the "giver") 
          of a power of attorney, a child where the parent acts as nominee (ie 
          as an agent for the child). <br>
          <br>
          There is one exception to this which is where it is an organisation, 
          eg a club, society or charity where the member must be the nominee/controller 
          of the account as agent for the organisation. The reason for this is 
          that the member with the Society must be an individual. In this case 
          the organisation must be made aware that the membership rights are with 
          the controller. If that person changes then the membership rights cease 
          when the Society's records are changed and new membership rights will 
          start again.<br>
          <br>
          The first named account holder is the Representative Joint Shareholder. 
          It is important to remember that this person can only have membership 
          rights once. If that person is also a Representative Joint Borrower 
          or operates an account for an organisation, membership rights exist 
          only once.</font></P>

          </b><br>
          When you open an account we will tell you the interest rate on your 
          account and how the interest will be paid or deducted. This is also 
          available in the Interest Rate Leaflet given to you at the time the 
          account is opened. Interest rates are available on our website and telephone 
          helpline and by asking staff. In addition you will be told how interest 
          rates will be changed (see below).<br>

          which covers a particular account, we may change at any time the rate 
          of interest to be paid on your investment. Variations may include changes 
          which:<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">i</font>. mean we do not pay interest when the 
          amount in the account is below a particular level; <br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">ii</font>. introduce or alter "banding" provisions 
          under which we pay different rates depending upon the amount in the 
          account from time to time. <br>
          <br>
          4.2 We may change at any time the rate of interest to be paid on your 
          investment if we reasonably believe that the change is needed for any 
          of the following reasons (which may relate to circumstances existing 
          at the time or those which are expected to apply in the near future) 
          - <br>

          (including interest rates generally or the terms on which similar accounts 
          are offered by other building societies, banks or anyone else providing 
          financial services);<br>
          <br>

          <b>5. How we calculate interest<br>
          <br>
          </b>We calculate interest on the sum you invest from the day after we 
          receive it up to and including the day before you make a withdrawal; 
          but this will not apply where special conditions for particular accounts 
          provide otherwise. We will give you a full explanation of how interest 
          is calculated if you request this from us.<br>
          <br>
          From time to time, we offer new savings and investment accounts. If 
          you have a savings account, other than a fixed-rate account, which has 
          been &quot;superseded&quot; because:<br>
          <br>
          &#149; new accounts are no longer opened by us; or<br>
          <br>
          &#149; the account is not actively promoted;<br>
          <br>
          we will either:<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">(a)</font> keep the interest rate on the superseded 
          account at the same level as an account with similar features from the 
          current range; or<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">(b)</font> switch the superseded account to an 
          account with similar features from the current range.<br>
          <br>
          Examples of similar features include notice periods, types of withdrawals, 
          numbers of free withdrawals, how money is paid into and drawn out of 
          the account.<br>
          <br>
          This means that the interest rate on your account will always be at 
          least as good as the interest rate on an account with similar features 
          from the current range.<br>
          <br>
          Where there is no account with &quot;similar features&quot; we will, 
          within 30 days of your account becoming superseded, contact you to:<br>
          <br>
          &#149; tell you that the account is superseded;<br>
          <br>
          &#149; tell you about our other accounts; and<br>
          <br>
          &#149; help you to switch accounts without any notice period and without 
          any additional charges.<br>
          <br>
          Rates on our superseded issues are always available at our branches.<br>
          <br>
          <b>6. How you can receive interest<br>
          </b><br>
          You can generally have your interest<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">i</font>. credited to the account;<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">ii</font>. paid to your bank account;<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">iii</font>. transferred to another account with 
          us.<br>
          <br>
          This will not apply where special conditions for particular accounts 
          provide otherwise.<br>

          <b>7. Charges on accounts<br>
          <br>
          </b>7.1 We can make reasonable charges for items relating to the day 
          to day running of your account. These charges are transactional charges 
          and reflect the expenses we incur and the cost of staff time and the 
          use of our office/computer facilities. We will tell you about these 
          charges on our Interest Rate Leaflet if they are applicable. Our website 
          and telephone helpline will also include them. For charges that do not 
          apply to the daily running of an account for example a duplicate statement, 
          unpaid cheque or direct debit, stopping a cheque, telegraphic transfer, 
          these will be provided to you at any time on request and in any event 
          before the service is provided to you (unless it is a charge for an 
          unpaid cheque). These are also provided in the Interest Rate Leaflet 
          for your information purposes and reflect the costs of our staff time 
          and the use of our office/computer facilities. <br>
          <br>
          7.2 We can change the charges we make at any time. Changes may include 
          the abolition of, or amendment to, existing charges, or the introduction 
          of new charges and may be made if we reasonably believe that the change 
          is needed for any of the following reasons (which may relate to circumstances 
          existing at the time or those which are expected to apply in the near 
          future) -<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">i</font>. to reflect general market conditions 
          and standards (including the levels of charges of other building societies, 
          banks or anyone else providing financial services);<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">ii</font>. so we can compete more effectively with 
          other building societies, banks and anyone else providing financial 
          services;<br>

          <font color="ff0000">iii</font>. our costs have increased or are expected 
          to do so;<br>

          law, decisions of an Ombudsman, regulator or similar person, or any 
          code of practice with which we intend to comply.<br>
          <br>
          We can also change the charges for any other valid reason where we reasonably 
          believe change is appropriate.<br>
          <br>
          7.3 If we introduce or increase a day to day transactional charge we 
          will inform you personally by giving you no less than 30 days notice 
          by letter, statement or e-mail before the charge takes effect. <br>
          <br>
          7.4 If we introduce or increase any other charge that is not a transactional 
          charge, i.e. a charge that you do not use on a day to day basis, then 
          we will inform you before you use the service or at any time you ask. 
          These charges will be updated and will appear in the Interest Rate Leaflet.<br>
          <br>
          7.5 If you have a fixed term account the product leaflet will detail 
          any extra charges for early withdrawal if permissible under the account 
          terms.<br>
          <br>
          <b>8. Minimum and Maximum opening investments/holdings<br>
          <br>
          </b>The minimum and maximum opening investments and holdings are contained 
          in the special conditions for particular accounts. Subject to these 
          the maximum total investment in an account or by an individual is £300,000. 
          The minimum opening balance in any account must be maintained at all 
          times. If your balance drops beneath this minimum amount we will give 
          you the opportunity to make up the difference. If you fail to do this 
          within a month the account will be closed by us and your investment 
          returned to you.<br>
          <br>
          <b>9. Withdrawals/Payments<br>
          <br>
          </b>Withdrawals are subject to the special conditions for particular 
          accounts and to any branch/agency withdrawal limits which we reasonably 
          impose. Any cash withdrawal is limited to £300 for security purposes 
          subject to account conditions.<br>
          <br>
          You are not permitted to make withdrawals:<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">i</font>. if they would cause the account to become 
          overdrawn. This includes any additional interest due to the Society 
          that you must pay as a result of your not giving the required notice 
          prior to any withdrawal. If an account is overdrawn you will cease to 
          be a shareholding member.<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">ii</font>. from a passbook, unless you produce 
          the passbook at the time of the withdrawal.<br>
          <br>
          In exceptional circumstances, we may have to suspend your right to make 
          withdrawals from your account for a period, and we may not be able to 
          give you prior notice of this.<br>
          <br>
          Without notice we may limit at any time the amount which may be withdrawn 
          in respect of any account if we reasonably consider it is necessary 
          in order to protect the interests of the membership of the Society as 
          a whole.<br>
          <br>
          We will not send cheques to third parties in the post, this must be 
          undertaken by you.<br>
          <br>
          Any cheque that you require us to draw to pay a third party cannot be 
          stopped unless we have clear evidence of fraud.<br>
          <br>
          We do not permit withdrawals to be paid out of your investment account 
          by Direct Debit or Standing Order.<br>
          <br>
          Three working days must be allowed before withdrawals can be made against 
          a bank credit which is transmitted through the Banking Automated Clearing 
          System (BACS).<br>
          <br>
          If you send a cheque through the post it will help to prevent fraud 
          if you clearly write the name of the person you are paying the cheque 
          to and put extra information about them on the cheque. For example, 
          if you write a cheque to Hinckley and Rugby Building Society please 
          ensure that the account name of the person to whom you wish to pay it 
          to is included on the cheque.<br>

          <b>10. Transaction Limits<br>
          </b><br>
          To reduce queuing time and to maintain our high level of customer service 
          please note our limits on certain types of transactions.<br>
          <br>
          Receipts per day per customer<br>

          no more than 5 bags).<br>
          <br>
          The Society will continue to accept coin deposits above these limits 
          for charities and Young Savers but you will be asked to help us to help 
          the rest of our customers by counting and bagging your change in advance 
          and avoiding peak times if possible.<br>

          <b>11. Uncleared Cheques etc<br>
          <br>
          </b>You will not normally be permitted to withdraw money against uncleared 
          cheques. 10 working days must be allowed before withdrawals can be made 
          against a cheque after we have received it from you. Faster clearance 
          of cheques is available on payment of a special clearance fee set out 
          in the Interest Rate Leaflet. This service is not available when opening 
          an account. However, we are dependent on the banking clearing system 
          and cannot guarantee the period in which the cheque will clear.<br>
          <br>
          We will not accept out of date cheques. A cheque is usually valid for 
          six months from the date shown. However Post Office and Giro cheques 
          are only valid for three months.<br>

          for particular accounts.<br>

          We can repay to you all or part of your investment at any time, without 
          giving any reason, after giving you at least one month's notice, except 
          where the investment has been accepted for a fixed term which has not 
          expired or there are exceptional circumstances, eg, fraud. You can close 
          your account at any time, without giving any reason, after giving any 
          notice required by the special conditions applying to the account, except 
          where the investment has been accepted for a fixed term which has not 
          expired.<br>
          <br>
          Where we make the repayment to you in person, or by post to you and

          you ask for it.<br>

          <br>
          To help you compare interest rates on all our savings and investment 
          accounts more easily, we will send you, at least once a year, a summary 
          of these products and the current interest rates unless the account 
          has less than £100 in it. This summary will also include:<br>

          In addition, we will also tell you the different interest rates which 
          have applied to the account during the year unless you have received 
          personal notices of interest rate changes on your account which will 
          have been sent to you in respect of accounts which are not mainly run

          </b>Payments of interest (or otherwise) made by us on an account will 
          be subject to any taxes which affect the payment.<br>
          <br>
          <b>15. Joint accounts/Trust accounts<br>
          <br>
          </b>The following provisions apply to joint accounts/trust accounts 
          (some of the provisions being contained in our Rules - see below):<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">i</font>. Only the account holder whose name appears 
          first in our records ("the Representative Joint Shareholder") will obtain 
          any membership rights (eg the right to receive notices of meetings) 
          arising from the account holding;<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">ii</font>. Condition 15 (i) is subject to rights 
          given to second-named joint shareholders under any Act of Parliament;<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">iii</font>. Joint shareholders can choose the order 
          in which their names appear in our records and can later change their 
          minds. Any amendment made is effected when our records are changed;<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">iv</font>. Joint shareholders can choose whether 
          account withdrawals are to be made on the signature of one holder (in 
          which case all the funds can be withdrawn by that account holder in 
          the account) or all holders and can later change their minds. Any amendment 
          made is effected when our records are changed;<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">v</font>. For the purpose of this condition (and 
          for certain Inland Revenue returns) we will treat joint account holders 
          (but not trustees or nominees) as being entitled to the sum invested 
          in the account in equal shares. The Society will not accept accounts 
          where money is held in different shareholding interests (The Society 
          Rules - 4 (6));<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">vi</font>. On proof of the death of any joint account 
          holder, the survivor or survivors will be the only person or persons 
          recognised by us as having any ownership of or interest in the account 
          and the survivor or survivors shall be entitled, subject to these terms, 
          to operate the account on the same terms;<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">vii</font>. We do not have to recognise the interest 
          or claim of any person other than the account holder(s) in respect of 
          money held in any account, nor will we be liable in any way for failing 
          to recognise such interest or claim, except as required by law;<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">viii</font>. If the relationship on a joint account 
          ceases you must inform us if the account is to be closed or you wish 
          one name to remain on the account only;<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">ix</font>. We may freeze the account if we are 
          made aware that there is a dispute in relation to the funds held in 
          the account;<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">x</font>. We will send to joint account holders 
          who live at different addresses separate statements if we are requested 
          to do so at no additional cost.<br>
          <b><br>
          16. Transfers</b><br>
          <br>
          You may, subject to the conditions applying to your account and to our 
          prior approval, transfer your investment to another person on payment 
          to us of any fee which we may decide from time to time. No transfer 
          will be valid unless made in a form approved by us and until registered 
          in our records. We may refuse to permit such a transfer without giving 
          any reason.<br>
          <br>
          <b>17. The Society's Rules<br>
          <br>
          </b>If the Conditions apply to your account you will (except where the 
          account is a deposit account) be a member of the Society and be bound 
          by our Rules; but the Conditions or any relevant special conditions 
          that apply to a particular account will apply where inconsistent with 
          the Rules. (A summary of some of the key provisions of the Rules is 
          set out in the Appendix at the end of these Conditions.)<br>
          <br>
          <b>18. Deposit Accounts<br>
          <br>
          </b>If you have a deposit account, you are not a member of the Society 
          and do not have any voting rights. You are, however, bound under the 
          terms of your account by some of our Rules, which include Rules 4(4) 
          to (7), Rule 5, Rule 6(1) to (3), Rule 8(4) and Rule 9(5), Rule 12(5) 
          and Rule 45 with any necessary consequential amendments being made together 
          with these Conditions except those that relate to membership rights.<br>
          <br>
          <b>19. Unclaimed Balances<br>
          <br>
          </b>If -<br>
          <br>

          enquiry, and<br>

          no payment to or withdrawal from your account and the amount in that 
          account is less than £100, or<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">(b)</font> for a period of 5 years you have made 
          no payment to or withdrawal from your account,<br>
          <br>
          we may decide to close that account and the money in it will be retained 
          by us. If, however, you contact us at a later date we will either open 
          a new account for you and credit that account with that amount of money 
          in the closed account or repay the money to you, with interest, at a 
          rate which we reasonably consider to be appropriate.<br>
          <b><br>
          20. Account Documents<br>
          <br>
          </b>We will issue you with an account document, (eg passbook, certificate 
          or other similar item) which will remain our property. These items are 
          designated by us as account documents. The following will apply to the 
          account document:<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">i</font>. You must forward the account document 
          to us when we ask you to, so that we can bring it up to date, or for 
          any other purpose we reasonably require.<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">ii</font>. You will be responsible for the safe 
          keeping of the account document.<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">iii</font>. You must produce to us the account 
          document before making a withdrawal.<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">iv</font>. If the account document is lost or stolen 
          you must immediately report this to us in writing at our Principal Office.<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">v</font>. After you have;<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">(a)</font> provided such evidence regarding the 
          loss; and <br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">(b)</font> given any indemnity; and <br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">(c)</font> paid any fee<br>
          <br>
          which we may require, we will transfer the amount in the account in 
          our records to a new account and afterwards shall issue you with a new 
          account document after 14 days.<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">vi</font>. If someone other than you produces your 
          account document to us, pretends to be you or to be authorised by you, 
          and is therefore able to withdraw money from your account, you will 
          be liable for the amount of any withdrawals made if you have not notified 
          us in writing of the lost or stolen account document or have acted fraudulently 
          or with negligence.<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">vii</font>. When you have reported the loss or 
          theft of the account document we may issue you with a new account document, 
          but this may be subject to conditions (eg that you pay a charge for 
          the new document). Withdrawals cannot be made for 14 days from the date 
          you report your account document lost.<br>

          relating to any account (other than interest rate and charges)<br>
          <br>
          </b>21.1 We can change these Conditions and any special conditions applying 
          to particular accounts at any time (other than the rate of interest 
          and charges) as set out below. Changes may include the removal of or 
          amendment to conditions or the inclusion of new conditions, and may 
          be made if we reasonably believe that the change is needed for any of 
          the following reasons (which may relate to circumstances existing at 
          the time or those which are expected to apply in the near future) - 
          <br>
          <br>

          21.2 We may also change these Conditions and any special conditions 
          applying to particular accounts for any other valid reason where we 
          reasonably believe change is appropriate.<br>
          <br>
          21.3 A change which in our reasonable opinion improves a service, or 
          provides for additional services, or which otherwise benefits you or 
          does not materially alter the nature of our contract with you, may be 
          introduced with immediate effect and without notice, but we will tell 
          you within 30 days of the change as set out in 21.4 (i) - (iii) beneath.<br>
          <br>
          21.4 Any change which is neither to your advantage or disadvantage will 
          be effective, unless special conditions for particular accounts provide 
          otherwise, only after at least 30 days' notice is given to you in at 
          least one of the following ways;<br>
          <br>
          <font color="ff0000">i</font>. by individual notification by letter

          Office or web page in conjunction with advertisements in two or more

          <br>
          &#149; ignore any notice period on your account for at least 60 days 
          starting from the date of the notice so that you can, if you wish, switch 
          your account or close it.<br>
          <br>
          You will not have to pay any additional charges or additional interest 
          as a result of this switch or closure during this 60 day period.<br>
          <br>
          21.6 If there have been significant changes in any one year or a lot 
          of minor changes, we will give or send you a copy of the new terms and

          placing a prominent notice in the branch or agency informing you of 
          the alternative facilities you may use in order to conduct your account

          for it. (Rule 4)<br>
