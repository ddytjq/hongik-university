Recommendations for Sequencing Targets Announced in the Federal Register December 27, 2001. <a href="http://www.sc.doe.gov/ober/sequencing_targets.html">

A 1994 spinoff from the Human Genome Project, the Microbial Genome Program's 
  goal is to completely sequence the genomes of microbes, primarily prokaryotes. 
  However, unlike the human genome, which is taking years to 
  complete, many microbial genomes can be completely sequenced in weeks or months and with recent advances in sequencing technologies, even days. 
  Only a few years ago, most scientists could not have imagined having access 
  to the complete genetic sequence of more than a few microbes. Today the completed 
  sequences of more than 20 prokaryotes, in addition to many viruses and higher organisms 
  such as yeast and the roundworm, are available in public databases and are being 
  actively used by academic, medical, and industrial scientists to make comparisons 
  not possible previously. The completed genome of one microbe, <EM>Methanococcus 
  jannaschii</EM>, confirmed the existence of a third major branch of life on 
  earth, the Archaea.</P>


<P>In newly sequenced microbial genomes, about 40% of the predicted open reading
frames (potential genes) typically do not have matches in existing databases; this
means that even though investigators have high confidence in the existence of
these potential genes, their function and biological value are unknown. This
exciting finding suggests that a large reservoir of interesting proteins and much
fascinating biology remain to be discovered. One of the hardest biological
problems, and one in which bioinformatics is beginning to have an impact, is to
predict protein structure from primary amino acid sequence. Ultimately, scientists
expect to understand the functions of unknown proteins, starting with their gene
sequences.  </P>

<P> </P>

<P>The possible uses of this information are staggering. Microbes, incredibly, make
up around 60% of the Earth's biomass. They have survived on the planet for over
3.7 billion years and have been found in every conceivable environment, surviving extremes of heat, cold, radiation, pressure, salt, and
acid--often where no other forms of life can exist. This rich diversity means that
microbes long ago "solved" many problems for which scientists have been
actively seeking answers. </P>


<P>Through the study and understanding of a diverse group of microbes, solutions 
  are nearer for DOE mission challenges in environmental cleanup, medicine, agriculture, industrial 
  processes, energy production and use, and countering biological threats, to name a few. For example, <EM>M. jannaschii</EM>'s 
  ability to produce methane may have implications for new forms of fuel generation, 
  and <EM>Deinococcus radiodurans</EM> has potential for cleanup of toxic mixed 
  waste sites containing radionuclides, in addition to heavy metals and organic 
  solvents, because it can survive extremely high levels of radiation and repair 
  its own radiation-damaged DNA. Understanding the genome sequence of <i>B. anthracis</i>, which causes anthrax, will promote faster detection methods and new treatments.</P>


<P>DOE scientists in the Natural and Accelerated Bioremediation Research (NABIR) 
  program (<i><a href="http://www.lbl.gov/NABIR">www.lbl.gov/NABIR</a></i>) are 
  seeking more effective ways to harness and accelerate the capabilities of microorganisms 
  to help remediate toxic chemicals such as metals and radionuclides at 
  hazardous waste sites. NABIR provides an integrated framework of basic research 
  needed to extend the applicability of bioremediation to many environmental problems 
  found at DOE facilities.</P>

<ul>
  <li><STRONG>Genomic Sequencing</STRONG>. Microbes are selected for draft (~8x coverage) sequencing 
    based on their relevance for energy, the global carbon cycle, and bioremediation.  Sequencing is carried out at the DOE <A HREF="http://www.jgi.doe.gov"Joint Genome Institute"> Joint Genome Institute</a>. Requests for candidate microbes will be announced periodically in the Federal Register.  </li>
  <li><STRONG>DOE Mission Relevance</STRONG>. Information is needed on potentially 
    useful microbial species from environments of potential importance to DOE's 
    waste-remediation, cleanup, and energy-production missions and on environments 
    likely to contain potentially useful microbes. </li>
  <li><STRONG>Leveraged Sequencing</STRONG>. Strategies are needed that use a 
    previously determined microbial genomic sequence to sequence a related species rapidly, accurately, and 
    cost-effectively. </li>
  <li><STRONG>Development of Improved Tools for Annotation and Analysis of Microbial 
    Genomic Sequence Data</STRONG>. This is a critical and fascinating part of 
    MGP because so many identified genes are unrelated to previously discovered 
    genes. These new genes represent exciting opportunities for future basic research 
    and as potential sources of biological resources to be "mined" for future 
    use. </li>
<li><STRONG>Functional Analyses</STRONG>. About 40% of the predicted open reading frames (ORFs) in newly sequenced microbial genomes do not match any previously known genes.  Information about their roles in the physiology of the microbes in which they are found is urgently needed.</li>
<li><STRONG>Hard-to-Culture Microbes and Communities</STRONG>.  Most of what we know of microbes comes from those that are either easy to culture and study, or cause serious human and animal diseases.  These constitute only a small minority of all microbes living in natural environments.  Most of these are part of microbial communities that are very difficult to study but play critical roles in the Earth's ecology.  Better approaches to studying these microbes and the communities of which they are a part are needed.</li>
