<H2><A NAME="PotEU">V. PHYSICS OF THE EARLY UNIVERSE </A></H2>

<P>
In contrast to the observational studies of the CMBR, galaxies,
and large-scale structure, the field of the physics of the early
universe involves concepts that are less familiar, more theoretical,
and more daunting. A little background, supplementary to the sidebars
(<A HREF="1.html#EarlyUniverse">The Early Universe</A>, <A HREF="1.html#CosmicPicture">The Cosmic Picture</A>)
is helpful.
<P>
As described in the sidebars (<A HREF="1.html#EarlyUniverse">The Early Universe</A>,
<A HREF="1.html#CosmicPicture">The Cosmic Picture</A>), the universe
is cooling and decreasing in density as it expands. Since temperature
is simply a measure of mean energy per particle, the energy available
for particle interactions is also declining. If we imagine running
the universe's clock backward toward zero, before the first 100
seconds, the CMBR would be blindingly hot and energetic, and more
and more energetic events would become possible, including the
creation of multitudes of elementary particles that are not stable
at the present energy density of the universe.
<P>
An important concept of modern physics is the phase transition,
the idea that the nature of the interactions of particles can
change with available energy. The freezing and boiling of water
are familiar examples of phase transitions. In the early universe,
the nature of physical law itself is thought to have undergone
a series of phase transitions, with enormous consequences for
the physics of that era. The history of the early universe and
the laws of physics are intimately intertwined--each one can be
illuminated by studying the other. Moreover, energies in the Big
Bang reached up to 10<SUP>14</SUP> times higher than any conceivable
terrestrial accelerator, and these energies probe realms that
are inaccessible to our laboratory experiments. For this reason
the Big Bang is sometimes called the &quot;poor man's particle
accelerator.&quot;
<P>
The aim of early-universe cosmology is to trace the successive
transitions of forces and particles from the earliest, fiercely
hot moments of the Big Bang to the epoch of atom formation at
4,000 K (see section II on the cosmic microwave background radiation).
Along the way, at certain critical temperatures, precipitous changes
in the state of the universe occurred. Some of these changes have
observable consequences, called relics<I>, </I>that persist to
this day and provide key tests of models. Some of these relics-the
ratio of photons to atoms and the nature of the large-scale fluctuations
in the matter distribution as detected by the COBE satellite and
studies of large-scale structure--are discussed above. Other fundamental
questions, such as why the universe is homogeneous on the largest
scales, and what is the nature of dark matter, also appear to
have their answers in the physics of the early universe. 
<P>
<A NAME="Fig12">The sidebar &quot;</A><A HREF="1.html#EarlyUniverse">The Early Universe</A>&quot;
treats the first 100&nbsp;seconds after the Big Bang. During this
period, the universe was opaque to all forms of electromagnetic
radiation, and so astronomers cannot make direct observations
of the events at these early times. Nevertheless, important experimental
and observational information can be obtained that leads to reasonable
physical inferences about events and conditions during this period.
Progress in the study of the early universe has been spectacular
in recent years. 
<P>
The earliest state of the universe that can be addressed by physical
theories is called the quantum gravity era (see sidebar, &quot;<A HREF="1.html#CosmicPicture">The Cosmic Picture</A>&quot;),
because during that era the temperature and density of the universe
were so high that gravity must be described by a quantum field
theory of some kind. The four forces of nature (gravity, the weak
force of radioactive decay, electromagnetism, and the strong nuclear
force) were probably completely unified during this era, and space
and time could not be differentiated. After this almost unimaginably
remote epoch, the universe cooled sufficiently for gravity to
be described by Einstein's general relativity theory, but the
temperature was still sufficiently high that the other three forces
of nature remained unified (the grand unification era). Many theorists
believe the phase transition that marked the end of the grand
unification era was followed by a period of inflation. (Inflation
is discussed below.) 
<P>
As time progressed and the universe cooled further, additional
phase transitions occurred, such as the end of the symmetry between
weak interactions and electromagnetic interactions and the transition
from free quarks to quarks bound into hadrons. (Protons and neutrons
are the most familiar example of hadrons.)
<P>
At very high temperatures quantum interactions create and destroy
particles, leading to an equilibrium in the number density of
each particle type. However, particle interaction rates depend
on temperature, and as the universe cooled, interactions occurred
less frequently. When an interaction rate became small relative
to the expansion rate of the universe, the equilibrating process
effectively ended. The abundances of the reacting particles were
thereafter fixed. Although the expansion rate of the universe
slowed as it became cooler and less dense, particle interaction
rates decreased even more rapidly.
<P>
Although the abundance of atoms relative to photons is likely
to be a relic from an earlier, hotter epoch whose physics is not
yet well understood, the conditions that existed when the universe
was 1&nbsp;second old can now be explored in the high-energy physics
laboratory. Cosmologists are therefore more confident in their
modeling of the constituents and the physical processes at work.
For example, by the time the universe was 1 second old, it had
cooled and expanded to the point where neutrinos, whose weak interaction
with other matter decreases as a function of temperature, effectively
ceased interacting with matter. This change acted to stabilize
the ratio of neutrons to protons. With further cooling, positrons
(antielectrons) annihilated most of the electrons, and neutrons
quickly attached to the protons, forming all the deuterium (an
atomic nucleus consisting of one proton and one neutron) and most
of the helium now present in the universe.
<P>
Thus, many interactions that were close to thermal equilibrium
in the early universe later froze out at a predictable epoch,
and left relics, some of which survive to the present day (see
<A HREF="#Table1">Table 1</A>). One example is the abundance of
primordial helium and deuterium, discussed in more detail below.
<H3><A NAME="PNandDM">Primordial Nucleosynthesis and Dark Matter</A>
</H3>

<P>
Along with the Hubble expansion and the cosmic microwave background
radiation, one of the pillars of the Big Bang theory is its successful
prediction of the abundances of the light elements deuterium,
helium, and lithium. The Big Bang theory says that when the universe
was about 1 second old and had a temperature of 10<SUP>10</SUP>
K, nuclear processes should have started that eventually yielded
certain well-specified abundances for these light elements (see
<A HREF="#Table1">Table 1</A>). The abundances of these light
elements have all been found to be in agreement with the predictions
of Big Bang theory within the accuracy of the measurements. Even
the abundance of lithium relative to hydrogen, predicted to be
1 part in 10 billion, matches the observations. Furthermore, the
Big Bang theory predicts that the abundances will fit well only
if there are no more than three families of neutrinos-a condition
that was confirmed recently at the Large Electron-Positron (LEP)
Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. Thus, the Big Bang theory's detailed
predictions, even though they are based on the nature of the universe
when it was only 1 second old, have been confirmed by observations
and experiments.
<P>
The light elements shown in <A HREF="#Table1">Table 1</A>, with
abundances ranging from about 23 percent for helium to 1 part
in 10<SUP>10</SUP> for lithium, all fit with the Big Bang theoretical
predictions on one condition-that the one adjustable parameter
of the theory, <FONT FACE="Symbol">W</FONT><SUB>B</SUB> (the ratio
of the mean density of ordinary matter (baryons) to the critical
density in the universe), has a value between 0.01 and 0.1. The
nucleosynthesis calculations thus imply either that (1) the total
density of the universe is much less than the critical density
and it will never stop expanding, or (2) the dominant component
of the universe is not ordinary (baryonic) matter.

<P>
The value of <FONT FACE="Symbol">W</FONT><SUB>B</SUB> predicted
by primordial nucleosynthesis can be compared to that observed
in the universe. The mass density of luminous material in stars
and galaxies is small, <FONT FACE="Symbol">W</FONT><SUB>visible</SUB>
&lt; 0.01, while the hot gas in galaxy clusters, which astronomers
can detect by its x-ray emission, contributes perhaps <FONT FACE="Symbol">W</FONT><SUB>gas</SUB>&nbsp;~&nbsp;0.03.
The sum of these values lies in the range consistent with primordial
nucleosynthesis. At the same time, dynamical models based on the
relative motions of galaxies, and the way spiral galaxies rotate,
argue that galaxies have more mass than is seen in their detected
stars and gas. These dynamical arguments imply that each galaxy
has an invisible halo of dark matter that is about 10 times the
visible mass. Moreover, consideration of large-scale flows seems
to indicate a still larger amount of dark matter on scales much
larger than single galaxies. Perhaps there is even enough to be
consistent with a total matter density of <FONT FACE="Symbol">W</FONT>
~ 1, or at least <FONT FACE="Symbol">W</FONT> &gt; <FONT FACE="Symbol">W</FONT><SUB>B</SUB>.
This implies that there must exist some unknown form of matter
that dominates the mass density of the universean awkward situation
for cosmologists<I>.</I>
<P>
There are other theoretical reasons to expect that <FONT FACE="Symbol">W</FONT>
= 1, or in other words that the total mass density is exactly
equal to the critical value that just closes the universe. <FONT FACE="Symbol">W</FONT>
is an unstable quantity in an expanding universe. If <FONT FACE="Symbol">W</FONT>
is below 1 it will rapidly become much less than 1 as expansion
proceeds. Conversely, if <FONT FACE="Symbol">W</FONT> is greater
than 1, it will grow to values much greater than&nbsp;1. Only
if <FONT FACE="Symbol">W</FONT> = 1 does it stay at 1; all other
values diverge to either zero or infinity. A finite, non-zero
value of <FONT FACE="Symbol">W</FONT> today, other than <FONT FACE="Symbol">W</FONT>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,
implies that it must have been extremely close to 1 at the beginning
of the universe. Cosmologists have puzzled over this fine-tuning
problem for decades, but just in the past decade or so, considerations
of the early universe have motivated a sensible resolution to
this question--inflation.
<H3><A NAME="EoIaGUToM">Epoch of Inflation and Grand Unified Theories
of Matter</A> </H3>

<P>
After the Big Bang, the temperature of the early universe was
so high that the four fundamental forces of nature are believed
to have been merged. In the grand unification era that followed,
the grand unified theory (GUT) predicts that all the forces except
gravity were of equal strength. Modern theories of these forces
involve a concept known as symmetry breaking, in which the lowest-energy
state (the vacuum) is not symmetric at the low temperatures of
the present universe. As time progressed, the temperature decreased,
and the vacuum underwent a phase transition from a symmetric state
of higher energy. The higher energy of the &quot;false vacuum&quot;
can in principle act like a non-zero cosmological constant, <FONT FACE="Symbol">L</FONT>&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Symbol">'</FONT>&nbsp;0,
which, according to Einstein's general relativity theory, can
drive an extremely rapid, accelerating expansion of the universe.
This expansion is called inflation (see &quot;Measuring the Cosmological
Parameters&quot; in section IV) and is supposed to have occurred
in the first instants after the creation of the universe (see
<A HREF="1.html#CosmicPictureIllustration">&quot;The Cosmic Picture&quot;</A>
and <A HREF="1.html#EarlyUniverseIllustration">&quot;The Early Universe&quot;</A>).
In a very short time (10<SUP>-32</SUP> s), the early universe
may have expanded by a greater factor than it has in the billions
of years since. Thus, inflation is intimately connected with our
understanding of elementary-particle physics.
<P>
Inflation beautifully explains three long-standing problems of
cosmology. In the normal theory, regions of space separated by
a distance greater than the distance light has traveled in the
time since the Big Bang are effectively disconnected from each
other. In traditional, non-inflationary models, there is no reason
for such regions to be similar. For example, since disconnected
regions can never have exchanged energy, why should they be at
exactly the same temperature? Energy exchange between nearby regions
could result in small patches with uniform temperature, but CMBR
measurements tell us that large regions are nearly equal in temperature.
Because inflation can quickly expand an extremely tiny volume
into a vastly larger region of space, it would allow a small,
uniform patch to expand to cover our entire observable universe,
leading to a nearly uniform temperature for the CMBR. 
<P>
At the same time, there must remain some minimum level of bumpiness
even in the uniform patches, because quantum mechanics and the
uncertainty principle require it. Inflation magnifies these tiny
fluctuations into the CMBR anisotropy that astronomers see today
and the large-scale structure of matter in the universe. Indeed,
the variation in amplitude of fluctuations of different angular
size is consistent with the expectations of the inflationary model.
Inflation takes microscopic quantum noise and blows it up to create
the seeds of galaxies and large-scale structure. 
<P>
A third advantage of inflation is that it forces the spatial curvature
of the universe to be negligibly small on a cosmological scale
so that space is flat (i.e., euclidean geometry applies). This
flatness is a direct consequence of the tremendous expansion expected
during inflation. A small closed surface such as a balloon has
an obvious curvature, but if expanded to the size of Earth, its
curvature is much less apparent. The absence of curvature in an
inflationary universe would imply that today, the density parameter
<FONT FACE="Symbol">W</FONT> should be close to unity. Thus, an
inflationary phase in the early universe naturally solves the
fine-tuning problem mentioned above. 
<P>
The panel emphasizes that inflation is an idea, not a complete
or well-tested physical theory. In addition to the original version
described here, many different variants have been presented, some
with inflation occurring during the quantum gravity era, others
with inflation occurring much later, each driven by different
mechanisms. Although our understanding of particle physics is
incomplete at these energies, and we have no understanding of
the details of the inflationary epoch, inflation is an attractive
concept because of its ability to resolve several long-standing
cosmological conundrums. Many cosmologists are convinced that
such an episode must have occurred.
<H3><A NAME="PTaDMC">Particle Theory and Dark Matter Candidates</A>
</H3>

<P>
Astronomers have found strong evidence for a major dark matter
component of the universe; the visible matter does not add up
to the total amount of matter measured by dynamical means. Could
the dark matter be ordinary baryonic matter in a form that doesn't
shineperhaps brown dwarf stars, black holes, or hot intergalactic
gas? Apparently not, according to the calculations of primordial
nucleosynthesis, which work only if the density of baryons is
less than 0.1 of the critical value (<FONT FACE="Symbol">W</FONT><SUB>B</SUB>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.1).
Thus the bulk of the dark matter must be composed of an unknown
form of matter. What could it be? Particle physics has some candidates
that are discussed below, and the astronomical behavior of dark
matter offers some clues. Observations show that the dark matter
is much less clumped than the visible matter. Therefore, the two
kinds must interact only weakly, mainly via the gravitational
force. Computer simulations of the formation of large-scale structure
also provide valuable information about the behavior of the dark
matter, which plays an important role in shaping the structure.
These studies show that the non-baryonic dark matter candidates
can be divided into two categories depending on the velocity with
which the particles were moving when the universe became dominated
by matter (<A HREF="1.html#CosmicPictureIllustration">&quot;The Cosmic Picture&quot;</A>
and <A HREF="1.html#EarlyUniverseIllustration">&quot;The Early Universe&quot;</A>).
During this epoch, a rapidly moving particle (e.g., because its
mass is small) is considered hot dark matter; a slowly moving
particle is considered cold dark matter. Currently, the cold dark
matter candidates, or a mixture of hot and cold, give the best
agreement between computer simulation results and the observed
large-scale structure.
<P>
Most cosmologists believe that the unknown matter needed to explain
the &quot;missing mass&quot; exists in the form of some yet-undetected
elementary particle-a particle that is fundamentally different
from ordinary matter. Such a particle would be a relic of some
process in the high-energy-physics era, but whether from the grand
unification era or some later era is not known. Clearly, it is
important to identify this non-baryonic dark matter, by direct
searches and by accelerator experiments, with particle theory
providing guidance to focus the experiments. Chief among the theoretical
elementary-particle candidates for non-baryonic dark matter are
weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), axions, and neutrinos
with finite mass. Of these, only neutrinos are known to exist,
but they are usually assumed to have zero mass. The experimental
upper limit for the electron neutrino mass is about 7 electron-volts
(eV; the mass of the electron is about 511,000 eV). A sea of primordial
neutrinos with this mass would provide sufficient dark mass to
make <FONT FACE="Symbol">W</FONT>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1. However, neutrino
dark matter would be hot and so does not work well by itself in
computer simulations of the observed large-scale structure. Another
class of phenomena from particle physics, called cosmic strings
or textures, can be added to act as seeds for cosmic structure,
or some cold dark matter (e.g., axions) can be added to make the
results look more like the observations. 
<P>
The most likely dark matter candidates from particle theory are
added to a mix of ordinary matter and thermal radiation in a gigantic
computer model that simulates the complex physics of an expanding
universe that contains collapsing clumps of matter. These simulations
are complex and difficult to do. The goal is to find a set of
parameters and values that produces a simulation with clumps that
have a large-scale structure much like that seen by astronomers.
Another approach to identifying the dark matter particles is to
search for them directly with techniques drawn from experimental
particle physics.
<H4><A NAME="Wimps">WIMPs</A> </H4>

<P>
There are good theoretical and experimental reasons to suspect
that a new symmetry exists in nature, known as supersymmetry,
which might enable gravity to be unified with the weak, electromagnetic,
and strong forces. If supersymmetry exists, then every fundamental
particle of ordinary matter and radiation has a supersymmetric
partner particle, as yet undetected. The lightest supersymmetric
particle cannot decay (because there are no lighter particles
to decay into) and would therefore have survived from the time
of the early universe until now. Such a particle's interactions
with ordinary matter would be very weak, and current accelerator
experiments tell us that the mass of the lightest supersymmetric
particle is greater than 20 GeV (billion electron-volts; the mass
of the proton is about 1&nbsp;GeV)--massive for an elementary
particle. Thus WIMPs make an ideal candidate for non-baryonic
dark matter in the universe. They are imagined to be only weakly
associated with luminous matter, for example, forming a loosely
bound halo around our galaxy and others.
<P>
Laboratory detectors are now under construction in several countries
to look for a flux of WIMPs with mass in the range from 5 to 100
GeV. Early results from conventional detectors have already set
useful limits on the flux of WIMPs, and new efforts are starting
based on entirely new cryogenic detectors. If WIMPs form a halo
around our galaxy, then they constantly bombard Earth, but only
rarely would a WIMP interact with an atom. Searches for WIMPs
are conducted by measuring the recoil energy expected from the
occasional collision between a WIMP and the nucleus of an atom
in the detector. The experiments are extraordinarily difficult
because the expected event rate for WIMP interactions is very
low, somewhere between 0.001 to 1 event per kilogram of detector
per day. Furthermore, the energy deposited in the detector for
each event is small. However, the biggest problem in these experiments
is the confusion generated by similar signals coming from natural
radioactivity and cosmic rays. The experiments are therefore conducted
deep underground to greatly reduce the cosmic ray flux and use
extremely pure materials to minimize radioactive contamination.
Like all direct searches for dark matter, these are high-risk
experiments because of their technological challenges and because
of the absence of precise predictions for the mass and the behavior
of the WIMP candidates. But they are also experiments with potentially
huge payoffs--understanding the missing mass and opening a new
chapter in particle physics.
<H4><A NAME="Axions">Axions</A> </H4>

<P>
The axion is an unusual particle whose existence has been postulated
for reasons related to charge-parity (CP) conservation, a symmetry
of the strong interaction in elementary-particle physics. If axions
actually exist, they do not behave like most particles, which
move independently and randomly with different directions and
energies. Instead, axions are expected to move coherently, behaving
more like a slowly moving sea of particles. Theory allows only
a narrow range of possible masses for the axion, near 10<SUP>-5</SUP>
eV--the opposite extreme from the possible mass for WIMPs. Nevertheless,
if the axion exists with this mass, its total cosmological mass
density could still dominate the universe. 
<P>
Dark matter axions could be detected based on the prediction that
axions can change into photons in a strong magnetic field. If
tuned to the proper frequency, a microwave cavity embedded in
a strong magnetic field appears to spontaneously produce electromagnetic
energy, or photons. Axion-induced oscillations would occur only
in a narrow frequency range. By tuning the cavity to different
frequencies a range of possible axion masses could be scanned.
Two prototype detectors have been built, and results from these
experiments are expected in the next few years. If the axion is
detected, it will be a triumph of experimental ingenuity and the
verification of a remarkable theoretical concept. 
<H4><A NAME="Neutrinos">Neutrinos</A> </H4>

<P>
In the early universe, neutrinos were as abundant as any other
particle species. Although neutrinos ceased to interact significantly
with other matter when the universe was only 1 second old, they
have not disappeared, and today neutrinos are believed to make
up a background sea of radiation similar to the CMBR. Because
neutrinos are so abundant (100 per cubic centimeter, on average),
they would dominate the mass density of the universe if they had
even a little mass. Neutrino masses can be probed by accelerator
experiments looking for one species of neutrino spontaneously
changing into another species. The rate of transformation depends
on the difference in mass between the species. Sensitive experiments
of this sort are under way at the Fermi, Brookhaven, and Los Alamos
national laboratories, and at CERN.
<P>
There is also an astrophysical method for measuring the masses
of neutrinos. When a massive star explodes as a supernova, 99&nbsp;percent
of its energy is carried away by neutrinos. The neutrinos are
predicted to be emitted in a brief, intense pulse. Measuring the
amount that the pulse has spread out when it arrives at Earth
allows estimation of limits on the masses of the neutrinos. This
method was pioneered by two underground experiments that detected
the neutrino pulse from the 1987 supernova in the Large Magellanic
Cloud. A supernova in our own galaxy could provide enough data
to make a much better measurement of neutrino mass if detectors
were operating when it occurred. A future supernova closer to
Earth might yield a sufficient flux of neutrinos of all species,
so that estimates or improved limits on the masses of different
species of neutrinos could be inferred. It is important that the
detectors be ready when the next supernova in the Milky Way occurs,
given that the previous one was recorded 400 years ago, and opportunities
for observing such events occur only rarely. 
<H3><A NAME="SotSotEU">Summary of the Study of the Early Universe</A>
</H3>

<P>
The success of the Big Bang theory of nucleosynthesis gives reason
to hope that particle physicists and cosmologists can reach even
farther back into the early universe with theories and experiments.
The key tasks are to extend our knowledge of physics at the highest
energies and to find self-consistent explanations of all of the
phenomena astronomers see in the universe today. The abundances
of the light elements, CMBR fluctuations, the composition and
structure of matter, and the homogeneity and geometry of today's
universe are examples of observable phenomena that have roots
in the early universe. To study these and other relics of the
Big Bang, astronomers and physicists use traditional optical and
radio telescopes and particle accelerators. A wide variety of
special-purpose instruments are also in use, such as underground
dark matter detectors and small microwave radiometers on balloons
and at the South Pole. The essential strategy comes mostly from
theorists working at the boundary of particle physics, nuclear
physics, and astrophysics-in the emerging field of particle astrophysics.
<P>
In the past decade much common ground has been found between the
physics of the very small (elementary particles) and the physics
of the very large (cosmology). The early universe offers the particle
theorist the ultimate laboratory for testing exotic theories of
unification and high-energy phenomena. The concepts of particle
theory offer the cosmologist physical explanations for the origins
of otherwise mysterious phenomena such as the fine-tuning problem
(<FONT FACE="Symbol">W</FONT> <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#187;</FONT>
1), the source of the fluctuations that gave rise to large-scale
structure in the universe, and the nature of the dark matter.
Identification of the missing dark matter and the testing of the
concept of inflation are the major challenges ahead.<BR>
