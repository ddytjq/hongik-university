        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i>Non-life shows substantial growth with 500,000 new motor policies sold </i> <br>  <br> Products driven by modernised with-profits investments supported Co-operative Insurance Society's (CIS's) long-term business in a year of difficult investment conditions, according to CIS's annual report released today. Total premium income for the Society remained stable at almost £2 billion (see appendix 1) which comprised £1.36 billion for life business and £599 million for non-life business. <br>  <br> Sales of CIS's with-profits bond increased by 18% and attracted new investment of £485 million, its market-leading life ISA increased by 42% and over 50% of stakeholder pensions sales were in CIS's innovative with profits option. <br>  <br> CIS's non-life business had another exceptional year with premium income increasing by 31%, particularly in motor insurance where CIS now insures more than 1.3 million cars, a 27% increase on 2001. <br>  <br> From this year onwards CIS's accounts are being consolidated within those of the Co-operative Group, reflecting the closer working within the family of businesses,which includes Co-op Group Retail, Travelcare and The Co-operative Bank. <br>  <br> As part of its commitment to full business reporting CIS has also included an operational and financial review of the social, ethical and environmental risks that it is facing. This is in line with the objectives of the company law review, which says that private companies should be required to publish such a review in their annual reports. <br>  <br> Social performance for the Society was also strong this year, with CIS meeting all 35 targets set out in its social report, which measures a range of activities including speed of customer service, energy consumption and diversity in the workplace. (see appendix 2) CIS has now set itself a manifesto for 2002 - 2003, with a new set of stretching social and environmental targets. (see appendix 3) <br>  <br> CIS General Manager (Marketing), Martin Clarke, said: <br> "In a challenging marketplace it is important that we take a holistic view of the business and the environment in which we operate. <br> "A combination of competitive products, appropriate use of technology, expanding distribution capability and our socially responsible approach to business leaves CIS well placed to meet the challenges which lie ahead, both in the long term savings and general insurance markets." <br> <br>  <br> For more information contact: Russ Brady, CIS Press Office 0161 837 5672 <br>  <br> John Paul Maytum, CIS Press Office 0161 837 4099 <br>  <br> Carolyn Hicks, CIS Press Office 0161 837 4912 <br>  <br>   <b>Notes to Editors</b> <br>    <br> Customers wanting information about CIS's products and services should call the CIS Service Centre free on 08457 464646 <br> An ISDN line is available for broadcast interviews <br>  <br> APPENDIX 1: <br>  <br> <table width="500" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
