The spinal cord:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Although we usually study the spinal cord as a seriesof cross sections, it is important to remember that it is in facta column, with continuous tracts and cell columns.  However, thecord can be divided into segments by the nerve roots that comeoff of it; although the rootlets branch off nearly continuously,they coalesce into about 31 discrete nerves along the cord (8cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, and 1 coccygeal nerves).  At eachsegment, rootlets appear to come out of both the dorsal and ventralhalves of the spinal cord, as you see here:<BR></FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="spinal1.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">In fact, only the ventral roots are coming out ofthe cord - the dorsal roots are actually going in.  Throughoutthe cord, the dorsal grey matter (<B>dorsal horns</B>) deals withsensory perception, and receives information from the peripherythrough the dorsal root.  The <B>ventral horns</B> contain the</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Symbol">a</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">-motorneurons</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">, whose axons exit the cord viathe ventral roots and travel directly to the muscles.  </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Along the dorsal root is a collection of cell bodiescalled the <B>dorsal root ganglion</B>.  Inside the ganglion arethe cell bodies of all the receptor neurons that send processesout to the periphery.  The free nerve ending in the tip of yourfinger that feels the paper cut actually has its cell body backin the dorsal root ganglion.  As you can see from the picture,the dorsal root ganglion is actually located ventrally, but youcan tell that it is part of the dorsal root.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>B.  Levels of the spinal cord:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">By this time in the course you have probably noticedthat different levels of the cord are different in shape.  Couldyou identify the source of a section if you had nothing to compareit to?  In general, you should be able to differentiate cervicalfrom thoracic from lumbar from sacral.  Here is a series of crosssections:<BR></FONT><CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD WIDTH=252><CENTER><IMG SRC="spinal2.gif"></CENTER></TD><TD WIDTH=252><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The first thing to notice is overall <U>shape</U>.  Cervical sections tend to be wide and squashed looking, like an oval.  Compare the cervical section to the round lumbar section.  </FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The second thing to check for is a <U>ventral horn enlargement</U>.  At segments that control a limb, the motor neurons are large and numerous.  This causes enlarged ventral horns in two places: the lower cervical sections (C5-C8) and the lumbar/sacral sections.  If you see an enlargement, you just need to differentiate cervical from lumbar.  This can be done by shape (see above) or by <U>proportion of white matter</U>.</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The amount of white matter relative to grey matter decreases as you move down the cord.  This is logical - in the white matter of the cervical cord you have all of the axons going to or from the entire body, more or less.  In sacral cord the white matter contains only</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=2 WIDTH=504><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">those axons going to or from the last couple of dermatomes - all other axons have &quot;gotten off&quot; at higher levels.  This is why sacral cord looks like it has so much grey matter - really it has just lost all of the white.  <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">So, in summary, here are the level cues so far:  wide flat cord, lots of white matter, ventral horn enlargements = cervical.   Round cord, ventral horn enlargements = lumbar.   Small round cord, almost no white matter = sacral.  And the remaining level, thoracic, is the easiest of all. Notice the pointed tips which stick out between the small dorsal and ventral horns.  This extra cell column is called the intermediate horn, or the <B>intermediolateral cell column</B>.  It is the source of all of the sympathetics in the body, and occurs only in thoracic sections.  </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>C.  Muscle spindles and the myotaticreflex:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">One of the most familiar reflexes is the <B>stretchreflex</B>, also known as the knee-jerk reflex and the <B>myotaticreflex</B>.  In its simplest form it is a 2-neuron loop, one <B>afferent</B>neuron and one <B>efferent</B> neuron.  The afferent neuron isconnected to a <B>muscle spindle</B>, which detects stretch inthe muscle.  The efferent neuron is the motor neuron, which causesthe muscle to twitch.  </FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="spinal3.gif"></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">But there are actually several types of afferentsreporting on the status of the muscle.  Let's look more closelyat the muscle spindle:</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">The muscle spindle is a small group of muscle fiberswalled off from the rest of the muscle by a collagen sheath. The sheath has a spindle or &quot;fusiform&quot; shape, so thesefibers are called <B>intrafusal fibers</B>, and are contrastedwith the extrafusal fibers, which are the power-generating musclefibers.  There are two types of nerve endings wrapped around thisintrafusal fiber, both of which monitor its degree of stretch- as the muscle stretches, so does this capsule within it.  Thesetwo <B>stretch receptors</B> are sensitive to different time scales,however.  The first is called a <B>Ia</B> (that's one-A) fiber;the classification scheme is based on diameter and conductionvelocity, so the Ia's are the largest and fastest.  The Ia fiberfires like crazy when the muscle is stretching, but it is <B>rapidlyadapting</B>.  As soon as the muscle stops changing length, andholds a new position, the Ia adapts to the new length and stopsfiring.  But you also need to know the position of your musclewhen it is still.  The second type of stretch receptor is calleda II fiber, and it is slowly adapting.  It also responds whenthe muscle is stretching, but it maintains a firing rate afterthe muscle has stopped moving (essentially, it is non-adapting). This information is part of what allows you to tell the positionof your arm when your eyes are closed.  <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Rule of nomenclature - if there is a Ia, where isIb?  The <B>Ib</B> fibers are not connected to muscle spindlesat all.  Instead they are embedded in the tendon, and monitoroverall muscle tension from there.  They are also called <B>Golgitendon organs</B> (the word &quot;Golgi&quot; is littered throughoutneuroanatomy - he was a famous early anatomist).  <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Now, there is a potential problem with the musclespindle system which may have occurred to you.  What happens whenthe muscle gets shorter?  Does the spindle go limp and slack? How can it remain sensitive to stretch at short lengths?  Thisis where the intrafusal fiber comes into play.  Like any musclefiber, it can contract.  When it contracts, the entire spindleshortens, remaining taut, and the sensitivity is intact.  Thereare small motor neurons in the ventral horn that innervate theintrafusal muscle fibers and cause them to contract - they arethe </FONT><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Symbol">g</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">-motorneurons</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">.  These neurons are excited everytime the </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Symbol">a</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">-motorneurons fire, so that as the muscle contracts, the intrafusalscontract with it.  <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">How are they all hooked together?  There are twosimple rules:  <U>1) When the stretch receptors fire, the </U></FONT><U><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Symbol">a</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">-motorneuron is excited, and the muscle contracts.  </FONT></U><P><U><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">2) When the Golgi tendon organ fires, the </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Symbol">a</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">-motorneuron is inhibited (via an inhibitory interneuron), and the musclerelaxes.</FONT></U><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">  The purpose here is that thestretch receptors tell the muscle when it needs a little moreforce - that despite intending to contract the muscle is lengthening. This helps you to maintain the correct muscle tone.  The Golgitendon organs, on the other hand, begin to fire when the tensionon the tendon is so great that you are in danger of injury.  Theyhave a protective function, and therefore they tell the muscleto ease off before it tears.  </FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="spinal4.gif"></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Occasionally, especially in cases of pyramidal tractdamage, these two systems can get stuck in a loop, where theyalternately trigger each other, causing the muscle to contract-relax-contract-relax,several times a second.  This rapid trembling is called <B>clonus</B>,and can be a sign of pathology or extreme muscle fatigue.<BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>D.  Multiple motor pathways in thecord:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">There are several pathways which innervate the </FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Symbol">a</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">-motorneurons.  They can be roughly grouped into the <B>voluntary</B>motion pathways and the <B>postural</B> pathways.  The voluntarypathways include the <B>lateral</B> and <B>anterior corticospinal</B>systems, as covered in the &quot;Basic motor&quot; section.  Thepostural pathways do not originate in cortex; instead their functionis to maintain an upright posture against gravity, a task whichrequires hundreds of little muscular adjustments that we are notaware of.   There are three principal pathways in humans: the<B>vestibulospinal</B>, <B>tectospinal</B>, and <B>reticulospinal</B>pathways.  Pathways are always named beginning-to-end, so theseoriginate in the vestibular nuclei, tectum (superior colliculi),and reticular formation, respectively.  The <B>rubrospinal</B>system (from the red nucleus) is also sometimes included, butin humans it may be insignificant.  </FONT><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="spinal5.gif"><BR></CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Although these pathways do not originate in cortex,they are controlled to some degree by cortical structures.  Youmust be able to turn off selective postural systems to accomplishother movements.  This becomes apparent when the cortex is damagedor cut off from the postural pathways, and can no longer controlthem.  If the cortical input is damaged close to its source, (i.e.,in the internal capsule), the result is what is called a <B>decorticate</B>posture.  Here the postural pathways flex the upper limbs andextend the lower limbs by default, since they are getting no inputfrom cortex.  <BR></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">If the damage cuts off not just cortical input butall input from the entire cerebrum, such as with a massive brainsteminjury, the result is a <B>decerebrate</B> posture.  In the decerebrateposition all four limbs are extended and somewhat turned in (pronated). This sort of injury is much more serious than an injury of theinternal capsule; the prognosis is usually very poor.  <BR></FONT><P><B><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino" COLOR=#CC00CC>E.  Injury to the corticospinaltract:</FONT></B><P><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Palatino">Just as the postural pathways have a &quot;mind oftheir own&quot; when cortical control is cut off, the spine canalso produce some weird behaviors when the corticospinal tractis damaged.  All of the spinal reflexes are local - all of thecells involved are contained within one or two segments, and cortexis not necessary.  Therefore reflexes would still be present ina transected spinal cord.  However, the cortex normally keepsa tight rein on reflexive behavior, so that it doesn't interferewith normal movements.  When the cortex is cut off, the spinalcord becomes <B>hyperreflexic</B>.  All of the normal reflexesbecome exaggerated, and some new ones appear.  For example, strokingthe lateral sole of your foot with a sharp object would normallymake your toes curl downward.  In a patient with corticospinaldamage (also called upper motor neuron damage), the big toe wouldlift up and the toes would fan out.  This is called the <B>Babinskisign</B>, and it is <U>always pathological</U> (with the exceptionof very young infants).<BR><BR></FONT><B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=#0000FF FACE="Palatino"><A HREF="http://thalamus.wustl.edu/course">RETURN TO HOME PAGE</A><BR></FONT></B></BODY></HTML>
