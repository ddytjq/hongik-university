&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For starters, I suppose "Jobs" is a little misleading, and I'm sorry about that, because we can't actually pay anyone who helps with this site.  However, if anyone out there would like to help out with this site, e-mail your r&eacute;sum&eacute; to <A href="mailto:jobs@exploretheuniverse.net">jobs@exploretheuniverse.net</A>.  It doesn't have to be very formal, just a list of you skills, knowledges, and any past experiences in astronomy will do.  You don't have to know much about operating websites, because we can teach you what you need to know in that area.  We have enough good web developers, but can use more people to help out with the astronomy side of the page.  Anyone who thinks they can add to our wealth of information is welcome.  You will, of course, get a free e-mail account located here (yourname@exploretheuniverse.net), and the ability to moderate the discussion forums if we ever get those up and running.  In particular, we could use someone who knows about the night sky, using telescopes, locating things with them, etc...
