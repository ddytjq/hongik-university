<span class="textbd">STARCHILDREN - The Future of Astronomy
</span>
<span class="text">
<br>
</p>
<p>
One of the many things I have noticed about our
STARCHILDREN, is that they have brought with them into
this life, so many talents from which they bank 
to employ their love of Astronomy. These youngsters
are so dedicated to this science, it makes me happy to
realise our Universe will indeed be safe in their
hands when it comes time for them to take our place. 
As you read the following interviews with these
STARCHILDREN, please bear in 
mind, they are still young teenagers! 
</p>
<p> 
<b>STARCHILD: Ryan M. Hannahoe - AKA - Mr. Youth in Astronomy</b>
</p>
<p>
Ryan M. Hannahoe is a 16-year-old sophomore at
 Schuylkill Valley High School and is currently a
  member of seven astronomical organisations. He is
 also the President and Founder of the Schuylkill
 Valley Youth Astronomers. Ryan is the Astronomical
 League's Youth Activities Committee Chairperson.
  (<a href="http://www.astroleague.org" class="nav2">www.astroleague.org</a>) 
  His impressive resume includes over 110 volunteer
 lectures across the United States in the past three
 years. He has attended the Pennsylvania State
 University's Aerospace Camp and the University of
 Arizona's Advanced Astronomy Camp.
 
 <a href="http://ethel.as.arizona.edu/astro_camp/teencamp.html" class="nav2">ethel.as.arizona.edu/astro_camp/teencamp.html</a>
 </p>
 <p>
 Ryan has won numerous awards, including, but not by
 any means, limited to : The Horkheimer Award, first
 and second place,
(<a href="http://www.astroleague.org/al/awards/horkhmr/horkhmrs.html" class="nav2">www.astroleague.org/al/awards/horkhmr/horkhmrs.html</a>),
 and first place at Stellafane. (See his extensive
 resume on his website!) Ryan says he got involved
with
 telescope making after seeing the movie: October Sky.
 In addition, Ryan does astro photography, having
 several of his CCD images published in astronomy
 magazines and newspapers.
  Working to preserve dark skies, he has met with
 elected officials, including US Congressmen, to
 discuss how to resolve the problems of light
 pollution, and has dedicated much of his valuable
 time to fundraising for this important cause.
  More on Ryan's dedication to Astronomy can be
 accessed on his website: <a href="http://www.youthinastronomy.org" class="nav2">www.youthinastronomy.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Ryan, I hear you have visited quite a few observatories. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">RH:</span><br>
Yes, just recently I was awarded time on the
 Mt. Evans Observatory in Colorado. I have also
visited
  and/or observed at Kitt Peak, Chamberlain, Schupmann
 /McGregor, Mt. Lemmon, Steward, Mt. Bigelow, Mauna
 Kea, and several others.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
You are also a prolific writer on Astronomy,
 as well. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">RH:</span><br> 
Yes, I have at least 50 articles, some of them
 featured in Sky and Telescope, Astronomy, Optical
  Engineering and  other national magazines,
 including The Reflector - the AL Newsletter.
 <a href="http://www.astroleague.org" class="nav2">www.astroleague.org</a>
 At this time I am writing a book titled: The Sky's the Limit. It will be the Astronomical League's
guide
 book for involving Youth in Astronomy. It should be
 out in September 2002. Mrs. Amelia Goldberg, of the
 Astronomy League is also contributing to this
 important publication.  
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
So what will you be doing this summer, Ryan? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">RH:</span><br>
I actually will be quite busy this summer,
 since I will attend the University of Arizona's
Advanced  Astronomy Camp in AZ., ALCON in UT.,Mt.
Evans in Co., Washington DC, Seattle WA, Hawaii, and
several other places. On June 25, 2002 at 230 p.m., I
will be featured on Mr. David Levy's radio talk show
 (<a href="http://www.letstalkstars.com" class="nav2">www.letstalkstars.com</a>) and will be discussing my
 new project "The Student Telescope Network".

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br> 
Ryan, this is a very impressive and important
 project for youth in astronomy. How did you come up
 with this idea?

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">RH:</span><br>
I am very excited about the student telescope network. It will bring telescopes to the
classroom and
 to every high school age youth with internet access
and capabilities. This valuable youth program was the
 idea of Dr Robert Stencel of the University of Denver
 Astronomy Program, and myself.


</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br> 
So the STN's goal is to make telescopes
 available to every student in every high school in
the
 world. Totally awesome!

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">RH:</span><br>
I must also mention that the STN is made
 possible with the cooperation of the Youth Activities
 Committee of the Astronomical League, the University
 of Denver Astronomy Program, New Mexico Skies, and
Software Bisque. It is revolutionary in style and
manner, and will be a fabulous tool for all high
school age youth interested in the field of astronomy.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
More information on this very important Youth
 Project can be found here:

<br>
Along with all he does to benefit youth and
 astronomy, Ryan is also involved with fundraising
  for Easter Seals, Boy Scouts, Church groups and the
 SVHS Varsity Football Team.  
Ryan's parents, Jeffery and Cheryl support and
encourage their son to succeed in everything he does.
Ryan also has an older brother, John, whom he says is
a "record-breaking golfer". We wish this talented
family success in everything they do.<br>

<span class="textbd">Young and Talented Mr. (Dark Sky Advocate) Jonathan
Casselman: <br>
</span><br>
"Astronomy lifts me up above the troubles of this
world and focuses my eyes on heavenly things. The
abundant beauty of our universe is a wonderful 
source of enjoyment. Through the optics of a
telescope, one can see thousands upon thousands of
objects. When you realize that they're 
incomparable in size and distance to anything else we
come in contact with in our daily lives, it becomes a
very awe-inspiring experience, putting our place in
the cosmos in true perspective!" - Jonathan Casselman 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Jonathan, tell me about your involvement with IDA.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">JC:</span><br> 
As Chairman for the International Dark-Sky
Association's Youth Working Group, I am assembling a
Youth IDA-Team; recruiting youth from across North 
America and adult mentors from the major sectors of
Astronomy.  For this purpose, I'm developing a youht forum web site, 
<a href="http://www.saveourstarryskies.homestead.com" class="nav2">www.saveourstarryskies.homestead.com</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Our goal is to bring universal awareness to the
needless loss of our night skies, emphasizing that we
can eliminate light pollution by utilizing 
full-cutoff, motion-sensor, and reduced outdoor
lighting. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br> 
Jonathan,did you receive much interference you got
from those in your area 
before you were successful in getting the lighting
company to even consider 
the 'option' or "Sky Caps"? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">JC:</span><br>
Of course there was the initial resistance to change
by certain factions. 
Much to their credit however, our power company has
acted as a partner with 
me in programs and suggestions that save energy; with
the Hubbell SkyCap 
Project being no exception.  It is a real pleasure
working with them and I feel like we are on the same
team. We have developed a program where anyone with an
Inland Power yardlight, who purchases a SkyCap, can
have it installed free of charge!  This greatly 
simplifies the upgrading of these lights and
encourages costumers to take a proactive role in
preserving our night skies. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
And you were telling me about your Dark-Sky
Preservation Project-this indeed sounds interesting!  
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">JC:</span><br>
Presently, the focus of my Dark Sky Preservation
Project has been directed 
towards establishing the IDA Youth Working Group. 
However, I have experienced several recent advances in
the local arena. 
</p>
<p>
One example:  Our nearby neighbour, who operated an
antiquated 175 Watt Mercury Vapor yardlight which
could not be upgraded with the Hubble SkyCap, moved. 
Through a positive contact with the real estate agent,
I was able to connect with the new owners; the ensuing
friendship resulted in the yardlight being
disconnected. The results are eliminated glare and
light trespass, perfect for our neighborhood star
parties! 

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
What other awards and prizes have you won besides the
observing awards? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">JC:</span><br>
As recipient of the National "Youth In Astronomy"
Survey Award, the Youth Activities Committee requested
that I be present at the 2001 Astronomical 
League Convention in Washington, DC this past summer,
July 24-29.  As a result, my winning survey was the
featured presentation in the "Youth In 
Astronomy" program at ALCON 2001. 
</p>
<p>
Upon completing the Arp Peculiar Galaxies, my 10th
A.L. Observing Program, the Astronomical League
notified me that I was eligible for the very first 
Master Observers Award.  They were understandably
excited because no one imagined that a youth would
qualify before seasoned adult observers. 
</p>
<p>
At the Awards Banquet, Astronomical League Master
Observer's Award Coordinator Mike Benson shared a
moving testimony of how, against all odds, 
I became the first astronomer in Astronomical League
history and the youngest to achieve the Master
Observer's Award. Thanking Mike, I testified that
youth are the future of amateur astronomy. 
By preparing them to carry on the torch, we are
ensuring Astronomy will continue to bless future
generations with its multitude of celestial sights. 
Thanks to the abundant generosity of family and
friends and the Spokane Astronomical Society's
wonderful members, I was able to attend the 2001 
Astronomical League Convention in Frederick, Maryland
and take an active role there in solidifying support
for youth activities in Astronomy and in 
night sky preservation! 
<a href="http://www.spokaneastronomical.org/" class="nav2">www.spokaneastronomical.org</a>
</p>
<p>
(Horkheimer, for instance - that is a great honour!) 
</p>
<p>
Thanks to the generosity of Jack Horkheimer, it was. 
Submitting my testimony on how the beauty and
inspiration of the heavens was instrumental in my
achievements, I detailed my work in promoting the 
excellence of the Astronomical League Observing
Programs and the imperative of preserving our starry
skies! 
</p>
<p>
At the Awards Banquet, Saturday evening, July 28th, I
became the recipient of the 2001 "Horkheimer Award for
Exceptional Service by a Young Astronomer" 
2nd Place. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Let's talk about Stargaze - tell me about your
involvement this year and in 
years past. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">JC:</span><br>
StarGaze is a highly publicized annual outreach where
members of the Spokane Astronomical Society set up
their telescopes for public viewing of the 
cosmos. 
</p>
<p>
It was at StarGaze 2000, with more than a thousand
people in attendance, that I was able to show Clavius
and its craterlets at nearly 600 power through my 9
1/4" Schmidt-Cassegrain to more than 50 visitors. 
Unarguably, the main attraction that night was viewing
through the 41.2" Hercules telescope.  This behemoth
rewarded the attendees with outstanding views of
Saturn's intricate disk detail, its' delicate ring
system and visible moons! 
</p>
<p>
This past year, I was privileged to conduct a 2001
Branch Outreach for the Spokane Valley Area. 
Following a multimedia educational astronomy program,
we adjourned to the telescopes.  From the complexity
of our universe and how we can preserve our view of
it, to the beauty of the crescent Moon and the
sparkling globular cluster M13, I believe Astronomy
came alive for our 50 plus visitors, many of whom were
young people!  Although we didn't match the attendance
of the main event, that night we reached a previously
untouched audience! 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Have you encountered any set backs from being
homeschooled? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">JC:</span><br>
Quite to the contrary, as a gifted and honors student
homeschooling with the Moore Academy, I have found an
educational venue tailor-made for me! 
Using the "Moore Formula", I have made Astronomy my
core curriculum for the last 5 years.  The resulting
freedom has allowed me to "...go where no man 
has gone before..." becoming the youngest person to
have completed the Herschel 400's in June of 2000 and
the first observer to qualify for and subsequently
receive the  Master Observers Award, setting
Astronomical League world records in both instances. 

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
As a gifted and talented young man, and a definite
'hands-on' type of guy, what, if any drawbacks have
you encountered because of your young age?  Tell me
about being involved in not only science, but
astronomy, for instance, a field where there are many
talented men and women of advanced age and education-
how have they accepted you and your ideas? 
</p>
<p>

<span class="textbd">JC:</span><br>
Although for some it has been difficult to accept the
achievements of a youth, it has been my personal and
pleasant experience that the more talented the
man/woman, the more advanced their age, education, and
</p>
<p>
achievements, the more encouraging and supportive has
been their affirmation. 
</p>
<p>
For instance, talented men such as Barry Beaman, Past
President of the Astronomical League; J. Kelly Beatty,
Senior Editor of Sky & Telescope; Dr. Don Parker,
Associate Director of the A.L.P.O.; Astronaut Story
Musgrave; Chuck Allen III, President of the A.L.; and
men of advanced age such as Dr. Walter Haas, Founder
and Director Emeritus of the A.L.P.O.; affirm a young 
man who is reaching for the stars. 
</p>
<p>
Dynamic women such as Susan Rose, Caldwell Award
Coordinator and president of Amateur Observers Society
of New York; Kathy Machin, President/Kansas 
City Astronomical Society; and Amelia Goldberg,
Universe Sampler Club Coordinator; encourage this
enthusiastic young astronomer. 
</p>
<p>
Men of advanced education such as Dr. Richard Schmude,
Professor of Astronomy/Chemistry, A.L.P.O. Remote
Planets Coordinator; Dr. David Crawford, Astronomer
Emeritus/NOAO, Co-Founder and Executive Director of
the International Dark-Sky Association; and the
talented Mike Benson, Astronomical League SERAL
Chairman and Coordinator for the Master Observers, 
Arp Peculiar Galaxy, Double Star, Urban, and Binocular
Observing Programs; demonstrate their belief in me
through personal mentoring. 

</p>
<p>

<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Have you met any other STARCHILDREN along the way -
maybe with whom you have traded observing secrets and
tips? 

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">JC:</span><br>
The Horkheimer Award Prize has made possible a dream
of mine...to develop StarChildren...along the way! 
To enable the Spokane Astronomical Society's young
astronomers to "reach for the stars", I had the
enjoyment of donating my Horkheimer Award Prize, a 6" 
Bushnell Dobsonian Reflector.  By teaming up with
other generous members, a complete observing system
was handed over to the Young Amateur Astronomers! 
In "giving back" I have found my greatest joy. 

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
In addition to those above-mentioned, who are your 'Mentors and Aides'? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">JC:</span><br>
As a kindred spirit, Telescope Designer/Innovator Jim
Burr, of JMI fame, was the inspiration during my
formative years (14-16 yrs of age) in Astronomy. 
The marvel of the cosmos, and the wonder of its
complexity and immensity, have come alive for me on
his dynamic television programs on the Universe, 
igniting the "fire in my bones"!  Our ongoing
camaraderie is spawning a collaborative effort in
laying the groundwork for a worldwide "Astronomy 
Alive" satellite series. 
</p>
<p>
My dynamic educational counselor, Mrs. Helen Williams,
in cooperation with the grandfather of the
home-schooling movement, Dr. Raymond Moore; has 
worked diligently to develop an educational regimen
customized for my future in astronomy, earning a
special place in my heart! 
</p>
<p>
The humble and gracious Professor Richard Schmude,
through his steadfast assistance with our Titan
research project, has established a standard in 
personal educational mentoring! 
</p>
<p>
Astronomer Emeritus at the Kitt Peak National
Observatory and Co-Founder/Executive Director of the
International Dark-Sky Association, Dr. Dave Crawford,
continues to amaze me with his generosity; all in all,
exemplifying a life of service to the astronomical
community! 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
To whom do you "owe it all"? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">JC:</span><br>
Without question, to my dedicated mother and father!!!
</p>
<p>
As the only child of older parents, brought up in a
beautiful isolated country setting, I have had the
privilege of Mom and Dad's abundant affection and
attention, being home-schooled since my birth. 
</p>
<p>
Since her college days, as a chemistry major being
offered an early internship at the Oak Ridge
Laboratories of the Atomic Energy Commission, to the
time when catastrophic illness derailed this dream;
leaving her an invalid to an autoimmune disorder, Mom
has possessed a passion to pass on her love of
knowledge to me! 
</p>
<p>
Some of my earliest memories are of Mom, with
abounding exuberance, explaining the periodic table of
elements, drawing out valence and covalence bonding,
sharing the deep mysteries of E=mc2!  Instead of the
ABC's, Encyclopedia Britannica was my primer. 
</p>
<p>
In her 30-year battle against chronic illness, Mom has
been my "Professor Extraordinaire" and my inspiration!
</p>
<p>
A labourer who works with his hands, my Dad, a
maintenance supervisor, has provided me with a
practical education, being exemplified through our 
home business where no job is ever too humble or too
hard! 
</p>
<p>
My creative and hard working father, teaching me in
the school of poverty and self-denial, has been to me
an exemplary role model of faithfulness and 
sterling courage! 
</p>
<p>
My parents' tireless efforts to support me in my
passion and pursuit of astronomy have been intrinsic
to my accomplishments as a youth!

What Public Speaking engagements have you experiened?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">JC:</span><br>
For the StarGaze 2001 Valley branch event, I commenced
with a 2 hour multimedia educational Astronomy
presentation entitled "Revelation of the Stars" for
the benefit of our visitors, sharing with those in
attendance the basic concepts of Astronomy and
principles of the universe, elaborating on 
the latest discoveries about the cosmos. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Do you have any Published Papers?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">JC:</span><br>
At the present time, I am collaborating with Dr.
Richard Schmude, Astronomy Professor and A.L.P.O.
Remote Planets Coordinator, on publishing a research 
paper studying Saturn's largest moon, Titan.  Through
a series of photometric observations, we intend to
monitor Titan for any brightness fluctuations that may
be indicative of changes in the moon's atmosphere. 
This project comes at a most opportune time, when the
attention of astronomers and scientists worldwide is
focused on the Cassini mission's arrival at Saturn in
2004.  Not only will the mission revolutionize our 
understanding of the ringed planet, but it also
intends to land a probe on the surface of Titan,
giving us our first glimpse of its landscape and data 
on its composition.  This is indeed an exciting time
to be in astronomy!!!

What is your favorite place to 'hang out and observe'?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">JC:</span><br>
Being blessed with a front yard that is a reasonably
dark-sky site about 30 miles northwest of Spokane,
Washington; it is easy to say, "There's no place 
like home!" 
</p>
<p>
However, my favorite place to observe is where I can
share the wonders of the universe with others,
wherever the location! 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
I see you have been appointed "Observing Awards
Coordinator for the Astronomical League's Youth
Activities Committee" - How did you get this 
much coveted and prestigious job? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">JC:</span><br>
Upon becoming the recipient of the "Youth In
Astronomy" Survey Award, I received two appointments
from the Astronomical League.  As the Youth 
Activities Committee Observing Awards Coordinator, I
encourage fellow youth via my youth website, 
<a href="http://www.observetheheavens.homestead.com" class="nav2">www.observetheheavens.homestead.com</a>
to engage themselves in the 16 A.L. "Observe"
Programs. 
</p>
<p>
As the NorthWest Rep. of the Youth Activities
Committee, I challenge and assist high school and
home-schooled youth to establish youth-run Astronomy 
Clubs affiliated with the League.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Do you have any favorite websites you would like to
bring to a Young Astronomer's Attention? 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">JC:</span><br>
Two top sites I would recommend as excellent resources
for the young astronomer are the Astronomical League
Homepage, <a href="www.astroleague.org" class="nav2">www.astroleague.org</a>, and 
the International Dark-Sky Association's Homepage at
<a href="www.darksky.org" class="nav2">www.darksky.org</a>. 
</p>
<p>
For those considering the purchase of a telescope, Ed
Ting's excellent telescope reviews,
<a href="www.scopereviews.com" class="nav2">www.scopereviews.com</a>, 
cut through the advertising hype
and provide firsthand experience with the telescope
that will revolutionize 
your view of the universe!

If you're looking for the cutting edge on Light
Pollution or searching for 
science fair project ideas, Cliff Haas has effectively
compiled a superb online portal for dark skies at 
<a href="http://members.aol.com/ctstarwchr/" class="nav2">members.aol.com/ctstarwchr/</a>! 
Jonathan, in what specific area would you most like to
encourage other young amateur astronomers? 
The Youth IDA-Team is promoting night sky-friendly
outdoor lighting via our website,
<a href="http://www.saveourstarryskies.homestead.com" class="nav2">www.saveourstarryskies.homestead.com</a>.

<span class="textbd">Miss Courtney LeeAnn Hale, Talented 13 year old STARCHILD from Kansas.
 <br>
</span><br>
 Miss Courtney wanted so much to see the plantetarium
 showing on her first visit to Washburn University
 that she missed it! 
 <a href="http://www.washburn.edu/cas/physics/crane/ohsched.htm" class="nav2">www.washburn.edu/cas/physics/crane/ohsched.htm</a>
 (The displays at the planetarium kept her attention
 for too long.)
 Miss Courtney, who is quite an insistant young lady,
and will not take no for an answer, convinced those
 in charge to have another showing exclusively for
her,
 and her younger sister and friend who accompanied
her that very evening. And so it came to be that
 Young Miss Coutney became interested in astronomy
because it was a way to "escape her multiple health
problems" which kept her in hospital when she was a
tiny tot.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">CH:</span><br>
I can still remember when I looked up onto the
ceiling, how excited I was, and how much envy I had
for the people who knew about space.  
After the show I talked to one of the Professors
 about volunteering. He told me to leave a note for
Brenda Culbertson, who is in charge of the planetarium
and
observatory. As I walked home, I hoped so much that
 she would call me.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Well, Miss Courtney's "wish upon a star" came true
 when Ms. Culbertson phoned her the next morning.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">CH:</span><br>
I never dreamed that this would become such a large 
 part of my life.
 Most kids don't even know what a planetarium or
observatory is.  I can tell them more than they ever
 wanted to know.  Volunteering has helped me believe
 in myself and others, by knowing there are things
 beyond just this  small planet.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
  On  28 June 2001, AL Vice President Bob Gent
presented Miss Coutney with the 6th place Year 2000
Horkheimer Award. <a href="http://www.astroleague.org/al/awards/horkhmr/horkhmrs.html" class="nav2">
www.astroleague.org/al/awards/horkhmr/horkhmrs.html</a>
</p>
<p>
 Neither Rain, Sleet nor Snow can keep Miss Courtney
 from her duties at the Observatory. Her "Spicey
Personality" is perfect for controling the frequent
 visitors who sometimes may number in the hundreds on
 Observing Night. She has also learned to run the
 112-year-old telescope. Astronomy is definately "in
the stars" for Young Courtney Hale.

<span class="textbd"> STARCHILD Ariel 
 <br>
</span><br>

She is one of the youngest
astronomers in Topeka, Kansas. She is a friend of
 and works alongside STARCHILD Courtney Hale, 6th
place 2001 Horkheimer Award winner, at Crane
Observatory in Washburn University. 
 </p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">Ariel:</span><br>
 Courtney and I help give tours to Crane
 Observatory and the planetarium. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
 I hear you are a very talented
 young lady and have been working at Washburn since
 the tender age of eight. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">Ariel:</span><br>
I got my volunteer job at Washburn from my
 grandmother who works there. (Ms. Brenda Culbertson)
 I run the projector in the planetarium, which is very
 old, so during the tours we get donations to try to
 fix it. During the planetarium tours, I work the
 dials and switches while my grandmother tells the
group about constellations.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Starchild Ariel made a "glow-in-the dark"
 necklace to wear so her grandmother could find her in
the dark at Starparties.
 Do you go out often to observe, Miss Ariel?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">Ariel:</span><br>
I go out every chance I get, to my
 grandmother's house, because the city has too many
 lights.
  I like to go out on the front porch and sit and
 watch the stars through the binoculars and whenever
my
 grandmother has a star party at her house,
 I like to set up my telescope next to the other's so
 I can look at the night sky, too. I have a very
 small telescope, but would like to get a bigger one
 sometime soon. 

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Ariel received her first desktop
  refractor at the age of four from a teenager who
 had moved on to a larger one. 
 So what do you observe at starparties, Ariel?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">Ariel:</span><br>
I'd have to say that my favorite thing to
 observe is constellations because they have so many
 stories, and it's also fun to connect the dots.
 One of my favorite constellation stories is about
  the winter sky. The sisters are being chased by the
 bull, which is being chased by the hunter and his 
dogs.

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
So are you a future Astronaut, Miss Ariel? Do
 you think you may one day travel into space? Live
 in Space? Work in Space?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">Ariel:</span><br>
I like astronomy as a hobby, but I
 think I want to be a photographer. Maybe I'll take
 pictures of the night sky.

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Ms. Culbertson tells me that her granddaughter
would tell her own stories about the stars and her
 theories on how they came to be, when she was as
 young as four. She has always been an active young
lady, and was winning talent contests at 3, 4 and 5,
she also does comedy routines.  

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">Ariel:</span><br>
At night, I would ask my Grandmother why the
 stars were so "jiggly" in the binoculars and hand
 them to her so she could see the "jiggly" stars and I
 also wanted to know why they were different colors;
and why the Moon was so bright; things like that. We
would talk for hours.

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Ariel's grandmother, Ms. Brenda Culbertson has
 this to say about Ariel: She would look in the
 telescopes and tell US what we were looking at most
 of the time. She could recognize constellations and
  comets when they were around. She could even stay
 up longer than most adults. This year she turned 11.
 She still likes to attend star parties and look at
the
 night sky. 
  </p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">Ariel:</span><br>
Everyone should get involved in
astronomy because it is educational, a fun experience,
and you get to stay up late.

<span class="textbd"> Mr. Steven Wooton aka "Mr. Nebula"
 - Young Ambassador to the Stars
 <br>
</span><br>
Steven Wooton is an eighth grade student from 
 northeast Kansas. He explained to me he got his
  first taste of Astronomy when he was younger and
 his  grandfather would take him out to look at the
Moon.  Every Thursday he goes to "Crane Observatory at
Washburn University to look through the big
telescope".
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
How did you get the name: "Mr. Nebula"?
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">SW:</span><br>
Since I like to look at Nebulae, Ms. Brenda
 started calling me that. Nebulae are fine things to
observe. I also enjoy observing galaxies, star
 clusters, planets, and the Moon."
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
Tell me about Crane Observatory. How did you
 learn about this wonderfully interesting place and
the
  'Big Eye to the Heavens'?

</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">SW:</span><br>
My Mother and Aunt Joyce took me to the
 Planetarium and I enjoyed it so much, I asked to
speak with Ms. Brenda to see if I could help out
there.
 I was overjoyed when she said yes.
</p>
<p>
<span class="textbd">LL:</span><br>
"Mr Ambasador to the Stars" - Steve "Nebula"
 Wooton, is a wonderful example of our responsible
 youth, dedicated to observing the night sky.
