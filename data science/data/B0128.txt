<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>THE SUPER SAVER ACCOUNT<br>
</b><br>
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><b>Premium rates.... for regular savers</b> <u><br>
</u><br>
</font><font size="2">The Super Saver Account offers an attractive interest rate if you
save on a monthly basis and make no withdrawals. It's ideal if you want to build up an
investment for the future such as a deposit for a new home.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><em><b>How much can I invest? </b></em></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">You can choose to invest any amount between £10.00 and £300.00 per
  month. Whichever amount you choose to invest&nbsp; must be your initial deposit, and will
  then become your regular monthly payment.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><strong><em>Can I alter my monthly payment?</em></strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">You can change your monthly payment once a calendar year by providing
  the Society with prior written notification.&nbsp; The revised monthly payment must be
  between £10 and £300.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><b>How much interest do I earn? </b></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">The Super Saver Account pays an excellent rate of interest in return for
  saving on a regular basis. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">You can find out what the current rates are by referring to the Interest
  Rate leaflet available in our branches or by asking a member of staff.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">You can miss one payment in any calendar year, however, if two payments
  are missed the account will be switched to a Cashbuild Instant Access Account. &nbsp;
  Should this occur the account number will remain the same.&nbsp; If you pay by standing
  order this will not be affected.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><em><b>How and when is interest paid?</b></em></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">The society pays interest on your investment from the day after we
  receive the funds, up to and including the day before withdrawal or closure.&nbsp; The
  interest is calculated on the daily balance of your account.&nbsp; Interest will be paid
  into your account, or transferred to another of your accounts, on December 31st each year.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><em><b>How and when can I withdraw my money?</b></em></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">Your money is available without the need to give any notice. However,
  please note that any withdrawal must be to close the account - partial withdrawals are not
  permitted except where the money is being used for a deposit to buy a property and a
  mortgage is taken out with the Society. In this case, the balance in the account can be
  transferred into a new Super Saver Account if you wish to continue to save on a regular
  basis. When a withdrawal is made to close the account, it can be up to £300 in cash and
  larger amounts by cheque at any branch.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><em><b>Are there any other benefits for saving
regularly?</b></em></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">If you are a home buyer, and the account is closed in order to fund the
  deposit for the purchase of a property, you will receive a &quot;Cashback&quot; offer
  equivalent to 2% of the balance in the account at the time of closure up to a maximum of
  £1,000 and a minimum of £100. This amount will be payable on completion of the mortgage.
  Please note that for each mortgage completion only one Super Saver Account will be
  eligible for the &quot;Cashback&quot; offer.<br>
  To qualify for this offer you must take out a mortgage with the Society and the Super
  Saver Account has been in operation for at least 12 months and was closed no more than 12
  months prior to the completion taking place.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><em><b>How do I open an account?</b></em></font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">You can open a Super Saver Account by simply calling in at your local
  branch and filling in an application form. You must hand in or send your money at the same
  time.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">The ideal way to save every month is by standing order from your bank or
  building society account, then you can be sure of building up your savings each month. The
  money you want to invest should leave your account on or before the 21st of every month to
  ensure that we receive it before the end of the calendar month. Please ask our staff for a
  Standing Order form and just fill it in when you open your account. Or, if you prefer, you
  can make monthly payments at your local branch or agent, using your passbook.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2">When you open an account with us we are required by law to check your
  identity. </font></p>

  post, then we will require two original documents from each of the two groups shown below

check with any of our branches or agents. </font></p>

<p><font size="1">Where required by legislation, interest will be paid or credited after
deduction of income tax at the appropriate rate or subject to the required certification,
gross. Where the tax deducted exceeds an investor's tax liability (if any), a claim may be
made to the Inland Revenue for repayment of tax. For individuals whose income falls within
the lower or basic rate bands, the tax deducted will match their liability to tax on the
interest and they will have no more tax to pay on it. Individuals who are liable to tax at
rates above the basic rate bands will have to pay additional tax on the interest to cover
the difference between the tax deducted and the higher rate tax due. </font></p>

<p><font size="1">If you do not have to pay income tax you may fill in form R85 and we
will pay you interest without deduction of tax. Please ask at your local branch for this
form if you need one. If you have any queries on your tax liability you should get in
touch with your Inland Revenue tax office. </font></p>
