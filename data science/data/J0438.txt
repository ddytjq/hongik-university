<h1>Du Page Airport</h1>
<h2>News: 24 April 1997</h2>
<p>
The Du Page Airport project has been dropped; the Motorsports Alliance
is now seeking other sites near Chicago.
</p>
<p>
There is an ongoing effort to build a race track on the
Du Page Airport site just outside of Chicago.
The following press releases were collected by Phillip Gravel,
<a href="mailto:pgravel@Mcs.Net">pgravel@Mcs.Net</a>.
</p>

<h3>Speedway group gets DuPage OK for talks</h3>
<p>
By Dan Rozek<br>
Chicago Sun-Times<br>
</p>
<p>
A consortium that owns four major racetracks, including ones in 
Indianapolis and Daytona, Fla., grabbed the pole position Monday 
in the competition of build a new motor speedway at the DuPage 
Airport.
</p>
<p>
Airport commissioners agreed unanimously to begin negotiating with 
the Motorsports Alliance for a lease option on 750 acres of vacant 
land the racing group has targeted for a $60 million, 1-1/2 mile, 
80,000 seat racetrack.
</p>
<p>
The racing partnership includes the Indianapolis Motor Speedway 
and International Speedway Corp., which owns Daytona International 
Speedway and two other large tracks.  The consortium beat out two 
other groups interested in the West Chicago site.
</p>
<p>
"They have a proven track record of doing this work," board 
chairman Joseph Kindlon said.
</p>
<p>
The decision allows airport officials to negotiate an option with 
Motorsports Alliance for eight to 12 months -- the length of time 
needed for the group to conduct feasibility, environmental and 
noise studies.
</p>
<p>
Though Motorsports officials said they will pay $100,000 for the 
short-term option that will keep the property off the market, both 
sides said construction of a speedway is far from certain.
</p>
<p>
"We're in the preliminary stage but we're excited about moving 
forward in this market" said Lesa D. Kennedy, senior vice 
president of International Speedway Corp.
</p>
<p>
Motorsports officials have proposed holding two major races a year 
-- one stock car event and one Indy car competition.
</p>
<p>
If studies show a track can succeed, airport authorities hope to 
sign a long term-lease that would help finance airport operations, 
which are now tax-supported.
</p>
<p>
West Chicago officials said the racetrack proposal could provide a 
long term source of tax money.
</p>
<p>
Still, West Chicago Mayor Steven Lakics offered no promises the 
track would be welcomed with open arms, saying much depends on 
financial and planning details yet to be negotiated.
</p>
<p>
Motorsports Alliance officials denied they had an inside track, 
although they acknowledged talking to airport officials beginning 
last summer.  The airport put out a request for qualifications 
from racing groups in October.
</p>
<h3>Airport board zips to decision on speedway</h3>
<p>
Chicago Tribune<br>
Tuesday, December 24, 1996<br>
<br>
By William Grady<br>
Tribune Staff Writer
</p>
<p>
A group that includes the owners of two of the higher-profile 
speedways in the U.S. was selected Monday to explore possibly 
bringing the major leagues of auto racing to suburban West 
Chicago.
</p>
<p>
After months of speculation and talk, DuPage Airport Authority 
board members voted to do business with Motorsports Alliance, a 
joint venture that proposes to spend $60 million to $70 million 
building a 1-1/2 mile oval racetrack on several hundred acres of 
airport-owned land south of Roosevelt Road near the DuPage-Kane 
County line.
</p>
<p>
The joint venture includes the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Corp., 
a privately held company that annually hosts one of the world's 
premier auto races, as well as International Speedway Corp., which 
owns Daytona International Speedway in Florida and two other 
tracks.
</p>
<p>
The decision by the airport board does not guarantee a speedway 
will be build in West Chicago.  Rather, it begins a process that 
could lead to racing in DuPage in 1998 or 1999.
</p>
<p>
Airport officials now will attempt to negotiate an agreement that 
essentially would halt temporarily their efforts to develop the 
property and allow time for the Motorsports Alliance to conduct 
the financial and feasibility, traffic and environmental studies 
it needs before deciding whether to begin construction.
</p>
<p>
The studies could take up to a year to complete.
</p>
<p>
West Chicago officials continue to take a cautious approach to the 
racetrack proposal.
</p>
<p>
Mayor Steven Lakics said after the airport board vote that traffic 
and noise remain concerns of residents, though he noted any 
development of the property -- whether for corporate offices or as 
an industrial park -- likely would generate additional traffic.
</p>
<p>
The bottom line, Lakics said, is, "There has to be a financial 
benefit to the community."
</p>
<p>
The Chicago area is one of the largest untapped markets in the 
U.S. for a sport that has been growing in popularity.  NASCAR-
sanctioned stock car racing alone is believed to be a $2 billion-
a-year industry.
</p>
<p>
In Illinois, speedways are under construction or proposed for 
Kankakee, the Quad Cities area and in Downstate Madison across the 
Mississippi River from St. Louis
[the Madison track is the redevelopment of
<a href="Gateway.html">Gateway</a>
by Chris Pook, promotor of the Long Beach GP -- rpw].
</p>
<p>
The airport board's decision to choose the Motorsports Alliance 
was expected.
</p>
<p>
Though there was little discussion at Monday's meeting, board 
members had said publicly and privately they believed the joint 
venture was in the best position financially to develop a 
speedway.  That also was the recommendation of airport staff and 
the board's consultant on development issues.
</p>
<p>
"They [the Motorsports Alliance] have a proven track record of 
doing this sort of thing," said Joseph Kindlon, airport board 
chairman.
</p>
<p>
Two other groups, the DuPage Speedway and Entertainment Complex 
and Tag Sport Ltd., had pitched competing proposals at meetings in 
November and earlier this month.
</p>
<p>
Representatives of both groups voiced dismay at the board's 
decision.
</p>
<p>
DuPage Speedway had sought to make a new presentation on Monday, 
but its principals were delay by fog and rain in the Chicago area.
</p>
<p>
The group included Indy-car team owner Chip Ganassi, also a 
partner in the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball club, and Charles H. 
Gessner Jr., an investment banker in Palm Beach, Fla., with 
expertise in financing sports facilities.
</p>
<p>
John F. Garrow, a Wheaton lawyer represented the group, said he 
thought the board acted too quickly in making its decision.
</p>
<p>
William R. Kautz, a Geneva businessman and partner in Tag Sport 
Ltd., charged that the board had acted irresponsibly throughout 
its decision-making process.
</p>
<p>
In a letter to airport administrator Gordon Cole, Kautz wrote, "We 
believe you and the board have arrogantly underestimated the 
intelligence of the community who have now, for the most part, 
become your opposition."
</p>
<p>
Kautz has vowed to find another site in the western suburbs for 
his proposed European-style race course surrounded by an office 
and industrial park.
</p>
<p>
Airport board members generally had praised Kautz's plan but had 
voiced doubts about the group's financial backing.
</p>
<p>
Officials of Motorsports Alliance noted that the airport's request 
for proposals had asked at this stage more for financial 
background and racetrack expertise of the competing groups rather 
than for detailed drawings of development proposals.
</p>
<p>
"We do in fact run a number of large speedways," said H. Lee 
Combs, senior vice president of operations for International 
Speedway.
</p>
<p>
Combs also promised to help public officials in the area pitch the 
economic and other benefits of a racetrack, which includes 
recognition nationwide for the host community.
</p>
<p>
In addition to Daytona, International Speedway owns the Talladega 
Superspeedway in Alabama and the Darlington Raceway in South 
Carolina and has interests in other tracks.
</p>
<p>
Motorsports Alliance had offered to pay $100,000 to the airport 
for what amounts to an option to lease the property.  Airport 
officials had indicated they may seek more.
</p>
<p>
Other issues expected to be on the table during the next stage of 
negotiations are whether the airport will refund any of the option 
fee if plans for a speedway are dropped, and whether the joint 
venture will pick up the cost of any consultants the airport 
decides to hire.

<h3>Indy group wins DuPage Airport property race</h3>
<p>
By Jeremy Olson<br>
Copley News Service
</p>
<p>
The Motorsports Alliance, a conglomerate of racing organizations 
whose credits include ownership of the Indianapolis and Daytona 
500s, was selected Monday by the DuPage Airport Authority to 
negotiate leasing airport Property on which to build a racetrack.
</p>
<p>
Now a bigger question for looms: Should the Airport Authority 
allow construction of a racetrack on its property at all?
</p>
<p>
The answer will come over the next 12 months, the time in which 
airport and Alliance officials plan to negotiate a lease over 722 
acres of land between Roosevelt Road and Fermilab.
</p>
<p>
"That's what the next eight to 12 months are all about," said 
airport Public relations director Brian Kulpin.  "They have to 
show us this is environmentally and economically feasible."
</p>
<p>
Municipal groups will play a key role as well.  West Chicago 
officials, who will discuss the track at a meeting at 7 p.m. Jan. 
13, will have to rezone that land before a racetrack could be 
built, giving them substantial authority over its development.
</p>
<p>
The alliance proposed construction of a 1.5-mile oval track 
surrounded by grandstands that could hold up to 80,000 people.
</p>
<p>
Optimistically, Alliance executives said the track could hold a 
race in 1998 if they reach a deal with the airport.
</p>
<p>
The alliance consists of the International Speedway Corporation 
(ISC); Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS); and John Menard owner of 
Menard's Inc. and an Indy racing team.
</p>
<p>
Commissioners said they selected the alliance with which to 
negotiate because of its financial stability, exemplified by ISC's 
$80 million stock sale through which it could fund the track.
</p>
<p>
"We are a board that represents taxpayers," said Commissioner Vern 
McCarthy Jr. "We're not in the risk business.  We're not 
commissioned to risk taxpayers' money."
</p>
<p>
Airport officials have stressed this is far from a done deal, 
noting environmental, engineering and traffic studies will need to 
be completed, and public opinion will need to be considered.
</p>
<p>
"A project like this is so community-oriented," agreed Lee Combs, 
ISC senior vice president.  "Clearly, we're going to have to go 
out and test the waters and educate the community."
</p>
<p>
Among the concerns likely to be discussed are:
</p>
<p>
o Race dates:
</p>
<p>
The potential economic windfall of a track likely hinges on the 
ability to attract a race to it that is sanctioned by a major 
organization such as the Indy Racing League (IRL) or NASCAR.
</p>
<p>
And several other developers in the Midwest will be seeking those 
coveted race dates.  New tracks are being considered in the 
Illinois cities of Kankakee and East St. Louis as well as the Quad 
Cities.  A major track is being proposed on the Michigan State 
Fairgrounds in Detroit.
</p>
<p>
And all of these would compete with tracks already operating in 
Indianapolis; Brooklyn, Mich.; and Milwaukee.
</p>
<p>
But airport commissioners said they were confident the alliance 
has the clout as owners of the two most lucrative races in the 
nation in the Indianapolis and Daytona 500s to lure a major NASCAR 
or Indy-car race here.
</p>
<p>
o Economic impact:
</p>
<p>
Commissioners have said their primary concern is the racetrack 
provide enough revenues to the Airport Authority to free it from 
the county tax rolls.  But the project won't likely get community 
support unless racetrack developers can convince them of its 
economic benefits.
</p>
<p>
The Alliance, unlike the other two groups, is more interested in 
focusing on construction of a racetrack rather than developing the 
land around it.  But their qualifications included references from 
other cities where the development strategies helped to create 
millions in annual revenues for various communities.
</p>
<p>
ISC operates tracks in both Darlington, S.C., and Talladega, Ala., 
where annual revenues generated from two major races at each 
facility exceed $50 million.  Darlington is a town of 8,000 people 
and Talladega a town of 20,000, both in relatively rural settings.
</p>
<p>
Roughly 150,000 people come to each of two major races at the 
Talladega Superspeedway each year, said Mayor Charles Osborne.  
The airport has a tower that is just used on two race weekends 
when as many as 600 planes a day will land there, he added.
</p>
<p>
"These people spend money here; that's the short of it," said the 
21-year mayor.  "Talladega is known worldwide, and it's all 
because of the racetrack.  That kind of publicity alone is worth 
millions of dollars."
</p>
<p>
o Environmental Impact:
</p>
<p>
Although the proposed site is over a mile from the nearest 
residential area, commissioners said they expect noise on race 
days to be a chief concern.
</p>
<p>
Darlington Mayor Ronnie Ward admitted he can always tell when it's 
race day in his city because he can hear the stock car engines 
rumbling from the other side of town in Darlington National 
Speedway.  But he said noise on two days out of the year is a fine 
trade-off for the economic benefits.
</p>
<p>
"It sounds like music to our ears," said the 13-year mayor of 
Darlington, which is the birthplace of stock car racing.
</p>
<p>
While Darlington speedway is 40 years old, Alliance officials said 
the modern racetrack designs limit the noise from the cars.  For 
example, large berms can be erected around a track to dampen 
engine noise.
</p>
<p>
o Infrastructure, transportation:
</p>
<p>
Airport officials stressed to the alliance they will not provide 
public money for the project, leaving the expansion of sewer 
systems for the track and the widening of roads solely at the 
developer's expense.
</p>
<p>
Alliance officials said a key reason for their interest in the 
location was its proximity to a railway line that leads into 
downtown Chicago, making the addition of a commuter station 
likely.  Several roads could be widened to handle increased 
traffic as well.
</p>
<p>
Although all three development groups addressed these issues in 
some measure, the Alliance proposal was selected over the DuPage 
Speedway and Entertainment Complex group's plan for an oval track 
and entertainment complex and the Geneva-based TAG Sports Ltd.'s 
plan for a Formula One road track surrounded by industrial 
complexes.
</p>
<p>
Undaunted, William Kautz, TAG president said his group is 
negotiating access to more than 1,000 acres of property in Kane 
County on which to build the Formula One road track and industrial 
complex he originally pitched for the airport property.
</p>
<p>
Kautz, whose Geneva business is in view of the airport property he 
sought to develop, said the TAG plan he submitted this fall and 
the global popularity of Formula One-style racing never received 
thorough consideration from airport officials who had been talking 
with The Motorsports Alliance for roughly a year.
